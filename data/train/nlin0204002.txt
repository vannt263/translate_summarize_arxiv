    "in the quasigeostrophic ( qg ) framework @xcite , a simplification of the navier stokes equations for describing the motion of a stratified and rapidly rotating fluid in a 3d domain , there are two classes of problems that immediately come to attention .",
    "the first ( charney type ) are the ones where attention is focussed on the interior of the domain ; the temperature is uniform along the boundaries and they play no dynamical role in the evolution of the system . the other class ( eady type ) of problems",
    "lead to the surface quasigeostrophic ( sqg ) equations .",
    "the potential vorticity in the 3d interior is forced to be zero and the dynamical problem is controlled by the evolution of the potential temperature at the 2d boundaries .",
    "working with a single lower boundary ( assuming all fields to be well behaved as @xmath1 ) , the equations making up the sqg system can be expressed as @xcite,@xcite ,    @xmath2    here @xmath3 is the potential temperature ( it is a dynamically active scalar due to the coupling of @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) , @xmath4 is the geostrophic streamfunction , @xmath5 the geostrophic velocity , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the horizontal laplacian , @xmath8 is the full 3d laplacian , the operator @xmath9 is defined @xcite in fourier space via @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the vertical component vorticity .",
    "the similarity in the evolution equations for @xmath3 and @xmath11 has been explored in detail by constantin , majda and tabak @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the structure of conserved quantities in both equations is exactly the same . to be precise , just as @xmath12,@xmath13 are conserved by the 2d euler equations similarly @xmath14,@xmath15 are conserved in the sqg system .",
    "the basic difference in the above two systems is the degree of locality of the active scalar . for the 2d euler equations the free space green s function behaves as @xmath16 implying a @xmath17 behaviour for the velocity field due to point vortex at the origin .",
    "in contrast , in the sqg equations the free space green s function has the form @xmath17 implying a much more rapidly decaying @xmath18 velocity field due to a point `` pt vortex '' at the origin @xcite . or , in fourier space one has @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the 2d euler and sqg equations respectively @xcite .",
    "hence the nature of interactions is much more local in the sqg case as compared to the 2d euler equations . + studying the properties of active scalars with different degrees of locality would be an interesting question in its own right @xcite but the specific interest in the sqg equations comes from an analogy with the 3d euler equations .",
    "this can be seen by a comparison with the 3d euler equations , which in vorticity form read ,    @xmath21^{j } = \\partial_{i } v^{j } { \\omega}^{i } \\label{4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is a divergence free velocity field , @xmath23 is the vorticity and @xmath24 . introducing @xmath25 , a `` vorticity '' like quantity for the sqg system which satisfies ( differentiating eq .",

    "( [ 5 ] ) with @xmath28 in eq . ( [ 4 ] ) it can be seen @xcite that the level sets of @xmath3 are geometrically analogous to the vortex lines for the 3d euler equations .",
    "similar to the question of a finite time singularity in the 3d euler equations ( which is thought to be physically linked to the stretching of vortex tubes ) , in the sqg system one can think of a scenario where the intense stretching ( and bunching together ) of level set lines during the evolution of a front leads to the development of shocks in finite time .",
    "the issue of treating the sqg system as a testing ground for finite time singularities has generated interest @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite in the mathematical community and the reader is referred to the aforementioned papers for details regarding this issue .",
    "+ in view of the similarities between the sqg and 2d euler equations and the level set stretching analogy with the 3d euler system , it is natural to inquire into the statistical / geometrical properties of the sqg active scalar within an appropriately defined `` inertial range '' .",
    "the broad aim is to compare these properties with the large body of work available for the 2d and 3d euler equations . in the second section",
    "we examine the pt field via global ( power spectrum , structure functions , ( @xmath29 ) spectrum ) and local ( wavelets ) methods .",
    "one of the few rigorous estimates that exist in fluid turbulence is that for the level set dimensions .",
    "the extraction of these dimensions and their agreement with analytical bounds is demonstrated .",
    "the third section is devoted to the examination of the dissipation field , the generalized dimensions of a measure based upon the dissipation field are calculated and commented upon . in the fourth section we focus our attention on the gradient fields , a simple derivation of the relation between the variety of scaling exponents is presented and the underlying assumptions are clearly stated . the failure of the cancellation exponent is demonstrated and a simple example is presented so as to put some of the ideas in perspective .",
    "a pseudo - spectral technique was employed to solve eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) numerically on a @xmath30 grid .",
    "linear terms are handled exactly using an integrating - factor method , and nonlinear terms are handled by a third - order adams - bashforth scheme ( fully de - aliased by the 2/3 rule method ) .",
    "the calculations were carried out for freely decaying turbulence .",
    "the initial conditions consisted of a large - scale random field , specifically a random - phase superposition of sinusoids with total wavenumber approximately equal to 6 , in units where the gravest mode has unit wavenumber .",
    "potential temperature variance is dissipated at small scales by @xmath31 diffusion .",
    "based on the typical velocity @xmath32 and scale @xmath33 of the initial condition , one may define a peclet number @xmath34 .",
    "the calculations analyzed here were carried out for a peclet number of 2500 . after a short time , the spectrum develops a distinct inertial range .",
    "as time progresses , energy and @xmath3 variance are dissipated at small scales , the amplitude decreases , and the effective peclet number also decreases . after sufficient time , the flow becomes diffusion - dominated and the inertial range is lost .",
    "analysis of other cases , not presented here , indicates that the results are not sensitive to the time slice or the peclet number , so long as the peclet number is sufficiently large and the time slice is taken at a time when there is an extensive inertial range . + the mean 1d power spectra from different stages of evolution can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . as these are decaying simulations the structure in the pt field is slowly dying out .",
    "the resulting increase in smoothness of the pt field can be seen via the roll off of the spectrum during the later stages . in spite of this",
    "a fairly clean power law is visible for a sizeable `` inertial range '' ( other runs with large scale initial conditions posessing various amounts of energy show similar behavior ) .",
    "we choose to concentrate on the particular stage which has the largest inertial range .",
    "the 2d power spectrum for this stage can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1c ] and a snapshot of the pt field itself can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1b ] .",
    "interestingly the 2d power spectrum seems to roll off at larger wavenumbers as compared to the 1d spectrum . in this stage",
    "the spectral slope ( from the 1d spectra ) between the scales 256 to 8 ( the scales are in terms of grid size ) is @xmath35 ( the other runs also showed slopes steeper than -2 ) .",
    "the slope from the 2d spectrum is @xmath36 ( due to the early roll off of the 2d spectrum , this slope is extracted between the scales 128 to 8) .",
    "previous decaying simulations @xcite obtained values near @xmath37 and seem to be consistent with our observations .",
    "a slope as steep as this suggests that the field being examined is smoother than expectations from a similarity hypothesis ( which yields a @xmath38 slope @xcite ) .",
    "a closer look indicates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1b ] ) that the field is composed of a small number of `` coherent structures '' superposed upon a background which has a filamentary structure consisting of very fine scales .",
    "this immediately brings to mind the studies on vorticity in decaying 2d turbulence @xcite,@xcite,@xcite wherein a similar coherent structure / background picture was found to exist .",
    "further analysis indicated that the vorticity field possessed normal scaling whereas a measure based upon the gradient of the vorticity ( precisely the enstrophy dissipation ) was multifractal . to proceed in this direction",
    "we introduce the generalized structure functions of order @xmath39 ,    @xmath40    here @xmath41 represents an ensemble average .",
    "the directional dependence is suppressed due to the assumed isotropy of the pt field .",
    "scaling behaviour in the field implies that one can expect the generalized structure functions to behave as @xcite ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 are the generalized scaling exponents , @xmath44 is of order unity for all @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the absolute value of the difference in @xmath3 over a scale @xmath47 . @xmath48 and @xmath47 are the inner and outer scale ( 8 and 256 respectively ) over which the power law in the spectrum was observed . + if the field being examined is smooth at a scale @xmath49 then the gradient at this scale would be finite and as a consequence @xmath50 ( due to the domination of the linear term in the taylor expansion about the point of interest ) ie",
    ". the scaling would be trivial .",
    "conventionally normal scaling is a term reserved for linear @xmath43 and any nonlinearity in @xmath43 is referred to as anomalous scaling . in 2d turbulence the velocity field is known to be smooth for all time if the initial conditions are smooth @xcite and hence @xcite @xmath43(velocity)@xmath51 .",
    "also , as mentioned , from the analysis of the vorticity field @xcite the scaling exponents for the vorticity structure functions were found to depend on @xmath45 in a linear fashion .",
    "plots of @xmath52 vs @xmath53 for the pt can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in all cases",
    "the scaling is valid upto @xmath54 , using these plots we extracted @xmath43 which are presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it is seen that the scaling is anomalous and in fact a best fit to the scaling exponents is of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "+ for the special case of @xmath57 , one can in principle relate the scaling exponent @xmath58 to the slope of the power spectrum ( @xmath59 ) via @xcite @xmath60 .",
    "this relation is only valid for @xmath61 ( note that this does not prevent the spectral slope from being steeper than @xmath62 ; it just implies that @xmath58 saturates at @xmath63 for smooth fields and the particular relation between @xmath58 and @xmath59 breaks down ) . in our case",
    "@xmath64 so the predicted spectral slope is @xmath65 which is near the observed mean value of @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 from the 2d spectrum ) . even though the scaling exponents give an idea of the roughness in the field ( anomalous scaling implying differing degrees of roughness ) there is a certain unsatisfactory aspect about the structure functions , namely , there is no estimate of `` how much '' of the field is rough .",
    "the following subsection aims to address this very issue .",
    "+      in scaling literature the roughness of a field is specified by means of an exponent @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) defined as @xcite ,    @xmath71    here @xmath69 is a function of position and it refers to the fact that the derivative of @xmath3 will be unbounded as @xmath72 if @xmath73 . as mentioned",
    "previously there is a lower scale associated with the problem so technically nothing is blowing up and in effect @xmath73 represents the regions where the derivative will be large as compared to the rest of the field .",
    "note that @xmath3 itself can not be singular due its conserved nature .",
    "the focus is on whether an initially smooth @xmath3 field becomes rough so as to cause the gradient fields to experience a singularity .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is by itself of not much use in characterizing @xmath3 ( as @xmath69 depends upon position ) , in fact a global view of the specific degrees of rougness of @xmath3 can be attained via the @xmath68 spectrum which we introduce next .",
    "+ an iso-@xmath69 set is defined as the set of all @xmath74 s where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the dimension ( to be precise @xmath76 should be viewed in an probabilistic fashion @xcite ) of an iso-@xmath69 set .",
    "the dimensions of iso-@xmath69 sets are derived by frisch @xcite .",
    "briefly , at a scale @xmath49 the probability of encountering a particular value of @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 for the 2d pt field and @xmath79 for 1d cuts of the pt field ) . by using a steepest descent argument in the integral for the expectation value of @xmath80 one",

    "+      all of the previous tools , the power spectrum , the @xmath68 spectrum and the structure functions extracted information in a global sense . to get a picture of the actual positions where the signal may have unbounded derivatives , and to get a qualitative feel of the spareseness of these regions",
    ", one has to determine the local behaviour of the signal in question .",
    "recently the use of wavelets has allowed the identification of local holder exponents in a variety of signals .",
    "the holder exponents are extracted by a technique known as the wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the modulus maxima refers to the spatial distribution of the local maxima ( of the modulus ) of the wavelet transform . in a crude sense",
    "the previous methods used ensemble averages of the moments of differences in @xmath97 as `` mathematical microscopes '' whereas in the wavelet method it is the scale parameter of the wavelet transform that performs this task .",
    "+ by using wavelets whose higher moments vanish one can detect sigularities in the higher order derivatives of the signal being analyzed @xcite .",
    "our previous results indicate that the pt field becomes rough , i.e. , the first derivatives of the pt field should be unbounded . hence , the particular wavelet we use is the first derivative of a gaussian whose first moment vanishes @xcite , i.e . , it picks up points where the signal becomes rough .",
    "the wavelet transform of a 1d cut of the pt field can be seen in fig .",

    "however , a closer look ( the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4b ] ) suggests , _ qualitatively _ , that the rough regions are sparsely distributed ( for eg . comparing with fig . 8 in arneodo et .",
    "al @xcite ) .",
    "this goes along with the observation in the last subsection that the rough regions were non space filling .",
    "in contrast , it has been found @xcite,@xcite,@xcite that the local holder exponents ( @xmath98 ) associated with a 1d cut of the velocity field in 3d turbulence satisfy @xmath99 for almost all @xmath74 ( the peak of the histogram being at @xmath100 ) implying that the velocity field in 3d turbulence is very rough or has unbounded first derivatives at almost all points .",
    "+      apart from being physically interesting , the level set ( iso-@xmath3 contour ) dimensions provide another link to the roughness of the scalar field . as the initial condition was a smooth 2d field , initially , any given level set ( @xmath101 for @xmath102 ) is a non space filling curve , i.e.",

    "it must be emphasized that these estimates come directly from the equations of evolution and are much more powerful than the phenomenological ideas we have been working with so far .",
    "the actual calculation @xcite,@xcite is of the area of an isosurface contained in a ball of specified size , given a holder condition on the velocity field ,    @xmath104    this area estimate leads to the bound ,    @xmath105    the bound in eq .",

    "( [ 7 ] ) due to the equality of the scaling exponents for the velocity field and the pt in the sqg system . + in passing we",

    "we performed calculations for a variety of nominal ( i.e. , near the mean ) level sets and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows the log - log plots used in the calculation of the box counting dimension .",
    "as is the case for 3d @xcite,@xcite there appears to be a crossover in @xmath108 , we find that the even though the dimension undergoes a change , the fractal nature seems to persist at smaller scales . for small @xmath49 , @xmath109 whereas for larger values of @xmath49 we find @xmath110 ( see the caption of fig .",

    "furthermore , as the bound is expected to be saturated above the cutoff we see that the computed value of @xmath108 for large @xmath49 is quite close to the analytical prediction . in all , apart from satisfying the analytically prescribed bounds ( and indirectly indicating roughness in the pt field ) , the level set dimensions indicate that initially non space filling level sets acquire a fractal nature in finite time .",
    "the effect of the inferred roughness in the pt field will , as mentioned previously , be reflected in the singular nature of the gradient fields . in this section",
    "we proceed to examine a variety of fields which are functions of the pt gradient .",
    "the aim is to see if we can actually detect the expected singularities , and if so , to characterize them .",
    "a physically interesting function of the gradient field is the pt dissipation , as it is connected to the variance of the pt field .",
    "the equation for the dissipation of @xmath3 can be obtained by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) by @xmath3 and averaging over the whole domain ,    @xmath113    here @xmath114 is the dissipation field .",
    "now consider the quantity @xmath115 ,    @xmath116    physically this is the average dissipation in a ball of size @xmath49 centered at @xmath74 . due to the smoothing via integration",
    "it is expected that @xmath115 will be fairly well behaved through most of the domain with intermittent bursts of high values concentrated in the regions where the pt field is rough .",
    "the multifractal formalism @xcite,@xcite , @xcite provides a convenient way to characterize such `` erratic '' or singular measures .",
    "the technique @xcite consists of constructing a measure ( @xmath117 with suitable normalization ) and using its moments to focus on the singularities of the measure .",
    "the domain in which the field is defined is partitioned into disjoint boxes of size @xmath49 and it is postulated ( see for eg .",
    "@xcite ) that moments of @xmath117 will scale as ,    @xmath118    where the sum goes over all the boxes into which the domain was partitioned .",
    "consider the set of points where the measure scales @xmath119 and denote the dimension of this set by @xmath120 ( again a probabilistic view is more precise ) . by similar considerations as for the @xmath76 spectrum",
    "it can be seen that @xcite ,    @xmath121    the function @xmath122 is further related to the generalized dimensions @xcite via @xmath123 .",
    "practically @xcite a log - log plot of the ensemble average of @xmath124 for different values of @xmath49 gives @xmath125 . by knowing @xmath126 one can use eq .",

    "+ again , as we expect the scaling of any physical quantity to be restricted to a range of length scales ( say @xmath128 to @xmath129 ) , it is preferable to work in terms of ratios of @xmath130 where @xmath129 is the outer scale , @xmath128 is the inner scale and @xmath131 . in these terms the generalized dimensions can be expressed as @xcite ,    @xmath132    where @xmath133 is the measure on the outer scale and @xmath134 is order unity for all @xmath45 ( a similar relation would hold if we replaced the @xmath135 in the right hand side by @xmath136 but with different @xmath134 s ) .",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] fails to exhibit a power law in @xmath49 .",
    "hence there is no meaningful way of extracting the cancellation exponents as they have been defined .",
    "unfortunately this implies that the relations derived in the previous section ( eqs .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] ) ) can not be used in this situation . in spite of this",
    ", we can see that as @xmath49 decreases the tangent to @xmath171 has a smaller slope which is consitent with the existence of a oscillatory cutoff at small scales .",
    "in summary , we have found that the pt field in the sqg equations appears to become rough within a specified range of scales .",
    "moreover , not only is there a heirarchy in the degree of roughness , the roughness is distributed sparsely in a qualitative sense .",
    "these conclusions are based on a combination of factors , namely , the algebraic power spectrum , anomalous scaling in the structure functions , a nontrivial @xmath68 spectrum , the nature of the wtmm map and the wrinkling of the pt level sets . the roughness in the pt field",
    "is expected to have an adverse effect on functions of the gradient field .",
    "this expectation is bourne out in the multifractal nature of the dissipation field . also , the singular nature of the gradient field in combination with its sign indefinetness led us to examine a sign singular measure based upon the gradient field .",
    "the failure to observe scaling in the sign singular measure serves , in our opinion , as a reminder that most scaling arguments are postulated at a phenomenological level and the underlying basis of why scaling is observed in the first place is a fairly subtle and unsettled issue .",
    "similarly the simple derivation of the relation between the variety of scaling exponents makes explicit some of the assumptions that are required for the validity of similar relations proposed in earlier studies . + regarding the more general question we posed in the very beginning of this paper , i.e. , where does the sqg active scalar stand with respect to both 2d and 3d turbulence , we have the following comments . with respect to the vorticity in the 2d euler equations the corresponding quantity in the sqg system is the pt .",
    "the coherent structure / fine background nature of the vorticity field @xcite,@xcite,@xcite carries over qualitatively to the pt field .",
    "the vorticity structure functions which showed normal scaling in the 2d euler system @xcite cross over to anomalous scaling in the sqg system .",
    "our conjecture is that the stronger local interactions in the sqg system are responsible for this anomalous scaling . in both these systems",
    "the vorticity and pt respectively are conserved quantities and hence any singularities one might experience are actually in the gradient fields , as is seen in the multifractal nature of the enstrophy dissipation in the euler system @xcite and the pt dissipation in the sqg system . + in the 3d euler case , the pt from the sqg equations is analogous to the velocity field and @xmath172 from sqg corresponds to the vorticity of the 3d euler equations .",
    "the roughness of the pt field is similar to the postulated roughness of the velocity field in the inertial range , a subtle difference being that the roughness in the pt appears to be sparse whereas indications are that the roughness in the 3d velocity field is present almost everywhere @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we re - emphasize that in both these cases the roughness is restricted to a range of scales , i.e. , no claim is made for an actual singularity in the corresponding gradients .",
    "similarly the anomalous scaling of the pt follows that of the velocity field in 3d but again it is not as strong as in the 3d case . the general theory developed @xcite for the deformation of scalar level sets in the 3d case is seen to carry over to the sqg equations .",
    "in essence the sqg equations follow the 3d euler equations but in a somewhat weaker sense .",
    "this `` weakness '' is clearly manifested in the behaviour of the gradients . in the 3d euler equations",
    "a sign singular measure constructed from the vorticity field shows good scaling properties and a cancellation exponent can be meaningfully extracted @xcite , whereas in the sqg equations a similarly constructed entity lacks scaling .",
    "+ the results presented in this paper have been for the most part diagnostic , in that they characterize the nature of the roughness of the potential temperature field in sqg dynamics .",
    "although we have exhibited anomalous scaling of the potential temperature fluctuations , we do not have a theory accounting for the observed form of @xmath43 .",
    "arriving at such a theory will be a major challenge for future work .",
    "our results point efforts in the direction of considering the dichotomy between smooth fields within large organized vortices , and a rather sparse set at the boundaries of and between vortices which exhibits a greater degree of roughness .",
    "the diagnostic results also suggest a means for distinguishing between sqg and euler dynamics in nature , in cases where only a tracer field can be observed , as in the gas giant planets ( notably saturn , jupiter and neptune , which exibit a rich variety of turbulent patterns ) .",
    "sqg dynamics should yield anomalous scaling corresponding to sparse roughness , whereas euler dynamics should yield normal scaling .",
