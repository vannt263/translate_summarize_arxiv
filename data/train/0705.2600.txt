    "experimental and theoretical studies of thin ferromagnetic films with an anisotropy axis perpendicular to the plane of the film have shown a diverse set of magnetic phases .",
    "in addition to uniformly magnetized states , strongly modulated ( striped ) patterns have been observed@xcite as the dipolar stray field overcomes the exchange interaction and forces an oscillation of the magnetization .",
    "the anisotropy value at which the modulation first occurs for is known as the reorientation phase transition ( rpt ) point .",
    "@xcite    this spontaneous modulation was first modeled by garel and doniach,@xcite using the assumption that the local magnetization lies fully out of the plane of the film .",
    "the magnetization alternates between regions of uniform up and down polarization with width determined by the competition between the ferromagnetic exchange and the dipolar interactions .",
    "refinements of this model have shown that near the rpt the domain structure is a cosine - like modulation of a nearly in - plane state,@xcite rather than the sharply defined striped domains that occur at higher values of the out - of - plane anisotropy .",
    "recently,@xcite we have found a universal phase diagram for zero - temperature transitions in thin film ferromagnets with perpendicular anisotropy and an external field applied perpendicular to the plane of the sample . in particular , we found analytic solutions for the boundary of metastability of uniformly magnetized phases in thin films .",
    "the uniformly up and down states decay along the lines @xmath1 respectively , while the canted phase decays at the boundary @xmath2 . these results",
    ", however , depend on the smallness of the parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the exchange length .",
    "this approximation is not valid for all thin films being studied in current experiments . in particular , it fails in experiments with thermally evaporated thin nickel films,@xcite where @xmath5 and @xmath6 ranges from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "three important effects come into play as the film thickness increases .",
    "first , the bound charges created on the top and bottom surfaces of the film by out - of - plane magnetization grow further apart , altering the strength of the dipolar interaction .",
    "second , the magnetization may vary across the thickness of the film .",
    "third , the direction of the in - plane magnetization may vary .",
    "the combination of the latter two effects allows the creation of closure domains that decrease the dipolar energy by following the local stray field .",
    "we find that at large thicknesses , the lowest energy modes are actually dominated by such domains .",
    "variational studies of the dependence of the domain structure on the film thickness have been made,@xcite but have not allowed for variation of the magnetization along the direction normal to the film . while these studies show the correct dependence of the rpt anisotropy on thickness , they predict domain sizes that decrease monotonically with the thickness , opposite the actual trend at large thicknesses.@xcite    this report examines the decay of uniform states in a thicker film via a spin wave analysis .",
    "we reduce the problem of finding the decay boundary of an in - plane state to a set of transcendental algebraic equations , and find the form of the initial decay modes .",
    "section [ model ] reviews the model for the magnetic free energy in a ferromagnetic film .",
    "section [ waves ] begins the spin wave analysis of the system around a uniformly polarized state , making general arguments about the shape and direction of the lowest energy fluctuations . in section [ modes ] , we find the governing eigenvalue equation for the spin wave modes in the @xmath9 direction ( normal to the film ) and find the general form of solutions to this equation .",
    "section [ decay ] completes the analysis by finding the mode with minimum energy and determines a set of equations that describe the reorientation phase transition point as a function of the thickness @xmath6 .",
    "the free energy for a thin ferromagnetic film of thickness @xmath6 can be separated into local and long - range parts .",
    "the local part includes the exchange , uniaxial anisotropy , and zeeman terms : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the 3-dimensional unit vector pointing along the magnetization . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider the case @xmath12 .",
    "experimentally , changing the temperature can serve to vary the anisotropy .",
    "it has been shown that the effective out - of - plane anisotropy decreases monotonically with increased temperature.@xcite    the long - range part of the energy is due to dipolar interactions : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the integration runs over all space . here",
    "@xmath15 is the profile of the film in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "@xmath16 if @xmath17 and @xmath18 otherwise .",
    "consider the free energy of small fluctuations around an in - plane state in which the magnetization points along the @xmath19 axis : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 small . by transforming to fourier space in the @xmath24-plane ,",
    "we can write the energy as an integral over modes that do not interact at second order in the fluctuations : @xmath25              + \\delta e_{2}[\\alpha_\\mathbf{k } ]              + \\delta",
    "e_{\\mathrm{dip}}[\\nu_\\mathbf{k},\\alpha_\\mathbf{k}]\\right).\\ ] ] this separation of modes is important because it means that the instability at the rpt will occur for a cosine - like fluctuation with a single wavelength .",
    "here @xmath26,\\nonumber\\\\          \\frac{\\delta e_{2,\\mathbf{k}}}{\\mu_0m^2 } & = &              \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2 } \\mathrm{d}z\\left [              \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}\\left|\\alpha'_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right|^2              + \\left|\\alpha_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right|^2\\frac{\\lambda^2              k^2}{2}\\right ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath27 where @xmath28 primes on @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote @xmath9-derivatives .",
    "we define the effective anisotropy @xmath29 as the natural anisotropy less the uniform part of the dipolar interaction .",
    "note that the dipolar energy couples symmetric fluctuations in @xmath22 to antisymmetric @xmath23 fluctuations and vice - versa .",
    "in general , fluctuations in the azimuthal angle @xmath30 allow a gain in energy by compensating for the magnetic charges created by fluctuations in the polar angle @xmath31 .",
    "it is these azimuthal fluctuations that cause the lowest energy mode to have its wave vector perpendicular to the initial magnetization ( i.e. in the @xmath32-direction ) . to see this ,",
    "consider a mode such that the wave vector of the oscillation is at some angle @xmath33 to the @xmath32-axis , with a profile for the azimuthal and polar fluctuations .",
    "for any such mode , we can find a corresponding fluctuation that has exactly the same dipolar energy but has its wave vector along the @xmath32-axis .",
    "namely , .",
    "further , since the azimuthal part of this new fluctuation is smaller by a factor of @xmath34 , it has a lower cost in the exchange energy . as a result ,",
    "the difference in energy between the two types of fluctuations , @xmath35\\ ] ] is a nonnegative quantity .",
    "since this is true of any profile for the azimuthal and polar fluctuations , it must be that the mode with the lowest energy cost has its wave vector oriented along the @xmath32-axis , perpendicular to the original direction of the magnetization .",
    "the exception to the above is when the wave vector of the oscillation lies along the @xmath19-axis , since the azimuthal fluctuation is then zero . in this case , however , no compensation can be made for the charges created by the fluctuations in @xmath31 , so the energy will be inherently higher .",
    "given that the lowest energy mode occurs with a wave vector along the @xmath32-axis , we work only in the subspace @xmath36 .",
    "the energy in this subspace is diagonalized by modes that obey the eigenvalue ( lagrange ) equations : @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 induced by the boundary terms used in deriving the above equations .",
    "the energy of each mode is proportional to its eigenvalue @xmath40 . for a given value of @xmath6",
    ", the reorientation phase transition will occur at the @xmath41 value when the lowest eigenvalue crosses zero , and some mode becomes soft .",
    "that is , at @xmath41 such that @xmath42 for some mode .",
    "note that the integral kernel in eq .",
    "( [ mode - eq ] ) is the solution to the differential equation @xmath43 , which has constant coefficients .",
    "since ( [ mode - eq ] ) is linear , and all the other terms in ( [ mode - eq ] ) have constant coefficients as well , we would expect eq .",
    "( [ mode - eq ] ) to be solved by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are constants .",
    "this ansatz works so long as the @xmath48 are the solutions to the equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and the conditions @xmath51 are satisfied .",
    "note that there are six ( not necessarily distinct ) values for @xmath52 , separated into three pairs @xmath53 .",
    "the boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces lead to @xmath54 these boundary conditions , combined with eqs .",
    "( [ mode - eq ] ) and ( [ ind - eq ] ) are symmetric in the @xmath9-direction , allowing the separation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 into modes with definite parity in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "a symmetric @xmath22 couples only to an antisymmetric @xmath23 and vice - versa .",
    "in the thinnest films , @xmath22 is uniform across the thickness , and @xmath23 is zero . as the thickness increases , we expect the parity of the lowest energy eigenmode to remain the same .",
    "the reason that a symmetric @xmath22 is favored is that the charges created on the top and bottom surfaces will be of opposite sign .",
    "this configuration has a lower energy cost than one with the same charges on the top and bottom surfaces , as would be the case for an antisymmetric @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath22 remains symmetric , then @xmath55 where the sum is over the three possible @xmath56 , the positive branch is taken for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the appropriately symmetrized combinations of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    in this case , the constraint equations ( [ constraint ] ) and ( [ bound ] ) reduce to the set @xmath62     on the film thickness .",
    "the line with @xmath63 marks is the exact solution , while the solid line is the thin film limit @xmath64    in order to find the reorientation phase transition boundary , we need not solve for @xmath58 , but we may rather note that in order for the above system to have a non - trivial solution , the determinant of the constraint conditions must be zero . combining this with the condition @xmath42 for the rpt , we find that @xmath65 where @xmath66     on thickness .",
    "the starred line is the exact solution .",
    "the solid line is the thin film limit @xmath67 . ]    together with eq .",
    "( [ ind - eq ] ) for the @xmath52 values , this completes the system of equations necessary to find both the @xmath68 value of the rpt and the initial wavenumber @xmath0 of the initial oscillation . since these equations are transcendental , no further analytic progress may be made .",
    "a plot of the numerically determined solution to these equations is found in figs .",
    "[ fig - kap ] and [ fig - k ] , along with a comparison to the previously determined thin - film limit@xcite .",
    "the thin film limit @xmath69 , @xmath67 can be seen to work well for thicknesses @xmath70 . as the thickness increases , the initial wavenumber reaches a maximum ( when @xmath71 ) , and decreases to zero ( uniform rotation ) for infinite thickness . for large thicknesses ,",
    "the wavenumber goes like @xmath72 , which is consistent with the linear dependence of domain size on thickness in thicker films.@xcite the critical value of the effective anisotropy changes monotonically from its thin film limit to the bulk limit @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "the dependence of the entire canted phase boundary on thickness may be derived in a similar fashion .",
    "further complications arise , however , as the characteristic equation ( [ ind - eq ] ) loses the symmetry that allows us to solve it as a cubic , and becomes fully sixth order .",
    "further , when the initial magnetization is tilted , the mode with the lowest eigenvalue will no longer have its wavevector parallel to the @xmath32-axis .",

    "in this report , we have developed the thickness dependence of the reorientation phase transition , deriving values for @xmath81 and @xmath82 that may be directly compared with experiment . in so doing ,",
    "we have connected recently derived thin film limits with the well - known linear dependence of domain size on thickness in thicker films .",
    "[ domain - fig ] shows the fluctuation patterns in the modes that first become unstable for a variety of thicknesses . in the thinnest films , the assumption that the magnetization is uniform across the thickness of the film is valid .",
    "the azimuthal angle is nearly zero everywhere .",
    "as the thickness increases , however , this assumption breaks down , leading to a drastically different landscape of magnetization as closure domains form near the upper and lower surfaces of the film . for very thick films",
    ", the lowest energy mode can have many repetitions of this closure behavior .",
    "as the anisotropy increases well beyond the rpt point , it is likely that many of these repetitions would be forced out , to accommodate the demand for more vertical magnetization .",
    "however , at the rpt point itself , this leads for very thick films to an essentially periodic structure in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "since the transition away from the in - plane state as the anisotropy increases is continuous,@xcite the ground state of a magnetic film that is just beyond the transition point should look much like the modes in fig .",
    "[ domain - fig ] that first become unstable . for such films",
    "we predict a strong , nearly oscillatory thickness dependence of the stray magnetic field , as the surface of the film becomes dominated alternately by out - of - plane magnetization , as for @xmath78 and @xmath80 , and in - plane closure domains , as for @xmath77 and @xmath79 .",
