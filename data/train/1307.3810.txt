    "a social network describing friendship relations is mathematically described by a finite simple graph .",
    "assume that everybody can chose among their friends a candidate for  president \" or decide not to vote .",
    "how many possibilities are there to do so , if cyclic nominations are discarded ?",
    "the answer is given explicitly as the product of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the eigenvalues of the combinatorial laplacian @xmath5 of @xmath4 .",
    "more generally , if votes can come in @xmath10 categories , then the number voting situation is the product of @xmath11 . we can interpret the result as counting rooted spanning forests in finite simple graphs , which is a theorem of chebotarev - shamis . in a generalized setup",
    ", the edges can have @xmath10 colors and get a formula for these rooted spanning forests . while counting subtrees in a graph is difficult @xcite in valiants complexity class @xmath12 , chebotarev - shamis show that this is different if the trees are rooted .",
    "the forest counting result belongs to spectral graph theory @xcite or enumerative combinatorics @xcite .",
    "other results relating the spectrum of @xmath5 with combinatorial properties is kirchhoff s matrix tree theorem which expresses the number of spanning trees in a connected graph of @xmath13 nodes as the pseudo determinant @xmath14 or the google determinant @xmath15 with @xmath16 . counting the number of rooted spanning trees in @xmath4 , a measure for complexity of the graph @xcite .",
    "of course , the number of people in the network is @xmath17 and by the handshaking lemma of euler , the number of friendships is @xmath18 .",
    "an other example of spectral - combinatorial type is that the largest eigenvalue @xmath19 of @xmath5 gives the upper bound @xmath20 for the maximal number of friends which can occur .",
    "a rather general relation between the sorted eigenvalues @xmath21 and degrees @xmath22 is @xmath23 ( @xcite theorem 7.1.3 ) . while working on matrix tree theorems for the dirac operator @xcite , we have found a generalization of the classical cauchy - binet theorem in linear algebra @xcite .",
    "it tells that if two @xmath24 matrices @xmath0 of the same size are given , then two polynomials agree : one is the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath25 matrix @xmath26 and the other is polynomial containing product of all possible minors of @xmath27 or @xmath4 : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the minor in @xmath30 masked by a square pattern @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the diagonal matrix with entry @xmath33 and for @xmath34 , the summand with the empty pattern @xmath35 is understood to be @xmath36 .",
    "the classical cauchy - binet formula is the special case , when @xmath37 and @xmath26 is invertible .",
    "the proof of formula  ( [ 1 ] ) is given in @xcite using exterior calculus . while multilinear algebra proofs of cauchy - binet have entered textbooks @xcite , the identity ( [ 1 ] ) appears to be new .",
    "we have not yet stated in @xcite that for @xmath38 , we get the remarkably general but new formula for classical determinants @xmath39 where the sum is over all minors and which is true for all matrices @xmath0 of the same size and where the right hand side is @xmath36 if @xmath40 is empty .",
    "if @xmath0 are column vectors , then the identity tells @xmath41 so formula  ( [ 2 ] ) generalizes the dot product . for square matrices",
    "@xmath42 , it implies the pythagorean identity @xmath43 where again on the right hand side the sum is over all minors .",
    "even this special case seems have been unnoticed so far . in the graph case , where @xmath44 for the incidence matrix @xmath45 =  gradient \" , formula  ( [ 3 ] ) implies for @xmath46 the relation @xmath47 for the laplacian @xmath5 .",
    "poincar has shown in 1901 that @xmath48 . actually , it is @xmath36 if and only if @xmath40 belongs to a subchain of the graph obtained by choosing the same number of edges and vertices in such a way that every edge connects with exactly one vertex and so that we do not form loops .",
    "these are rooted forests , collections of rooted trees .",
    "trees with one single vertex are seeds which when include lead to rooted spanning forests . from formula ( [ 3 ] ) follows a theorem of chebotarev and shamis ( which we were not aware of when first posting the result ) :    for a finite simple graph @xmath4 with laplacian @xmath5 , the integer @xmath3 is the number of rooted spanning forests contained in @xmath4 .    with the more general formula @xmath49 the forest theorem a bit further and",
    "get a more general result which counts forests in which branches are colored .",
    "lets call a graph @xmath10-colored , if its edges can have @xmath10 colors :    for a finite simple graph @xmath4 with laplacian @xmath5 , the integer @xmath50 is the number of rooted @xmath10-colored spanning forests contained in @xmath4 .",
    "we can also look at @xmath51 , in which case we count forests with odd number of trees with a negative sign .",
    "lets call a graph  even \" if it has an even number of edges , and  odd \" if it has an odd number of edges .    for a finite simple graph @xmath4 with laplacian @xmath5 , the integer @xmath52 is the number of @xmath10-colored rooted even spanning forests minus the number of @xmath10-colored rooted odd spanning forests in @xmath4",
    "the integer @xmath3 is also the number of simple outdegree=1 acyclic digraphs contained in @xmath4 .",
    "it is the number of voting patterns excluding mutual and cyclic votes in a finite network or the number of molecule formations with @xmath13 atoms , where each molecule is of the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 representing any radical different from hydrogen @xcite representing the root . in the voting picture ,",
    "the root is a person in the tree which is voted on , but does not vote .",
    "rooted trees are pivotal in computer science , because directories are rooted trees .",
    "a collection of virtual machines can be seen as a rooted forest .",
    "the colored matrix forest theorem can have an interpretation also in that there are @xmath10 issues to vote for and that the root person who does not vote can chose the issue . as mentioned",
    "the * forest theorem * is due to chebotarev - shamis @xcite .",
    "there are enumeration results @xcite and generating functions @xcite motivated by the jacobian conjecture or tree packing results @xcite .",
    "chung - zhao @xcite have a matrix forest theorem for the normalized laplacian which involves a double sum with weights involving the degrees of the vertices .",
    "the double sum is over the number of trees as well as the roots .",
    "+ the integer valued function @xmath55 on the category of finite simple graphs is positive since @xmath5 has nonnegative spectrum .",
    "the combinatorial description immediately implies that @xmath56 is monotone if @xmath57 : if @xmath30 is a subgraph of @xmath4 , then @xmath58 .",
    "knowing all the numbers @xmath59 does not characterize a graph even among connected graphs as many classes of isospectral graphs are known .",
    "since we know @xmath56 explicitly on complete graphs and graphs without edges , it follows that @xmath60 if @xmath13 is the order of the graph and @xmath10 colors are used .",
    "finally , lets mention that if @xmath4 is the disjoint union of two graphs @xmath61 and @xmath62 , then @xmath63 for any @xmath10 .",
    "this is both clear combinatorially as well as algebraically , because the graph @xmath4 has as the eigenvalues the union of the eigenvalues of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "extreme cases are the zero dimensional graph with @xmath13 vertices and no edges as well as the complete graph @xmath64 . in the zero dimensional case ,",
    "all trees are points and there is one possibility of a maximal spanning forest . already in the @xmath64 case , a direct computation using partitions and applying the cayley formula @xmath65 for the number of spanning trees in each subset of cardinality @xmath66 is not easy .",
    "the total sum @xmath67 looks like the cayley formula but this is a coincidence because all nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath5 are @xmath13 so that @xmath14 and @xmath68 look similar .",

    "we had only noticed this experimentally .",
    "+ according to @xcite , cayley knew also the number of rooted forests in @xmath64 as @xmath84 .",
