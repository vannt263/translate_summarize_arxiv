    "the possible existence of strange quark stars which are made entirely of u , d and s quarks is one of the most exciting aspects of modern astrophysics@xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that the compact objects such as x - ray pulsar her x-1 , x - ray burstar 4u1820 - 30 are likely strange stars@xcite-@xcite . in general , perhaps pulsars can be divided into two groups : one is modeled as neutron stars , and the other as strange stars .",
    "it is essential to distinguish these two candidates of pulsars from observations and to predict their properties furthermore .    usually , if strange stars do exist , the basic differences between strange stars and neutron stars are their dynamical properties and thermodynamical behaviors .",
    "for example , firstly , the mass - radius ( m - r ) relation of strange stars is quite different from that of neutron stars@xcite , especially , this relation depends on the rotation frequency of compact object .",
    "secondly , for rotating stars , the moment of inertia plays an important role to investigate their dynamical and electromagnetic behavior .",
    "the frequency of radio signals emitted from pulsars contain much information on the moment of inertia of the sources , which helps us not only to identify the type of pulsars  neutron stars or strange stars , but also to understand some phenomena and mechanism .",
    "it is generally accepted that the sudden spin - ups , glitches of pulsars , can be explained from their angular momentum transfer between their crusts and inner fluid .",
    "obviously , this transfer depends on their moments of inertia @xcite .",
    "thirdly , a newly born neutron star or strange star may pass through various stages of early evolution .",
    "these stages are determined by neutrino time scale and this scale is proportional to the star radius and the neutrino mean free path @xcite .",
    "these two physical quantities are dominated by temperature and the equation of state ( eos ) remarkably .",
    "in fact , due to the considerable difference between the eos of the strange quark matter and the neutron matter , we can distinguish the strange star and the neutron star from observation .",
    "the eos at finite temperature plays the key role to understand the behavior and the evolution of compact objects .",
    "the early calculations of eos for strange star are based on the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "later , many other models such as vector interaction and density - dependent scalar potential model @xcite , the quark mass density - dependent ( qmdd ) model @xcite@xcite and etc . were employed .",
    "the qmdd model was first suggested by fowler , rata and weiner@xcite and then used by many authors to study the stability and the thermodynamical properties of strange quark matter @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the basic hypothesis of the qmdd model is that the masses of u , d quarks and strange quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the baryon number density , @xmath4 is the current mass of the strange quark and @xmath5 is the vacuum energy density .",
    "eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) can easily be understood from the quark confinement mechanism , if we notice that the density @xmath3 approaches to zero and the masses of quarks tend to infinite when the volume of the system goes infinite @xcite .",
    "this confinement mechanism is almost the same as that of the mit bag model .",
    "it has been shown by many authors that the thermodynamical properties given by qmdd model are similar to that of mit bag model @xcite , and the m - r relation , viscosity radial oscillation of both rotating and non - rotating strange quark star described by qmdd model are qualitatively similar to those obtained with mit bag model @xcite .",
    "although the qmdd model can provide a dynamical description of confinement and explain many aspects of strange quark matter , it suffers from a basic drawback that it can not reproduce a correct lattice qcd deconfinement phase diagram because the quark masses are divergent when @xmath6 . to excite an infinite weight particle",
    ", one must pay the price for infinite energy , i.e. infinite temperature .",
    "it means that the qmdd model is a permanent quark confinement model .",
    "it is unable to describe the deconfinement process from neutron matter to quark matter inside the pulsar . to overcome this difficulty , in a series of previous papers @xcite-@xcite we suggested a quark mass density- and temperature- dependent ( qmdtd ) model which is based on a non - permanent quark confinement friedberg - lee model and proved that not only the above difficulty can be overcome but also many physical properties , for example , the stability , the deconfinement phase transition of strange quark matter@xcite-@xcite , the binding energy of dibaryon system can be explained @xcite . employing qmdtd model , gupta and his co -",
    "workers studied the m - r relation and the radial oscillations of proto strange stars and found a lot of reasonable and interesting results @xcite .",
    "but their study was limited to non - rotating proto strange stars only .",
    "this paper evolves from an attempt to extend the study of gupta et .",
    "al . to slowly rotating proto strange stars by using the qmdtd model .",
    "we will employ the hartle s method@xcite to sketch the main features about strange stars rotating with the frequency much smaller than the keplerian limit .",
    "we will discuss two cases : ( 1 ) uniform rotation where angular velocity @xmath7 ; ( 2 ) @xmath8 is a function of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which will be called differential rotation below .",
    "we will investigate the temperature dependence of m - r relation , of the moment of inertia and of the effect of frame dragging for proto rotating strange star .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the following section",
    ", we will give a brief review of the qmdtd model . by means of the hartle s formalism",
    ", we will discuss the slowly rotating strange star with uniform angular velocity @xmath8 in sec.iii , and that with differential rotation in sec.iv , respectively .",
    "the last section contains a summary .",
    "we will give a brief review of the qmdtd model in this section . the detail of this model",
    "can be found in refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "here we only write down the main steps which are necessary for calculating the eos for strange quark matter .    according to the qmdtd model , the masses of u , d and s",
    "quarks ( and the corresponding anti - quarks ) are given by @xmath11 @xmath12 comparing eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) with eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , the constant @xmath5 in qmdd model is replaced by @xmath13,\\quad 0 \\le t \\le t_c\\ ] ] @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the bag constant at zero temperature and @xmath16 is the critical temperature of quark deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the basic extension of qmdtd model is that @xmath17 depends on temperature because according to the friedberg - lee soliton bag model , the vacuum energy density of the bag equals the different value between the local false vacuum minimum and the absolute real vacuum minimum and this value depends on temperature @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic potential reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for u , d , s ( or @xmath20 ) quarks , @xmath21 is the corresponding chemical potential ( for anti - quark @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the single particle energy and @xmath24 is the mass for quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "@xmath25 is the density of states for various flavour quarks .",
    "the density of states of a spherical star has been calculated in ref.@xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28\\tan ^ { - 1 } ( \\frac{k}{{m_i } } ) - ( \\frac{{m_i } } { k } ) - \\frac{\\pi } { 2}\\},\\ ] ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total degeneracy . for a slowly rotating star , as a zero - th order approximation of the hartle s perturbation formalism , we use the density of states of a spherical cavity to calculate .    after getting the thermodynamic potential @xmath31",
    ", we can derive the energy density @xmath32 and the pressure @xmath33 .",
    "the results are @xcite@xcite-@xcite @xmath34 @xmath35 the extra terms in eqs.([12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) come from the dependence of the quark mass on the baryon density .",
    "the eos for strange quark star can be calculated from above formula and the result is shown in fig.[f1 ] , where the parameters are fixed as @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in this section , we employ hartle s formalism to study the slowly rotating strange star .",
    "we review this method briefly below and the details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the metric of non - rotating configuration is @xmath39 in hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined by the tov equations @xmath42",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath32 are the pressure and energy density of strange matter respectively and they relate each other by eos .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the radius of the star and is obtained by solving equation @xmath49 . for a slowly rotating star , the configuration is no longer static and spherically symmetric , but axially symmetric instead .",
    "the metric becomes @xmath50dr^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + r^2 ( 1 + 2k)[d\\theta ^2   + \\sin ^2 \\theta ( d\\varphi   - \\omega dt)^2 ] + o(\\omega ^3 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the angular velocity of a locally non - rotating inertial frame .",
    "expanding the metric in spherical harmonics , we find @xmath52 it can be proved from symmetric consideration that @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 vanish . therefore , under the slow rotation approximation the metric can be written as @xmath56dt^2   + e^{\\lambda } [ 1 + \\frac{{2(\\tilde m_0   + \\tilde m_2 p_2 ) } } { { r - 2 m } } ] dr^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + r^2 ( 1 + 2k_2 p_2 ) [ d\\theta",
    "^2   + \\sin ^2 \\theta(dt - \\omega d\\varphi ) ^2 ] + o(\\omega ^3   ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be calculated by tov equations ( [ 15])-([18 ] ) and @xmath59 .",
    "the rotation not only affects the metric , but also can change the distribution of pressure in the interior of the star . in a co - moving reference frame with the fluid ,",
    "the pressure correction is @xmath60 and the energy density correction @xmath61 here @xmath62 indicates the dimensionless corrections on the pressure .",
    "it can also be expanded as @xmath63 the stress - energy tensor in a rotating star is @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath8 is the angular velocity of fluid observed far from the star .",
    "noting that the perturbed einstein equation @xmath66 and the zeroth order equations @xmath67 , we get @xmath68    for the component of @xmath69 and @xmath70 of eq.([27 ] ) , we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 and",
    "we have defined @xmath73 . for the uniform rotation ,",
    "the angular velocity of fluid is a constant @xmath74 . therefore , the right hand side of eq.([28 ] ) vanishes .",
    "we expand @xmath75 @xcite : @xmath76 then the radial function of @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 at large @xmath9 , @xmath77 has the form @xmath79 at infinity where the spacetime is flat , @xmath80 must decrease faster than @xmath81 .",
    "because of @xmath82 , only the coefficient of @xmath83 in the @xmath84 expansion does not vanish and eq.([31 ] ) reduces to @xmath85 where @xmath86 . outside the star @xmath87 , the solution reads @xmath88 where the constant @xmath89 is identified as the total angular momentum of star and satisfies @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the determinant of metric of space components .",
    "the moment of inertia is simply @xmath92    the components @xmath93 and @xmath94 of eq.([27 ] ) and the terms @xmath95 in the expansion ( [ 20 ] ) lead to @xmath96 @xmath97 another constraint between the perturbations of the metric and those of energy and pressure comes from the hydrostatic equilibrium , i.e. the conservation of stress - energy tensor of perfect fluid @xmath98 . in the non - rotating case , it can be expressed as @xmath99 and in the rotating case , the corresponding perturbation equation reads @xmath100 for the terms @xmath95 , we find @xmath101 combining eqs.([41 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) , we find @xmath102 on the other hand , one can prove that the increasing of stellar mass @xmath103 and mean radius @xmath104 are given by @xcite @xmath105 @xmath106 when eos , @xmath8 and the boundary value of @xmath107 are given , we can integrate the tov equations until reaching the surface of the star @xmath49 .",
    "then we solve the eq.([33 ] ) , eq.([37 ] ) and eq.([42 ] ) to get the perturbations and finally calculate the moment of inertia by eq.([36 ] ) , the correction of the mass and radius in rotational case by eq.([43 ] ) and eq.([44 ] ) .",
    "we do this numerical calculation with the rotational frequencies smaller than the keplerian frequency @xmath108 which is required by the hartle s method@xcite .",
    "the mass - radius relation is one of the main results which distinguishes the strange stars and the neutron stars . in our calculation , the m - r relations not only depend on temperature @xmath109 , but also on angular velocity @xmath8 .",
    "fix the temperature @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the m - r curves for different @xmath8 are shown in fig.[f2a ] and [ f2b ] , respectively . by using fig.[f2a ] , fig.[f2b ] and eq.([44.5 ] ) , we find keplerian frequency @xmath112 , which is much larger than the frequencies used in fig.[f2a ] and fig.[f2b ] .",
    "it is seen that the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase with @xmath8 .",
    "to show the temperature effect more transparently , we plot the @xmath113 vs. @xmath8 curves for different temperatures in fig.[f3 ] , and see that for a fixed @xmath8 , @xmath113 increases with temperature .",
    "the effect of rotation becomes more and more important when temperature increases . from fig.[f3 ] , we can express the increase of the maximum mass by a simple formula @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the mass of the sun .",
    "this is very reasonable because all perturbations in hartle s method are assumed to be proportional to the square of the angular velocity of the fluid .",
    "the frame dragging is a general relativistic effect for a rotating object . to show the effect of frame dragging in a slowly rotating star , we plot the @xmath116 vs. @xmath117 curves for different temperatures in fig.[f4 ] . we see from fig.[f4 ] that this effect decreases when one approaches to the surface of star , and the dragging increases when temperature increases .      besides the m - r relation , much information for the configuration of a strange star",
    "is provided by its moment of inertia , which is one of the essential facts to understand many observational phenomenons .",
    "fig.[f6 ] shows the relation of the moment of inertia - mass .",
    "we see that the moment of inertia will increase with temperature .",
    "recently stella and vietri@xcite made a link between quasi - periodic oscillations(qpo ) and general relativistic lense - thirring precession caused by frame dragging .",
    "the low frequency of qpo , called horizontal - branch oscillations(hbo ) , is the frequency of the l - t precession of an inclined circular orbit with keplerian orbital frequency .",
    "psaltis et al.@xcite found that the ratios of the moments of inertia and masses @xmath118 of five bright sources ( gx 17 + 2 , cyg x-2 , gx 5 - 1 , sco x-1 , gx 340 + 0 ) satisfy @xmath0 .",
    "kalogera and psaltis@xcite calculate this ratio for various models of neutron star and argue that this requirement can not be satisfied for neutron stars .    here",
    "we suppose these five sources are strange stars and discuss whether the condition about @xmath119 is satisfied .",
    "fig.[f7 ] tells us that to satisfy the condition @xmath120 one require too high temperature which is over @xmath121 from the figure .",
    "this makes the validity of the suggestion by stella and vietri to be challenged also for the strange stars .",
    "we will study the configuration of differential rotating star , i.e. the angular velocity of the fluid @xmath122 , in this section . obviously , differential rotation will affect the evolution of a hot and new - born star . noting that hartle s method can only be used to study the uniform rotational star , an extension is needed when star is newly born and differentially rotating .",
    "it can easily be seen that the eq.([28 ] ) is still valid in the case of differential rotation , but the right hand side does not varnish now .",
    "expanding @xmath123 ( and then @xmath124 ) by the legendre functions @xmath125 eq.([28 ] ) becomes @xmath126 remember that outside the star , there is no fluid , @xmath127 , therefore , @xmath128 in eq.([47 ] ) still has the form @xmath129 a similar discussion can be made as that of the uniform rotation case : @xmath80 should decrease faster than @xmath81 if the spacetime is asymptotically flat . as a result , only the term with @xmath83 remains , while @xmath86 and @xmath130 are the functions of radial coordinate only .",
    "eq.([47 ] ) is simplified to be @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "the solution is @xmath133 here the constant @xmath89 can still be interpreted as the total angular momentum of the star .",
    "we obtain @xmath134 at the surface of star @xmath135 . in differential rotation ,",
    "the angular velocity of fluid depends on the radial coordinate .",
    "this means that in the internal regime of the star , a very thin layer @xmath136 of the fluid rotates with the same angular velocity @xmath137 and generates angular momentum of this layer @xmath138 , which satisfies , @xmath139 @xmath140 is the moment of inertia of this thin layer .",
    "hence the total moment of inertia of the star is @xmath141 where the eq.([35 ] ) is used at the last equality .",
    "since the differential rotation changes the derivatives of stress - energy tensor in hydrostatic equilibrium , we find @xmath142 where @xmath143 in the slowly rotating approximation , the effect of differential rotation is considered as perturbation .",
    "therefore we have @xmath144 for the term @xmath95 and @xmath145 , eq.([54 ] ) gives @xmath146 combining with eq.([38 ] ) , we find @xmath147 with boundary conditions @xmath148 .",
    "eq.([37 ] ) is valid in the differential rotation , because the derivatives of that @xmath137 do not appear in both of the right and left hand sides of eq.([27 ] ) as in the uniform rotation .",
    "we can solve eq.([37])([56])numerically .",
    "we employ the distribution of the angular velocity of the fluid @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the angular velocity of the core and @xmath151 is a constant , to investigate the influences of differential rotation . fixing the surface angular velocity @xmath152 , which is still smaller than the mass - shedding limit at the surface of a uniformly rotating star and",
    "satisfies the slowly rotating approximation , we show the m - r curves for @xmath137 at temperature @xmath110 and @xmath153 in fig.[f8a ] and fig.[f8b ] respectively .",
    "we see that the effect of @xmath151 on @xmath113 is remarkable , and the result reduces to the uniform rotation when @xmath154 .",
    "a differentially rotating strange star can sustain more mass than that of the uniform rotating configuration .",
    "the curves of the maximum mass increase @xmath155 vs. @xmath156 , the ratio of the angular velocity at the core and at the surface , are shown in fig.[f9 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath157 changes considerably with temperature and @xmath156 .",
    "a hot and differentially rotating strange star will suffer more maximum mass increase .",
    "similarly , we can address the effect of @xmath137 on the moment of inertia at temperature @xmath110 and @xmath153 .",
    "we show this effect in fig.[f10a ] and fig.[f10b ] respectively . comparing to fig.[f8a ] and fig.[f8b ] , we find that corresponding to the mass , the effect of @xmath151 on the moment of inertia is small .",
    "this is reasonable and expected , because in the slowly rotating approximation , the effect of rotation is too weak to change the star s shape ( almost spherical ) , which has strong influence on the moment of inertia .",
    "as shown by gupta et .",
    "al.@xcite , the parameters of the eos in the qmdtd model have few influences on the configuration of the strange star . we extend their work to the rotational case and have studied the slowly rotating strange star with uniform angular velocity , employing the qmdtd model and the hartle s method .",
    "the m - r relation , the moment of inertia and the frame dragging of strange star with different rotating frequencies are given .",
    "we found that mass , the moment of inertia and the frame dragging increase when temperature increases .",
    "we also found that the challenges of stella and vietri for hbo and the moment of inertia @xmath158 for five bright sources being neutron stars also exist for the strange star .",
    "we can not use the strange star to solve this difficulty .",
    "furthermore , we have extended the hartle s method to study the differential rotating strange star with @xmath159 .",
    "we found that the massive strange star can be prepared in the differential rotation . in the slowly rotating approximation , compared to the temperature the differential rotation has less effect on changing the moment of inertia of the star .",
