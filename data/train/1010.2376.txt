    "branching brownian motion ( bbm ) is a continuous - time markov branching process which plays an important role in the theory of partial differential equations  @xcite , in particle physics  @xcite and in the theory of disordered systems @xcite .",
    "it is also widely used in biology to model the genealogies of evolving populations , the spread of advantageous genes , etc . ,",
    "it is constructed as follows .",
    "start with a standard brownian motion ( bm ) ( we will often refer to brownian motions as `` particles '' ) , @xmath2 , starting at @xmath1 .",
    "after an exponential random time , @xmath3 , of mean 1 , the bm splits into @xmath4 independent bms , independent of @xmath5 and @xmath3 , with probability @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "each of these processes continues in the same way as first bm .",
    "thus , after time @xmath10 , there will be @xmath11 bms located at @xmath12 , with @xmath11 being the random number of offspring generated up to that time [ note that @xmath13 .",
    "an interesting link between bbm and partial differential equations was observed by mckean  @xcite : denote by @xmath14\\ ] ] the law of the maximal displacement .",
    "then , a renewal argument shows that @xmath15 solves the kolmogorov ",
    "piscounov or fisher [ f - kpp ] equation , @xmath16   \\\\[-8pt ]   \\nonumber   u(0 , x)&= & \\cases { 1 , & \\quad$\\mbox{if } x\\geq0,$\\vspace*{2pt}\\cr 0 , & \\quad$\\mbox{if } x < 0.$ } \\ ] ] the f - kpp equation admits traveling waves : there exists a unique solution satisfying @xmath17 with the centering term , the _ front _ of the wave , given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the unique ( up to translation ) distribution function which solves the ordinary differential equation @xmath20 the leading order of the front has been established by kolmogorov , petrovsky and piscounov  @xcite , whereas the logarithmic corrections have been obtained by bramson  @xcite , using the probabilistic representation given above .",
    "the limiting law of the maximal displacement has been studied intensely .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the so - called _ derivative martingale_. lalley and sellke  @xcite proved that  @xmath22 converges almost surely to a strictly positive random variable , @xmath23 , and established the integral representation @xmath24,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 a constant .",
    "thus the law of the maximum of bbm is a _ random shift _ of the gumbel distribution .",
    "moreover , it is known that @xmath26 where @xmath27 means that the ratio of the terms converges to a positive constant ; see , for example , bramson  @xcite and harris  @xcite .",
    "( there is emerging evidence that right - tails such as ( [ totheright ] ) , manifestly different from those of the gumbel , play an important role in a number of different fields , e.g. , in models on spin glasses with logarithmic correlated potentials by carpentier and le doussal  @xcite , and fyodorov and bouchaud @xcite . )",
    "contrary to the maximal displacement , very little is known on the full statistics of the extremal configurations ( first- , second- , third- , etc .",
    ", largest ) in bbm .",
    "such statistics are completely encoded in the extremal process , which is the random point measure associated to the collection of points shifted by the expectation of their maximum , that is , the point process @xmath28 the key issue of interest is to characterize the limit of this process , as @xmath29 .",
    "it can be shown that the limit of the point process exists using bramson s analysis  @xcite on the convergence of solutions of the kpp equations with appropriate initial conditions  @xcite .    for given realization of the branching , the positions @xmath30 form a  gaussian process indexed by @xmath31 with correlations given by the _ genealogical distance _",
    "@xmath32 ( the time to first branching of the common ancestor )",
    ". the information about the correlation structure of any subsets of particles in bbm is encoded in their genealogical distance .",
    "this applies , in particular , to the subset of extremal particles , for which the following result was proved in  @xcite : with probability tending to 1 , branching can happen only at `` very early times , '' smaller than @xmath33 with @xmath34 as @xmath35 , or at times `` very close '' to the age of the system , namely greater than @xmath36 for @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "( the reason for this notation , in particular the use of the subscripts , will be explained below . )",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath39 the set of particles in the subset @xmath40 , we have :    [ genealogyabktheorem ] for any compact @xmath41 , @xmath42 = 0.\\ ] ]    figure  [ fig1 ] presents a graphical representation of the genealogies of extremal particles of bbm .",
    "theorem  [ genealogyabktheorem ] gives insight into the limiting extremal process of bbm .",
    "in fact , it suggests the following picture , which holds with overwhelming probability in the limit when first @xmath29 , and @xmath43 after that .",
    "first , ancestries in the interval @xmath44 $ ] can not be ruled out : this regime generates the derivative martingale appearing in the work of lalley and sellke  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the ancestors of the extremal particles evolved independently for most of the time ( namely in the interval @xmath45 $ ] ) , the extremal process must exhibit a structure similar to a poisson process .",
    "finally , since ancestors over the period @xmath46 $ ] also occur , it is natural to conjecture that _ small grapes _ of length at most @xmath37 , that is , clusters of particles with very recent common ancestor , appear at the end of the time - interval .",
    "( according to this picture , the subscript in @xmath33 refers to _ derivative martingale _ , while that in @xmath47 stands for _ grape_. )    it is the purpose of this work to make part of this picture rigorous . in section  [ mainresults ]",
    "we present our main result , which is proved in section  [ proofs ] . in section  [ secconvection ]",
    ", we introduce a cluster point process , which we conjecture to correspond in the limit to the extremal process of bbm .",
    "we also discuss the cluster point process in relation to the work of chauvin and rouault  @xcite on bbm conditioned to perform unusually large displacements , and in relation to the _ tidal wave conjecture _ of lalley and sellke  @xcite .",
    "detailed properties of this cluster point process will be the subject of a subsequent paper  @xcite .",
    "despite the rather clear image described above , a frontal attack on the extremal process appears to be difficult .",
    "this is in particular due to the fact that one has to take into account the self - similarity of bbm which is first and foremost detectable in the small clusters , an issue which remains rather elusive ( see section  [ secconvection ] for more on this ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the picture naturally suggests the existence of an underlying point process obtained from the extremal particles by a thinning procedure , which we describe next .",
    "assume that the positions of particles at time @xmath0 are ordered in decreasing order : @xmath48 the inequalities will in fact be strict for almost all realizations of bbm for any deterministic time @xmath0 .",
    "define also @xmath49 the pair @xmath50 admits the following natural _",
    "thinning_. since the matrix @xmath51 is constructed from the branching of the bbm , the relation @xmath52 is transitive for any @xmath53 : @xmath54 in particular , for any @xmath55 , this relation defines an equivalence relation on the set @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding equivalence classes are just the particles at time  @xmath0 that had a common ancestor at a time later than @xmath57 .",
    "we want to select a representative of each class , namely the maximal particle within each class , and then consider the point process of these representatives . for any @xmath55 , the of the process @xmath58 , denoted by @xmath59 , is defined recursively as follows : @xmath60 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber i_k&=&\\min\\ { j > i_{k-1}\\dvtx   \\overline{q}_{i_lj}(t)<q ,   \\forall l\\leq k-1\\};\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath61 where it is understood that @xmath62 when an index @xmath63 in @xmath56 satisfying @xmath64 can no longer be found .",
    "the procedure selects the maximal position in each equivalence class defined from the relation .",
    "in addition , it is easily checked that the thinning map , @xmath65 considered at the level of realizations , is a continuous function on the space of pairs @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a sequence of ordered positions and @xmath68 is a  symmetric matrix with entries in @xmath69 $ ] , satisfying ( [ eqnultra ] ) ( when this space is equipped with the product topology in each coordinate of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "the thinning map can also be applied to @xmath0-dependent values of @xmath70 .",
    "for example , take @xmath71 , where @xmath47 is fixed @xmath0 . in this case , the thinning effectively retains those particles which are extremal within the class defined by a `` very recent '' common ancestor , which we refer to as _ cluster - extrema_. figure  [ fig2 ] presents a graphical representation of the set of such particles .",
    "our main result states that all such thinned processes converge to the same randomly shifted poisson point process ( ppp for short ) with exponential density .",
    "[ convergencethinned ] for any @xmath72 , the processes @xmath59 converge in law to the same limit , @xmath73 .",
    "also , @xmath74 moreover , conditionally on @xmath23 , the limit of the derivative martingale ( [ eqnderiv ] ) , @xmath75 where @xmath25 is the constant appearing in ( [ totheright ] ) .",
    "the point process @xmath76 has a fundamental connection with the limiting extremal process of bbm . to see this ,",
    "suppose for simplicity that the processes @xmath77 induced by the law of bbm converge , as @xmath29 , to a process , @xmath78 .",
    "( the laws of these processes are in fact tight because the law of @xmath79 is itself tight ; see , e.g. , corollary 2.3 in  @xcite , and that @xmath80 $ ] for any  @xmath81 .",
    "convergence would evidently follow from a complete characterization of the extremal process . )",
    "it follows from theorem  [ genealogyabktheorem ] that @xmath82 is either @xmath1 or @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests :    1 .   to define a cluster of particles as the maximal set of particles such that @xmath84 for all @xmath81 in the set ; 2 .   to look at the process of the maxima of each cluster , denoted by , say , @xmath85 , defined as in ( [ eqnthin ] ) , but where @xmath86 .",
    "we claim that @xmath85 is in fact the limit @xmath76 of @xmath87 in theorem  [ convergencethinned ] .",
    "indeed , in view of the continuity of the thinning map ( [ eqnthinmap ] ) , @xmath59 converges to the process , @xmath88 , constructed from @xmath78 for all @xmath70 .",
    "but , for any @xmath72 , the processes , @xmath88 , constructed from @xmath78 using ( [ eqnthin ] ) are equal trivially to @xmath85 , since @xmath82 is either @xmath1 or @xmath83 .",
    "the claim then follows from theorem  [ convergencethinned ] .",
    "the point process describing the particles at the frontier of bbm in the limit of large times is thus formed by two `` types '' of particles : those coming from the randomly shifted ppp with exponential density , the cluster - extrema ; and the second type of particles , those forming the clusters .",
    "clearly , particles in the same cluster always lie on the left of the corresponding poissonian particles , by the very definition of the cluster - extrema .",
    "it remains an open question to characterize the law of the clusters ( see section  [ secconvection ] for some conjectures ) .",
    "we remark that , since @xmath37 as @xmath35 , the thinned process @xmath89 is obtained from the extremal one by removing only a small number of particles , those which have genealogical distance smaller than @xmath36 from the maximum in their class .",
    "it is rather surprising at first sight ( but not quite when seen under the light of theorem  [ genealogyabktheorem ] ) that such a point process converges , despite the high correlations among the branching brownian particles , to a  ppp with exponential density .",
    "theorem  [ convergencethinned ] also provides insights into a result by bovier and kurkova  @xcite , who addressed the weak limit of the gibbs measure of bbm , the random probability measure on @xmath90 attaching weights @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the inverse of temperature . to see this ,",
    "let us first recall the following .",
    "consider the random set @xmath93 where the @xmath94 s are generated according to a ppp with density @xmath95 on the real axis , @xmath96 and @xmath23 as in theorem  [ convergencethinned ] .",
    "construct then a new random set @xmath97 where @xmath98 . for @xmath99",
    ", it is easily seen that @xmath100 almost surely , in which case the normalization @xmath101 is well defined , and the law of the normalized collection @xmath102 is the poisson  dirichlet distribution with parameter @xmath103 , which we shall denote by @xmath104 .",
    "in a somewhat indirect way ( by means of the so - called ghirlanda  guerra identities , which avoid the need to first identify the limiting extremal process ) bovier and kurkova proved that , in the low temperature regime @xmath99 , the gibbs measure @xmath105 converges , in the limit of large times , to the @xmath106 ; together with our theorem  [ convergencethinned ] , this naturally suggests that the gibbs measure of bbm is concentrated , in fact , on the _ cluster - extrema_.    finally , theorem  [ convergencethinned ] sheds light on a property of the extremal process of bbm that was conjectured by brunet and derrida @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the statistics of the leading particles are invariant under superposition in the sense that the extremal process of two independent branching brownian motions has the same law , up to a random shift , as the extremal process of a single one .",
    "this property at the level of the entire process is likely to involve specific features of the laws of the individual clusters . on the other hand , at the level of the thinned process",
    ", it is a straightforward consequence of theorem  [ convergencethinned ] , since the law is poisson with exponential density .",
    "[ corsuperposition ] let @xmath107 and @xmath108 be the extremal processes ( [ extremalprocess ] ) of two independent branching brownian motions .",
    "denote by @xmath23 and @xmath109 the pointwise limit of their respective derivative martingale .",
    "then , for any @xmath72 , the law of the @xmath70-thinning of @xmath110 conditionally on @xmath23 and @xmath109 converges to @xmath111 in particular , the thinned process of @xmath110 has the same law in the limit as the thinned process @xmath112 of a single branching brownian motion , up to a random shift .    as mentioned before ,",
    "theorem  [ convergencethinned ] is a natural consequence of theorem  [ genealogyabktheorem ] .",
