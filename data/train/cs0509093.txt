    "pioneering work by @xcite it has become clear that the use of multi - antenna arrays in transmission and reception can lead to significantly increased bit - rates .",
    "this has led to a flurry of work calculating the narrowband ergodic mutual information of such systems , i.e. the mutual information averaged over realizations of the channel , using a variety of channel models and analytic techniques .",
    "for example , the ergodic capacity was calculated asymptotically for a large number of antennas,@xcite or for large and small @xcite signal - to - noise ratios , using a variety of assumptions for the statistics @xcite of the fading channel .    to better understand the characteristics of realistic information transmission through fading channels , it is important to analyze the full distribution of the mutual information over realizations of fading .",
    "for example , the outage capacity @xcite is sometimes a more realistic measure of capacity for delay constrained fading channels .",
    "in addition , the distribution of the mutual information provides information about the available diversity in the system @xcite : the smaller the variance , the lower the probability of outage error when transmitting at a fixed rate .",
    "finally , having an analytic expression for the distribution of the mutual information allows one to simulate a system of multiple users in a simple way.@xcite recently , @xcite analytically calculated the first few moments of the distribution of the narrowband mutual information , asymptotically for large antenna numbers with spatial correlations .",
    "this analysis showed that the distribution is approximately gaussian even for a few antennas , also seen in @xcite .",
    "more recently , other methods were devised to calculate all moments of the mutual information distribution exactly for some channel types .",
    "@xcite also , @xcite calculated the ergodic mutual information in the large antenna limit for independent non - identically distributed ( ind ) channels , and extended their results to correlated channels with special restrictions on the correlations of different paths .",
    "the above literature did not analyze the statistics of the mutual information for gaussian channels with general non - kronecker - product correlations .",
    "@xcite these types of channels are becoming increasingly important to study , as it has recently been proposed that they appear in several situations , such as channels for generally correlated antennas with multiple polarizations .",
    "@xcite    furthermore , the above works have generally focused on the case of narrowband flat - fading channels .",
    "however , the use of wide - band signals with non - trivial resolvable multipath necessitates the analysis of the mutual information in the presence of multipath .",
    "@xcite showed that the capacity of the wideband channel depends only on narrowband quantities , such as total average power etc .",
    "subsequently , other authors have analyzed the wideband ergodic capacity using asymptotic methods .",
    "@xcite in a first attempt to describe the wideband distribution of the mutual information , @xcite suggested that the distribution is gaussian , if the number of independent paths is large .",
    "however , in many instances of interest the number of paths seen is small . @xcite it would thus be useful to analyze the effects of multi - path on the wideband mutual information of gaussian mimo fading channels of _ arbitrary _ multipath behavior in an analytic fashion .",
    "although the exact methods mentioned above @xcite can calculate all moments of the distribution for narrowband channels , they can not be generalized to multi - path channels .",
    "therefore , to make progress , one needs to rely on asymptotic methods .    in this paper",
    "we extend work done in @xcite to provide analytic expressions for the statistics of the mutual information in the presence of multi - path with general spatially correlated channels .",
    "we assume that the instantaneous fading channel is known to the receiver but not the transmitter .",
    "our results generalize the mutual information results of @xcite for gaussian channels to arbitrary zero - mean gaussian correlated channels .",
    "the paths may or may not have the same delay .",
    "the methods used here apply the concept of replicas , which was initially introduced in statistical physics for understanding random systems @xcite , but in recent years have seen several applications in information theory . @xcite .",
    "in particular , we obtain the following results :    * we use the replica method to calculate the moment generating function of the mutual information , averaging over general multipath , non - kronecker product channels . using this approach",
    "we derive expressions for its first three moments ( mean , variance and skewness ) . as in @xcite",
    "we find that for large antenna numbers @xmath0 , the average of the distribution is of order @xmath0 , the second moment of the distribution is of order unity , and the third moment is order @xmath1 respectively , while all other moments scale with higher powers of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath0 the mutual information distribution approaches a gaussian .",
    "therefore , the outage mutual information can be expressed simply in terms of the mean and the variance of the distribution ( section [ sec : math_framework ] ) .",
    "* we optimize the mean mutual information with respect to the input signal distribution to obtain the ergodic capacity ( section [ sec : ergodic_capacity ] ) .",
    "* we demonstrate the dependence of the whole distribution of the mutual information on the specifics of the channel by calculating the mean and variance of the mutual information for a number of simple multipath channels .",
    "* we also compare these gaussian distributions with numerically generated ones and find very good agreement , even for a few antennas .",
    "this validates the analytical approach presented here for use in realistic situations with small antenna numbers .      in the remainder of this section",
    "we define relevant notation . in section",

    "subsequently , in section [ sec : math_framework ] the mathematical framework of the method to calculate the generating function of the mutual information is presented .",
    "also , the calculation of the ergodic capacity ( section [ sec : ergodic_capacity ] ) , its variance ( section [ sec : variance_mutual_info_iid ] ) and the higher order moments of the distribution ( section [ sec : higher_order_terms ] ) are discussed .",

    ".      two general types of integrals over matrix elements will be dealt with and the following notation for their corresponding integration measures will be adopted . in the first type we will be integrating over the real and imaginary part of the elements of a complex @xmath20 matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the integral measure will be denoted by @xmath21 the second type of integration is over pairs of complex square matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "each element of @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be integrated over a contour in the complex plane ( to be specified ) .",

    "we will reserve the notation @xmath30 $ ] for expectations over transmitted signals .",
    "we consider the case of single - user transmission from @xmath15 transmit antennas at a base station to @xmath16 receive antennas at a mobile terminal over a fading channel with multiple paths with a finite bandwidth .",
    "we assume that the channel coefficients are known to the receiver , but not to the transmitter .",
    "the transmitted signal can be written in terms of discrete a time series representing the signals at discrete time steps @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 the inverse available bandwidth .",
    "thus we can use the following simple tap - delay model@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath15-dimensional signal vector transmitted at time @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the corresponding @xmath16-dimensional received signal and noise vectors .",
    "@xmath37 is assumed an i.i.d .",
    "vector with each of its elements drawn from @xmath13 , while @xmath38 is the @xmath39-dimensional complex channel matrix at delay times @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is integer - valued .",
    "of course , @xmath38 can be interpreted in a wider sense as an appropriately filtered version of the channel over the delay interval @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "@xcite note that in general all paths need not arrive with different delays , i.e. we have @xmath43 , with equality when the @xmath44th and @xmath45th paths arrive within the same delay interval .",
    "in fact , all paths may be assumed to arrive over the same delay interval .",
    "the analysis of multipath channels is simplified considerably by fourier - transforming the transmitted and received signal vectors . in this case the fourier - transformed received signal is solely a function of the corresponding fourier component of the transmitted signal @xmath46 where the fourier transform of the transmitter signal vector @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 with similar definitions for the fourier components @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is the fourier transform of the channel impulse response given by @xmath52 note that ( [ eq : fouriertrans_def_infinite ] ) implies that each symbol vector @xmath47 transmitted over a single frequency is spread over infinite times . as a result",
    ", it sees no interference from other frequency components due to multi - path . in practice , and in order to avoid mixing between close frequencies due to doppler fading , one has to transmit each symbol over a finite time window , therefore essentially using a discrete set of frequency components , e.g. @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "the number of discrete frequency components @xmath55 is usually chosen so that the symbol duration is less than the coherence time of the channel @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "one can then send different symbols one after the other .",
    "however , there is a residual isi interference due to multipath and the finite fourier modes are no longer orthogonal .",
    "various methods have devised to restore orthogonality , such as the inclusion of a cyclic prefix .",
    "@xcite these issues will be ignored here and we will use the discrete fourier mode version of ( [ eq : channel_eq_cont_ft ] ) given by @xmath58 where the index @xmath59 represents the symbol index , @xmath60 is the fourier mode index with @xmath54 , @xmath61 is the corresponding channel fourier component for @xmath62 .",

    "next , we would like to characterize the statistics of the channel matrices @xmath38 in ( [ eq : basic_channel_eq ] ) , which are random due to fading .",
    "in particular , they are assumed to be zero - mean , independent gaussian random matrices .",
    "in addition , we assume the correlations between elements of @xmath38 to be as follows : @xmath74 where the expectation @xmath75 is over the fading matrices @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the signal to noise ratio , and the @xmath15- and @xmath16-dimensional correlation matrices for the @xmath44-th path at the transmitter and receiver , respectively .",
    "underlying the structure of the above correlations is the assumption that different paths have uncorrelated channels.@xcite each path is assumed to have correlations in the form of a kronecker product .",
    "this is certainly valid when each path corresponds to a single scattered wave , in which case each of the corresponding correlation matrices have unit rank .",
    "the above channel model is in agreement with adopted channel models in third generation standards @xcite .",
    "we comment that an interesting special case occurs when _ all _ the delays @xmath41 take the same value , i.e. arrive within the same @xmath33 interval ( see section [ sec : special case 2 : narrowband multipath ] ) .",
    "this represents a _ narrowband _ channel with non - kronecker product ( or non - factorizable ) correlations . in other words",
    "we could write the analogous simple narrowband channel relation @xmath79 where @xmath80 the matrices @xmath81 have correlations of the form ( [ eq : g_lg_l*_gen_corrs ] ) above .",
    "we note that such a form includes general models of polarization mixing with general correlation matrices between the different polarization components @xcite .",
    "for example , the correlations of a multipath channel with antennas of different polarizations can be written compactly as @xmath82^t % % \\ , \\vec p \\ , \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } % % 1 & x \\\\",
    "% % x & 1 % % \\end{array } \\right ] % % \\left[\\begin{array}{c } % % r^{l , v}_{ij } \\\\",

    "the non - zero values of these matrices can be chosen to be , for example , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "although this mapping is not unique , it demonstrates the generality of our method .",
    "it should be noted that , since the receiver / mobile terminal is usually assumed to be located deep inside the clutter , the received signal tends to have wide angle - spread , thereby making the differences in the angles of arrival of different paths less distinguishable .",
    "therefore , it is sometimes reasonable to assume that the receiver correlations @xmath78 are path - independent , i.e. @xmath93 this assumption is not as easily met at the transmitter / base station , where the nearest scatterers are typically further separated , thereby making the @xmath77 typically different . a further simplification of the above is the case when the receive antennas are uncorrelated , which is discussed in @xcite .    as a result of the above , @xmath61 , the fourier transform of @xmath94 ( [ eq : g_k_ft_def ] ) is also gaussian with correlations @xmath95    for the case of narrowband channels mentioned above in ( [ eq : narrowbandch1 ] ) , ( [ eq : narrowbandch2 ] ) , @xmath61 is nonzero only for @xmath96 , therefore @xmath97 with @xmath98 given in ( [ eq : narrowbandch2 ] ) .",
    "the mutual information of each of the frequency components @xmath60 is given by@xcite @xmath99 the @xmath100 above ( and throughout the whole paper ) represents the natural logarithm and thus @xmath101 is expressed in nats .",
    "the total mutual information over all frequency components is then @xmath102      the distribution of the mutual information can be characterized through its moments .",

    "for example , the ergodic mutual information , i.e. the average of the distribution is given by @xmath109 similarly , the variance of the distribution is @xmath110 its the skewness of the distribution is @xmath111 and so forth .",
    "note that since @xmath112 depends only on @xmath61 and @xmath113 , to evaluate the ergodic average ( [ eq : ave_mut_info_wb_def ] ) we can perform the average for each term in the sum in ( [ eq : line22 ] ) separately , neglecting any correlations between @xmath61 s with different @xmath60 indices .",
    "thus for evaluating the ergodic average , the only correlation of relevance is @xmath114 which turns out to be @xmath60-independent , as seen in ( [ eq : g_kg_k*_gen_corrs ] ) .",
    "therefore the only @xmath60-dependence of each term in the sum in ( [ eq : ave_mut_info_wb_def ] ) is through @xmath113 . as a result",
    "the optimal @xmath113 will be @xmath60-independent .",
    "we will thus henceforth assume that @xmath113 is chosen to be a @xmath60-independent quantity @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "the wideband ergodic capacity becomes just @xmath55 times its narrowband counterpart @xcite .",
    "this @xmath60-independence of the mean mutual information will be of use in the next section .",
    "in contrast , in evaluating higher moments of the distribution such as the variance , as is easily seen from ( [ eq : kkp ] ) , we will have to consider cross correlations between @xmath61 and @xmath115    finally , it should be emphasized that the distribution of the mutual information can also be completely characterized by the outage mutual information@xcite , obtained by inverting the expression below with respect to @xmath116 @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the probability that the mutual information is less than a given value @xmath116 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the statistics of the wideband mutual information @xmath101 in ( [ eq : mut_info_wb_def ] ) for general zero - mean gaussian channels . in this section",
    "we describe the basic steps to derive analytic expressions for the first few cumulant moments of @xmath101 , valid formally for large antenna numbers . in this limit",
    "it has been shown elsewhere @xcite that the narrowband mutual information distribution becomes asymptotically gaussian .",
    "thus the first two moments can describe the outage mutual information ( [ eq : outage_mut_info_def ] ) . using the mathematical framework of @xcite",
    "we will show that this gaussian character holds also for wideband channels .    to obtain the moments of the mutual information distribution we need to calculate @xmath103 in ( [ eq : g_nu_def ] ) for @xmath119 in the vicinity of @xmath105 . to achieve this",
    "we will employ the replica assumption discussed in @xcite .",
    "[ ass : replica ] @xmath103 evaluated for positive integer values of @xmath119 can be analytically continued for real @xmath119 , specifically in the vicinity of @xmath120 .",
    "this assumption , used also in @xcite , alleviates the problem of dealing with averages of logarithms of random quantities , since the logarithm is obtained after calculating @xmath103 .    in appendix",
    "[ app : derivation of gnu_s ] we show that @xmath103 can be expressed as an integral over @xmath121 complex matrices @xmath122 , @xmath123 , with @xmath124 @xmath125 where the integration metric was defined in ( [ eq : dmutr1 ] ) and @xmath126 where @xmath127 is an @xmath128 matrix related to @xmath123 via @xmath129 where we have explicitly written out the components of the matrices here with @xmath130 ranging from @xmath131 to @xmath132 and @xmath133 and @xmath134 ranging from @xmath135 to @xmath119 .",

    "is still a positive integer , which has to be taken to zero following assumption [ ass : replica ] , in order to be able to expand @xmath103 for small @xmath119 , as in ( [ eq : g_nu_def_expanded ] ) .",
    "however , since the integral in ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) can not be performed exactly , we need to calculate it asymptotically in the limit of large antenna numbers @xmath15,@xmath136 .",
    "therefore we need to interchange the limits @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "@xcite [ ass : interchanging_limits ] the limits @xmath139 and @xmath138 in evaluating @xmath103 in ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) can be interchanged by first taking the former and then the latter without affecting the final answer .",
    "we now use assumption [ ass : interchanging_limits ] to calculate ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) asymptotically for large @xmath15 , @xmath16 , by deforming the integrals in ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) to pass through a saddle point .",
    "more details are given in @xcite .",
    "to specify the structure of the saddle - point solution , i.e. the form of @xmath123 , @xmath122 at the saddle - point , we assume as in @xcite that the relevant saddle - point solution is invariant in @xmath119-dimensional replica space .",
    "however , in our case since @xmath123 , @xmath122 are @xmath140-dimensional matrices , this is not enough to fully characterize the saddle - point .",
    "therefore , we will also assume that the saddle - point values of @xmath123 , @xmath122 are invariant in @xmath55-dimensional frequency @xmath141-space .",
    "this assumption , as we shall see , leads to a saddle - point value of @xmath142 , and to an ergodic average of the mutual information , that is independent of inter - frequency correlations , in agreement with the correct answer , as discussed in section [ sec : statistics of mutual information ] and @xcite .",
    "thus , at the saddle - point @xmath123 , @xmath122 take the form @xmath143 , @xmath144 , where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are positive , still undetermined numbers of order unity in the number of antennas .",
    "a scaling factor of @xmath147 has been included for convenience , as will become evident below .",
    "following @xcite we analyze the integral in ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) by shifting the origin of integration to the saddle point , i.e. by rewriting @xmath22 , @xmath23 as @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 are @xmath140-dimensional matrices representing deviations around the saddle point .",
    "one can then expand @xmath142 in ( [ eq : s_full ] ) in a taylor series of increasing powers of @xmath149 , @xmath150 as follows @xmath151 with @xmath152 containing @xmath59-th order terms in @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "these terms are shown explicitly in appendix [ app : details for saddle point analysis of gnu_s ] in ( [ eq : saddle0 ] ) , ( [ eq : s1_expanded ] ) , ( [ eq : s2_expanded ] ) , ( [ eq : s_p_greater2 ] ) , where it can be seen that @xmath152 is @xmath153 , making ( [ eq : expansion_s ] ) indeed an asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of @xmath0 .",
    "the saddle point solution of ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) and hence the corresponding values of @xmath145 , @xmath146 is found by demanding that @xmath142 is stationary with respect to variations in @xmath123 , @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite this means that @xmath154 ( see ( [ eq : s1_expanded ] ) ) , which is analogous to setting the first derivative of a function to zero , in order to find its maximum or minimum .",

    "fortunately , @xmath159 is quadratic in the variables @xmath149 and @xmath150 so that the integral ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) is just a gaussian integral at this order .",
    "in contrast , @xmath152 terms with @xmath160 become vanishingly small at large @xmath0 , since they are @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , they can be expanded from the exponent in ( [ eq : gnu_s ] ) and treated perturbatively as follows : @xmath161 each term in this expansion can be evaluated explicitly , with higher order terms producing corrections of increasingly higher orders in @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently , taking the logarithm of the result as prescribed in ( [ eq : logg_nuexpansion ] ) will produce an @xmath1-expansion for the cumulant moments of @xmath101 , with only integer powers of @xmath1 surviving @xcite ) .      from ( [ eq : saddle0 ] ) in appendix [ app : details for saddle point analysis of gnu_s ] we see that @xmath162 with proportionality factor @xmath163 being the leading term to the mutual information , which is given by @xmath164 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 are given by ( [ eq : t_gen_case ] ) , ( [ eq : r_gen_case ] ) , ( [ eq : t_tilde ] ) , ( [ eq : r_tilde ] ) .    note that the above equations are independent of the relative delays between paths , thereby applying to narrowband channels , as well as wideband channels with non - trivial delays between paths .",

    "<S> these channels include multi - tap delay paths , as well as general channels with covariance matrices that can not be written as a kronecker product , such as dual - polarized antenna arrays with general correlations at both transmitter and receiver ends . </S>",
    "<S> the mathematical methods are formally valid for large antenna numbers , in which limit it is shown that all higher cumulant moments of the distribution , other than the first two scale to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is confirmed that the distribution of the mutual information tends to a gaussian , which enables one to calculate the outage capacity . </S>",
