    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements have now established the sound horizon and horizon at matter - radiation equality as standard rulers for cosmology .",

    "high-@xmath2 surveys would provide important consistency checks with the high-@xmath2 cmb and the hubble parameter determinations as well as limit any residual dark energy component at those epochs . however , given the cmb determination , the most important regime to probe is at moderate to low redshift , since this provides the largest lever  arm in distance .",

    "the acoustic rings become even more important if the @xmath18 template is not well determined by the cmb . weakening the prior constraints on the template parameters @xmath159 to the current level ( which may also be viewed as a rough proxy for future uncertainties due to massive neutrinos , scale - dependent bias and running of the tilt @xcite ) causes a degradation of a factor of @xmath160 for the lrg galaxies in the presence of the acoustic rings but a factor of 2.2 in their absence .",
    "the acoustic rings therefore help make this geometric test robust to uncertainties in the power spectrum template .",
    "the extent to which the information in the acoustic rings can be recovered with broad windows from a non - contiguous region of sky is beyond the scope of the mode counting approximation used here .",

    "<S> we find that a sample similar to that of the ongoing sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) survey can achieve statistical errors at the @xmath6 level for @xmath1 and @xmath0 in several redshift bins . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , implies errors of @xmath7 for a constant dark energy equation of state in a flat universe . </S>",
    "<S> deep galaxy cluster surveys such as the planned south pole telescope ( spt ) survey , can extend this test out to @xmath8 or as far as redshift followup is available . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the expected constraints are at the @xmath9 level , comparable to galaxies and complementary in redshift coverage . </S>"
