    "optical communication using visible light , infrared , or ultraviolet are promising candidates to provide high - speed indoor / outdoor wireless access on non - regulated frequency bands @xcite . unlike the radio frequency communication ( rfc ) systems ,",
    "the light intensity is controlled to convey information in optical communications .",
    "the baseband signals are required to be positive and real , which impose some constraints on applying existing radio - frequency modulation schemes , such as the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) . among plenty of schemes proposed for optical ofdm ( o - ofdm ) , the asymmetrically - clipped optical ofdm ( aco - ofdm ) and dc - biased optical ofdm ( dco - ofdm ) proposed by j. armstrong etc .",
    "are the most popular @xcite .",
    "however , the aco - ofdm scheme suffers from reduced spectral efficiency since only 1/4 of the subcarriers carry information , and the dco - ofdm scheme suffers from low power efficiency due to use of a large dc - bias to compensate for the negative peak .",
    "significant efforts have been made to improve the aco - ofdm and dco - ofdm , such as bit - loading , adaptive modulation methods , etc  @xcite .",
    "however , one common issue is the employment of a non - informative dc - bias ( for dco - ofdm ) , which is subtracted before demodulation at the receiver - side .",
    "it reduces the system power efficiency significantly .",
    "therefore , we propose to use the dc - bias as one dimension of information basis , and design a joint constellation across multiple subcarriers before the ifft .",
    "such scheme is termed dc - informative optical ofdm ( dcio - ofdm ) .",
    "note that our constellation points are sphere - packed in high dimensional space , which shows a more compact structure than lower dimensional counterparts , e.g. when independent @xmath0 ( @xmath1-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ) is applied for each subcarrier .",
    "it is worth noting that either full or partial dc - bias can be utilized as information basis with dcio - ofdm , termed full dcio - ofdm and partial dcio - ofdm , respectively .",
    "the system power gain is expected to grow with the ratio of the informative dc power over the total dc power .",
    "specifically , adopting partial dcio - ofdm indicates a hybrid scheme between dcio - ofdm and dco - ofdm .",
    "the system designers can choose an optimal informative dc power ratio according to the desired system configurations .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organized as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we show the system diagram of the traditional dco - ofdm and the proposed dcio - ofdm . in section iii",
    ", we formulate a convex optimization problem to optimize the constellation for dcio - ofdm that minimizes system error rate .",
    "numerical results are provided in section  iv .",
    "finally , section v concludes this paper .",
    "consider the block diagrams of im / dd based dco - ofdm and dcio - ofdm schemes , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the transmitter ( tx ) can be light - emitting diodes ( led ) or lasers within a broad optical spectrum depending on application scenario .",
    "the frequency - domain discrete channel model that links input symbols @xmath2 to transmitter ifft to output symbols @xmath3 of receiver fft is given as @xmath4 where @xmath2 is the transmitter - side frequency - domain ( independent ) complex symbols of size @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the length of ifft , @xmath7 is the electrical to optical and @xmath8 is the optical to electrical conversion factors respectively for simplicity in this paper without loss of generality .",

    "the matrix @xmath13 is an @xmath10 dft matrix with elements @xmath14 , which is unitary and thus multiplying @xmath13 with @xmath12 does not change the statistics of @xmath12 .",

    "assume that the constellation is jointly designed across only part of the sub - carrier .",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of independent sub - carriers other than the @xmath28 subcarrier , that are jointly designed with the @xmath28 subcarrier .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is set to be zero .",
    "note that , due to the conjugate symmetry of the dco - ofdm symbols before the ifft , the number of subcarriers involved into the joint design is @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the number of joint constellation points .",
    "note that , for a full dcio - ofdm , all independent subcarriers are jointly designed , i.e. , @xmath32 ; and for a partial dcio - ofdm , some independent subcarriers are designed jointly and others are designed independently , i.e. , @xmath33 . for a full dcio - ofdm , there is no `` bias adding '' operation , since with properly designed constellation symbols , the output of ifft @xmath34 is ensured to be non - negative .",
    "additional features of the proposed scheme include :    * mapping / de - mapping are done based on the binary switching algorithm ( bsa ) that minimizes the number of bits in error with one symbol error @xcite ; * no signal clipping is needed as long as ( convex ) dynamic range constraints are imposed on @xmath34 with the design .      note that , for dco - ofdm , an equivalent scheme is feasible by setting @xmath35 and adding no dc after da , as long as @xmath36 is estimated before ifft instead of being measured after da .",
    "this motivates us to wonder how the @xmath37-th subcarrier can be better utilized , e.g. to be made adaptive to carry information bits .",
    "we propose a joint mapping scheme instead , and the combined information bit sequences of length @xmath38 are jointly mapped to a _",

    "assume the same power @xmath88 for all @xmath89 independent subcarriers .",
