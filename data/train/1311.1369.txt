    "these previous results indicate that the disturbances in the central engine are likely propagated outwards along the jets .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dips in the x - ray emission are well correlated with the ejections of bright superluminal knots in the radio jets of 3c 120 @xcite and 3c 111 @xcite .",
    "the outbursts are physically linked to the ejections of superluminal knots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then these outbursts of broad - line and jet emission might respond to the stronger disturbances in the central engine .",
    "it is expected that there might be correlations with time lags between variations of broad - line and jet emission .",
    "a method was proposed to connect the time lags , the size of broad - line region ( blr ) , and the location of jet emission for blazar 3c 273 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the blrs are important to gamma - ray emission in blazars .",
    "the gamma rays from blazars are generally believed to be from a relativistic jet with a small viewing angle @xcite .",
    "the diffuse radiation field of blr could have a strong impact on the expected external compton ( ec ) spectrum of the most powerful blazars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this strong impact rises from two factors .",
    "one of them is the seed photons from the blr in the inverse compton scattering , and the seed photons significantly influence the ec spectrum .",
    "the other is photon - photon absorption between the seed photons and the gamma - ray photons of the ec spectrum .",
    "there is a underlying physical factor that constrains how much the above two factors influence on the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "the underlying factor is the location of gamma - ray  emitting region relative to the blr .",
    "if the gamma - ray  emitting region is inside the blr , the gamma - ray spectrum will shift to higher energies and the gamma - ray luminosity will become larger due to the relativistic effects . at the same time , the photon - photon absorption becomes more significant as the emitting region goes deeper into the blr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the emitting region is outside the blr , the gamma - ray spectrum will shift to lower energies and the gamma - ray luminosity will become lower due to the relativistic effects . at the same time , the photon - photon absorption becomes insignificant as the emitting region keeps away from the blr .",
    "thus it is valuable to connect the blr size with the location of jet emission",
    ". it will be an important step for this connection to confirm correlation between variations of broad - lines and radio emission of jet and to estimate the relevant time lags . in the paper , we study this issue in the broad - line radio galaxy 3c 120 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents method .",
    "section 3 presents application to 3c 120 .",
    "section 3 contains three subsections : subsection 3.1 presents constraint on time lag , subsection 3.2 data of 3c 120 , and subsection 3.3 analysis of time lag .",
    "section 4 is for discussion and conclusions . in this work ,",
    "we assume the standard @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 0.27 , and @xmath6= 0.73 .",
    "according to equation ( 7 ) in paper i , we have a relation between @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath7 is the size of the blr , @xmath8 is the radio - emitting location of the jet , @xmath11 is the speed of light , @xmath12 is the travelling speed of disturbances down the jet , equivalent to the bulk velocity of jet @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the viewing angle of the jet axis to the line of sight , and @xmath15 is the measured time lag of the radio emission relative to the broad lines . from the velocity @xmath16 and the viewing angle @xmath14 , we have the apparent speed @xmath17 , which gives @xmath18 . substituting this expression of @xmath0 for the velocity term in equation ( 1 )",
    ", we have @xmath19 from equation ( 2 ) , we have an expression to estimate @xmath20 @xmath21",
    "3c 120 , at redshfit @xmath22 , has the one - sided jet with the apparent superluminal motion in the approaching jet @xcite .",
    "the central supermassive black hole of this object has a mass of a few times @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the very long baseline array ( vlba ) imaging observations revealed a very complex radio jet in 3c 120 , such as superluminal components , stationary components , and trailing components in inner jet @xcite .",
    "there are two stationary features in the radio jet , d and s1 @xcite .",
    "the feature d is located at the base of the jet , and could be the core of the jet .",
    "the feature s1 is most likely a standing shock formed in the jet . as the moving knots pass through the stationary feature s1",
    ", these knots will produce outbursts .",
    "the process was tested in the optical light curves of 3c 120 with peaks corresponding to the moving component passages through s1 .",
    "it is not possible to verify whether the radio flux density reacted to the passage of moving features in the same fashion as the optical continuum .",
    "the prominent superluminal feature o reaches it maximum flux density around 0.5 mas from the radio core @xcite .",
    "the stationary feature s1 was identified at @xmath2 0.7 mas separated from the vlba 43 ghz core @xcite .",
    "thus the radio outbursts may originate in the region from d to s1 in the inner jet .    for 3c 120",
    ", @xcite derived a distance of @xmath2 0.5 pc from the corona to the vlba 43 ghz core region using the average time delay between the start of the x - ray dips and the time of ejection of the corresponding superluminal knots . for 3c 111 ,",
    "a distance of @xmath2 0.6 pc from the corona is estimated with the same method as in 3c 120 @xcite .",
    "the 43 ghz vlba observations give the global parameters of the jet for 3c 120 , such as @xmath24@xcite .",
    "these global parameters are widely accepted by other researches .",
    "the 15 ghz components may correspond to the strongest events in the central engine @xcite . due to the optical depth",
    ", the 15 ghz outburst may follow the 43 ghz outburst .",
    "the emitting location of the 15 ghz outburst is estimated as the sum of the distance of 0.5 pc from the corona to the vlba core and the de - projected distance of 0.00.7 mas from the vlba core . under the standard @xmath3cdm cosmology we considered ,",
    "an angular separation of 1 mas in the sky corresponds to a projected linear distance of 0.66 pc .",
    "the de - projected distance of 0.7 mas from the radio core is equal to 0.7@xmath250.66 pc/@xmath26=0.7@xmath250.66 pc/@xmath27=1.32 pc .",
    "the distance of 15 ghz outburst emitting region from the central engine is @xmath280.5 pc0.5 pc+1.32 pc=0.51.82",
    "pc=1.635.93 ly . for 3c 120 , the h@xmath0 line has a blr size of @xmath29 light - days , i.e. @xmath30 ly @xcite . the apparent speeds of the moving components with well - determined motions are all within a range of @xmath31 @xcite . based on equation ( 3 ) , @xmath32 ly , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath8=1.635.93 ly , we derive @xmath35 .",
    "this positive time lag means that the broad - line variations lead the radio variations .",
    "we make use of the 15 ghz light curve with a higher sampling rate of 59 times per year .",
    "this radio light curve is published in @xcite . for the h@xmath0 line",
    ", @xcite presents a light curve with a very dense sampling of 20 times per month , and also @xcite presents a light curve of sampling 20 times per month in the reverberation mapping observations .",
    "these light curves are presented in figure 1 , and are used to analyze the cross - correlation between them .",
    "the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is used to analyze time lags characterized by the centroid of the zdcf .",
    "the zdcf method is straightforward to determine whether there is a time lag between different light curves , and firstly it is applied to analyze the time lags .",
    "the centroid time lag @xmath36 is computed by all the points with correlation coefficients not less than 0.8 times the maximum of correlation coefficients in the zdcf bumps closer to the zero - lag .",
    "the uncertainties of each point in the zdcfs only take into account the uncertainties from the measurements by monte carlo simulation , and the uncertainties of time lags are underestimated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "thus we use the model - independent flux randomization / random subset selection ( fr / rss ) monte carlo method @xcite to re - estimate the time lags and their uncertainties in the cross - correlation results .",
    "the fr / rss method is based on the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) method @xcite for the sparsely sampled light curves , and on the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ) method for the densely sampled light curves .",
    "the h@xmath0 line light curves with a very dense sampling are published in 2012 @xcite .",
    "3c 120 is densely observed from 2008.0 to 2012.5 in the 15 ghz radio monitoring program with the 40 m telescope at the owens valley radio observatory @xcite .",
    "firstly , it is obvious that the h@xmath0 line light curve in @xcite can be well matched with the outburst in the 15 ghz light curve from 2011.0 to 2011.3 as the line light curve is moved right by 0.32 yr ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "the zdcf method and the fr / rss method are performed to investigate the correlation between these h@xmath0 line light curves and the 15 ghz light curve , and estimate the time lags from the correlation .",
    "as these two line light curves are combined into one light curve , the calculated zdcf is presented in figure 2a .",
    "the horizontal and vertical error bars in figure 2a represent the 68.3 per cent confidence intervals in the time lags and the relevant correlation coefficients , respectively .",
    "there are positive and negative correlations ( see figure 2a ) .",
    "the positive correlation has a time lag around 0.3 yr .",
    "the h@xmath0 line variations lead the 15 ghz variations by a factor of @xmath2 0.3 yr .",
    "this lag has the same sign as that lag estimated in section 3.1 .",
    "this indicates that the positive correlation is reliable . for the positive correlation",
    ", the zdcf method gives @xmath37 yr . the fr / rss method gives @xmath38 yr with a mean of peak correlation coefficients @xmath39 in monte carlo simulations of 10,000 runs ( see figure 2b ) .",
    "this time lag is well consistent with that lag derived from the zdcf method .",
    "the 15 ghz light curve shows a simple baseline superimposed with some outbursts and flares ( see figure 3a ) .",
    "this baseline should influence the cross - correlation function between this radio light curve and the h@xmath0 line light curve .",
    "thus we subtract this baseline assumed as a simple gaussian profile from the 15 ghz light curve .",
    "it is obvious that the simple gaussian profile can well account for the underlying baseline in the 15 ghz light curve ( see figure 3a ) .",
    "the cross - correlation function between the residual radio light curve and the h@xmath0 line light curve is calculated with the zdcf method and the fr / rss method .",
    "the calculated zdcf is presented in figure 3b . the positive cross - correlation around 0.3",
    "yr is re - confirmed , and the significance of cross - correlation is significantly improved with this residual light curve .",
    "the zdcf method gives @xmath40 yr . the fr / rss method gives @xmath41 yr with a mean of peak correlation coefficients @xmath42 in monte carlo simulations of 10,000 runs ( see figure 3c ) .",
    "this time lag is in excellent agreement with that lag derived from the zdcf method .",
    "the broad h@xmath0 line variations lead the 15 ghz variations .",
    "hereafter , @xmath36 is equivalent to @xmath9 .",
    "we simplify the ionizing continuum region to be a point .",
    "this simplification indicates that the disturbances will simultaneously be transported outwards with the ionizing continuum and the relativistic jet , i.e. it makes equations ( 1)(3 ) to be valid .",
    "this simplification will influence the time lag @xmath9 .",
    "the disturbances in the accretion disk will take a certain time to travel between their location of origin and the event horizon of the central black hole .",
    "then the disturbances will take some time to pass through the ionizing continuum region to the event horizon . for 3c 120 ,",
    "the uv ionizing continuum region is located at @xmath2 5@xmath43 from the black hole , where @xmath44 is the gravitational radius of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass is on the order of @xmath23 @xcite , and the size of @xmath2 5@xmath43 is on the order of @xmath45 ly .",
    "if the disturbances are a thermal fluctuation propagating inward , it should have an effective speed @xmath46 @xcite , to cause a time delay of @xmath47 yr for the distance of @xmath2 5@xmath43 .",
    "this time delay should be negligible compared with the time lag @xmath48 yr .",
    "in estimation of the magnitude of @xmath9 in section 3.1 , we use the distance of @xmath2 0.5 pc from the vlba 43 ghz core region to the corona in the accretion disk - corona system , and ignore the size of corona .",
    "the size of corona may influence @xmath9 .",
    "the coronal radius is @xmath2 40@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the jet velocity near the central engine will be @xmath2 0.9c ( see paper i ) , and this radius of @xmath2 40@xmath43 will cause a time delay on the order of @xmath49 yr .",
    "the time delay is negligible .    from equation",
    "( 2 ) , we have an expression to estimate @xmath8 from @xmath50 , @xmath14 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 @xmath51 for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath30 ly , and @xmath54 yr , we have @xmath55 ly from monte carlo simulations based on equation ( 4 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath56 for 3c 120 . @xmath57-large area telescope ( lat ) detected gamma rays from 3c 120 @xcite , and it was suggested that the gev emission of broad - line radio galaxies is most likely dominated by the beamed radiation of relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles .",
    "the radio and gamma - ray emitting regions are closely connected with each other , and there is @xmath58 between the radio - emitting position @xmath8 and the gamma - ray  emitting location @xmath59 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is unclear for 3c 120 that @xmath60 or @xmath61 , which will significantly influence the gamma - ray spectrum produced in the ec processes .",
    "the locations of gamma - ray  emitting regions relative to the blrs are still an open and controversial issue in the researches on blazars .",
    "there are three options for the issue .",
    "the first option is that @xmath60 for the powerful blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the third option is that the same source can display both behaviors .",
    "that is , most of the time the dissipation region is inside the blr , but there could be some epochs when the gamma - ray  emitting region drift outside the blr .",
    "the very first idea was advanced in @xcite , and a very clear case with multi - wavelength coverage was recently found by @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray light curves and the corresponding broad - line light curves should shed light on this issue .",
    "the chosen parameters are average for the jet , and do not correspond to any of the components identified in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the jet components will have different orientations and different velocities .",
    "this seems to be an issue for the choice of jet parameters in equations ( 1)(4 ) .",
    "the reverberation mapping model assumes the linear response of broad emission lines to ionizing continuum .",
    "in fact , the line response is not linear .",
    "it is most likely that the line and radio emission respond nonlinearly to the events in the central engine .",
    "thus some weaker events in the central engine might not produce the correlative responses in the radio and broad - line variations .",
    "both radio and broad - line emission may have good responses to the strongest events in the central engine , and their relevant outbursts should have good matching . there is a matching between these outbursts in the h@xmath0 line and 15 ghz light curves sampled densely .",
    "however , the overall complexity of the light curves and the jet structure at radio bands may lead to difficulties of cross - identifying individual events in different bands .",
    "thus it is difficult to identify the radio knots and radio outbursts corresponding to the broad - line outbursts .",
    "we investigated the correlation and time lag between the radio and broad - line light curves by comparing their profiles and cross - correlating them .",
    "the 15 ghz light curve is observed with the 40 m telescope at the owens valley radio observatory .",
    "the 40 m telescope can not resolve the inner jet on the pc scales .",
    "then the 15 ghz fluxes contain all the emission from the inner jet .",
    "it is difficult to identify the component responsible for the 15 ghz outburst .",
    "it is not possible to determine the relevant velocities of this component along the jet from the central engine to the emitting site of outburst .",
    "thus the average velocity of primary components rather than trailing features will be a good proxy of the global velocity of component emitting outburst .",
    "the viewing angle is the same case as the velocity .",
    "the similar choice is accepted for the jet parameters for 3c 273 ( see paper i ) .",
    "there are positive and negative time lags between radio variations and those of broad - lines h@xmath63 , h@xmath0 , and h@xmath64 due to the relative short coverage of these line light curves in 3c 273 .",
    "the longer ultraviolet line light curves show that these broad - line variations lag the radio variations ( see paper ii ) .",
    "thus the broad - line variations lag the radio variations .",
    "a constraint of @xmath65 0.402.62 pc is set by these negative time lags ( see paper i ) .",
    "the gamma - ray flares detected with @xmath57-lat set a limit of @xmath66 1.6 pc for 3c 273 @xcite .",
    "the limit is marginally consistent with that constraint of @xmath65 0.402.62 pc .",
    "the acceptance of the average parameters of inner jet is reasonable .    in this paper",
    ", we find correlation between the broad - line and radio variations with the zdcf method and the fr / rss method , and determine a positive lag for the broad - line radio galaxy 3c 120 .",
    "the positive lag means that the 15 ghz variations lag the h@xmath0 line variations .",
    "we derive @xmath67 yr from the fr / rss method .",
    "this time lag is consistent with that estimated from the zdcf method .",
    "monte carlo simulations give the radio - emitting location @xmath68 ly from this time lag , the average parameters of inner jet , and equation ( 4 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to use the average parameters of inner jet in equations ( 1)(4 ) .",
    "this reasonability is supported by the marginal agreement of our previous constraint of @xmath65 0.402.62 pc with the limit of @xmath66 1.6 pc from @xmath69-lat observations of gamma - ray flares in 3c 273 .",
    "the underlying baseline of 15 ghz light curve significantly influences the correlation between broad h@xmath0 line and 15 ghz variations .",
    "the subtraction of this baseline from the 15 ghz light curve can well improve the correlation .",
    "the longer h@xmath0 line light curve well sampled may test the correlation .",
