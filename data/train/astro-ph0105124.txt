    "the last decade has seen dramatic advances in our ability to compile large samples of quasars according to well  defined quantitative criteria ( e.g. stocke et al .",
    "1991 , schneider , schmidt and gunn 1994 , hewett , foltz and chaffee 1995 ) .",
    "however , progress in addressing a number of longstanding questions concerning the statistical properties of the quasar population continues to be limited by the possibility that unquantified selection effects bias the intrinsic distribution of properties inferred from the observations .",
    "a particularly important recent advance for studies of the quasar population has come about through the availability of the first radio survey ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "the combination of the faint limiting flux density , @xmath10mjy , at @xmath11mhz , high  precision astrometry and extensive sky coverage has enabled a well  defined sample of @xmath12 optically bright quasars detected at radio wavelengths to be compiled for the first time ( white et al . 2000 ) .",
    "initial investigations have revealed the presence of some broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars in the first sample ( becker et al .",
    "2000 ) , apparently contradicting one of the few established differences between the properties of quasars detected at radio wavelengths and those of the quasar population as a whole ( stocke et al . 1992 ) .",
    "quantitative comparison of the spectral energy distributions and the evolutionary behaviour of the first ",
    "quasars to results derived from optically  selected samples of bright quasars , such as the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) , offer the prospect of better understanding issues such as the nature of bals and the physical origin of the very broad spread of radio to optical luminosity exhibited within the quasar population .",
    "however , concern still exists that the presence of unrecognised selection effects in optical samples ( e.g. white et al .",
    "2000 ;  5.3 ) will preclude a rigorous intercomparison .",
    "the recent extension of the first radio survey to areas of sky on the celestial equator provides an overlap with approximately half the area covered by the lbqs , the largest published survey of apparently bright optically  selected quasars .",
    "it is possible therefore to perform a direct empirical comparison of the two . in this paper",
    "we present a spectroscopic investigation of the optical sources that both fall within the lbqs flux  limits and coincide with radio sources in the first catalogue over an area of @xmath13deg@xmath0 .",
    "section 2 contains a brief overview of the main properties of the lbqs and the first surveys together with the results of the cross  correlation of the first source catalogue with the flux  limited optical catalogue that forms the basis for the lbqs quasar search .",
    "section 3 presents the results of spectroscopic follow  up of those first sources that pair to optical sources and which had not previously been investigated as part of the lbqs .",
    "the census of new objects identified during the spectroscopic program that satisfy the lbqs redshift and flux limits is presented in  4 .",
    "the properties of the new quasars and an assessment of the effectiveness of the lbqs are discussed in  5 .",
    "a discussion of the implications of the results of the lbqs ",
    "first comparison for understanding the apparent differences in the statistical properties of the lbqs and the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) ( white et al .",
    "2000 ) is presented in  6 , prior to a summary of the main conclusions of the investigation given in  7 .",
    "the lbqs is the largest published survey of optically selected quasars at bright , @xmath14 , apparent magnitudes .",
    "a full description of the survey is given in hewett , foltz and chaffee ( 1995 ; paper vi ) along with positions , magnitudes and redshifts for 1055 quasars in an effective area of @xmath15deg@xmath0 over a total area of @xmath16deg@xmath0 of sky .",
    "the source material for the survey consisted of automated plate measuring ( apm ) machine scans of united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) direct and objective  prism plates .",
    "the application of a number of search algorithms to the low  resolution , objective  prism spectra of objects in the flux  limited catalogue resulted in the detection of quasars over an extended redshift range , @xmath17 , that possess a broad range of spectral energy distributions .",
    "aspects of the effectiveness of the lbqs are discussed in  5.4 of paper vi , where it is concluded that , for objects satisfying the broad  band flux limits for inclusion in the survey , no known class of quasar spectral energy distribution would escape detection . however , a significant number of candidate objects remain unobserved , and it is estimated that the survey contains @xmath18 of the total number of quasars satisfying the broad  band flux limits .",
    "attention is also drawn to the likely systematic incompleteness in the survey for quasars with redshifts @xmath19 , where the form of the typical quasar spectral energy distribution results in a relatively red objective  prism spectrum lacking particularly strong emission lines or continuum breaks .    since the publication of paper vi",
    ", observations of further candidate objects have resulted in the identification of a small number of additional quasars .",
    "similarly , observations by other workers of a small number of objects among the unobserved lbqs candidates have produced additional quasars .",
    "the latter group include several objects discussed in paper vi that were not included in the lbqs catalogue due to book  keeping errors and one erroneous classification resulting from a `` private communication '' .",
    "table 1 provides coordinates , apparent magnitudes and redshifts of 12 objects that should thus be included with the objects from table 4 of paper vi in any analysis of the lbqs quasar catalogue .",
    "optical spectra of 9 of the objects in table 1 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the extended sample of 1067 quasars , together with the 8 `` unknown '' objects of table 6 of paper vi , which are potential bl lacs , form the basis of the comparison with the first survey described in this paper , although the results and conclusions are essentially identical if the original catalogue of 1055 quasars from paper vi is employed .",
    "the published celestial coordinates of lbqs quasars are accurate to @xmath20arcsec in each ordinate . a significant contribution to",
    "the uncertainty arises from the difficulty in defining the celestial reference frame to which the apm  measured x  y centroids of objects on the photographic plates may be tied .",
    "the coordinates published in paper vi are based on a reference frame defined by the grid of several hundred ppm ( roser and bastian 1988 ) stars within each ukst field .",
    "a significant improvement over the frame defined using the ppm stars is now possible through the use of the larger number of stars to fainter magnitudes that are included in the tycho2 catalogue ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) . employing the celestial coordinates and proper motions of the @xmath21 tycho2 stars within each lbqs ukst field",
    ", j2000.0 positions have been rederived for all sources in the apm flux  limited catalogues from which the lbqs quasars were identified .",
    "the resulting positions show greatly reduced systematic errors as a function of position on the plates . the root ",
    "mean  square positional differences between the catalogued tycho2 star postions and the apm ",
    "positions is typically @xmath22arcsec . in practice ,",
    "the presence of factors such as nearby fainter images and a variety of emulsion / plate flaws mean that a significant number of `` outliers '' exist when pairing a large catalogue of apm sources to a reference catalogue , such as first , so a matching radius of @xmath23arcsec is appropriate ( see  2.3 ) .      the instigation of the first radio survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) , reaching a faint limiting flux density , @xmath10mjy , at @xmath11mhz , coupled with the sky coverage of thousands of square degrees , has enabled a number of observational investigations not hitherto possible to be undertaken . in particular , the survey sources include many quasars , not just the small fraction of the population detectable in radio surveys with much higher limiting flux densities . given the very accurate celestial positions ( @xmath24arcsec ) of the first sources ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) , identifying a large well  defined sample of optically bright quasars detected at radio wavelengths comparable in size to the largest existing samples of bright , optically ",
    "selected quasars has at last proved viable ( white et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the availability , in mid1999 , of the first survey catalogue over a substantial area of sky in a strip at @xmath25 declination provides a significant overlap in sky coverage with the lbqs .",
    "the first catalogue used in this paper is that available at 1999 july 21 containing @xmath26 sources from first observations made over the period 19931998 .",
    "the sky coverage includes an area of @xmath13deg@xmath0 coincident with the survey area of the lbqs , and includes 566 lbqs quasars and 4 lbqs `` unknowns '' .",
    "an empirical verification of the appropriate radius to employ for matching the lbqs and first catalogues was made using the existing lbqs quasars and unknown objects .",
    "of the 570 lbqs quasars and unknowns within the area of the first catalogue , 72 lbqs sources possess one or more first sources within a @xmath27arcsec radius .",
    "sixty  seven of these have a smallest optical to radio source separations of @xmath28arcsec . the large number of optical  radio coincidences within @xmath29arcsec accords with expectations based on the astrometric accuracy of the catalogues .",
    "the predicted number of such chance coincidences is @xmath30 and all 67 associations almost certainly reflect physical association .",
    "in addition , 2 lbqs quasars ( b1012 + 0213 , b1313 - 0142 ) lie along lines joining two catalogued first sources but the closest optical to radio source separation is @xmath31arcsec .",
    "one lbqs source ( b1319 + 0039 ) is separated by @xmath32arcsec from a first source and the quasar lies along a line joining the catalogued first source to a second first source , too faint to be included in the first source catalogue but clearly visible in the first image cutout and almost coincident with the quasar .",
    "all three of these lbqs quasars are virtually certain to be associated with the multiple first sources . the predicted number of chance lbqs ",
    "first coincidences within a @xmath27arcsec radius is @xmath33 .",
    "two further lbqs quasars ( b1138 - 0126 and b2359 - 0216b ) have single catalogued first sources with separations between @xmath34 and @xmath27arcsec and they most likely reflect chance superpositions .",
    "no further discussion of these two objects is included in the paper .",
    "table 2 includes details of the lbqs  first source matches .",
    "column 1 , lbqs name , derived from the b1950.0 coordinates ; columns 23 , the j2000.0 right ascension and declination for the lbqs objects derived from the ukst plates ; column 4 , redshift ; column 5 , @xmath35 magnitude ; column 6 ; first source associated with the lbqs object ; column 7 , integrated radio flux from the first catalogue ; column 8 , associated rms uncertainty in the first maps at the source position ; column 9 , angular separation between the lbqs and first sources ; column 10 , @xmath36 the @xmath37corrected ratio of radio to optical flux for each optical  radio association .",
    "for completeness , the three lbqs sources with optical  radio separations @xmath31arcsec , denoted by `` n '' in column 11 , are listed in table 2 but these objects are not included in the assessment of the lbqs  first match statistics .",
    "the values of @xmath38 , the @xmath37corrected ratio of radio to optical flux for each optical  radio association , employed herein have been calculated according to the definition of stocke et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . to facilitate comparison with the results of the first quasar survey the same values for the assumed power ",
    "law spectral energy distributions , @xmath39 , in the radio and optical , @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , have been adopted as in white et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in calculating @xmath38 white et al .",
    "employ the photographic @xmath42 magnitude as a direct estimate of the conventional @xmath43 magnitude employed in the definition .",
    "it is possible to make a series of quite complicated corrections to obtain an estimate of the quasar continuum flux at @xmath44  from the @xmath35 magnitudes ( hooper et al .",
    "1995 ;  2.3 ) .",
    "however , over the redshift range @xmath17 applicable to this investigation , the mean @xmath45 for a typical quasar is @xmath46 , which results in an increase of only @xmath47 in @xmath38 .",
    "thus , differences in @xmath38 due to bandpass effects are in general very small and the uncertainty in the individual values of @xmath38 are dominated by possible intrinsic variability over the @xmath48year epoch difference between the acquisition of the radio and optical fluxes and the errors in the radio and optical fluxes .",
    "given these circumstances the raw @xmath35 magnitudes have been adopted as a direct estimate of @xmath43 magnitude .",
    "based on the predicted accuracy of the celestial positions of both catalogues , together with the empirical verification provided by the cross  correlation of the known lbqs quasar positions with the first catalogue , a pairing radius of @xmath49arcsec was adopted as the criterion for a match between an optical and first source .",
    "there are @xmath50 first sources in the @xmath13deg@xmath0 of overlap with the lbqs catalogue . the lbqs flux  limited input catalogue contains @xmath51 stellar images and @xmath52 non  stellar images in the region of overlap and the predicted number of chance coincidences between first sources and lbqs stellar and non  stellar sources are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "the cross  correlation of the two catalogues produces a total of @xmath55 matches within the @xmath49arcsec pairing radius . of these ,",
    "@xmath56 are classified as stellar by the apm and @xmath57 non  stellar .",
    "the nature of the objective  prism plate material employed to compile the lbqs catalogue is such that a fraction of the flux ",
    "limited object catalogue defined from the apm scans of the ukst direct plates can not be classified reliably .",
    "for example , objects may possess spectra contaminated by spectra of nearby sources .",
    "this straightforward loss of objects is responsible for the reduced effective area of the survey relative to the total area of sky surveyed .",
    "for the 11 fields included in the lbqs",
    " first overlap the predicted percentage of stellar and marginally resolved objects not included in the lbqs is @xmath58 ( paper vi ; table 2 ) . of the @xmath56",
    "stellar first  lbqs matches , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are classified as unprocessable , in excellent agreement with the prediction from the effective area calculation .",
    "the fraction of low surface brightness galaxies and significantly resolved galaxies with unprocessable spectra is in fact somewhat higher , although this is not relevant for the lbqs quasar catalogue with its low redshift limit of @xmath61 , and @xmath62 of the @xmath57 non  stellar objects ( @xmath63 ) are classified as unprocessable .",
    "thus , the cross  correlation of the two catalogues produces 83 stellar sources and 380 non ",
    "stellar sources that were searched as part of the lbqs survey and that pair to catalogued first sources . of the 83 stellar sources",
    "64 possess identification spectra obtained as part of the lbqs : 62 quasars and unknowns ( table 2 ) , 1 active galactic nucleus and 1 star .",
    "just 19 stellar objects , of which @xmath53 are expected to be chance coincidences , remain for which identification spectra were not obtained as part of the lbqs .    the large number of non ",
    "stellar matches appears to present a less tractable problem but in fact the majority of the objects can be eliminated as potential quasars from consideration of their image profiles on the ukst plates .",
    "the lbqs survey was designed to be sensitive to quasars with both unresolved and resolved images on the ukst direct plates .",
    "`` resolved quasars '' might include objects at relatively low redshift , where the host galaxy is also visible , as well as gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "the objective  prism spectra of objects , whether resolved or unresolved , satisfying the flux limits on the ukst direct plates were searched as part of the lbqs survey . however , the very tight , monotonic , relation between the peak and integrated brightness of unresolved stellar images on the ukst direct plates means it is possible to define a simple criterion that eliminates a large fraction of the resolved images from consideration . specifically , for a resolved object to contain an unresolved source bright enough to satisfy the lbqs flux limits , the image of the resolved object must contain pixels that achieve a peak brightness at least equivalent to that of an unresolved source at the faint limit of the lbqs flux  limited catalogue ( paper vi : ",
    "the non  stellar sources may thus be divided into two categories , i ) images with a peak surface brightness too faint to include an unresolved source bright enough for inclusion in the lbqs , 222 objects , and ii ) images whose peak surface brightness exceeds that of the faintest unresolved source in the lbqs flux  limited catalogue , 158 objects .",
    "five of the objects in the latter category had been identified as quasars ( table 2 ) and 4 as active ",
    "nuclei during the lbqs , leaving 149 objects for which identification spectra were not obtained as part of the lbqs .",
    "given the small predicted number of chance coincidences the majority of the non  stellar optical ",
    "radio associations likely reflect physical association .",
    "however , the peak surface brightness criterion used in the definition of the sample is extremely conservative .",
    "the vast majority of the `` high surface brightness '' non ",
    "stellar objects possess extended morphologies , consistent with galaxies at low redshift , @xmath64 , and no significant unresolved component exists . a significant fraction of the small number of objects with redshifts that exceed the lbqs low  redshift limit of @xmath61 and that show evidence for active ",
    "galactic nuclei , will also not possess unresolved components bright enough to be included in the lbqs .",
    "the nature of the small number of such non  stellar objects is further discussed in  4 , following a description of the spectroscopic observations of the sources .",
    "spectroscopic observations of 11 stellar and 35 non  stellar candidates were obtained using lris , the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke et al . 1995 ) , on keck i during the night of 2000 april 30 .",
    "a 300 line / millimetre grating , blazed to @xmath65 , and a slit  width of @xmath10arcsec gave a wavelength coverage of @xmath66 at a resolution of @xmath67 .",
    "standard bias and flatfield exposures were obtained at the start of the night and comparison lamp exposures were obtained every few hours to monitor the wavelength stability of the spectrograph .",
    "wavelength stability was determined to be @xmath68 .",
    "the slit was aligned east ",
    "west throughout the observations .",
    "exposures of three spectrophotometric standard stars were obtained in order to place the spectra of the candidate objects on a relative flux scale but no attempt was made to obtain absolute spectrophotometry .",
    "transparancy , which was good , and the seeing of @xmath69arcsec were stable throughout the observations .",
    "exposure times of @xmath70s for the stellar objects predicted to be quasars and @xmath71s for the other objects produced spectra of excellent quality , s / n@xmath72 , and the identifications , based on multiple absorption and emission features , are unambiguous .",
    "redshifts for the extragalactic sources were determined by cross - correlation of the quasar spectra with the lbqs composite spectrum ( francis et al , 1991 ) and by direct measurement of the wavelengths of narrow emission lines , when present , or absorption features for the galaxies .",
    "r. becker and collaborators provided the spectrum of one stellar candidate identified as a quasar during their follow  up program of first sources . in 1999",
    "november they very generously also undertook lris observations on keck i , employing a set  up very similar to that described above , of 6 of the stellar candidates , confirming their identifications as stars ( becker 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "further spectroscopic observations of 1 stellar and 26 non  stellar candidates were obtained with the 6.5 m mmt on the nights of 2000 november 1920 .",
    "the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph was used with a 500 line / millimetre grating , blazed at @xmath73 , and a slit ",
    "width of @xmath74arcsec , giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath75 at a resolution of @xmath76 .",
    "the slit was aligned along a constant azimuth to minimize the effect of atmospheric dispersion .",

    "attention was also drawn to the redshift interval @xmath115 , in which the properties of typical quasar seds produce objective  prism spectra that are relatively red and largely featureless and where the survey was therefore predicted to be less effective than average .",
    "consideration of the nature of the candidate selection algorithms and empirical comparison with surveys and compilations of existing quasars led to the conclusion that only very red , essentially featureless objects , such as red bl lacs , would escape detection .",

    "j1143 + 0113 ( @xmath116 ) , for example , is an extremely blue object that was identified at an early stage of the lbqs but the noise in the only moderate signal  to  noise ratio objective  prism spectrum conspires to produce apparent absorption lines at wavelengths corresponding to h@xmath80 and h@xmath97 , suggesting classification as a hot white dwarf , and the object was therefore not assigned a high priority for spectroscopic follow  up .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the colours of the objects from both tables 2 and 5 , along with colours for all the remaining lbqs quasars , as a function of redshift .",
    "the definition of the colour  measure , the half  power point ( hpp ) of the objective  prism spectra , is described in  3.1.1 of paper vi . in this representation ,",
    "the dashed  line at hpp=0 indicates the boundary below which objects satisfy the basic colour selection criterion for inclusion in the lbqs candidate list .",
    "the substantial spread in colour at fixed redshift is well illustrated by the distribution of the lbqs quasars as a whole .",
    "the systematic variation in the location of the mid  point of the distribution as a function of redshift is directly analogous to the well  established variation in @xmath117 colour as a function of redshift exhibited by quasars .",
    "the extent of the spread in colour does not vary significantly as a function of redshift , although a small fraction of pathological objects does exist .",
    "the conclusion drawn in paper vi regarding the likely reduction of the effectiveness of the lbqs selection in the redshift region about @xmath118 was based on noting that , assuming an essentially constant dispersion in hpp as a function of redshift , a number of the redder quasars at @xmath119 would fail to satisfy the colour selection and in many cases their spectra do not possess other characteristic features that would allow their identification as high  probability candidates .",
    "the confirmation that 4 of the 9 new lbqs ",
    "first objects have redshifts in the range @xmath6 thus accords well with expectations .    the other redshift interval where increased difficulty in identifying quasars is not unexpected",
    "is close to the low ",
    "redshift limit , @xmath61 , of the survey .",
    "redshift cutoff of @xmath61 for the lbqs was chosen with some care .",
    "while the candidate selection algorithms are applied to objects irrespective of morphology , the presence of a significant contribution of stellar light from the host galaxy causes the fainter quasars at @xmath120 to appear increasingly red .",
    "a discussion of the problem in the context of identifying quasars in bright host galaxies , including the results of simulations of quasar+host  galaxy spectra , is contained in hooper et al .",
    "( 1995 ; appendix b ) .",
    "figure 9 of hooper et al . illustrates how rapidly the colour of quasar+host systems moves to the red at @xmath121 .",
    "the restriction of the lbqs survey selection function to nuclear components that satisfy the faint flux limit of the lbqs , combined with the continuity in the amplitude of the spread of hpp as a function of redshift seen in figure 5 , means that it is extremely unlikely that a significant population of quasars at @xmath122 have been excluded from the lbqs .",
    "however , the number of objects in the flux ",
    "limited source catalogue with hpp values close to the selection boundary is large and the detection of 2 new lbqs ",
    "first objects with @xmath123 likely reflects a genuine decrease in the effectiveness of the selection right at the redshift limit .",
    "as is evident from figure 5 , any such effect is confined to @xmath124 as the locus of the hpp distribution moves rapidly blueward , dropping below the hpp=0 line boundary , even by redshift @xmath125 .    in summary , the small number of additional lbqs ",
    "first objects possess gross optical and radio properties entirely consistent with those of the quasars previously identified in the lbqs .",
    "the number and redshift distribution of the additional lbqs ",
    "first objects also accords well with the predictions of the effectiveness of the lbqs selection criteria .",
    "the conclusion that no new population of objects with significantly different properties has eluded the lbqs optical selection is borne out by consideration of the spectra of the 9 lbqs ",
    "first objects shown in figure 3 . in the context of the lbqs survey the spectra are unremarkable both individually and taken together as a sample . for each object , examples of quasars with essentially identical seds at comparable redshifts exist within the lbqs survey .",
    "notwithstanding advances in the application of quantitative techniques to the selection of quasars at optical wavelengths , suggestions that optical surveys suffer from significant biases against the detection of certain types of quasar persist .",
    "for example , in  5.3 of their presentation of the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) , white et al . ( 2000 ) , discuss such a bias in the context of the detection of low  ionization bal qsos .",
    "the surface density of the recently  detected `` radio  loud '' bals among the fbqs quasars is too low for the lbqs ",
    "first match presented in this paper to provide interesting constraints .",
    "however , the essentially complete census of 76 radio  detected objects within the lbqs flux limits presented here demonstrates conclusively that there is no significant bias against any class of quasar , constituting @xmath126 of the first radio  detected population is derived by noting that the detection of no such objects constrains the true incidence of any such population in the survey area to be @xmath127 objects ] . the same constraint applies to any hypothetical bias at particular redshifts or magnitudes , other than the previously reported reduction in the efficiency of the lbqs at @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore , the first ",
    "lbqs comparison offers no support for usher & mitchell s ( 2000 ) contention that the lbqs is unsuitable for the estimate of the quasar luminosity function at low redshifts .",
    "sample limits of redshift @xmath128 and magnitude @xmath129 should be adopted for such statistical analyses ( hewett , foltz & chaffee 1993 , paper vi ) . to facilitate quantitative comparison between the properties of the lbqs catalogue and other surveys",
    "we have adopted a completeness as a function of redshift as tabulated in table 7 .",
    "the numerical values are based on adopting a global incompleteness of @xmath5 with an increase in the loss of objects at redshifts @xmath130 and at the low redshift limit , @xmath61 , of a factor of two .",
    "perhaps most importantly , the results of the lbqs  first comparison offers the prospect of utilising both the lbqs and fbqs , with their very large numbers of quasars , to better understand the physical origin of the very broad range of seds within the quasar population .",
    "the analysis of composite spectra from the two surveys by brotherton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) signals the start of this process .",
    "however , the optical bandpasses employed in the selection of the two samples , @xmath35 ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) for the lbqs and palomar @xmath133 ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) for the fbqs , are significantly different and a careful treatment of the effects of the different bandpasses used to define the optical flux limits is required when interpreting the statistical properties of the quasar samples .",
    "the potential importance of the passband differences is evident from the very different fraction of radio  detected objects found to the respective optical flux limits in the two surveys .",
    "white et al . (",
    "2000 ) suggest that at the brightest optical magnitudes the surface density of optically  detected and radio  detected quasars are essentially identical . even at the faint optical limit of the fbqs , @xmath136 , white et al .",
    "conclude that the radio  detected fraction is @xmath137 . the first ",
    "lbqs comparison in this paper provides a hard upper limit to the fraction of the quasar population with optical magnitudes @xmath138 detected in the first survey .",
    "based on the total of 570 previously  known lbqs quasars and `` unknowns '' within the first survey area and the statistics of the lbqs ",
    "first match ( 67 radio  detected objects among the 570 lbqs quasars and `` unknowns '' and 10 new radio  detected objects ) , the fraction of quasars detected by first is @xmath139 ( i.e. , 77/(570 + 10 ) ) .",
    "an improved estimate is obtained by applying an incompleteness correction to allow for the fraction of quasars not included in the lbqs .",
    "adopting a survey completeness of @xmath140 for the number of lbqs quasars which are not detected in the radio ( i.e. , 503 objects ) , reduces the percentage of radio  detected objects to @xmath8 , very different from the figure of @xmath9 of objects with magnitudes @xmath141 deduced by white et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . dividing the lbqs into magnitude bins containing @xmath142 quasars , table 8 , shows a trend in the same sense as that found by white et al .",
    "but the fraction of radio  detected objects incompleteness in the census of lbqs quasars only detected in the optical , will decrease by @xmath143 is significantly smaller than they find at all magnitudes . for the very brightest lbqs objects , @xmath144 , where the statistics are poor ( 14 quasars , 6 radio  detected , fraction 0.43 ) , the radio  detected surface density approaches half the optical surface density .",
    "so we conclude that only for the optically very brightest quasars , @xmath145 , can white et al.s claim that the radio  detected surface density matches that of optically  selected quasars be true .",
    "the explanation for the large differences in the radio  detected fraction of quasars may be due to a combination of two factors : ( i ) radio  detected quasars possess somewhat redder seds compared to the population as a whole and the @xmath133magnitude limit therefore results in a larger fraction of radio  detected objects compared to the lbqs sample limited by the much bluer @xmath35 passband , ( ii ) the form of the conversion employed by white et al .",

    ", we intend to present a detailed investigation of differences in the seds of sub  samples of quasars from the lbqs and fbqs in a future paper .",
    "however , preliminary indications of the origin of the difference in radio  detected fractions can be drawn using composite spectra for the two samples .",
    "we have used the fbqs composite spectrum derived from 657 fbqs quasars and the lbqs composite employed by brotherton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . observed ",
    "frame spectra over the redshift range @xmath147 were generated using both composites .",
    "these were then transformed to simulate their appearance on the objective  prism plates employed in the lbqs survey .",
    "the procedure is based on an empirical transformation derived from @xmath148 flux  calibrated quasar and stellar spectra and their associated spectra on the objective  prism plates .",
    "the hpp values for the two composite spectra are shown in figure 6 ( solid line ",
    "lbqs composite ; dashed line   fbqs composite ) .",
    "the extremely good match between the centroid of the distribution of hpp values for the individual lbqs quasars and the synthetic locus of the lbqs composite is evident .",
    "the only significant difference between the loci of the lbqs and fbqs composites occurs in the redshift interval @xmath149 where the stronger ly@xmath82 emission discussed by brotherton et al . causes the fbqs composite to become bluer than the lbqs composite .",
    "the fbqs composite is marginally redder than the lbqs composite at redshifts @xmath150 but the difference is small relative to the intrinsic spread among the individual quasars and relative to the distance of the loci from the lbqs colour  selection boundary .",
    "there is no evidence for any significant difference in the distribution of colours of the 76 radio  detected quasars compared to the lbqs quasars as a whole .",
    "if the seds of the radio  detected objects were significantly redder ( over the observed  frame wavelength interval @xmath151 ) the objects would possess larger hpp values at a given redshift .",
    "the similarity of the lbqs and fbqs composite spectra , coupled with the very similar distributions of quasars with and without radio detections in the lbqs colour  selection space , suggests that systematic differences between the seds of radio  detected quasars and the population as a whole are not large .",
    "the availability of the fbqs and lbqs composite spectra allows a more direct estimate of the surface density of radio  detected quasars for a sample flux  limited in the palomar @xmath133 passband .",
    "table 9 lists the @xmath152 and @xmath153 colours for the fbqs and lbqs composite spectra as a function of redshift .",
    "the maximum redshifts are set by the point at which the lyman@xmath82 forest begins to affect the flux in the @xmath35 and @xmath42 passbands significantly .",
    "the composite spectra are , by their nature , made up from quasars with an extended range of redshift and the depression of the continuum at rest ",
    "frame wavelengths @xmath154  does not reproduce the behaviour seen in actual quasars at the higher redshifts .",
    "the colours were calculated using the palomar @xmath42 and @xmath133 sensitivity curves of minkowski & abell ( 1963 ) and our own determination of the @xmath35 sensitivity .",
    "the filter plus emulsion sensitivity curves were combined with one reflection off aluminium and atmospheric absorption and extinction appropriate for observations made at an airmass of 1.3 for a relatively low  altitude site such as siding spring or mount palomar .",
    "the synthetic photometry was performed using the synphot package in the space telescope science data analysis system .",
    "the @xmath152 colours show significant variations with redshift , including a prominent redward excursion at @xmath155 where [ ] @xmath814959,5007 and h@xmath80 emission moves through the narrow @xmath133passband .",
    "additional redshift increments have been included in table 9 to quantify the rapid change in the colours at @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath157 magnitude reddening in the @xmath152 colours coincides exactly with the excess of quasars seen at this redshift in the fbqs redshift distribution ( white et al .",
    "2000 ; figure 12 ) .    taking a redshift range of @xmath147 , with the lower limit set by the lbqs low  redshift boundary and the upper limit taken",
    "so that the fbqs colour  selection criterion of @xmath158 is not a significant factor , we estimate the true surface density of fbqs quasars at @xmath159 as follows .",
    "the 565 quasars in table 2 of white et al .",

    "the calculation was repeated using the @xmath152 colours for the lbqs composite spectrum .",
    "the resulting surface density estimates are @xmath166deg@xmath162 ( fbqs composite colours ) and @xmath167deg@xmath162 ( lbqs composite colours ) , giving a radio  detected fraction of @xmath168 .",
    "the calculation is far from ideal as no account is taken of the dispersion of seds among the quasars , i.e. , all quasars are assumed to possess the same sed .",
    "however , the insensitivity of the surface density estimate to which of the two composite spectra are used to calculate the @xmath152 colours is encouraging and the resulting radio  detected fraction is much closer to the direct estimate of @xmath169 found in this paper ( c.f . , the fraction of @xmath9 advocated by white et al . ) .",
    "the importance of establishing the transformation between magnitude bands for studies of the luminosity function and evolution of the quasar populations is evident from consideration of the redshift distributions of the lbqs and fbqs samples .",

    "brotherton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that the larger number of quasars at low redshift in the fbqs may be due to the inclusion of very bright sources in the fbqs .",
    "in fact , whether the small number ( 13 ) of very bright ( @xmath173 ) fbqs  sources are included makes no significant change to the differences evident between the two histograms .",

    "correlation of the source catalogues for the lbqs and the first survey in @xmath177 of sky common to both surveys yields 67 positional coincidences between first sources and known lbqs quasars .",
