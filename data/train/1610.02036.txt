    "<S> in quantum hall edge states and in other one - dimensional interacting systems , charge fractionalization can occur due to the fact that an injected charge pulse decomposes into eigenmodes propagating at different velocities . </S>",
    "<S> if the original charge pulse has some spatial width due to injection with a given source - drain voltage , a finite time is needed until the separation between the fractionalized pulses is larger than their width . in the formalism of non - equilibrium bosonization , the above physics is reflected in the separation of initially overlapping square pulses in the effective scattering phase . </S>",
    "<S> when expressing the single particle green s function as a functional determinant of counting operators containing the scattering phase , the time evolution of charge fractionalization is mathematically described by functional determinants with overlapping pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a framework for the evaluation of such determinants , describe the system s equilibration dynamics , and compare our theoretical results with recent experimental findings . </S>"
