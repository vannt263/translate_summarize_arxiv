    "tunneling ionization of deep centers in a terahertz field of high - intensity far - infrared laser radiation , with photon energies tens of times lower than the impurity binding energies has been investigated in great detail during the last decade  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to tunneling ionization of atoms , where only electron tunneling takes place , ionization of impurities in solids is accomplished by two simultaneous processes : electron tunneling through the potential well formed by the attractive force of the impurity and the externally applied electric field and the redistribution of the vibrational system by defect tunneling . at very high radiation electric field strengths",
    "direct tunneling may occur without involving phonons .",
    "the tunneling probability is independent on the radiation frequency up to very high frequencies . in this quasi - static regime ,",
    "electrons tunnel at constant energy in a time much shorter than the reciprocal radiation frequency @xmath1 . at higher frequencies",
    ", however , tunneling probability drastically increases in comparison to the tunneling in @xmath2 field of the same field strength . in such a high - frequency regime electrons can absorb energy from the radiation field during tunneling leaving the barrier at higher energy . by this the effective width of the tunneling barrier is reduced and , thus , the tunneling probability enhanced .    in a semiclassical approach defect tunneling takes place from the adiabatic potential corresponding to the impurity bound state to the state where the carrier is detached from the impurity .",
    "the tunneling probability is controlled by the bttiker - landauer tunneling time  @xcite @xmath3 which is a function of temperature .",
    "the transition from frequency independent tunneling in a classical electric field to fully quantized multi - photon transitions occurs in the terahertz range and may be explored applying high - power far - infrared lasers .",
    "the borderline is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radiation frequency .",
    "these considerations are based on semiclassical theory where the carriers have a classical trajectory . in this case",
    "the tunneling probability is expected to be affected by the strength and the orientation of an external magnetic field . for electron tunneling through static potential barriers this effect",
    "was theoretically investigated in  @xcite and observed in quantum well structures  @xcite .",
    "the theory has been extended for phonon - assisted tunneling ionization of deep impurities in @xmath2 electric fields  @xcite and in high frequency alternating fields  @xcite showing that also in the case of phonon - assisted tunneling , even in the high - frequency regime , the carrier emission is suppressed by an external magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) . in this work",
    "we give evidence for the applicability of the semiclassical model to tunneling assisted by phonons which is concluded from the experimental observation of the suppression of tunneling probability by an external magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the carrier trajectory .",
    "we have shown in  @xcite that the probability of phonon assisted tunneling depends on the strength of * _ e _ * , an oscillating electric field of frequency @xmath5 : @xmath7 \\quad     { \\rm with } \\quad     ( e_c^*)^2 = \\frac{3 m^ * \\hbar}{e^2 ( \\tau^*)^3 }     \\label{e18}\\ ] ] with electron effective mass @xmath8 and @xmath9 the frequency dependence of the tunneling process is controlled by @xmath10 where the tunneling time @xmath3 depends on temperature : @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is of the order of the period of the impurity vibration and plus and minus correspond to substitutional and auto - localized impurities , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ e20 ] ) that for @xmath13 the effective time @xmath14 gets equal to the tunneling time @xmath3 yielding a well known formula of phonon assisted tunneling in the quasi - static regime  @xcite .    in the presence of an external magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the electric field of radiation",
    "the functional dependence of the probability on the electric field strength remains unchanged , however the value of the effective time @xmath14 becomes dependent on the magnetic field strength .",
    "an increase of the cyclotron frequency @xmath15 over the reciprocal tunneling time results in the decrease of the tunneling probability .",
    "the suppression of the tunneling probability occurs in both frequency ranges , at low frequencies , when tunneling is independent of radiation frequency , as well as at high frequencies when the tunneling probability increases drastically with rising frequency .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field * _ b _ * on tunneling is strongest if it is oriented normal to the radiation electric field * _ e _ * and vanishes if @xmath0 . for the ionization probability",
    "we again obtain an exponential dependence on the square of the electric field strength in the form of eq .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) , however , now the effective time @xmath14 depends on the magnetic field strength :    @xmath16    in fig .",
    "1 the calculated impurity ionization probability is plotted as a function of @xmath17 for various magnetic field strengths showing the drop of the carrier emission rate with increasing * _ b_*. the data are presented for two different values of @xmath10 representing the quasi - static and the high - frequency regimes .",
    "$ ] as a function of @xmath18 for different @xmath19 and @xmath20 calculated after eqs .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) , ( [ e20 ] ) and ( [ e50 ] ) for a magnetic field normal to the electric field ; @xmath5 and @xmath21 are the radiation frequency and the cyclotron frequency , respectively . here",
    "the parameter @xmath19 controls the frequency dependence of tunneling while @xmath20 reflects the influence of the magnetic field . ]",
    "the experiments were carried out on mercury doped germanium in the temperature range of 10k to 70k .",
    "tunneling ionization has been achieved by far  infrared laser radiation with photon energies much smaller than the thermal impurity ionization energy @xmath22mev .",
    "the radiation source was a pulsed far - infrared molecular laser optically pumped by a tea ",
    "co@xmath23 laser .",
    "operating the optically pumped laser with nh@xmath24 and ch@xmath24f as active gases , 40  ns pulses with intensity up to 2 mw/@xmath25 have been obtained at wavelengths of 148  @xmath26 m and 496  @xmath26 m .",
    "the ionization probability has been measured by detecting photoconductivity  @xcite . to apply a small probe voltage to the sample",
    "two ohmic contacts along @xmath27 direction were prepared .",
    "an external magnetic field _ * b * _ up to 7.5  t has been applied along @xmath27 .",
    "the ionization probability as a function of the radiation intensity @xmath28 has been obtain for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for different magnetic field strengths .",
    "in addition the magnetic field dependence of the signal has been determined for constant intensity .",
    "the orientation between the external magnetic field @xmath31 and the electric field * _ e _ * of linearly polarized terahertz radiation has been changed by means of a @xmath32 crystal quartz plate .          in fig .",
    "2 the dependence of the photoconductive signal being proportional to the ionization probability on the square of the electric field strength of the radiation is plotted for @xmath36 and @xmath37  t. results are presented for a temperature of 15  k and @xmath38 148  @xmath26 m .",
    "these measurements show that at zero magnetic field the ionization probability is independent on the electric field orientation . at high magnetic fields , however ,",
    "the signal for @xmath39 drops significantly below that of @xmath40 .",
    "this suppression of the tunneling probability can also be seen in the magnetic field dependence of the photoconductive signal shown in fig .  3 and 4 .",
    "the effect of tunneling suppression occurs only at low temperatures where , on the one side , practically all carriers are frozen out on the impurities and on the other side the tunneling time assumes high values  @xcite . at high temperatures",
    "the effect of free carrier absorption interferes with the change of conductivity by tunneling ionization .",
    "therefore no suppression of the signal could be observed .",
    "tunneling suppression has been observed in both regimes , the quasi - static limit ( @xmath35 ) at 496@xmath26 m ( fig .  3 ) and in the high - frequency limit ( @xmath34 ) obtained by the excitation with radiation of 148@xmath26 m ( fig .  4 ) .    in summary ,",
    "our present observation shows that for @xmath41 the magnetic field deflects the carriers , which increases the length of the tunneling trajectory .",
    "thus , a magnetic field reduces the ionization probability if the cyclotron frequency becomes larger than the reciprocal tunneling time .",
