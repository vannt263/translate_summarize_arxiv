    "in this conference the emphasis is on the study of _ single _ hadrons , with virtually nothing being said about systems involving more than three quarks .",
    "this is unfortunate , since it avoids much of particle physics and all of nuclear physics .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to attempt to bridge this gap . since the ability to perform accurate lattice simulations for systems containing many quarks is severely limited  with four quarks being the current maximum ",
    "the challenge is to see how ( if ) standard many - body techniques can be developed for the new situation of interacting quarks and gluons . here",
    "we immediately meet a cultural difference . for particle physicists ,",
    "the use of simply two - quark potentials in multiquark problems is not a discussion point , since they know ( believe ) that it is not possible . in spite of this , there are many - body physicists , who still believe ( hope ) that this is not so .    over the last few years attempts have been made to clarify this situation by comparing the _ exact _ energies of four - quark systems  as calculated on a lattice  with standard many - body models using only two - quark potentials  [ 1 ] .",
    "the four - quark system was studied for two reasons : + i ) accurate lattice simulations are still possible .",
    "+ ii ) it is the first step in the description of interacting hadrons , since the system can be partitioned into two colour singlets .",
    "the outcome from those pilot comparisons was that ",
    "`` beyond all reasonable doubt ''  the resulting binding energies are grossly overestimated by the models [ figure [ fig:1 ] ] and that a four - quark form factor is necessary .",
    "however , this conclusion was based on lattice data for four static quarks in quenched su(2 ) . in the present work  @xcite most of these approximations",
    "have been removed by using su(3 ) with two heavy - light mesons i.e. @xmath0 compared with the earlier @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the gauge field is now treated in the unquenched approximation .",
    "but this latter improvement only has a small effect .",
    "the corresponding many - body model now needs some additional assumptions before a comparison with the lattice data is possible .",
    "perhaps the most serious is the use of a non - relativistic kinetic energy , even though the light quark mass is approximately that of the strange quark . however , in the binding energy there is a considerable cancellation between the four- and two - quark kinetic energies , which then removes much of the kinetic energy effect from the binding energy .",
    "also the model is developed only for the spin - independent contribution to the binding energy .",
    "this requires an averaging of the lattice data . both of these assumptions",
    "are not thought to qualitatively effect the outcome .",
    "the main defect of the calculation is that , at present , comparison can only be made for small distances between the two static quarks ",
    "the region where lattice data could suffer from a lack of rotational invariance .",
    "however , in spite of these shortcomings , the result is that the use of simply two - quark potentials again overestimates the lattice binding by upto a factor of three  a result that is not expected to be qualitatively changed by other models without multi - quark interactions [ figure [ fig:2 ]  solid line ] .",
    "inclusion of a four - quark interaction term can then remove the discrepancy [ figure [ fig:2 ]  dashed line ] .",
    "the reason why the `` data - model '' comparison is good for small @xmath2 in figure [ fig:1 ] and not in figure [ fig:2 ] is simply because the @xmath0 energy  even for small @xmath3  is dominated by potential energy contributions , where the @xmath4 and @xmath5 separations are @xmath6 . as seen in figure [ fig:1 ] , at such separations the model already becomes too attractive in the absence of the form factor @xmath7 .",
    "in refs .  @xcite a model was developed for understanding the lattice energies of four static quarks + @xmath8 in terms of two - quark potentials .",
    "this model , in its simpliest form , was constructed in terms of the two basis states that can be made by partitioning the four quarks into two color singlets - namely - @xmath9[q(2)\\bar{q}(4 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b&=&[q(1)\\bar{q}(4)][q(2)\\bar{q}(3 ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] denotes a color singlet .",
    "these two states are not orthogonal and have a normalisation matrix of the form .    @xmath11    in the extreme weak coupling limit the parameter @xmath12 and in the strong coupling limit @xmath13 .",
    "however , for intermediate situations it is parametrised as @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the string energy , @xmath16 is an area defined by the positions of the quarks and @xmath17 is a free parameter .",
    "a single value for @xmath17 was then capable of giving a reasonable understanding for 100 pieces of data  the ground and first excited states of configurations from six different four - quark geometries calculated on a @xmath18 lattice . in this model",
    "the interaction between the quarks is expressed as a potential matrix of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 has the form expected in the weak coupling limit with the one - gluon - exchange - potential @xmath21 away from the weak coupling limit , @xmath7 is no longer unity and in addition @xmath22 is taken to be the full two quark potential .",
    "the energy of the four static quarks  a function of the @xmath23  is then given by diagonalising latexmath:[\\[\\label{vn }    easy to generalise to @xmath0 by integrating over the positions of the two light quarks using a suitable variational wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "this results in the need to diagonalise @xmath25 is the kinetic energy and @xmath3 is the distance between the two static quarks . in order to carry out the radial integrals in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the function @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ fexp ] was now reduced to the more symmetric form @xmath28.\\ ] ] again @xmath17 is a free parameter , which should be adjusted to fit the four - quark lattice energies .",
    "however , now only the lattice data for @xmath29 is sufficiently accurate to extract a value of @xmath17  see figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the present model is now being developed to include : + 1 ) a semi - relativistic approximation , in which for the two light quarks the kinetic energy operator in momentum space is simply replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "+ 2 ) a spin dependence in the potential between the two light quarks .    this model ,",
    "although very simple , contains the same basic assumptions made in the more elaborate many - body models that incorporate kinetic energy e.g. the resonating group method  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable that this simplified model can to some extent check the validity of its more elaborate counterparts .",
    "the comparison between lattice data and a model for the @xmath0 system supports ( confirms ) the earlier result  with four static quarks in quenched su(2 )  that four - quark energies can not be described simply in terms of two - quark potentials and that attempts to do so could lead to a large overestimate of the binding energy .",
    "one way of overcoming this problem is to include into the model a four - quark form factor  as seen in figure 2 .",
