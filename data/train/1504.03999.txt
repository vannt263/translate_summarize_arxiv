    "weak vector boson fusion ( vbf ) processes were suggested quite some time ago in the context of higgs searches @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by the presence of two jets with large transverse momentum @xmath7 in the forward region in opposite hemispheres along with other observables , like charged leptons .",
    "in fact , many interesting standard model ( sm ) processes , e.g. diffractive interactions , low - x qcd physics , vbf higgs production , photo - production are also accompanied by production of forward particles .",
    "interestingly lhc has a very rich  forward physics \" program and for the necessary investigation there are dedicated detectors like lhcf @xcite and(or ) fp420 @xcite .",
    "due to uncertainties in jet tagging the efficiency is relatively low and , thus , the significance of these channels is rather suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , from the discovery perspective , many beyond standard models ( bsm ) can also be tested using forward jets .",
    "such related studies are also important for dark matter searches through mono - jet plus missing energy @xcite .",
    "in this paper we continue @xcite a dedicated analysis of the minimal left - right symmetric model ( mlrsm ) @xcite aiming at exhaustive exploration of interesting bsm signals at present and future hadron colliders left and right gauge couplings , @xmath8 , and a scalar potential which contains a bidoublet and two triplet scalar multiplets , considered for the first time in @xcite , see also @xcite . ] . for",
    "many reasons the parity breaking scale @xmath0 of the right @xmath9 group in mlrsm must be already around @xmath10 tev @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed recently in @xcite , in such models charged higgs bosons can have masses at the much lower level of a few hundred gev , and that scenario is still consistent with experimental data . in this case , it is imperative to cover all possible scenarios , and their potential effects at the lhc should be analyzed carefully .",
    "interestingly enough , a recent cms study @xcite can be interpreted as favoring right handed currents .    in our previous analyses",
    "we have worked with the scalar mass spectra which are compatible with the unitarity of the potential parameters , the large parity breaking scale @xmath0 and the severe bounds on neutral scalar masses ( @xmath11 ) derived from flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . in this work",
    "we have further implemented another necessary condition : vacuum stability of the scalar potential .",
    "it appears that even after taking into account all these constraints , the consistent scalar mass spectra can accommodate doubly charged higgs boson masses in a region which can be explored by the lhc .    in the past",
    ", we have focused on searches for multi - lepton signals associated with any number of jets ; i.e. , there was no jet veto . here",
    ", the analysis of possible vbf - type signals with four leptons and two jets using suitable vbf cuts is presented .",
    "we have used our version of the left - right symmetric model implemented in feynrules ( v2.0.31 ) @xcite .",
    "the general signal and background analyses for multi - lepton and tagged forward jets are performed using alpgen ( v2.14 ) @xcite , madgraph ( v2.2.2 ) @xcite and pythia ( v6.421 ) @xcite .",
    "there are many interesting channels in which doubly charged higgs particles can be produced in mlrsm . in the hadron collider ,",
    "productions of doubly charged higgs particles crucially depend on their couplings with vector bosons .",
    "these charged scalars ( @xmath12 ) are produced either through neutral and charged currents or fusion processes .",
    "representative classes of diagrams which contribute to @xmath13 productions associated with two jets are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbfhpmpmx ] .    if @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbfhpmpmx ] , then doubly charged higgs particles are produced in pairs .",
    "assuming further that @xmath12 decays predominantly into leptons , a signal of four leptons associated with two forward jets in the final state is foreseen , @xmath4 . in the drell - yan case",
    "also [ see the diagram ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbfhpmpmx ] ] , if @xmath15 , a four leptons plus two jets signal is possible , though its contribution is suppressed once the vbf cuts are activated .",
    "+    we should also mention that vector boson fusion diagrams interfere substantially with bremsstrahlung - like ( or drell - yan ) processes @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the pair production of doubly charged scalars associated with two forward jets . as mentioned already",
    ", this signature can be promising since lhc has dedicated search channels for tagged forward jets .",
    "vbf processes with doubly charged higgs bosons have been considered lately in @xcite with the main focus on three lepton signals with missing energy and in @xcite where doubly charged higgs bosons decay into same - sign @xmath16 bosons . in @xcite",
    "there is also an interesting discussion on scalar corrections to the self - energy of @xmath17 and the @xmath18 parameter .",
    "it has been argued that there exist severe constraints on the charged scalar mass splitting .",
    "however , in our opinion conclusions based on partial results and a single class of ( scalar ) diagrams can be deceptive ; thus , we need to consider complete calculations including renormalization .",
    "we recall a series of papers on the 1-loop corrections to the muon decay in mlrsm , starting with qualitative results @xcite and finishing with quantitative analysis @xcite .",
    "the upshot of all these analyses , important for our present discussion , is that there is a strong fine - tuning between contributions to @xmath18 from different classes of non - standard particles : higgs and additional gauge _ bosons _ and heavy neutrinos ( _ fermions _ ) . by their nature ,",
    "cancellations among bosonic and fermionic types of diagrams are present , and a change of mass spectrum of the higgs bosons can be compensated for by different choices of @xmath0 scale ( gauge bosons ) and masses of heavy neutrinos .",
    "these analyses in the context of the lhc have been considered in detail in @xcite .",
    "analysis of the lhc data provides lower limits on the doubly charged higgs mass @xcite depending on their leptonic decay branching fractions . in the scenario",
    "where @xmath21 , that limit is @xmath22 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : atlas_excl ] for details .",
    "limits on the mlrsm potential parameters have been discussed lately in @xcite .",
    "similar to the earlier case , we focus on the @xmath19 and @xmath23 parameters , which are important for the scalar mass spectrum ( all notations are as in @xcite ) .",
    "first , to suppress fcnc effects generated by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we assume that their mass is bigger than @xmath26 . because @xmath27 , this results in the following lower limit on @xmath19 : @xmath28 taking into account that @xmath29 , one gets @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the third constraint originates from the _ necessary condition _ of the boundedness of the potential @xcite : @xmath32 the value of @xmath33 is fixed by the lightest neutral higgs boson mass as @xmath34 .",
    "now it is interesting and important to ask what is the maximum allowed mass splitting @xmath35 that will be consistent with the bounds on @xmath36 derived above .",
    "such queries can not be unnoticed from a phenomenological perspective because only for @xmath37 can the doubly charged higgs have the following decay : @xmath38 .",
    "this has a massive impact on the decay branching ratios of @xmath13 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the biggest @xmath39 is reached for @xmath20 , saturating both inequalities in eqs .",
    "( [ alpha - lhc ] ) and ( [ alpha - jd ] ) which imply @xmath40 the physical solution to this equation and the corresponding maximal value of @xmath39 is    @xmath41    where ` @xmath42 ' stands for corrections of the order of @xmath43 .",
    "one can check that @xmath39 depends on @xmath0 very weakly and is nearly equal to the asymptotic value @xmath44 , for @xmath45 . as @xmath46",
    ", this implies that on - shell decay @xmath38 is kinematically forbidden regardless of the scale @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , we came to the same conclusion as in @xcite , but based on different kinds of arguments .",
    "there is another consequence of the requirement that the scalar potential is bounded from below .",
    "namely , one can show that , using eqs .",
    "( [ alpha - fcnc ] ) and ( [ alpha - jd ] ) , in the allowed parameter space there is an upper limit on the @xmath47 mass : @xmath48 where ` @xmath42 ' stands for the corrections of order of @xmath49 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath50 is reached for @xmath20 satisfying @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which correspond to the intersection point of lines restricting regions defined by eqs .",
    "( [ alpha - fcnc ] ) and ( [ alpha - jd ] ) .",
    "the situation is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : split ] .",
    "naturally , the minimal value of the @xmath47 mass in the discussed setup is @xmath53 . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us note that if there are no experimental limits on @xmath50 and @xmath54 , then the lowest possible mass of @xmath47 consistent with the vacuum stability bound , eq .",
    "( [ alpha - jd ] ) , would be @xmath55 , which corresponds to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , the mlrsm does not provide any relevant constraints on the @xmath58 mass for @xmath59 .",
    "it comes from the assumption that scalar potential parameter @xmath60 is in the perturbative regime @xmath61 . ] .",
    "we would like to mention that when @xmath60 satisfies @xmath62 then a similar type of decay of @xmath63 is kinematically forbidden as @xmath58 is too light to decay into @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively ; see the benchmarks in the next section .",
    "before we discuss our simulated results , selection criteria should be defined , which are crucial for extracting proper signals and reducing the sm background . for selecting leptons",
    ", we use the same criteria as defined in previous papers @xcite , which are read as follows :    * lepton identification criteria : pseudo - rapidity @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; * detector efficiency for charged leptons : * * electron ( either @xmath68 ) : @xmath69 ; * * muon ( either @xmath70 ) : @xmath71 ; * smearing of muon @xmath72 and electron energy are implemented in pythia ; * lepton - lepton separation : @xmath73 ; * lepton - photon separation : @xmath74 where all the photons have @xmath75 ; * we have implemented a @xmath76-veto to suppress the sm background , and this has a larger impact while reducing the background for the four - lepton without missing energy .",
    "this veto reads as follows : the same flavored but opposite sign lepton pair invariant mass @xmath77 must be sufficiently away from the sm @xmath76-boson mass , say , @xmath78 gev ; * lepton - jet separation : the separation of a lepton with all nearby jets must satisfy @xmath79 . if this is not satisfied , then that lepton is not counted as a lepton . for completeness",
    ", we must mention that jets are constructed from hadrons using pycell within pythia ; * hadronic activity cut : this cut is applied to consider only those leptons that have much less hadronic activity around them .",
    "each lepton should have hadronic activity which is accounted as @xmath80 within the cone of radius @xmath81 around the lepton ; * hard @xmath72 cuts for four lepton events : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    ".selection criteria for the forward jets .",
    "the two highest @xmath72 jets @xmath86 are chosen as the vbf forward jets . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the sm background at the lhc for the signal @xmath87 jets is accounted from the process @xmath88 .",
    "we have noted that after implementation of the selection cuts , the dominant background is contributed from the @xmath89 process .",
    "for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 @xmath93 collisions , the sm background is given in tab .",
    "[ table : lllljj_14tev ] both at the parton level and after hadronization and passing through implemented cuts .",
    "we can see that the background is suppressed very effectively .",
    "the results in tab .  [ table : lllljj_14tev ] are obtained in the leading order ; electroweak corrections can change the results not more than @xmath94 @xcite which can change the significance of signals at the level of about one percent at most .     +    finally , to judge the strength of the mlrsm signals we decided to show the dependence of the significance of the result as a function of the integrated luminosity . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : signif ] ( left - top ) , a comfortable value of the significance at the level of @xmath95 can be reached for @xmath96 in @xmath93 collisions with    * @xmath97 tev and with 100 @xmath98 integrated luminosity ; * @xmath99 tev and with 700 @xmath98 integrated luminosity .",
    "no signal at this significance level ( @xmath100 ) can be reached with @xmath101 @xmath93 collisions , even if the integrated luminosity is around 3000 @xmath98 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : signif ] ( right - top ) we can see that doubly charged higgs bosons with masses up to @xmath102 with significance at the level of 5 can be probed for both center of mass energy 33 and 100 tev with integrated luminosities around 3000 and 300 @xmath98 , respectively . in fig .  [",
    "fig : signif ] ( left - bottom ) it is evident that the 1 tev doubly charged scalar can be probed with a significance of 5 only with 100 the tev collider with luminosity at least 1000 @xmath98 . the fig .",
    "[ fig : signif ] ( right - bottom ) summarizes the situation for the fcc - hh collider option for three different sets of masses of doubly charged scalars : 500 , 600 , 700 , 800 , 900 and 1000 gev .",
    "this figure also shows that significance at the level of 7 can be reached for @xmath103 and @xmath97 tev with integrated luminosities around 3000 @xmath98 .",
    "we can see that this collider opens up a very wide range of higgs boson masses which can be explored .",
    "in this paper we have considered production and decays of a pair of doubly charged higgs bosons through vector boson fusion within the mlrsm framework . to do",
    "so we have evaluated suitable benchmark points for masses of higgs bosons , which are in agreement with several constraints coming from fcnc , vacuum stability , lepii and recent atlas searches on doubly charged scalars .",
    "there are strong relations among masses of doubly and singly charged and neutral scalars which prevent us from choosing their individual values freely , leaving us with the suitable benchmarks we are using in this paper .",
    "we have further noted and shown that the splitting between the doubly ( @xmath104 ) and singly ( @xmath105 ) charged scalars is less than @xmath106 , irrespective of the @xmath107 breaking scale .",
    "thus , the on - shell decay @xmath108 is protected and the decay branching ratio of the doubly charged scalar @xmath104 is affected .    after settling these issues regarding the spectrum ,",
    "we have computed the signal cross section for the process @xmath4 using realistic cuts . the necessary sm background for this final state is also evaluated .",
    "it has been shown that lhc2 even with high integrated luminosity will be not be sensitive to the vbf - like signals @xmath109 , even with relatively light doubly charged higgs bosons ( say , @xmath110 ) .",
    "we have shown that much better perspective exists for the future fcc colliders with center of mass energies 33 and ( or ) @xmath92 .",
    "in passing we would like to mention that we have used the vbf cuts as adopted in @xcite . we have compared the atlas and cms ( tight and loose ) suggested cuts which are not very widely different from significance point of view .",
    "let us conclude with a comparative comment : mlrsm vbf - like signals connected with @xmath63 scalar production ( which is part of the right - handed triplet ) is comparable with the @xmath104 scalar production , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xsection_1effh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : xsection_1effh2 ] ) .",
    "thus the cross section for signal events are larger compare to that for type - ii seesaw scenario with same masses for triplet scalars .",
