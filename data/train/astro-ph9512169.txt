    "ionized gas is known to extend ( up to @xmath81 kpc ) out of the plane in normal spiral galaxies ( e.g. dettmar 1992 ) .",
    "the origin and maintenance of this component of the interstellar medium in normal galaxies is not completely understood , but most theories support the notion that it is energized by outflows from the galaxy disk ( cf .",
    "rand 1995 ) .    in powerful infrared ( ir )",
    "galaxies , extraplanar ionized gas is much more luminous and is detectable much further ( up to tens of kpc , heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) out into the halo .",
    "the origin of these more extended structures is also explained by outflows from the galaxy .",
    "nuclear starbursts in these galaxies produce stellar winds and supernovae which rapidly heat the gas in the nuclear region .",
    "this high - pressure gas then expands rapidly and blows a wind out of the nuclear region , along the rotation axis of the disk , where the pressure gradient is lowest .",
    "this ` superwind ' interacts with clouds of dense gas in the galaxy and its halo , producing optical emission - line filaments ( see , e.g. , heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) .",
    "material swept up by the wind accumulates behind the shock front , forming a large shell ( or ` bubble ' ) along the minor axis .",
    "line emission which is observed from the shell should then have two velocity components , one from the front surface of the shell and one from the rear surface .",
    "such double - peaked emission - line profiles are indeed commonly found in minor axis spectra of superwind galaxies ( cf .",
    "heckman , lehnert & armus 1993 ) , corroborating that wind - blown bubbles are present .",
    "superwinds also manifest themselves at radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the radio halos in edge - on starburst galaxies produce synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the wind .",
    "thermal x - rays are emitted by hot , expanding gas in the bubble and by low - density halo clouds which have been shocked by the wind .",
    "a well studied example of an extended halo is that in the edge - on starburst galaxy m82 ( radio : e.g. , seaquist & odegard 1991 ; x - ray : bregman 1994 ) .",
    "more examples are discussed in a recent review of observational and theoretical aspects of superwinds in starburst galaxies by heckman , lehnert & armus ( 1993 ) .",
    "approximately 1% of spiral galaxies have an active ( seyfert ) nucleus , which is commonly believed to be an accretion - powered supermassive black hole , i.e. , a scaled - down version of a quasar ( see , e.g. , terlevich 1992 for an alternate view ) .",
    "the emission from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) dominates the luminosity at most wavelengths , so most studies of seyferts have focused on observing the properties of the agn itself and the environment it creates in and immediately around the nuclear region ( see , e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "there is good evidence that nuclear outflows exist on pc scales in some seyferts ( cf .",
    "wilson 1993 ) , but it is not clear that these small - scale ( @xmath91 kpc ) outflows are connected with large - scale galactic outflows .",
    "observations of the large - scale ( @xmath01 kpc ) emission in seyferts do show that , in some cases , galactic - scale minor - axis outflows are present ( e.g. , hummel , van gorkom & kotanyi 1983 , hamilton & keel 1987 , corbin 1988 , wehrle & morris 1988 ) . in a sample of seyfert galaxies selected for extended optical or radio emission , baum ( 1993 ) found kpc - scale radio emission extending preferentially along the minor axes in seven out of ten cases and suggested that the emission comes from galactic winds blowing out of the galaxy disks .",
    "a particularly good example of a galactic outflow can be found in the edge - on seyfert galaxy ngc  5506 .",
    "diffuse radio emission is found out to @xmath3300  pc from the nucleus in the direction of the minor axis ( wehrle & morris 1987 ) and double - peaked emission - line profiles are found in minor axis spectra from regions @xmath3500 pc above and below the disk ( wilson , baldwin & ulvestad 1985 ) .",
    "the question of what powers galactic outflows in seyferts remains open , but viable sources of kinetic energy are nuclear starbursts and the active nucleus .    why study galactic outflows in seyferts ?",
    "so far , only anecdotal evidence has been presented for them and they have not been systematically studied .",
    "one would like to know how galactic outflows in seyferts are different from those in more powerful agns ( e.g. radio galaxies , balqsos ) and also from those in starburst galaxies . from a broader standpoint , one would like to know what influence the outflows have on the agn and its host galaxy .",
    "galactic outflows drive large amounts of gas ( and metals ) out of the nuclear region , whereas the agn needs a constant supply of gas flowing inward .",
    "thus , galactic outflows in seyferts may regulate the power output and lifetime of the active nucleus .",
    "if the outflows are driven by starbursts , then what role , if any , do these nuclear starbursts play in the formation and evolution of the active nucleus ?",
    "many workers have proposed scenarios in which seyferts and starbursts are connected in an evolutionary sense ( e.g. scoville 1992 ) , but the issue remains open .",
    "the outflows may also have a strong influence on the physical state of the intergalactic medium .",
    "plasma which is blown out of the galaxy will increase the density of the intergalactic medium , heat it , and enhance its metallicity .    in order to address these questions ,",
    "we have begun a research program to systematically study a complete sample of edge - on seyfert galaxies .",
    "we shall search for observational evidence of galactic outflows , determine their physical properties and investigate possible energy sources for driving the outflows . in paper",
    "i , we present optical emission - line images and/or minor - axis spectra of the ionized gas in 22 edge - on seyfert galaxies .",
    "our future work will consist of analyzing the large - scale radio and x - ray emission from these outflows , using the same sample of edge - on seyferts .",
    "in section 2 , we introduce a statistical sample of seyfert galaxies which we shall use for continuing studies .",
    "observations and data reduction techniques are described in section 3 and images and spectra are presented for individual objects in section 4 . in section 5 , we discuss the frequency of occurrence of large - scale outflows in seyferts and discuss possible interpretations of energy sources driving the outflows .",
    "a hubble constant of 75 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 is assumed throughout this paper .",
    "extended optical emission - line gas is difficult to observe in face - on disk galaxies , due to confusion with emission from the disk .",
    "we have therefore chosen to study only edge - on systems .",
    "we have defined a ` complete , ' distance - limited statistical sample of edge - on seyferts which we shall use in continuing studies .",
    "first , we selected seyferts ( liners were omitted ) from an electronic version of the seyfert catalog by huchra ( 1993 ) .",
    "this list was cross - referenced by position with an electronic version ( vers .",
    "3.9 ) of the _ third reference catalog of bright galaxies _ ( de  vaucouleurs 1991;rc3 ) . using recessional velocities ( @xmath10 ; 21  cm preferred ) and axial ratios ( @xmath11 ; major to minor ) from rc3 , we then selected objects by restricting @xmath12 5500 km  s@xmath7 and @xmath13 0.4 ( @xmath14 2.5 ) . using the same method",
    ", we made another list starting from an electronic version of veron - cetty & veron s ( 1991 ) seyfert catalog .",
    "the two lists were then combined .",
    "a few additional seyferts which satisfied the restrictions listed above were selected by hand from hewitt & burbidge ( 1991 ) and from the literature .",
    "our complete sample consists of 22 objects .",
    "morphological types , positions , axial ratios , recessional velocities and seyfert types for each galaxy are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have obtained 2 images and/or long - slit spectra ( near h@xmath1 ) for 14 of these 22 objects .",
    "no bias was used to select these objects for observation .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to this sub - sample ( marked by a dagger [ ] in table 1 ) as our ` representative ' sample and shall use it for computing statistics in section 5 .",
    "we have also obtained images and/or spectra for eight additional edge - on seyferts which have @xmath15 5500 km  s@xmath7 , @xmath16 0.4 , or both .",
    "morphological types , positions , axial ratios , recessional velocities and seyfert types for these galaxies are listed in table 2 .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to the sample of all objects observed as our ` extended ' sample .",
    "these 22 objects are the 14 objects marked by a dagger in table 1 plus the eight objects listed in table 2 .",
    "we shall use this extended sample for computing statistics as well ( section 5 ) .",
    "a log of new imaging and spectroscopic observations using the kpno 2.1  m telescope is given in table 3 .",
    "these data were supplemented by additional 2 images , taken at the 2.1  m telescope at kpno , the 1.5  m telescope at the cerro telolo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , and the 2.2  m telescope at the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "information about the observations for these supplemental images can be found in mulchaey , wilson & tsvetanov ( 1996 ) and tsvetanov , fosbury & tadhunter ( 1995 ) .",
    "reduction of the data was performed using the ccdproc analysis programs in iraf .",
    "the raw ccd images were processed in the normal fashion by subtracting bias frames and dividing by normalized images of the dome or blank sky .",
    "atmospheric extinction corrections were performed ( for all of the data ) using extinction curves appropriate for each observing site .    during",
    "the imaging runs at the kpno 2.1  m ( august 1992 and february 1993 ) , two exposures of 1800 s were taken through narrow - band ( full width at half maximum [ fwhm ] @xmath3 75 ) filters centered near h@xmath1 . to produce an image of only the 2 line emission , an r - band image ( exposure 300 s )",
    "was scaled and subtracted from the narrow - band image .",

    "the long - slit spectra were taken in january and june 1992 at the kpno 2.1  m telescope .",
    "two exposures of 1800  s were taken with the slit oriented parallel to the galaxy s minor axis and passing through its nucleus .",
    "one exposure of 1800 s was taken along the major axis .",
    "frequent observations of a quartz lamp were used to remove the high spatial frequency structure .",
    "henear spectra were used for wavelength calibration and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars were used for absolute flux calibration .",
    "the width of the slit was 1.75 , except for ark  79 , ngc  931 , ngc  5506 and ic  1368 , for which it was 2.0 .",
    "limiting surface brightness levels at h@xmath1 are a factor of several better that those for the imaging data .",
    "the spectral coverage included h@xmath1 , [ n  ii ] @xmath21 6548 ,  6583 and [ s  ii ] @xmath21 6716 ,  6731 .",
    "continuum - free 2 images from mulchaey , wilson & tsvetanov ( 1996 ) and tsvetanov , fosbury & tadhunter ( 1995 ) were made by combining narrow - band ( fwhm @xmath350@xmath5100 ) images centered on h@xmath1 with narrow - band images of the nearby continuum .",
    "the images were flux calibrated from observations of spectrophotometric standard stars .",

    "we also list the total 2 luminosity from the galaxy for all objects for which we have 2 images , and the total 2 luminosity from the minor - axis emission - line gas for galaxies in which emission - line regions ( elrs ) are evident along the minor axis .",
    "the total 2 luminosity from the galaxy was calculated by summing the flux inside rectangular regions enclosing all of the emission - line nebulae from the galaxy .",
    "the 2 luminosities of the minor - axis elrs were calculated by summing flux inside rectangular regions around the individual elrs mentioned in sections 4.1 and 4.2 .    in the following subsections , we present and discuss our new images and spectra and",
    "also note whether other data which has been published is suitable for searching for evidence for minor - axis outflows .",
    "seyferts which are good candidates for having such outflows are identified and statistical results for our samples are discussed in section 5 .      for each of the galaxies in our complete sample , we searched the literature for published data which could be used to look for signatures of minor - axis outflows . for many of the objects ( ic  1657 , um  319 , mrk  993 , mrk  577 , ark  79 , ngc  1320 , mcg  @xmath52 - 27 - 9 , ngc  4602 , eso  103-g35 , ngc  6810 , ic  1417 , ngc  7410 and ngc  7590 ) , the published data was not suitable",
    "exceptions are noted in the following subsections .",
    "our images for mrk  993 are shown in figure 1a .",
    "many elrs are scattered throughout the galactic disk , but no minor - axis emission is evident in our 2 image .",
    "we did not find double - peaked line profiles or any evidence for elrs extending out of the disk in our minor axis spectra .",
    "no extraplanar emission is noticeable in our 2 image ( figure 1b ) .",
    "the spectrum from the position 3.1  ( @xmath31 kpc ) south ( along the minor axis ) of the nucleus may have double - peaked h@xmath1 , [ nii ] and [ s  ii ] emission line profiles ( consistent with what is expected from the shell of an wind - blown bubble ) , but the possible substructure in the profiles is nearly the same level of magnitude as the noise .",
    "for this reason , we have classified these features as only suggestive of a minor axis outflow .",
    "spectra with higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios would be useful for determining if these components are double peaked emission lines from a wind - blown bubble .",

    "this galaxy forms a pair with ngc  1321 , which is positioned @xmath31.7  to the north .      ngc  1386 is located in the fornax cluster , so we have used the distance to that cluster ( 20 mpc ) in our calculations . in the 2 image ( figure 1e )",
    ", there is an elr with luminosity 3.1 @xmath17 10@xmath22 erg  s@xmath7 to the northwest , at a distance of 41  ( 4.0 kpc ) from the nucleus .",
    "the continuum emission from the disk extends out to this position , so the elr could lie in the the plane of the galaxy disk .",
    "alternatively , the emission could be from gas in a halo cloud which has been ionized by a wind .",
    "weaver , wilson & baldwin ( 1991 ) have used long - slit spectroscopy to study the kinematics of the extranuclear gas within @xmath312(@xmath31 kpc ) .",
    "the line profiles and line ratios of the elrs surrounding the nucleus suggest that an outflow from the nucleus may be occurring along the _ major _ axis .",
    "ulvestad & wilson ( 1984 ) found that the morphology of the nuclear radio continuum emission is slightly extended @xmath3 400 pc toward the southwest along position angle ( p.a . )",
    "although there is good evidence for a nuclear outflow in ngc  1386 , it does not appear to be directed along the minor axis .",
    "except for the northwest elr , all of the line emission originates from @xmath91 kpc .",
    "more solid evidence is needed to conclude that a galactic scale outflow ( i.e. one blowing out of the galactic disk ) is present in this galaxy .",
    "a dust lane separates the line emission which immediately surrounds the nucleus ( see figure 1f ) from the bright ( l@xmath23 } = $ ] 3.6 @xmath17 10@xmath4 erg  s@xmath7 ) elr which extends from @xmath35@xmath515  ( 0.6@xmath52.2 kpc ) to the northwest , in the direction of the minor axis . a number of ionized filaments of luminosity @xmath310@xmath22 erg  s@xmath7 are also present beyond the northwest elr , at distances @xmath2430  ( 4.5 kpc ) .",

    "radio continuum maps of the nuclear region ( ulvestad & wilson 1989 ) are unresolved or very slightly resolved . no extended emission was noticed by hummel , beck & dettmar ( 1991 ) in their large - scale radio map .",
    "we did not obtain any new images or spectra of ngc  4388 since there is already good evidence for a galactic outflow in this galaxy .",
    "corbin , baldwin & wilson ( 1988 ) and pogge ( 1988 ) have shown that conical structures of ionized gas extend outward from the nucleus , both above and below the disk .",
    "these authors argue that some of the line - emitting gas may have been ejected from the nucleus .",
    "radio maps of this galaxy ( hummel 1983 ; stone , wilson & ward 1988 ) reveal diffuse emission extending outward from the nucleus , perpendicular to the galactic disk .      much of the emission in our 2 image ( figure 1i ) comes from a ring structure in the disk ( buta & de  vaucouleurs 1983 ) , but no emission is evident along the minor axis .",

    "a ` loop ' of radio continuum emission extends to the north from the nuclear region ( wehrle & morris 1987 ) .",

    "eso  362-g8 , the nebulae have conical morphologies , similar to ` ionization cones ' observed in some seyfert galaxies ( e.g. pogge 1989 , wilson & tsvetanov 1994 ) . the line emission from the extranuclear gas in these objects",

    "further optical studies of the minor axis nebulae in these galaxies would be useful for determining if galactic outflows are present .",
    "if we ignore the results in the literature and only consider results from the images and spectra we obtained , we find that for the 14 objects in our representative sample , four ( 29% ) show good evidence for minor axis outflows . including the objects from table 2 , six ( 27% ) of the 22 objects in our extended sample show good evidence for minor axis outflows .    as mentioned in section 4.1",
    ", there is evidence in the literature for minor - axis outflows in two additional seyferts in our complete sample ( ngc  4388 and ngc  4945 ) .",
    "all objects which show good evidence for minor axis outflows ( from our images and spectra or from the literature ) are marked with an asterisk in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "if we include the results from the literature , we find good evidence for minor axis outflows in four ( 29% ) of the 14 objects in our representative sample , six ( 27% ) of the 22 objects in our complete sample , and six ( 27% ) of the 22 objects in our extended sample .",
    "the results are consistent : @xmath325@xmath530% of edge - on seyferts show good evidence for large - scale galactic outflows .",
    "these results underestimate the `` true '' fraction of seyferts which have minor axis outflows . for many of the objects , data suitable for detecting emission from these outflows ( e.g. h@xmath1 images , long - slit spectra of the minor - axis elrs , deep radio - continuum images , deep x - ray images ) are not available .",
    "in addition , our images are only sensitive to surface brightnesses @xmath010@xmath18 erg  s@xmath7  @xmath19  arcsec@xmath20 and we have minor axis spectra to search for double - peaked emission lines for only nine of 22 objects observed .",
    "detailed kinematic studies of extended emission - line regions in seyferts are very useful for determining if an outflow is present , but such studies have been published for very few objects in our samples . assuming our edge - on samples are unbiased subsamples of seyfert galaxies",
    ", our results suggest that large - scale galactic outflows are likely to be present in @xmath0@xmath2 of _ all _ seyfert galaxies .    in table 5 , we list all seyfert galaxies known ( by us ) to have good evidence for galactic outflows .",
    "evidence comes in the form of optical emission - line nebulae and split emission lines along the minor axis , extended radio continuum emission along the minor axis , and extended x - ray halos along the minor axis .",
    "most of the outflows which have been identified are in seyferts with edge - on disks .",
    "outflows in only a few of these galaxies ( e.g. ngc  3079 , mrk  231 and ngc  4945 ) have been studied in detail .",
    "the question of what powers large - scale outflows in seyferts remains open even for the most well - studied cases .",
    "for example , in a very complete kinematic fabry - perot study of the two bi - symmetric wind - blown superbubbles in the nucleus of ngc  3079 , veilleux ( 1994 ) found that either a starburst- or an agn - driven wind was consistent . in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss two scenarios for powering the large - scale outflows in seyferts : starburst - driven superwinds and outflows from the active nucleus .",
    "superwinds in starburst galaxies have been fairly well studied ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ; lehnert & heckman 1995 ) , so it is natural to compare properties of large - scale outflows in seyferts with those of superwinds in starburst galaxies .",
    "the superwind in the archetypical edge - on starburst galaxy m82 has an 2 luminosity of @xmath310@xmath29 erg  s@xmath7 and a kinetic luminosity of 10@xmath30 erg  s@xmath7 ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) .",
    "we can estimate kinetic luminosities for the seyfert outflows by scaling l@xmath31}$ ] for our sample seyferts ( table 4 ) by the ratio of the kinetic luminosity of m82 to the 2 luminosity of its minor - axis elrs . using this method",
    ", we find kinetic luminosities @xmath310@xmath32@xmath510@xmath33 erg  s@xmath7 ( logarithmic mean 10@xmath34 erg  s@xmath7 ) for the seyfert outflows , assuming all of the line emission is produced by the outflow .",
    "the implied kinetic luminosities of our seyfert outflows are , in general , a factor @xmath30.1 as large as those of superwinds from heckman , armus & miley ( 1990 ; several @xmath17 10@xmath6 erg  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "however , the mean far - ir luminosity of our sample ( @xmath35 43.4 @xmath36[erg  s@xmath7 ] ) is smaller than that of heckman , armus & miley s sample ( @xmath35 44.9 @xmath36[erg  s@xmath7 ] ) by about the same factor , so if the seyfert outflows are powered by nuclear starbursts , smaller kinetic luminosities are to be expected .",
    "high rates of massive star formation have been inferred for the nuclear regions of several seyfert galaxies .",
    "for example , in ngc  1068 , approximately half of the ir luminosity comes from the agn and the other half comes from the starburst ( balick & heckman 1985 ) .",
    "the energy input from a possible starburst is directly proportional to the starburst component of l@xmath38 ( cf .",
    "heckman , lehnert & armus 1993 ) .",
    "however , for most seyferts , separating the starburst and agn components of l@xmath38 is not straightforward ( cf .",
    "telesco 1988 ; however , see also rodriguez - espinosa , rudy & jones 1987 , who claim that star formation produces the bulk of the far - ir emission in seyferts ) .",
    "measuring massive - star formation rates from stellar absorption lines is in general , quite difficult to do in seyferts ( cf .",
    "diaz 1992 ) .",
    "thus , it is not known how common circumnuclear starbursts are in seyferts .",
    "baum ( 1993 ) could not distinguish between starburst- or agn - driven winds using their radio data .",
    "however , they found that the luminosity of the extranuclear radio emission is comparable to that in starburst galaxies and follows the same radio - ir relation as that of starburst galaxies , suggesting that the large - scale radio emission may be of starburst origin . in order to verify that these galactic outflows are starburst - driven superwinds",
    ", one must find evidence for massive stars in the seyfert nuclei and determine if the putative starburst is powerful enough to drive a galactic wind .",
    "the agn can certainly provide enough energy to drive a galactic outflow .",
    "however , linear nuclear radio sources ( suggestive of a collimated nuclear outflow ) in seyferts are not , in general , oriented along the same position angle as the large - scale diffuse radio emission ( baum 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the large - scale minor - axis radio emission is from lobes at the end of collimated radio jets , as in powerful radio galaxies ( unless the jet outflow axis precesses ) .",
    "on the other hand , if nuclear outflows from the agn are weak , they may lose energy to the interstellar medium in the nuclear region and become poorly - collimated .",
    "if the gas continues to flow outward , it may be be diverted toward the minor axis ( where the pressure gradient is lowest ) and continue on as a wide - angled outflow .",
    "many different models have been presented for nuclear outflows from agns .",
    "theoretical models have been proposed for hydro - magnetic jets which originate from the accretion disk surrounding the black hole , or even from the black hole itself ( cf .",
    "blandford 1993 ) . another model ( krolik & begelman 1986 ; balsara & krolik 1993 )",
    "proposes that radiation - driven winds originate at the inner edge of the proposed molecular torus .",
    "thus , estimating the amount of kinetic energy being channelled from the agn into the outflow is highly model - dependent .",
    "large - scale galactic outflows are quite common in seyfert galaxies .",
    "our results show that they are present in @xmath0@xmath2 of all seyfert galaxies .",
    "current observational studies of these outflows do not offer enough information to conclude what drives the outflows .",
    "they may be powered by circumnuclear starbursts , agn , or perhaps by both , in combination . in order to constrain the different models for the outflows ,",
    "more observational work is needed to measure physical properties of these winds ( e.g. , outflow velocities , morphologies and luminosities of radio and x - ray halos , velocity and ionization structures of the outflowing gas near the nuclear region ) .",
