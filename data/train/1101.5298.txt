    "low background experiments studying rare processes  such as neutrino experiments , or projects searching for dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay  are located at deep underground sites in order to reduce the background contribution from cosmic rays by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the experiments require precise knowledge of the background induced by gamma radiation and neutrons originating from their surrounding .",
    "these values are important to estimate the experiment s sensitivity and the expected signal to background level .    to characterize an underground site the flux of gammas , neutrons , and muons ( the _ external _ background of the experiment , in contrast to the _ internal _ background from the detector itself ) are the most important parameters .",
    "detailed monte carlo simulations of underground experiments use the spectra as input in order to predict background rates or to design appropriate shielding geometries .    in this paper , we report on measurements of the gamma ray background at several locations in the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) , italy , which is one of the largest underground facilities worldwide at a depth of 3100 meters water equivalent ( equivalent vertical depth , relative to a flat overburden ) . only little information on the external background in the three large lngs halls a , b , and",
    "c is available , and there is no published data on the background in the interferometer tunnel , where several experiments are located .",
    "therefore we have measured the background in halls a and b , in the interferometer tunnel , and inside the lvd detector @xcite .",
    "it was recently suggested that lvd could be used as a very efficient muon shield , effectively increasing the lngs depth @xcite .",
    "details on the locations of the measurements reported here are given in section [ sec::locations ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig::lngs ] .",
    "the measurements were performed with nai(tl ) detectors .",
    "these are very well suited for general gamma spectroscopy as they combine the easy operation of a scintillator crystal at room temperature with a high light output and good energy resolution .",
    "the latter is necessary to extract information about the background sources via the identification of characteristic gamma lines .",
    "two different nai(tl ) detectors were used for this study : a detector with 3   diameter was used to measure the gamma background spectra as described in section [ sec::gamma ] .",
    "the environment of each measurement was modeled with the geant4 toolkit @xcite . by comparing the simulated spectra of the radioactive decay chains from @xmath2u , @xmath3th , and @xmath4k with the measured data",
    ", it is possible to deconvolute the measured spectrum into the individual contributions .",
    "this is a very powerful method to extract a maximum of information from the data .",
    "for example , a decay chain in secular equilibrium contains also alpha emitters , which can not be seen in the gamma data , however , they might affect an experiment s neutron background via @xmath5 reactions . hence , the detailed breakdown into the different background is needed for realistic background simulations of existing or future experiments . in section [ sec::neutron ]",
    "we describe the estimation of the neutron flux in the interferometer tunnel using a large 11 ",
    "diameter nai(tl ) detector .",
    "the rock of the gran sasso mountain , the concrete used to stabilize the laboratory cavities , and all detector and supporting materials of any experimental setup contain primordial gamma emitting radioactive isotopes with very long half - lifes : @xmath2u ( @xmath6  y ) , @xmath3th ( @xmath7  y ) , and @xmath4k ( @xmath8  y ) .",
    "a decay product of @xmath2u , the noble gas @xmath9rn , also contributes to the natural background radioactivity in underground laboratories as it is emanated from the rock and  being a noble gas  can rather easily enter detector systems .",
    "an isotope which is often present in the background of rare event searches is the cosmogenic @xmath10co ( @xmath11  y ) which , however , was not observed in the measurements presented here .",
    "only little information on the gamma background of lngs is published : the integrated gamma flux in hall  c was measured to be @xmath12 @xcite , in hall  a the flux below 3000  kev was measured to be @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this paper presents new measurements of the gamma flux with a commercial 3 ",
    "nai(tl ) detector .",
    "the small size of the detector allows measurements in a running laboratory , close to or even inside experimental setups .",
    "the detector consists of a cylindrical nai(tl ) crystal with 7.62  cm diameter and 7.62  cm height .",
    "it is coupled to a 3   diameter photomultiplier ( pmt ) .",
    "crystal and pmt are enclosed by an aluminum shell .",
    "the pmt signals are shaped using a spectroscopy amplifier and recorded with a 8k multichannel analyzer ( mca ) with internal triggering .",
    "the detector was set up to measure gamma energies up to 3000  kev .",
    "an external detection threshold of about 35  kev is given by the thickness of the al - enclosure of the detector , however , gamma rays at these low energies constitute only a subdominant contribution to the background flux as they can not escape the source because of the strong rise of the photoelectric effect s cross section .",
    "energy calibration and energy resolution were obtained using standard calibrated gamma sources : @xmath14co , @xmath10co , @xmath15cs , @xmath16th , and @xmath17tl .",
    "the response of the nai(tl ) scintillation detector is linear within 0.2% over the energy range of interest .",
    "its resolution @xmath18 ( fwhm ) is dominated by photo - electron statistics and can be described by @xmath19 ; this relation was experimentally verified up to 2615  kev ( @xmath17tl ) .    in order to determine the intrinsic detection efficiency of the setup , a monte carlo simulation using the precise detector geometry has been performed . from these simulations",
    "the ratio of events in the full absorption peak to events in the compton continuum has been determined for monoenergetic gamma rays .",
    "measurements with calibration sources of known activity were performed to determine the countrate in several peaks which was then compared to the expected value obtained from the simulation .",
    "the difference is due to the intrinsic detection efficiency .",
    "below 550  kev the efficiency was found to be @xmath20 with a falling trend towards higher energies because of the finite size of the scintillator crystal . in agreement with the literature expectation for this type of detector @xcite ,",
    "the efficiency is about 75% at 1000  kev and 65% at 2615  kev .",
    "the use of a small crystal is therefore no limiting factor in terms of efficiency .",
    "background measurements were performed at four underground locations at lngs ( cf .",
    "[ fig::lngs ] ) .",
    "the gamma flux was measured in hall a ( location 1 ) , hall b ( 2 ) , in the interferometer tunnel inside the xenon building ( 3 ) , and in the the lvd core facility ( lvd cf , 4 )  the innermost part of the large volume detector @xcite .",
    "the neutron flux was measured in the interferometer tunnel in front of xenon ( 3 ) .",
    "the exact positions are described in this section and indicated in the layout of the lngs underground facilities @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::lngs ] . for each location ,",
    "the measurement time was chosen such that the statistical uncertainty in the flux measurements was comparable to the systematic uncertainty from the efficiency determination .",
    "\\1 . hall a : the smallest of the three main lngs halls houses the experiments gerda , lvd , cresst , cuore , and the ultra low background hpge detector facility gator ( in the former gallex / gno counting house ) .",
    "the nai(tl ) detector was placed in front of the gator house main entrance , directly on the concrete floor ; data was taken for three days .",
    "hall b : this hall houses the large experiments icarus and warp .",
    "the detector was placed between the warp outer shield and the wall of the hall .",
    "again , the gamma flux was measured for three days .",
    "interferometer tunnel / xenon : the tunnels with smaller cross sections behind the main halls are connecting the large experimental areas and house the lngs interferometer . because of the increasing demand of underground space , the interferometer tunnel is nowadays also used for smaller experimental setups such as large , luna , pulex , and xenon and might be of interest for other experiments or underground r&d setups .",
    "as no background data was available for the interferometer tunnel , we performed a measurement close to the xenon100 experiment @xcite which is currently the dark matter experiment with the lowest background level .",
    "the gamma flux was measured for two days next to the xenon100 passive lead shield .",
    "lvd core facility : the lvd core facility ( lvd cf ) is the innermost part of the _ large volume detector _ which is also located in hall  a. lvd is an observatory mainly devoted to the study of neutrinos from core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "it has a highly modular structure , consisting of 1000  tons of liquid scintillator .",
    "the interest in the lvd cf was triggered by  @xcite who show that the muon flux in the cf , using lvd as a muon veto , is equivalent to a much deeper site .",
    "a flux of @xmath21  @xmath1s@xmath0 ( @xmath22  mev ) untagged muons is estimated for the lvd cf , a value which is comparable to snolab ( 6010  m.w.e . )  with a predicted flux of @xmath23  @xmath1s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the steel / scintillator structure is also expected to lower the gamma background considerably , hence the 3 \"  nai(tl ) detector was placed on top of the innermost lvd module , taking data for 10 days .",
    "the gamma spectra measured at the four locations are shown in fig .",
    "[ compare_all ] .",
    "while the flux in the halls of lngs and the interferometer tunnel are similar , it is almost two orders of magnitude lower inside the lvd  cf due to the shielding provided by the lvd modules .",
    "the low energetic peaks in the lvd  cf spectrum are from lead isotopes in the lvd steel structure .        for a measurement of low gamma fluxes ,",
    "it is essential to understand the intrinsic background of the detector itself .",
    "this has been measured underground at lngs , inside a low background lead shield purged with high purity boil off nitrogen gas in order to suppress the background from @xmath9rn .",
    "the measuring time was 26 days ; the result is also shown in fig .  [ compare_all ] .",
    "at the lowest energies , the intrinsic background spectrum is higher than the lvd  cf measurement .",
    "this is due to the 46.5  kev gamma line from @xmath24pb in the lead shielding .",
    "the setup used to measure the intrinsic background of the 3 ",
    "nai(tl ) detector , including electronics and shielding , has been modeled in a dedicated monte carlo simulation .",
    "the contributions from the primordial isotopes @xmath2u , @xmath3th , and @xmath4k to the intrinsic background were determined by comparing the simulation with the measured spectrum .",
    "the scaling factors @xmath25 for each chain @xmath26 were treated as free parameters in a @xmath27-minimization fit .",
    "taking into account the number of simulated events , the mass of the simulated material , and the measuring time , the individual activites @xmath28 can be calculated from @xmath25 .",
    "the simulation shows satisfactory agreement with the data and leads to the following results : ( @xmath29 )  bq / kg for @xmath2u , ( @xmath30 )  bq / kg for @xmath3th , and ( @xmath31 )  bq / kg for @xmath4k .",
    "taking into account the intrinsic efficiency of the crystal , the integrated gamma flux below 3000  kev can be calculated from the measurements at the different locations .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ fluxes_gamma_act ] , the errors consist of the statistical errors of the flux measurement , and the statistical and systematical error from the efficiency determination .",
    "the values for the halls  a and b and the interferometer tunnel are 2.53.5  times lower than the value quoted in @xcite for hall  c , and a factor 1.72.7  below the measurement of hall  a @xcite . in both references ,",
    "neither the exact position of the detector nor a detailed description of the measurement is given .",
    "the intrinsic radioactivity of the detector had to be taken into account in the analysis of the low flux in the lvd  cf leading to a larger relative uncertainty ; this contribution also causes the structures in the spectrum below 400  kev .",

    "neutrons constitute the most critical background for many experiments searching for rare processes as they are harder to shield than gamma rays .",
    "in some cases they can not be distinguished from signals , for example in experiments searching for nuclear recoils from wimp dark matter .",
    "the dominant sources of neutrons in underground laboratories are @xmath5 reactions on light elements ( c , o , f , na , mg , al , si ) , where the @xmath32-particle comes from the primoridal decay chains , and spontaneous fission , mainly of @xmath2u @xcite . because of the depth , the flux of high energetic neutrons ( @xmath33  mev ) induced by cosmic ray muons is 23  orders of magnitudes lower @xcite .",
    "the neutron flux from 010  mev in hall  a of lngs was found to be @xmath34 ( value from @xcite , using measurements from @xcite and @xcite ) ; for an overview on neutron background measurements in the lngs hall  a , cf .",

    ", we present an estimation of the neutron flux in the interferometer tunnel ( in front of the xenon building , location  3 ) using a 11   nai(tl ) detector .",
    "the application of this type of detector for neutron flux measurements has been reported before @xcite ; it exploits the capture of thermal neutrons on iodine : @xmath35 the reduction of environmental gamma background in the energy region around 6.8  mev allows to derive the integral neutron flux with this detectors by measuring the area of the gamma peak from the capture reaction . compared to other easily available detectors , using this large nai(tl ) crystal has the advantage of a sizeable area coverage and a massive active target in a compact geometry , which facilitates studies of the intrinsic background . at the same time , the nai(tl ) detector suffers from a rather low absorpton cross secton leading to a low efficiency , and some contamination from the gamma background .",
    "therefore , this kind of measurement can not compete with efforts using dedicated neutron counters @xcite such as @xmath36he or bf@xmath37 . in the absence of other data , however , it still provides important information on the overall neutron background level and can be used for cross checks with measurements performed at other locations .",
    "the nai(tl )  crystal has a diameter of 27.7  cm and a height of 33  cm .",
    "seven 3   pmts are coupled to one side of the crystal , however , only 6 pmts were operational during this measurement .",
    "the detector is enclosed in aluminum and the crystal is additionally surrounded by 5  cm of polyethylene for thermal insulation and neutron moderation .",
    "the analog signals of the 6  pmts are added using a linear fan - in , shaped with a spectroscopy amplifier , and recorded using a 8k  mca .",
    "energy calibration and resolution have been determined with standard gamma calibration sources .",
    "the resolution , measured at energies up to 2.6  mev , is 9% at 2  mev and extrapolated to be 5% at 7  mev .",
    "the energy threshold for the neutron measurements was then raised to about 2  mev , still well below the region of interest for neutron capture .",
    "the neutron detection efficiency was determined with a calibrated ambe neutron source , leading to @xmath38 .",
    "the spectrum of the ambe source covers the same energy range ( 010  mev ) as the expected underground neutron spectrum ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) with a slightly higher mean energy .",
    "the shape of the expected underground spectrum is also steeper .",
    "( the flux of muon induced neutrons is several orders of magnitude suppressed and can be neglected here . ) therefore , the calibrations with ambe might lead to a slight overestimation of the derived underground neutron flux .",
    "neutrons capture on @xmath39i does not only lead to a peak at 6.8  mev , but also to events at lower energies when only a fraction of the full gamma energy is absorbed in the crystal .",
    "elastic neutron scattering is only relevant at much lower energies .",
    "events from 710  mev are caused by gamma rays from neutron capture processes in other materials than the nai crystal @xcite .",

    "the high energetic gamma flux was measured for 37  days . in comparison to the ambe calibrations , the 6.8  mev peak from neutron capture is hardly visible due to the very low neutron rate and the overlap with high energetic gamma events from reactions outside the detector .",
