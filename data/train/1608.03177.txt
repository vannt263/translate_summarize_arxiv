    "they are used to answer questions as to how likely a link is between two species within a real network .",
    "does a network s characteristics result from a hidden biological mechanism , or , does it occur by chance in such networks ?",
    "one of the most common approaches is to compute an approximate sample with the use of a metropolis markov chain which is known as _",
    "swap chain _ or _",
    "switching chain_. in the swap chain , one has to apply @xmath10 times the following procedure ; either swap the ends of two non - adjacent edges if it is possible , or , stay in the current graph .",
    "it is not possible to swap the edge ends if there exists already one of the possible new generated edges . exchanging two edge ends can not change the vertex degrees of incident vertices , and hence generates a new graph with the same vertex degrees .",
    "we call such graphs _ realisations_. this approach is easy to implement , and the idea of swaps draws back to petersen  @xcite , in the 19th century .",
    "the swap chain itself was introduced by kannan et al . @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath10 of steps is called _ mixing time _ , and describes how well all realisations are mixed after @xmath10 steps .",
    "more precisely , the _ variation distance _ between the probability distribution at step @xmath10 , and the uniform distribution can not exceed a given @xmath11 , and depends on the instance size ( consider for more information the book of levin et al .",
    "+ however , it seems to be quite hard to prove a _ rapid mixing time _ for the swap chain , i.e. @xmath10 can be bounded by a polynomial which depends on the input size of the graph ( edge number , vertex number ) and @xmath11 .",
    "those upper bounds were proven for _ half - regular graphs _ and graphs with bounded vertex degrees see  @xcite . a bipartite graph",
    "@xmath12 is half - regular if the vertex degrees in @xmath13 or @xmath14 are identical .",
    "the general mixing time for the swap chain is still open , and the mixing times for the solved sub - classes are much too high to be applied . on the other hand ,",
    "approximate sampling of realisations was proven to be rapid .",
    "for that , one has to transform a realisation problem via the reduction of tutte  @xcite to a perfect matching problem .",
    "jerrum et al  @xcite , introduced a rapid mixing markov chain for sampling perfect matchings , and so for the realisation problem .",
    "this result was improved by bezkov et al  @xcite",
    ". however , all these polynomial bounds have only the theoretical value to show that there exists a polynomial approximate sampler .",
    "the exponents of these polynomials are much too high for any practical use .",
    "the reason seems to be a lack in our proving techniques .",
    "moreover , many people believe that the swap chain is quite fast .",
    "rechner et al  @xcite found some experimental evidence for this assumption .",
    "[ [ the - curveball - chain ] ] the curveball chain + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    is a complete new metropolis markov chain to generate approximate samples at random .",
    "the idea of strona et al  @xcite was to apply several swaps for edges of two vertices at the same time .",
    "they had the nice idea to map , in a bipartite graph @xmath15 one vertex set @xmath14 to some kids , and the other vertex set @xmath13 to baseball cards .",
    "edge set @xmath16 describes which cards are owned by which kid .",
    "a swap corresponds then to two kids , which exchange two cards , which they do not have in common .",
    "the natural question came up , why do they not change more cards at the same time .",
    "intuitively , this must mix all cards much faster .",
    "more formally , the curveball algorithm repeats the following steps @xmath10 times ; ( a ) choose two adjacency lists @xmath17 and @xmath18 uniform at random , ( b ) determine sets @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and choose a subset @xmath21 of @xmath22 of size @xmath23 at random , denote the remaining subset by @xmath24 ( c ) replace @xmath25 in @xmath17 by @xmath21 , and @xmath20 in @xmath18 by @xmath26 step ( c ) is called _ trade _ , and can correspond to a swap if @xmath25 and @xmath21 only differ in one element .",
    "carstens  @xcite proved that this algorithm samples a realisation uniform at random if @xmath27 the theoretical status of the mixing times in the curveball chain is open .",
    "nevertheless , the proving techniques seem to work even worse for proving rapid mixing time than in the swap chain . on the other hand the curveball algorithm seems to mix much faster in experiments of strona et al than the swap chain  @xcite .",
    "please observe that this new algorithm can apply exponentially many possible trades on one realisation whereas the swap chain can only use polynomially many swaps in one realisation .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that more realisations can be achieved in less steps of the curveball algorithm .",
    "+ independently , a similar approach was proposed by verhelst  @xcite . in his paper",
    ", the curveball algorithm is described briefly ( in a complicated way ) as an extension of his non - uniform sampling algorithm .",
    "however , no proof for its correctness is given .",
    "instead , he proposes a metropolis - hasting version which basically avoids to consider adjacency list pairs where no trade is possible .",
    "intuitively , this approach leads to a smaller mixing time than the curveball algorithm because one has to stay in a current realisation less frequently . on the other hand",
    "the asymptotic complexity of one step in verhelst s algorithm is much higher than in the curveball algorithm .",
    "it is questionable ( or unclear ) if the smaller mixing time can balance out the calculation effort for one step . in our paper",
    "we focus on the curveball algorithm .",
    "+ we do not want to focus in this paper on the problem to determine good upper bounds for the mixing time .",
    "instead , we consider an extension of the problem .",
    "consider for example a plant - pollinator network describing which pollinator pollinates which plant . then it is clear that some edges can never occur because a bee is to large for a flower , or , their activity time periods are different .",
    "hence , a more realistic null model would fix some non - edges and edges in a given realisation , and only search for random samples in this subclass of graphs .    [",

    "swapping of alternating cycles with shorter length than @xmath449 delivers a sampling algorithm . if this algorithm can be applied depends on the size of @xmath53 and the size of realisations .",
    "we propose in future work to do a lot of experimental work . whereas we can not answer how efficient these methods work for sampling @xmath202-fixed realisations in theory",
    ", we should find out in experiments if several metrics which were proposed for stopping rules see  @xcite converge slower or faster than for the corresponding realisation problem without the fixed set @xmath0 of edges and non - edges .",
    "it is also interesting to find out how sets @xmath202 look like in real world applications to see how far we come in practice with these new algorithms",
    ". it could be also interesting to develop heuristics for special graph classes , and sequences in @xmath450 .",
