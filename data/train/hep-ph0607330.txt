    "the see - saw mechanism @xcite is a simple and elegant way to understand neutrino masses and their lightness compared to all other fermions . at the same time , with leptogenesis @xcite , the see - saw offers an attractive model to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe . the asymmetry is produced in the decays of the very heavy rh neutrinos , necessary for the see - saw mechanism to work , generating a @xmath4 asymmetry in the form of a lepton asymmetry partly converted into a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes if temperatures are larger than about @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "calculations have been typically performed within a one - flavor approximation , assuming that the final total @xmath4 asymmetry is not sensitive to the dynamics of the individual @xmath6 asymmetries . in this case",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that current neutrino mixing data favor leptogenesis to lie in a region of the parameter space where thermal equilibrium sets up prior to the freeze - out of the final asymmetry and therefore , if the temperature of the early universe is large enough , the final asymmetry does not depend on the initial conditions .    for a hierarchical heavy neutrino spectrum ,",
    "successful leptogenesis requires the mass of the lightest @xcite or of the next - to - lightest @xcite rh neutrino to be large enough , if the rh neutrino production occurs through scatterings in the thermal plasma . in this case",
    "there is also an associated lower bound on the initial temperature of the radiation - dominated regime in the early universe , to be identified with the reheating temperature , @xmath7 , within inflation .",
    "being independent of the initial conditions , these bounds are particularly relevant , since they appear as an intrinsic feature of leptogenesis .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that flavor effects can strongly modify leptogenesis predictions @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate how the dependence on the initial conditions and the lower bounds on the rh neutrino masses and on the reheating temperature are modified when flavor effects are included .",
    "we show that the usually quoted values do not get relaxed , contrarily to what has been stated in @xcite .",
    "the calculations are presented within the hierarchical limit for the spectrum of the heavy neutrino masses , and more specifically in the lightest rh neutrino dominated scenario ( @xmath8ds ) , where the final asymmetry is dominantly produced by the lightest rh neutrino decays . in the second section we set up the notation and the kinetic equations . in the third section",
    "we analyze how flavor effects modify the dependence on the initial conditions . in the fourth section",
    "we perform explicit calculations for a specific but significant example . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the role of @xmath9 scatterings , showing how they introduce just a correction to the results .",
    "adding to the standard model lagrangian three rh neutrinos with a yukawa coupling matrix @xmath10 and a majorana mass matrix @xmath11 , a neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath12 is generated , after electro - weak symmetry breaking , by the vev @xmath13 of the higgs boson . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the neutrino mass spectrum splits into 3 heavy majorana states @xmath8 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 with masses @xmath17 , almost coinciding with the eigenvalues of @xmath11 , and 3 light majorana states with masses @xmath18 , corresponding to the eigenvalues of the neutrino mass matrix given by the see - saw formula , [ seesaw ] m_=-m_d1mm_d^t .",
    "neutrino mixing experiments measure two mass - squared differences . in normal ( inverted ) neutrino schemes , one has m^2_3-m^2_2= m^2_atm(m_sol^2 ) , m^2_2-m^2_1= m^2_sol ( m_atm^2-m^2_sol ) . for @xmath19 ,",
    "one has a quasi - degenerate spectrum with @xmath20 , whereas for @xmath21 one has a fully hierarchical ( normal or inverted ) spectrum .",
    "a lepton asymmetry can be generated from the decays of the heavy neutrinos into leptons and higgs bosons and partly converted into a baryon asymmetry by the sphaleron ( @xmath4 conserving ) processes at temperatures higher than about @xmath5 .    for @xmath22 , tauon",
    "charged lepton yukawa interactions are in equilibrium  @xcite and typically faster than inverse processes @xcite , breaking the coherent evolution of the lepton doublets quantum states , the @xmath23 s , produced in rh neutrino decays .",
    "the quantum state is projected on a two - flavor basis , where the eigenstates are given by the tauon flavor and by a linear combination of muon and electron flavors . for @xmath24",
    "both muon and tauon charged lepton yukawa interactions are strong enough that the quantum state is projected on a three - flavor basis .",
    "flavor effects play a double role in leptogenesis .",
    "a first effect is that the wash - out is reduced .",
    "this happens because , in the inverse decays , the higgs do not interact with @xmath25 s but with the flavor eigenstates @xmath26 s , with a reduced inverse decay rate . this effect can be accounted for introducing the flavor projectors @xcite p_i & = & |l_i|l_|^2 = _ i_i , + _ i & = & ||l_i|_|^2 = _ i_i , ( i=1,2,3 ; = e , , ) where @xmath27 is the partial decay rate of the process @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the total decay rate , such that @xmath30 .",

    "a rigorous description of the asymmetry evolution has then to be performed in terms of the individual flavor asymmetries @xmath35 rather than in terms of the total asymmetry @xmath36 , as usually done in the one - flavor approximation . the contribution of each decay to the @xmath37 s",

    "there has been an intense study of the relevant processes in leptogenesis @xcite . for our purposes it will be enough to describe",
    "the evolution of the asymmetries just in terms of decays and inverse decays ( after subtraction of the real intermediate state contribution from @xmath46 processes ) neglecting @xmath9 scatterings and thermal effects . in the appendix",
    "we will discuss and justify this approximation .",
    "we will also neglect off - shell @xmath46 and @xmath47 processes , relevant only at higher temperatures , and spectator processes that produce corrections not larger than @xmath48 , within the precision needed for our purposes @xcite .",

    "we will moreover assume no rotation in the plane 23 , i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "under these conditions both the total @xmath38 asymmetries @xmath92 and @xmath93 are suppressed @xmath94 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , under particular conditions , the @xmath95 s and the @xmath96 s are not suppressed and do not vanish .",
    "this can potentially lead to a scenario where the final asymmetry is produced by the decays of the two heavier rh neutrinos if @xmath97 such that the flavored regime applies .",
    "here we do not pursue this possibility and focus on a typical @xmath8-dominated scenario where the dominant contribution to the final asymmetry comes from the decays of the lightest rh neutrino and [ nbml ] n_b - l^f__1_1^f .",

    "the existence of an upper bound on the quantity @xmath105 independent of @xmath106 , imply , as in the case of one - flavor approximation , the existence of a lower bound on @xmath106 given by [ lbm1 ] m_1 m_1^min 16v^23 _ b^cmb / m_atm ^f_1(k_1)_1(k_1 ) ( 3 ) , where we indicated with @xmath107 the efficiency factor in the usual one - flavor approximation , corresponding to @xmath84 with @xmath108 .",

    "the first is the thermalization of the @xmath8 abundance , such that , for an arbitrary initial abundance one has @xmath129 .",

    "more quantitatively , it is useful to introduce a value @xmath131 such that , for @xmath132 , the final asymmetry calculated for initial thermal abundance differs from that one calculated for vanishing initial abundance by less than some quantity @xmath133 .",
    "this can be used as a precise definition of the strong wash - out regime .",
    "let us consider some particular cases , showing how flavor effects tend to enlarge the domain of the weak wash - out at the expense of the strong wash - out regime .",
    "the simplest situation is the alignment case , realized when the @xmath8 s decay just into one - flavor @xmath134 , such that @xmath135 and @xmath136 , implying @xmath137 .",
    "notice that we do not have to worry about the fact that the lightest rh neutrino inverse decays might not be able to wash - out the asymmetry generated from the decays of the two heavier ones , since we are assuming negligible @xmath138 and @xmath139 anyway . in this case",

    "has @xmath140 .    in the considered case of alignment , one obtains @xmath141 for @xmath142 , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath131 plays a relevant role since only for @xmath143 one has leptogenesis predictions on the final baryon asymmetry resulting from a self - contained set of assumptions . on the other hand for @xmath144 leptogenesis",
    "has to be complemented with a model for the initial conditions .",
    "in addition to that , one has to say that in the weak wash - out regime the calculation of the final asymmetry requires a precise description of the rh neutrino production , potentially sensitive to many poorly known effects .",
    "it is then interesting that current neutrino mixing data favor @xmath1 to be in the range @xmath145 @xcite , where one can have a mild wash - out assuring full independence of the initial condition , as one can see in fig . 1 , but still successful leptogenesis . in this case",
    "one can place constraints on the see - saw parameters not depending on specific assumptions for the initial conditions and with reduced theoretical uncertainties .    since one has @xmath146 , the general lower bound on @xmath106 ( see eq .",
    "( [ lbm1 ] ) ) , like all other quantities , becomes the usual lower bound holding in the one - flavor approximation . in the right panel of fig .",
    "1 we have plotted it both for @xmath113 and @xmath115 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath84 dependence on the initial conditions translates into a dependence of @xmath147 .",
    "the lowest model - independent values are then obtained for @xmath148 and are given by m_1310 ^ 9gev t_reh1.510 ^ 9gev .",
    "another typically quoted lower bound on @xmath106 is obtained for initial thermal abundance in the limit @xmath149 , given by @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss another possibility and for definiteness let us first consider the three - flavor regime .",
    "we will easily extend the results to the two - flavor regime .",
    "let us assume that @xmath151 for any @xmath134 and consequently @xmath152 .",
    "this case was also considered in @xcite . from the eq.s ( [ ef ] )",
    "it follows that the three @xmath84 , like also the three @xmath153 , are all equal and thus the eq .",
    "( [ nbml ] ) simplifies into @xmath154 , as in the usual one - flavor approximation .",
    "however now the wash - out is reduced by the presence of the projector , such that @xmath155 .",
    "the result is that in the case of an initial thermal abundance the efficiency factor , as a function of @xmath1 , is simply shifted .",
    "the same happens for vanishing initial abundance in the strong wash - out regime .",
    "however , in the weak wash - out regime , there is not a simple shift , since the rh neutrino production is still depending on @xmath1 .",
    "a plot of @xmath84 is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "one can see how the reduced wash - out increases the value of @xmath131 to @xmath156 , approximately @xmath157 larger , thus compensating almost exactly the wash - out reduction by a factor @xmath158 ( cf .",
    "( [ plaw ] ) ) .    in this way",
    "the lowest bounds on @xmath106 in the strong wash - out regime , at @xmath159 , are almost unchanged . on the other hand for a given value of @xmath160",

    "notice that also the lower bound at @xmath149 for initial thermal abundance does not change .",
    "more generally , flavor effects simply induce a shift of the dependence of the lower bound on @xmath1 .",
    "the semi - democratic case is intermediate between the democratic and the alignment cases .",
    "it is obtained when one projector vanishes , for example @xmath162 , and the other two are one half and in this case @xmath163 .",
    "the corresponding plot of the efficiency factor and of the lower bound on @xmath106 are also shown in fig .",
    "1 ( short - dashed lines ) .",
    "these results for the semi - democratic case also apply to the two - flavor regime , when the two projectors are equal , namely @xmath164 .",
    "there is another potentially interesting situation that motivates an extension of the previous results to arbitrarily small values of @xmath165 .",
    "this occurs when the final asymmetry is dominated by one flavor @xmath134 and the eq .",
    "( [ nbml ] ) can be further simplified into n_b - l^f_1_1^f , analogously to the alignment case but with @xmath166 .",

    "( [ bound ] ) , much larger than the other two strongly suppressed , simply because one has @xmath167 .",
    "one has then to imagine a situation where the @xmath38 asymmetry @xmath90 is comparable to the sum of the other two but @xmath168 such that @xmath169 .",
    "the dominance is then a result of the much weaker wash - out .",
    "the analysis of the dependence on the initial conditions can then be again performed as in the previous cases calculating the value of @xmath131 for any value of @xmath165 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "the alignment case corresponds to @xmath170 , the semi - democratic case to @xmath171 and the democratic case to @xmath172 . notice that the result is very close to the simple estimation @xmath173",

    "3 we have plotted the values of the lower bounds on @xmath106 and @xmath7 for light hierarchical neutrinos , implying @xmath174 in the eq . ( [ bound ] ) . these can be obtained plugging @xmath175 in the eq .",

    "there are two possible ways to look at the results . as a function of @xmath176",
    "they get more stringent when @xmath177 decreases so that the minimum is obtained in the alignment case , corresponding to the unflavored case .",
    "this is clearly visible in the left panel of fig .",
    "3 . therefore",
    ", one can conclude that flavor effects can not help to alleviate the conflict of the leptogenesis lower bound on the reheating temperature with the gravitino problem upper bound . on the other hand",

    "if we first consider the case of fully hierarchical light neutrinos , @xmath189 , then p^0_1=_1_1=|u_3|^2 = 0 . neglecting the effect of the running of neutrino parameters from high energy to low energy @xcite , one can assume that the @xmath76 matrix can be identified with the pmns matrix as measured by neutrino mixing experiments .",
    "we will adopt the parametrization @xcite @xmath190 where @xmath191 , @xmath192 and where we have used @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "one then finds p^0_1e0.03 , p^0_1p^0_11/2 .",
    "this result implies a situation where the projector on the electron flavor is very small and the associated generated asymmetry as well , while the muon and tauon contributions are equal .",
    "notice that even though there is a non - vanishing extra contribution to the muon and tauon @xmath38 asymmetries , they have equal absolute value but opposite sign .",
    "therefore , since the projectors are equal as well , summing the kinetic equations ( [ flke ] ) over @xmath134 , one simply recovers the one - flavor approximation with the wash - out reduced by a factor @xmath196 .",
    "this is a realization of the semi - democratic case that we were envisaging at the end of 3.2 where @xmath197 . in this situation flavor effects",
    "do not produce large modifications of the usual results , essentially a factor 2 reduction of the wash - out in the strong wash - out regime with a consequent equal relaxation of the lower bounds ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "moreover there is practically no difference between a calculation in the two or in the three - flavor regime .",
    "let us now consider the effect of a non - vanishing but small lightest neutrino mass @xmath104 , for example @xmath198 . in this case the results can also depend on the majorana and dirac phases .",
    "we will show the results for @xmath199 purely imaginary , the second condition that maximizes the total @xmath38 asymmetry if @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "notice that this is not in general the condition that maximizes @xmath111 for non - vanishing @xmath104 , however we have checked that allowing for a real part of @xmath201 one obtains similar bounds within a factor @xmath202 if @xmath200 .",
    "we have first considered the case of a real @xmath76 .",
    "the results are only slightly sensitive to a variation of @xmath3 within the experimentally allowed range @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , we have set @xmath204 , corresponding to @xmath205 , in all the shown examples . in the left panel of fig . 4    we show the values of the projectors , the @xmath177 s , and of the @xmath111 s as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations are performed in the two - flavor regime since we obtain that successful leptogenesis is possible only for @xmath206 , where the two - flavor regime applies .",
    "now a difference between the tauon and the sum of the muon and electron projectors and asymmetries arises . on the other hand for @xmath207 this difference tends to vanish and",
    "the semi - democratic case is recovered again .    in the central panel",
    "we have also plotted the quantities @xmath208 ( cf .",
    "( [ xi1a ] ) ) and their sum @xmath110 , where we recall that @xmath110 gives the deviation of the total asymmetry from a calculation in the one - flavor approximation for hierarchical light neutrinos .",
    "one can see how now the contribution to the total asymmetry from the tauon flavor can be twice as large as from the electron plus muon flavor .",
    "for @xmath207 the semi - democratic case is restored , the two contributions tend to be equal to the one - flavor approximation case and the total final asymmetry is about twice larger . finally in the right panel",
    "we have plotted the lower bound on @xmath106 and compared them with the results in the one - flavor approximation ( dash - dotted line ) . at @xmath209",
    "the relaxation is maximum , a factor @xmath210 . for @xmath160 the relaxation",
    "is reduced to a factor @xmath196 , as in the semi - democratic case .",
    "let us now study the effect of switching on phases in the @xmath76 matrix , again for @xmath198 .",
    "the most important effect arises from one of the two majorana phases , @xmath211 . in fig .",
    "5 we have then again plotted , in three panels , the same quantities as in fig . 4 for @xmath212 .    one can see how this further increases the difference between the @xmath53 and the @xmath213 contributions and further relaxes the lower bound on @xmath106 .",
    "the effect is small for the considered value @xmath214 .",
    "however , considering a much larger value while keeping @xmath212 , the effect becomes dramatically bigger . in fig .",
    "6 we have plotted the same quantities as in fig . 4 and fig . 5 for @xmath215 .    in the left panel",
    "one can see that now , for @xmath216 , @xmath217 , much larger than in the previous case .",
    "this means that the dominant contribution to the flavored @xmath38 asymmetries comes now from the @xmath218 term . at the same time ,",
    "very importantly , @xmath219 and in this way , as one can see in the central panel , the dominant contribution to @xmath110 is given by @xmath220 .",
    "this case thus finally realizes a one - flavor dominance case .",
    "the final effect is that the lower bound on @xmath106 is about one and half order of magnitude relaxed compared to the one - flavor approximation .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "7 we have summarized the dependence on @xmath221 of the lower bound on @xmath106 , plotting both the case with zero majorana phase and the case with @xmath212 .",
    "one can notice how the the effect of the phase in relaxing the lower bound increases with @xmath221 .",
    "finally we wanted to study the interesting case of a real orthogonal matrix @xmath68 , implying @xmath222 . if @xmath189 there is practically no produced asymmetry , since the @xmath223 .",
    "for a non - vanishing @xmath104 and a non - real @xmath76 however the @xmath224 and consequently @xmath225 . in fig .",
    "8 we have shown the results for @xmath214 and @xmath226 .",
    "we have again plotted the same quantities as in fig . 4 , 5 and 6 in three different panels .",
    "one can see that an asymmetry can be still produced , as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "however , successful leptogenesis is possible almost only in the weak wash - out regime . in the strong wash - out regime , for values @xmath227",
    ", there is a very small allowed region only for @xmath228 .",
    "this somehow means that , at least in the example we are considering and for small @xmath104 , flavor effects give a sub - dominant effect .",
    "we can thus draw two remarkable conclusions .",
    "the first is that the relaxation of the lower bounds compared to the one - flavor approximation is only @xmath202 for @xmath200 but grows up to one order of magnitude and more for @xmath229 , in the quasi - degenerate case .",
    "therefore , when flavor effects are taken into account , one obtains an opposite result compared to the one - flavor approximation where one has a suppression of the final asymmetry for growing absolute neutrino mass scale , leading to a stringent upper bound @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "this upper bound seems now to hold only for @xmath231 @xcite .",
    "notice however that a conclusive answer to this issue requires a full quantum kinetic calculation describing the evolution of the density matrices of leptons and anti - leptons @xcite .",
    "the second is that , when flavor effects are included , leptogenesis is an interesting example of phenomenology , beyond @xmath232 , where majorana phases can play a relevant role .",
    "it must be said however that if the stringent cosmological upper bounds on the absolute neutrino mass scale will be confirmed , @xmath233 @xcite , then flavor effects can only produce a @xmath202 relaxation of the lower bound on @xmath106 at large values of @xmath1 , compared to the results from the one - flavor approximation .",
    "this conclusion rigorously applies to the considered example but we arrived to the same conclusions also in other cases and it seems quite reasonable that this result holds on more general grounds .",
    "the reason is that for small @xmath200 it does not seem possible to realize a one - flavor dominated scenario .",
    "further studies are however needed on this point .",
    "flavor effects in leptogenesis can produce significant deviations from the usual results obtained within the one - flavor approximation .",
    "however , these are quite restricted in the strong wash - out regime , imposing that the final asymmetry is unambiguously determined for different choices of the initial conditions .",
    "the traditional lowest bounds on @xmath106 and @xmath7 are essentially the same as in the one - flavor approximation .",
    "therefore , flavor effects do not help to solve the conflict with the upper bound on the reheating temperature coming from the gravitino problem .",
    "for this purpose it is necessary to go beyond a hierarchical heavy neutrino spectrum @xcite .    on the other hand , for a fixed value of the decay parameter @xmath1",
    ", the lower bounds can be relaxed if it is possible to explain the observed asymmetry as dominantly produced in one flavor .",
    "this scenario seems not easily achievable since typically for low values of the projector , the final associated asymmetry is also lower .",
    "an interesting feature of flavor effects is that they depend in general on the low energy parameters @xcite , in particular on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath104 and on the phases in the neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "we have studied an interesting example assuming the conditions for maximal total @xmath38 asymmetry .",
    "we showed that for vanishing phases and lightest neutrino mass one essentially recovers the one - flavor approximation just with halved wash - out , the semi - democratic case , where the electron flavor gives a negligible contribution while the final asymmetry is equally shared between the muon and the tauon flavor contributions .",
    "however , switching on simultaneously a non - vanishing lightest neutrino mass and majorana phases , lead to an enhancement of the @xmath38 asymmetry in the tauon flavor . in this way a tauon - flavor dominated picture is realized , where the wash - out is much lower compared to the case when flavor effects are neglected . it is then quite interesting that there is an emerging interplay between future low energy experiments and flavored leptogenesis predictions on the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .    * acknowledgments * + it is a pleasure to thank m.  plmacher and g.  raffelt for useful comments and discussions .",
    "* note added * + during the revision of the paper , the work @xcite was completed , finding a more restrictive condition for the importance of flavor effects and for the validity of the eq.s ( [ flke ] ) .",
    "the condition is particularly restrictive in the case of one - flavor dominance , relevant for the results presented in figures 6 and 7 and for the possibility of circumventing the upper bound on the neutrino masses holding in the unflavored case .",
    "we should then warn the reader that these results need to be confirmed by a more general quantum kinetic analysis .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the effects of @xmath9 scatterings @xcite on the determination of the efficiency factors @xmath84 and more particularly on @xmath131 .",
    "it has been recently noticed that scatterings also contribute to the @xmath38 violating source term with the same @xmath38 asymmetries @xmath54 associated to inverse decays @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we also want to discuss the effect of this term extending the analytic procedure of @xcite , where it was not included .",
    "including scatterings the kinetic equations ( [ flke ] ) in the @xmath8ds get modified as [ flavors ] dn_n_1dz & = & -(d_1+s_1)(n_n_1-n_n_1^eq ) + dn__dz & = & _ 1(d_1+s_1)(n_n_1-n_n_1^eq ) -p_1 ^ 0(w_1^id+w_1^s)n _ _ .",
    "the notation is the same as in @xcite , except that here we are keeping the index referring to the lightest rh neutrino . defining j_1(z)1+s_1d_1 , the expression ( [ k1a ] ) for @xmath84 in the case of initial thermal abundance ( @xmath113 )",
    "gets generalized as [ k1aj ] ( k_1 ) ( 1-e^-k_1 z_b(k_1)j_1(z_b)2 ) . comparing with the result",
    "obtained when scatterings are neglected in the @xmath38 violating term , there is now @xmath234 instead of @xmath235 , making the effect of scatterings even less important than it was already .",
    "this could be relevant in the case of a dynamically generated abundance in the weak wash - out regime , since scatterings are able to produce a larger abundance at the decay time .",
    "however again , when the effect of scatterings is included in the @xmath38 violating term as well , this enhancing effect is greatly reduced .",
    "( [ k- ] ) for @xmath236 , when scatterings are included , becomes indeed _",
    "-^f(k_1,p_1 ^ 0)-2p_1 ^ 0  e^-n_s(k_1)2 ( e^p_1 ^ 02_s(k_1 ) - 1 ) , where @xmath237 the expression ( [ k+ ] ) for @xmath238 remains formally unchanged , but now @xmath239 has to be calculated replacing @xmath240 with @xmath241 into the eq .",
    "( [ nka ] ) . even without specifying at all the scattering term @xmath242",
    ", there is quite an interesting general feature resulting from the inclusion of scatterings in the @xmath38 violating term .",
    "one can indeed calculate the behavior of @xmath243 for @xmath149 discovering that @xcite [ k2 ] _ 1 p_1 ^ 0 ^2 k_1 ^ 2 , exactly as in the case when",
    "scatterings are neglected @xcite , except for the modified @xmath128 .",
    "the reason is that now there is a proportionality between asymmetry generation and neutrino production both in scatterings and in inverse decays .",
    "conversely , when scatterings are neglected in the @xmath38 violating term , there is an overproduction of neutrinos due to scatterings not compensated by an equal ( negative ) production of asymmetry , such that scatterings enhance the final asymmetry that is @xmath244 instead of @xmath245 .",
    "notice however that in the strong wash - out regime there is practically no difference .",
    "this approximation works well when scatterings involving gauge bosons and thermal effects @xcite are neglected .",
    "the different curves are obtained for @xmath249 and @xmath250 and compared with the case when scatterings are neglected ( solid lines ) .",
    "notice that the chosen values for @xmath251 are the same as in @xcite .",
    "a comparison shows that the results exhibit now a greatly reduced model dependence , here illustrated by the different values of @xmath251 , also in the weak wash - out regime . including thermal effects and scatterings involving gauge bosons",
    "would yield similar results .    in conclusion , the inclusion of scatterings in the @xmath38 violating terms greatly reduces the theoretical uncertainties in the weak wash - out regime , even though these are still much larger than in the strong wash - out regime . in particular",
    "the asymptotic behavior @xmath252 at small @xmath253 is a robust feature , as explained by the eq .",
    "( [ k2 ] ) . in the right panel",
    "we have shown the corresponding value of @xmath131 .",
    "notice that thermal effects are approximately reproduced by a thermal higgs mass @xmath254 @xcite and in the strong wash - out regime this is approximately equivalent to the case @xmath255 where scatterings produce just a correction in the calculation of @xmath131 . even for larger @xmath251",
    "the value of @xmath131 calculated neglecting scatterings is within the precision needed for the results of the paper , thus justifying the approximation to neglect scatterings .",
