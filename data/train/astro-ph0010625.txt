    "the mechanical luminosity of an agn jet of cross - sectional area @xmath0 with lorentz factor @xmath1 , containing jet - frame ( primed variables ) matter density density @xmath2 , energy density @xmath3 and pressure @xmath4 is given by @xmath5.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see e.g. leahy 1991 ) . to calculate the total jet luminosity @xmath6 , measured in the rest frame of the galaxy , we adapt the formulae of bicknell ( 1994 ) and bicknell & dopita ( 1997 ) , given for the synchrotron self - compton model , to apply for the case of proton blazar models . in this paper",
    "we shall apply the formula adapted for proton blazar models to a synchrotron proton blazar ( spb ) model for markarian 501 described by mcke & protheroe ( 2000 ) .",
    "in proton blazar models , the high energy part of the sed is due to interaction of protons accelerated along with electrons in the agn jet .",
    "the interactions are pion photoproduction on either low energy photons of the low energy part of the sed produced as synchrotron radiation by electrons in the jet ( e.g. mannheim 1993 ) , or on direct or scattered uv bump radiation from an accretion disk ( e.g. protheroe 1997 ) , and direct synchrotron emission by protons , muons and charged pions ( e.g. mcke & protheroe 2000 ) . to accelerate protons to sufficiently high energies that they can produce the high energy part of the sed",
    ", a large magnetic field is required .",
    "proton blazars would contain relativistic plasma of electrons and protons , and a non - negligible magnetic field . for a @xmath7 power - law ( @xmath8 ) for the jet - frame number density of electrons , the total number density of ( relativistic ) electrons is @xmath9 , and the energy density of ( relativistic ) electrons is @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , for a @xmath11 power - law ( @xmath12 ) for the jet - frame number density of protons , the total number density of ( relativistic ) protons is @xmath13 , and the energy density of ( relativistic ) protons is @xmath14 , giving @xmath15 assuming that the number of relativistic electrons will be greater than the number of relativistic protons , and applying charge conservation , i.e. the number of ` cold ' ( non - relativistic ) protons equals the number of ` hot ' ( relativistic ) electrons minus the number of hot protons , one obtains @xmath16\\\\ &   & = 4p_p'\\gamma^2 \\beta c a\\left[\\chi_p { ( \\gamma-1)\\over\\gamma } + 1 + { p_b'\\over p_p'}+ { p_e'\\over p_p ' } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since for a tangled magnetic field @xmath17 , and where @xmath18 we now consider how to apply these formulae to proton blazar models .",
    "first , consider the radiation efficiency of protons which depends on their effective energy loss rates @xmath19 for synchrotron radiation ( syn ) , photoproduction leading to electromagnetic radiation ( em ) or anything ( any ) , and adiabatic losses ( adiab ) , @xmath20 averaging over the input _ energy _ spectrum gives the total radiation efficiency @xmath21 for electrons , we assume the radiation efficiency to be @xmath22 .",
    "if we assume that the low energy part of the observed sed is due to electrons , and the high energy part is due to protons , then we may infer values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 directly from the observed bolometric flux in the two parts of the sed for an assumed doppler parameter and emission region size .",
    "the bolometric luminosities for the two parts of the sed ( in any frame since they are lorentz invariant ) are then @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these bolometric luminosities are related to the observed bolometric fluxes ( corrected for relativistic beaming ) from the two parts of the sed by @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29^{-1}$ ] the doppler factor and @xmath30 the source s luminosity distance .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32/3 $ ] , and @xmath33",
    "we use these formula to estimate the total jet power of mrk 501 during its 1997 flare to be @xmath34  erg/ s , and find the contributions to the total jet power of cold protons , magnetic field , and accelerated electrons , relative to that of accelerated protons .",
    "1 shows the dependence of the total jet luminosity on the doppler factor @xmath35 for a fixed variability time scale @xmath36  hours , and with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and a target photon density appropriate to mrk  501 during flaring .",
    "clearly visible is the fact that in hadronic models the proton kinetic energy and the poynting flux dominate the total jet luminosity , while the electron kinetic energy is only of minor importance . at high doppler factors",
    "the emission region becomes so large that one needs only relatively small magnetic fields and proton densities to fit the observations .",
    "in addition , adiabatic losses become small resulting in a decrease of the required kinetic proton luminosity . for example , @xmath39  g and @xmath40  @xmath41 are sufficient to fit the mrk  501 flare for @xmath42 , while for @xmath43 magnetic fields of over 30  g and proton densities of @xmath44  @xmath41 are needed .",
    "the total jet luminosity exhibits a minimum of @xmath34erg / s at @xmath45 .    in the framework of the jet  disk symbiosis ( e.g. falcke & biermann 1995 ) , the jet luminosity should not exceed the total accretion power @xmath46 for the equilibrium state .",
    "accretion theory relates the disk luminosity to the accretion power .",
    "page & thorne ( 1974 ) give @xmath47 .",
    "disk luminosities for ` typical ' radio - loud agn lie in the range @xmath48  erg / s with bl  lac objects tending to the lower end on average .",
    "specifically , for mrk  501 there are no emission line measurements available , and this complicates the evaluation of its disk luminosity . however , any observed uv - emission in the flaring stage may put an upper limit on it .",
    "historical data give @xmath49  erg / s ( mufson et al 1984 , pian et al 1998 ) , and we obtain for the accretion power , @xmath50  erg / s , at least a factor 5 below the value necessary to comply with the constraint of the disk  jet symbiosis .",
    "note , however , that the estimate of @xmath46 is based on archival non - flaring data from mrk  501 , and we could speculate that either the disk has pushed more energy into the jet during tev - flaring , or that the flaring stage can not be considered as a steady state . also , accretion theory might predict larger conversion efficiencies of the accretion power into disk radiation than actually might occur in bl  lac objects ."
