    "the leading progenitor models for short duration gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) are merging compact binaries ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * ) consisting of either two neutron stars ( nss ) @xcite or a black hole ( bh ) with a ns companion @xcite .",
    "observations of sgrb host galaxies are broadly consistent with the expected host morphologies , offsets , and delay time distributions of compact mergers @xcite , and the recent discovery of an r  process powered kilonova @xcite associated with grb130603b has given further credence to this model @xcite .",
    "compact binaries are expected to receive large  natal kicks \" due to asymmetries manifested by the mechanisms of ns / bh formation , resulting in mean velocities of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 for ns / ns binaries and @xmath3 km s@xmath2 for ns / bh binaries @xcite . kicks of these magnitudes imply that compact binaries quickly leave behind their formation site , and often reach large distances from their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "it was therefore anticipated that compact binary mergers would commonly occur in constant low density media characteristic of interstellar or intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "the interaction between an ultra - relativistic blastwave and its surrounding medium was predicted to produce a dim and smooth afterglow in a broad range of wavelengths shortly following the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "observations have shown , however , that the onset of the afterglow emission can sometimes be postponed from tens to hundreds of seconds following the prompt emission .",
    "in addition , some events have exhibited an abrupt turn - off to a rapid fading in the afterglow lightcurve at late times @xcite .",
    "these facts have currently been interpreted as arising from late time energy injection via the formation of a long lived central engine at the merger site @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we offer an alternative explanation . as noted above , it has long been known that the afterglow properties depend heavily on the conditions of the circumburst medium .",
    "if a sgrb progenitor hosts a pulsar , then a poynting flux dominated cavity will form in its vicinity . for a compact binary system with a center of mass velocity exceeding a few tens of kilometers per second ,",
    "this evacuated structure will manifest itself as a bow - shock cavity in which a massive thin shell separates the circumbinary medium from the interstellar medium .",
    "if this bubble grows to sufficiently large size , then the deceleration of the sgrb jet , and thus the onset of the afterglow , will be significantly delayed .",
    "additionally , should the shock deceleration occur predominantly within the bow - shock thin shell , the afterglow is predicted to quickly fade . in this way , we can account for some of the diversity of observed afterglow behaviors without invoking the existence of a long lived central engine . in section [ sec : cav ] we describe the conditions necessary for the production of large bow - shock cavities in systems hosting pulsars . in section [ sec : aft ]",
    "we derive the observational implications for sgrbs , present relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of the sgrb jet propagation taking place within such pulsar bow - shock cavities , and compare with observed data .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : dis ] we summarize our results and discuss their implications for sgrbs arising from neutron star mergers hosting pulsars .",
    "a binary with a pulsar companion with isotropic luminosity @xmath4 , traveling through some medium of density @xmath5 with velocity @xmath6 will form a bow - shock with characteristic size @xmath7 given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the external particle density .",
    "this length scale , called the standoff length , has been shown to be in reasonable agreement with mhd calculations of the shock structure even when the luminosity is anisotropic and nonaxisymmetric ( see fig . [",
    "fig : diag ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "equation [ eq : rbow ] becomes exact in the limit of efficient cooling , but realistic systems form a thin shell of width @xmath12 between the bow - shock and an inner contact discontinuity ( fig .   [",
    "fig : diag ] ) .    for a merging binary with at least one pulsar ,",
    "there are two channels of luminosity production that can carve a sizable bow - shock cavity .",
    "the first channel is from the traditional magnetic dipole model of a pulsar , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pulsar spin - down time scale ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the pulsar period , @xmath17 is the pulsar magnetic field strength ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is the pulsar radius , and @xmath20 is the moment of inertia . in equation [ eq : lp ] , and throughout this work , we have taken @xmath21 cm and @xmath22 as fiducial ns parameters .",
    "the second channel is the energy dissipation due to the torque on the binary system by the pulsar magnetic field @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the azimuthal twist ( hereafter taken to be equal to the @xmath25 upper bound ) .",
    "the orbital separation @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , whose evolution is driven by gravitational wave emission , is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the merging time scale @xcite .    to calculate the size of the cavity produced by the system , we substitute @xmath30 into equation [ eq : rbow ] . however , because the energy emitted propagates to the bow - shock interface in finite time , there is a lag of @xmath31 before @xmath7 can respond to changes in the luminosity at the source .",
    "we therefore make the transformation @xmath32 for our calculations .    in the following",
    "we will compare @xmath33 to the length scale of sgrb shock deceleration in the standard fireball model @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the isotropic - equivalent sgrb energy output and @xmath36 is the bulk lorentz factor . as we will see in section [ sec : aft ] , the behavior of the sgrb afterglow is modified if @xmath37 since , in the presence of a cavity , the swept - up mass required to cause the deceleration of a sgrb jet is not encountered until after @xmath7 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] we show the evolution of @xmath7 as a function of the time to merger @xmath38 for a fixed @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is roughly constant over time scales @xmath41 , so @xmath7 remains unchanged unless the pulsar magnetic field is sufficiently high to drive a significant increase in @xmath42 ( equation [ eq : lp ] ) at small orbital separations .",
    "we set @xmath43 yr and @xmath44 yr , roughly corresponding to the range of expected sgrb delay times . within this range ,",
    "magnetic fields @xmath45 g are required for @xmath42 to be the dominant contribution to @xmath7 . in all other cases ,",
    "@xmath40 determines the size scale of the bow - shock cavity . for comparison , we plot @xmath46 ( _ red _ dashed line ) and @xmath47 ( _ black _ dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] .",
    "we note that @xmath48 for a large range of realistic pulsar parameters ; the reader is referred to section  [ sec : dis ] for a detailed account of the fraction of neutron star binaries expected to satisfy this relation .",
    "we can compare the relative importance of each luminosity contribution to @xmath7 by separating it into @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] we plot these radii as a function of the pulsar magnetic field @xmath17 for @xmath51 and fiducial values of @xmath52 .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath7 is from @xmath40 for nearly all realistic values of @xmath17 and @xmath52 , while @xmath42 dominates for @xmath53 g , irrespective of @xmath52 ( assuming no field decay ; see section  [ sec : dis ] ) .",
    "in the standard fireball model for grb afterglows , an effective energy release occurs at observer time @xcite @xmath54 following the prompt emission .",
    "this is the time it takes for the outgoing sgrb shockwave to sweep up a mass @xmath55 .",
    "if , however , @xmath56 , then the mass required to decelerate the ejecta is pushed out to @xmath7 by the poynting flux emanating from the pulsar companion . in this case , the onset of the afterglow will be delayed to @xmath57 in the observer frame .",
    "the fulfillment of the condition @xmath56 would naturally give rise to a wide range of afterglow behavior .",
    "since @xmath7 can in some cases greatly exceed @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] ) , afterglows can be expected to trail the prompt emission by tens to hundreds of seconds , depending on the properties of the pulsar companion .",
    "these delays are consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the afterglow properties of sgrbs originating inside pulsar cavities we make use of the _ mezcal _ special relativistic adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code , a parallel , shock capturing code routinely used to simulate the propagation of relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the numerical framework , afterglow lightcurve calculation and tests of the srhd implementation are presented in @xcite . for this discussion",
    "we shall assume the blastwave is adiabatic and effectively spherical .    usually in the study of sgrb afterglows from compact binary mergers",
    "one considers expansion into a uniform medium .",
    "however , since the wind of the pulsar meets the interstellar medium at some point , the density structure is more complex . in the first case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : aft ] ( _ red _ curve ) , the pre - explosive pulsar wind is weak enough that the ejecta is not significantly slowed down by the time it expands beyond the pulsar wind cavity @xmath59 , so that we expect the blast wave evolution to take place in a constant density medium .",
    "this phase ends when the energy is shared with so much material that the blast wave becomes sub - relativistic . beyond this point ,",
    "the blastwave slowly transitions into the classical sedov - taylor evolution , leading to a steeper decline in the lightcurve @xcite .    in the presence of a more luminous pulsar companion ,",
    "the shock front will expand unimpeded within the pulsar wind cavity until it reaches the density discontinuity placed at @xmath60 ( _ light blue _ curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : aft ] ) . over the typical time of observation of a sgrb",
    ", the impact of the blastwave with the thin shell will produce a prominent extended feature in the observed afterglow emission .",
    "the thin shell in this example is not massive enough to slow down the ejecta to non - relativistic speeds before the shock reaches the interstellar medium . in the last case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : aft ] ( _ dark blue _ curve ) , the cavity _ is _ large enough to slow down the ejecta to non - relativistic speeds before reaching the interstellar medium , as would occur for systems with large luminosities or small kick velocities . in this case , we expect the blastwave evolution as we see it to take place entirely within the thin shell , which has been placed at @xmath61 .",
    "if this occurs , then it is expected that the afterglow will exhibit a rapidly declining lightcurve ( like in the x - ray afterglows of grb 051210 and grb 060801 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : aft ] ) , which can be even more pronounced in two dimensional calculations when the lorentz factor of the flow drops below the inverse of the jet opening angle @xcite . a steeper decline ( like in the x - ray afterglow of grb 090515 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might also be expected if the magnetic field energy density , here assumed to be a fixed fraction @xmath62 of the downstream energy density of the shocked fluid , drastically changes as the blastwave expands beyond the thin - shell ( otherwise such steep declines might be difficult to reconcile with the simple model outlined here ) .",
    "this study reveals how the properties of sgrb afterglows from neutron star mergers depend sensitively on whether or not one of the binary members is a pulsar .",
    "the key to delaying the onset of a sgrb afterglow lies in the relation @xmath56 , and therefore it is natural to examine the range of conditions for which this constraint is satisfied . taking the ratio of equations [ eq : rbow ] and [ eq : rdec ] , we find @xmath63 this ratio is modestly dependent on the properties of the pulsar companion and the bulk lorentz factor but highly insensitive to @xmath11 and @xmath64 .",
    "it is clear from equation [ eq : ratio ] that a lower kick velocity can ensure @xmath65 .",
    "for sufficiently small kick velocities ( @xmath66 10 km s@xmath2 ) , equation  [ eq : rbow ] no longer provides a good description for @xmath7 and a spherically symmetric calculation becomes more appropriate @xcite .",
    "such cavities can be as large as fractions of a parsec or more , giving rise to shock deceleration months after the sgrb , and resulting in a much lower afterglow luminosity that could easily go undetected .",
    "however , given that ns / ns and ns / bh binaries are typically bestowed velocities in excess of @xmath67 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we do not expect that this will commonly occur .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath7 represents a _ lower limit _ to the bow - shock distance scale , which can be enhanced by factors of two or more depending on the orientation of the binary within the cavity .    in this _",
    "letter _ we have shown that , under certain conditions , the behavior of sgrb afterglows can be altered from the predictions of the standard theory , independently of long - lasting jet activity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] we translate these conditions to a @xmath16-@xmath68 diagram , where @xmath16 and @xmath68 are the pulsar period and its time derivative , respectively . as discussed in previous sections , the region of interest separates into two branches : low field pulsars with long spin - down time scales and high field pulsars ( @xmath69 g ) .",
    "low field pulsars depend on their spin to generate the luminosity required to ensure @xmath65 , so that an additional constraint should be that @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] , we have truncated the region of interest to exclude low field pulsars with @xmath70 myr . to get a sense for the likelihood that such conditions can actually be realized",
    ", we have included population contours from the ns / ns population synthesis modelling of @xcite . with the caveat that the uncertainties of population synthesis are significant , a sizeable fraction of ns / ns binaries lie within the region of interest for the most likely model of @xcite , and all of these systems are in the low field , long lived pulsar branch .",
    "as we have demonstrated , the spindown luminosity always dominates the growth of the standoff shock radius provided that @xmath71 g. if this condition is not satisfied , then the pulsar lifetime @xmath52 becomes irrelevant because most of the energy injection into the cavity takes places as the binary merges .",
    "however , the preceding argument is only valid under the assumption that no significant magnetic field decay occurs .",
    "the processes of pulsar field decay are controversial , with suggested time scales between 100 kyr and 1 gyr @xcite . given these uncertainties , we urge caution in the application of these results for high field pulsars .    it is clear from the analysis presented here that the afterglow lightcurve can be strongly modified by the presence of a pulsar within the system .",
    "this implies that we can not be too specific about the exact times at which we expect to see transitions in the afterglow , but if and when we do see these transitions , they can be fairly constraining on the properties of the system .",
    "our results indicate , however , that for canonical values the expected range of time delays are consistent with _",
    "swift _ observations of sgrb afterglows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aft ] ) , particularly when accounting for the instrument dead - time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although more elaborate modelling may be needed to explain the few extreme fading x - ray afterglows , this simplified scenario ameliorates the need for a long - lasting central engine , for which it is hard to see how it might naturally generate the prompt emission @xcite .",
