    "the problem of a 2d bloch electron under a uniform magnetic field has been intensively studied for several decades,@xmath0 and it is well known that the energy spectrum is characterized by the hofstadter s butterfly showing a fractal nature.@xmath1 recently the problem has attracted theoretically renewed interest in connection with various phenomena such as the quantum hall effect,@xmath2 the flux state model for high-@xmath3 superconductivity,@xmath4 and the mean - field transition temperature of superconducting networks or josephson junction arrays.@xmath5 besides , recent advance in submicron technology that makes it possible to fabricate any desired microstructures has stimulated experimental study to find indication of the hofstadter s spectrum and its effect on the transport and optical properties.@xmath6 in parallel with this problem , the study on 2d electron systems under nonuniform ( either disordered@xmath7 or periodic@xmath8 ) magnetic fields has been extensively performed , and lots of interesting characteristics in the energy spectral and transport properties have been elucidated .    though the problem of a 2d bloch electron under spatially modulated magnetic fields has attracted less attention compared with the problem of 2d electron gas under spatially modulated magnetic fields,@xmath9 it is still an important problem not only in the view of theoretical interest but also in the view of experimental interest , and there have been attempts to solve this problem.@xmath10 however , unfortunately , some of the relevant works contain inconsistent results on the energy spectral properties : in ref .",

    "et al_. studied the effect of a one - dimensional sine - modulated ( 1dsm ) field on a 2d bloch electron to argue that the symmetries appeared in the hofstadter s spectrum break down by the field modulation .",
    "most surprisingly , they also argued that the field modulation leads an additional crisscross pattern like a spiderweb structure onto the hofstadter s spectrum .",
    "oh _ et al_.@xmath11 studied the effect of a 1d cosine - modulated ( 1dcm ) field on a 2d bloch electron to elucidate that occurrence of gap closing and gap opening leads different energy spectrum from the hofstadter s spectrum and that the symmetries appeared in the hofstadter s spectrum except the dual property still remain despite the field modulation . in the meanwhile , shi and szeto@xmath12 studied the energy spectrum of a 2d bloch electron under a kind of 2d field modulation to argue that there is no symmetry breaking in the energy spectrum and that the fractal structure remains irrespective of the field modulation .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine the problem of a 2d bloch electron under spatially modulated magnetic fields to settle the inconsistency discussed above . in doing this",
    ", we take into account four kinds of modulated fields ( i.e. , 1dsm , 1dcm , 2dsm , and 2dcm fields ) in order to obtain rather generic effects of the field modulation on the hofstadter s spectrum . by means of direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix",
    ", we calculate the energy eigenvalues and examine how the system parameters such as the kind of the modulation , the relative strength of the modulated field to the uniform field , and the period of the modulation influence on the energy band structure and the symmetry of the hofstadter s spectrum .",
    "introduction of the field modulation is shown to change the @xmath13 dependence of the energy spectrum drastically , leading occurrence of gap opening , gap closing , band crossing , and band broadening , which are the origin of distinctive energy band structure from the hofstadter s spectrum .",
    "our results indicate that there is no additional spiderweb structure in the energy spectrum contrary to the result of ref .  24 and that the field modulation generically breaks the symmetries and the fractal property of the hofstadter s spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce four kinds of magnetic fields and the tight - binding model . and , in sec .",
    "iii we present numerical results on the energy band structure of a bloch electron and the symmetries of the energy spectrum under these fields .",
    "section  iv is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "we consider an electron in a 2d square lattice under a spatially modulated magnetic field @xmath14\\hat{z},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the uniform ( modulated ) part of an applied magnetic field . among possible kinds of modulated fields , we pay attention to two kinds of modulated fields .",
    "the one is the sm field @xmath16 and the other is the cm field @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the strength of the modulated field and @xmath19 is the period of the modulation along the @xmath20 @xmath21 direction . under the landau gauge ,",
    "the vector potential becomes @xmath22 for the sm field and @xmath23 for the cm field , respectively .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian describing the motion of an electron in a magnetic field is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hopping integral between the nearest - neighboring sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the magnetic phase factor .",
    "under the vector potentials given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) , the magnetic phase factor becomes @xmath29 with @xmath30 for the sm field and @xmath31 for the cm field , respectively .",

    "the magnetic flux per unit cell , in units of the flux quantum @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 .    by means of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) , the tight - binding equation can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 is the ratio of hopping integrals between the @xmath20 and @xmath41 directions , and @xmath42 is the energy in units of @xmath43 . here",
    ", the wave function is given by @xmath44 .    denoting @xmath45 as the periodicity of @xmath46 ,",

    "we calculate the energy eigenvalues for all the values of @xmath13 in the fmbz by directly diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "in what follows , we assume the modulated field has a square - symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) and consider only the case of the isotropic hopping integral ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) for the sake of simplicity . and",
    "we pay attention to the energy dispersions for @xmath52 ( with setting @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 because energy dispersions for other values of @xmath55 can be obtained in a similar way . here",

    "@xmath60 becomes zero .",
    "thus , by means of the translational invariance along the @xmath41 direction , eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) reduces to the harper equation @xmath61 and there are @xmath57 eigenvalues for a given value of @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath57 is odd , the full energy spectrum consists of @xmath57 subbands . in the meanwhile , when @xmath57 is even , the full energy spectrum consists of @xmath63 subbands because two central subbands touch at zero energy . here",
    "the full energy spectrum means a set of energy eigenvalues obtained by taking into account all the values of @xmath13 in the fmbz .",
    "energy dispersions for @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given as follows :    \\(a ) @xmath64 : we have @xmath66 and the energy dispersion is given by @xmath67 there are two subbands and they touch at zero energy as shown in fig .",

    "it is well known that the hofstadter s spectrum has the following symmetries ; ( i ) the dual property between the @xmath75 and @xmath62 directions ( let us denote it as @xmath76 ) , ( ii ) the symmetry between @xmath77 and @xmath42 ( @xmath78 ) , ( iii ) the symmetry between @xmath79 and @xmath75 ( @xmath80 ) , and ( iv ) the symmetry between @xmath81 and @xmath62 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath83 holds only when all the values of @xmath13 in the fmbz are taken into account ; for a given value of @xmath13 , one can easily check that @xmath83 does not hold for odd @xmath57 .",

    "since the touching points exist irrespective of @xmath84 , the full energy spectrum exhibits a single subband structure as in the case of @xmath59 .    in order to demonstrate the @xmath85 dependence of the energy spectrum with @xmath64 , we calculate energy spectra for various values of @xmath85 and plot some of them in fig .  2 .",
    "even though there are six and four subbands for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , there occurs direct touching between the nearest neighboring subbands , which leads a single subband structure of the full energy spectrum . in the calculations , we find that the energy band structure is independent of the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 while the total bandwidth slightly changes with varying @xmath84 .",

    "besides , there exists indirect overlapping ( i.e. , crossing of subbands at different values of @xmath62 ) between the central subbands .",
    "thus , the full energy spectrum still exhibits a three subband structure as can be seen in fig .",
    "however , as @xmath84 increases , there occurs gap opening between the subbands and the full energy spectrum exhibits a six subband structure as in fig .",
    ". further increase of @xmath84 makes the second and the fourth gaps closed , leading a four subband structure as in fig .",

    "figs .  2 and 3",
    "show that @xmath83 remains under the 1dsm field , which is contrary to the arguments of ref .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy lies in the range of @xmath13 taken into account in discussing the symmetry of the energy spectrum . in ref .",
    "24 only a particular value of @xmath13 was taken into account , while all the values of @xmath13 in the fmbz are taken into account in this paper . here",
    "we would like to stress that all the values of @xmath13 in the fmbz should be considered in order to discuss the symmetry of the energy spectrum .",
    "this is because @xmath83 of the hofstadter s spectrum holds only when the all the values of @xmath13 in the fmbz is considered .",
    "we also find that @xmath103 still remains under the 1dsm field while whether @xmath104 remains or not depends crucially on @xmath57 and @xmath85 .",
    "note that @xmath105 breaks down by introducing the 1d field modulation .      in order to test how the energy spectrum is influenced on the kind of the field modulation",

    "the two central subbands directly touch at two points of @xmath62 and the upper ( lower ) two subbands indirectly overlap with each other , resulting a single subband structure as in fig .",
    "however , as @xmath84 increases , indirect overlapping between the upper ( lower ) two subbands disappears and there occurs gap opening between them .",

    "each subband directly touches with its neighboring subbands and the full energy spectrum exhibits a single subband structure regardless of @xmath84 ; the only effect of @xmath84 is to change the energy bandwidth .",
    "we also perform similar calculations for the energy spectrum with @xmath69 . when @xmath101 , we have @xmath70 and there are three subbands . for small values of @xmath84 , the three subbands separate each other , exhibiting a three subband structure as in the case of @xmath59",

    "note that @xmath104 depends on the kind of the field modulation ; it remains ( breaks ) in the 1dcm ( 1dsm ) field .    before ending this subsection",
    ", we would like to mention two comments .",
    "first , we assume @xmath85 to be an integer for the sake of simplicity even though it can be arbitrary real value .",
    "besides , we consider only the values of @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) in the case of the cm ( sm ) field because @xmath87 becomes nonuniform only under these conditions . however , the authors of ref .  24 violated this condition",
    "; they chose @xmath111 in their calculations .",
    "but , when @xmath111 , @xmath87 becomes uniform as can be easily checked by eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) and the energy spectrum should be identical with the hofstadter s spectrum if all the values of @xmath13 in the fmbz are taken into account , which implies that the results of the cited paper , i.e. , the appearance of additional crisscross pattern like a spiderweb structure and the symmetry breaking of the energy spectrum , are erroneous ones coming from mistakes in choosing the values of @xmath85 and in choosing the values of @xmath13 . note that the method of diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix used in the present paper or in the cited paper and the method of the transfer matrix used in ref .",
    "25 are equivalent .",
    "actually , fig .",
    "5(a ) in the present paper is exactly the same as fig .",
    "2(b ) in ref .  25 .",
    "second , the tight - binding model we are considering is basically a one - band model .",
    "thus , we focus our attention on energy spectra only for the values of @xmath84 that are not large ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) since there might be interband mixing between different landau levels for large values of @xmath84 .      when the field modulation is along both lateral directions , @xmath60 becomes nonzero and @xmath87 becomes periodic in both lateral directions with the period @xmath85 .",
    "the lattice is called the checkerboard flux lattice@xmath89 and the energy spectrum can be obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath113 hamiltonian matrix .",
    "when @xmath91 , we have @xmath114 and the hamiltonian matrix becomes @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , respectively . by diagonalizing eq.([eq:17 ] ) we obtain the energy dispersion as @xmath120 which is plotted in fig .  6 .",
    "numbering the four subbands in order of lowering energy , one can see that the first ( second ) and the third ( fourth ) subbands directly touch at the center of fmbz regardless of @xmath84 .",
    "there also exists band crossing between the second and the third subbands , which is absent in the case of the 1d field modulation .",
    "equation  ( 18 ) indicates that the full energy spectrum exhibits a single subband structure regardless of @xmath84 and the total bandwidth changes with varying @xmath84 .    when @xmath96 , we have @xmath121 and there are eighteen subbands",
    ". however , due to occurrence of direct touching and indirect overlapping between neighboring subbands , the full energy spectrum exhibits a single subband structure regardless of @xmath84 .",

    ", we find that occurrence of gap closing , gap opening , band crossing , and band broadening is a generic effect of the field modulation .    when @xmath96 , there are eighteen subbands . for small values of @xmath84 ,",
    "due to direct touching and indirect overlapping between the inner sixteen subbands , the full energy spectrum exhibits a three subband structure .",
    "however , there occurs gap opening between the inner sixteen subbands with increasing @xmath84 , resulting a five subband structure .",

    ". however , gap closing occurs with increasing @xmath84 , and the three subband structure becomes a single subband structure .",
    "further increase of @xmath84 makes the full energy spectrum consist of seven subbands .",
    "for @xmath102 , we show the @xmath84 dependence of the energy spectrum in fig .  8 , where concurrent occurrence of gap opening and gap closing can be seen .",
    "in this case , there are twenty four subbands and they compose a three subband structure for small values of @xmath84 . however , as @xmath84 increases , there occurs band splitting and the full energy spectrum exhibits a seven subband structure",

    "the energy spectrum in the 2dsm field with @xmath101 has a flipped symmetry with respect to @xmath129 . here",
    "the flipped symmetry means that the energy spectrum in the range of @xmath130 is the same as that in the range of @xmath131 when @xmath42 is replaced by @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath105 also depends sensitively on the system parameters ; it holds ( breaks ) for the values of @xmath55 that make @xmath103 and @xmath104 remain ( break ) .    before ending up this subsection",
    ", we would like to mention a few comments .",
    "the first is that the above results on @xmath132 are not from a theoretical analysis but from a numerical study .",
    "thus , further study such as the group theoretical analysis@xmath133 is required in order to deepen the understanding of the symmetry breaking .",
    "the second is that the @xmath75 and @xmath62 directions taken into account in discussing @xmath134 are not the high symmetry directions of the hamiltonian under the 2d modulated fields .",
    "the reason for taking into account these directions , nevertheless , lies in testing how @xmath134 appeared in the hofstadter s spectrum is influenced by the field modulation .",
    "since symmetry breaking is generally expected if the symmetry axis is not properly chosen , our result that the breaking of @xmath134 depends on the system parameters is quite natural .",
    "finally , it may be worthwhile to note the result of ref .",
    "26 , where shi and szeto considered a bloch electron in the magnetic field @xmath135\\hat{z}\\ ] ] and found that there is no symmetry breaking in the energy spectrum and that the fractal structure remains even though the energy spectrum becomes different from the hofstadter s spectrum , which seems to be contrary to our results .",
    "however , since the directions used in ref .",
    "26 are the highly symmetric @xmath136 directions while the directions used in this paper are the @xmath75 and @xmath62 directions , it may not be easy to compare both results directly .",
    "the only thing we can say is that the field modulation given by in this paper [ i.e. , eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) ] is more generalized than that of ref .",
    "26 [ i.e. , eq .  ( 19 ) ] ; specifying the periodic magnetic field by a magnetic unit cell , the lattice with eq .  ( 19 ) becomes the simple checkerboard lattice [ see , for example , fig .",
    "2(a ) of ref .",
    "23 ] while the lattice with eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) becomes a generalized checkerboard lattice [ see fig .",
    "2(b ) of ref .",
    "thus we expect that the latter may present more generic effect of the field modulation than the former .",
    "further theoretical study on the comparison between two cases is also required .",
    "in summary , we studied the effects of spatially modulated magnetic fields on the hofstadter s spectrum . in order to obtain rather general properties of the effect of the field modulation",
    ", we took into account four kinds of modulated fields and calculated energy eigenvalues with varying @xmath57 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "occurrence of gap opening , gap closing , band crossing , and band broadening was found to be characteristic features of the field modulation , which leads distinctive energy band structure from the hofstadter s spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that these characteristics are very important since the change of the energy dispersion may have crucial influence on the transport properties ; it may allow an electron to change its orbit , in view of the semiclassical language .",
    "there is also a possibility of quenching the integer quantum hall behavior and exhibiting normal behavior when the subgaps are smeared out .",
    "sensitive dependence of the energy spectrum on the system parameters implies that it may be difficult to detect direct indication of the hofstadter s spectrum in experiment since even a tiny change of the magnetic field leads much complicated energy band structure .",
    "we also studied the effect of the field modulation on the symmetries appeared in the hofstadter s spectrum and illustrated that the symmetries sensitively depend on the system parameters . in this work ,",
    "we have paid attention to the energy spectral properties only with a rational flux and the isotropic hopping integral . since an introduction of hopping anisotropy",
    "is known to lead interesting phenomena like band broadening,@xmath137 it may be interesting to study the effect of hopping anisotropy on the energy spectrum of a 2d bloch electron under the modulated magnetic fields .",

    "<S> we study the effect of spatially modulated magnetic fields on the energy spectrum of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bloch electron . taking into account four kinds of modulated fields and using the method of direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate energy spectra with varying system parameters ( i.e. , the kind of the modulation , the relative strength of the modulated field to the uniform background field , and the period of the modulation ) to elucidate that the energy band structure sensitively depends on such parameters : inclusion of spatially modulated fields into a uniform field leads occurrence of gap opening , gap closing , band crossing , and band broadening , resulting distinctive energy band structure from the hofstadter s spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the effect of the field modulation on the symmetries appeared in the hofstadter s spectrum in detail .    2 </S>"
