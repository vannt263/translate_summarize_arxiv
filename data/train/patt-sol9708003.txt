    "[ sec4 ] , we study the spatio - temporal patterns in the presence of periodic external force and investigate the effect of it on the propagation phenomenon and turing patterns . depending upon the choice of control parameters , a transition from hexagons to regular rhombic structures , hexagons to rolls and then to breathing oscillations from hexagons are observed .",
    "the presence of external force with sufficient strength removes the penta - hepta defect pair originally present in the spontaneously formed hexagonal patterns leading to the formation of regular rhombic structures .",
    "the inclusion of external periodic force can also induce a transition from hexagons to rolls provided there are domains of small roll structures in the absence of force .",
    "we further show that in the region of hopf - turing instability , the inclusion of external periodic force with sufficiently small amplitude induces a type of breathing oscillations though the system shows a regular hexagonal pattern in the absence of any external force .",

    "[ sec5 ] when individual oscillators oscillate chaotically . in this case , the emergence of spatio - temporal patterns depends on the system size . for larger size , above a critical number of cells , we observe a controlled space - time regular pattern eventhough the single mlc circuit itself oscillates chaotically .",

    "when this wave front reaches the weakly coupled cell , the existence of the stationary front @xmath98 for the array due to the presence of the weakly coupled cell will block the propagating front and hence it will end up in the stationary front @xmath98 asymptotically for @xmath154 . for @xmath155 ,",
    "the stationary state @xmath98 is no longer stable and hence the propagation occurs without any blocking .",
    "thus the blocking of the wave front can also be attributed to the existence of a stable stationary front when weak coupling is present in the system .",
    "another interesting dynamical phenomenon in the coupled arrays is the formation of turing patterns .",
    "these patterns are observed in many reaction diffusion systems when a homogeneous steady state which is stable due to small spatial perturbations in the absence of diffusion becomes unstable in the presence of diffusion[turing , 1952 ] . to be specific , the turing patterns can be observed in a two variable reaction - diffusion system when one of the variables diffuses faster than the other and undergo turing bifurcation , that is , diffusion driven instability[turing , 1952 ; murray , 1989 ] .    treating the coupled array of mlc circuits as a discrete version of a reaction - diffusion system , one can as well observe the turing patterns in this model also .",
    "for this purpose , one has to study the linear stability of system ( 3 ) near the steady state . in continuous systems ,",
    "the linear stability analysis is necessary to arrive at the conditions for diffusion driven instability .",
    "a detailed derivation of the general conditions for the diffusion driven instability can be found in murray[1989 ] . for discrete cases one can follow the same derivation as in the case of continuous systems by considering solutions of the form @xmath156 [ murray 1989 ; muuzuri _ et al .",

    ". however , our aim here is to investigate the effect of external forcing on these patterns , which is taken up in the next section .",
    "the effect of external fields on a variety of dynamical systems has been studied for a long time as driven systems are very common from a practical point of view .",
    "for example , in a large number of dynamical systems including the duffing oscillator , van der pol oscillator and the presently studied mlc circuits , temporal forcing leads to a variety of complex dynamical phenomena such as bifurcations , quasiperiodicity , intermittency , chaos and so on[guckenheimer & holmes , 1983 ; hao bai - lin , 1984 ; lakshmanan & murali,1996 ] . also the studies on the effect of external fields in spatially extended systems",
    "have been receiving considerably increasing interest in recent times [ pismen , 1987 ; walgraef , 1988 ; 1996 ] .",
    "particularly , with the recent advances in identifying localized and oscillating structures and other spatio - temporal patterns in driven nonlinear dissipative systems such as granular media , driven ginzburg - landau equations and so on , it is of considerable interest to study the effects of forcing on array of coupled systems such as ( 3 ) .",
    "motivated by the above , we investigate the effect of external forcing in the propagation of wave front and formation of turing patterns in the coupled mlc circuits in one and two dimensions .",
    "in this subsection we study the effect of external forcing on the propagation of wave fronts . for this purpose",
    "we consider an one dimensional array of coupled mlc circuits with initial and boundary conditions as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] .",

    "[ fig6](a ) ) as in the case @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "of course this can be expected as the external force is periodic in time . however , interesting things happen in the propagation failure region discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] . in this region , beyond a certain critical strength of the external forcing , the wavefront tries to move a little distance and then stops , leading to a partial propagation .",
    "[ fig6](b ) shows such a partial propagation observed for @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( this may be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "the phenomenon can be explained by considering the propagation failure mechanism discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3b ] in which one may look for a spatially stationary and temporally oscillating wavefront . the initial wavefront tries to settle in the nearby stationary state .",
    "however , the system will take a little time and space to settle due the effect of forcing combined with the transient behaviour of the system .",
    "thus the inclusion of external forcing in the propagation failure region can induce the wavefront to achieve a partial propagation .",
    "it is well known that the defects are inherent in very many natural pattern forming systems . in most of the pattern forming systems , the observed patterns are not ideal .",
    "for example , the patterns are not of perfect rolls or hexagons or rhombs .",
    "a commonly observed defect in such systems is the so called penta - hepta defect ( phd ) pair which is the bound state of two dislocations [ tsimring , 1996 ] .",
    "experiments on spatially extended systems often show the occurrence of phd in spontaneously developed hexagonal patterns[pantaloni & cerisier , 1983 ] . in the present case also",
    ", the existence of phd pair can be clearly seen from fig . [ fig5](d ) .",
    "in such a situation , it is important to study the effect of external periodic force in the coupled arrays of mlc circuits .",
    "now we include a periodic force with frequency @xmath182 and amplitude @xmath178 in each cell of the array and we numerically integrate eqs.([eqn3all ] ) using fourth order runge - kutta method with zero flux at boundaries . by fixing the frequency of the the external periodic force as @xmath173 and varying the amplitude ( @xmath178 ) we analyse the pattern which emerges spontaneously .",
    "interestingly for @xmath183 , the defects ( phd pair ) which are present in the absence of external force ( fig . [ fig5](d ) ) , gets removed resulting in the     and ( b ) the same figure in fourier space . ]",

    "[ fig8](b)-[fig8](d ) show the gray scale plots for @xmath195 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively .",

    "[ fig9 ] shows the typical snapshots of the oscillating pattern at various instants for the specific choice @xmath210 .",

    "<S> the circuit recently proposed by murali , lakshmanan and chua ( mlc ) is one of the simplest non - autonomous nonlinear electronic circuits which shows a variety of dynamical phenomena including various bifurcations , chaos and so on . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the spatio - temporal dynamics in one and two dimensional arrays of coupled mlc circuits both in the absence as well as in the presence of external periodic force . in the absence of any external force , </S>",
    "<S> the propagation phenomena of travelling wave front and its failure have been observed from numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the propagation of travelling wave front is due to the loss of stability of the steady states ( stationary front ) via subcritical bifurcation coupled with the presence of necessary basin of attraction of the steady states . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effect of weak coupling on the propagation phenomenon in one dimensional array which results in the blocking of wave front due to the existence of a stationary front . </S>",
    "<S> further we have observed the spontaneous formation of hexagonal patterns ( with penta - hepta defects ) due to turing instability in the two dimensional array . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a transition from hexagonal to rhombic structures occur by the influence of external periodic force . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the transition from hexagons to rolls and hexagons to breathing ( space time periodic oscillations ) motion in the presence of external periodic force . </S>",
    "<S> we further analyse the spatio - temporal chaotic dynamics of the coupled mlc circuits ( in one dimension ) under the influence of external periodic forcing . here </S>",
    "<S> we note that the dynamics is critically dependent on the system size . above a threshold size </S>",
    "<S> , a suppression of spatio - temporal chaos occurs , leading to a space - time regular ( periodic ) pattern eventhough the single mlc circuit itself shows a chaotic behaviour . below this critical size , however , a synchronization of spatiotemporal chaos is observed . </S>"
