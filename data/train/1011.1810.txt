    "the coulomb field of the atomic core can play a significant role in the strong - field photoionization process essentially modifying the dynamics of low - energy electrons .",
    "it is responsible , in particular , for the appearance of a rich structure in the momentum distribution of photoelectrons near the ionization threshold @xcite , for frustrating the tunneling ionization @xcite and for the creation of a low - energy structure ( les ) in photoelectron spectra in mid - infrared laser fields @xcite .",
    "the coulomb field focuses low - energy electrons towards the laser polarization direction which is mostly due to multiple rescattering @xcite of ionized electrons by the atomic core at large impact parameters and is termed coulomb focusing ( cf ) @xcite . for a theoretical description of coulomb field effects , different modifications of the strong field approximation @xcite",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "in addition , the classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) method has been successfully employed , see e.g. @xcite , for estimation of the effects which are not intrinsically quantum mechanical .",
    "recently , the strong field physics in mid - infrared laser fields has attracted a lot of attention in connection with the possibility of improving high - order harmonic generation with mid - infrared driver fields @xcite . in mid - infrared laser fields , when the keldysh parameter is small @xmath0 , the electron dynamics after tunneling is mainly classical .",
    "this is because the characteristic energies of the process , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , greatly exceed the photon energy in this regime @xmath3 . here , @xmath1 is the ionization potential , @xmath4 the ponderomotive energy , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the laser field amplitude and frequency , respectively ( atomic units are used throughout ) . in this regime ,",
    "the classical features of the three - step model @xcite are conspicuous and not obscured by interference effects .",
    "two recent experiments by blaga et al .",
    "@xcite and quan et al .",
    "@xcite on the photoionization of atoms and molecules in strong mid - infrared laser fields reveal a characteristic spike - like les in the energy distribution of electrons emitted along the laser polarization direction .",
    "the cf is responsible for the effect @xcite .",
    "more concretely , the les arises due to multiple forward scattering ( fs ) by coulomb field @xcite .",
    "the cf is usually predicted to decrease with increase in the laser intensity and wavelength because the average rescattering velocity and the impact parameter increase in such circumstances . as a consequence",
    ", one may expect that the contribution of high - order fs should also decrease . in this context",
    ", it was surprising that at a large wavelength of the mid - infrared laser field , the multiple fs plays a decisive role for the creation of the les .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how the contribution of different components of cf depends on laser intensity and wavelength .",
    "our investigation is limited to the classical interaction regime in mid - infrared laser fields .",
    "separate components of cf are identified which scale differently with laser parameters : cf which happens immediately after ionization - initial cf ( icf ) ; cf due to the electron fs on recollision with atomic core , and asymptotic cf ( acf ) when the electron momentum is disturbed by the coulomb field after the laser pulse is switched off .",
    "special attention is devoted to the contribution of the high - order fs events and to the definition of the effective number of fs events .",
    "we use the ctmc method with tunneling and the coulomb field of the atomic core fully taken into account .",
    "the 3d ctmc method employed in this paper is developed as follows .",
    "( 1 ) an ensemble of electrons is formed corresponding to the tunneled electron wave packet according to the ammosov - delone - krainov ( adk ) theory @xcite .",
    "the electrons are born with the following initial conditions . the electron initial position along the laser polarization direction",
    "is derived from the landau s effective potential theory @xcite .",
    "the transverse coordinates of the initial position are zero .",
    "the initial longitudinal momentum is zero and the transverse one follows the corresponding adk distribution @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the electron wave - packet propagates in the field of a laser pulse and coulomb potential via the solution of newton equations . ( 3 ) the positions and momenta of electrons when the laser pulse is switched off are used to calculate the asymptotic momenta at the detector @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) each trajectory is weighted by the adk ionization rate and the initial transverse momentum distribution function @xcite .",
    "( 5 ) the shape of the laser pulse is half - trapezoidal : for the first ten cycles , the field has a constant amplitude and is ramped off within the last three cycles .",
    "the electrons are launched within the first half cycle since there are no multi - cycle interference effects in the classical calculation .",
    "the ensemble consists of @xmath7 particles and the convergence is checked via double increase of this number .",
    "the target atom is neon with ionization potential @xmath8 ev which can endure a maximum laser intensity @xmath9 w/@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the process is in the tunneling regime , e.g. , @xmath11 at @xmath12 w/@xmath10 and wavelength @xmath13 m .",
    "we estimate the contributions of the multiple fs , icf and acf to the total cf in the following way : ( 1 ) for each rescattering event at the moment @xmath14 , the minimal distance from the core @xmath15 , the distance from the core in the transverse plane ( with respect to the laser polarization direction ) @xmath16 and the electron momentum @xmath17 are determined numerically .",
    "then , the transverse momentum change @xmath18 due to the coulomb potential @xmath19 at the @xmath20-th forward scattering event is estimated as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the rescattering time duration . when the electron velocity @xmath17 in the fs event is large , @xmath23 . in the opposite case , @xmath24 is determined by the laser field @xmath25 at the @xmath20-th rescattering moment @xmath14 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath26 ( 2 ) the transverse momentum change due to icf is estimated numerically as the deviation of the exact transverse momentum from that neglecting the coulomb potential , after a half laser period following the ionization moment @xmath27 : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the laser period and @xmath30 is the electron transverse momentum neglecting the coulomb field .",
    "the numerical estimate for @xmath31 is slightly larger in absolute value than the analytical one @xcite : @xmath32 with the initial transverse momentum @xmath33 .",
    "( 3 ) we estimate the acf contribution via numerical comparison of the asymptotic electron momentum with the one after switching off the laser pulse .",
    "the cf is mainly due to multiple small - angle scattering .",
    "it is significant only for low energy photoelectrons , and we will examine the dynamics for such electrons in details .",
    "the cf is characterized by the transverse momentum change @xmath18 induced by the coulomb field @xcite which depends on the ionization phase @xmath34 .",

    "[ intensity ] , our criterion gives for @xmath91 a number between 5 and 6 ( for the concreteness @xmath97 is assumed ) .",
    "the number of scattering according to eq.([bars3 ] ) increases slowly with increase in the laser intensity and wavelength .",
    "generally , the total cf effect decreases with intensity and wavelength because the main contribution in cf comes from the multiple forward scattering which , in total , decreases as expected , see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ( b ) and ( d ) , where the curves in the phase space move down , generally , with increasing laser intensity and wavelength . the exception is the tail at @xmath53 in fig .",

    "note that the consecutive slope changes of the phase space distribution are responsible for the creation of les and are determined by the contributions of the second , third and forth fs @xcite .",

    "the relative contribution of icf to the total @xmath18 with respect to fs increases with increasing wavelength but to a lesser extent than in the case of the intensity dependence .",
