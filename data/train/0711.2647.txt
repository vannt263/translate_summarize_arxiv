    "the pre - main sequence ( pms ) evolutionary phase is the short time span between the birth of a star from interstellar clouds and the onset of hydrogen burning upon its arrival on the main sequence .",
    "gravitational contraction is the main energy source during this stage .",
    "low - mass pms stars ( i.e. , with masses lower than @xmath01.5 @xmath1 ) that have recently become visible in the optical range and contract along their hayashi tracks @xcite , presumably evolve to t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "they primarily have spectral types ranging from late f to m. intermediate - mass young stars ( i.e. , with masses between @xmath01.5 and 10@xmath1 ) evolve more rapidly to herbig ae / be ( haebe ) objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with spectral types b to early f. the evolutionary stage of a haebe star is ambiguous : stars with masses below @xmath04 @xmath1 are still in their pms phase , while hotter stars have already started nuclear hydrogen burning before they become visible in the optical range .",
    "members of both groups , t tauri and haebe stars , show regular and irregular photometric and spectroscopic variability on very different timescales , indicating that stellar activity begins in the earliest phases of stellar evolution .",
    "a and early f type pms stars with masses between 1.5 and 4@xmath1 have the right combination of effective temperature , luminosity and mass to become vibrationally unstable . with the now considerably increased number of known pms pulsators and candidates it is possible to compare the instability regions for pre- and ( post- ) main sequence stars .",
    "after the discovery of the first two pulsating pms stars in the young cluster ngc 2264 @xcite , it took more than 20 years until another pms pulsator was found .",
    "@xcite observed the herbig ae field star hr5999 and detected @xmath2 scuti - like pulsations with an amplitude of @xmath013mmag in johnson @xmath3 and a period of @xmath05.0 hours in the presence of irregular 350mmag background variability coming from the obscuring material in which the star is embedded .",
    "these measurements enabled for the first time the examination of the internal structure of a pms star using asteroseismology and to put constraints on the pulsation models @xcite .",
    "since then , several detections of pulsations in herbig ae field stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as in members of young clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been published .",
    "the pms pulsators have the same spectral types and luminosities as the classical @xmath2 scuti stars .",
    "hence , it is expected that their pulsation is driven by similar mechanisms , i.e. , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mechanisms in the hydrogen and helium ionization zones @xcite .",
    "the unstable modes in pulsating pms stars known so far are similar to those for classical @xmath2 scuti stars , namely low radial order p- and g - modes @xcite . compared to post - main sequence stars ,",
    "the inner parts of pms stars are more uniform in density and chemical composition and without the presence of nuclear reactions , which is the reason for a lack of avoided crossing @xcite",
    ". frequencies of @xmath6 modes with same radial order are nearly identical for pre- and post main sequence stars @xcite . for nonradial modes ( @xmath7 ) the patterns are more complicated due to evolutionary changes in the stellar interior and allow a discrimination between pms and ( post- ) main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "these are very interesting differences which can be tested with asteroseismology . using single - site ccd time series observations and the recently developed nonradial pulsation models for pms stars",
    ", it was possible for the first time to identify the 5 significant pulsation frequencies in ngc 6383 27 as @xmath8 = 0 , 1 and 2 modes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their star number 170 ) .    until recently",
    ", 36 pulsating pms stars have been discovered , of which 30 are bona fide pms pulsators and 6 remain pulsating pms candidates because their periods could not be determined accurately enough yet . using dedicated time series photometry , pms pulsation has been discovered in 18 members of 6 young open clusters and in 18 herbig ae field stars .",
    "a complete catalog of the presently known pulsating pms stars and candidates including an overview of their parameters is given in table [ allpmspuls2006 ] .",
    "consequently , the instability region for pms pulsators can be investigated observationally and compared to the classical @xmath2 scuti instability strip .",
    "the evolutionary stage of a star with given effective temperature ( @xmath9 ) , luminosity , and mass may be ambiguous , as the evolutionary tracks for pre- and post - main sequence stars intersect several times ( e.g. , see figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the pms nature of a star has to be assessed by other means than the position in the hr diagram .",
    "the six young open clusters that host pms pulsators are all younger than 10 million years indicating that their a to f type members have not reached the zams yet .",
    "hence , a basic membership criterion was the location of the targets of interest in the respective cluster hr diagrams .",
    "in addition , proper motion data from the tycho-2 @xcite and the ascc2.5 catalogues ( all - sky compiled catalogue of 2.5 million stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used for a verification of their cluster membership , and , hence , their pms nature .",
    "unfortunately , for only three of the cluster stars ( see table [ pmsnature ] ) proper motion data are listed .    only for the stars 53 and 38 in ngc 6530",
    "membership probabilites are published to be 78% and 68% , respectively @xcite .    for star ngc 6383 27",
    ", h@xmath10 is in emission , and a near infrared excess was detected by @xcite .",
    "these features are characteristic for haebe objects ( see below ) , hence the pms nature of ngc 6383 27 seems to be confirmed .",
    "herbig ae stars are known to be pms objects because their observable characteristics ( e.g. , typical emission lines , infrared and ultraviolet excess ) seem to originate from the protostellar material in which such young stars are still embedded . except for v 351 ori and",
    "v 1247 lac all pulsating pms field stars ( see table [ allpmspuls2006 ] ) are included in the catalog of herbig ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite included v 351 ori ( their star pds 201 ) in their list of herbig ae / be candidates and link this star with the ori b star forming region . as the observed h@xmath10 emission is quite weak for this star , @xcite indicate that might be already a more evolved herbig ae star .",
    "hence , its evolutionary stage is still disputed .",
    "v 1247 ori ( pds 192 ) shows symmetric h@xmath10 emission features without , or with only very shallow absorption features @xcite .",
    "it is  like v 351 ori  suggested to belong to the ori b star forming region and its pms evolutionary phase is highly probable .",
    "the observational instability strip for classical ( post- ) main sequence @xmath2 scuti stars is usually given in absolute magnitude ( @xmath11 ) versus dereddened strmgren @xmath12 color @xcite .",
    "for the pulsating pms stars only limited additional information is available , both spectroscopic and photometric . while apparent magnitudes and johnson @xmath13 are provided ,",
    "strmgren measurements exist for only 4 of the cluster and 7 of the field stars .",
    "hence , for a direct comparison of classical @xmath2 scuti and pulsating pms stars , @xmath11 and @xmath14 had to be derived for both star groups .",
    "for the _ cluster _ stars the calculation of absolute magnitudes and dereddened colors was done using the cluster distances and color excess ( see table [ pmspulsinfo ] ) .",
    "the situation is not satisfactory for the 18 pulsating pms _ field _ stars .",
    "parallaxes are published for 16 of them , but of low quality .",
    "for part of the stars , @xmath11 based on those parallaxes yields implausible values , i.e. , the stars would be located below the zams .",
    "the other parallaxes have large errors . for pds 2 ,",
    "e.g. , the error of the parallax is @xmath03 times larger than the parallax itself ( table [ fpmspulsinfo ] ) .",
    "furthermore the color excess @xmath15 was not measured for any of the pulsating pms field objects .",
    "hence , the following general relation for reddening in the interstellar medium was applied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the interstellar absorption in @xmath3 .",
    "it has to be stressed that this can only be taken as a first estimate ( see table [ fpmspulsinfo ] ) .    with the relations given in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath12 colors of the classical @xmath2 scuti stars were transformed into @xmath14 values .",
    "any transformation is affected by errors , but they are smaller when transforming intermediate band to broad band photometry than vice versa .",
    "consequently , we transformed the @xmath12 colors of the @xmath2 scuti stars to @xmath14 .",
    "it is now possible to compare classical @xmath2 scuti to pulsating pms stars in a common parameter space , @xmath11 vs. @xmath14 , ( fig .",
    "[ newstrip - bv ] ) . for the @xmath2 scuti stars @xmath11",
    "is taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open circles in fig .",
    "[ newstrip - bv ] ) and for the pms pulsators and candidates @xmath11 was computed from the cluster distances ( filled and open diamonds ; table [ pmspulsinfo ] ) and parallaxes of the field stars ( filled squares ; table [ fpmspulsinfo ] ) . for the majority of pms field pulsators the published parallaxes either place the stars below the zams or have large ( i.e. , @xmath19 10% ) errors .",
    "hence , only two pulsating pms field stars are selected for the hr diagram : @xmath20 pic and hd 104237 , with errors in the parallaxes of 1% and 6% , respectively . according to , pms pulsators and @xmath2 scuti stars seem to populate the same instability region in the hr diagram .",
    "a lack of pulsating pms stars is visible at the  cool \" corner of the instability region for classical @xmath2 scuti stars . whether this is only a selection effect caused by poor number statistics or has some astrophysical reason ,",
    "can only be speculated about .",
    "figure [ newstrip - bv ] also shows the uncertainties in @xmath11 and @xmath14 for the pms pulsators . for the pulsating pms _ cluster _ stars the errors in @xmath11 were computed from the errors in distance ( table [ pmspulsinfo ] ) and the @xmath14 errors were either taken from the literature , if available , or propagated from the listed errors in @xmath3 and @xmath21 measurements . in an analogous manner , the @xmath11 errors for the pulsating pms _ field _ stars were calculated from the errors in the parallax ( table [ fpmspulsinfo ] ) . as the parallax errors are typically larger than 10% , only two of the 18 pulsating pms field stars with accurate enough parallaxes could be used for the comparison of pms pulsators and @xmath2 scuti stars in the hr diagram . for the pulsating pms field stars errors for @xmath13",
    "are scarce in the literature and we estimated them as standard deviations of independently measured and published @xmath3 and @xmath21 magnitudes .",
    "note that the computed errors in @xmath14 for the field stars are at least 5 times larger than for all other stars .    for ngc 6823 230 ( open diamond )",
    "only a single value for @xmath3 and @xmath21 can be found in the literature without any error information .",
    "hence , no errors in @xmath14 and also in @xmath11 can be determined for this star .",
    "it is remarkable , that - despite of the large formal errors - most pms pulsators are located within the instability strip .",
    "this fact may indicate a too pessimistic error estimate for these stars .",
    "two outliers can clearly be identified : the pms cluster stars , ngc 6823 230 ( open diamond ) and ngc 6823 279 , are located bluewards of the blue border of the classical instability strip .",
    "the distance of ngc 6823 has the largest error compared to the other clusters containing pulsating pms stars .",
    "the general cluster @xmath15 of 0.845 mag adopted for the two pms stars seems to be overestimated considering their position in a rather unobscured region of the cluster .",
    "for 36 pms stars ( @xmath2 scuti - like ) pulsations were discovered by different authors within the last years .",
    "the pms evolutionary phase of these stars has been assessed from observational evidences : either they are members of young open clusters or herbig ae stars .",
    "although only limited information is available in the literature for pulsating pms stars , it is possible to explore their positions in the observational hr diagram .",
    "these positions and the observed period range support predictions of driving mechanisms for pms pulsation that are similar to @xmath2 scuti stars . furthermore , the hot and cool boundaries of the @xmath2 scuti instability strip seem to coincide with the borders for the pulsating pms stars .",
    "it has to be noted that in general the determination of fundamental parameters for pulsating pms stars is still unsatisfactory . for only two of the 18 pulsating pms field stars the parallaxes are accurate enough to be useful for a comparison to the @xmath2 scuti stars .",
    "young clusters frequently exhibit strong differential reddening and field herbig ae stars are often surrounded by circumstellar gas and dust which severely limits the determination of @xmath14 .",
    "temperature calibrations using @xmath13 colors exist for stars on the zams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but their applicability to pms stars that have luminosity classes iii to v is questionable .",
    "consequently , no @xmath9 and @xmath22 data are provided in this paper .    with a dense enough observed pulsation frequency spectrum it will be possible to discriminate directly between evolutionary stages using asteroseismology , as recently has been successfully demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "this avoids hazards with poorly determined distances and photometric indices      use was made of the webda database ( http://www.univie.ac.at/webda ) , developed by j .- c.mermilliod ( laboratory of astrophysics of the epfl , switzerland ) and operated by e. paunzen at the university of vienna , austria .",

    "<S> a comparison of the hot and cool boundaries of the classical instability strip with observations has been an important test for stellar structure and evolution models of post- and main sequence stars . over the last few years </S>",
    "<S> , the number of pulsating pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars has increased significantly : 36 pms pulsators and candidates are known as of june 2007 . </S>",
    "<S> this number allows to investigate the location of the empirical pms instability region and to compare its boundaries to those of the classical ( post- and main sequence ) instability strip . due to the structural differences of pms and ( post-)main sequence stars , </S>",
    "<S> the frequency spacings for nonradial modes will be measurably different , thus challenging asteroseismology as a diagnostic tool . </S>"
