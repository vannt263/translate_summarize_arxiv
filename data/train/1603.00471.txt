    "the effective reddening and extinction are meaningfully dependent on intrinsic color .",
    "we find wd25 , wd28 , and wd33 are consistent with single star membership in ngc 2099 because they are within 2@xmath32 of the trend in both distance modulus and reddening .",

    "additionally , its younger cooling age of 204 myr is well within the ngc 2099 cluster age of 520@xmath850 myr ( kalirai et  al .",
    "2001 ; paper i ) . however , we note the unlikelihood of a binary with two nearly equivalent db white dwarfs and the lack of balmer features in the spectrum ( see figure 2 ) that would indicate a da companion .",
    "irrespective of membership , wd27 is an interesting and very rare db because it is both moderately hot and high mass ( see bergeron et  al .",
    "2011 ; koester & kepler 2015 ) .",
    "figure 2 displays the spectral fits of the three white dwarf members wd25 , wd28 , and wd33 , and the db white dwarf wd27 .",
    "while the wd33 spectrum has low s / n , most notably at the two highest - order balmer lines , at this high mass and moderate t@xmath4 these highest - order lines become increasingly less sensitive to log g. for example , fitting only the first four balmer lines derives log g=9.23@xmath80.22 and only the first three lines derives log g=9.30@xmath80.24 .",
    "lastly , spectral analysis of 831 synthetic spectra with input parameters of t@xmath4=32,900 k and log g=9.27 and s / n=22 finds a normally distributed series of log g measurements with a mean consistent with the input , and the distribution s @xmath32 matches our spectral analysis s fitting error .",
    "we measured the ifmr by comparing each white dwarf s cooling age to the ngc 2099 cluster age ( 520 myr ) .",
    "the difference between these ages gives the evolutionary time to the tip of the agb for each white dwarf s progenitor .",

    ", we also illustrate the weakened sensitivity to mass at a higher t@xmath4 of 65,000 k ( black ) . ]",
    "beginning with the high - mass db white dwarf wd27 , if wd27 is a double degenerate consistent with cluster membership it may have undergone some level of binary interaction in its past .",
    "this could potentially explain its nature , but this would also make its inferred m@xmath5 unreliable . testing this , its relatively short cooling time of 204@xmath22 myr implies a m@xmath5 of only 3.46@xmath36 m@xmath1 , while our ifmr fit gives that a singly evolved 1.0 m@xmath1 white dwarf would have a @xmath35.0 m@xmath1 progenitor .",
    "figure 3 compares the paper i and ii imfr data with vphasj1103 - 5837 , the updated pleiades white dwarfs , and the three newly observed ngc 2099 members .",
    "wd25 , wd28 , vphasj1103 - 5837 , pg 0136 + 251 , and gd50 are strongly consistent with the paper ii ifmr trend .",
    "the ultramassive wd33 , however , is very discrepant , but there are several possible explanations for this .",
    "first , is it a supermassive white dwarf formed through a merger of two lower - mass white dwarfs ? based on the models of white dwarf mergers from dan et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the mechanism to create a stable supermassive white dwarf requires the merging of two comparable white dwarfs of approximately half its mass ( @xmath30.64 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "based on the age of ngc 2099 this is pushing the minimum mass of a white dwarf that could have formed after 520 myr .",
    "binary interactions could have affected their evolutionary timescales , but they still would have likely just formed in the recent past and would not have had the time to both merge to create wd33 and subsequently cool for 233 myr .",
    "second , wd33 could be the result of a binary merger event that occurred while the components were still evolving .",
    "two binary components of both @xmath33.5 m@xmath1 could have undergone interaction and subsequent merger .",
    "this would have created a short - lived @xmath37 m@xmath1 blue straggler that quickly formed into wd33 and had sufficient time to still cool for 233 myr .",
    "lastly , another possibility relates to both the analysis and systematic errors in the one cooling models themselves .",
    "the errors in black in figure 3 are the 1@xmath32 errors in both m@xmath6 and m@xmath5 . expanding our error analysis in wd33 to look at 2@xmath32 variations in log g ( in red )",
    "finds that at higher masses the uncertainty in the cooling age rapidly expands .",
    "this results from a white dwarf s radius becoming increasingly sensitive to mass in this regime ( althaus et  al .  2005 ; 2007 ) .",
    "figure 4 displays the althaus et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) mass - radius relationship at wd33 s t@xmath4 of 32,900 k. this mass sensitivity in radius also leads to a significant sensitivity in log g , cooling age , and luminosity at higher masses . in figure 4",
    ", we also analyze the sensitivity to wd33 s 1@xmath32 t@xmath4 error ( 1100 k ) for cooling age and luminosity , with a high - t@xmath4 ( blue ) and low - t@xmath4 ( red ) curve .",
    "this illustrates that at the highest masses the sensitivity of the cooling age to t@xmath4 errors is minor relative to the mass dependence .    in application to the ultramassive ifmr",
    ", one advantage of these strong dependencies is that large errors in the spectroscopically derived log g result in only moderate to minor errors in m@xmath6 .",
    "a second advantage is that the increasing sensitivity of luminosity to m@xmath6 can be used to independently infer mass from photometry , but uncertainties in wd33 s observed magnitude and ngc 2099 s visual distance modulus currently limit how accurately we can observationally derive its m@xmath11 .",
    "the significant challenge for the ultramassive ifmr is the extreme sensitivity to m@xmath6 of cooling age , and hence m@xmath5 . as seen in table 1 and figure 4",
    ", wd33 s parameters only derive a modest cooling age of 233 myr , and with the adopted cluster age of 520 myr this gives a very low m@xmath6 of 3.58 m@xmath1 . a 1@xmath32 increase in wd33 s mass to 1.33 m@xmath1 increases the derived cooling age to 331 myr .",
    "while a 2@xmath32 increase in white dwarf mass , from propagating a 2@xmath32 increase in log g , to 1.36 m@xmath1 increases the cooling age to 546 myr , surpassing the cluster age . figure 3 demonstrates this strong dependence of initial and final mass errors with a single curve passing through wd33 .",
    "this also illustrates the additional challenge that as m@xmath5 increases the sensitivity of derived m@xmath5 to evolutionary lifetime increases rapidly .",
    "these cooling age challenges , reassuringly , do not equally affect all ultramassive white dwarfs . the youngest and hottest white dwarfs in this mass range are significantly less susceptible to these complications ( e.g. , gd50 ) .",
    "first , these young white dwarfs are higher luminosity , increasing the ease of acquiring high - signal spectra .",
    "second , the sensitivity of cooling age on white dwarf mass significantly decreases at high t@xmath4 .",
    "for example , at wd33 s t@xmath4 of 32,900",
    "k , a decrease in m@xmath6 from 3.36 to 3.34 m@xmath1 causes a 191 myr decrease in inferred cooling age . for a young white dwarf at t@xmath4 of 65,000",
    "k , this same change in m@xmath6 would result in a decrease in inferred cooling age of 37 myr ( see full comparison in figure 4 ) .",
    "a third advantage for young and ultramassive white dwarfs is that cooling ages are further complicated by dependencies on both the input physics and composition in the adopted cooling model , where potential systematics introduced in the cooling age grow rapidly with increasing cooling age .",
    "we have observed nine new white dwarf candidates in ngc 2099 .",
    "two intermediate - mass ( wd25 , wd28 ) and one ultramassive ( wd33 ) da white dwarfs were found to be consistent with membership .",
    "we also compared to the self - consistently analyzed gd50 , pg 0136 + 251 , and the newly discovered vphasj1103 - 5837 .",
    "application of these data to the ifmr finds strong consistency with our previous work for all but wd33 , but this may be explained by wd33 s significant m@xmath5 errors . acquiring additional spectroscopic signal on wd33 may be of interest , and more accurate photometry would also be useful , but overcoming these errors at this mass and t@xmath4 currently may not be viable at v=24.49 . for precise application of ultramassive white dwarfs to the ifmr , future studies should focus on clusters of age @xmath350 to 150 myr .",
    "nevertheless , because gd50 and pg 0136 + 251 are only kinematically connected to the pleiades , wd33 is the first ultramassive white dwarf that is photometrically consistent with membership in a star cluster .",

    "<S> three of these da white dwarfs are consistent with singly evolved cluster membership : an ultramassive ( 1.28@xmath0 m@xmath1 ) and two intermediate - mass ( 0.70 and 0.75 m@xmath1 ) white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of their cooling ages allows us to calculate their progenitor masses and establish new constraints on the initial - final mass relation . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate - mass white dwarfs are in strong agreement with previous work over this mass regime . </S>",
    "<S> the ultramassive white dwarf has @xmath2 = 24.5 , @xmath32  mag fainter than the other two remnants . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of this star has lower quality , so the derived stellar properties ( e.g. , t@xmath4 , log g ) have uncertainties that are several times higher than the brighter counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we measure these uncertainties and establish the star s final mass as the highest - mass white dwarf discovered thus far in a cluster , but we are unable to calculate its progenitor mass because at this high mass and cooler t@xmath4 its inferred cooling age is highly sensitive to its mass . at the highest temperatures , however , </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity of cooling age to an ultramassive white dwarf s mass is only moderate . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that future investigations of the upper - mass end of the initial - final mass relation must identify massive , newly formed white dwarfs ( i.e. , in young clusters with ages 50 - 150  myr ) . </S>"
