    "risk management is important in the practices of financial institutions and other corporations @xcite .",
    "derivatives are popular instruments to hedge exposures due to currency , interest rate and other market risks @xcite",
    ". an important step of risk management is to use these derivatives in an optimal way .",
    "the most popular derivatives are forwards , options and swaps .",
    "they are basic blocks for all sorts of other more complicated derivatives , and should be used prudently .",
    "several parameters need to be determined in the processes of risk management , and it is necessary to investigate the influence of these parameters on the aims of the hedging policies and the possibility of achieving these goals @xcite . however , the literature on risk management is much silent on how to optimally decide on these parameters @xcite .",
    "the problem of determining the optimal strike price and optimal hedging ratio is considered by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein , where a put option is used to hedge market risk under a constraint of budget .",
    "the chosen option is supposed to finish in - the - money at maturity in the aforementioned papers , such that the predicted loss of the hedged portfolio is different from the realized loss . and",
    "the constraint of hedging budget is supposed to be binding in those papers , which means that the company will always spend the maximum available to buy options , such that the cost of hedging is determined by the amount of hedging budget . whether the performance of hedging strategy is affected by the two assumptions",
    "is considered in this paper .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the aim of hedging is to minimize the potential loss of investment under a specified level of confidence .",
    "in other words , the optimal hedging strategy is to minimize the value - at - risk ( var ) under a specified level of risk .",
    "however , the present paper is different from the aforementioned papers in several aspects .",
    "first , the chosen put option is not supposed to finish in - the - money at maturity in this paper .",
    "as the possibility of inexecution is taken into account , the predicted loss of hedging is closer to the realized loss .",
    "second , the constraint of hedging budget is not supposed to be binding , such that the expenditure of hedging is not always equal to the maximum available .",
    "third , the available put options are specified by their strike prices in a discrete manner , such that the optimal strike price can only be chosen from a predetermined finite set of strike prices , which is similar to the situation faced in real world financial market .",
    "finally , the performances of the resulted optimal hedging strategies are investigated through hypothesis tests , where the failure of hedging means that the realized loss exceeds the level of var predicted by the hedging strategy .",
    "the simulated investigations indicate that the proposed method is more accurate than the method deduced from the spirit of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the stock hedging problem .",
    "section 3 presents the main theoretical analysis of loss and its risk , where the probability that the potential loss of hedging strategy exceeds a predetermined threshold is calculated under a geometric brownian motion .",
    "section 4 describes two methods to determine the optimal hedging strategy , one is deduced from the spirit of the aforementioned papers , and the other is proposed in the present paper .",
    "the failure rates of hedging strategies are compared through simulations in section 5 .",
    "section 6 gives the conclusions and discussions .",
    "analogously to @xcite and @xcite , a stock is supposed to be bought at time zero with price @xmath0 , and to be sold at time @xmath1 with uncertain price @xmath2 . in order to hedge the market risk of the stock , the company decides to choose one of the available put options written on the same stock with maturity at time @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is prior and close to @xmath1 , and the @xmath4 available put options are specified by their strike prices @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . as the prices of different put options are also different , the company needs to determine an optimal hedge ratio @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) with respect to the chosen strike price .",
    "the cost of hedging should be less than or equal to the predetermined hedging budget @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , the company needs to determine the optimal strike price and hedging ratio under the constraint of hedging budget .",
    "the chosen put option is supposed to finish in - the - money at maturity , and the constraint of hedging expenditure is supposed to be binding by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "these two assumptions are relaxed in this paper , such that the possibility of inexecution is taken into account , and the cost of hedging may be less than or equal to the maximum available . the performances of the hedging strategies with or without these assumptions are compared in the following sections .",
    "suppose the market price of the stock is @xmath0 at time zero , the hedge ratio is @xmath7 , the price of the put option is @xmath10 , and the riskless interest rate is @xmath11 . at time @xmath1 , the time value of the hedging portfolio is @xmath12 and the market price of the portfolio is @xmath13 therefore the loss of the portfolio is @xmath14 where @xmath15 , which is the payoff function of put option at maturity .    for a given threshold @xmath16 , the probability that the amount of loss exceeds @xmath16 is denoted as @xmath17 in other words , @xmath16 is the value - at - risk ( var ) at @xmath18 percentage level .",
    "there are several alternative measures of risk , such as cvar ( conditional value - at - risk ) , esf ( expected shortfall ) , cte ( conditional tail expectation ) , and other coherent risk measures @xcite .",
    "the criterion of optimality adopted in this paper is to minimize the var of the hedging strategy , which follows the papers by @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .    the mathematical model of stock price",

    "the present paper investigates the performances of two kinds of hedging strategies which are based on different assumptions .      a method to determine the optimal strike price and optimal hedge ratio",

    "the solution of this problem is achieved through numerical searching method in this paper , which is denoted as @xmath51 , and called the optimal strategy of abrw method .",
    "following @xcite , the subject of hedging is to minimize the var with one of the available put options . when the inexecution of the put option is taken into account , and the expenditure of hedging is not always the same as the maximum available , the probability that the potential loss exceeds the specified value of var can be calculated by proposition [ proposition1 ] . in other words , the company wants to solve the following problem @xmath52 where @xmath18 is the specified target of risk control , and @xmath9 is the constraint of hedging budget . the solution of this problem is denoted as @xmath53 , which is called the optimal hedging strategy with minimum var under @xmath18 percentage level .",
    "numerical searching method is used to solve this optimal problem in this paper .",
    "for the same level of @xmath18 , the resulted var deduced by abrw method may be different from the one proposed in this paper .",
    "a hedging strategy is called success if the realized loss is less than or equal to the predetermined level of var , otherwise the hedging strategy is called failure . in order to compare the performances of abrw method and the proposed method , simulated investigations are designed in this paper .",
    "the failure rates under various parameters are considered in this paper .",
    "the parameters are divided into four parts , including market factors @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( /year ) , time factors @xmath3 and @xmath1 ( day ) , management factors @xmath9 and @xmath18 , and interest rate factor @xmath11 ( /year ) .",
    "the standard value of each parameter is the fixed value when the other parameters are varied .",

    "the probabilities of failure are estimated from the simulated data , where @xmath9 increases from 0.05 to 5 , and the results are plotted in figure [ figure ] .    it can be found that the estimated probabilities of failure under the proposed method are all less than the predetermined level of risk management , while their counterparts under the abrw method are all greater than the specified level of @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the probability of failure with lower level of @xmath9 is not always greater than the probability with higher level of hedging budget under abrw method .",
    "these observations indicate that more hedging cost may not always produce better consequence of risk management .",
    "let all of the parameters take the standard values , the optimal strike prices and hedging ratios under both hedging strategies are the same , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the var under abrw method is @xmath57 , and the failure rate is @xmath58 , which does not pass the hypothesis test .",
    "and the var under the proposed method is @xmath59 , and the failure rate is @xmath60 , which passes the test .    if the influence of the binding constraint on hedge budget of abrw method is absolutely eliminated , the optimal strike price is @xmath61 , and the optimal hedging ratio is @xmath62 .",
    "the failure ratio reaches to a higher level @xmath63 .",

    "although this hedging strategy is not optimal in the sense of abrw , the performance is better than the optimal one given by abrw method .",
    "this observation indicates that the two key assumptions taken by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite may lead to strategies which is not really optimal with respect to the test of failure rate .",

    "the performances of the proposed method and the method deduced from the spirit of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are compared through simulated investigations , where a hypothesis test is proposed to determine whether the failure rate of hedging strategy is greater than the specified level of risk .",

    "the differences between the two methods are derived from the two assumptions .",
