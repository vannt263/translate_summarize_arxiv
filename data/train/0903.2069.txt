    "section [ sec : res ] presents the numerical results of our study and discusses the main features of the fidelity for disordered quantum chains .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "it is known that disorder can have interesting effects on a system s phase diagram @xcite . in particular , griffiths phases may arise as a result of the randomness @xcite . here",
    "we study the disordered anisotropic quantum xy spin chain in a random transverse field , a model where the disorder - free case can be analytically solved @xcite and for which some exact results are known in the disordered case @xcite .",

    "let us first recall the behavior of the fidelity susceptibility for the disorder - free case , where @xmath31 @xcite .",

    "the apparent subextensive scaling in the immediate vicinity of the anisotropy critical point is a numerical artifact due to the narrowing of the fidelity susceptibility peak as the system size grows .",

    "when randomness is introduced , translational invariance is lost , and hence superextensive scaling of the fidelity susceptibility does not necessarily imply quantum criticality . as discussed before , we find that locations of superextensive scaling reveal more general behavior beyond quantum criticality , namely griffiths phenomena @xcite .",
    "the effects of disorder on the physics of quantum magnets has been studied mainly using the strong - disorder renormalization group technique ( sdrg ) @xcite .",

    "furthermore , griffiths phases are predicted to appear both around the ising critical line and the anisotropy @xmath47 line .",

    "these results apply for the case of weak disorder , but we consider a range of moderate to strong disorder strengths . in order to compare with the results of mckenzie for the griffiths phase extent , we propose a rough criterion for determining the extent of the griffiths phase using the gap distribution .",

    "the width of this range of parameters is independent of system size and scales with the variance of the coupling or field distributions , in accordance with the result of @xcite .",
    "however , this criterion gives an extent several times larger than the mckenzie value , around both the ising and @xmath47 lines .",
    "this difference may be due to strong disorder or , rather , the result of an overestimation of the griffiths phase extent since the distribution @xmath81 having a maximum at zero does not directly imply a divergent zero - energy density of states . nonetheless , consistency between different estimations of the griffiths phase extent support the validity , at least qualitatively , of this approach .",

    "<S> the phase diagram of a quantum xy spin chain with gaussian - distributed random anisotropies and transverse fields is investigated , with focus on the fidelity susceptibility , a recently introduced quantum information theoretical measure . </S>",

    "<S> it is found that the fidelity susceptibility is not self - averaging near the disorder - free quantum critical lines . at the ising critical point the fidelity susceptibility scales as a disorder - strength independent stretched exponential of the system size , in contrast with the quadratic scaling at the corresponding point in the disorder - free xy chain . along the line where the average anisotropy vanishes the fidelity susceptibility appears to scale extensively , whereas in the disorder - free case </S>",
