    "our present universe is observed to be quite clumpy with numerous galaxies , groups of galaxies , galaxy clusters , and etc . which span a large dynamic range in mass .",
    "the mass distribution function of these large scale structures is the crucial key to the nature of primordial density fluctuations from which the cosmic structures are believed to have arisen through gravitational growth , recollapse , and virialization ( @xcite ) . since these gravitational processes are inherently nonlinear and sufficiently complicated , it is not an easy task to find the mass distribution function for bound objects analytically .",
    "owing to its important role in cosmology , however , much effort has been made on determining even an approximate expression of the mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; cavaliere , menci , & tozzi 1996 ) . for recent review ,",
    "see monaco ( 1997 ) .",
    "the pioneering attempt in this field has been ascribed to press @xmath9 schechter ( 1974 , hereafter ps ) who proposed an analytic formalism for the mass function based on two simple assumptions : 1 ) the initial density field is gaussian ; 2 ) the gravitational collapse of mass elements is spherical and homogeneous . along with these two assumptions",
    ", ps also postulated that the number densities of bound objects could be counted by filtering the initial linear density field .",
    "although much criticism thereafter was poured upon the ps formalism about its unrealistic treatment of the collapse process and unclarified arguments including the @xmath10 normalization factor of 2 , the ps mass function has survived many numerical tests , showing good agreement with the results from n - body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by somewhat unexpected success of the ps mass function , many authors have tried to understand why it works so well in practice .",
    "peacock @xmath9 heaven ( 1990 ) and bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have shown , by using the excursion set theory , that the @xmath11 factor of 2 in the ps formalism which is directly related to the _ cloud - in - cloud _ problem can be justified with a sharp k - space filter .",
    "jedamzik ( 1995 ) solved this cloud - in - cloud problem by means of the integral equation for the mass function .",
    "he insisted that the ps mass function should be altered even in the case of a sharp k - space filter . yet",
    "yano , nagashima , @xmath9 gouda ( 1996 ) have argued that the sharp k - space filter recovers the ps mass function with the normalization factor of 2 even in the jedamzik formalism if a mathematically consistent definition of isolated bound objects is used and the spatial correlations are neglected .",
    "they have also shown by introducing the two point correlation function into the jedamzik formalism that the possible overlapping effect of density fluctuations which is responsible for the fragmentation and the coagulation of bound objects ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) can be neglected either on very small or on large mass scales .",
    "the ps approach has been also applied to nonspherical dynamical models .",
    "monaco ( 1995 ) has suggested that the mass function should be treated as a lagrangian quantity . employing the zeldovich approximation as a proper lagrangian dynamics",
    ", he computed the collapse epoch along the first principal axis , and showed that the shear shortens the collapse time and thus more high - mass structures are expected to form than the original ps mass function predicts .",
    "this effect of the shear explains dynamically the lowered density threshold @xmath12 detected in several n - body experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "shandarin @xmath9 klypin ( 1984 ) have shown by n - body simulations that nonlinear clumps form from the lagrangian regions where the smallest eigenvalue of the deformation tensor , @xmath0 , reaches a local maximum .",
    "recently , audit , teyssier , @xmath9 alimi ( 1997 ) have proposed some analytic prescriptions to compute the collapse time along the second and the third principal axes , pointing out that lagrangian dynamics is not valid after the first axis collapse but the formation of real virialized clumps must correspond to the third axis collapse .",
    "their argument agrees with the n - body result obtained by shandarin @xmath9 klypin ( 1984 ) . in their analysis , the shear delays the third axis collapse rather than fastens it in contrast to its effect on the first axis collapse , which is in agreement with peebles ( 1990 ) .",
    "the normalization problem , however , has not been well addressed in these nonspherical approaches to the mass function .",
    "monaco ( 1995 ) adopted the normalization factor of 2 used in the ps formalism , while audit et al .",
    "( 1997 ) just assumed that the mass function could be normalized properly in any case .",
    "in this paper we study the eventual formation of clumps in a spatially flat matter - dominated universe , with fragmentation and coagulation effects ignored . in @xmath13 2 we review the statistical treatment of the mass function , highlighting the ps formalism . in @xmath13 3 a nonspherical approach to the collapse condition based on the zeldovich approximation is described , and two useful conditional probability distributions relating the density field to the collapse condition are derived . in @xmath13 4",
    "an @xmath7 is proposed to extend the validity of the lagrangian dynamics to the third axis collapse . with a help of this",
    "ansatz an analytic approximation to the mass function for clumps is derived . in @xmath13 5",
    "we justify the normalization factor @xmath8 of the resulting mass function by using the jedamzik integral equation . in @xmath13 6 the results are discussed and final conclusions are drawn .",
    "we relegate the detailed calculations and derivations to two appendices .",
    "the mass function @xmath14 is defined such that @xmath15 is the comoving number density of gravitationally bound objects in the mass range @xmath16 . to compute this statistics",
    ", it is assumed that the number densities of bound objects can be inferred from the linearly extrapolated density contrast field , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 : mean density ) . in other words , if a given region of the linear density field satisfies a specified criterion of collapse , then it is supposed to collapse and form a bound object .",
    "let @xmath19 be the probability of finding a region satisfying a given collapse condition in the linear density field filtered at mass scale @xmath20 , or equivalently the fraction of the volume occupied by the regions which will eventually collapse into bound objects with masses greater than @xmath20 .",
    "then we may write @xmath19 as follows : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the probability that the smoothed density field at any given point will have a value in the range @xmath23 , and @xmath24 stands for the probability that the chosen point with density @xmath2 will actually collapse . once @xmath25 and @xmath24 are determined , and then @xmath19 is found , the mass function @xmath14 can be easily obtained as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is nothing but the volume of a bound region with mass @xmath20 .",
    "the specific functional form of @xmath24 is determined by the chosen dynamics to explain the collapse process , while @xmath25 depends on the property of the initial density field which is often assumed to be gaussian in the standard cosmology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the gaussian density field smoothed out by a window function @xmath28 of scale radius @xmath29 is given by @xmath30}.\\ ] ] here the mass variance @xmath31 is a function of scale mass @xmath32 and estimated by @xmath33 are the fourier components of the density @xmath2 and the window function @xmath28 respectively .    according to the top - hat spherical model adopted by ps , the bound objects form in the regions where the linearly extrapolated density contrast @xmath2 , growing with time , reaches its critical value @xmath34 in a flat universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the regions with @xmath35 when filtered at scale radius @xmath29 correspond to the bound objects with masses greater than @xmath36 since it will have @xmath37 when filtered at some larger scale . thus in the ps formalism",
    "the collapse probability @xmath24 in equation ( 1 ) is determined solely by the density field itself , and can be expressed by the following heavyside step function : @xmath38 using equations ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 5 ) , one obtains @xmath39 } \\theta(\\delta - \\delta_{c})d\\delta \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma(m)}\\int^{\\infty}_{\\delta_{c}}\\ !",
    "\\exp\\bigg{[}-\\frac{\\delta^2}{2\\sigma^2(m)}\\bigg{]}d\\delta \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}{\\rm erfc}\\bigg{[}\\frac{\\delta_{c}}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma(m ) } \\bigg{]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where erfc(x ) is the complementary error function .",
    "one obvious problem with the above analysis is that the integral of @xmath40 over the whole range of mass does not give unity : @xmath41    this normalization problem is originated from the fact that the ps formalism does not account for the underdense regions properly . even for regions with @xmath42 at a given filtering scale , there is still a @xmath43 probability that such regions will have @xmath35 when filtered at some larger scale .",
    "but the ps formalism completely ignored those underdense regions in estimating @xmath19 , so half the mass initially present in the underdense regions was not taken care of .",
    "ps avoided this normalization problem simply by multiplying @xmath40 by a factor of @xmath44 , and wrote the mass function in the form such that @xmath45}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as mentioned in @xmath13 1 , the @xmath46 @xmath47 normalization factor of @xmath44 in equation ( 8) has been shown to be correct in the case of a sharp k - space filter [ @xmath48 , and various numerical tests have confirmed the ps mass function as a satisfactory approximation .",
    "nevertheless it still leaves much to be desired : the physical meaning of the sharp k - space filter has yet to be understood ; the gravitational collapse should be treated in more realistic models than the top - hat spherical one ; the lowered density threshold @xmath12 obtained in many numerical tests can not be explained by this statistical argument , and so the ps mass function is degraded to a phenomenological device .",
    "since ps derived their mass function on the basis of the top - hat spherical model in 1974 , the nonspherical nature of the gravitational collapse has been demonstrated by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; kuhlman , melott , @xmath9 shandarin 1996 ) .",
    "especially the shear has been shown to play a very important role in the formation of the nonlinear structures ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is necessary to consider more realistic dynamical models to understand the collapse process and find the mass function .    we choose the zeldovich approximation as a suitable lagrangian dynamics to take into account the nonspherical aspect of the gravitational collapse .",
    "however , instead of bringing the effect of the shear up to the surface , we try to retain the framework of the ps formalism , counting the number densities of bound objects from the filtered linear density field but with a different dynamical collapse probability @xmath24 in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) asserts that the trajectory of a cosmic particle in the comoving coordinates can be expressed by the following simple formula : @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the lagrangian ( initial ) and the eulerian ( final ) coordinates of the particle respectively , @xmath52 is the perturbation potential which is a gaussian random field , and @xmath53 describes the growth of density fluctuations as a function of time . throughout this paper ,",
    "we focus on a spatially flat matter - dominated universe with vanishing cosmological constant , in which case @xmath54 [ @xmath55 : the cosmic expansion factor ] .    applying a simple mass conservation relation @xmath56 to the above formula ( 9 )",
    "gives the following expression of the mass density : @xmath57[1 - d_{+}(t ) \\lambda_{2}({\\bf q})][1 - d_{+}(t)\\lambda_{3}({\\bf q } ) ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath0 are the ordered eigenvalues ( @xmath60 ) of the deformation tensor , @xmath61 equation ( 10 ) shows that three random fields @xmath62 in the lagrangian space are now the new dynamic quantities determining the collapse condition of given cosmic masses in the corresponding eulerian space .",
    "thus the mass function of bound objects can be built upon this lagrangian dynamical theory ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the actual dynamics for the formation of gravitationally bound objects is very complex . even in the frame of the zeldovich approximation ,",
    "the description of the gravitational collapse along all three directions is far from being simple and too cumbersome to use ( arnold , shandarin , @xmath9 zeldovich 1982 ) .",
    "here we employ rather a simplified dynamical model to approximate the collapse process and determine the collapse condition for the formation of clumps .",
    "provided that at least one of the eigenvalues is positive at a given ( lagrangian ) point , the denominator in equation ( 10 ) can become zero as @xmath53 increases with time , so the density @xmath63 will diverge , signaling collapse at the corresponding eulerian point . if only the largest eigenvalue is positive ( @xmath64 ) in a given region , then it collapses into a pancake . if two eigenvalues are positive ( @xmath65 ) while the third one is negative ( @xmath66 ) , then a filament forms .",
    "the formation of a virialized bound object  a clump occurs only if all of three eigenvalues are positive , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "so , in our dynamical model based on the zeldovich approximation , it is assumed that the lowest eigenvalue , @xmath0 , plays the most crucial role in determining the collapse condition for the formation of clumps .",
    "this assumption is in general agreement with shandarin @xmath9 klypin ( 1984 ) .",
    "the useful joint probability distribution of an ordered set ( @xmath67 ) is derived by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the mass variance as defined in equation ( 4 ) . from equation",
    "( 12 ) , one can see that the zeldovich approximation excludes both exactly spherical ( @xmath72 ) and exactly cylindrical ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) collapse .",
    "both types of collapse have zero probability of occurring .",
    "( however , the points with @xmath76 exist in generic fields on lines , that is on a set of measure zero in 3-dim . , while the points with @xmath72 do not exist at all . )    in order to obtain deeper qualitative understanding of the collapse in the zeldovich approximation , it may be also useful , in addition to this joint probability distribution ( 12 ) , to have individual probability distribution of each eigenvalue .",
    "but we found out a typo in his result . except for the typo , equation ( 13 )",
    "agrees with his result . ]",
    "( see appendix a ) : @xmath77 the above individual probability distributions ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) , and ( 15 ) for the rescaled variable @xmath78 are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath79 is gaussian despite that @xmath79 is not a gaussian random field .",
    "according to equation ( 15 ) , @xmath1 has a low probability of occurring , 0.08 ( see @xcite , or appendix a ) .",
    "however , the small value of @xmath80 does not indicate that only @xmath81 of the whole regions will collapse into clumps .",
    "but rather it indicates that the probability of finding a bound region at filtering mass scale @xmath20 is 0.08 , provided that it is included in an isolated bound object with larger mass @xmath82 ( see @xmath13 5 ) . here",
    "the isolated bound objects indicate the bound objects which have just collapsed at a given epoch .    in the following subsection",

    "it is shown that the maximum of @xmath94 is reached when @xmath95 .",
    "that is , the linearly extrapolated density of the regions satisfying @xmath3 is most likely to be around @xmath96 .",
    "the average density contrast , @xmath97 , can be also computed with equation ( 20 ) : @xmath98 so in the regions with @xmath1 , the average density @xmath97 is slightly higher than the most probable density , say @xmath99 .",
    "we note that for @xmath100 , @xmath99 roughly coincides with the lowered density threshold @xmath101 of the ps mass function , while @xmath97 is close to the spherical threshold value @xmath102 .",
    "setting @xmath103 means filtering the density field on characteristic mass scale @xmath5 [ defined by @xmath104 .",
    "thus the regions with @xmath3 for @xmath103 correspond to clumps with masses @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , as argued by monaco ( 1995 ) , it is unavoidable to limit our lagrangian dynamical approach to the high - mass section @xmath106 since the zeldovich approximation is valid only in the single stream regions , while the multistream regions are rare for @xmath105 ( @xcite ) .",

    "the probability of @xmath109 begins to exceed one - half when @xmath95 , and reaches unity when @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that the collapse of highly overdense regions @xmath111 will be always along all three directions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we take equation ( 22 ) as our nonspherical collapse probability @xmath24 and proceed to derive the mass function of clumps analytically in the next section .",
    "as noted earlier , the zeldovich approximation as a first order lagrangian theory works very well till the first orbit crossing ( corresponding to the formation of pancakes ) but breaks down afterwards in the multistream regime ( @xcite )",
    ". therefore the rather restrictive collapse condition purely based on this lagrangian formalism may not be fully satisfactory to describe the formation of clumps , especially low - mass objects .",
    "on the other hand , shandarin @xmath9 klypin ( 1984 ) have shown by n - body simulations that the clumps form from the lagrangian regions where the smallest eigenvalue @xmath0 of the deformation tensor reaches a local maximum .",
    "thus , one practical way to overcome the limited validity of the zeldovich approximation within the framework of our dynamical approach to mass functions is to parameterize the collapse condition by @xmath112 , assuming that the critical value of @xmath113 is a free parameter . employing this simple @xmath7 to derive @xmath14",

    "consequently , this ansatz is mathematically equivalent to parallel transformation of the density field itself by @xmath117 .",

    "this normalization factor is much larger than the factor of 2 in the ps formalism .",
    "however , this larger normalization factor can be explained by the larger amount of _ cloud - in - cloud _ occurrences in our dynamical formalism than in the ps formalism , as shown in @xmath13 5 where such amount is computed . in an ideal hierarchical model , all the masses",
    "are included in clumps . according to our dynamical model , only about 8% of all the masses",
    "are included in the clumps with the `` largest '' mass ( the `` largest mass '' of bound objects in the universe is , in a practical sense , @xmath120 ) .",

    "this distribution has shown that the most probable density contrast of such regions is around 1.5 at the characteristic mass scale @xmath5 .",
    "we have proposed a simple _ ansatz _ in order to treat the multistream regions where the lagrangian dynamics is not applicable .",
    "this ansatz has enabled us to derive an analytic mass function characterized by one free parameter , @xmath113 .",
    "the best approximate value of this parameter has been chosen to be @xmath154 .",
    "we admit that there is no background dynamical theory for determining directly the value of this free parameter which thus has to be found phenomenologically .",
    "however , the following arguments may give a hint to understand why this parameter has this value .",
    "a simple extrapolation of equation ( 10 ) into the multistream regions suggests that only the mass elements with @xmath155 collapse along all three directions by the present epoch of @xmath156 .",
    "however , the collapse along the first two directions increases the density , which therefore speeds up the collapse along the third directions .",
    "this roughly agrees with the conclusion of audit et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . using equation ( 24 ) from audit et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with their choice of the parameters ( @xmath157 ) , one can easily obtain for the collapse epoch @xmath158 that is always earlier than the prediction of the zeldovich approximation ( @xmath159 ) provided that @xmath160 .    for power law spectra",
    ", it has been shown that our resulting mass function with @xmath127 is in good agreement with the @xmath101 ps mass function in the high - mass section , but has lower peak and predicts more small - mass structures , which are in agreement with what has been detected in n - body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the prediction concerning the small - mass structures is least reliable not only in any ps - like approach , but also in our dynamical approach to the mass function since the validity domain of the zeldovich approximation is limited to the high - mass section as outlined in @xmath13 3.2 .    like the other ps - like formalisms ,",
    "a normalization factor for the mass function has been introduced , which in our case is @xmath161 .",
    "we have justified the normalization factor with a sharp k - space filter by using the jedamzik integral equation , showing that this rather large normalization factor is due to the low probability of finding a bound region @xmath162 at filtering mass scale @xmath20 included in an isolated bound region ( @xmath141 ) with larger mass @xmath163 .",
    "but the physical meaning of the sharp k - space filter has yet to be fully understood .",
    "we postpone the numerical testing of our mass function to the following paper .",
    "we are grateful to lev kofman , paolo catelan , and the referee for useful discussions and helpful comments .",
