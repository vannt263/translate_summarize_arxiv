    "formation of terrestrial planets and solid cores of giant planets is thought to proceed via the gravity - assisted merging of a large number of planetesimals  solid bodies with initial sizes of roughly several kilometers . despite a considerable progress made in this field since the pioneering works of safronov ( 1969 ) ,",
    "a number of important problems still remain unsolved .",
    "one of the most serious questions has to do with the time needed for planets to complete their growth to present sizes . in the framework of conventional theory",
    "this time is rather long , especially in the outer parts of the protoplanetary nebula ( @xmath3 yr ) , and it is likely that the gaseous component of the nebula dissipates much earlier ( in @xmath4 yr ) .",
    "this would make it very hard for the giant planets in our solar system to accrete their huge gaseous envelopes via core instability ( mizuno 1980 ) which is otherwise considered to be an attractive scenario .",
    "wetherill & stewart ( 1989 ) have identified a very rapid `` runaway '' regime of accretion of protoplanetary cores which at the time seemed like a solution of this problem .",
    "however , later on ida & makino ( 1993 ) and kokubo & ida ( 1996 , 1998 ) have demonstrated that the runaway accretion would persist only through a rather limited interval of time and that the final growth of protoplanetary cores to isolation ( which corresponds to roughly @xmath5 g at 1 au ) would proceed in a slow manner , making the formation of cores of giant planets rather problematic .",
    "these studies usually implied that the gaseous component of the nebula plays only a secondary role in the planet formation process .",
    "planetesimals were typically assumed to be rather massive ( @xmath6 g ) bodies weakly affected by the gas ( kokubo & ida 1998 ) .",
    "this allows gravity to excite energetic random motions of planetesimals leading to diminishing the role of gravitational focusing and reduction of accretion efficiency .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to relax this assumption and to see what impact is incurred on the planet formation picture by allowing most of the planetesimals to be small ( @xmath7 km ) bodies immersed in a gaseous environment .",
    "such planetesimals would be appreciably affected by the gas drag and we will demonstrate that this can bring qualitative changes to their dynamics in the vicinity of the protoplanetary cores and , consequently , to the behavior of the mass accretion rate of cores .    throughout this study we will use the following approximation to the structure of the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the particulate and gas surface densities correspondingly , @xmath10 is the gas sound speed , and @xmath11 is a distance from the sun @xmath12 scaled by 1 au .",
    "we will use the terms `` protoplanetary core '' and `` protoplanetary embryo '' interchangingly .",
    "physical density of planetesimals @xmath13 is always assumed to be @xmath14 g @xmath15 .",

    "it is well known ( hnon & petit 1986 ) that the hill radius @xmath64 of interacting bodies sets an important length scale for scattering in the disk . for two bodies with masses @xmath65 and @xmath66 hill radius is defined as @xmath67 in the case of scattering of planetesimals by a protoplanetary embryo having mass @xmath68 hill radius is determined solely by @xmath68 : @xmath69 .    for our purposes",
    "the planetesimal approach velocity can be represented as @xmath70 and it is different from the horizontal random velocity @xmath71 and vertical random velocity @xmath72 .",
    "additional contribution to @xmath63 in the form of the shear across the hill radius @xmath73 ( sometimes called the hill velocity ) appears because of the differential rotation of the disk .",
    "gravitational focusing of planetesimals by the embryo is determined by @xmath63 .",
    "velocity @xmath74 determines the vertical thickness of planetesimal disk , thus it regulates the volume number density of planetesimals @xmath75 for a given surface mass density @xmath76 : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a planetesimal mass .",
    "vertical velocity is much smaller than either @xmath63 or the total random velocity @xmath79 when @xmath80 .    whenever random velocity @xmath81 is less than @xmath73",
    " the so - called _ shear - dominated _ regime ( ida 1990 )  close approaches between gravitationally interacting bodies which might lead to their physical collision are only possible for the orbital separation @xmath82 . for @xmath83 ( distant encounters )",
    "orbital perturbations incurred in the course of scattering are small : changes of the random velocity @xmath84 and of the orbital separation @xmath85 produced by a _",
    "single _ scattering have magnitudes @xmath86 these increments can be positive or negative depending on the orbital phases of bodies and their random velocities before the encounter .",
    "the averages of these quantities over epicyclic phases were calculated by hasegawa & nakazawa ( 1990 ) and we quote here their result for the eccentricity ( it will be used in  [ sect : lower ] ) : @xmath87    in the case @xmath82 , when interacting bodies enter their mutual hill sphere , strong scattering takes place : @xmath88 with both increments being positive  orbits are repelled and random velocity @xmath89 is excited . at the same time , it is clear from purely geometrical considerations that for @xmath90 the change of the vertical velocity is proportional to the vertical projection of the random velocity perturbation , and is much smaller than the change in the horizontal velocity : @xmath91 since the total velocity increment @xmath84 is of the order or bigger than the initial random velocity of planetesimals , scattering for @xmath82 in the shear - dominated regime has a _ discrete _ character .",
    "another possible dynamical state of planetesimals is the _ dispersion - dominated _ regime which takes place whenever @xmath92 . in this case",
    "the epicyclic excursions of planetesimals allow collisions between the bodies with orbits separated by @xmath93 ; more distant bodies are again subject to only weak scattering . moreover , even particles having close approaches experience _ on average _ only small velocity perturbation compared to the pre - encounter velocity @xmath63 .",
    "this allows one to treat the scattering in the dispersion - dominated regime as a _ continuous _ process , unlike the discrete scattering in the shear - dominated regime .",
    "another important feature of the dispersion - dominated case is that @xmath94 , or @xmath95 , as a result of roughly three - dimensional nature of scattering in this regime which tends to isotropize highly anisotropic velocity distributions ( ida , kokubo , & makino 1993 ; rafikov 2003c ) .",
    "thus , it is enough to follow the evolution of only one component of planetesimal velocity ( e.g. @xmath42 ) in the dispersion - dominated regime .",
    "let s now proceed to considering planetesimal dynamics for different gas drag regimes .",
    "first , we explore the case of quadratic drag represented by equations ( [ eq : large_vel ] ) , ( [ eq : quadratic1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : quadratic2 ] ) which is valid for @xmath96 .",
    "this situation would most likely be realized in the inner parts of the protoplanetary nebula since @xmath18 is rather small there making epstein regime irrelevant and bringing reynolds number to a high value .",
    "we first assume that scattering occurs in the dispersion - dominated regime and try to figure out under which conditions a steady state can be realized in this case .",

    "( ida & makino 1993 ; rafikov 2003b ) @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a coulomb logarithm and @xmath99 for @xmath100 ( stewart & ida 2000 ) .",
    "because of the very weak dependence of @xmath101 on velocity we will set it to unity in our further discussion .",
    "balancing this growth rate by the damping due to the gas drag ( equation [ [ eq : quadratic1 ] ] ) we find that @xmath102    for further convenience we normalize the embryo s mass @xmath68 to a fiducial mass @xmath103 and planetesimal radius to a fiducial radius @xmath104 which are defined as @xmath105 these two parameters uniquely characterize the dynamics of the embryo - planetesimal scattering when the gas drag dependence on the velocity is represented by equation ( [ eq : large_vel ] ) .",
    "using this notation we conclude from ( [ eq : bigger_offset ] ) that @xmath92 and @xmath106 if @xmath107 from ( [ eq : smaller_offset ] ) we find that @xmath92 and @xmath108 if @xmath109 thus , conditions ( [ eq : dd_cond ] ) and ( [ eq : dd_cond1 ] ) determine the region in the parameter space @xmath110 in which planetesimals are dispersion - dominated with respect to embryo and maintain a steady - state velocity dispersion , see figure [ fig : earth ] .    whenever both ( [ eq : dd_cond ] ) and ( [ eq : dd_cond1 ] ) are not fulfilled , scattering of planetesimals proceeds in the shear - dominated regime .",
    "as we have previously mentioned , this type of interaction has a discrete nature  gas drag causes significant evolution of planetesimal velocity between close approaches to the embryo .",

    "immediately after scattering @xmath81 increases to @xmath112 , and the post - scattering value of planetesimal eccentricity is @xmath113 .",
    "we will see in  [ subsect : inclination ] that the inclination of planetesimals interacting with the embryo in the shear - dominated regime is typically much smaller than their eccentricity",

    "post - encounter velocity is above @xmath44 ( @xmath120 ) and damping by the gas drag is very efficient : @xmath121 , see equation ( [ eq : large_vel ] ) .",

    "planetesimals radially separated from the embryo by @xmath129 pass the embryo s hill sphere ( and experience strong scattering ) roughly every synodic period @xmath130 corresponding to the radial separation of @xmath64 : @xmath131 requiring the damping time @xmath46 to be shorter than @xmath130 ( which is necessary for planetesimals to stay in the shear - dominated regime ) for embryos less massive than @xmath103 is equivalent to demanding that @xmath132 around more massive embryos with @xmath119 planetesimal eccentricity is strongly damped between consecutive encounters with the embryo below its initial value if @xmath133 or if @xmath134 at the same time , eccentricity would not drop below @xmath124 prior to the next encounter if ( [ eq : sd_cond ] ) is not fulfilled simultaneously with ( [ eq : sd_cond1 ] ) .    comparing ( [ eq : sd_cond ] ) and ( [ eq : sd_cond1 ] ) with the dispersion - dominated conditions ( [ eq : dd_cond ] ) and ( [ eq : dd_cond1 ] ) we see that depending on @xmath135 and @xmath136 there can only be two possible states in the system : ( 1 ) either planetesimals are scattered in a smooth , continuous fashion in the dispersion - dominated regime , with gas drag not capable of damping their eccentricities significantly between the consecutive approaches to the embryo , or ( 2 ) they are strongly scattered by the embryo in the shear - dominated regime at each approach and gas appreciably reduces their random velocities before the next encounter takes place .",
    "the discrete nature of planetesimal scattering in the shear - dominated regime is very important for determining the approach velocity of planetesimals to the embryo .",
    "for example , if we were to assume that scattering in the shear - dominated regime is continuous ( like in the dispersion - dominated case ) the average rate of eccentricity growth would have had the form @xmath137 , since embryo increases planetesimal eccentricity by @xmath138 every synodic period . balancing this by the gas drag in the form ( [ eq : large_vel ] )",

    "it would however be a grave mistake to assume that this is the eccentricity with which planetesimal approaches the embryo .",

    "thus , proper treatment of the shear - dominated regime taking the discrete nature of scattering into account is crucial for figuring out the initial conditions of the interaction process .",
    "this will have important ramifications for the question of accretion of these planetesimals as we demonstrate in  [ sect : accretion ] .",
    "planetesimals interact with the gas in the stokes regime when @xmath141 and @xmath62 .",
    "the last condition depends not only on the particle size @xmath17 but also on its velocity .",
    "we introduce another fiducial size , @xmath142 , which is defined as a planetesimal size for which @xmath143 at @xmath144 : @xmath145 planetesimals with @xmath146 always experience gas drag in the stokes regime for @xmath147 ( because post - scattering planetesimal velocity is @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath62 ) .",
    "embryos more massive than @xmath103 endow shear - dominated planetesimals with velocity @xmath150 at each scattering episode .",
    "but even then planetesimals with sizes @xmath146 satisfying condition @xmath151 experience _ only _ the stokes drag , i.e. their maximum velocity and physical size are never large enough for their reynolds number to exceed @xmath152 .",
    "planetesimals scattered by more massive embryos would experience quadratic drag right after the encounter ( even if only temporarily ) before switching to the stokes regime . from equation ( [ eq : linear1 ] )",
    "one can easily see that damping between encounters is purely exponential for the stokes drag independent of the planetesimal velocity ( similar to the quadratic drag for @xmath153 , see  [ subsect : high_vel ] ) .",

    "for the shear - dominated planetesimals gap opening can be especially important , because in this dynamical regime planetesimal guiding centers are moved away from the embryo s orbit by @xmath129 in a single passage at @xmath197 , see ( [ eq : close ] ) ( rafikov 2001 ) .",
    "if this happens , accretion of planetesimals by the embryo can be severely affected ( rafikov 2003a ) .    at the same time",

    "this drift moves planetesimals which are located inside of the embryo s orbit further from it , facilitating the gap opening . on the other hand , on the outer side of",
    "the embryo s orbit gas drag causes planetesimals to drift _ towards _ the embryo , and this tends to oppose the gap formation .",
    "as long as planetesimals are less massive than the embryo , they are all repelled by scattering in the same way independent of their masses .",
    "thus , the question of whether the gap outside of the embryo s orbit is cleared or not depends only on the damping timescale ; there exists a critical size @xmath198 such that planetesimals of this size initially at @xmath82 from the embryo , after being repelled by roughly @xmath64 , can migrate back the same distance in a synodic period .",
    "only these planetesimals would be accreted by an isolated embryo : planetesimals with @xmath199 are too big to be brought back to the embryo by the gas drag , and a gap forms preventing their further accretion .",
    "planetesimals smaller than @xmath198 migrate so fast that in a synodic period they cross the embryo s orbit and are lost to the inner disk .",
    "embryo s accretion would then be rather inefficient as well .",
    "these problems arise only for an _ isolated _ protoplanetary core .",
    "however , during the intermediate stages of planet formation as a consequence of oligarchic growth ( kokubo & ida 1998 ) there would be _ many _ embryos present in a disk at the same time .",
    "their orbits should not be very widely separated : even if it were the case initially , subsequent increase in the embryo masses caused by the accretion of planetesimals would make these separations not too large ( see below ) in terms of their hill radii ( because @xmath64 expands as embryo s mass increases , see [ [ eq : hill ] ] ) and this is what is important for the dynamics .",
    "when such a `` crowded '' population of protoplanetary cores ( which is a natural outcome of oligarchic growth ) is present in the disk , gap formation is no longer an issue : although a particular embryo repels planetesimals and tends to open a gap , scattering by another nearby embryo pushes planetesimals back and spatially homogenizes them before they approach the first embryo again .",
    "gap formation is thus suppressed and accretion can proceed almost uninhibited . on the other side of the problem , although small shear - dominated planetesimals migrate through the orbit of some particular embryo because of the gas drag , there are many other embryos in the inner disk which scatter planetesimals back and forth , so that their inward drift looks more like a random walk through the nebula . in the course of such a diffusion through the protoplanetary disk planetesimals have a high chance of being accreted by one of the many embryos ( as long as planetesimals stay in the shear - dominated regime , see  [ sect : accretion ] ) .    at a glance",
    ", it seems improbable that embryos can remain on purely circular and uninclined orbits in a `` crowded '' configuration because at small radial separations they would strongly scatter each other and very quickly excite large random velocities .",

    "goes down and physical collisions can again start occurring quite frequently ; however , the imminent isotropization of velocities after every collision limits their importance ( in comparison with that of the gas drag ) only to short periods of time . as a result ,",
    "the timescale of velocity damping between encounters with embryos should still be very close to the gas damping time scale @xmath46 .",
    "physical collisions might affect the determination of @xmath308 since they can be effective at pumping the energy of horizontal motions into vertical ones .",
    "the minimum velocity anisotropy @xmath307 they provide can be determined from the condition @xmath309 and turns out to be roughly @xmath310 , @xmath311 , and @xmath312 for typical parameters of quadratic , stokes , and epstein drag regimes , see equations ( [ eq : timesc_rat_quad])-([eq : timesc_rat_epstein ] ) .",
    "scattering by distant embryos maintains horizontal random velocities of small planetesimals at the level given by ( [ eq : eq_ecc_quad])-([eq : eq_ecc_epstein ] ) , and this degree of anisotropy results in @xmath313 which for @xmath314 m planetesimals is about @xmath315 at 1 au and @xmath316 at @xmath193 au .",
    "comparing this with ( [ eq : i_eq_quad])-([eq : i_eq_epstein ] ) and ( [ eq : embryo_min_incl ] ) we may conclude that for not too small values of @xmath207 ( @xmath317 ) inelastic collisions are important for setting the minimum value of relative embryo - planetesimal inclination in the presence of gas drag in quadratic or stokes regimes ( in the inner parts of the proto - solar nebula , inside @xmath318 au ) .",
    "whenever shear - dominated planetesimals are affected by the gas drag in the epstein regime , inelastic collisions can compete with stirring by large planetesimals only for @xmath319 .",
    "this discussion has assumed rather idealized model of planetesimal collisions ( rigid balls ) . in reality",
    "high - energy impacts are likely to be catastrophic , leading to the disruption of participant bodies .",
    "then the amount of kinetic energy transferred into vertical motions and the degree of isotropization would be determined by the ejection velocities of resulting debris .",
    "observations of velocity dispersions in collisional families of asteroids ( zappala 1996 ) and results of numerical simulations ( michel 2003 ) indicate that ejection velocities are considerably smaller than the initial planetesimal velocities .",
    "this slows down the velocity isotropization compared to the case of collisions of `` hard balls '' .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect this to seriously change the general picture outlined before .",
    "besides , it is not at all clear how anisotropic would ejection velocities be in the case of planetesimals ( 10 - 100 m in size , strength - dominated fragmentation ) colliding at several tens of m s@xmath267 , since collisions between 10-km asteroids ( gravity - dominated fragmentation ) , on which information exists , occur at relative speeds of several km s@xmath267 .",
    "protoplanetary embryos grow by accreting planetesimals .",
    "accretion in differentially rotating disks is intrinsically complicated because of the three - body gravitational interaction of the two merging bodies and the central mass .",
    "one can however greatly simplify this problem by treating accretion as a two - body process while approximately taking into account three - body effects by limiting from below planetesimal approach velocity relative to the embryo by @xmath73 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the shear present in the disk .    with this in mind we can write a rather general formula for the protoplanetary mass accretion rate : @xmath320 where @xmath321 is the physical size of the embryo and the last equality holds for @xmath322 .",
    "dimensionless physical size of the core @xmath323 relative to its hill radius is independent of the core mass but varies with the distance from the sun : @xmath324 clearly , @xmath325 and @xmath213 .",
    "scattering of planetesimals by the embryo in the dispersion - dominated regime always tends to maintain @xmath326 , thus @xmath327    in the shear - dominated regime approach velocity @xmath63 is almost independent of planetesimal eccentricity or inclination and is @xmath328 .",
    "at the same time , vertical velocity of planetesimals @xmath74 setting the thickness of planetesimal disk is smaller than @xmath73 , and we find that @xmath329    derivation of equation ( [ eq : accr_rate_3d ] ) has implicitly assumed that the maximum impact parameter at infinity with which planetesimal can be accreted by the embryo @xmath330 is smaller than the planetesimal disk thickness @xmath331 . in the shear - dominated case , when @xmath332 , this sets a limit on the vertical velocity of planetesimals at which their accretion can still be described by equation ( [ eq : accr_rate_3d ] ) : @xmath333 ( greenberg 1991 ; dones & tremaine 1993 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : accr_rate_3d_sd ] ) is applicable only for @xmath334 .",
    "whenever @xmath335 planetesimal disk is very thin and embryo can accrete the whole vertical column of material it encounters ( eccentricity is only restricted to be smaller than @xmath169 ) . in this case one can easily show that @xmath336 this is the highest possible accretion rate of planetesimals by the protoplanetary core that can be achieved in the planetesimal disk .",
    "it is possible that most of the planetesimal mass has been concentrated in bodies with sizes of about @xmath337 km ( merger products in figure [ fig : mass_spectrum ] ) which interact with embryos in the dispersion - dominated regime . according to ( [ eq : accr_rate_3d_dd ] ) the growth timescale of the embryo due to the accretion of these bodies is @xmath338 using equations ( [ eq : smaller_offset ] ) , ( [ eq : vel_stokes ] ) , and ( [ eq : vel_epstein ] )",
    "we find that the time needed to build @xmath185 g protoplanetary core by accretion of such dispersion - dominated planetesimals is @xmath339 yr at 1 au , @xmath340 yr at 5 au , and @xmath341 yr at 30 au .    at the same time , as we hypothesized in ",
    "[ subsect : migration ] a fraction @xmath218 of planetesimal mass could have been in small bodies which are shear - dominated with respect to embryos . this mass is concentrated in a vertically thin population and comparing ( [ eq : i_eq_quad])-([eq : i_eq_epstein ] ) & ( [ eq : embryo_min_incl ] ) with ( [ eq : limit ] ) we find vertical velocity of planetesimals in the subdisk to be smaller than @xmath342 .",
    "thus , small shear - dominated bodies can be very efficiently consumed by embryos , and we find using ( [ eq : accr_rate_2d ] ) that the embryo s growth timescale due to their accretion is @xmath343 this is @xmath344 yr at 1 au , @xmath345 yr at 5 au , and @xmath346 yr at 30 au .",
    "thus , even if only about @xmath347 of the mass in solids is locked up in the shear - dominated planetesimals ( @xmath348 ) they would still dominate the accretion rate of the embryo because @xmath349 ! comparing ( [ eq : accr_rate_3d_dd ] ) and ( [ eq : accr_rate_2d ] ) with @xmath76 lowered by a factor of @xmath207 we find that accretion of small shear - dominated bodies from very thin disk is more important for embryo growth than accretion of large dispersion - dominated planetesimals whenever @xmath207 is such that condition ( [ eq : acc_separ ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the outlined picture of planetesimal dynamics in the gaseous nebula naturally divides planetesimals of different sizes into two well - defined populations with respect to gravitational scattering by a set of protoplanetary cores .",
    "one is a `` hot '' population of bodies bigger than @xmath187 km which interact with embryos in the dispersion - dominated regime and have large inclinations so that their scattering is an intrinsically three - dimensional process .",
    "the other is a `` cold '' population of smaller planetesimals ( sizes below 0.1 - 1 km ) which interact with embryos in the shear - dominated regime .",
    "these planetesimals tend to be confined by the action of the gas drag to a vertically thin disk [ with a thickness of @xmath350 near the nebular midplane .",
    "difference between these populations is most striking when the accretion of planetesimals by the embryos is concerned .",
    "accretion of dynamically hot planetesimals allows @xmath185 g embryo to double its mass in @xmath351 yr in the terrestrial planet region and in several @xmath352 yr in the region of ice giants .",
    "the latter timescale is quite long from the cosmogonical point of view .",
    "at the same time , accretion of cold planetesimals is about 100 times faster , with mass doubling timescale of @xmath353 yr and @xmath351 yr in the inner and outer parts of the nebula , provided that _ all _ solid mass is locked in these small planetesimals .",
    "formation of gaseous atmospheres around massive protoplanetary cores further accelerates accretion of small bodies : gaseous envelopes can be very efficient at trapping small planetesimals ( inaba & ikoma 2003 ) , thus increasing the capture radius @xmath321 and shortening the growth timescale .",
    "protoplanetary cores would also grow by merging with other cores ( since in our picture they reside on closely spaced orbits as long as @xmath354 , see  [ subsect : migration ] ) ; apparently , the faster cores grow , the closer their orbits are in the hill coordinates , and the faster they merge .    it is possible that most of the solid mass in the proto - solar nebula was concentrated from the very start in small ( @xmath355 m ) dynamically cold bodies . in this case",
    "@xmath356 and growth of embryos should be very fast , see equation ( [ eq : t_grow_sd ] ) .",
    "it is , however , equally possible that most of the mass was initially locked up in large ( @xmath337 km ) dispersion - dominated planetesimals and not in the dynamically cold population of small bodies , i.e. @xmath357 . in this case , although there is a huge reservoir of solid mass potentially available for the accretion , embryos can hardly make use of it because hot planetesimals are accreted rather inefficiently , see equation ( [ eq : t_grow_dd ] ) . at the same time , cold population which can potentially allow a vigorous growth of the embryo might simply not contain enough surface density to ensure high enough accretion rate ( accretion timescale is inversely proportional to the fraction of mass contained in small planetesimals , see [ [ eq : t_grow_sd ] ] ) .",
    "thus , unless enough mass ( @xmath358 ) is transferred from hot to cold planetesimals , embryos would grow slowly accreting large dispersion - dominated planetesimals .",
    "a natural process for transferring mass from the big bodies into small ones is planetesimal fragmentation ( see figure [ fig : mass_spectrum ] ) , which should naturally be taking place in the presence of massive embryos .",
    "indeed , the escape speed from the surface of 1 km body is about 1 m s@xmath267 , while the hill velocity of @xmath185 g embryo is @xmath359 m s@xmath267 at 1 au and is @xmath360 m s@xmath267 at 30 au .",
    "thus , 1-km planetesimals possibly containing most of the solid mass in the disk would collide with kinetic energy far exceeding their gravitational binding energy . depending on their internal strength",
    ", parent bodies can be disrupted into a number of smaller fragments in such collisions .",
    "collision strength is likely to be very small for objects in the outer solar system which are thought to be composed primarily of ices .",
    "comets are presumably the closest existing analogs of distant planetesimals and they are known to have small internal strength , e.g. from observations of tidal disruption of shoemaker - levy comet by jupiter ( greenberg 1995 ) .",
    "thus , it would be natural to expect that collisional fragmentation triggered by the dynamical excitation of planetesimals by massive protoplanetary cores readily occurs at least in the outer solar system .",
    "efficiency of fragmentation is set by the collision timescale @xmath301 of planetesimals with sizes in which most of the solid mass is concentrated .",
    "using ( [ eq : t_inel ] ) for 1 km bodies with @xmath217 and @xmath306 we estimate ( see  [ sect : lower ] ) , but this is partly compensated by the burst - like character of the fragmentation process , see below . ]",
    "it to be @xmath353 yr at 1 au and @xmath361 yr at 30 au .",
    "this might seem like a rather long timescale in the outer solar system but one should keep in mind that channeling just @xmath362 of mass into the population of cold planetesimals would increase the embryo s accretion rate by a factor of @xmath360 compared to the accretion of dispersion - dominated bodies , and this can be accomplished in a time 10 times shorter than @xmath301 , i.e. in about several myrs . note that according to ( [ eq : t_grow_sd ] ) the characteristic growth time of @xmath185 g embryo by accretion of small bodies is also several myrs for @xmath363 .",
    "growth time decreases as @xmath207 gradually goes up meaning that several myrs is a natural evolution timescale for such embryos in the outer solar system .",
    "we may conclude that if embryos grow mainly by accretion of small planetesimals then the planet formation timescale is intimately related to the timescale of fragmentation of massive planetesimals in catastrophic collisions .",
    "accretion rate and dynamics of protoplanetary cores would in the end depend on the details of the time evolution of the mass fraction in small planetesimals @xmath207 , see  [ subsect : migration ] and [ sect : accretion ] .",
    "scaling of @xmath207 with time would also determine whether inelastic collisions between small planetesimals are an important dynamical factor ; as we demonstrated in ",
    "[ subsect : inelastic ] , this can in some cases be an issue in the inner parts of the protoplanetary nebula .",
    "the amount of solid material contained in small planetesimals is determined by ( 1 ) the input of mass due to the fragmentation of large planetesimals , ( 2 ) the removal of mass via the accretion by embryos , and ( 3 ) the evolution of the surface density of small planetesimals due to the random scattering by embryos and their inward migration induced by the gas drag ( weidenschilling 1977 ; thommes 2003 ) .",
    "self - consistent calculation of @xmath207 has to combine all these contributions and is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "rapid accretion of small planetesimals can proceed provided that not only small bodies but also embryos themselves are on almost circular and uninclined orbits . as we have demonstrated in ",
    "[ subsect : migration ] , oligarchic growth allows simultaneous existence of many protoplanetary cores only if cores are lighter than about @xmath364 g ( at 1 au ) , since in that case their random motions can be kept small by planetesimal dynamical friction .",
    "the exact value of the maximum core mass at which dynamical stability is still possible sensitively depends on the amount of mass concentrated in small shear - dominated bodies , see  [ subsect : migration ] .",
    "after reaching this mass embryos would be dynamically excited ( @xmath365 ) and even if small planetesimals can still be kept confined to a cold , thin disk , embryo s accretion would proceed in the dispersion - dominated regime rather slowly ( because relative embryo - planetesimal velocity is increased above @xmath73 ) .",
    "discrete nature of the shear - dominated scattering of small planetesimals by the embryos is very important for accurate calculation of processes characterized by the energy threshold such as the disruption of small planetesimals in catastrophic collisions .",
    "usual continuous approximation suitable in the dispersion - dominated regime would not work in such cases because it characterizes planetesimal velocity by its average value which is either above or below the threshold , meaning that corresponding process is either always on or always off .",
    "in reality , planetesimal velocity changes continuously between the encounters with embryos from very large values ( about @xmath73 ) to very small ones . as a result",
    ", planetesimal velocity can be above the threshold for some time and during this period corresponding process would operate ( see figure [ fig : inclination ] ) . later on",
    "velocity would drop below the threshold and process would switch off .",
    "this is qualitatively different from what one would obtain using continuous description for the planetesimal scattering in the shear - dominated regime .",
    "for the fragmentation of small bodies this implies that planetesimal destruction in catastrophic collisions proceeds in bursts right after each passage of the embryo , when relative planetesimal velocities are high , but later on , when velocities are damped by the gas drag , collisions might not be energetic enough to continue fragmenting planetesimals .",
    "we have explored the details of planetesimal dynamics near protoplanetary embryos in the presence of gas drag .",
    "we showed that large ( @xmath0 km in size ) planetesimals are kept in the dispersion - dominated regime as a result of scattering by protoplanetary cores scattering , although their average velocities are reduced by the gas drag .",
    "bodies smaller than roughly @xmath187 km ( depending on the location in the nebula ) interact with protoplanetary cores in the shear - dominated regime . owing to the action of the gas drag these planetesimals",
    "settle into a geometrically thin layer near the nebular midplane ; between consecutive encounters with the embryos they experience strong velocity damping which allows them to approach embryos every time with the relative velocity comparable to the hill velocity  minimum velocity which can be achieved in a differentially rotating disk .    for different locations in the proto - solar nebula",
    "we have determined which planetesimals are only weakly affected by the gas drag and are in the dispersion - dominated regime , and which planetesimals are so strongly coupled to the gas that their velocities are below the hill velocity of the protoplanetary cores .",
    "dynamical peculiarities of the shear - dominated regime in the presence of gas lead to a very high efficiency of accretion of small bodies by the embryos .",
    "if the surface mass density of small bodies is high enough ( @xmath366 of the total surface density in solids ) their accretion would dominate the embryo s growth rate ( relative to the accretion of more massive , dispersion - dominated planetesimals ) .    large planetesimals ( @xmath0 km in size ) likely containing most of the mass in solids have large random velocities and are not very efficiently accreted by embryos .",
    "however , they inelastically collide with each other at high velocities and fragment into smaller pieces contributing to the population of small bodies . thus , the embryo s growth by accretion of small shear - dominated planetesimals can be regulated by the fragmentation of bigger , dispersion - dominated bodies .",
    "planetesimal fragmentation would probably be easiest in the outer solar system where colliding bodies are mostly composed of ices and are therefore internally weak and susceptible to easy destruction .",
    "the natural timescale for the growth of @xmath185 g protoplanetary embryos by accretion of small planetesimals turns out to be around several myrs at @xmath193 au from the sun .",
    "cores of ice giants can be formed in @xmath361 yr after large planetesimals lose all their mass in catastrophic collisions to small debris which can be effectively accreted by massive embryos .",
    "this scenario would work only if the population of protoplanetary cores formed as the outcome of oligarchic growth can be kept on almost non - inclined and circular orbits . as we demonstrated in ",
    "[ subsect : migration ] , this is possible only if embryo masses do not exceed a specific limit dictated by the efficiency of planetesimal dynamical friction , which sensitively depends on the planetesimal mass fraction @xmath207 locked up in small planetesimals and velocity of large dispersion - dominated planetesimals .    future work should address the issues of the self - consistent evolution of the mass fraction @xmath207 contained in small bodies ; the role of inelastic collisions using improved fragmentation physics ( can be an issue in the inner solar system ) ; the final fate of massive embryos which can not be kept dynamically cold by the planetesimal dynamical friction , and so on .",
