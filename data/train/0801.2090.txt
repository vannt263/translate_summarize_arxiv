    "the pioneering works of vishveshwara  @xcite , press  @xcite and davis , ruffini and tiomno  @xcite , unambiguously showed that a non - spherical gravitational perturbation of a schwarzschild black hole is radiated away via exponentially damped harmonic oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are interpreted as space - time vibrational modes .",
    "the properties of these _ quasi - normal modes _",
    "( qnms henceforth ) of black holes have been thoroughly studied since then ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "relativistic stars can also have space - time vibrational modes , the so - called @xmath0-modes  @xcite .",
    "these modes are purely relativistic and , contrary to fluid modes , are absent in newtonian theory .",
    "the fundamental @xmath0-mode frequency of a typical neutron star of radius  @xmath2 km and mass @xmath3 is expected to lie in the range of @xmath4 khz and to have a damping time of  @xmath5 s  @xcite .",
    "the issue of the excitation of @xmath0-modes in astrophysically motivated scenarios has been deeply investigated in the literature .",
    "andersson and kokkotas  @xcite showed that , in the odd - parity case , the scattering of a gaussian pulse of gravitational waves off a constant density non rotating star generates a waveform that , in close analogy with the black hole case , is characterized by three phases : ( i ) a precursor , mainly related to the choice of the initial data and determined by the backscattering of the background curvature while the pulse is entering in the gravitational field of the star ; ( ii ) a burst ; ( iii ) a ring - down phase dominated by @xmath0-modes , whose presence was inferred by looking at the fourier spectrum of the signals . since the star is non - rotating , the signal eventually dies out with a power - law tail typical of schwarzschild space - time  @xcite .",
    "allen and coworkers  @xcite and ruoff  @xcite addressed , by means of time - domain perturbative analysis , the same problem in the even - parity case , focusing on gravitational wave scattering scenarios .",
    "they considered a large sample of initial configurations as well as star models of different compaction .",
    "their main findings were : ( i ) @xmath0-modes are present only for non - conformally flat initial data ( i.e. , some radiative field needs to be injected in the system ) and ( ii ) the strength of the @xmath0-mode signal depends on the compaction of the star .",
    "these pioneering studies were later extended or refined in refs .",
    "in particular , refs .",
    "@xcite considered the scattering off the star of particles moving along open orbits and realized that the @xmath0-mode excitation strongly depends on the orbital parameters : the closer the turning point of the orbit is to the star ( i.e. , the higher is the frequency of the gravitational wave instantaneously emitted by the particle ) , the larger is the presence of @xmath0-modes .",
    "consistently , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that ( modulo a simplified treatment of the star surface ) if the source of perturbation is a spatially extended axisymmetric distribution of fluid matter ( like a quadrupolar shell ) plunging on the star , the @xmath0-modes are not excited , but the energy spectrum is dominated by low - frequency contributions due to curvature backscattering . in addition , ref .",
    "@xcite addressed the late - time decay of the _ trapped _",
    "mode for ultra - compact , highly relativistic constant density stars .",
    "the presence of trapped @xmath0-modes in stars with a first - order phase transition ( a density discontinuity ) was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze the problem of @xmath0-modes excitation in relativistic stars ( in the perturbative regime ) by emphasizing the analogies with the black hole case . for a given odd - parity gravitational wave multipole @xmath6",
    ", we consider the scattering of gaussian pulses of gravitational radiation of different width @xmath1 off relativistic stars ( either with constant density or with a polytropic equation of state ) of 1.4 @xmath7 and we contrast such signals with those emitted by a non - rotating black hole of the same mass .",
    "we focus on the excitation of space - time modes as a function of the width @xmath1 of the gaussian .",
    "we find that space - times modes can be clearly identified only if the gaussian wave - packet is sufficiently narrow ( i.e. , small @xmath1 ) . on the other hand , for large wave - packets the internal structure of the object",
    "is unaffected by the perturbation , tail effects are dominating and the gravitational waveforms generated by stars or black holes are practically identical .",
    "from the spherically symmetric line element in schwarzschild coordinates @xmath8 by assuming the stress energy tensor of a perfect fluid as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pressure and @xmath11 the total energy density of the star , the einstein equations reduce to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations of stellar equilibrium : @xmath12 since we are using schwarzschild coordinates , we also have that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass contained in a sphere of radius @xmath15 .",
    "this system of equations needs , to be solved , the specification of an equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we use the simplest two : the constant density eos and an adiabatic eos in the form @xmath16 .",
    "we consider two polytropic models ( named a and b ) and two constant energy density models ( a@xmath17 and b@xmath17 ) with the same compactness .",
    "all the models share the same mass @xmath18 , and their specific properties are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "if not differently stated , we use geometrized units @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] from up to down the rows report : the polytropic constant @xmath21 , the adiabatic index @xmath22 , the mass of the star @xmath23 , its radius @xmath24 , the central pressure @xmath25 , the central total energy density @xmath26 and the compaction parameter @xmath27 , for all the stellar models considered . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the reasons outlined above we have found this procedure not as effective as we hoped .",
    "we think that the problem of the unambiguous determination of the `` right '' time interval for the fit and of the presence and quantification the overtones in numerical data deserves further considerations .",
    "in this paper we have studied numerically the scattering of odd - parity gaussian pulses of gravitational radiation off relativistic stars and black holes .",
    "we have found that the excitation of @xmath0-modes and black hole qnms occurs basically in the same way for both objects : pulses of small @xmath1 ( high frequencies ) can trigger the @xmath0-modes , while for large @xmath1 ( low frequencies ) one can only find curvature backscattering effects and non - oscillatory tails .",
    "when @xmath0-modes are present , we have shown that both frequency - domain ( energy spectrum ) and time - domain ( fit to a superposition of @xmath0-modes ) analysis are useful to understand the mode content of the waveforms ; however , our study also indicates that it is difficult to single out _",
    "precisely _ the contribution of each mode , since the fundamental mode always dominates the signal and a clear identification of the overtones is lacking in the case of excitation induced by the scattering of odd - parity gaussian pulses of gravitational radiation .",
    "the inspiring idea of this paper was to understand the origin of the dynamical excitation of @xmath0-modes in a simple , but rather general , setting , where it is possible to do many , quick and controllable high - accuracy numerical simulations with a tunable `` source '' .",
    "our expectation is that the main features of the process of @xmath0-mode excitation ( i.e. , its dependence on the intrinsic frequency content of the initial data ) that we have highlighted in the perturbative regime are sufficiently robust to survive _ qualitatively _ also in the full 3d - nonlinear case that needs the solution of the full set of einstein equations .",
    "an encouraging motivation for hoping so is that in other physical settings , like for example the merger of two equal mass black holes , the perturbative analysis of the early 70s  @xcite in the extreme mass ratio limit was able to single out the important physical elements ( i.e. , the presence of qnms ) , sketching a picture that has been later refined , but substantially confirmed , by numerical relativity simulations  @xcite .",

    "the commercial software matlab@xmath28 has been used for most of the analysis reported here .",
