    "in the standard scenario , neutron stars ( nss ) are formed during the core collapse of massive stars which links their number in the galaxy to the galactic supernova rate .",
    "the number of galactic nss can be inferred from observations , taking the various manifestation of nss into account . in recent years",
    ", new and different observational manifestions of nss have been discovered , so that it is warranted to study the impact , if any , of these discoveries onto the birthrates that is required to sustain this increased ns population .",
    "the new manifestations of nss include rotating radio transients ( rrats ; mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 ) and x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ; see haberl 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "these objects join the @xmath0 known radio pulsars and the small group of magnetars  @xcite . do these previously unknown types of observable nss increase the overall population by an amount that it is difficult to reconcile the formation rates with those predicted by theory ?",
    "the basic requirement we make to answer this question is that the individual birthrates of the different ns populations should not exceed the galactic core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) rate , i.e. @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the birthrate ( per century ) of a ns of type x.    recently , this question has also been addressed by  @xcite where it was concluded that this requirement can be met if we assume that xdinss are in fact nearby rrats . however , as we detail below , the pulsar birthrate considered is a lower limit which has since been superceded . in addition",
    ", the recent non - detection of any radio rrat - like bursts from the xdinss  @xcite means that the identification of these two populations is not certain .",
    "furthermore recent work suggests that the heretofore neglected magnetar contribution may not be negligible so that the question as to whether the ccsn rate requirement is satisfied is reinstated .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the posed question by investigating the most recent knowledge about each contributing ns population and its galactic birthrate . after introducing each manifestation of ns in turn",
    ", we will revisit the estimates for all terms in eqn .  .",
    "the results are then discussed in detail before conclusions are drawn .",
    "radio pulsars are rapidly rotating , highly magnetised nss .",
    "coherent radio emission is produced by a pair plasma above the magnetic polar caps of the ns , believed to orginiate from particle cascades after an acceleration of electrons and positrons in the strong electric and magnetic fields ( e.g.  lorimer & kramer 2005 ) .",
    "the spectra for this emission typically increases with decreasing radio frequency with mean spectral index of @xmath3  @xcite before peaking in the range @xmath4 mhz  @xcite .",
    "pulsar periods range from 1.4 ms up to 8.5 s with two distinct distributions - the `` normal '' radio pulsars which have periods of @xmath5 ms and the so - called ` millisecond pulsars ' with typical periods of @xmath6 ms .",
    "figure 1 shows a @xmath7 diagram , a standard pulsar classification tool , where these two populations are easily identified .",
    "the standard model of pulsar physics assumes pulsars have dipolar magnetic fields and that the loss of rotational energy powers the pulsar . with these",
    "we can determine the `` characteristic surface magnetic field '' of the pulsar to be @xmath8 which assumes canonical ns values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 km , a moment of inertia of @xmath11 and an orthogonal rotator ( e.g.  lorimer & kramer 2005 ) . assuming a spin - down law of the form @xmath12 and that pulsars are born spinning much faster than what we currently observe ( i.e. @xmath13 ) we can determine a spin - down age of @xmath14 for a pure dipole , the ` braking index ' @xmath15 , resulting in the `` characteristic age '' @xmath16 .",
    "we can also define the pulsar `` spin - down luminosity '' @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "assuming again the canonical ns values , we find @xmath18 lines of constant @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are shown in figure 1 along with different evolutionary paths for different braking indices .",
    "the lower right area of the diagram devoid of any pulsars is known as the pulsar ` death valley '  @xcite .",
    "it is here that it is believed that the electric potential at the polar caps is insufficient for ripping particles from the ns surface , hence failing to provide the plasma needed for radio emission .",
    "diagram showing the various ns populations .",
    "the 4 xdinss and 8 rrats without a known @xmath22 are placed at the top right at their respective periods .",
    "arrows indicate the current spin evolution of those sources for which a braking index has been measured ( figure provided by c. espinoza ) . ]      the standard evolutionary picture for millisecond pulsars ( e.g.  alpar et al .",
    "1982 ) is that they are born in supernovae with periods of 10s of milliseconds , then evolve along a line of approximately constant magnetic field strength ( i.e. @xmath15 ) on the @xmath7 diagram , slowing down until eventually radio emission ceases once they pass into the pulsar death valley . here",
    ", those ` dead ' pulsars which happen to be in binary systems can undergo accretion from their binary companion .",
    "this accretion can heat areas of the ns surface ( ` hot spots ' ) which emit strongly in x - rays - the system is now an x - ray binary system .",
    "as well as heating the star the accretion can spin up the star to periods of a few milliseconds .",
    "the pulsar is now reborn as a millisecond pulsar and once again is seen to emit as a radio pulsar . in what follows",
    "we do not consider the nss which are millisecond pulsars or those seen in x - ray binaries as this standard evolutionary picture sees these two populations as originating from ` normal ' radio pulsars .",
    "their birthrates should thus be accounted for in the pulsar birthrate .",
    "however we note that if some nss in x - ray binaries did not originate from the normal radio pulsars the problem outlined below may be emphasised even further .",
    "the discovery of eleven rrat sources was made ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 )   from single pulse searches of the 1.4-ghz parkes multi - beam pulsar survey ( pmps ) ( manchester et al . 2001 )  .",
    "these are distant ( @xmath23 kpc ) , transient sources which emit single radio bursts .",
    "the burst arrival times are stochastic in some sources with others showing distinct on - off states ( m. a. mclaughlin , private communication ) .",
    "the times between bursts range from 4 min to 3 hr with typical burst rates @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the bursts are narrow ( @xmath26 ms ) and rather bright ( with peak flux densities of @xmath27 jy ) and thus have high brightness temperatures of @xmath28 k. these values are higher for the rrats than all known sources except for the giant radio pulses and nano - giant pulses emitted by the crab pulsar which have @xmath29 k  @xcite and @xmath30 k  @xcite , respectively",
    ".    continued observations of these sources have enabled underlying periodicities to be determined in all eleven sources and period derivatives to be determined for three sources .",
    "periods in the range @xmath31 s are seen which suggests a ns origin .",
    "this seems to be confirmed from x - ray observations of the most prolific source - rrat j1819@xmath321458 . using first chandra ( reynolds et al .",
    "2006 )   and then xmm newton ( mclaughlin et al . 2007 )   a thermal x - ray spectrum ( characteristic of a cooling ns ) with @xmath33 ev was found , as well as x - ray pulsations at the identical period as determined from the radio observations .",
    "we can place the three sources with known period derivative on the @xmath7 diagram and estimate their surface magnetic field strength using eqn .",
    "the magnetic field strengths are in the range of the normal radio pulsars ( @xmath34 g ) except for j1819@xmath321458 which lies between the normal pulsars and the magnetars with @xmath35 g. the discovery of a spectral feature in the x - ray spectrum of j1819@xmath321458 ( which may be due to proton cyclotron resonant scattering ) seems to support this estimate  @xcite .",
    "the xdinss are a small group of radio - quiet , close - by ( @xmath36 pc ) x - ray pulsars situated in the gould belt , a local , partial ring of stars which includes the sun ( poppel , 1997 ) .",
    "xdinss were originally discovered over a decade ago  @xcite with seven sources now known ( sometimes referred to as `` the magnificent seven '' ) .",
    "xdinss have thermal x - ray spectra with @xmath37 ev and show x - ray pulsations with periods in the range @xmath38 s  @xcite .",
    "all seven sources have determined periods with three well known period derivatives and upper limits for three more ( see tables 1 & 3 in haberl 2007 , tiengo & mereghetti 2007 , van kerkwijk & kaplan 2008 ) .",
    "however the upper limits determined are @xmath39 orders of magnitude higher than the three well known @xmath22 values so may not be very constraining .",
    "we can place the three sources with known @xmath22 on the @xmath7 diagram and can determine @xmath40 g in the standard way .",
    "these 3 sources lie just below the magnetars .",
    "the x - ray spectra of xdinss can be fit well with a single blackbody and interestingly do not require a power - law component which suggests that xdinss do not have magnetospheres .",
    "also , as for rrats there are observed spectral features which may be due to proton - cyclotron lines in a strong magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we note that there is much current work underway , searching for rrat - like bursty emission from xdinss .",
    "however , no emission has been found above a flux density limit of @xmath41 @xmath42 ( kondratiev et al .",
    "2008 ) from 820-mhz observations with the green - bank telescope .",
    "in addition there has been no detection with gmrt at 320 mhz ( b. c. joshi , private communication ) .",
    "searches are also underway using the parkes telescope at 1.4 ghz ( a. possenti , private communication ) .",
    "these non - detections suggest that the identification of xdinss as nearby rrats  @xcite might be incorrect .",
    "it is thought that both soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) belong to the magnetar class of nss  @xcite .",
    "magnetars are believed to be isolated x - ray pulsars with strong magnetic fields ( @xmath43 g ) and periods in the range @xmath44 s and were , until recently , thought to be radio - silent .",
    "however transient radio emission has been detected from two axps - xte j1810@xmath32197  @xcite and 1e 1547.0@xmath325408 ( camilo et al .",
    "2008 ) with both sources showing flat radio spectra .",
    "this is different to what is seen in normal radio pulsars ( see section  [ sec : pulsar ] ) .",
    "magnetic fields inferred again from the observed spin and spin - down rates are shown for magnetars in the same @xmath7 diagram in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] .",
    "recently , the ccsn rate ( for type ib , ic and type ii sne ) has been determined from measurements of @xmath45-ray radiation from @xmath46al in the galaxy ( diehl et al .",

    "; stahler & palla 2004 )  , we determine a ccsn rate of as high as @xmath57/century if we use a salpeter - like high mass imf ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "while this is consistent with the rate of diehl et al .",
    ", it has been suggested that the observed salpeter - like imf may be artificially large at high masses due to the effect of unresolved binaries  @xcite , so that a steeper scalo - like imf is more realistic in the high mass range of interest here . in this case",
    "we obtain a lower ccsn rate of just @xmath59/century . in both cases here",
    "we have assumed the error to be dominated by the uncertainty of the sfr of up to @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the most thoroughly studied ns population is that of radio pulsars .",
    "a recent estimate of the birthrate and the number of radio pulsars in the galaxy was performed by lorimer et al ( 2006 )   ( l+06 from herein ) using 1008 non - recyced pulsars detected in 1.4-ghz surveys using the parkes telescope ( the pmps and the parkes high - lattitude survey ) . using a pulsar current analysis they determind population details for sources above a 1.4-ghz radio luminosity threshold of @xmath61 .",
    "pulsar current analyses use the fact that the typical age of pulsars are much shorter than the age of the galaxy so that the pulsar population can be considered to be in a steady - state .",
    "the flow of pulsars across the @xmath7 diagram can thus be considered a `` current '' obeying a continuity equation  @xcite .",
    "this current , @xmath62 , equals the pulsar birth rate minus the pulsar death rate in the period range @xmath63 .",
    "thus the maximum value of @xmath62 equals @xmath64 but as we have a flux limited sample of the pulsar population , the maximum value of @xmath62 provides only a lower limit to the pulsar birthrate .",
    "the results obtained have model dependencies on the galactic electron density model and on the pulsar beaming fraction model .",
    "the current best model for the electron density is the ne2001 model  @xcite and this was adopted as well as the taurus & manchester ( 1998 ) beaming model . l+06",
    "determine a birthrate of @xmath65/century and @xmath66 .",
    "this result is consistent with the earlier work of vranesevic et al .",
    "2004   ( v+04 from herein ) which used 815 non - recycled pmps pulsars to determine @xmath67/century and @xmath68 in this case determined above a higher threshold of @xmath69 . in both cases the now superceded tc93  @xcite electron density model was also used and for both analyses this produces lower birthrate estimates .",
    "more recent work by  @xcite ( fk06 from herein ) yields a much higher pulsar birthrate of @xmath70/century .",
    "the approach of this analysis is different - the authors model the birth properties of pulsars ( velocity distributions , magnetic fields and detectability in the pmps and swinburne multi - beam surveys ) from the observational data before performing monte carlo simulations to evolve the initial population to obtain the observed pulsar sample .",
    "the quoted birthrate is the average of 50 runs of their simulations . while it is twice as large as that provided by the pulsar current analyses the results are entirely consistent as the pulsar current analysis is to be interpreted as providing a lower limit to the pulsar birthrate .",
    "the estimated number of rrats is @xmath71 ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 ) and therefore even higher than that of the radio pulsar population ( see section 5 for discussion of the various parameters on which this estimate depends ) .",
    "however , the determination of @xmath72 is obviously based on a very small sample of sources . in order to account for this uncertainty , we will use the following parameterisation in our computations , i.e.  @xmath73 where we take @xmath74 .",
    "it is important to realise the following caveat when interpreting this estimate for the total number of rrats .",
    "the fact that it appears to be larger than that of pulsars does not necessarily imply that a ns is more likely to be a rrat than a pulsar .",
    "this would assume that the physical mechanisms for the emission of the rrat radio bursts is identical to that of regular pulsars .",
    "there is no reason to assume this , especially as rrat spectra are as yet unknown .",
    "emission criteria ( which may represent certain `` active '' areas on the @xmath7 diagram ) for rrat and pulsar emission may be different and the respective `` death - lines '' may also be different , so that the duration of rrat and pulsar emitting phases would not be the same either . here lies the advantage of considering birthrates ( e.g. pulsar current analyses ) rather than absolute population numbers  @xcite .",
    "however , as we do not have a reliable age estimator for rrats , we are forced to assume similar active lifetimes for rrats and pulsars to work out birthrates from population estimates .",
    "we could conceivably use temperature as a measure age ( see section 5 ) but as there is just one rrat with known temperature we follow popov et al . ( 2006 ) who have argued that if rrats are rotating nss with pulsar - scale magnetic fields then the active lifetime of pulsars @xmath75 yr would be similar to that of rrats , @xmath76 .",
    "this holds provided the initial spin periods of rrats and pulsars are within a factor of a few of each other . with the conclusion of approximately equal time - scales and @xmath73",
    ", this implies a rrat birthrate of @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "thus if we take @xmath78 we have an indicative rrat birthrate of @xmath79/century considering the pulsar current analyses , or as large as @xmath80/century considering the fk06 result .",
    "the birthrate for xdinss has recently been estimated by  @xcite .",
    "these authors performed a population synthesis for xdinss based on the seven xdinss detected in the rosat all - sky survey ( voges et al .",
    "a limiting volume for ob progenitor stars was determined and then compared to the actual number of ob stars detected in this volume in the survey for the relevant scalings .",
    "the authors then use an age estimate to find birthrates from the simulated number of sources and determine @xmath81/century .",
    "the age estimate is arrived at simply from averaging the characteristic age for the two xdinss which then had well - known @xmath22 s ( @xmath82 & @xmath83 myr ) , and earlier estimates for their ns cooling ages ( @xmath84 myr ) .",
    "the result is consistent with a recent lower estimate of @xmath85/century made by  @xcite which used a ns cooling age of @xmath86 myr .",
    "magnetar birthrates have typically been determined using two different methods of age estimation , required to convert simulated populations to birthrates .",
    "the first method uses spin - down age estimates for magnetars , as used by kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1998 )   to determine an sgr birthrate of @xmath87/century which we consider as a lower limit for the magnetar birthrate  @xcite .",
    "an axp birthrate was calculated similarly by  @xcite using the same population synthesis methods as for the xdinss , obtaining @xmath88/century .",
    "another very recent determination of @xmath89/century has also just been reported by ferrario & wickramasinghe ( 2008 ) .",
    "the second means by which magnetar age estimates can be obtained , involves using ages of supernova remnant associations of sgrs and axps .",
    "these have yielded slightly smaller estimates ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1995 ) as the supernova remnant ages tend to be longer than the spin - down ages resulting in a smaller birthrate .    due to these small magnetar birthrate estimates relative to the other populations of nss , one might think that we can safely neglect the magnetar contribution to eqn .  . however , we note the possibility that if , for example , magnetars experience magnetic field decay ( as considered by  @xcite and by  @xcite ) the true age is smaller than the characteristic age .",
    "this would imply a higher birthrate , possibly as high as @xmath90/century for axps  @xcite .",
    "in addition , larger magnetar birthrate estimates have been reported recently by muno et al .",
    "these authors studied 947 archival observations from xmm newton and chandra .",
    "from the 7 magnetars detected they determine the most likely number of galactic magnetars considering the small fraction of the sky covered in these observations .",
    "they obtain , separately , birthrates for persistent axps , transient axps as well as a small contribution from sgrs yielding a large magnetar birthrate of @xmath91/century .",
    "this however assumes lifetimes of @xmath92 yr ( see figure 1 ) for each of these sub - populations . as the lifetime for transient axps is very uncertain it",
    "is possible that their lifetime is larger by an order of magnitude . in this case",
    "the persistent axps give the most reliable magnetar birthrate of @xmath93/century .",
    "it is not clear if the question of beaming has been considered in the estimates of muno et al .",
    "but we should not necessarily expect magnetar emission to be isotropic . in this case , only magentars beamed toward us will have been detected . however , judging from the observed pulse shapes  ( e.g.  woods & thompsson 2004 ) , we assume that the beaming fraction is larger than for radio pulsars , so that the effect of beaming may not be quite as significant as for pulsars . nevertheless noting that the derived values may represent a lower limit , we proceed by neglecting this extra beaming factor and considering all the estimates reviewed here we adopt a conservative magnetar birthrate of @xmath94/century where our extended error bars allow for the potentially much higher values suggested by the muno et al . study .

    "the birthrates for each of the ns populations are summarised below in table 1 and figure 2 .",
    "it appears that the ccsn rate can not sustain all the separate ns populations . in a previous consideration of this question by popov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , xdinss and rrats were identified as a single ns population , so that only one birthrate contribution was taken , i.e.  that of the xdinss . moreover , the magnetar contribution was neglected and an xdins birthrate was assumed such that @xmath95 .",
    "in addition , popov et al .  used the lower limit pulsar birthrate of v+04 to be the pulsar birthrate , a result since superceded by the work of fk06 . in this picture , where xdinss are identified with nearby rrats , the total birthrate is @xmath96/century which is barely consistent with the ccsn rate .",
    "however , including the magnetars , allowing for separate rrat and xdins contributions and using the more accurate pulsar birthrate of fk06 , eqn .   can not be satisfied with the estimates from table 1 .",
    "this seems to be the case even if we assume the highest ccsn rate allowable within the uncertainties ( i.e.  @xmath97/century ) while at the same time allowing for the lowest required total required ns birthrate , @xmath98/century .",
    "it seems that the number of nss produced via ccsne is not sufficient .",
    "we can just about reconcile the rates if we choose the highest allowable ccsn rate and the lowest allowable total ns birthrate from the l+06 result using the tc93 electron density model ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , as we discussed earlier , the pulsar current results are lower limits and the ne2001 model is often considered to be a more accurate model than tc93 @xcite ,    from looking at figure 2 we are left to conclude that either the individual ns birthrates are over - estimated ( or the uncertainties in these values are under - estimated )",
    ". to reconcile the values within the errors would require the rrat and xdinss errors ( which recall are the most uncertain ) to be under - estimated by a factor of 2 .",
    "if this is not the case then it would seem that eqn .",
    "is not satisfied .",
    "taking this at face value implies that there are too many nss in the galaxy .",
    "we will discuss the nature of this potential ns `` birthrate problem '' in the following .",
    "in trying to determine some possible solutions to the birthrate problem we consider in the following the possibility that the various birthrates are incorrect or that there is an evolutionary answer .",
    "some possible conclusions include :    _ ( 1 ) the pulsar birthrate is wrong : _ the pulsar birthrate is the most crucial component of our discussion as pulsars are the most well studied population and the rrat birthrate depends on that of the pulsars .",
    "thankfully , the pulsar birthrate estimates are by far the most accurate .",
    "the pulsar current analyses make no assumptions and are `` model free '' even though they depend on the galactic electron density distribution and the beaming fraction .",
    "the lower limits obtained from them are thus quite secure . in order to compensate for the flux limited nature of these studies",
    ", we would need to to choose a functional form for the luminosity ( depending on @xmath99 and @xmath22 ) but the inclusion of such a correction can only increase the determined birthrate .",
    "the work of fk06 models this luminosity evolution across the @xmath7 diagram as well as many other birth properties ( modelled from the observed pulsar population ) .",
    "the analysis did assume magnetic dipole spin - down of pulsars but allowed for magnetic field decay as well as drawing braking indices from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath100 $ ] ( note that the few measured braking indices are found to lie in the range @xmath101 , see lyne & graham - smith ( 2004 ) ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another uncertainty for pulsars is the beaming fraction .",
    "an indication of this may be the recent discovery of a pulsar with an extremely small duty cycle ( keith et al .",
    "this pulsar has a beaming fraction of just @xmath102 or only @xmath103 of longitude .",
    "usually , we would expect the minimum pulse width ( for an orthogonal rotator ) for this pulsar period of @xmath104 ms to be given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the emission height and we have assumed @xmath107 , the impact parameter , to be small . what is observed is a pulsar that is narrower by a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "it is possible that the pulse represents a cut at the very edge of the conical beam but this seems to be at odds with the two observed distinct components in the pulse profile ( keith et al .",
    "pulsars with pulse widths this narrow therefore raise the question whether or not our beaming fraction estimates are accurate .",
    "if they are in fact over - estimates then there may be many more pulses which we do not see .    in summary",
    ", taking the pulsar current analysis to provide a reliable lower limit it seems indeed reasonable to take a pulsar birthrate of @xmath108/century as being quite conservative when the many low luminosity pulsars are included .",
    "_ ( 2 ) the rrat birthrate is wrong and hugely over - estimated : _ the rrat birthrate depends on the rrat population estimate being correct .",
    "this is based on assumptions that the galactic distribution of rrats follows that of pulsars , on assumptions about the impact of man - made radio frequency interference ( rfi ) during the analysis of the pmps data as well as on beaming and galactic electron distribution models used and on rrat burst rate estimates .",
    "the full expression for the number of rrats includes a factor for each of these input assumptions and is given by ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the fraction of rrats which were `` on '' during a 35-min pmps observation , @xmath111 is the fraction of rrats not missed due to rfi .",
    "@xmath112 is the beaming fraction where , due to recent studies , a modification to the equation has been made ( lorimer , private communication ) .",
    "all of these effects are treated conservatively but to really improve the accuracy of the estimate , we need to discover many more sources .",
    "this will enable us to accurately determine the factors in this equation .",
    "the `` on''-factor can be best constrained with accurate rrat burst rates for a larger population of rrats .",
    "the rfi factor is more difficult to quantify but recently we have made progress in this regard with the development of a new rfi removal scheme which is capable of removing the vast majority of terrestrial rfi ( eatough et al . in prep ) .",
    "the rfi removal means that we will be able to essentially ignore the @xmath111-factor ( i.e. @xmath113 ) .",
    "a re - processing of the pmps data applying this superior rfi scheme is underway and will eventually enable us to detect all rrats that were originally overlooked due to rfi contamination .",
    "this will yield a more accurate value of @xmath72 and the results of this will be reported later .",
    "an uncertainty of the beaming fraction of radio pulsars also affects rrats as we have , as the best available assumption , adopted a beaming fraction as observed for long period pulsars .",
    "if the beams are narrower then this increases the estimate for the number of rrats .",
    "the rrat lifetime is another uncertain parameter . if one were to propose a much larger active lifetime than that proposed by popov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) this would reduce the implied rrat birthrate . however even if this were an order of magnitude larger ( i.e. @xmath114 myr ) the birthrate problem would remain although less emphatic . conversely we note that the rrats seem to have higher @xmath22 values than most pulsars and thus may evolve to higher periods ( i.e. towards the death valley ) more quickly than pulsars which would then imply a shorter lifetime than that assumed above . noting all of these caveats",
    ", it does not seem unreasonable to take , as a conservative estimate , @xmath115/century for @xmath116 as before .",
    "_ ( 3 ) the xdins birthrate is wrong and hugely over - estimated : _ like in the case of rrats this could be due to the small sample size of this population .",
    "furthermore some of the xdins birthrate estimates assume spin - down ages to be an accurate age estimate and there are only three xdinss with well known @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , the estimate of  @xcite also depends on the used galactic @xmath117 model , i.e.  the authors applied an exponential model ( ignoring any warp or spiral arm components ) .",
    "long - term monitoring of the known xdinss can yield exact period derivatives which in turn will give us accurate characteristic ages which , along with ns cooling ages , may enable us to determine the true age of xdinss . certainly , however , as for rrats , the best way to improve the used estimates is to increase the known population of xdinss .",
    "recent work to determine where best to search for these elusive sources , has pointed towards the cygnus - cepheus region behind the gould belt ( posselt et al .",
    "2008 ) .    _",
    "( 4 ) a possible evolution from different types of nss into others : _ we consider here the possibility that pulsars , rrats and xdinss might be different evolutionary stages of a single class of object .",
    "if this is the case , we need only take one birthrate for these populations into balancing the ccsn rate , i.e.  the birthrate of the earliest stage in this cycle . to determine the direction of this evolution requires a reliable age estimator .",
    "as all of the considered nss are isolated objects , we expect that they simply slow down as they age , so that the longer periods of xdinss ( @xmath118 s ) , compared with those of the rrats ( @xmath31 s ) , imply rrats to be younger than xdinss .",
    "similarly , the even lower periods of isolated pulsars ( @xmath119 s ) might imply that the evolutionary track in question is pulsar@xmath120rrat@xmath120xdins . to investigate this possibility , we performed kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests comparing the cumulative period probability distributions ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the probability that the pulsar and rrat distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution is found to be @xmath121 .",
    "however , we believe the comparison to be unfair due to the large difference in distribution sizes ( 1500 and 11 ) . to test this",
    "we randomly selected 20 pulsar periods from their period distribution and compared these with the rrat distribution over many iterations .",
    "the resulting probabilities vary largely with @xmath122 of iterations showing probabilities below @xmath123 but @xmath124 of iterations showing probabilities above @xmath125 . next we compared the median periods of the randomly selected pulsar samples to that of the rrats .",
    "this value is stable with the median pulsar period being @xmath126 ms over 10,000 iterations .",
    "the rrat median period is @xmath127 above this value considering 16 known rrats ( the 11 original sources plus 5 newly detected sources , m. mclaughlin , private communication ) and @xmath128 considering only the published sources . from this",
    "we conclude that rrat periods are intrinsically longer than those of the pulsars .",
    "comparing the rrat and xdins distributions using the k - s test gives a probability that these two distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution of only @xmath129 but not low enough to reject this possibility given the small numbers in each category ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) .",
    "if we nevertheless assume these distributions to be different , we can estimate the time needed for the rrat period distribution to evolve to the xdins period distribution by comparing the average period and the period derivatives .",
    "the average periods are , respectively , @xmath132 s and @xmath133 s. using the average rrat period derivative of @xmath134 and assuming that it is constant with time , we estimate an evolutionary time of @xmath135        another indicator of age is temperature , assuming that no significant heating occurs during the life of any of these sources . assuming nss are born with the same temperature and then cool along a ns cooling curve , we can determine the age if the surface temperature can be measured .",
    "however , ns cooling curves are not very well constrained ( as they often depend on the unknown ns equation - of - state , e.g.  yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) so that the exact age - temperature relationship is not known .",
    "still , we can safely expect an older star to be cooler than a young ns , so that we might suppose xdinss to be cooler than rrats as xdinss have @xmath136 k  @xcite and rrat j1819@xmath321458 has @xmath137 k , lending tentative support to our conclusion based upon periods .",
    "if some / all rrats do evolve into xdinss it means the xdins birthrate can be removed from consideration in balancing eqn .  .",
    "we note that a ns evolution from rrat to xdins suggests a path on the @xmath7 diagram ( along , say , an @xmath15 line ) which starts in the region of the high - b radio pulsars .",
    "such an evolution where rrats and xdinss are evolutionary states reached by some of the normal radio pulsars means both of these birthrate contributions can be removed from eqn .",
    "and the birthrate problem is much less severe and is solved within the errors of @xmath64 and @xmath138 .",
    "this of course does not include the magnetar contribution . if the magnetar birthrate is in fact small , it is not necessary to include magnetars in an evolutionary scenario to solve the problem but nonetheless we consider it . comparing the magnetar period distribution to that of rrats and",
    "xdinss suggests that the xdinss and magnetar distributions are quite similar .",
    "a k - s test finds their distributions to be the same with a @xmath139 probability .",
    "this might suggest that the xdins and magnetar evolutionary end states come from the same initial population .",
    "such a scenario with some high - b radio pulsars evolving towards the magnetar region of the @xmath7 diagram involves increasing @xmath20 . while at first this may seem counter - intuitive we note that eqn .",
    "( 2 ) describes the surface magnetic field which could indeed increase with time .",
    "in fact , this is suggested by long term observations of the crab pulsar and psr b1737@xmath3230  @xcite , and by the measured braking indices from young pulsars as @xmath140 .    _",
    "( 5 ) an unknown ns formation process : _ another ( even more drastic ) solution might be that there is some other unknown mechanism of forming nss besides ccsne .",
    "this might well be required even if there is an evolutionary answer to the birthrate problem because , as we have noted , the number of pulsars alone is pushing the allowed limit .",
    "the only other known mechanisms for forming nss are electron - capture sne  @xcite and an accretion induced collapse ( aic )  @xcite .",
    "while stellar modelling results  @xcite had seen electron - capture sne only possible in close binary systems3039b , was formed in this way . ] , some very recent work has examined this process in isolated stars ( poelarends et al .",
    "the results suggest that electron capture sne likely account for just @xmath141 of all sne ( i.e. not just cc sne ) which increases the number of galactic nss but only by a small amount .",
    "aic is a process naturally only occurring in binary systems but here we consider only isolated nss so this process can not resolve the problem .",
    "it would seem that another as yet unknown ns formation mechanism would be required .",
    "in this work we have presented a detailed and critical review of the current state of birthrate calculations for a number of ns manifestions .",
    "based on this review , we suggest that the current ccsn rate can not explain the birthrates of the various ns populations . unless new birthrate estimates emerge which differ vastly from those discussed here we have a birthrate problem . if this is the case we favour an evolutionary interpretation where radio pulsars , rrats and xdinss ( and possibly also magnetars ) are different evolutionary stages of the same object .",
    "another possible , more exotic solution would be the existence of some , as yet unknown , mechanism for forming nss . while the determined birthrates are uncertain for xdinss , rrats and magnetars we consider the currently claimed uncertainties , if in fact they are correct , not to be large enough to convincingly remove the described problem .    to truly advance in answering these questions , it is essential to find a significantly larger number of sources to increase the known populations of rrats , xdinss and magnetars .",
    "searches to this end are underway and many more are planned .",
    "there are prospects for discovering xdinss and magnetars from future high energy observatories .",
    "these include the international x - ray observatory ( which has now superceded the planned xeus and con - x missions ) as well as the recently launched fermi gamma - ray space observatory .",
    "radio surveys include the ongoing p - alfa survey at arecibo ( cordes et al .",
    "2006 ) , the planned transients and pulsar observations with lofar , and the new parkes and effelsberg multi - beam all - sky surveys ( beginning autumn 2008 ) .",
    "ultimately , a galactic census of pulsars with the square kilometre array ( ska ) should improve our knowledge of galactic neutron stars phenomenally with the expected detection of @xmath142 new pulsars @xcite .",
    "together , the ska and lofar will monitor the northern and southern hemisphere essentially continuously . even though the spectrum of rrats and hence their discovery potential at low frequencies still has to be assessed",
    ", both telescopes should allow us to potentially observe most rrats in the galaxy that are beaming towards earth .",
    "in other words , ska observations will , with certainty , establish the relative population numbers for rrats and pulsars , confirming or rejecting the results of this study .",
    "extremely valuable information will , however , be already available much sooner with the help of lofar ( van leeuwen & stappers 2008 )  .",
