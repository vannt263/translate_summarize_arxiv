    "the physics of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) is characterized by the presence of several competing orders . besides antiferromagnetism and superconductivity ,",
    "it is now widely accepted that the underdoped region of the htsc phase diagram shows a pseudogap phase  @xcite and occasionally the presence of spatially - ordered states  @xcite at special dopings , characterized by charge domain walls separated by antiferromagnetic regions .",
    "recently , accurate stm experiments  @xcite have revealed modulations of the local density of states in the form of unidirectional domains for two different underdoped htsc materials , ca@xmath1na@xmath2cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 and bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 , where spatial ordering was not detected before .",
    "these findings highlight the importance of inhomogeneous states as a general feature of htsc , and extend the idea of quasi - one dimensional order beyond the original spin - stripe picture  @xcite , with superconductivity coexisting with charge modulation , in the absence of antiferromagnetism .",
    "moreover , recent measurements of hall resistance  @xcite on underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath5o@xmath2 and yba@xmath3cu@xmath6o@xmath7 give evidence of a reconstruction of the fermi surface caused by the onset of a density - wave phase in the large - field induced normal state , indicating that spatial symmetry breaking is a common characteristic of underdoped cuprates .",
    "theoretically , it is challenging to characterize a modulated state that could mimic the experimental findings , and to identify the key microscopic parameters that could induce this kind of non - uniform superconducting phases . indeed , besides the strong , local repulsion among electrons , that leads to antiferromagnetism , the low - energy physics of cuprates is often determined by additional hopping integrals among next - nearest neighbor copper atoms , and by a long - range coulomb repulsion among electrons .",
    "these terms have been studied in the past for different inhomogeneous states and were found to stabilize modulated superstructures  @xcite . also of relevance , is the role played by structural instabilities , a feature undoubtedly present in many htsc compounds , in stabilizing modulated superstructures .",
    "indeed , htsc are often characterized by a low - temperature tetragonal phase  @xcite , produced by a tilt of the oxygen octahedra that leads to a different electronic hopping and exchange integral along the two planar directions .",
    "previous calculations found that spatial anisotropy could stabilize antiferromagnetic - stripe phases  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in view of what is found in experiments , it is important to understand if a similar effect occurs for _ superconducting _ modulated states .    in this paper , we study the competition among homogeneous and non - uniform superconducting states , by taking into account the presence of spatial lattice distortions , next - nearest neighbors hopping terms and long - range coulomb repulsion . as a prototype model for cuprate superconductors",
    ", we investigate the @xmath0 model  @xcite in two dimensions , by using state - of - the - art variational monte carlo techniques ( supplemented by mean - field approaches ) .",
    "following anderson idea  @xcite , the variational approach , based on the resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) wavefunction , has successfully described most of the features of htsc  @xcite . however , to tackle spatially - inhomogeneous superconducting states like those found by experiments , more involved calculations , including the possibility of local modulations in the superconducting state , are required . here",
    ", we accomplish this task and show that , generically , half - filled hole stripes can form easily in a rvb superconductor at quite small energy cost . interestingly enough , lattice distortion and long - range coulomb repulsion are proved to play a key role .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmodel ]",
    "we introduce the model and the variational approach , presenting the two families of modulated wavefunctions that we study , the @xmath8-phase shift and inphase domain rvb wavefunctions . in section  [ sectj ]",
    "we characterize in detail the new inphase domain rvb state , introduced in this paper , for the @xmath0 model . in section  [ sectetragonal ] ,  [ sectp ] and  [ secv ]",
    "we show the effect of lattice distortion , next - nearest neighbor hopping and long - range coulomb repulsion , respectively , on the stabilization of modulated superconducting states .",
    "finally , in section  [ secsummary ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian is defined , using standard notations , as  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 acts on the reduced hilbert space with no double occupancies . for non - distorted lattices",
    "we take @xmath11 for all nearest neighbors . instead",
    ", tetragonal distortion is set by taking different hopping and exchange parameters along the @xmath12 and @xmath13 direction , according to the position of the tilt axis .",
    "this implies @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) respectively for the tilt axis along the @xmath13 ( @xmath12 ) direction . here",
    ", we mainly focus on the physically relevant case @xmath19 ( if not specified otherwise ) at doping @xmath20 .    in the following , we make use of the variational monte carlo techniques ( vmc ) , using clusters of @xmath21 , 128 ( 45 degree @xmath22 tilted lattice ) and @xmath23 sites with periodic - boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , to have access to larger sizes that can approach the thermodynamic limit , we compare our variational results with predictions coming from the renormalized mean - field theory ( rmft )  @xcite , on a @xmath24 cluster , using unit cell translation symmetry  @xcite ( for more details on the rmft results , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the variational procedure ,",
    "the rvb state is derived from the bcs mean - field state by incorporating the effect of correlation via the so - called gutzwiller projector @xmath25 , that can be treated exactly within the quantum monte carlo scheme .",
    "indeed , given the mean - field hamiltonian : @xmath26 we construct the variational state by applying the gutzwiller projector to the ground state @xmath27 of eq .",
    "( [ eqhmf ] ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 counts the number of electrons of spin @xmath30 on site @xmath31 .",
    "the terms @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eqhmf ] ) correspond to a set of parameters that are optimized in order to minimize the variational energy , according to the stochastic minimization algorithm  @xcite . in the simple case of the uniform rvb state , the independent parameters reduce to @xmath35 and @xmath36 for nearest neighbors , with the sign following the @xmath37-wave symmetry .",
    "moreover , another competing homogeneous state , the staggered - flux phase  @xcite ( sfp ) , is obtained by allowing the hopping parameters @xmath32 to be complex , leading to staggered currents circulating in opposite directions in the neighboring plaquettes .    here",
    ", we study possible instabilities of the rvb state towards spatial modulations , allowing the rvb bonds @xmath33 to become inhomogeneous .",
    "in particular , it is known from experiments that one - dimensional hole - rich regions are generally spaced by @xmath38 , implying half - filled hole domains with an average of one hole every @xmath39 sites in the direction where translational symmetry is broken . at a doping of @xmath20 , this corresponds to a periodicity of four lattice spacings @xmath40 .",
    "remarkably , we found such states , where hole - rich stripes coexist with modulated superconducting domains , whose energy per site is only of a very small fraction of @xmath41 higher than its uniform counterpart .",
    "the hierarchy of phases is therefore expected to be very sensitive to the details of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "( color online ) cartoon of the ( a ) bond - centered and ( b ) site - centered domain rvb ( drvb ) stripes .",
    "non - equivalent bonds have different colors .",
    "thicker ( larger ) bonds ( circles ) have larger pairing ( hole ) densities .",
    "dashed lines indicate bonds where @xmath42 is set to zero . ]    in a previous paper  @xcite , we considered a variational domain - rvb state that contains a @xmath8-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter between regions of four - lattice spacings width ( @xmath8drvb ) .",
    "the phase shifts create domain walls with vanishing pairing amplitude and a consequent concentration of holes .",
    "the @xmath8drvb states turned out to be competitive with respect to the homogeneous rvb state , and could explain the copper - oxygen layer decoupling found in la@xmath43ba@xmath44cuo@xmath6 , accompanied by a depression of @xmath45 at 1/8 doping  @xcite . here , we complete the characterization of @xmath8drvb states , by considering the effect of lattice distortion , nearest - neighbor hopping term , and long - range coulomb repulsion . moreover , since the presence of the antiphase domains implies a certain amount of energy , in the following we investigate an alternative strategy to tackle the problem , and propose another possible candidate for superconducting stripes , where domains are inphase : the domain rvb state ( drvb ) .",
    "starting from the rvb state , we investigate the energy cost associated to the introduction of line defects in the uniform state , in the form of unidirectional hole domains .",
    "this is done by imposing a vanishing pairing amplitude @xmath46 along one direction , with a periodicity that , at doping 1/8 , corresponds to 4@xmath47 . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the two possible modulations of the inphase drvb state derived from the above arguments . in figure",
    "[ fig1](a ) stripes are bond - centered ( bc ) , with the rvb bonds characterized by a periodicity of @xmath40 along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the pairing field @xmath33 associated to one type of horizontal bonds is set to zero .",
    "alternatively , in figure  [ fig1](b ) the stripes are site - centered ( sc ) , where the lines of vertical bonds with @xmath46 are separated by @xmath40 along the @xmath12 direction .    besides the @xmath8-shift domain rvb stripes , which could give a natural explanation to the decoupling among superconducting - layers , this second class of superconducting hole stripes , the drvb states , could be related to the stm experimental findings of inhomogeneous superconducting states .",
    "in this section we characterize the new inphase domain rvb states for the @xmath0 model , showing that , among the superconducting stripe states  @xcite , they constitute a valid candidate for a strongly - competing , inhomogeneous state .",
    "we start by considering the variational energies of the different stripe states , together with the corresponding rmft values in table  [ tabenergy ] .",

    "however , in both cases the small energy difference indicates both drvb states as very promising candidates for a competing inhomogeneous state .",
    "remarkably , within the drvb geometry , the suppression of some of the rvb bonds does not imply significant energy costs .",
    "notice that , at the variational level , the optimal wavefunctions preserve the @xmath37-wave symmetry of the pairing field in the regions where @xmath49 , with a small modulation that depends upon the type of bond ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "it turns out that the hole distribution along the different sites of the unitary cell is non - uniform , the hole density being larger along the regions where @xmath46 ( notice that the magnitude of the hole modulation increases with @xmath51 ) .",
    "moreover , the magnetic and kinetic energies follow the same modulation than the charge . indeed , along the @xmath46 bonds the kinetic energy is enhanced , while the magnetic energy is suppressed , as expected .",
    "note that the bonds presenting the largest modulation are the horizontal ( vertical ) ones for the bc ( sc ) wavefunction , i.e. , the bonds along the direction where some of the pairing fields are suppressed .    finally , to characterize the superconducting properties of our variational states , we calculate the singlet pairing correlations : @xmath52 where @xmath53 creates a singlet pair of electrons among nearest neighbors for each independent site @xmath54 of the unitary cell in figure  [ fig1 ] and @xmath55 is the unit vector , that specifies the bond direction ( along @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) .",
    "we extract the pairing order parameter by taking the square root @xmath56 of the pairing correlation function ( [ eqpairing ] ) at the maximum distance @xmath57 for different cluster sizes , for all independent sites .",
    "notice that the vmc and rmft profiles are in agreement .",
    "however , within vmc , we find , for all different bonds , that the pairing order parameter is finite , see figure  [ pair+parambc ] .",
    "remarkably , this is the case also for the bond where the variational parameter @xmath46 , signaling that the gutzwiller approximation is not accurate in this case .",
    "the resulting picture consists of two different types of bonds , some associated to the hole - rich region , and others where the superconducting order parameter , although slightly enhanced or depressed locally , is very close the one found for the homogeneous rvb state .",

    "the stability of the two possible stripe arrangements is evident in the inset of figure  [ energy - j - tx ] , where @xmath64 , i.e. , the energy of the stripe parallel to the tilt axis minus the energy of the stripe perpendicular to it , shows a different behavior for bc and sc stripes .",

    "it turns out that , by increasing @xmath89 , the long - range correlation term plays a fundamental role in lowering the energy of the rvb variational state .",

    "indeed , considering relative stability of the sfp with respect to the rvb state ( see inset of figure  [ fig6 ] ) , it turns out that , with a short - range jastrow , the sfp is the lowest - energy state already for @xmath90 , while the addition of a long - range jastrow stabilizes the rvb state up to very large values of the coulomb repulsion .",

    "in particular , notice that the part at long distances is non - negligible even for @xmath92 .",
    "since a uniform jastrow can promote the stability of uniform states and mask possible instabilities towards modulated states , we optimize the jastrow parameters up to the next - nearest neighbor distance independently on the nonequivalent bonds ( i.e. here the @xmath93 depend on @xmath31 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "the resulting energies are shown in figure  [ fig8 ] where , even though the stripe energies approach the uniform rvb wavefunction by increasing @xmath89 , the homogeneous state still remains the most stable .",

    "moreover , considering the inphase drvb state , it turns out that for finite @xmath89 the energy difference with respect to the rvb state is very small , of the order of the error bars .",
    "unfortunately , in the presence of a non - local coulomb repulsion , the main limit of this approach corresponds to the necessity of incorporating long - range jastrow terms in order to reach a good accuracy .",
    "since the energies into play are very small , the restriction of homogeneous jastrow terms at large distances , which governs the low - energy physics , could ultimately favor the uniform rvb state and bias our variational outcome .",
    "in other words , it might not be sufficient to assume inhomogeneous jastrow terms at short distances .",
    "however , these variational results suggest already that long - range coulomb repulsion can be a driving force for the stabilization of modulated states .",
    "in summary , we have shown that unidirectionally modulated superconducting states are remarkably close in energy to the uniform rvb state .",
    "this is the case both for @xmath8-phase shift domain rvb stripes and for inphase domain rvb stripes .",
    "their properties reflect the recent stm observations , both concerning the modulated charge and superconducting features .",
    "besides the lattice distortion , long - ranged coulomb repulsion further stabilizes the non - uniform superconducting stripe phases . instead , next - nearest neighbor hopping does not seem to play any role in the hierarchy of phases studied here .",
    "however , although the stripe energies can approach very closely that of the homogeneous rvb state , so far the uniform solution remains the most stable .",
    "in particular , we have found that a @xmath8-phase shift costs more energy than the inphase counterpart having simple @xmath96 domains .",
    "experiments suggest that the real stabilization of hole - stripes might imply some further factors than those investigated here .    besides the perturbations to the @xmath0 hamiltonian considered in this paper",

    "indeed , considering that decreasing @xmath41 along one direction leads to smaller @xmath33 for the bonds in that direction , whereas decreasing @xmath48 produces the opposite , we deduce that the kinetic contribution dominates this competition ( the same effect occurs also in the rvb state with rotational symmetry breaking ) . in presence of lattice distortion ,",

    "<S> indications of density - wave states in underdoped cuprates , coming from recent stm ( scanning tunneling microscopy ) and hall - resistance measurements , have raised new concerns whether stripes could be stabilized in the superconducting phase of cuprate materials , even in the absence of antiferromagnetism . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate this issue using state - of - the - art quantum monte carlo calculations of a @xmath0 model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we consider the stability of unidirectional hole domains in a modulated superconducting background , by taking into account the effect of tetragonal - lattice distortions , next - nearest neighbor hopping and long - range coulomb repulsion . </S>"
