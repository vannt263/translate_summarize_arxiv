    "2 with ngc2782 is unclear .",
    "it could be a foreground or background object .",
    "the x - ray light curves of both sources do not show any significant evidence for variability .",
    "in addition to the hri observation , ngc2782 appears on an archived pspc frame ( observation number : wg701555p ) , taken on nov .  8 , 1993 .",
    "during this 7 ksec exposure ngc2782 was far off - axis in the field of view . due to the reduced spatial resolution of the telescope away from the axis , sources no .",
    "1 and 2 could not be separated . however , since no .",
    "1 dominates the integrated x - ray flux crude information about its spectral shape can be retrieved from the pspc frame .    to this end",
    "we extracted the source photons within a radius of 300 , corrected the data for telescope vignetting and detector dead - time , and binned the pspc spectrum according to a constant signal - to - noise .",
    "for the background correction of the source spectrum we selected the counts of a source free region near ngc2782 .",
    "we then fitted the background subtracted pspc spectrum with a single powerlaw taking into account the galactic interstellar absorption towards ngc2782 of @xmath26 @xmath15 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the best fit yields a photon index @xmath27 and an x - ray luminosity ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) of log(@xmath28)=41.6@xmath290.6 .",
    "this does not mean that the spectrum actually _ is _ a powerlaw , but a spectral shape has to be assumed to obtain a flux .",
    "ngc6240 was observed twice with the pspc , on sept . 24 , 1992 and feb .",
    "1314 , 1993 .",
    "the source was located at the center of the field of view .",
    "the total exposure time is about 8 ksec .    for the data analysis ,",
    "source photons were extracted within a circle of radius 150 . after removing all detected sources within the inner field of view the background was determined and subtracted .",
    "the data were corrected for vignetting and dead - time following standard prescriptions of the exsas software ( zimmermann et al .",
    "the source - countrate is about 0.06 cts s@xmath4 . for the spectral analysis source photons in the amplitude channels",
    "11 - 240 were binned so that a constant signal / noise ratio of @xmath30 was secured .",
    "for the temporal analysis we chose time bins of 400 s which are the smallest ones to smear out the variations caused by the satellite s wobble motion .",
    "the x - ray isophotes for the 1992 exposure overlayed on the digitized poss are shown in fig .",
    "the k5 star hd152140 is the strongest x - ray source in both observations ( mean countrate @xmath31 cts s@xmath4 ) .",
    "all other sources in the field are significantly weaker than ngc6240 .",
    "the k star was used to positionally align both frames .",
    "approximating the source photon distribution by a gaussian and representing the extent by the fwhm of this distribution , we find a value of 37 .",
    "this exceeds the width of the pspc point spread functions for different channels .",
    "e.g. , for a point source we determined fwhms of 23   and 27   at channel 110 and 60 , respectively .",
    "a notable extension beyond the psf is present in all energy intervalls ( soft as well as hard ) . to be sure",
    ", we additionally verified that the extent is not due to the electronic ghost imaging that widens the point spread function below 0.2 kev ( nousek & lesser 1993 ) .",
    "consequently , the x - ray image obtained with the pspc is extended in both observations .",
    "the x - ray positions of both , ngc6240 and the k star , agree with their optical positions ( as given in simbad ) within less than one arcsec for the 1993 observation . in the 1992 data , _ both _ x - ray positions are shifted by @xmath24 10   relative to their optical positions .",
    "this shift can be traced back to the known boresight error of the telescope ( briel et al .",
    "1994 ) and has been corrected for in the overlay of the x - ray contours on the optical image ( fig .",
    "figure 2 shows the individual countrates versus time for the 1992 and 1993 observations . given the statistical errors no significant variations can be claimed . in the all - sky survey , ngc6240 was detected with a countrate of @xmath32 ( voges et al .",
    "1997 ) which is consistent with the individual pointed observations .",
    "as shown in fig .  3 there is no evidence for spectral changes between the 1992 and 1993 observations so that the data were merged to ensure better statistics .",
    "however , the @xmath33 photons detected in total limit any meaningful fits by spectral models to no more than two spectral components .",
    "even with this restriction , the measured total soft x - ray luminosity is highly model dependent as is illustrated by the numerous statistically acceptable fits in table 2 .",
    "this is due to the large bin widths which causes individual fitted photon numbers in each bin to depend on the spectral shape .",
    "in addition to the individual model determining parameters like temperature @xmath34 ( one parameter of the `` thermal '' models as bb = black body , thb = thermal bremsstrahlung , rs = thin thermal plasma in collisional equilibrium as computed by raymond & smith ( 1977 ) ) or powerlaw index @xmath35 ( for `` nonthermal '' pl = powerlaw models according to a photon flux distribution @xmath36 with @xmath37 = photon energy ) and the necessary normalization constants , the fits depend on the column density @xmath38 of `` cold '' gas that is represented by the summed photoelectric cross sections for gas with cosmic chemical abundances .",
    "table 2 shows that individually fitted @xmath38 values can grossly vary among the fitted models because @xmath38 influences the slope of the soft component .",
    "we adopt the galactic hydrogen column @xmath39 @xmath15 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) in the direction of ngc6240 as a lower limit .",
    "however , a spectral emission model fitted with this column would have to encounter no absorption _ within _ ngc6240 which appears somehow unlikely in view of the abundant molecular and ionized material observed in the central region of this object .",
    "the emission would have to arise in an `` outer shell '' or penetrate through optically thin windows in the ism .",
    "indeed , a pl - model with @xmath40 ( model e in table 2 ) leads to a bad fit while a bb - model ( model a ) fits well .",
    "however , such a huge bb - shell , optically thick in soft x - rays and extending over more than 30  or , in linear scales , over more than 21 kpc can not be reasonably imagined in physical terms .",
    "the physically expected thin x - ray emitting gas will emit lines with a significant contribution so that the thb fit ( model b ) is excluded as well . our main goal to showing these ( from the beginning ) unrealistic models",
    "is to find out the range of luminosities ( last column in table 2 ) obtained by different spectral shapes .",
    "a powerlaw with free column ( model d ) is statistically feasible but has a steep slope with @xmath41 .",
    "only the subgroup of so - called narrow - line seyfert-1 galaxies ( nlsy1 ; e.g. puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ; boller et al .  1996",
    "; greiner et al .  1996 ) is known to have comparatively steep slopes .",
    "komossa & greiner ( 1995 ) proposed to explain these objects by warm absorption of an intrinsically flat ( @xmath42 ) powerlaw .",
    "the steep spectrum is then mimicked by the presence of matter - bounded , completely h - ionized absorbing gas ( so - called `` warm absorbers '' ) , which absorb by metal ions . applying a standard warm - absorber model ( as e.g.  described in komossa & fink 1997 )",
    "we found no acceptable fit .",
    "hence , the steep slope , far off the canonical value @xmath18 , has to be intrinsic which , if persisting in the uv , would cause an ultraluminous uv component never seen in any unobscured object . finally , the luminosity of model d ( last column in table 2 ) of @xmath43 erg s@xmath4 is so huge that , for common agn @xmath44 ratios , a hidden qso of @xmath45 erg s@xmath4 would be required that would heat the central dust in ngc6240 to more than three times the observed fir luminosity unless the bulk of its radiation escapes elsewhere .",
    "we consider model d as unlikely .",
    "we are left with model c as a purely thermal solution and f as a hybrid model consisting of thin thermal gas plus a nonthermal component .",
    "the added pl in f leads to a comfortably small luminosity compared to c because its assumed ` flat ' slope helped to minimize @xmath38 .",
    "tuning the pl index to flatter slopes does not lead to a significant further luminosity reduction ( cf .",
    "model e ) .",

    "a notable contribution by direct emission from ob stars present in the supposed starburst is ruled out : each star only emits @xmath77 erg s@xmath4 of a rather soft x - ray energy distribution ( e.g. vaiana et al .  1981 , berghfer et al .",

    "a large number of massive x - ray binaries and a few supernova remnants with luminosities in the range 10@xmath79 erg s@xmath4 do collectively play a significant role in ` normal ' spiral galaxies .",
    "ngc6240 might be the product of the collision of such objects which in their normal state have a x - ray luminosity of @xmath80 erg s@xmath4 ( fabbiano 1989 ) . since there is no known mechanism to boost the number of x - ray binaries by two orders of magnitudes in the interaction process it appears practically ruled out that the @xmath81 erg s@xmath4 soft x - rays come from binaries .",
    "supernova remnant activity can indeed be boosted in a starburst triggered by the interaction , but this leads us directly to the superwind model .",
    "sophisticated two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of galactic superwinds are available ( e.g.  suchkov et al .",
    "however , such studies mainly address the `` prototype '' m82 so that their particular examples hardly reach the temperatures and luminosities found in our fits .",
    "lacking precise constraints our goal is limited to the estimate whether the huge thermal rs - component luminosities from the fits are feasible .",
    "hence , we use a scalable theory rather than a hydrodynamical model with specific initial conditions . we utilize the most sophisticated models of this type which were built by mac low & mccray ( 1988 ; for an application see also schulz 1990 ) who had extended the seminal work by weaver et al .",

    "1990 ) that yield @xmath83 kpc including a correction for a disk inclined by up to 40   from edge - on . the strong dust lane on b photographs ( best visible in the masked prints made by fosbury & wall 1979 ) suggests a close - to - edge - on view of the main disk .",
    "the large line widths ( fwhm ) cited in sect .  1 which most frequently lie in the range between 480 and 620 km s@xmath4 , but occasionally reach 900 km s@xmath4  ( keel 1990 ) , are due to the summed effect of outflow , rotation and ` turbulence ' ( the filamentary shell in m82 shows linewidths of up to 300 km s@xmath4 ; cf .",
    "bland & tully 1988 ) . as pointed out by van der werf et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , shock velocities exceeding 200 km s@xmath4 would boost the [ oi ] and [ sii ] emission - line intensities relative to h@xmath82 and lower [ oiii]/[oi ] thereby deteriorating the explanation of the optical spectra by a large contribution of shockheated gas .",

    "a factor - of-3 increase of @xmath106 would fit to our upper limit of @xmath90 that is in accordance with shocked h@xmath82 ( see above ) but already strain the conditions for @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( eqs .  1 and 2 ) .",

    "however , a @xmath110 yr old bubble would have already commenced other starbursts for which no trace is visible and , more seriously , our theory would no more be applicable .",
    "this exercise of boosting the parameters to high but not excludable values demonstrates the basic difficulty of getting a soft - x ray luminosity of several @xmath111 erg s@xmath4 from a single superbubble .",
    "some concern about the single - rs fit ( model c in table 2 ) also arises by the high cold absorbing column , which corresponds to @xmath112 mag ( using bohlin s et al.(1978 ) relation ) .",
    "thronson et al . (",
    "1990 ) find @xmath113 in the double nuclei but elsewhere @xmath114 .",
    "the latter value should be more typical for most of the volume occupied by the extended supershell .",
    "inverse - compton ( ic ) upscattered photons from the fir photons in the radio sources of ngc6240 would generate a flux of @xmath115 erg s@xmath4 @xmath15 ( colbert et al .",
    "the powerlaw component of model f ( table 2 ) emits a flux of @xmath116 erg s@xmath4 and is therefore likely to be attributed to an agn - like source .",
    "it may , however , appear striking that the expected ic scattered flux fits our measured powerlaw if the compton x - ray emission disk - halo model devised by goldshmidt & rephaeli ( 1995 , gr95 ) is upscaled from the starburst galaxy ngc253 to ngc6240 via the fir ratio .",
    "the gr95 model predicts an unattenuated compton flux of @xmath117 erg @xmath15 s@xmath4 in the band if ngc253 were placed at 144 mpc , the distance of ngc6240 adopted here . scaling this by the ratio 175 of the fir luminosities ( the flux formula from helou et al .",
    "( 1985 ) yields @xmath118 for ngc6240 , gr95 use @xmath119 for ngc253 ) leads to @xmath120 erg @xmath15 s@xmath4 which is , indeed , nearly the same as the power - law flux of ngc6240 given in the last paragraph .    however , this simple scaling may be misleading because the magnetic fields in the radio sources of ngc6240 are higher than in ngc253 ( colbert et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the flux - dominating two",
    "radio nuclei the _ lower limit _ of the magnetic field is fifty times ( @xmath121 g ) larger than that in the central synchrotron source of ngc253 ( @xmath122 g ) while in the western extended regions @xmath123 g which is 2.2 times larger .",
    "granted that other conditions are scalable , the boost in the magnetic energy densities ( @xmath124 ) should diminish the above ngc253-scaled ic flux estimate ( roughly @xmath125 ) by factors between @xmath126 ( compact components ) and @xmath127 ( extended regions ) .",
    "hence , within this scheme it appears that at least the extended radio sources may contribute a significant comptonized power law .",
    "adopting this scaled gr95 model for ngc6240 would , however , mean to scale the radiation energy density distribution from ngc253 by luminosity which requires an identical size of the fir emitting region in objects that differ in luminosity by a factor of hundred .",
    "even if this might be the case the electron distribution in the extended halo components of ngc253 and ngc6240 would have to be similar as well , which is doubtful because of the hundred times smaller propagation lengths for the disk - halo connection via electron convection and diffusion in the latter galaxy .",
    "this is due to the increased radiative loss in the central disk ( see , e.g. , eq .  8 and the subsequent discussion in gr95 ) .    in their more direct approach , colbert et al .",
    "related the compton upscattering to the _ observed _ synchrotron sources and tested two complementary types of fir distributions ( distributed like the radio sources and uniform distribution ) .",
    "neither case , regardless of compact or extended sources , yielded any flux above a few percent of that of our pl component .    finding no direct clue from available observations that ic upscattering of fir photons plays a significant role",
    "we continue to interpret the powerlaw by an agn - like source .",
    "notwithstanding , gr95-type ic models for extended components might become relevant if some of the presently only crudely known parameters will attain more favorable values for such processes in the future .    the supershell model in sect .",
    "6.1.1 easily accounts for the rs - component of model f which makes 20% of the total flux .",
    "we now have to explain the remaining @xmath7 erg s@xmath4 in the powerlaw . aside from the x - rays ,",
    "the only other hint for high - energy radiation of an agn is given by the high - excitation core in the southern nucleus ( rafanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) that accounts for @xmath128% of h@xmath129 .",
    "this component is probably due to a ` window ' in the ism and does not allow a direct view of the continuum source .",
    "consequently , the supposed agn is likely to be seen in scattered light .",
    "this is in agreement with our non - detection of variability of the supposed agn because scattering the x - rays over several kpc would smear out any short - term variability .",
    "the electrons in the extended ionized regions of the superwind and supershell itself are one possible source of scatterers .",
    "a simple geometry with only one constant - density population of electrons defines a fraction @xmath130 of the agn luminosity @xmath8 to be seen as scattered luminosity @xmath131 by the condition @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the thomson cross - section @xmath134 @xmath53 , @xmath135 our measured powerlaw luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath4 . from the central biconical h@xmath82 structure one",
    "estimates that a fraction @xmath136 can escape from the central @xmath8 ( for simplicity assumed to be isotropic in the first instance ) , corresponding to an ideal bicone with opening angle @xmath137 for each side . in practice",
    ", the structure has a broader base and has a shape something in between a biconical and a bycilindrical configuration , but for a crude estimate this distinction is unimportant",
    ".    basically two types of scatterers are available : firstly , the dense material close to the baseline and in the broken shells . for isothermal shocks we would expect densities of the order of @xmath138 @xmath88 . for the bright filamentary material within the innermost 2 kpc",
    "an electron density of 500 @xmath88 was measured by heckman et al .",
    "secondly , low - density , distributed in the bicone , could reach significant electron - scattering depths due to its spatial extent of up to 10 kpc .",
    "the h@xmath82 image from keel ( 1990 ) shows a strong surface - brightness enhancement in the southern nucleus suggesting that luminous high - density material is concentrated there .",
    "adopting from the above @xmath139 @xmath88 and @xmath140 pc leads to @xmath141 or a predicted ( isotropic ) @xmath142 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the mass of this ionized gas in the inner bicone would be @xmath143 , compatible with @xmath144 estimated from hydrogen - line luminosities ( depoy et al .",
    "1986 ; veilleux et al .  1995",
    "; the lower limit applies for pure recombination ) .",
    "the amount of dense ionized gas is only minute compared to the @xmath145 of available cold molecular gas in the center of ngc6240 ( solomon et al .",
    "its filling factor is likely to be @xmath146 , but the covering fraction must be large to ensure an _ effective _ scattering length of 200 pc . in this scenario the power - law component should be unresolved with current x - ray telescopes .",
    "the second possibility  an extended low - density region  would be much less efficient in scattering and involve a huge mass with unclear origin .",
    "e.g. @xmath147 kpc , @xmath148 @xmath88 would lead to @xmath149 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath150 ; in case of @xmath151 kpc , @xmath152 @xmath88 , we would need @xmath153 , but @xmath154 erg s@xmath4 that would exceed @xmath155 of ngc6240 !    we conclude that scattering is feasible but , even in a simple high - density scenario , it requires a rather luminous agn in the range @xmath156 erg s@xmath4 , which corresponds to @xmath157 erg s@xmath4 for a typical agn continuum , which is an appreciable fraction or nearly all of the fir luminosity ( @xmath158 erg s@xmath4 ) of ngc6240 .",
    "the luminosity demand for the agn is lowered in case of anisotropy of the agn radiation because in the unified scenario more luminosity is expected along the bicone than in the equatorial plane of the molecular torus .",
    "an alternative possibility would be a component like a ` warm scatterer ' , i.e.  near - central high density gas that scatters the x - rays into an escape window of the ism but shows itself relatively little intrinsic emission , is possible .",
    "the need for an agn in ngc6240 is also supported by preliminarily reported data ( mitsuda 1995 ) that show a power law in the 210 kev range plus a strong emission - line complex around fek@xmath82 .      in sect .",
    "2.1 we obtained @xmath159 erg s@xmath4 ( within a factor of 4 ) .",
    "this can be compared with @xmath8 expected from data by boer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who found optical evidence for an expanding supershell with @xmath160 kpc and d@xmath107/d@xmath161 km s@xmath4 leading to an age of @xmath162 yrs .",
    "they measured a total h@xmath129 luminosity of @xmath163 erg s@xmath4 yielding @xmath93(h@xmath82)@xmath164 erg s@xmath4 in case b. however , they estimate ( on p.  74 ) that the outflowing shell contributes 1% of the h - recombination lines , but caution on p. 75",
    "that this value might be ten times higher due to incomplete coverage . since the mechanical power should be hundred times that of h@xmath82 ( see sect .",
    "6.1.1 ) we obtain @xmath165 erg s@xmath4 or a sn rate of 0.026 to 0.26 yr@xmath4 .    plugging the lower sn rate into eqs .",
    "( 1 ) to ( 3 ) yields ( for @xmath166 ) @xmath167 kpc , @xmath168 km s@xmath4 and @xmath169 erg s@xmath4",
    ". while @xmath107 and @xmath170 are in good agreement with the measured data , @xmath8 is a factor 46 too small ! increasing the uncertain parameter @xmath171 by a factor 10 , would boost the luminosity by a factor of only 3 and lower size and velocity of the shell to 60% the values they should have .",
    "the latter effect can be canceled by taking the upper limit of @xmath90 by a factor of 10 , leading to @xmath172 erg s@xmath4 which is consistent with the measured @xmath8 .",
    "the sn rate is comparable to that of m82 and ngc253 ( rieke et al .",
    "1980 ; kronberg et al .",
    "1985 ) , starburst galaxies with an order of magnitude smaller @xmath8 from their centers ( strickland et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the difference is explained by the hundred times smaller ambient density in these objects ( @xmath173 ) than here assumed for ngc2782 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "if this latter conjecture will one day turn out to be wrong then seyfert ( 1943 ) might have been correct in considering ngc2782 as a ` seyfert galaxy ' of which we now see some x - rays scattered in the outflow region",
    ". however , presently the evidence for an agn in ngc2782 does not appear compelling .",
    "we analyzed data of the ultraluminous ir galaxy ngc6240 and of the starburst galaxy ngc2782 . with our best fit of the soft - x ray spectrum of ngc6240 we found a luminosity ( 0.12.4 kev ) of @xmath5 erg s@xmath4 that , by at least an order of magnitude , exceeds that of its ultraluminous rival arp220 ( see heckman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : @xmath175 to @xmath176 erg s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the difference is partly due to a luminous power - law component not present in arp220 .",
    "we interpret this power - law component as scattered light from a hidden agn with a luminosity that , depending on the poorly known scattering geometry , provides a major fraction of the bolometric luminosity of ngc6240 .",
    "about 20% of the total @xmath8 in the band are due to thermal superwind - shocked shell material .",
    "lacking other components the scattered light of the hidden agn is easiest to see in x rays .",
    "the scattered optical continuum is hard to decompose from the strong stellar background that was analyzed by schmitt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and shier et al .",
    "veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) noticed ` featureless ' continuum components in optical spectra of most ulirgs .",
    "polarization vectors presented in radovich ( 1993 ) reveal a scattering geometry around the center but more detailed work in this regard could be rewarding .    in sect .",
    "6.1.1 we saw that the hydrogen recombination - line spectrum is too strong to be completely attributed to shock heating . as shown by schulz & fritsch ( 1994 ) ,",
    "attenuating the ionizing continuum of an agn by hidden ionized absorbing gaseous columns with , e.g. @xmath177 , leads automatically to a liner like spectrum as observed in ngc6240 .",
    "this thin absorber is nearly transparent to x - rays .",
    "hence , the emerging picture of the core of ngc6240 is that of a buried agn component , which unlike a seyfert with a fully developed high - excitation spectrum , sees in no direction a completely clear sky .",
    "ngc2782 has an order - of - magnitude smaller x - ray luminosity than ngc6240 and can , in excellent agreement with optical data , be consistently explained by superbubble activity if the ambient density is relatively high ( average of 1 @xmath88 in the inner 2 kpc of the halo ) .",
    "this does not completely exclude a hidden low - luminosity agn , but so far , there is no positive evidence for it .",
