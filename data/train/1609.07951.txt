    "the chemostat is a biotechnological process of continuous culture developed by @xcite and @xcite in which bacteria live in a growth container of constant volume in which liquid is continuously injected .    from a mathematical point of view , beyond classic models based on systems of ordinary differential equations",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) or integro - differential equations ( see for instance @xcite ) , several stochastic models were introduced in the literature .",
    "the first - one seems to be the one developed by @xcite and is a birth and death process for the biomass growth coupled with a differential equation for the substrate evolution .",
    "this one is the main object of interest in section [ sect : crump - young ] below .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite studied some extensions of this model . in particular ,",
    "@xcite propose some stochastic differential equations to model the demographic noise from the microscopic interactions .",
    "other stochastic models were introduced by @xcite .",
    "let us also mention @xcite or , for individual - based models , @xcite which model the evolutionary dynamics of the chemostat .",
    "we focus here on the individual - based model developed by @xcite and @xcite . in this mass - structured model ,",
    "the bacterial population is represented as a set of individuals growing in a perfectly mixed vessel of constant volume .",
    "this representation combines discrete mechanisms ( birth and death events ) as well as continuous mechanisms ( mass growth and substrate dynamics ) . @xcite",
    "set the exact monte carlo simulation algorithm of this model and its mathematical representation as a stochastic process .",
    "they prove the convergence of this process to the solution of an integro - differential equation when the population size tends to infinity . in the present work",
    ", we investigate the study of the fluctuation process ; namely the difference between the measure - valued stochastic process and its deterministic approximation .",
    "we first show that , conveniently normalized , this fluctuation process converges to some superprocess .",
    "one difficulty is that it is a signed measure and we have to find a suitable space in which it , as well as its limit , are to be immersed ( because the space of signed measures endowed with the weak convergence is not metrizable ) .",
    "inspired by @xcite and @xcite , we consider the fluctuation process as an element of some sobolev space ( see section [ sect : spaces ] for a description of this space ) .",
    "this type of spaces takes the advantage to be hilbertian and one can use martingale techniques on hilbert spaces to obtain the tightness ( and then the convergence of this process ) ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "the limit object that we obtain is then an infinite dimensional degenerate gaussian process .",
    "we illustrate the interest of this result applying it in finite dimension .",
    "more precisely , for particular parameters , the mass - structured model of @xcite can be reduced to the two - dimensional crump - young model . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the long time behavior of this model is complex and misunderstood ; only few properties are known about the behavior before extinction .",
    "the convergence developed by @xcite induces an approximation by an ordinary differential equation of the crump - young model , whereas our main result allows to obtain a stochastic differential approximation for which we are able to plainly describe the long - time behavior .",
    "our main results are described in section that follows : theorems [ th : tcl - intro ] and [ th : tcl - cy ] are the central limit theorems ( convergence of the fluctuation processes ) in infinite and finite dimensions .",

    "the main steps of the proof of theorem [ th : tcl - cy ] are given in section [ sec.proof.th:tcl-cy ] .",
    "the finite - dimensional case is studied in section [ sect : crump - young ] .",
    "we prove the convergence in time of the stochastic differential approximation of the crump - young model in section [ sect : proofcy ] .",
    "we present numerical simulations and discussion illustrating our results in section [ subsec.num.sim ] .",
    "in particular , we discuss about the validity of the approximation and introduce another diffusion process , obtained from theorem [ th : tcl - cy ] , whose the numerical behavior seems to have a better mimic of the crump - young model in some particular situations .",
    "the extinction time of this new process is studied in section [ subsec.extin.newsde ] .",
