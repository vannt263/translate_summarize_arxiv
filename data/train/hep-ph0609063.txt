    "after the invention of quantum mechanics , the need to make it consistent with special relativity led to creation of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory subsequently @xcite . in ( relativistic ) quantum field theory , due to the possibility of pair creation , a single particle can not be localized more closely than its compton wavelength without losing its identity as a single particle @xcite .",
    "the vexing problem of unifying the general relativity with quantum mechanics remains a holy grail of theoretical physics . from the very outset",
    "one sees that there is an important difference between the quantum mechanical space - time and the general relativistic one . in quantum mechanics",
    "the space - time is regarded as an essentially absolute , not affected by the processes taking place inside it . while in general relativity the space - time is given in terms of gravitational field that undergoes some evolution during the physical process and therefore becomes dynamical .",
    "frequently we speak of length and time intervals , i.e. , space and time , without asking critically how one actually measures them .",
    "it is clear that the coordinate system is defined only by explicitly carrying out the space - time distance measurements .",
    "wigner and subsequently salecker and wigner considered first this problem by applying simultaneously the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity @xcite . the analysis based on the _ gedankenexperiment _ for space - time measurement shows that the quantum fluctuations of geometry becomes of the same order as the geometry itself at the planck scale resulting therefore in the notion of minimal observable length beneath of which the geometrical properties of space - time may be lost @xcite",
    ". this would give space - time a foam - like structure at sub - planckian distances , for instance it may show up a fractal structure at this length scale while on larger scales it would look smooth and with a well - defined metric structure .",
    "planck length , @xmath2 , beneath of which the very concepts of space and time lose their meaning may play a role analogous to the speed of light in special relativity .",
    "if so , it means that planck length sets an observer independent minimum value of wavelength .",
    "a quantum uncertainty in the position of a particle implies an uncertainty in its momentum and due to gravity - energy interaction leads to uncertainty in the geometry introducing in its turn an additional position uncertainty for the particle .",
    "due to gravitational effects the minimum uncertainty in the position of a particle with energy @xmath3 takes the form @xmath4 showing therefore that the planck scale determines the lower bound for particle localization no matter what its compton wavelength , @xmath5 , is @xcite .",
    "( throughout this paper we set @xmath6 ) .",
    "by taking into account the gravitational effects one can also argue that it is impossible to accelerate a particle to post - planckian energies @xcite .",
    "the above conclusions concerning the planck scale effects rely on the simultaneous consideration of usual principles of quantum theory and general relativity . loosely speaking in the framework of general relativity the newtonian inverse square law",
    "is understood to be valid for length scales from infinity to roughly the planck scale . thus far",
    "the direct experimental tests for the short distance behavior of gravity are at sub - millimeter scale @xcite , while , loosely speaking , quantum theory ( electroweak interactions ) is probed at distances approaching @xmath7 cm .",
    "therefore it is important to notice that the fundamental role attributed to the planck length is based on the assumption that the gravity is unmodified over the @xmath8 orders of magnitude between where it is measured at @xmath9 cm down to the planck length @xmath10 cm . for the direct test of gravitational interaction at short distances",
    "is highly nontrivial problem , it is interesting therefore if indirect experimental measurements can shed some light on the question and guide us to get some understanding of the gravity behavior at relatively short distances . in what follows we discuss the uv modification of gravity in light of the discrepancy between the stellar interferometry observations and the theoretical predictions of planck scale space - time fluctuations demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "we think uv modification of gravity is most natural ( and perhaps most exciting ) possible outcome of the puzzle .",
    "let us consider a _ gedankenexperiment _ for distance measurement proposed in @xcite .",
    "our measuring device is composed of a spherical clock localized in the region @xmath11 and having a mass @xmath12 , which also serves as a light emitter and receiver , and a spherical mirror of radius @xmath13 and mass @xmath14 surrounding the clock , ( @xmath15 denotes the radius of the clock ) , fig.1 .",
    "we are measuring a distance @xmath16 by sending a light signal to the mirror under assumption that at the moment of light emission the centers of clock and mirror coincide .",
    "however , quantum uncertainties in the positions of the clock and mirror introduce an inaccuracy @xmath17 during the measurement .",
    "( throughout this paper we set @xmath6 ) .    assuming the minimal uncertainty the spread in velocity of the clock can be found as @xmath18 and analogously for the mirror as @xmath19 . after the time @xmath20 elapsed by light to travel along the closed path clock - mirror - clock the total uncertainty during the measurement takes the form @xmath21 which after minimization with respect to @xmath22 gives @xmath23 this uncertainty diminishes with increasing masses of the mirror and clock .",
    "but the masses are limited by the requirement the clock and the whole device as well not to collapse into the black hole . in other words",
    "the size of the clock(mirror ) should be greater than twice its gravitational radius .",
    "so by equating the size of the clock , @xmath22 , to its gravitational radius taken with factor @xmath24 , one gets the maximum allowed mass of the clock @xmath25 and then equating the size of the measuring device , @xmath16 , to its gravitational radius taken again with factor @xmath24 one finds the maximal allowed mass of the mirror @xmath26 in this way from eq.([minim ] ) one gets the minimum error in measuring a length @xmath16 to be @xmath27 from this equation it follows immediately that there exists the minimal observable length of the order of @xmath28 . from eq.([uncleng ] ) one readily gets the minimal uncertainty in time measurement , @xmath29 , by replacing @xmath2 and @xmath16 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "since the first term in eq.([uncleng ] ) is much greater than the second one for @xmath32 and they become comparable at @xmath33 , one can say with no loss of generality that for @xmath34 our precision of space - time measurement is limited by the measurement process itself such that @xmath35 loosely speaking , in eq.([uncleng ] ) one can consider the first and second terms as the uncertainties contributed to the measurement by the clock and mirror respectively .",
    "due to maximal symmetry of the measuring device considered here one can hope it provides minimal uncertainty in length measurement .",
    "+    the above discussion to be self - consistent let us notice that due to eq.([minlengunc ] ) the wavelength of photon used for a measurement may be known with the accuracy @xmath36 that results in additional uncertainty @xmath37~.\\]](for the sake of simplicity we assume that the wave length of the photon is not affected by the gravitational field of the clock ) .",
    "for @xmath38 can not be greater than @xmath16 in order to measure this distance the latter term in eq.([totalucerlam ] ) can be minimized by taking @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the latter term becomes comparable to the first one and therefore justifies the eq.([minlengunc ] ) .",
    "so , in general one can say that our precision in space - time distance measurement is inherently limited by the measurement process itself such that @xmath40 the quantum with momentum @xmath41 has the wavelength @xmath42 and from eq.([minlengunc ] ) for the energy - momentum uncertainties one gets    @xmath43",
    "an interesting idea proposed in @xcite is to consider the phase incoherence of light coming to us from extragalactic sources .",
    "since the phase coherence of light from an astronomical source incident upon a two - element interferometer is necessary condition to subsequently form interference fringes , such observations offer by far the most sensitive and uncontroversial test .",
    "the interference pattern when the source is viewed through a telescope will be destroyed if the phase incoherence , @xmath44 , approaches @xmath45 . in other words , if the light with wavelength @xmath38 received from a celestial optical source located at a distance @xmath16 away produces the normal interference pattern , the corresponding phase uncertainty should satisfy the condition @xmath46    the energy - momentum uncertainties , eq.([enmomun ] ) , result in uncertainties of phase and group velocities of the photon @xmath47 the light with wavelength @xmath38 traveling over a distance @xmath16 accumulates the phase uncertainty @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for maximal deviation of the ratio @xmath50 due to fluctuations @xmath51 taking a @xmath52 sign with equal probability . using the eqs.([enmomun],[phaseincoh ] ) one finds @xmath53    consider the examples used in @xcite .",
    "the young s type of interference effects were clearly seen at @xmath54 m light from a source at @xmath55 kpc distance , viz .",
    "the star s ser , using the infra - red optical telescope array , which enabled a radius determination of the star @xcite . using these values of wavelength and distance from eq.([intercond ] ) one gets @xmath56    airy rings ( circular diffraction ) were clearly visible at both the zeroth and first maxima in an observation of the active galaxy pks1413 + 135 ( @xmath57 gpc ) by the hubble space telescope at @xmath58 m wavelength @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , using the eq.([intercond ] ) one gets the phase incoherence @xmath59    this idea was further elaborated in @xcite by observing that the uncertainty in length measurement will lead to apparent blurring of distant point sources observed through the telescope confirming the above huge discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and the astronomical observations .",
    "from the preceding section one sees that the theoretical prediction for minimum lengths uncertainty in measuring the length of the order of @xmath60 m is about @xmath61 orders of magnitude greater in comparison with astronomical observations .",
    "the extent to which a rigorous physical meaning can be attributed to eq.([minlengunc ] ) must be founded on a direct appeal to experiments and measurements .",
    "the only ingredients used in derivation of minimum length uncertainty are position - momentum uncertainty relation and the standard expression of gravitational radius .",
    "therefore the contradiction between theoretical results and experiments can be understood as a failure of at least one of these ingredients . from section",
    "ii one sees that the size and the mass of the clock giving the minimal uncertainty in measuring a distance @xmath16 are given by @xmath62 by taking into account that @xmath15 is comparable to the gravitational radius of the clock evaluated on the bases of inverse square law and experimentally established lower limit to date for the newtonian inverse square law is @xmath63 cm , one can say for sure that the eq.([minlengunc ] ) describes physical reality for @xmath64 cm but can not be considered as rigorously established result beneath this length scale . in analyzing astronomical observations considered in @xcite",
    "we are evaluating the uncertainty for the photon wavelength being of the order of @xmath60 m by means of eq.([minlengunc ] ) assuming thereby the validity of newtonian inverse square law and the heisenberg position - momentum uncertainty relation at the lengths scale @xmath65 cm .",
    "simply speaking the position - momentum uncertainty relation is based on the de broglie relation plus simple properties common to all waves . if we want to measure the localization of some particle with accuracy @xmath22 we need to use the quantum ( photon for instance ) the wavelength of which @xmath66 .",
    "due to de broglie relation , such a quantum is characterized with momentum @xmath67 and during the scattering on the particle being observed imparts to it the momentum @xmath68 evaluated roughly as @xmath69 leading thereby to the position - momentum uncertainty relation @xmath70 the length scale @xmath71 is corresponding to the ultra - high energy cosmic rays , let us assume the position - momentum uncertainty relation is valid at least up to this scale .",
    "if position - momentum uncertainty relation is maintained , then as a weak spot in evaluation of minimum length uncertainty should be considered the use of newtonian inverse square law at the length scale @xmath71 cm .        which together with the eq.([modgravrad ] ) determines gravitational radius of the clock giving the minimal error in measurement of a given length @xmath16 as a function of @xmath16 @xmath75 knowing the maximal allowed mass of the clock one can determine the maximal allowed mass of the mirror as a function of @xmath16 through the equation @xmath76 and estimate the minimum length uncertainty by means of eq.([minim ] ) as      where @xmath78 is the solution of eq.([optclgravrad ] ) .",
    "let us omit the second term in eq.([lenguncmodgrav ] ) which decreases with @xmath16 and for the length scale @xmath79 m , which is the case in the above considered experiments , can be neglected in comparison with the first term .",
    "then for the phase and group velocity uncertainties of the photon one gets @xmath80 correspondingly the phase incoherence accumulated along a distance @xmath16 takes the form @xmath81    this equation combined with the second example of astronomical observation ( hst image of pks1413 + 135 ) puts the following limit @xmath82 from eq.([maxclmasmod ] ) one sees that the clock mass corresponding to this gravitational radius satisfy @xmath83 besides this restriction on @xmath84 , from eq.([phaseincmodg ] ) one sees that @xmath85 is also subject to the constraint due to experimental observations .    to illustrate the discussion let us consider the running newtonian constant of the form @xmath86 the direct experimental test for which in the case @xmath87 sets @xmath88 cm @xcite . correspondingly , the equation for the gravitational radius takes the form @xmath89 we notice that the yukawa type correction to the newtonian inverse square law with negative @xmath90 is inconsistent for our purposes . from the above discussion",
    "one finds that gravitational radius of the clock giving the minimal error in measuring of a given length @xmath16 is determined by the equation @xmath91 taking the upper bounds for the parameters @xmath92 , for parameter @xmath90 one finds @xmath93 so , in this case @xmath90 equals @xmath94 with a great accuracy . denoting",
    "@xmath95 one finds @xmath96 using the above parameters , from eq.([derofgravrad ] ) one gets @xmath97 therefore the running newtonian constant ( [ potential ] ) for @xmath98 satisfies the experimental constraints on eq.([phaseincmodg ] ) .            where @xmath102 .",
    "( an interesting feature of this running newton constant is that there is a critical value of mass , @xmath103 , below which the horizon disappears and leads therefore to the black hole remnants of about planck mass @xcite . ) from eq.([ograd ] ) one sees that this running newtonian constant gives practically the standard value of gravitational radius for @xmath104 kg and therefore does not satisfy the criterion for explaining the astronomical observations of the preceding section .",
    "the basic conceptual point coming from the _ gedankenexperiment _ for space - time measurement is that quantum fluctuations of measuring device in the process of making measurement does not allow the space - time intervals to be precisely determined . in other words",
    "the space - time is disturbed by the measurement process itself limiting thereby our precision in space - time measurement .",
    "therefore , one should take note of difficulty in evaluating of space - time disturbance during the real measurement stemming from the fact that in the real measurements we are not using optimal devices minimizing the space - time uncertainties caused by the measurement process itself .",
