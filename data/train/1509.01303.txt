    "the remaining 10% of the population is transferred to @xmath89 states .",
    "half of this population ( @xmath90 of the total ) contributes to qubit loss , bringing the total loss to 60 @xmath91 , while the other half ( also @xmath90 of the total ) is transferred to the excited state , which effectively causes dephasing of @xmath92 because the photon that is emitted in the process contains which - path information about the qubit state .",
    "the three decoherence types discussed in the previous sub - section have different effects on the cat state . loss and de - excitation",
    "completely destroy the cat state if they occur , while dephasing is both unlikely and relatively benign .",

    "the majority ( 60% ) of the dressed state s decay goes to non - qubit states @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 represents the emitted photon .",
    "in addition to loss , 35% of the dressed state",
    "s decay is de - excitation @xmath96 , where @xmath97 .",

    "the @xmath108 component corresponds to the ideal cat state .",

    "the fidelity of the resulting density matrix compared to an ideal cat state in the same subspace ( which corresponds to the case where de - excitation happens at @xmath122 ) can be written as @xmath123 . when the size of the cat state is increased from @xmath124 to @xmath125 ,",
    "the fidelity of the generated cat in the de - excited subspace is reduced from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "the fidelity in each of the @xmath0 subspaces where one atom was lost can be calculated in a similar way , yielding equivalent results .",
    "the total fidelity in the presence of rydberg decoherence is then @xmath128 .",
    "about 5% of rydberg decoherence will transfer back to the excited state , which acts as dephasing ( modeled by a lindblad operator @xmath129 ) .",
    "the dephasing operator commutes with the hamiltonian for cat state creation .",
    "its effect can therefore be studied by having it act on the final cat state .",
    "for example , it can cause a sign flip of @xmath2 for the first atom , resulting in a state @xmath130 . applying the @xmath54 rotation results in a new energy cat @xmath131 , which is clearly still a large superposition in energy .",
    "so the effect of dephasing errors is relatively benign .",
    "moreover , given the small relative rate of dephasing compared to loss and de - excitation , the probability of having a sign flip over the cat creation time for the case with decoherence fidelity of @xmath132 ( considered in fig .",

    "[ decoherence ] ) .",
    "in the context of modifications of quantum physics , decoherence in the energy basis is quite a natural possibility to consider @xcite .",
    "it is usually introduced as an additional term in the time evolution for the density matrix that is quadratic in the hamiltonian , @xmath205-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\hbar^2}[h,[h,\\rho]]$ ] , which leads to a decay of the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix in the energy basis according to @xmath206 @xcite , where @xmath207 . here",
    "@xmath208 is related to the energy difference of the two componants and @xmath209 can be interpreted as a timescale on which time is effectively discretized , e.g. related to quantum gravity effects .",
    "it is of interest to establish experimental bounds on the size of @xmath209 , which could in principle be as small as the planck time ( @xmath210 s ) .",
    "the corresponding decoherence rate for the energy cat in this proposal would be @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the energy difference between the ground and excited state of each qubit , and @xmath0 is the cat size . to detect the energy decoherence one prepares the energy cat state , followed by a waiting period . to observe the decoherence effect ,",
    "one detects the ramsey fringes for the revival .",
    "the visibility of the ramsey interference is also sensitive to other decoherence sources , where in the absence of dressing laser the dominant ones are the trap loss rate @xmath213 , which reduces the visibility by a factor @xmath214 , and phase diffusion that is explained below .",
    "the large energy difference of the cat state increases the sensitivity of the ramsey interferometry that we are using for the detection of energy decoherence .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider the effect of fluctuations in the detuning between the laser and the atomic transition .",
    "let us first note that the cat state is more sensitive to multi - particle ( correlated ) than to single - particle ( uncorrelated ) noise , which results in a phase diffusion affecting the visibility of ramsey fringes by @xmath215 and @xmath216 respectively @xcite . comparing the two cases , correlated fluctuations should be @xmath217 times more stabilized than uncorrelated fluctuations .",
    "the most important source of noise in our system is the fluctuation of the laser frequency .",
    "a probe laser linewidth as narrow as 26 mhz @xcite has been achieved in optical atomic clock experiments , and there are proposals for much smaller linewidths @xcite with recent experimental progress @xcite , justifying our example of a 10mhz linewidth , see below .    other sources of multi - particle and single - particle noise have been well studied in the context of strontium atomic clocks @xcite and are comparatively negligible . here",
    "we address a few of them in our scheme .",
    "one of the noise sources is the trap field s intensity fluctuation ; however , using the magic wavelength makes the atomic transition frequency independent of the trap laser intensity . considering the variation of the stark shifts due to the trap laser as a function of frequency at the magic wavelength @xcite",
    ", the relative scalar light shifts could be kept within 0.1mhz uncertainty by applying a trap laser with a 1mhz linewidth .",
    "in addition to the scalar light shift , the inhomogeneous polarization of trap fields in 3d optical lattices can result in an inhomogeneous tensor light shift @xcite ; however , the use of the bosonic isotope @xmath218sr with zero magnetic moment cancels the tensor light shift @xcite in our scheme .",
    "environmental temperature fluctuations ( @xmath219 ) also lead to atomic frequency fluctuations that are proportional to @xmath220 due to the bbr - induced light shift @xcite .",
    "this is another reason why a cryogenic environment is advantageous .",
    "for example controlling the environment temperature of @xmath221k @xcite to within a range of @xmath222 keeps the bbr - induced noise shift below @xmath223 mhz .",
    "a conservative estimate of the experimentally measurable energy decoherence rate can be obtained by considering the case where the energy decoherence dominates all other decoherence sources during the waiting period .",
    "increasing the cat size @xmath0 is helpful because it allows one to enhance the relative size of the energy decoherence contribution .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath224 keeps the loss and phase diffusion contributions fixed , while the energy decoherence still increases proportionally to @xmath0 . using a cat state with @xmath225 atoms ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which corresponds to @xmath226 300 ev , assuming a laser linewidth of @xmath227 mhz ( see above ) , and considering a trap loss rate of @xmath228 mhz @xcite , the minimum detectable discretization time scale @xmath209 is of order @xmath229 s. this would improve the measurement precision by 4 and 11 orders of magnitude compared to what is possible based on ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite respectively .",
    "here we explain the steps in calculating the effects of inhomogeneous interaction on the cat state s fidelity @xmath75 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : inhomogeneities ] ) .",
    "taylor expanding @xmath230 and considering the expectation values @xmath231 and @xmath232 , one obtains an estimate for the fidelity .",
    "the first order of the expansion is zero because we defined @xmath71 as fluctuations around a mean value .",
    "the second order can be calculated using @xmath233 , where @xmath234 if all the indices are unequal , @xmath235 if there is a pair of equal indices , and @xmath236 when there are two pairs of equal indices .",
    "the convergence of the expansion for the fidelity can be tested numerically . in fig .",
    "3b of the paper the ratio of the third order to the second order of the expansion for @xmath148 is @xmath237 for @xmath238 respectively , suggesting good convergence in this regime .",
    "in strontium one needs to consider both valence electrons @xmath239 in the calculation of the dipole matrix elements @xcite @xmath240 where @xmath241 and @xmath154 are the total orbital angular momentum and spin , @xmath242 and @xmath243 refer to individual electrons , and @xmath244 and @xmath245 refer to total angular momentum .",
    "the active electron in the transition is labeled by 2 , and @xmath246 is the radial dipole matrix element between initial and final state , and the curly bracket is a wigner-6j symbol .      100 c. monroe , d. m. meekhof , b. e. king , and d. j. wineland , science * 272 * , 1131 ( 1996 ) .",
