    "the packing of a long flexible rod of diameter @xmath0 into a finite quasi - two - dimensional domain of height @xmath1 yields a network of loops which is a pattern of folds that belongs to a new class of light - weight cellular materials with variable degrees of rigidity and with great potential for application in technology  @xcite .",
    "the general problem of a flexible rod confined in a two - dimensional cavity belongs to the context of elastic rods constrained to move on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the structures formed in these circumstances have a high surface / bulk ratio , and they extend the field of evolving non - equilibrium cellular systems composed of interacting domains separated by thin boundaries endowed with line energy  @xcite",
    ". new results on this subject may also be of interest in the study of shape memory materials using elastoplastic alloy wires  @xcite among others  @xcite .",
    "since the rod bends when inserted into the cavity and divides the available area into geometric domains , we can perform a direct comparison between the continuous packing and the discrete number of cells . in this context , the present study deals with the length @xmath2 required to build a given number @xmath3 of loops ( domains with one vertex ) . at the beginning of the injection ,",
    "the number of loops is equal to the number of self - contact points along the rod , but with the evolution of the process the contacts extend along segments of non - zero measure .",
    "different morphological conformations are observed for confined rods @xcite , and they depend on the plasticity and on the friction at the rod - cavity interface , as well as between different parts of the rod . for the tight - packing in a given area",
    ", it has been conjectured  @xcite that the topology of the cavity regulates an effective temperature of the system : the smaller the number of avoided regions , the greater the packed length , the higher the temperature .",
    "the following results stand out : ( _ i _ ) the successful application of an exponential description  @xcite also for annular cavities ; ( _ ii _ ) the observation of a new `` instability '' phenomenon ; and ( _ iii _ ) a new context in which the physical rigidity of the rod imposes an effective fractal dimension that is always smaller than 2 for the tight - packing conformations .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : in sec .",
    "[ secii ] the experiment of packing a single rod into annular cavities is detailed .",

    "the cavity is composed of the superposition of two acrylic plates of 10  mm thickness . a circular groove of diameter @xmath4  mm allows us to accommodate only one layer of the flexible rod of diameter @xmath5  mm .",
    "two opposite parallel slits compose the injection channels .",
    "the rod is then packed into the cavity from an injection channel and can be recovered by the other . the cavity is the same as used in previous studies  @xcite , but here we change its topology by adding a set of central aluminum disks ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) with a selected interval of more than one decade in diameter @xmath6  mm or more than three decades in the excluded area .",

    "( b ) the initial conformation with @xmath9 in length .",
    "( c ) the formation of the first loop , whose length is @xmath10 [ eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) ] . ]",
    "the total area available to the rod is @xmath11 for comparison , the experiment is also performed in a simply connected cavity ( without the central disk ) .",
    "inside mathematical expressions we mention simply connected cavity as `` scc '' .",
    "it is important in this study that @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) because in this limit we can distinguish the contribution of the topology .",
    "the flexible rod is a typical nylon fishing line of diameter @xmath13  mm with a young s modulus of about @xmath14  gpa .",
    "the initial conformation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . at the outer ends of the rod",
    "a mark in made with a permanent marker .",
    "the distance between these marks indicates the length of the rod in this initial condition , @xmath9 .",
    "once injected , the rod bends continuously changing its geometric pattern .",
    "a loop is a closed geometric teardrop shape composed of a vertex and a bulge .",
    "the first loop arises when the rod makes the first self - contact as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) . during the injection",
    "more loops are created inside the cavity , with several sizes and positions .",
    "our experiment consists of measuring the length needed to add a new loop to the total geometric pattern .",
    "when a new self - contact arises , the injection is stopped in order to mark the length on the rod with the marker .",
    "the injection speed is about @xmath15  cm / s , but a pause is taken to dry the ink and to carefully remove the excess .",
    "all injections are performed in a dry regime .",
    "compared to the simply connected cavity the presence of a central obstacle changes the disposition of the loops to the periphery of the cavity .",
    "the region close to the injection channel presents a denser concentration of the rod than in the opposite region of the cavity , behind the obstacle , which becomes scarcely available to the rod even at small values of @xmath7 .",
    "the size of the loops varies with the diameter of the central disk and therefore the total length needed to create @xmath3 loops depends on the area of the annulus .",
    "we are interested in investigating the total length needed to create a given quantity of loops in a global geometric pattern . assuming that the length needed to build @xmath3 loops is @xmath16 ,",
    "then the length @xmath17 needed to create a new loop is @xmath18 and the total length can be computed by summing up the distances between successive marks along the rod .",
    "the instrumental uncertainties are fixed for @xmath19 and increase with @xmath20 for @xmath16 ( although never more than @xmath21 ) .",
    "the injection ends when the system becomes jammed . in general the last mark on the rod",
    "does not indicate the tight - packing , because the system can become jammed after the formation of the last loop .",
    "the last mark corresponds to the total length needed to create @xmath22 loops in the cavity .",
    "after the injection , the rod is extracted through the opposite channel .",
    "the whole experiment consists of 10 identical realizations of packing of the flexible rod into an annular cavity .",
    "a total of 3907 loops are observed in 110 realizations .",
    "earlier studies claimed that the relationship between the number of loops and the length of the rod follows a power law  @xcite .",
    "however , the length of branches of the rod between successive self - contacts follows exponential distributions  @xcite . for regular folding  @xcite , the successive bending of a rod of length @xmath23 in the middle yields @xmath24 pieces of length @xmath25 between successive kinks , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which corresponds to a power - law scaling @xmath28 .",
    "we have observed that , since each loop has an individual length ( @xmath29 ) , the number of loops must be identified as the iteration of the process , and therefore we propose an exponential scaling .",
    "indeed , a recent study of the subject  @xcite introduces successfully an exponential law in order to describe the unpacking of a copper wire . in the present paper ,",
    "an exhaustive experimental analysis substantiates the exponential description of the packing of a flexible rod and an examination of its limitations demonstrates instabilities not reported before .",
    "this approach also enables a different point of view about the fractal behavior usually found for tight - packing configurations .",

    ", one can not consider @xmath9 for theoretical fits and one must find @xmath32 from extrapolation of all the data .",
    "the relationship between the cumulative length @xmath16 and the length between successive loops @xmath19 can be written as @xmath33 and it is in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) where @xmath34 . since @xmath32 is unknown",
    ", @xmath35 is initially unknown and it is different from the experimental value , @xmath36 . for annular cavities , generally @xmath37 and the theoretical fit for @xmath16 passes above the first data point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "the value of @xmath38 is higher than predicted by the theoretical line , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "the data for @xmath19 are very well described by an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath3 , as expected from simple arguments .",
    "consider the existence of a maximum length @xmath40 that can be injected inside the cavity .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the new loop is created by consuming a fraction of the available length @xmath41 : @xmath42 this equation can be iteratively used together with eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and  ( [ eq4 ] ) to obtain @xmath43 the total length @xmath16 [ eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) ] needed to create @xmath3 loops is then a limited quantity .",
    "for the formation of infinite loops we have @xmath44",
    ". we can write @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "our model thus yields an equation with three physical parameters : ( _ i _ )",
    "@xmath32 , a length of reference ; ( _ ii _ )",
    "@xmath47 , the saturation length ; and ( _ iii _ ) @xmath48 , a characteristic number of loops .",

    "the model is appropriate to describe the length of the rod which is adaptive to the whole structure within the cavity . in practice ,",
    "the elastic interaction among branches of the rod is followed up by internal movements .",
    "friction is responsible for intermittencies due to the stick - slip phenomenon .",
    "when the structure has enough loops and the insertion of a new one becomes uncertain due to the high rigidity , two situations are observed : ( _ i _ ) the system is tightly packed , and it is impossible to inject the rod further ; or ( _ ii _ ) the structure slides and a new area of the cavity becomes accessible ( fig .",

    "( b ) as the packing proceeds , the route of progressively smaller loops becomes unstable and new branches of larger loops can appear . ]    returning to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we can now examine a consequence of these instabilities : the length @xmath17 needed to insert the next loop is relatively large . as a consequence , there is a discontinuity in @xmath16 . in our experiment",
    "this occurs rather unpredictably ( 36% of realizations ) , and to the best of our knowledge , it has not been reported before in the literature on confined wires . the dry injection and the roughness of the cavities are pointed out as possible promoters of those instabilities . in cases of discontinuities , the theoretical fit is performed until a given number @xmath50 , immediately before the instability .",
    "the values of @xmath51 vary between @xmath52 for larger cavities ( with @xmath53  mm ) and @xmath54 for small cavities ( with @xmath55  mm ) .",
    "our experiment was projected to precisely evaluate the exponential growth , and discontinuities were found as unexpected ( unpredictable ) outcomes .",
    "for this reason , although we can carry out a qualitative discussion , we do not have enough data for a suitable investigation focused on those instabilities .",
    "while the total length of the rod plays the central physical role in determining the mass or the global rigidity of the system , the number of loops plays the role of time in the dynamic , in the sense that all physical quantities evolves when new loops are created .",

    ", we can obtain the fractal dimension @xmath56 of the global pattern as @xmath137 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq12 ] ) suggests that the fractal dimension of a pattern of infinite loops is @xmath138 .",
    "however , the physical limit of rigidity in the tight - packing imposes a deviation from the configuration of infinite loops and the tight - packing of a flexible rod in two - dimensional cavities gives an apparent fractal dimension @xmath139 as reported in the literature  @xcite . the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) shows the packing fraction @xmath140 as a function of the inner diameter of the annulus . from tight - packing measures",
    ", our result shows that the packing fraction is an increasing function when the initial length @xmath32 is ignored .",
    "this is the opposite effect of increasing the number of obstacles , which decreases the total packing fraction of the rod  @xcite .",
    "a divergence for @xmath141 is expected because an annulus of this width yields an initial packing fraction of @xmath142 .",
    "although we can not study the instabilities in greater detail , we report some results of interest .",
    "the number of experimental realizations with instabilities does not shown any tendency when the inner diameter @xmath7 changes . among all the realizations for a given @xmath7 ,",
    "there was at least one with instabilities , and on the other hand , there were at least three cases with no instabilities at all .",
    "the length of the rod inserted from the instability to the last loop is @xmath143 and it accumulates all discontinuities in the range @xmath144 . on average , @xmath145 corresponds to an increment @xmath146 in the packing fraction .",
    "however , the unpredictable behavior after the instabilities allows few realizations where @xmath145 can sum to about @xmath147 of the length inserted in the exponential domain @xmath148 .",
    "we point out that the exponential behavior is suitable for describing the formation of loops with the injection of flexible elastic rods into two - dimensional cavities .",
    "the global patterns have a clear size gradient characteristic of what has been called _ classical morphology _  @xcite . for less elastic filaments , one expects more instabilities to occur .",
    "we stress that further studies of those discontinuities will lead to better descriptions of the formation of loops in patterns of _ plastic morphology_.",
    "in this paper we report an exhaustive experimental study and analysis of the formation of loops in the packing of a flexible rod into annular cavities .",
    "the packing is treated as a discrete dynamical process that obeys an exponential model valid in simply connected cavities as well as in annular cavities .",
    "the length of formation of the first loop @xmath35 and the length of the rod needed to build infinite loops @xmath47 define the exponential parameters , given a reference length @xmath32 where the loops starts counting .",
    "the model points out that there are discontinuities in the total length for a number of loops @xmath3 larger than the threshold @xmath51 in @xmath149 of realizations .",
    "the tight - packing is also analyzed and we show that the physical limit for the rigidity of the system imposes an apparent fractal dimension that is always smaller than two as previously found in different experimental studies .",
    "our results in annular cavities are in agreement with previous claims which include changes in entropy due to the topology of the cavity and constant packing fraction for the effective isotherm curve of this system  @xcite .",
    "approximate complementary relationships of the packing problems discussed here with the classical problems of the random close packing of disks , and the jammed disk packing are pointed out .",
    "we urge that additional study of the system examined in this article is needed in order to clarify the influence of plasticity and elasticity in the phenomenon and , in particular , to further the examination of the origin of the discontinuities reported here , and the possible connection of the appearance of instabilities with traditional studies of dynamical systems .",
