    "the search for rare charmless hadronic decays of the @xmath0 meson to vector - vector final states has become a quite active field in the experiments at the @xmath0 factories , belle at kek and  at slac . as a lot of these decays have not yet been seen , the first goal of these studies is to observe such modes and measure their branching fraction .",

    "the direct cp - violation asymmetry in these modes can also be measured .",

    "some modes can be used for further cp studies .",

    "there are several possible explanations , either within the standard model , such as rescattering in the final state , contribution from annihilation or electroweak penguin diagrams , and transverse gluon  @xcite , or in new physics outside the standard model .",
