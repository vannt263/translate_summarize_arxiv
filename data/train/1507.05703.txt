    "recently , ben - tal and hertog @xcite show that if the two matrices in the objective function and the constraint of a quadratically constrained quadratic programming ( qcqp ) problem are simultaneously diagonalizable ( sd ) , this qcqp problem can be then turned into an equivalent second - order cone programming ( socp ) problem , which can be solved much faster than the semi - definite programming ( sdp ) reformulation .",
    "( note that to simply the notation , we use the abbreviation sd to denote both `` simultaneously diagonalizable '' and `` simultaneous diagonalization '' via congruence when no confusion will arise . )",
    "a natural question to ask is when a given pair of matrices are sd . essentially , the sd problem of a finite collection of symmetric matrices via congruence is one of the 14 open problems posted by hiriart - urruty @xcite nine years ago : `` a collection of @xmath0 symmetric @xmath1 matrices @xmath2 is said to be _ simultaneously diagonalizable via congruence _ if there exists a nonsingular matrix @xmath3 such that each of the @xmath4 is diagonal .",

    "a necessary and sufficient condition for sd of two matrices has been derived by uhlig in @xcite if at least one of the two matrices is nonsingular .",
    "a sufficient sd condition is well known for multiple matrices : if @xmath0 matrices commute with each other , then they are sd , see @xcite ( problems 22 and 23 , page 243 ) .",
    "the equivalence between the attainability of sd and a hidden convexity in qcqp stimulates the research in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a necessary and sufficient sd condition for any two real symmetric matrices , which extends the result in @xcite to any two arbitrary matrices .",
    "we then show its applications in qcqp with one quadratic inequality constraint or with an interval constraint .",
    "furthermore , we find a necessary and sufficient sd condition for @xmath0 ( @xmath19 ) real symmetric matrices when there is a semi - definite matrix pencil , i.e. , there exist @xmath20 ( not all of which are zero ) , such that @xmath21 .",
    "the semi - definite matrix pencil has been a widely adopted assumption in the solvability study in sdp and its duality @xcite .",
    "we also show its applications in qcqp and show that qcqp with two quadratic constraints has a non - trivial exact relaxation .",
    "our proofs are constructive for both cases of two matrices and multiple ( more than two ) matrices .",
    "thus , we essentially establish systematic procedures for testing sd using the derived sufficient and necessary condition for any finite number of symmetric matrices .",
