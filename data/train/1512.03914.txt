    "one of the main goals of modern theoretical physics is to develop a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "this consistent quantum theory of gravity will help us to understand two important and interesting physical problems ; one is the information loss problem of a black hole @xcite and the other is the initial singularity problem of the universe @xcite . even though there is no consensus on quantum gravity yet",
    ", we already briefly know that these problems should be fairly discussed by quantizing the spacetime , i.e. , by investigating the wave function of the universe via the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "the euclidean path integral approach gives good wisdom for these two problems @xcite .",
    "although the euclidean path integral is not a complete approach in the sense that the path integral is not bounded from below , this euclidean path integral is at least a good approximation of the ground state wave function .",
    "this wave function can be well approximated by solving on - shell solutions , so - called instantons .",
    "these instanton solutions present approximate but very important contributions as non - perturbative effects ; and all of these results will probably not be largely changed even when we eventually know a consistent theory of quantum gravity .    in this perspective , we focus on classical and quantum behaviors of thin - shell bubbles in einstein gravity . by using the thin - shell approximation @xcite",
    ", we can investigate not only the @xmath0 symmetry , but also the spherical symmetry .",
    "this means that now we can deal with non - perturbative effects of black holes and hence this can be related to the information loss problem ( for further review , see @xcite ) .",
    "as maldacena @xcite and hawking @xcite have pointed out , non - perturbative effects of a black hole will shed some light on the information loss problem @xcite .    more specifically , in this paper , we are interested in the interpretation of instantons . by interpretation , we mean the way to analytically continue instantons to lorentzian signatures , while an instanton itself is a solution in the euclidean signatures . as we discuss in the following sections , in the @xmath0-symmetric instantons @xcite , there are two competitive interpretations ; one is that the initial and final hypersurfaces are separated by instantons and the other is that the initial and final hypersurfaces are connected by instantons @xcite .",
    "the former is a more mathematically complete interpretation , while the latter is a more natural generalization from the interpretation of the minkowski case . in this paper , we regard the two interpretations as being complementary to each other . in addition , we generalize this complementary interpretation to thin - shell instantons that have less symmetry than the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this helps us to see the same instanton with a different point of view ; and we may find interesting solutions that will be helpful in understanding the information loss problem of black holes .",

    "the volume term of the hamiltonian approach @xcite corresponds to the regularization term around the cusp singularity of the euclidean geometry @xcite .",
    "this shows that the regularization technique of the euclidean manifold is indeed in a right way .",
    "this justification helps us to investigate more general instantons , where we remain for possible future projects .    for a thin - shell instanton",
    ", if the nothing - to - something interpretation is possible , then we can further interpret that a stationary black hole decays and emits an out - going shell ; and finally a black hole decreases its mass or even disappears .",
    "one remark is that fig .",
    "[ fig : ads_single ] is related to the work of hartle and hawking @xcite . in this path - integral derivation of hawking radiation @xcite",
    ", they constructed a tunneling of a particle ( energy @xmath175 , and hence one may neglect the back - reaction due to the emission of the particle ) , where the particle moves from inside to outside the black hole , and first moves backward in time and second moves forward in time .",
    "this process is not allowed classically , but the entire wave function allows such a process ; and the entire wave function can be approximated by a classical path that is analytically continued by the euclidean time .",
    "our result fig .",
    "[ fig : ads_single ] can be interpreted as a generalization of @xcite , but in our case , we can even consider the case that the emitted energy is comparable with the original black hole mass , since we have considered the back - reaction precisely .    since a black hole can disappear by a quantum process",
    ", this can shed some light on the information loss problem @xcite .",
    "this is not yet a very general solution , but if at once such a process exists , then information can be conserved through such a process @xcite . in terms of the entire wave function , information should be conserved but the classical equations of motion including general relativity may not need to be satisfied due to the superposition of classical geometries , and hence this can be interpreted as the firewall phenomena @xcite , while there is no real firewall that explicitly violates general relativity within a semi - classical background that can even be naked @xcite . on the other hand , for a semi - classical geometry , it satisfies local quantum field theory and general relativity , while it violates unitarity ; since hawking radiation does not contain information , it can be free from troubles with black hole complementarity @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we may name this idea the effective loss of information , since information is lost by a semi - classical observer , while the entire wave function conserves information , although it is fair to say that we need to generalize more on this process .",
