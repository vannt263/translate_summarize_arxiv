    "discovery of the universe accelerated expansion @xcite stirs up theoretical analysis aimed at explanation of the observational data . on the one hand ,",
    "most of approaches are based on exploration of the new kinds of substance ( quintessence , chaplygin s gases , phantom field , ghost condensate , and so on ) or of the new concepts of space - time ( extra - dimensions , holographic principle , string multiple vacuum ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was proposed that such an explanation can be based on an assumption that universe or its constituents are inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "the extreme point of view @xcite is to consider universe as inhomogeneous at the super - hubble scales and to assume that we live at the edge of `` hubble - bubble '' and thereby can observe either accelerated or decelerated expansion of universe , which is not described by the friedmann equations .",
    "also , one can assume that the accelerated expansion is produced by an internal motion of matter on a smaller scale ( like a galaxy formation one @xcite ) if the corresponding averaging procedure is defined for the universe scale factor @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is still attractive to consider the qft vacuum in a non - stationary space - time ( i.e. in an expanding universe ) as the source of the unverse acceleration .",
    "this can be achieved by exploring of two scales of universe : @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath0 is the `` size '' of universe ( of the order of its curvature or its inverse hubble constant for a flat space - time ) , @xmath2 is the planck mass associated with an appearance of new physics . whereas the direct ( `` naive '' ) consideration results in the huge value of vacuum density @xmath3 , the dimensional regularization of divergent expressions in a manner of minkowski qft gives the tiny value @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , there is a number of works @xcite obtaining @xmath5 that is consistent with the observed value of the universe acceleration .",
    "@xcite is simply an observation that the schwarzschild radius @xmath6 of universe with the `` mass '' @xmath7 has not to exceed the universe `` size '' @xmath0 .",
    "this excludes the `` naive '' value @xmath3 and results in @xmath5 as an upper limit .",
    "other works are based on the zeldovich s idea @xcite assuming that the source of the universe acceleration is not in itself the huge qft vacuum energy but some another quantity , namely , the square root of dispersion of the vacuum energy fluctuations .",
    "although the direct uv cut - off on the planck level in the friedmann equation does not provide the observed value of the acceleration parameter ( and is inconsistent with @xcite ) , one can use it in the equation of motion of the universe scale factor @xcite .",
    "it is found , that the effective cosmological constant results from the vacuum fluctuations of the massless scalar field and its value is concistent with @xmath8 .",
    "the point is that , in contrast to the friedmann equation which is held only up to some constant in such an approach , the equation of motion contains difference of the potential and kinetic energies of the field oscillators . in minkowski space - time this difference is exactly zero , because the virial theorem for an oscillator states that the kinetic energy is equal to the potential one in the virial equilibrium .",
    "however , in the expanding universe the difference is proportional to the hubble constant squared .",
    "this last tiny quantity is multiplied by the planck - order momentum cut - off squared that gives true order of the acceleration parameter .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze a number of fundamental fields , which can contribute to the cosmological constant , and to investigate a possibility of exact determination of the uv cut - off from the observed value of the acceleration parameter .",
    "in the case of the homogeneous isotropic flat universe filled with the different species of matter , lagrangian has the form @xcite : @xmath9 where the metric @xmath10 is assumed and @xmath11 is the planck mass .",
    "matter lagrangians are @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the spinor field and @xmath15 is the scalar field and three dimensional volume of integration is assumed to be unity .",
    "let us turn to the fourier - transform @xmath16 that leads to the scalar field lagrangian in the form    @xmath17    in the quasi - classical picture , where the universe scale factor is considered classically whereas the scalar field is quantum , equations of motion are :    @xmath18    here @xmath19 denotes averaging over the vacuum state .",
    "quantization of the scalar field @xcite @xmath20 leads to the operators of creation and annihilation with the commutation rules @xmath21=1 $ ] .",
    "the complex functions @xmath22 are @xmath23 for @xmath24 .    in the general case they satisfy the relations",
    "@xcite : @xmath25    eqs .",
    "( [ rel ] ) admit the formal wkb solution @xcite    @xmath26    where function @xmath27 satisfies the equation @xmath28 adiabatic approximation consists in setting @xmath29 .    at first",
    ", we shall consider the massless case @xmath30 in which the equation of motion contains exact difference of the kinetic and potential energies of the field oscillators .",
    "this difference is zero in the vacuum state of minkowski space . in the expanding universe it takes the form",
    "@xmath31 when the adiabatic approximation for the function @xmath32 is used . using ( [ 15 ] ) in ( [ sys ] ) yields the equation of motion for the universe scale factor in the form @xmath33 coming from the summation over @xmath34 ( in the general case it has to include summation over particle species ) to the integration , we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cutting parameter of the physical momentums and @xmath37 is the present day ( @xmath38 ) scale factor . finally , we come to the equation    @xmath39    where the density of classical matter ( dust ) @xmath40 and the number @xmath41 of species of scalar particles are introduced . here",
    "@xmath42 should be read as denoting the matter relative density and @xmath43 .",
    "consideration of eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) at @xmath38 allows determining the uv cut - off @xmath44 of physical momentum from the observed present day value of the universe acceleration @xmath45    now let us return to the massive particles . in this case there is no an exact difference of the kinetic and potential energies in the equation of motion because the multiplier @xmath46 appears in eq .",
    "( [ sys ] ) .",
    "subtraction of the main terms corresponding to the minkowski space - time can be used in this case as a primitive renormalization .",
    "let us remind that for @xmath24 @xmath47 the renormalization consists in rewriting of the equation of motion in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49    the simplest way of further consideraton is to assume some particular dependence @xmath50 and to calculate the quantity @xmath51 . as it was done in @xcite",
    ", one can choose the dependence @xmath52 which can be roughly associated with our present universe because it gives the acceleration parameter @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( here @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the hubble constant ) .",
    "calculation of the scalar field contribution to the universe acceleration up to second order in @xmath57 gives    @xmath58    where replacement of summation by integration over the momentum @xmath59 is proceeded and @xmath60 .",
    "one can see , that the mass terms are suppressed by the multiplier @xmath61 and are negligible , if one assumes that the mass of a particle is mach smaller than the planck mass .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the mass of the scalar particles has no impact .",
    "to consider the fermions in an expanding universe , we keep to the earlier work @xcite and the works @xcite , where preheating of universe was considered ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "after decomposing in the complete set of modes @xmath62 , the fermionic lagrangian ( [ ff ] ) takes the form @xmath63    the equations of motion are @xmath64 where quasi - classics is implied and dots denote matter ( dust ) , scalar field , photon field and other terms .",
    "fermion field is quantized as @xmath65 where the bispinor is : @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the bispinor @xmath69 is expressed as @xmath70 , where the symbol @xmath71 denotes the transpose vector and @xmath72 . the functions @xmath73 satisfy the equations    @xmath74    eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) reflects the time - dependence dictated by the bispinor equation of motion .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) is required to satisfy the anti - commutator relation @xmath75 , so that the operators @xmath76 satisfy @xmath77 and the similar relation is valid for @xmath78 . also , one has to note that the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) is the integral of motion of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) admits the wkb solution : @xmath79 where the function @xmath27 satisfies the equation : @xmath80    it should be noted , that eq .",
    "( [ wkf ] ) gives @xmath81 at @xmath30 and this can be seen directly from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ rel1 ] ) giving @xmath82 . in this case , the elementary calculations lead to @xmath83 thus , according to ( [ rr ] ) the massless fermions do not contribute to the universe acceleration .    to analyze the massive fermions ,",
    "let us assume the particular dependence @xmath50 given by ( [ aeta ] ) and calculate the quantity @xmath84 contained in eq .",
    "( [ rr ] ) .",
    "one can see that after subtraction of the first term ( which is equivalent to the `` renormalization '' ( [ renorm ] ) in the case of the scalar field ) , the remaining terms are suppressed by the multiplier @xmath85 in comparison with the acceleration term created by the vacuum of the massless scalar field .",
    "it seems that the negligible contribution of the massive terms is a general feature .",
    "indeed , the quantity @xmath86 is of the forth - order in mass . from the dimension arguments",
    ", it can be proportional to @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and two last terms are negligible in comparison with the first one at @xmath90 .",
    "note , that the term @xmath91 is forbidden by the time - reversal invariance arising from the fluctuation origin ( i.e. the vacuum fluctuations ) of the quantity under consideration .",
    "as one can see , that the massless fermions do not contribute to the universe acceleration .",
    "the deep - laid reason ( see for instance @xcite ) is conformality of the fermionic lagrangian if @xmath30 .",
    "other conformal lagrangians correspond to both photonic and scalar fields with the @xmath92 term for the latter @xcite . for shortness",
    "it is sufficiently to consider only the last lagrangian , which takes the form : @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "one can see , that the field oscillators are uncoupled from the universe scale factor in the case of @xmath30 and , thereby , do not contribute to the equation of motion for it .",
    "equivalent conclusion , that the massless conformal scalar field does not produce a vacuum polarization has been done in @xcite .",
    "let us turn to the pure gravity .",
    "small oscillations of the graviton oscillators near an equilibrium point can be considered on the basis of the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is known that the scalar and vector modes can not produce free oscillations without the matter fields @xcite . on the other hand , it is possible to expect that the matter fields are uncoupled from the scalar and vector perturbations at the planck frequencies , that is the frequencies providing main contribution to the vacuum energy within the framework of our approach .",
    "thus , the remaining perturbations are the tensor ones existing in an empty space .",
    "let us represent metric in the form , thus the quadratic terms on @xmath95 are kept in the metric . ]",
    "@xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "all components of the perturbation @xmath98 containing at least one zero index are equal to zero and the spatial components are represented as @xmath99^j_n\\,\\phi_{\\bm k}(\\eta)+\\bigl[\\mathcal y_{\\bm k}\\bigr]^j_n \\,y_{\\bm k}(\\eta)\\biggr)e^{i \\bm k",

    "for instance , when the @xmath34-vector is directed along @xmath105-axis , these tensors look as : @xmath106 for an arbitrary direction , they can be obtained from these expressions through the so(3)-transformation .    the next step is to substitute eqs .",
    "( [ metr ] ) , ( [ m2 ] ) in the gravity action @xmath107 , where @xmath108 according to @xcite .",
    "finally , in the second - order in @xmath109 , @xmath110 we come to    @xmath111    thus the tensor wave contributes to the vacuum energy as two scalar fields .",
    "in the case of the massless particles and when the conformal time is used , it is shown that the equation of motion of the universe scale factor contains the difference of potential and kinetic energies of field oscillators .",
    "calculation of the mean value of this quantity over the vacuum state leads to the universe accelerated expansion .",
    "the observed value of the universe acceleration allows determining the uv cut - off of the physical momentum given by eq .",

    "the composite particles decompose into their constituents .",
    "thus , @xmath41 should be read as a number of the fundamental scalar fields .    in a minimal variant of the standard model",
    "there is the su(2 ) duplet of complex scalar fields @xcite , i.e. four scalar degrees of freedom .",

    "still , the scale of the grand unfed theory @xmath116 gev seems closer to the planck scale and , hence there are ten scalar degrees of freedom for su(5 ) ( i.e. total twelve ) . then @xmath117 .",
    "scalar sectors of both the string theory and the supersymmetry one providing a number of the scalar superpartners of fermions demand a deeper insight .",
