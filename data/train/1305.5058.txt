    "<S> we investigate the quark - gluon mixed condensate @xmath0 for the su(2 ) light - flavor sector at finite temperature ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> relevant model parameters , such as the average ( anti)instanton size , inter-(anti)instanton distance , and constituent - quark mass at zero virtuality , are modified as functions of @xmath1 , employing the trivial - holonomy caloron solution . by doing that </S>",
    "<S> , we observe correct chiral restoration patterns depending on the current - quark mass @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform the two - loop renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution for the both condensates by increasing the renormalization scale @xmath3 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the mixed condensate is insensitive to the rg evolution , whereas the quark condensate become larger considerably by the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we obtain @xmath4 gev at @xmath5 within the present theoretical framework , and the mixed condensate plays the role of the chiral order parameter for finite @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the two condensates @xmath6 is almost flat below the chiral transition @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) , and increases rapidly beyond it . from a simple linear parametrization </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath8 for @xmath9 at @xmath10 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the present results are compared with other theoretical ones including the lattice qcd simulations , and show qualitatively good agreement with them . </S>"
