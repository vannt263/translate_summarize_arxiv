    "while hst customers were crossing their fingers , the sts-114 camera system exhibited a spectacular scene of a top - hat shape @xmath6 insulation foam flying off the external tank .",
    "the public release of the foam loss locations by nasa shown in fig.1 read as follows .",
    "1 .   lh2 pal ramp : @xmath7 section near stattion xt-1281 released at 127.1 sec met ; 2 .   @xmath8 divot on the forward outboard portion of the -y bipod closeout at 148.1 sec met ; 3 .",

    "shallow divot ( @xmath11 ) in lh2 tank ice / frost ramp at xt-1841 ; 6 .   divot ( @xmath12 dia ) @xmath13 ft below the -y bipod fitting ( xt-1163 ) at 135.8 sec met ; 7 .",
    "shallow divot ( @xmath14 dia ) in lh2 tank acreage between lo2 feedline and pressline ( xt-1839 ) ; 8 .",
    "2 divots ( @xmath15 dia ) on upper intertank / lh2 tank flange closeout on -y axis ( release time unknown ) .",
    "the press release by nasa immediately following the dislodge of the large @xmath0 lbs piece of insulation foam from pal ramp indicates nasa s continuing efforts to prevent defects in foam bubbles and to tame supersonic vortices and turbulences as it reads in the last paragraph :  ...",
    "an enhanced spray process is in work for future tanks , as well as continued work in developing redesign options including elimination of the ramps ; reducing the ramps sizes by two thirds ; or building a trailing edge ` fence ' on the back side of the cable tray , which would act like a nozzle throat and prevent unsteady flow in that area . \"",
    "the divots in items 2 and 8 in section[secfoamloss ] are from the left side ( -y ) of the bipod area .",
    "this is exactly the same area where the @xmath1 lbs piece of foam broke off from the ramp and doomed shuttle columbia in 2003 .",
    "the ramps have been removed , and the surface of the foam in the bipod area has been streamlined since .",
    "but , the air managed to dump enough energy to break off large chunks from the streamlined foam .",
    "the fourth volume of the columbia accident investigation board ( caib ) report exhibits a result of hydrodynamic simulations that shows streamline vortices around the -y bipod area .",
    "we have no clue , especially not being an expert either in supersonic hydrodynamics or in external tank configurations , whether the vortices around the obstacles of the struts that hold the nose of the shuttle can be tamed without undesirable , or unpredictable and untested , side effects . however , nasa s investments of 2.5 years and @xmath16 billion dollars since coumbia accident point to a possibility that the same line of efforts cited in the first paragraph of this section might have already served its capacity .",
    "an alternative is suggested to strengthen the insulated external fuel tank with fish - net stockings made of high temperature resistant ceramic fibers that are immediately available .",
    "oxide fiber 3 m nextel 720 manufactured by 3 m technologies is considered .",
    "* 3.2.1.2.17 external tank debris limits : * _ no debris shall emanate from the critical zone of the external tank on the launch pad or during ascent except for such material which may result from normal thermal protection system recession due to ascent heating . _",

    "the report continues ,  the assumption that only tiny pieces of debris would strike the orbiter was also built into original design requirements , which specified that the thermal protection system ( the tiles and rcc panels ) would be built to withstand impacts with a kinetic energy less than @xmath17 foot - pounds . \"",

    "allowed mass of a foam debris , we need to know the areodynamic velocity due to the ascending motion of the spacecraft and wind , air density , streamline , etc , as a function of time and the position in the external tank . a recent review , found in the web site of lockheed martin ,  sts-114 flight readiness review : external tank ( et-121 ) , \"",
    "appendix d , p.5 , june 29 - 30 , 2005 , indicates that the mass of a foam debris should not exceed @xmath24 .",

    "3 .   table 7.2.1.8.1.2.6-1 of caib report titled  summary of acreage stress analysis parameters \" lists flight requirement ( foam ) cell pressures in various parts of the foam insulation on the external tank : oxygen tank : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 depending on the parts ; intertank : @xmath32 ; hydrogen tank : @xmath33 , and bond tension test requirement : @xmath34 .",
    "hence we take @xmath35 as the tensile strength requirement of the ceramic fiber grid structure .",
    "high tensile strength fibers are based in carbon , sic , and @xmath22 .",
    "space shuttle rcc panels  now a household name since the columbia accident  are made of carbon fiber composite matrix with sic protection coating and glassy sealant@xmath36 . during the reentry of the shuttle ,",
    "the sealant melts forming an air tight thin film .",
    "a report indicates that oxide fiber tows ( or roving : loose bundle of untwisted fibers ) perform better than sic - based tows in the condition under consideration where it is highly oxidating and the usage time is short ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the interactions within the bundle make the tow weaker or stronger in terms of creep or rupture in comparison to the average strength of the single fiber . at @xmath38 ,",
    "single fiber sic outperforms sic tow ; at @xmath39 , sic tow outperforms single fiber sic .",
    "we consider an oxide fiber 3 m nextel 720 .",
    "3 m nextel 720 fiber is a continuous fiber with the composition of 85% @xmath22 and 15% @xmath40 , melting temperature @xmath41 , density @xmath42 , the filament tensile strength @xmath43 at @xmath44 guage , the diamter @xmath45 , and the crystal phase @xmath21-@xmath22+mullite .",
    "nextel oxide fibers are various mixtures of @xmath22 , @xmath40 , and @xmath46 .",
    "fiber 610 is made of pure @xmath22 ( @xmath47 ) and its crystal phase is @xmath21-@xmath22 .    figure [ fig_720roving ] shows the stable strength of fiber 720 tow in high temperatures .",
    "( 3 m nextel oxide fiber tows come in fiber counts of 400 or 750 . )",
    "figures [ fig_singlefiber ] and [ fig_heating90sec ] show the single fiber tensile strengths of the fibers 610 and 720 in room temperature and high temperatures where the high temperature heatings lasted about 90 seconds .",
    "( note that the maximum aerodynamic friction and heating occurs around @xmath48 seconds after the launch . )",
    "the fiber 610 is stronger at room temperature , but fiber 720 is preferred because of the stability of the strength in high temperatures .",
    "comparision of figures [ fig_720roving ] and [ fig_heating90sec ] shows that the fiber 720 tow performs better than single fiber at higher temperatures ( @xmath49 ) consistently with the report by dy .",
    "the concern of foam shedding is on the area where the aerodynamic stress is high , and the design requirement of the temperature tolerance due to aerodynamic heating is @xmath38 . within the temperature range ,",
    "fiber 720 shows excellent strength behavior and also very slight difference in the strengths between a tow and an average single fiber .",
    "the temperature tolerance requirements for the areas with heating from solid rocket booster and from main engine are very high with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "foam shedding or ablation from those areas ( aft dome and lower part of the acreage ) is not a concern in regard to the potential damage to the thermal protection systems ( tps ) , and reinforcement fibers should not be used to avoid generating unnecessary potential hazard of loose fiber fragments or melts .      1 .",
    "the total acreage of the external tank foam insulation is @xmath52 .",
    "( the total mass of the foam is @xmath53 . )",
    "the area that needs fiber reinforcement is likely to be less than @xmath54 , and @xmath54 will be considered the fiducial acreage .",
    "most of the foam loss seems to come from intertank area where liquid oxygen tank and liquid hydrogen tank are joined ( caib report ) .",
    "2 .   consider a single fiber one inch square cell grid .",
    "the number of cells in the grid is @xmath55 , the total length of the fiber in the grid is @xmath56 , and the total mass is @xmath57 .",
    "( according to 3mttn , 400 fiber count tow has 1500 denier ( denier = number of grams in 9000 m or 10000 yd of a product ) . )",
    "assuming absolute no failure of the single fiber grid , added weight of @xmath57 of fibers will keep the foams from being released .",
    "it is most likely not practicable , but the negligibly small mass of the single fiber grid is a good news",
    ". the cost of the single fiber grid will be $ 66 .",
    "it is only getting better .",
    "the tensile strength measurement is done with a short piece of fiber of length @xmath58 , and i did not find failure probability of long fibers in 3mttn .",
    "the total strength equivalent of 400 or 750 fibers of the commercial products may be more than fail - safe for the lengths of the girth and height of the appication area of the external tank .",
    "one can consider woven yarns or very narrow fabric to replace the single fiber strand for the grid .",
    "the ceramic fiber net may be embedded near the surface of the foam or wrap the surface .",
    "a 1500 fiber - equivalent strength grid will add mass @xmath59 with the price tag of $ 100,000 .",
    "the analysis is preliminary and the mass estimation is made over a broad range because of the lacking information of the properties of long fibers , exact behavior of the insulation foam under stresses , and so the engineering formulation of the grid . for example , the foam will have surface waves generated by the aerodynamic flows , and the fiber ( yarn ) would need to have certain elasticity whether the fiber grid is embedded or on the surface . where the estimated young modulus of the foam is @xmath60 .",
    "] the proper elasticity may be engineered through the bundle structure such as braiding or weaving .",
    "inelastic fiber can act as a  diamond string saw \" to an adverse effect .",
    "even if it shaves off only benignly small pieces , it should be best to avoid generating additional foam flakes .    in summary",
    ", a ceramic - fiber - grid reinforcement can eliminate foam - shedding problem .",
    "the projected mass and price of the grid are small .",
    "there are some details to be specified to engineer a practical ceramic - fiber grid that will secure insulation foam of the external tank  economically . ",
    "no foam loss \" makes the flight safer and reduces turn - around repair costs .",
    "we call for cooperations from the interested parties .",
    "we appreciate discussions with j.a.dicarlo on creep properties of tows and introduction to 3 m technologies and with 3 m technologies personnel on nextel fibers and the costs , and the library of university of notre dame for the access of reference books ."
