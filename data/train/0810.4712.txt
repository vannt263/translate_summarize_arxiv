    "as of today , there are 23 known extragalactic very high energy ( vhe , defined here as @xmath7gev ) @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "all of them are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with relativistic jets . with the exception of the radio galaxy m  87 all detected sources are blazars , whose jets ( characterized by a bulk lorentz factor @xmath8 ) point , within a small angle ( @xmath9 ) , to the observer .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed , logarithm of the observed energy density versus logarithm of the photon energy ) of agns shows typically a two - bump structure .",
    "the lower - energy bump originates from synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons spiraling in the magnetic field of the jet .",
    "for the origin of the high - frequency bump , various models have been proposed , the most popular invoking inverse compton scattering of ambient photons .",
    "there have been several suggestions for the origin of the low - frequency seed photons that are up - scattered to @xmath0-ray energies : they may be produced within the jet by synchrotron radiation ( synchrotron self - compton or ssc mechanism ,",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or come from outside the jet ( external compton or ec mechanism , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "relativistic effects boost the observed emission as the doppler factor depends on the angle to the line of sight . for sources with a large angle between the jet and the line of sight ( e.g. , the radio galaxy m  87 ) , these classic inverse compton scenarios can not account for the vhe @xmath0-ray emission . in this case , models that depend less critically on beaming effects are needed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vhe @xmath0-ray emission of agns might also be of hadronic origin through the emission from secondary electrons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "3c  66a and 3c  66b are two agns separated by just @xmath10 in the sky .",
    "3c  66b is a large fanaroff  riley - i - type ( fri ) radio galaxy , similar to m  87 , with a redshift of 0.0215 @xcite , whereas 3c  66a is a blazar with uncertain redshift .",
    "the often referred redshift of 0.444 @xcite for 3c  66a is based on a single measurement of one emission line only ( and the authors were not certain on the realness of the feature ) , while in later observations no lines in the spectra of 3c  66a were reported @xcite . based on the marginally resolved host galaxy @xcite , a photometric redshift of @xmath11 was inferred .",
    "3c  66a , a promising candidate for vhe @xmath0-ray emission , was observed several times with satellite - borne and ground - based @xmath0-ray detectors .",
    "the egret source 3eg  j0222 + 4253 was associated with 3c  66a @xcite , but the association was ambiguous because the error box is large enough to cover 3c  66b and the nearby pulsar psr  j0218 + 4232 @xcite . in the tev regime the crimean astrophysical observatory s gt-48 imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescope has claimed repeated detections of this source above 900gev @xcite with a flux as high as @xmath12@xmath5s@xmath4 .",

    "the results of the analysis are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 .",
    "3c  66a underwent an optical outburst in 2007 august , as monitored by the tuorla blazar monitoring program .",
    "the outburst triggered vhe @xmath0-ray observations of the source with the magic telescope following the target of opportunity program , which resulted in discoveries of new vhe @xmath0-ray sources in the past @xcite .",

    "note that in the case of an optimal pointing model the systematic uncertainty is below @xmath25 , being @xmath26 on average @xcite .",

    "an @xmath35alpha@xmath35 distribution was produced , where alpha is the angle between the major axis of the shower image ellipse and the source position in the camera . for the calculation of the source - dependent image parameters we considered the fitted position of the excess .",

    "as in the case of the light curve , we can not exclude that 3c  66a contributes to the measured signal .",
    "thus , the spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] represents a combined @xmath0-ray spectrum from the observed region .",
    "a new vhe @xmath0-ray source magic  j0223 + 430 was detected in 2007 august to december .",

    "the differential spectrum of magic  j0223 + 430 has a photon spectral index of @xmath45 and extends up to @xmath46tev . in view of the recent detection of 3c  66a at vhe @xmath0-rays @xcite",
    ", we note that if 3c  66a was emitting @xmath0-rays in 2007 august to december then its flux was at a significantly lower level than in 2008 .",
    "we also note that we can not exclude the scenario suggested in a recent work by @xcite that the observed spectrum would be a combination of emission from 3c  66b ( dominating at energies above 150gev ) and blazar 3c  66a ( at lower energies ) .      in the unlikely case , excluded with probability 85.4% , that the total signal and observed spectrum presented in this paper originates from 3c  66a ,",
    "the redshift of the source is likely to be significantly lower than previously assumed . due to the energy - dependent absorption of vhe @xmath0-rays with low - energy photons of the extragalactic background ( ebl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the vhe @xmath0-ray flux of distant sources is significantly suppressed .",
    "we investigated the measured spectrum by magic following the prescription of @xcite , and derived a redshift upper limit of the source to be @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) under the assumption that the intrinsic energy spectrum can not be harder than @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this assumption of @xmath51 is based on particle acceleration arguments @xcite , and the fact that none of the sources in the egret energy band ( not affected by the ebl ) have shown a harder spectrum .",
    "the latter assumption of @xmath52 can be considered as an extreme case of the spectrum hardness , suggesting a monochromatic spectrum of electrons when interacting with a soft photon target field @xcite .",
    "if @xmath53 for 3c  66a , an alternative explanation for a hard intrinsic spectrum at energies above 100gev can be given if @xmath0-rays are passing through a narrow band of optical - infrared photons in the vicinity of the blazar .",
    "such narrow radiation fields can produce arbitrarily hard intrinsic spectra by absorbing specific energies of @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "we also note that , in this case , the intrinsic vhe luminosity of 3c  66a should exceed @xmath54ergs@xmath4 , which is an unusually large value for a bl  lac object @xcite , also in view of its spectral characteristics @xcite .",
    "3c  66b is a fri radio galaxy similar to m  87 , which has been detected to emit vhe @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "since the distance of 3c  66b is 85.5mpc , its intrinsic vhe luminosity would be two to eight times higher than the one of m  87 ( 22.5mpc ) given the reported variability of m  87 @xcite .",
    "as in the case of m  87 , there would be several possibilities for the region responsible of the tev radiation in 3c  66b : the vicinity of the supermassive black hole @xcite , the unresolved base of the jet ( in analogy with blazar emission models ; * ? ? ? * ) and the resolved jet . unlike for m  87",
    ", we do not observe significant variability in the vhe @xmath0-ray flux and therefore we have no constrains on the size of the emission region .",
    "however , as the angle to line of sight is even larger than in m  87 ( m  87 : 19@xmath55 , @xcite ; 3c  66b : 45@xmath55 , @xcite ) the resolved jet seems an unlikely site of the emission . on the other hand , the unresolved base of the jet seems a likely candidate for the emission site as it could point with a smaller angle to the line of sight .",
    "if the viewing angle was small , blazar - like emission mechanisms can not be excluded .",
    "the orbital motion of 3c  66b shows evidence for a supermassive black hole binary ( smbhb ) with a period of @xmath56 years @xcite . the smbhb would likely cause the jet to be helical , and the pointing direction of the unresolved jet could differ significantly from the direction of the resolved jet .",
    "given the likely association of magic  j0223 + 430 with 3c  66b , our detection would establish radio galaxies as a new class of vhe @xmath0-ray emitting sources .",
    "according to @xcite , there are eight fr i radio galaxies in the 3cr catalog that should have a higher @xmath0-ray flux at 100mev than 3c 66b , but possibly many of these sources are rather weak in the vhe @xmath0-ray band",
