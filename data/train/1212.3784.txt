    "its measured mass @xmath31 mev is also consistent with that measured in the charged mode . since @xmath32 s are isotriplet states , they need at least four quarks as minimal constituents , which makes them ideal candidates for exotic hadrons beyond the conventional @xmath33 mesons .",
    "note that the decay rates of @xmath34 are comparable to those of @xmath35 .",

    "our results show that the @xmath5 dependence of the branching ratios are quite stable , which indicate the dominant mechanism driven by the intermediate meson loops with a fairly well control of the uv contributions .",
    "we also pointed out that the results become sensitive to the meson loop contributions when the final state mass threshold are close to the intermediate meson thresholds in our calculation .",
    "namely , the effects from the unphysical pole introduced by the form factors would interfere with the nearby physical poles from the internal propagators and lead to model - dependent uncertainties .",
    "it is also a consequence of the violation of local quark - hadron duality .",
    "such a phenomenon has been discussed in ref .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies  @xcite of the consequences from such an intermediate meson loop effects would be important for providing more quantitative information on the structure of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
