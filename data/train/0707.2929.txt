    "the past 25 years have seen substantial progress in the physical understanding of insulating and metallic behavior in disordered quantum hamiltonian systems of the random schrdinger and random band matrix type .",
    "a major role in this development , bearing especially on the metallic regime and the metal - insulator transition , has been played by the method of commuting and anti - commuting variables , or supersymmetry method for short . assuming a gaussian distribution for the disorder",
    ", this method proceeds by making a hubbard - stratonovich transformation followed by a saddle - point approximation ( or elimination of the massive modes ) to arrive at an effective field theory of the non - linear sigma model type .",
    "this effective description has yielded many new results including , e.g. , the level statistics in small metallic grains , localization in thick disordered wires , and a scaling theory of critical systems in higher dimension @xcite .    while the method has been widely used and successfully so , there exist some limitations and drawbacks . for one thing ,",
    "the method works well only for systems with normal - distributed disorder ; consequently , addressing the universality question for non - gaussian distributions ( like the invariant ensembles studied via the orthogonal polynomial method ) has so far been beyond reach . for another , the symmetries of the effective theory are not easy to keep manifest when using the mathematically well - founded approach of schfer and wegner @xcite .",
    "a problem of lesser practical relevance is that the covariance matrix of the random variables , which is to be inverted by the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , does not always have an inverse @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new variant of the supersymmetry approach which is complementary to the traditional one .",
    "inspired by the method of bosonization of dirac fermions , and following an appellation by efetov and coworkers , we refer to the new method as ` superbosonization ' .",
    "as we will see , in order for superbosonization to be useful the distribution of the random hamiltonians must be invariant under some symmetry group , and this group can not be ` too small ' in a certain sense .",
    "we expect the method to be at its best for random matrix ensembles with a local gauge symmetry such as wegner s @xmath3-orbital model @xcite with gauge group @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 .",
    "superbosonization differs in several ways from the traditional method of schfer and wegner @xcite based on the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation : ( i ) the superbosonization field has the physical dimension of 1/energy ( whereas the hs field has the dimension of energy ) .",
    "( ii ) for a fixed symmetry group @xmath7 , the target space of the superbosonization field is always the _ same _ product of compact and non - compact symmetric spaces regardless of where the energy parameters are , whereas the hs field of the schfer - wegner method changes as the energy parameters move across the real axis . (",
    "iii ) the method is not restricted to gaussian disorder distributions .",
    "( iv ) the symmetries of the effective theory are manifest at all stages of the calculation .",
    "a brief characterization of what is meant by the physics word of ` superbosonization ' is as follows .",
    "the point of departure of the supersymmetry method ( in its old variant as well as the new one ) is the fourier transform of the probability measure of the given ensemble of disordered hamiltonians .",
    "this fourier transform is evaluated on a supermatrix built from commuting and anti - commuting variables and thus becomes a superfunction ; more precisely a function , say @xmath8 , which is defined on a complex vector space @xmath9 and takes values in the exterior algebra @xmath10 of another complex vector space @xmath11 . if the probability measure is invariant under a group @xmath7 , so that the function @xmath12 is equivariant with respect to @xmath7 acting on @xmath9 and @xmath11 , then a standard result from invariant theory tells us that @xmath12 can be viewed as the pullback of a superfunction @xmath13 defined on the quotient of @xmath14 by the group @xmath15 .",
    "the heart of the superbosonization method is a formula which reduces the integral of @xmath12 to an integral of the lifted function @xmath16 .",
    "depending on how the dimension of @xmath17 compares with the rank of @xmath7 , such a reduction step may or may not be useful for further analysis of the integral . roughly speaking , superbosonization gets better with increasing value of @xmath18 . from a mathematical perspective",
    ", superbosonization certainly promises to become a powerful tool for the investigation and proof of the universality of spectral correlations for a whole class of random matrix ensembles that are not amenable to treatment by existing techniques .",
    "let us now outline the plan of the paper . in sects .",
    "[ sect:1.1 ] and [ sect:1.2 ] we give an informal introduction to our results , which should be accessible to physicists as well as mathematicians",
    ". a concise summary of the motivation ( driven by random matrix applications ) for the mathematical setting of this paper is given in sect .",
    "[ sect : susy - method ] .    in sect .",
    "[ sect : bb - sector ] we present a detailed treatment of the special situation of @xmath19 ( the so - called boson - boson sector ) , where anti - commuting variables are absent .",
    "this case was treated in an inspiring paper by fyodorov @xcite , and our final formula  the transfer of the integral of @xmath12 to an integral of @xmath13  coincides with his .",
    "the details of the derivation , however , are different . while fyodorov employs something he calls the ingham - siegel integral , our approach proceeds directly by push forward to the quotient @xmath20 .",
    "another difference is that our treatment covers each of the three classical symmetry groups @xmath21 , @xmath5 , and @xmath22 , not just the first two .    sect .  [ sect : ff - sector ] handles the complementary situation @xmath23 ( the so - called fermion - fermion sector ) . in this case",
    "the starting point is the berezin integral of @xmath24 , i.e. , one differentiates once with respect to each of the anti - commuting variables , or projects on the top - degree component of @xmath25 . from a theoretical physicist s perspective , this case is perhaps the most striking one , as it calls for the mysterious step of transforming the berezin integral of @xmath12 to an integral of the lifted function @xmath13 over a compact symmetric space .",
    "the conceptual difficulty here is that many choices of @xmath13 exist , and any serious theoretical discussion of the matter has to be augmented by a proof that the final answer does not depend on the specific choice which is made .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sect : full - susy ] handles the full situation where @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( i.e. , both types of variable , commuting and anti - commuting , are present ) .",
    "heuristic ideas as to how one might tackle this situation are originally due to lehmann , saher , sokolov and sommers @xcite and to hackenbroich and weidenmller @xcite .",
    "these ideas have recently been pursued by efetov and his group @xcite and by guhr @xcite , but their papers are short of mathematical detail  in particular , the domain of integration after the superbosonization step is left unspecified  and address only the case of unitary symmetry . in sect .",
    "[ sect : full - susy ] we supply the details missing from these earlier works and prove the superbosonization formula for the cases of @xmath28 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , giving sufficient conditions of validity in each case . while it should certainly be possible to construct a proof based solely on supersymmetry and invariant - theoretic notions including howe dual pairs , lie superalgebra symmetries and the existence of an invariant berezin measure , our approach here is different and more constructive : we use a chain of variable transformations reducing the general case to the cases dealt with in sects .",

    "we are going to consider integrals over these variables in the sense of berezin .",

    "the other factor is lebesgue measure for the commuting complex variables @xmath45 .",
    "we here denote such integrals by @xmath46 for short .",
    "the domain of integration will be the linear space of all complex rectangular @xmath47 matrices @xmath45 , with @xmath48 being the hermitian adjoint of @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that our integrands @xmath12 decrease at infinity so fast that the integral @xmath49 exists .    in the present paper we will be discussing such integrals for the particular case where the integrand @xmath12 has a lie group symmetry .",
    "more precisely , we assume that a lie group @xmath7 is acting on @xmath50 and this group is either the unitary group @xmath51 , or the real orthogonal group @xmath5 , or the unitary symplectic group @xmath6 .",
    "the fundamental @xmath7-action on @xmath50 gives rise to a natural action by multiplication on the left resp .",
    "right of our rectangular matrices : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath12 to be integrated shall have the property of being @xmath7-invariant : @xmath57 we wish to establish a reduction formula for the berezin integral @xmath49 of such functions .",
    "this formula will take a form that varies slightly between the three cases of @xmath21 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "let then @xmath12 be an analytic and @xmath61-invariant function of our basic variables @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "we now make the further assumption that @xmath12 extends to a @xmath64-invariant _ holomorphic _ function when @xmath45 and @xmath65 are viewed as _ independent _ complex matrices ; which means that the power series for @xmath12 in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath65 converge everywhere and that the symmetry relation ( [ eq : k - symmetry ] ) for the extended function @xmath12 holds for all @xmath66 , the complexification of @xmath51 .",
    "the rationale behind these assumptions about @xmath12 is that they guarantee the existence of another function @xmath13 which lies ` over ' @xmath12 in the following sense .",
    "it is a result of classical invariant theory @xcite that the algebra of @xmath64-invariant polynomial functions in @xmath45 , @xmath65 , @xmath41 , @xmath67 is generated by the quadratic invariants @xmath68 here we are introducing the summation convention : an index that appears twice , once as a subscript and once as a superscript , is understood to be summed over .",
    "how does this invariant - theoretic fact bear on our situation ? to answer that , let @xmath13 be a holomorphic function of complex variables @xmath69 , @xmath70 and anti - commuting variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 with index range @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "again , let us organize these variables in the form of matrices , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , etc .",
    ", and write @xmath13 as @xmath77 then the relevant statement from classical invariant theory in conjunction with @xcite is this : given any @xmath78-invariant holomorphic function @xmath12 of the variables @xmath79 , it is possible to find a holomorphic function @xmath13 of the variables @xmath80 so that @xmath81 to be sure , there exists no unique choice of such function @xmath13 . indeed , since the top degree of the grassmann algebra generated by the anti - commuting variables @xmath33 and @xmath82 is @xmath83 , any monomial in the matrix variables @xmath84 of degree higher than @xmath85 vanishes identically upon making the substitution @xmath86 .    in the following",
    ", we will use the abbreviated notation @xmath87 where the symbol @xmath88 stands for the supermatrix built from the matrices @xmath89 @xmath90      in the case of the symmetry group being @xmath91 the complex vector space @xmath50 is equipped with a non - degenerate symmetric tensor @xmath92 ( which you may think of as the kronecker delta symbol ) . by definition , the elements @xmath93 of the orthogonal group @xmath94 satisfy the conditions @xmath95 and @xmath96 where @xmath97 means the transpose of the matrix @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 denote the components of the inverse tensor , @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 we now have the following independent quadratic @xmath7-invariants : @xmath105    in the case of symplectic symmetry , the dimension @xmath3 has to be an even number and @xmath50 is equipped with a non - degenerate skew - symmetric tensor @xmath106 .",
    "elements @xmath93 of the unitary symplectic group @xmath107 satisfy the conditions @xmath108 and @xmath109 . if @xmath110 are the components of @xmath111 , the extra quadratic invariants for this case are @xmath112    to deal with the two cases of orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in parallel , we introduce the notation @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath59 , and we organize all quadratic invariants as a supermatrix : @xmath116 this particular matrix arrangement is motivated as follows .",
    "let @xmath88 be the supermatrix ( [ eq : def - q ] ) of before , but now double the size of each block ; thus @xmath117 here is a matrix of size @xmath118 , the rectangular matrix @xmath119 is of size @xmath120 , and so on . then impose on @xmath88 the symmetry relation @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 means the supertranspose : @xmath124 it is easy to check that the supermatrix ( [ eq : invariants ] ) obeys precisely this relation @xmath125 .    for the symmetry groups @xmath91 and",

    "@xmath133      a few more definitions are needed to state our main result , which transfers the integral of @xmath12 to an integral of @xmath13 .    in ( [ eq : fund - int ] ) the definition of the berezin integral @xmath134 was given .",
    "let us now specify how we integrate the ` lifted ' function @xmath13 , beginning with the case of @xmath21 .",
    "there , the domain of integration will be @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the symmetric space of positive hermitian @xmath137 matrices and @xmath138 is the group of unitary @xmath139 matrices , @xmath140 .",

    "these publications , however , do not give an answer to the important question of which integration domain to choose for @xmath155 .",
    "noting that the work of efetov et al .",
    "is concerned with the case of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , let us emphasize that the inequality @xmath158 is in fact necessary in order for our formula ( [ bosonize ] ) to be true .",
    "( the situation for @xmath159 is explored in a companion paper @xcite . )",
    "moreover , be advised that analogous formulas for the related cases of @xmath160 have not been discussed at all in the published literature .    turning to the latter two cases , we introduce two @xmath161 matrices @xmath162 and @xmath163 @xmath164 where @xmath165 or @xmath166 depending on the context .",
    "then let a linear space @xmath167 for @xmath168 or @xmath169 be defined by @xmath170 thus the elements of @xmath167 are complex @xmath161 matrices which are symmetric with respect to transposition followed by conjugation with @xmath171 . with this notation , we can rephrase the condition @xmath172 for the blocks @xmath117 resp .",

    "thus in both cases , @xmath175 and @xmath182 , the integration domains @xmath183 and @xmath184 are constructed by taking the intersection with the positive hermitian matrices and the unitary matrices , respectively .",
    "the berezin superintegral form @xmath185 for the cases @xmath186 has the expression @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",

    "( the entries of @xmath191 are determined from those of @xmath119 by the relation @xmath192 ) . for @xmath175",
    "one defines @xmath193 while for @xmath182 the definition is the same except that the ordering of the derivatives @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the second product has to be reversed .",
    "it remains to define the measures @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "to do so , we first observe that the complex group @xmath198 acts on @xmath199 by conjugation in a twisted sense : @xmath200 a derived group action on the restriction to the positive hermitian matrices is then obtained by restricting to the subgroup @xmath201 defined by the condition @xmath202 this subgroup @xmath203 turns out to be @xmath204 for @xmath205 and @xmath206 , the invertible @xmath137 matrices whose entries are real quaternions , for @xmath207 . in the sector of @xmath84 ,",
    "the unitary group @xmath208 acts on @xmath209 by the same twisted conjugation , @xmath210 now in all cases , @xmath196 and @xmath211 are measures on @xmath183 and @xmath184 which are invariant by the pertinent group action",
    ". since the group actions at hand are transitive , all of our invariant measures are unique up to multiplication by a constant .",
    "as before , we consider a gaussian limit in order to fix the normalization constant : @xmath212 the normalization of @xmath211 is specified by the corresponding formula where we make the replacements @xmath213 , and @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .",
    "an explicit expression for each of these invariant measures is given in the appendix .",
    "we are now ready to state the superbosonization formula for the cases of orthogonal and symplectic symmetry .",
    "let the inequality of dimensions @xmath216 be satisfied .",
    "we then assert that the following is true .",
    "let the berezin integral @xmath49 still be defined by ( [ eq : fund - int ] ) , but now assume the holomorphically extended integrand @xmath12 to be @xmath129-invariant with complexified symmetry group @xmath217 for @xmath175 and @xmath218 for @xmath182 .",
    "let @xmath219 in the former case and @xmath220 in the latter case . then , choosing any holomorphic function @xmath131 related to the given function @xmath12 by ( [ eq : f - over - f ] ) , the integration formula @xmath221 holds true , provided that @xmath12 falls off sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "thus the superbosonization formula takes the same form as in the previous case @xmath21 , except that the exponent @xmath3 now is reduced to @xmath222 .",
    "the latter goes hand in hand with the size of the supermatrix @xmath88 having been expanded by @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "another remark is that the square root of the superdeterminant , @xmath225 is always analytic in the sector of the matrix @xmath84 . for the case of orthogonal symmetry",
    "this is because @xmath226 is isomorphic to the unitary skew - symmetric @xmath227 matrices and for such matrices the determinant has an analytic square root known as the pfaffian .",

    "then from @xmath259 we have the relation @xmath260 which transfers the euclidean norm of the vector space @xmath261 to a corresponding norm on @xmath262 . in view of the scaling implied by this transfer",

    "we emphasize that this really is just a local definition so far , as the presence of the square root factors may be an obstruction to the global existence of such a form .",
    "now focus on the case of @xmath127 . there ,",
    "restriction to the domains @xmath1456 and @xmath228 gives the differential forms @xmath1457 and @xmath1458 .",
    "both of these are globally defined .",
    "indeed , we can take the factor @xmath1459 in the first differential form to be the reciprocal of the positive square root of the positive hermitian matrix @xmath1460 , and the square root @xmath1461 appearing in the second form makes global sense as the pfaffian of the unitary skew - symmetric matrix @xmath1462 . reinterpreting these differential forms as densities we arrive at a @xmath1463-invariant measure on @xmath1456 and a @xmath208-invariant measure on @xmath228 : @xmath1464 again ,",
    "our normalization conventions for @xmath1465 are those of sect .",

    "the roles of @xmath1466 and @xmath1467 are reversed .",
    "this immediately leads to a good definition of @xmath1468 for the non - compact symmetric space @xmath1469 .",
    "however , the remaining case of @xmath1470 is problematic because there exists no global definition of @xmath1471 on the unitary symmetric matrices .",
    "thus the locally defined differential form @xmath1472 does _ not _ extend to a globally defined form on @xmath1473 .",
    "( please be advised that this is inevitable , as the compact symmetric space @xmath1474 lacks the property of orientability and on a non - orientable manifold any globally defined top - degree differential form must have at least one zero and therefore can not be both non - zero and invariant in the required sense . )    of course @xmath1475 still exists as a density on the non - orientable manifold @xmath1476 .",
    "the discussion above is just saying that there exists no globally defined differential form corresponding to @xmath1477 .",
