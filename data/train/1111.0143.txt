    "clusters of galaxies are the latest objects to form in the universe and represent the largest and most massive gravitationally bound systems , with radii of few mpc and total masses @xmath2 , of which galaxies , gas , and dark matter ( dm ) contribute roughly for 5@xmath3 , 15@xmath3 , and 80@xmath3 respectively ( see e.g.  @xcite for a general overview ) .",
    "+ clusters of galaxies are very complex astrophysical environments , where a significant amount of very high energy ( vhe , @xmath0  gev ) @xmath1-ray emission is expected on the following general grounds .",
    "( i ) clusters are actively evolving objects and they should dissipate energies of the order of the final gas binding energy through merger and accretion shocks as well as turbulences , which are also likely to accelerate non - thermal electrons and protons to high energies  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) clusters are home of different types of energetic outflows of powerful sources such as radio galaxies  @xcite and supernova - driven galactic winds  @xcite . ( iii ) clusters contain large amounts of gas with embedded magnetic fields often showing direct evidence for shocks and turbulence as well as relativistic particles  @xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , galaxy clusters are characterized by very large mass  to  light ratios and considerable dm overdensities , and hence they could be considered as interesting targets for the search of emissions in the @xmath1-ray regime from dm annihilation  @xcite or decay  @xcite . however , the recently underlined very extended nature of the dm signal in clusters  @xcite represents a major issue for the current generation of cherenkov telescopes .",
    "+ the perseus cluster , at a distance of 77.7  mpc ( z  =  0.018 ) , is the brightest x - ray cluster  @xcite , hosting a massive cooling flow and a luminous radio mini - halo that fills a large fraction of the cluster core region  @xcite .",
    "the radio mini - halo is well explained by the hadronic scenario where the radio emitting electrons are produced in hadronic cr proton - proton interactions with intra - cluster medium ( icm ) protons  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the perseus cluster hosts two very interesting objects , that have been recently detected at high energy ( he , @xmath4  mev  @xmath5  @xmath4  gev ) by _ fermi_lat , and at vhe by magic , namely the two radio galaxies ngc  1275 and ic  310 .",
    "+ ngc  1275 is the central galaxy of the perseus cluster and is of great interest due to its possible `` feed - back '' role in the cluster environment ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and for physics studies of relativistic outflows .",
    "its classification varies between different papers and catalogues , and the complex structure of ngc 1275 including surrounding filaments leads to a peculiar morphology classification  @xcite . +",
    "ic  310 is classified as head - tail radio galaxy , a type of active galactic nuclei only occuring in dense galaxy clusters  @xcite , like the perseus cluster . in 1999 , it was suggested that ic  310 could be a dim blazar because of the absence of strong emission lines and the spectral indices on radio and x - ray measurements  @xcite . later on it",
    "was also shown that the x - ray emission may originate from the central active galactic nucleus of a bl lac - type object  @xcite .",
    "the magic experiment consists of two 17  m dish imaging air cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) located on the canary island of la palma ( 2200  m a.s.l . ) .",
    "the magic telescopes are currently the largest existing iacts . since the end of 2009 the telescopes are working together in stereoscopic mode which ensures an excellent sensitivity of @xmath6 of crab nebula flux above @xmath7  gev in 50  hr of observations , and a trigger energy threshold of @xmath8  gev  @xcite .",
    "the angular and energy resolution at @xmath4  gev are @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the stereoscopic observations improved the sensitivity achieved with the single telescope observations by a factor of @xmath112 for energies above few hundreds of gev , and a factor @xmath113 for lower energies down to the threshold , which allows us to extend the observations carried out by the _ fermi_lat detector up to the tev scale and without energy gaps .",
    "+ the perseus galaxy cluster was carefully chosen over other nearby clusters as it is the most promising target for the detection of @xmath1-rays originating from the neutral pion decays result of the hadronic cosmic - rays ( cr ) interactions with the icm  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the central radio galaxy ngc  1275 is a very promising gev - tev target  @xcite .",
    "hence it represents _ per se _ a good reason for the observation of this cluster at vhe .",
    "+ the magic experiment conducted the deepest survey ever made at vhe of the perseus cluster , collecting data in both single telescope mode ( @xmath1125  hr of magic - i observations between november and december 2008 )  @xcite and stereoscopic mode ( @xmath1185  hr of observations between october 2009 and february 2011 )  @xcite .",
    "the source was observed in the false source tracking ( wobble ) mode  @xcite , with data equally split in different pointing positions located symmetrically at @xmath12 from ngc  1275 , in order to ensure optimum sky coverage and background estimate .",
    "the survey was carried out during dark time at low zenith angles ( from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) , which guaranteed the lowest energy threshold .",
    "the analysis of the data was performed using the standard magic software  @xcite , taking advantage ( for the stereoscopic data ) of newly developed analysis routines  @xcite .",
    "these observations resulted in the discovery of ic  310  @xcite and ngc  1275 ( atel@xmath152916 )  @xcite as vhe @xmath1-ray emitters , as shown in figure  [ skymap ] .",
