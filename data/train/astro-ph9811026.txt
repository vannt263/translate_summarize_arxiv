    "an important reason for the long - standing mysteries surrounding the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources has been the lack of prompt accurate locations to look for quiescent or fading counterparts .",
    "this situation changed dramatically in 1997 with the rapid and accurate location of x - ray emission detected during grbs using the wide - field camera on the satellite per astronomia x ( bepposax ) , the all sky monitor on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) , and from the detection of x - ray afterglow in scans of batse grb error boxes with the pca on _",
    "rxte_.    these localized x - ray counterparts have led to intense multiwavelength campaigns .",
    "optical transients have been found to some but not all of the bursts with fading x - ray counterparts .",
    "the reason optical transients have not been discovered for the other bursts with x - ray counterparts ( some of which are much brighter during the gamma - ray burst itself ) is that the searches have not always been sensitive enough , particularly given the problem of absorption local to the source ( groot et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in spite of detailed searches ,",
    "radio emission has only been detected for a few bursts .",
    "the first detection of a variable radio source was grb 970508 ( frail et al .",
    "@xcite ; taylor et al .",
    "@xcite ; galama et al .",
    "this @xmath5 mjy source had a _ rising _ spectral index , and its rapid radio variability was most likely caused by interstellar scintillation .",
    "the combined observations of grb 970508 showed that the peak of the spectrum was in the sub - millimeter region ( galama et al .",
    "@xcite ) with the radio , millimeter , and optical emission peaking days to weeks after the burst ( frail et al .",

    "even before any counterparts were found , two completely separate classes of models had suggested this would be the case : ( 1 ) cosmological fireball models ( e.g. paczyski & rhoads @xcite ; katz @xcite ; mszros & rees @xcite ) , and ( 2 ) compton scattering models ( e.g. liang et al .",
    "@xcite ; liang @xcite )",
    ".    for grb 970508 there are at least two breaks in the spectrum between @xmath6 and @xmath7 hz ( galama et al .",
    "@xcite ) making this a crucial region for the models . to obtain a complete picture of the nature of the burst counterparts ,",
    "it is clear that one needs to cover the entire spectrum , and sub - millimeter observations with a @xmath5 mjy sensitivity are needed .",
    "this is particularly important since the optical emission can be suppressed by local absorption , and the radio emission can be self absorbed as well as scrambled by interstellar scintillation ( walker @xcite ) , while `` clean '' observations ought to be possible at sub - millimeter wavelengths .    in this paper",
    "we discuss our ongoing program of target of opportunity observations using scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope . in ",
    "2 we discuss some of the technical features of scuba that make it well suited for performing counterpart searches . in  3 we present the results of our observations to date on grbs 970508 ( which was a limited trial run ) , 971214 , 980326 , 980329 , 980519 , and 980703 . in ",
    "4 we give a brief discussion .",
    "scuba is the new sub - millimeter continuum instrument for the james clerk maxwell telescope on mauna kea , hawaii ( for a review see holland et al .",
    "it uses two arrays of bolometers to simultaneously observe the same region of sky , @xmath8 in diameter .",
    "the arrays are optimized for operations at 850 and 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "fully sampled maps of the @xmath9 region can be made by `` jiggling '' the array .",
    "thus this mode is appropriate for mapping the better localized grb error boxes as well as those of the x - ray transients .",
    "this mode can also be used to look for extended quiescent counterparts .",
    "deeper photometry can be performed using just the central pixel of these arrays .",
    "there are also dedicated photometry pixels for 1100 , 1350 , and 2000 @xmath0 m observations ( that can not be used at the same time as the arrays ) .",
    "this photometry mode is appropriate for well localized radio or optical transients .",
    "scan mapping of larger grb error boxes using the 450:850 filters is also possible . while this mode is ideal for mapping the long thin grb error boxes that are obtained using triangulation between satellites , e.g. @xmath10 ( hurley et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the sensitivity is greatly reduced .",
    "given the rapid dissemination of candidate optical and radio transients , the photometry mode is the one that we use most often . in principle , the most sensitive measurements can be made at 1350 @xmath0 m , though the 850 @xmath0 m array has an advantage because the multiple bolometers permit a good sky noise subtraction . in photometry mode , for an integration time of 2 hours , we would expect to achieve an rms @xmath11 mjy at 1350 @xmath0 m , @xmath12 mjy at 850 @xmath0 m , and @xmath13 mjy at 450 @xmath0 m .",
    "the sensitivities depend significantly on the weather , particularly at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "the jiggle maps give an rms that is a factor @xmath14 times higher .",
    "as a limited trial run , a 30 minute scuba observation of grb 970508 was made on 1997 may 26 using the 1350 @xmath0 m photometry pixel .",
    "the weather conditions were very poor .",
    "no source was detected with an rms @xmath15 mjy .",

    "<S> we discuss the first results of our ongoing program of target of opportunity observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) using the scuba instrument on the james clerk maxwell telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we present the results for grb 970508 , 971214 , 980326 , 980329 , 980519 , and 980703 .    </S>",
    "<S> our most important result to date is the detection of a fading counterpart to grb 980329 at 850 @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> although it proved to be difficult to find the infrared counterpart to this burst , the sub - millimeter flux was relatively bright . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that intrinsically the brightness of this counterpart was very similar to grb 970508 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio through sub - millimeter spectrum of grb 980329 is well fit by a power law with index @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can not exclude a @xmath2 power law attenuated by synchrotron self - absorption . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath3 vla - scuba power law spectrum is definitely ruled out for grb 980703 , and possibly also for grb 980519 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can not rule out that part of the sub - millimeter flux from grb 980329 comes from a dusty star - forming galaxy at high redshift , such as the ones recently discovered by scuba . </S>",
    "<S> any quiescent dust contribution will be much larger at sub - millimeter than at radio wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> both a high redshift and large dust extinction would help explain the reddening of the counterpart to grb 980329 , and a redshift of @xmath4 has been suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the large intensity of this burst might then indicate that beaming is important .    </S>"
