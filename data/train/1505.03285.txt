    "in recent @xmath7 dynamical lattice simulations with the overlap dirac operator a large degeneracy of the spin @xmath2 @xmath0 and possibly @xmath1 mesons has been discovered upon removal of the lowest - lying eigenmodes of the dirac operator from the valence quark propagators @xcite .",
    "the correlators have demonstrated a clean exponential decay suggesting that the mesons survive this truncation .",
    "one expects a priori , that upon elimination of the quasi - zero modes of the dirac operator , the chiral symmetry should be restored , since the quark condensate of the vacuum is connected with the density of the quasi - zero modes via the banks - casher relation @xcite .",
    "however , it has turned out that not only degeneracy patterns from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 symmetries are observed , but a larger degeneracy that includes all possible chiral multiplets for @xmath2 mesons .",
    "this symmetry has been established to be @xmath10 that includes both the isospin rotations of quarks of given chirality as well as the rotations of chirality itself ( chiralspin rotations ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry is higher than the @xmath11 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian and should be consequently considered as an emergent symmetry that reflects the qcd dynamics in @xmath2 mesons without the quasi - zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "this symmetry implies the absence of the color - magnetic field in the system and might be interpreted as a manifestation of the dynamical qcd string .    in the present paper",
    "we study the isovector @xmath4 mesons upon the reduction of the lowest - lying eigenmodes from the overlap valence quark propagators .",
    "we obtain the same symmetry patterns as for @xmath2 mesons , which supports consequently the existence of the @xmath5 symmetry in @xmath6 mesons after the quasi - zero mode reduction .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in chapter [ chapter - chiral - parity ] we discuss the parity - chiral , chiralspin and @xmath5 multiplets for the tensor mesons and respective interpolators and our expectations for the truncation of the lowest - lying dirac eigenmodes . in chapter [ chapter - lattice - setup ]",
    "we describe the lattice technicalities .",
    "the results are presented in chapter [ chapter - results ] .",
    "conclusions are given in chapter [ conclusions ] .",
    "additional tables are provided in appendix [ chapter - appendix ] .",
    "we discuss the theoretical predictions for the tensor meson spectrum after low - mode removal , which come either from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 restorations refs .",
    "@xcite , or from the higher @xmath5 symmetry , refs .",
    "we also present interpolators with the respective symmetry transformation properties .         of @xmath14",
    "are given .",
    "each meson is denoted as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 isospin , @xmath17 total angular momentum , @xmath18 parity and @xmath19 charge conjugation .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath9 connections are denoted by red and blue lines , respectively .",
    "_ _ ]    in a situation , where the @xmath8 chiral symmetry is restored but no higher symmetry is present , only mesons within each parity - chiral multiplet @xmath21 must be degenerate .",
    "for instance , in @xmath22 the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states , which are related via @xmath20 should have the same mass is the shorthand notation for the axial part of the @xmath8 transformations . ] .",
    "if @xmath9 is restored as well , all four mesons in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 representations should be mass degenerate , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath11 restoration requires the following degeneracies meson in @xmath26 is here denoted as @xmath27 , to distinguish it from the @xmath23 meson in @xmath28 .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath29 meson , which in @xmath25 is denoted as @xmath30 to distinguish it from the @xmath29 in @xmath31 . ]",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33      one of the most interesting features of the parity - chiral group , fig .  1 , is , that two independent @xmath34 isovector , @xmath35 , and two independent @xmath34 isoscalar , @xmath36 , mesons must exist . they differ from each other by the content of left- and right - handed quarks and therefore by the chiral representation @xmath21 .",
    "they are not connected via a @xmath8 or @xmath9 transformation , so their masses should be different without additional symmetry constraints . if their masses are degenerate , then there is a symmetry connecting the states of eq .",
    "( [ states-1 ] ) with the states of eq .",
    "( [ states-2 ] ) .",
    "hence , in such a situation a larger symmetry than @xmath11 has to be present .",
    "this issue will be discussed in the next subsection .",
