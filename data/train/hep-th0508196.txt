    "nowadays , string field theory ( sft ) turns out to be one of promising candidates for the nonperturbative formulation of string theory .",
    "attractive features of sft  such as background independence and local gauge symmetry  enable us to explore the moduli space and classical ( or quantum ) dynamics of string theory . in particular , the dynamics of unstable d - brane systems have been extensively investigated in terms of open sft @xcite and all results obtained up to now support sen s conjecture @xcite .",
    "furthermore , analysis of several systems involving closed string tachyons also have been developing @xcite .    in recent few years , a class of analytic classical solutions of cubic sft ( csft ) @xcite",
    "have been extensively investigated @xcite-@xcite . the solutions",
    " _ universal solutions _ @xcite  are lorentz invariant , universal and conjectured to be candidates for the closed string vacuum where there are no open strings .",
    "each solution is labeled by a function @xmath0 which obeys ( i ) bpz invariance , ( ii ) midpoint constraint and ( iii ) hermiticity .",
    "therefore , classification of the solutions reduce to a problem of classification of the functions satisfying above three conditions .",
    "a key feature of the moduli space of the solutions is distributions of zeros of @xmath0 on the unit disk . in general , it is expected that when zeros are on the unit circle , a solution becomes nontrivial , while when all of them are inside unit disk , a solution is trivial and pure gauge .",
    "such feature of zeros was confirmed for particular cases @xcite and proved for the general case of even polynomial functions in a systematic way @xcite .    after removing trivial solutions from the space of @xmath0",
    ", there remain a lot of nontrivial solutions .",
    "if all of them correspond to unique closed string vacuum , they must be equivalent each other through gauge transformations .",
    "in fact , there are strong evidences @xcite that nontrivial solutions considered in @xcite are equivalent through the ` global ' part of the local gauge symmetry generated by @xmath1 .",
    "such result allows us to interpret tachyon condensation as a dynamical symmetry breaking concerned with the csft potential .    from these results ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether classification of the whole moduli space of universal solutions is possible . as mentioned before ,",
    "the subspace of solutions labeled by even polynomial functions can be analyzed systematically @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a case involving an odd part of @xmath0 is more complicated than the even case owing to the fact that the midpoint condition @xmath2 becomes nontrivial in such case .",
    "for such reason , the odd part have never been considered earlier .",
    "besides the problem of classification of the solution mentioned above , introducing an odd part of @xmath0 poses some questions to us .",
    "a decomposition of @xmath0 according to worldsheet parity is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 are even and odd parts of @xmath0 which satisfy @xmath5 respectively .",
    "an important fact is that ( [ gdecomposeintro ] ) yields a decomposition of the corresponding classical solution @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are _ twist _ usually , reverses an orientation of an open string according to @xmath9 . ]",
    "even and odd parts of the universal solution associated with @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "thus , inclusion of an odd part of @xmath0 yields an odd component of a classical solution .",
    "such case have never been considered in any attempts to find the closed string vacuum  level truncation in siegel gauge @xcite , vacuum string field theory @xcite and universal solutions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is because of the fact that the equation of motion with respect to @xmath10 is linear in @xmath10 owing to twist invariance of the csft action , and one can make a consistent truncation by setting @xmath10 zero @xcite .",
    "however , at least in general , it is an nontrivial question whether an nonzero twist odd part is arrowed .",
    "if a twist odd component can not be removed and has physical effects , such situation indicates existence of new classical vacuum without twist symmetry .",
    "of course , such vacuum contradicts the uniqueness of the closed string vacuum , which is a part of sen s conjecture .",
    "thus our questions are as follows : twist symmetry of csft can be violated by a twist odd part of the universal solutions ? does such vacuum exists ? is it different from the closed string vacuum ? in this paper , we would like to answer such questions by considering two parameter family of the solution defined by @xmath11 the answer is that all things expected in above questions _ never occur _ , since we can show that every solution defined in terms of ( [ gparamintro ] ) is equivalent to the twist even solution considered in @xcite through a certain field redefinition .",
    "thus whole story is consistent with twist even solutions obtained earlier , and one does not need to worry about violation of twist symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ twistreviewsec ] , after reviewing twist symmetry in csft , we introduce two parameter family of universal solutions which will be used throughout this paper .",
    "in particular , distribution of zeros of @xmath0 are investigated precisely . in following two sections",
    ", we give some evidences that the solutions can become nontrivial when some zeros reach unit circle .",
    "section [ seccohom ] deals with singularity of the field redefinition operator and brst cohomology of the modified brst operator . in section [ sec :",
    "level ] , we give level truncation analysis of the csft expanded around the classical solutions . in section [ sectwistproof ]",
    "we give a conformal transformation which completely maps our solutions to the twist even solution considered in @xcite . with the help of this map , twist symmetry of a csft around our solution",
    "can be easily understood and turns out to be unbroken .",
    "finally in section [ secconclu ] , we summarize our results and give some discussions .",
    "first let us summarize some aspects of csft concerned with the twist symmetry of open string theory .",
    "we shall borrow most notations and discussions from @xcite .",
    "the csft action @xcite on single unstable d-25 brane is given by @xmath12 = - \\frac{1}{g_{o}^{2 } } \\left (   \\frac{1}{2 } { \\left<\\psi ,   q_b \\psi\\right > }   + \\frac{1}{3 } { \\left<\\psi , \\psi , \\psi \\right > }    \\right ) ,    \\label{sftaction}\\ ] ] where the braket @xmath13 is the multi string product defined by the noncommutative star products @xcite .",
    "open string theory has the twist symmetry @xmath14 which reverses an orientation of an open string worldsheet .",
    "the action of twist symmetry on the open string hilbert space is quite simple in the oscillator formalism . for an oscillator satisfying @xmath15 = n \\phi_n$ ] , @xmath16 note that the @xmath17 vacuum @xmath18 has twist eigenvalue @xmath19 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore we have , for example , @xmath20 since the string field can be represented by a linear combination of fock space states , ( [ twistonbase ] ) defines the action of @xmath14 on the string field . in the language of csft",
    ", the twist symmetry of correlation functions of cft is conveniently expressed as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are arbitrary string fields . applying ( [ twiston2 ] ) and ( [ twiston3 ] ) to ( [ sftaction ] ) , and taking into account the facts that @xmath25 is grassmann odd and @xmath26=0 $ ] , we can show the twist invariance of csft action , @xmath27 = s[\\psi ] .",
    "\\label{twistsymmetry}\\ ] ] in the following , we only consider a case in which @xmath25 belongs to the universal subspace @xcite which consists of the matter virasoro generators , conformal ghost oscillators and the @xmath28 vacuum .",
    "decompose @xmath25 as @xmath29 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are string fields with twist eigenvalues @xmath30 and @xmath19 , respectively . plugging ( [ twistdecompose ] ) into ( [ sftaction ] ) and using ( [ twistsymmetry ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath31 = \\frac{1}{2 } { \\left<\\psi_{+ } ,   q_b \\psi_{+}\\right > }     + \\frac{1}{3 }   { \\left<\\psi_{+ } , \\psi_{+ } , \\psi_{+ } \\right > } \\\\ + \\frac{1}{2 } { \\left<\\psi_{- } ,   q_b \\psi_{-}\\right > }     + { \\left<\\psi_{+ } , \\psi_{- } , \\psi_{- } \\right>}. \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] equations of motion with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath32 respectively .",
    "since ( [ oddeom ] ) is linear in @xmath8 , one can make a consistent truncation to set @xmath8 zero as proposed in @xcite .",
    "however one can also find a solution with nonzero @xmath8 . in the following",
    ", we would like to argue such case .      in the formalism of universal solution @xcite , which is exact classical solutions of csft outside siegel gauge @xcite , it is easy to construct solutions with twist odd string fields .",
    "the solution is labeled by a function @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the identity string field . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are integrals of the brst current and conformal ghost @xmath38 multiplied by each functions over the left half of an open string . to satisfy the equation of motion , the function @xmath33 must obey @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the hermiticity condition which will be discussed later .",
    "decompose @xmath33 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are even and odd functions of @xmath44 respectively . using ( [ solform ] )",
    ", one can easily confirm that setting @xmath45 adds twist odd components to ( [ solform ] ) .    in the rest part of this paper",
    ", we shall analyze the modified brst operator obtained by fluctuating a string field around the solution ( [ solform ] ) .",
    "such operator is defined by @xmath46 , and explicitly given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are defined in the same manner as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , but integrals are now taken over the whole unit circle .",
    "again , the odd part of @xmath0 corresponds to the contribution of twist odd components of the solution .    in terms of @xmath0 ,",
    "the conditions imposed on @xmath33 are expressed as @xcite , @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 in particular , the third condition  positivity of @xmath0 on the unit circle  ensures hermiticity of the modified brst operator .      as a simple example of a solution including twist odd components",
    ", we shall consider @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are real parameters . with this choice , two of the three conditions imposed on @xmath0 , ( [ idg ] ) and ( [ midg ] ) ,",
    "are trivially satisfied . on the other hand",
    ", the condition ( [ hermg ] ) will further restrict parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 to be in certain region .",
    "to impose ( [ hermg ] ) on ( [ g2parm ] ) , another parameterization of @xmath59 in term of its zeros is quite useful .",
    "such parameterization also have been played an important role in the analysis of the universal solutions @xcite . among six zeros of ( [ g2parm ] ) ,",
    "three zeros are always inside the unit disk , while the rest are outside owing to the symmetry ( [ idg ] ) .",
    "when ( [ hermg ] ) is satisfied , one of three zeros inside the unit disk becomes pure imaginary , and other two are symmetric under @xmath60 .",
    "we denote the pure imaginary zero as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is real , and the pair of complex zeros as @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in terms of these zeros , we can rewrite ( [ g2parm ] ) as @xmath65 where @xmath66 it can be easily seen that ( [ gbyzeros ] ) satisfies ( [ idg ] ) , ( [ hermg ] ) and @xmath67 , but does _ not _ obeys @xmath68 in general .",
    "of course , the last condition is necessary ) to two , which is the same number of parameters contained in ( [ g2parm ] ) . ] . imposing @xmath68 on ( [ gbyzeros ] ) gives @xmath69 this constraint means that @xmath63 is on a circle with radius @xmath70 and center @xmath71 .",
    "such @xmath63 can be parameterized as @xmath72 imposing @xmath73 on ( [ xparamintth ] ) gives @xmath74 for simplicity , consider a case where @xmath62 is positive case can be obtained by reversing all zeros in positive case by @xmath75 . ] . for fixed @xmath62 ,",
    "the complex zeros moves inside lower half of the unit disk along the circle defined by ( [ xparamintth ] ) .",
    "in particular ,    * we exclude @xmath76 case , because in this case the laurent coefficients of ( [ gbyzeros ] ) diverge , therefore @xmath0 no longer gives an well - defined brst operator . *",
    "the complex zeros reach to the unit circle when @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pure imaginary zero is always inside the unit disk because @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the distribution of zeros is completely specified by the two parameter family of pure imaginary and complex zeros given by ( [ xparamintth ] ) within the range of parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "our conjecture in this and next section is that the classical solution given by ( [ gbyzeros ] ) becomes nontrivial if and only if the complex zeros ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) reach to the unit circle . using analytic methods",
    ", we will give two evidences for our conjecture .",
    "further evidence from numerical analysis will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : level ] .",
    "first evidence for our conjecture can be obtained by an analysis of field redefinitions associated with the modified brst operator . in the same manner as in @xcite",
    ", the modified brst operator can be formally transformed to @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the ghost number current . when the operator @xmath87 is regular , ( [ qbtrans ] ) defines well - defined transformation",
    "; we can transform the csft action with @xmath88 into the original action with @xmath81 by a field redefinition @xmath89 . in such case",
    ", a classical solution has no physical meaning and corresponds to gauge degree of freedom .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath87 happens to be singular , we can not perform such field redefinition . in such case",
    "a solution is expected to be nontrivial .    in order to evaluate such singularity",
    ", we shall use an oscillator expansion of @xmath84 .",
    "we can obtain this using ( [ gbyzeros ] ) and ( [ gxdef ] ) and the fact that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the result is @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the oscillator mode of @xmath86 . using ( [ qhdef ] )",
    ", we can evaluate the singularity of @xmath87 by performing normal ordering with respect to the @xmath28 vacuum . a calculation",
    "is easily performed by using @xmath95=n \\delta_{n+m}$ ] , and it turns out that a contraction of two zeros @xmath96 and @xmath97 contributes a factor @xmath98 .",
    "a potentially divergent factor comes from a contraction between @xmath63 and @xmath64 parts in @xmath84 and it amounts to @xmath99 in fact , it diverges when @xmath63 reaches to the unit circle .",
    "thus , in this case , the classical solution is expected to be nontrivial , since csft action with @xmath88 no longer equivalent to the original action .      as a further evidence for our conjecture",
    ", we shall show that the cohomology of the modified brst operator vanishes when complex zeros come to unit circle .",
    "this means no physical excitation of open string around the solution .",
    "such result is expected according to to sen s conjecture , if our nontrivial solutions correspond to the closed string vacuum .",
    "the proof can be done in a way similar to @xcite , where the cohomology of the brst operator is mapped to the modified kato - ogawa cohomology @xcite with ` wrong ' ghost numbers .    for a critical configuration satisfying @xmath100 and @xmath101 , ( [ gbyzeros ] )",
    "becomes @xmath102 a crucial step is rewriting ( [ gcritical ] ) to @xmath103 where @xmath104 next , using the formula @xmath105 @xcite , we can rewrite ( [ qfac ] ) into corresponding operator equation , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the ` shifted ' brst operator obtained by applying a replacement @xmath108 to @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "note that the transformations in ( [ cohotrans ] ) is regular , because @xmath109 and @xmath110 consists of only negative frequency modes of the ghost number current .",
    "the cohomology of @xmath111 obtained in @xcite mapped into that of @xmath88 as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the ddf states @xcite .",
    "since a ghost number of this state is not equal to unity , the state is actually zero in the context of classical csft without gauge fixing .",
    "thus we have obtained a vanishing cohomology .",
    "one the other hand , for trivial solutions whose all zeros are inside the unit disk , it is easily shown that the brst cohomology is equivalent to the kato - ogawa cohomology which appearers in ( [ qbtrans ] ) . ] .",
    "therefore , our result implies that the solutions with complex zeros on the unit circle are nontrivial one corresponding to the closed string vacuum .",
    "as another nontrivial test for our proposal , we can perform the level truncation analysis of the csft around the classical solutions .",
    "an analysis can be done in almost same manner as @xcite , except for the fact that we must include string fields of odd levels . in siegel gauge ,",
    "the ` normalized ' csft potential around the classical solution becomes @xmath115 for the representation of @xmath0 given in ( [ g2parm ] ) , the gauge fixed kinetic operator @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the @xmath119 twisted virasoro generator and @xmath120 is a real valued integral defined by @xmath121 following @xcite , let us consider a local minimum of the potential . as explained in @xcite ,",
    "if our solution correctly reproduce the d - brane tension and obeys sen s conjecture , then the value of the potential at local minimum should depends on the positions of complex zeros as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the local minimum . according to ( [ delta ] ) , a plot of @xmath124 with respect to parameters of @xmath0 is expected to have discontinuities when @xmath125 . of course",
    ", an actual plot obtained by level truncation will never coincide with ( [ delta ] ) exactly , though it will approach ( [ delta ] ) as level increases .",
    "the only difference between our analysis and @xcite is inclusion of odd level fields .",
    "this is necessary for our case since the potential ( [ univpot ] ) is no longer invariant under @xmath14 because @xmath116 does not commutes with @xmath14 in general .",
    "the gauge fixed equations of motion obtained from ( [ univpot ] ) become @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are twist even and odd parts of ( [ kinticop ] ) , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath8 can not be set to zero to satisfy ( [ leveleomodd ] ) because of the presence of the odd part of the kinetic operator .",
    "now we shall try to find a level truncated solution of ( [ leveleomeven ] ) and ( [ leveleomodd ] ) in the universal subspace @xcite .",
    "actual calculation is done as follows :    * required techniques to perform level truncation analysis have already developed by many authors , and they can also be applied for our case . to compute three string vertex , we use the conservation current method and an algorithm used in @xcite .",
    "* we can easily see that there are no level 1 fields in siegel gauge .",
    "odd fields appearers first at level 3 . that is given by , @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are real parameters .",
    "* we have done all computations up to level ( 6 , 18 ) .",
    "since our solution has two independent parameters , we must fix one of them to draw a two dimensional plot of potential values .",
    "we will do this in two different ways .      as first example of one parameter solution , we set @xmath133 in ( [ g2parm ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath134 the condition ( [ hermg ] ) determines the range of @xmath57 as @xmath135 two boundaries of the above region correspond to critical points where the complex zeros are on the unit circle .",
    "positions of zeros at two critical points are given by @xmath136 according to ( [ delta ] ) , the potential value will depend on @xmath57 as @xmath137 using ( [ goriginal ] ) , we can compute the value of the potential at a local minimum @xmath138 as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ potentialplot ] is a plot of our result up to level 6 .",
    "we can see that a flat region at the bottom glows , and two flat regions at both sides shrink as level increases .",
    "surely curves approach the discontinuous configuration predicted in ( [ deltaa ] ) .",
    "in addition , we can see that level 3 fields  first odd fields  surely contribute to the potential value and improve level 2 result .",
    "table [ fieldtbl ] picks up values of some fields at a local minimum in the case of @xmath139 .",
    "@xmath62 is the level 0 field , and @xmath130 and @xmath132 are level 3 fields appeared in ( [ level3 ] ) .",

    "this fact can be easily confirmed by mapping the twist operator @xmath14 to new one .",

    "furthermore , it was shown that the brst cohomology of the kinetic operator of csft expanded around the nontrivial solution is equivalent to that of the twist even solution given in @xcite .",
    "also we have performed level truncation analysis using the csft potential obtained by expanding original csft action around our solutions .",
    "our plots of the value of the csft potential with respect to positions of the complex zeros indicate that our solutions are consistent with sen s conjecture and nontrivial solutions correspond to the closed string vacuum .",
    "finally , we have shown that our nontrivial solutions are equivalent to the twist even solutions found in @xcite by constructing a conformal map which connects brst operators associated with each solution . with the help of this map ,",
    "the twist operator of csft expanded around our solutions was obtained from ordinary twist operator @xmath14 .",
    "thus , our result suggests that the twist symmetry is unbroken even for our solutions which contain twist odd modes , and supports the uniqueness of the closed string vacuum .    while our analysis is done in the classical csft where no gauge fixing condition is imposed",
    ", it is interesting to consider same situation as ours , i.e. , classical solutions involving twist odd modes in the csft in siegel gauge .",
    "we have found that there are no twist odd excitations which reproduce the value of the potential close to the d-25 brane tension , at least up to level 3",
    ". it would be nice if there is general arguments whether nonzero values of twist odd fields are possible .",
    "it is also interesting to consider more general solutions than the case considered in this paper .",
    "if we limit ourself to the polynomial case , a typical form of the function @xmath0 will be @xmath193 the most crucial point is to specify the distribution of zeros under three conditions imposed on @xmath0 . if this becomes clear , it is straightforward to classify all solutions in this class .",
    "our results and earlier works @xcite-@xcite are enough to expect that all nontrivial solutions belong to the class of ( [ generalansatz ] ) are equivalent , thus correspond to the unique solution i.e. , closed string vacuum",
    ". such consideration of the moduli space of sft will give us deep insights into the nature of sft and string theory .",
