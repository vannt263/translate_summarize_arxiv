    "irrotational dust spacetimes are typically considered as models for the late universe or for gravitational collapse .",
    "they are covariantly characterized by the dust four - velocity @xmath2 , energy density @xmath3 , expansion @xmath4 , and shear @xmath5 , and by the free gravitational field , described by the electric and magnetic parts of the weyl tensor @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spatial projection of the spacetime permutation tensor @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the projected , symmetric and trace - free part of @xmath11 with @xmath12 the spatial projector into the comoving rest space , and @xmath13 the spacetime metric .",
    "gravitational radiation is covariantly described by the nonlocal fields @xmath14 , the tidal part of the curvature which generalizes the newtonian tidal tensor , and by @xmath15 , which has no newtonian analogue  @xcite . as such ,",
    "@xmath15 may be considered as the true gravity wave tensor , since there is no gravitational radiation in newtonian theory .",
    "however at least in the linear regime , as in electromagnetic theory , gravity waves are characterized by @xmath15 and @xmath14 , where both are divergence - free but neither is curl - free @xcite . here the covariant spatial divergence and curl for tensors are defined by @xcite :    @xmath16 where the spatial part @xmath17 of the covariant derivative @xmath18 is given by @xmath19    for this reason spacetimes in which @xmath20 have been termed _",
    "purely radiative _  @xcite .",
    "although , when considering the gravitational dynamics of matter in the full non - linear regime , these conditions give rise to two independent chains of rather severe integrability conditions , it was remarked in @xcite that both are satisfied by the bianchi class a solutions and hence purely radiative solutions at least can exist .",
    "we turn the argument around and show that , within the family of irrotational dust spacetimes for which @xmath20 , the bianchi class a spatially homogeneous dust models are uniquely characterised by the condition that h is diagonal in the common shear and e - eigenframe .",
    "the existence of the latter eigenframe is guaranteed by the bianchi identity ( [ bianchi3 ] ) below , @xmath21_a=0,\\ ] ] where the spatial dual of the commutator of tensors , @xmath22_a$ ] , is defined as @xmath22_a=\\varepsilon_{abc}s^{bd}{t_d}^c$ ] .",
    "we follow the notations and conventions of the ellis - maccallum orthonormal tetrad formalism  @xcite . herein , the normalized 4-velocity @xmath2 plays the role of the timelike basis vectorfield @xmath23 of the tetrad @xmath24 .",
    "greek indices take the values 1 , 2 and 3 and refer to tetrad components with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "the basic variables in this formalism are 24 independent linear combinations of the ricci rotation coefficients or , equivalently , of the commutator coefficients @xmath26 associated with the tetrad ; these are the objects @xmath27 and @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 , the components @xmath30 of the angular velocity of the triad @xmath31 with respect to the local ` inertial compass ' and the components @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the spatial kinematic quantities ( acceleration vector , vorticity vector and expansion tensor respectively ) .",
    "we also use the decomposition @xmath35 , with @xmath5 the trace - free shear tensor and @xmath4 the expansion scalar .",
    "it turns out that there is a slight notational advantage in using instead of the variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 the connection coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 related to the former by @xmath41 ( these expressions have to be read modulo 3 , so for example @xmath42 gives @xmath43 ) . for sake of simplicity",
    "we define @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the spatial gradients of @xmath4 and @xmath3 respectively : @xmath46 , @xmath47 .    together with the jacobi identities and the @xmath48 field equations @xcite , the basic equations in the formalism are the ricci equations for @xmath49 and the bianchi equations@xcite , which for @xmath50 simplify to the following :      @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54      @xmath55    @xmath56_a+\\frac{1}{3}d_a\\rho,\\ ] ]    @xmath57_a,\\ ] ]    @xmath58    @xmath59    as we are working in the @xmath60-eigenframe we derive from ( [ ricci3 ] ) with @xmath61 that , @xmath62 as a consequence the angular velocity @xmath63 can be assumed to be 0 : either all components automatically vanish , or , when e.g.  the @xmath64 plane is a shear eigen - plane , then @xmath65 and we can choose an extra rotation in this plane to make @xmath66 .",
    "the frame is then fixed up to rotations in the @xmath64-plane for which the rotation angle @xmath67 satisfies @xmath68 .    from the diagonal components of ( [ ricci2 ] ) we obtain the following algebraic relations between @xmath69,@xmath70 and @xmath71 : @xmath72 from the definition of @xmath73 and the assumption of @xmath74 we have @xmath75",
    "while the bianchi equation ( [ bianchi2 ] ) yields @xmath76 from ( [ ricci1 ] ) we can derive the spatial derivatives of @xmath70 @xmath77 note that we can assume that the shear is non - zero , as otherwise solutions would be conformally flat and we have a frw universe .",
    "we now act with the commutator @xmath78 $ ] on @xmath3 to obtain the relation @xmath79 after which the time evolution of ( [ bianchi22 ] ) results in @xmath80    provided we assume that also @xmath81 is diagonal in the @xmath82-eigenframe , it follows directly from ( [ bianchi22 ] ) and ( [ hdot ] ) that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , suggesting that the corresponding spacetimes _ might _ be spatially homogeneous .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath78 \\equiv -(\\sigma_{\\alpha\\alpha}+\\frac{1}{3}\\theta)\\partial_{\\alpha}$ ] we obtain from ( [ ricci4 ] ) and @xmath85 that @xmath86 and hence , using ( [ ricci2 ] ) and ( [ dsigma ] ) ,    @xmath87    we will treat the two cases of non - degenerate shear and degenerate shear now separately .",
    "propagating the last three equations along the fluid flow we get @xmath88 where @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 -(\\sigma_{11}-\\sigma_{22})(\\sigma_{22}-\\sigma_{33})(\\sigma_{33}-\\sigma_{11 } ) .\\]]if @xmath91 it would follow from ( [ rq2 ] ) that @xmath92 , after which @xmath93 leads to the contradiction @xmath94 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath95 and , according to ( [ rq1 ] ) , we find that @xmath96 , such that @xmath97 and @xmath98 is diagonal .",
    "it is easy to check that all spatial derivatives of the rotation coefficients now vanish and , as the frame is invariantly defined , we obtain the non - degenerate spatially homogenous models of * bianchi class a * ( i.e.  types @xmath99 ) .",
    "from the degeneracy of the shear it is easily verified that @xmath100 must be degenerate too ; so we can assume @xmath101    assuming that @xmath81 is diagonal in the @xmath60-eigenframe , ( [ rq1 ] ) implies    @xmath102    while the ( 23 ) component of ( [ ricci2 ] ) shows that @xmath103 and hence @xmath104 .    at this point",
    "the only variables having possibly non - vanishing spatial derivatives are @xmath105 and @xmath106 . eliminating @xmath107 from([bianchi4 ] ) for @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    ", we obtain the following equation @xmath110 in combination with ( [ ricci21 ] ) the latter leads to @xmath111 we will discuss the three cases that follow from ( [ vwn ] ) separately ; i.e.  @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . note that in the ensuing classification @xmath115 is nowhere zero , due to the non - existence of so - called anti - newtonian universes @xcite      in this case @xmath117 , according to ( [ vwn ] ) . propagating along @xmath118 gives @xmath119and thus @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "applying @xmath122 $ ] to @xmath123 , gives us @xmath124 and hence @xmath125 , the @xmath126 derivative of which results in @xmath127 .",
    "so @xmath128 and @xmath129 all become zero and we have @xmath130this implies the vanishing of the spatial derivatives of all rotation coefficients(@xmath131 ) and we obtain a spatially homogeneous universe of * bianchi class a , type @xmath132*.      first notice that a rotation about an angle @xmath67 exists such that @xmath134 , @xmath125 and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 this requires the existence of a solution @xmath67 of the system @xmath137 the integrability conditions of which are identically satisfied ( the first equation of ( [ rot1 ] ) guarantees that @xmath138 remains zero ) .    note that the system ( [ rot1 ] ) can only give us a solution when @xmath139 . in that case",
    "we obtain @xmath140 , \\quad a_{\\alpha } = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ \\sqrt{-k}/2\\\\0\\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] and we have a lrs spacetime with    1 .   * @xmath141 : bianchi class a , type @xmath142 * , 2",
    ".   * @xmath143 : * when we look at the ellis - maccallum quantity @xcite @xmath144 , we find @xmath145 and hence this class is equivalent with * bianchi class a , type @xmath146*.    when @xmath147 ( [ rot1 ] ) has no solution , but now we can look for another rotation @xmath67 to make @xmath97 .",
    "this requires the existence of a solution @xmath67 of the system @xmath148 again the integrability conditions are identically satisfied and we find @xmath149 leading to the lrs * bianchi class a , type @xmath150 * models .",
    "these models are exceptional in the sense that they are ` purely electric ' @xmath151 .    as in ( 4.2 )",
    "one shows that a rotation exists under which @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 become zero , where @xmath155 is the same quantity as defined by ( [ k ] ) .    when @xmath156 , we now obtain @xmath157 , \\quad a_{\\alpha } = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\ \\sqrt{-k}/2\\\\0\\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ]    which is a lrs spatially homogenous * bianchi class b , type @xmath158 * model and which is pseudo - spherically symmetric @xcite .    when @xmath159 , then @xmath127 and we have @xmath97 , @xmath160 , which is a lrs spatially homogenous * bianchi class a , type @xmath161 * model ( equivalent to * bianchi class a , type @xmath162 * @xcite ) .",
    "a problem arises when @xmath147 : @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath163 can still be made zero by a rotation , but it is no longer possible to choose a frame in which all spatial derivatives identically vanish .",
    "however the cartan equations can now be integrated immediately and one finds the metric @xmath164.\\ ] ] the resulting models are the kantowski - sachs universes , which , as is well known , do not admit a @xmath165-dimensional isometry group acting simply transitively on the @xmath166 hypersurfaces .",
    "we have shown that the bianchi class a dust models can be uniquely characterised as irrotational dust spacetimes which are purely radiative in the sense that the gravitational field satisfies @xmath167 under the assumption that also the magnetic part of the weyl tensor @xmath81 is diagonal in the shear - electric eigenframe ( and hence @xmath168=0 $ ] ) .",
    "the only possible exception arises for degenerate shear and @xmath169 : when @xmath170 or @xmath156 , in which case solutions are given respectively by the kantowski - sachs universes , or by the pseudo - spherically symmetric solutions of bianchi class @xmath158 .",
    "these models however are ` purely electric ' and can not be called ` purely radiative ' in a strict sense .",
    "the whole analysis presented here can be easily generalized to give a characterisation of spatially homogenous non - rotating _ perfect fluids _ of bianchi class a ( to be submitted ) . the next logical step is to investigate the case where @xmath168\\neq 0 $ ] : it is hoped that new classes of cosmologically interesting solutions will turn up .",
    "alternatively one would obtain the remarkable result that the bianchi class a spacetimes are the unique purely radiative ones ( work still in progress ) .",
