    "note that here in the cv setting , the quantum state can acquire any phase , in contrast to the discrete value for anyons in qubit systems with the analogous braiding operation ( where @xmath83 for qubits ) .",
    "the corresponding phase factors , changing the phase of the wavefunction , constitute an abelian ( commutative ) representation of the braid group .",
    "it is important to understand that , in general , a relation as described by eq.([phase ] ) can be obtained for different paths of the loop . for instance , the loop 1 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 4 of @xmath38-type anyons ( fig.1 g ) , which corresponds to the application of @xmath84[x_{3}(-t)x_{5}(-t)x_{6}(-t)x_{7}(-t)]$ ] , involving two star operators , gives the same result for the topological phase as in eq.([phase ] ) .",
    "in fact , this equivalence reflects the topological character of the extra phase factor and the potential robustness of the corresponding state transformation , as it is exploited in topological approaches to fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "in order to detect the most significant feature of anyons , their non - trivial statistical phase obtainable through braiding , we may employ an `` interference measurement '' in phase space , which enables us to detect the otherwise invisible global phase factor of eq.([phase ] ) .",

    "then we perform a closed loop of anyon @xmath38 around @xmath40 .",
    "finally , application of the inverse squeezing operation @xmath87 $ ] makes the phase difference visible , leading to the state @xmath88 according to @xmath89 this compares to the state @xmath90 without a closed loop of anyon @xmath38 around @xmath40 . in other words ,",
    "the effect of the braiding operation can be measured via the different stabilizer operators or , more precisely , the different position - momentum linear combination operators of the output states : for the relevant star operator @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 with braiding and @xmath93 without braiding .    note that this verification scheme is only complete , provided that , in addition to detecting the change of the stabilizer ( nullifier ) operator @xmath94 , a sufficient set of extra nullifiers @xmath68 and @xmath69 is measured in order to confirm the full inseparability of the output states ( the ground state and the momentum - displaced ground state ) @xcite . otherwise ,",
    "even a fully separable product state of zero - momentum eigenstates used as `` ground state '' could produce the same braiding statistics , as it would satisfy @xmath93 without braiding and @xmath92 with a `` closed braiding loop '' .",
    "such a trivial ground state , however , would obviously not simulate kitaev s surface code model ; in particular , apart from not satisfying the complete set of ground - state correlations , it would not allow for a verification of excited @xmath38-particles or the `` conjugate '' braiding operation of moving @xmath40 around @xmath38 .",

    "in a real experiment , because of finite squeezing , it is impossible to create perfect correlations in terms of position - momentum linear combination operators ( the stabilizers or , better , nullifiers ) for the anyonic ground state @xmath53 . nonetheless , we may still implement and detect anyonic fractional statistics by interpreting the presence of small fluctuations around the ground - state stabilizer conditions due to finite squeezing , without the existence of any first - moment phase - space translations , as the ground state ( fig .",
    "2d ) ; sufficiently large first - moment position ( or momentum ) translations , still maintaining the second - moment multi - mode position - momentum correlations , would then correspond to the excited states .    for verification , the amplitude ( phase ) quadrature ,",

    "one can determine first and second moments of the position - momentum linear combination operators for the anyonic ground and excited states .",
    "thus , the fully inseparable ground states can be verified and discriminated from the ( for large squeezing near - orthogonal ) excited ( displaced ground ) states @xcite ; at the same time enabling one to confirm the braiding - dependent state transition according to eq.([phase2])(see fig.2d ) . for finite , even small squeezing values ,",
    "it is still possible to discriminate the ground and excited states , provided the amplitude ( or phase ) translations are sufficiently large .",
    "higher squeezing values improve the sensitivity for detecting the amplitude ( or phase ) translations of the excited states . note that even for zero - squeezing resources , such a state discrimination can be almost perfect ( for large amplitudes / phases ) ; in this case , more subtle is the verification of the full inseparability @xcite of both the ground and excited states , as the multi - party entanglement in the approximate cv surface - code model would decrease in this case ( but it would not entirely vanish , because of the intrinsic squeezing of the @xmath43 gates for cv graph - state generation ) .    in the kitaev lattice model , the quasiparticles are particularly well localized : an @xmath40-particle is on a single star and",

    "the four - photon experiment relies upon only four photonic qubits entangled in a four - party ghz state .",
    "this simple system is sufficient for demonstrating a small kitaev lattice ( with one star and four plaquettes ) and a non - trivial braiding operation , because the remaining eight qubits of the total 12-qubit system factor out from the four - qubit ghz state in a fully separable product state @xcite . in the cv regime",
    ", we propose to pursue an analogous strategy .",
    "in fact , four - mode entangled cv ghz and cluster states have been demonstrated already experimentally @xcite . in a small - scale surface - code experiment , it is crucial to verify the full inseparability of the ghz - type ground state as well as that of the excited state , i.e. , a displaced ghz state .",
    "these simple systems may then also be used to implement and detect minimal braiding loops ( fig .",
    "2a , b , c ) with four - mode entangled ghz states .",
    "the complete verification requires detecting the position - momentum linear combinations corresponding to the stabilizer set @xmath97 including first and second moments @xcite .",
    "however , for the simple four - mode ghz states , there is no way to show the robustness of the topological braiding operation when the anyons are moved along different paths . in order to demonstrate such robustness of the anyon operations against different braiding paths ,",
    "more modes would be needed , for instance , nine - mode states in analogy to the nine - qubit states of ref.@xcite .",

    "there are several different loops for the quasiparticles .",
    "the anyonic statistics , however , would only depend on the topological character of the loop .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a protocol to create , manipulate , and detect anyonic states , including demonstration of their fusion rules and their fractional statistics , in the regime of continuous quantum variables . in our continuous - variable approach",
    "to kitaev s surface code model , the main features of anyons can be obtained via simple gaussian operations starting from the creation of suitable continuous - variable graph states . with regard to a potential optical realization",
    ", this means that all ingredients for a full verification can be implemented in a very efficient way : graph - state generation only requires off - line squeezing and linear optics ; the surface - code ground states are then obtained either through homodyne measurements or via local phase rotations ; anyon creation and braiding - dependent state transitions can be also detected through gaussian operations , i.e. , online squeezing transformations ( which could be shifted off - line @xcite ) and homodyne detections ( including first and second moments of quadrature combinations in order to verify the fully inseparable ground and excited states and to discriminate them against each other ) .",
    "this work is a first step towards further theoretical investigations of topological quantum computation over continuous variables and experimental proof - of - principle demonstrations of anyonic , topological features via relatively simple , stable optical systems , as opposed to the more traditional approaches within condensed matter physics .",
