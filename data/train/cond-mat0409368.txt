    "the evolution from bcs to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) superconductivity / superfluidity has attracted considerable amount of interest in the condensed matter  @xcite and atomic physics  @xcite communities . in the atomic physics community , this interest resulted from the possibility of studying condensation phenomena in fermionic atomic gases , where the scattering length ( and , thus , the effective interaction strength ) can be tunned via feshbach resonances for a given density  @xcite . in the condensed matter physics community , the interest in the bcs to bec evolution arouse in the context of high-@xmath1 superconductivity  @xcite , where the nature of the superconducting and normal states changes as function of carrier concentration .",
    "furthermore , experimentalists seem to start having some control over the carrier concentration using electronic doping via ferroelectric oxides  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental issue that needs to be addressed is whether there is a quantum phase transition in the evolution from a bcs to bec ground state , as particle density or scattering length ( interaction strength ) are varied . in this paper",
    "we show that for a two - dimensional @xmath0-wave superconductor there is a lifshitz transition between the bcs and bec ground states .",
    "the transition is second order according to ehrenfest s classification of phase transitions , but it occurs without change in symmetry as landau s classification would demand .",
    "the quantum phase transition found has a logarithmic singularity in the compressibility at a critical concentration for fixed interaction .",
    "furthermore , near the critical point the low temperature superfluid density exhibits a dramatic change in behavior .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the hamiltonian and the interparticle potential used in our model . in section iii , our functional integral calculation is presented , and the order parameter and number equations are derived at the mean - field level .",
    "the analysis of gaussian fluctuations about the saddle point solution is also performed in this section . in section iv ,",
    "our results for the electronic compressibility and the phase diagram of the system are shown , while in section v an analogy with the lifshitz transition in metals is discussed .",
    "the superfluid density is analyzed in section vi and , finally , our concluding remarks are summarized in section vii .",
