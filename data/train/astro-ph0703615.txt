    "the rate at which a bar rotates , its pattern speed , @xmath0 , is the principle parameter controlling a barred ( sb ) galaxy s dynamics and morphology .",
    "most determinations of this parameter are indirect .",
    "an often used method is to match hydrodynamical simulations of sb galaxies to observed velocity fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent examples ) .",
    "another commonly used method is to identify morphological features , such as rings , with resonance radii to infer the pattern speed .",
    "the only direct and model - independent technique to measure @xmath0 is the tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 , hereafter tw ) method .",
    "they show that if a tracer satisfies the continuity equation then it is straightforward to derive an expression that relates @xmath0 to the luminosity - weighted mean velocity , @xmath1 , and the luminosity - weighted mean position , @xmath2 , of this tracer .",
    "gas is generally not a suitable tracer because it is easily shocked , changes states or is converted into stars ( e.g. hernandez et al . 2005 ; see also rand & wallin 2004 ) .",
    "the assumption underlying the tw method , that the observed intensity is proportional to the tracer s density , limits its use to relatively dust and gas - free systems , _",
    "i.e. _  early - type galaxies . the model - dependent techniques , on the other hand , rely on the presence of gas and are therefore restricted to late - type barred galaxies .",
    "there is therefore no overlapping range in hubble type where both methods have been applied and compared .",
    "the number of successful applications of the tw method was initially rather limited : ngc 936 @xcite , ngc 4596 @xcite , ngc  1023 @xcite .",
    "more recently , larger samples have been obtained : @xcite present a study of five sb0 galaxies and @xcite study four early - type barred galaxies .",
    "the first successful application of the method using integral field ( fabry - perot ) absorption - line spectroscopy was presented by @xcite for ngc 7079 , while the first direct detection of kinematic decoupling in a double - barred galaxy , ngc 2950 , using the tw method was presented by @xcite .",
    "a surprising result emerging from these studies is that bars rotate as fast as they physically can ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "studies of dust extinction in disc galaxies have a long and checkered history ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we seek to quantify the effect of dust absorption on the tw method . to that end",
    "we will use the @xmath3-body simulations of barred galaxies by @xcite and @xcite and implement dust extinction by adjusting the weights of individual particles .",
    "our motivation for this study is to explore how important dust is for tw measurements of both early and especially late - type galaxies . in the latter",
    ", star formation can be a potential problem as it violates the basic assumption of the tw method .",
    "we therefore also explore the ability to measure @xmath0 in a hydrodynamical simulation of a barred galaxy that includes star formation @xcite    barred galaxies often display prominent dust lanes along the leading edges of the bar .",
    "numerical simulations associate the dust lanes with shocks in the gas streaming along the length of the bar @xcite . observations of velocity jumps across dust lanes , as well as the detection of dust lanes in radio continuum , confirm this interpretation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the introduction of efficient spectrometers operating in the ir the possibility now exists to carry out tw measurements in late - type galaxies , eliminating an important observational bias .",
    "we therefore test whether such measurements would be compromised by dust extinction and star formation .",
    "our results show that dust lanes on the leading edges of a bar change the tw derived value of @xmath0 depending on the geometry of the observations .",
    "this can lead to measured pattern speeds that differ by 40 percent or less from their true value for realistic dust lane models . as this change can be rather small and because the extinction can be observationally estimated , it suggests that the tw method can be applied to the full range of hubble type .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we summarize the tw method and describe the models to which we apply it in sections 2 and 3 respectively . in section 4",
    "we describe our models for the dust lane and the diffuse dust disc .",
    "the model predictions are presented in section 5 and in section 6 we compare the models to data and discuss the implications of our modeling .",
    "for any tracer population that satisfies the condition of continuity , it can be shown that @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are luminosity - weighted positions and velocities respectively .",
    "the surface brightness of the tracer population is @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the line - of - sight velocity minus the systemic velocity .",
    "the galaxy s inclination is given by @xmath9 and coordinates along its major and minor ( disc ) axes by @xmath10 .",
    "the weighting function , @xmath11 , can be chosen arbitrarily ( tw ) . for several slit observations ( _ i.e. _  @xmath12 ) , plotting @xmath1 versus @xmath2 produces a straight line with slope @xmath13 . in our experiments",
    ", we will refer to the slopes obtained from fitting such straight lines as @xmath14 , in order to distinguish from the intrinsic pattern speed @xmath0 obtained from the time evolution .",
    "we apply the tw method to the @xmath3-body models of barred galaxies described in section [ s : nbody ] as done by debattista ( 2003 , hereafter d03 ) . in our measurements , except where noted , we set the inclination @xmath15 and the projected angle between the bar major axis and disc major axis , pa@xmath16 , implying an intrinsic angle of @xmath17 , which is a favorable orientation for the tw method .    as in d03",
    "we use 11 slits each with a width of 0.1 ( initial ) disk scale - lengths ( the units of the simulation are described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to derive @xmath18",
    ". tests with slits half and twice as wide return nearly identical results .",
    "applications of the tw method to real data generally use between three and five long - slit spectra .",
    "( integral field observations could soon change this . ) a typical observational setup places one slit on the major axis and two slits on opposite sides either near the bar edges , or at half the bar radius .",
    "tests with such configurations in the simulations did not yield values of @xmath18 that were significantly different from the results derived with all 11 slits .",
    "the strongest constraints on the slope come from slits located about half a bar radius from the galaxy center .",
    "the leverage on the slope of the fit derived from spectra beyond this point is decreasing with radius , as is their signal - to - noise ratio ( _ cf .",
    "_  d03 ) .",
    "progressively removing pairs of the outermost slits from the set of 11 and repeating the measurements has little effect on @xmath18 , although it increases the scatter .",
    "in their study of the effect dust has on the observed kinematics of discs , @xcite used analytical distribution functions for the intrinsic stellar kinematics .",
    "however , such methods are ill - suited for modeling barred galaxies . in this paper we explore the effect of dust on barred systems using @xmath3-body and @xmath3-body+sph models .",
    "our four @xmath3-body simulations tw1-tw4 were evolved on a polar cylindrical grid code @xcite .",
    "the radial spacing of grid cells in this code increases logarithmically from the center and reaches to well past the edge of the model discs .",
    "we used fourier terms up to @xmath19 in the potential , which was softened with the standard plummer kernel .",
    "time integration was performed with a leapfrog integrator using a fixed time - step .",
    "these models use rigid halos ; this allowed us to sample the disc ( and bulge , if present ) component at high mass resolution .",
    "a full description of these models can be found in d03 and @xcite .",
    "briefly , the rigid halos were represented either by a spherical logarithmic potential or by a hernquist halo . in all models ,",
    "disc kinematics were set up using the epicyclic approximation to give a constant toomre @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that all the late - type models are bulgeless and only include a bulge component ( using the method of prendergast & tomer , 1970 ) in the early - type model presented in d03 .",
    "we use units in which the initial radial scale length of the disc particle distribution is @xmath21 ; in models tw1-tw4 the vertical scale height is then @xmath22 in these units . except where noted , we report results using these natural units . the resulting axisymmetric systems",
    "all formed rapidly rotating bars .",
    "the model tw5 is an unpublished simulation with an exponential disk + dominant live dark matter halo evolved with pkdgrav .",
    "because the halo was live and dominant in this simulation the bar ends well inside its co - rotation radius , i.e. it is a slow bar ( debattista & sellwood 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "this also causes the bar to be larger and stronger than any of the others .      in late type galaxies",
    "the rate of star formation ( hereafter sf ) can be substantial .",
    "thus stars violate the required condition of ( source - free ) continuity . to quantify the influence of",
    "sf we also include an @xmath3-body+sph model of a barred galaxy in our analysis .",

    "we implemented both morphologies in our experiments . since the results obtained with the curved dust lane morphology and the straight dust lane morphology are qualitatively and quantitatively similar we concentrate only on the latter in this paper .",
    "we implement dust lanes by defining rectangular areas on the bar s leading edges that mimic athanassoula s straight dust lanes .",
    "the dust lane geometry is fully specified by four parameters : the width of the dust lane ( @xmath39 ) , the angle the dust lane makes with the bar major axis ( @xmath40 ) , and the minimum and maximum extent of the dust lane ( @xmath41  and @xmath42  respectively ) along the @xmath43 ( bar ) axis . in practice",

    "quantitatively , the impact of dust in tw6 lies between the values in models tw1-tw4 and tw5 , with an @xmath18 value that differs from its true values ( at @xmath111 ) by 15 percent . scaling the intrinsic weights of the particles by their m / l ratio ( section  [ s : sf ] ) is a crucial part of model tw6 . as a test we therefore derive the pattern speeds in this model without any such scaling ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f : omega2 ] ) . without this",
    "scaling the effects of dust are comparable to the slow bar model tw5 with @xmath18 deviating from the intrinsic value by 21 percent .    to examine this more closely we divided the particles in two groups , those particles that were present in the simulation from @xmath112 ( ` old ' ) and the ones that were created subsequently by star formation ( ` new ' ) .",
    "the pattern speed derived from younger particles appears to be less affected by dust . in fact , subdivisions into younger ages show even shallower curves .",
    "interestingly , the dust free values of @xmath64 derived for the different age bins vary by less than eight percent from the full model",
    ". this may be somewhat fortuitous as there are fewer particles at younger ages to derive the tw value .",
    "their spatial extent is also smaller as these particles are mostly confined to the bar region and the nucleus .",
    "this behaviour is probably due to the similar location of dust lanes and sf regions . if star formation occurs or is enhanced on the leading edges of a bar , as is frequently observed , e.g. @xcite , then absorption by dust may be partially mitigated by the enhanced luminosity of the young particles .",
    "sf is indeed observed along the bar in this model .",
    "the experiments presented in this paper show that dust lanes on the leading edges of a bar tend to increase the tw derived value of the bar pattern speed , @xmath18 , when pa@xmath113 and decrease it when pa@xmath114 .",
    "the changes in @xmath18 are relatively modest for realistic dust lanes ( i.e. @xmath115 ) , between 8 - 25 percent ( cf . figs [ f : omega ] and [ f : omega2 ] ) and increasing to 20 - 40 percent at unrealistically large @xmath78 or if the bar is slow .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the simulation that includes star formation ( tw6 ) does not change this conclusion in a significant way .",
    "dust lanes alone therefore pose no serious problem when trying to extend the tw method to late - type barred galaxies .    figure  [ f : discussion]a illustrates why the measured @xmath18 changes when dust lanes are present . shown by solid lines in this figure are the spatial and velocity profiles along three slits in model tw1 in the absence of dust .",
    "the dashed lines show the same profiles but for a model that includes leading edge dust lanes when pa@xmath116 , while the dotted lines are for pa@xmath117 .",
    "the spatial profiles clearly show the asymmetric behaviour expected for this configuration ( cf figure  [ f : dustlane]b ) .",
    "the measured pattern speed @xmath18 follows from the slope of the linear fit to the means of the velocity and spatial profiles .",
    "the dust distribution affects both the spatial and the velocity profiles . if dust would alter only the spatial profiles but leave the velocity profiles unchanged then the slope of the linear fit would flatten , leading to slower pattern speed when pa@xmath118 .",
    "however , the associated change in @xmath1 due to the dust more than offsets this effect and the bar pattern speed therefore appears larger with dust than without .    the bars in models tw1 to tw4 are classified as ` fast ' .",
    "that is to say that the ratio of the co - rotation radius to the bar radius in these models is close to but greater than 1.0 .",
    "this ratio can not be smaller than 1.0 as that would violate self consistency @xcite .",
    "applications of the tw method to real data for early - type galaxies have not revealed slow ( i.e. with a ratio @xmath119 ) bars .",
    "we nevertheless included a slow bar , model tw5 , to examine the effect of dust in such a case . in this model",
    "the impact of dust on @xmath18 is larger than in the fast bars ( fig .  [",
    "f : omega ] ) this is not surprising as the absolute change in @xmath120 between successive steps in @xmath121 is , to within a factor two , independent of the details of a particular model .",
    "in other words , the factor by which dust acts to change @xmath18 is similar for all models and hence makes more of an impact on a slow bar .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in model tw6 ( fig .",
    "[ f : omega2 ] ) .",
    "the ratio of bar radius to corotation radius is about 1.5 indicating that this bar is slow - ish .",
    "the observed pattern speed is indeed more affected by dust than in models tw1-tw4 .",
    "an important concern with tw measurements in late - type systems is the requirement of a well constrained pa .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that a pa error of @xmath122 can result in pattern speed errors by up to 100 percent ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in real galaxies ,",
    "non - axisymmetric features can lead to uncertainties in the derived position angles ( and inclinations ) that are on average @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to select systems with well constrained pas when applying the tw method to real late - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented a @xmath123 color map of the sbc galaxy ngc  4123 that clearly delineates the dust lanes on the leading edges of its bar .",
    "they found that @xmath124 in the dust lanes .",
    "with the extinction law of @xcite this colour implies an average extinction in the dust lanes of @xmath125 magnitude .",
    "we checked this value using an @xmath126 archival wfpc2 f450w band image of ngc  4123 ( snap-9042 pi : smartt ) to compare a surface brightness profile across the dust lane ( i.e. parallel to the bar minor axis ) in the @xmath126 image to a similarly placed slit in model tw1 .",
    "we use @xmath127 to match the value implied by the @xcite colour map . as the exposure time of the @xmath126 image",
    "is only 160s we increase the @xmath128 of the surface brightness cut by summing over 100 pixels along the dust lane .",
    "this corresponds to a length of about 10 arcsec over the dust lane or a fifth of the bar radius ( weiner et al .",
    "the ragged line in figure  [ f : discussion]b shows the resulting surface brightness profile .",
    "the dust lane itself is clearly noticeable as the depression near @xmath129 arcsec .",
    "the smooth bold line represents a similar cut along the model image averaged over a similar fraction of the dust lane .",
    "the model profile is scaled ad hoc to match the peak in the ngc  4123 data : the resulting profile fits the observed one remarkably well . using this extinction ,",
    "the models shown in figures  [ f : omega ] & 6 predict a @xmath130 percent change in the observed bar pattern speed . if , on the other hand the observations were carried out in @xmath131-band using the co bandhead , the extinction of @xmath125 magnitudes translates to @xmath132 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 3 ) .",
    "this extinction would lead to insignificant errors in @xmath18 from obscuration .",
    "our results suggest that the application of the tw method can be extended to later - type barred galaxies .",
    "we therefore propose that at this time a test case of a tw measurement in a late - type galaxy is warranted .",
    "a useful approach would be to try a tw measurement on a bar with pattern speed measured by hydrodynamical modeling @xcite .",
