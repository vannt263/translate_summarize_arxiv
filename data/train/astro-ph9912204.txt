    "for the last year of operations of the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) the international agn watch successfully carried out an intensive continuous monitoring campaign on the bright seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  7469 ( @xcite ) . during the course of these observations we obtained a single high signal - to - noise uv spectrum covering 11503300    using the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "simultaneous high - energy x - ray observations were obtained using the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) ( @xcite , and a network of ground - based facilities obtained optical spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "these data sets have been used to study the structure of the continuum and line - emitting regions in ngc  7469 using reverberation mapping .",
    "previous iue and ground - based campaigns that have applied reverberation mapping techniques to the study of agn broad - line regions ( blr ) have greatly illuminated our understanding of their structure ( see the review by @xcite ) . the reverberation mapping method ( @xcite )",
    "uses the light - travel - time delayed response of the emission line clouds to variations in the continuum to unravel the spatial and kinematic structure of the blr .",
    "campaigns on ngc  5548 and ngc  3783 using iue ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and again on ngc  5548 using iue and hst ( @xcite ) have determined that the blr is smaller than single - zone photoionization models have suggested , and that it is highly stratified .",
    "inner and outer radii differ by an order of magnitude , and higher ionization lines are characteristically formed in the innermost regions .",
    "c c c c c y3b60106 t & g130h & 19:36:55 & 252.317 & 1200 y3b60107 t & g130h & 20:54:11 & 252.371 & 2240 y3b6010at & g190h & 22:30:41 & 252.438 & 1650 y3b6010bt & g270h & 23:06:26 & 252.463 & 300    analysis of the iue data for the ngc  7469 campaign ( @xcite ) have led to similar results for its broad emission lines .",
    "the most remarkable result , however , is the apparent detection of a time delay in the response of different uv continuum windows .",
    "the fluxes in bands centered at 1485  , 1740  , and 1825   have cross - correlation centroids with time delays of 0.21 , 0.35 , and 0.28 days with respect to the flux at 1315  .",
    "monte carlo simulations indicate probable errors of @xmath3 days in measuring the delays .",
    "even longer delays ( @xmath41 day ) are found for the optical continuum relative to the uv ( @xcite ) .",
    "a variety of explanations may lead to the observed effects .",
    "the most interesting in terms of the overall structure of agn is that the delays are due to a continuum reprocessing zone near the central continuum source .",
    "a more mundane possibility is that the delay is the result of contamination of the flux in the continuum bands by a very broad emission feature such as blended fe  ii emission or balmer continuum emission . while this can explain some portion of the uv - continuum delays , as we show later , it is difficult to ascribe the lag of the optical continuum to emission - line contamination .",
    "the higher spectral resolution and higher s / n of the fos spectrum of ngc  7469 allows a better assessment of the possible contaminants in the chosen iue continuum intervals . by using the fos spectrum as a template , a model of the line and continuum emission features",
    "can be fitted to the series of iue spectra .",
    "similar techniques were successfully used on the earlier ngc  3783 ( @xcite ) and ngc  5548 ( @xcite ) campaigns .",
    "this paper describes the fos data for ngc  7469 and presents new line and continuum flux measurements extracted from the iue data . in ",
    "2 we present the fos observations and the analysis of that spectrum . in ",
    "3 we describe how the template based on the fos data was fit to the time series of iue spectra and present a new analysis of the line and continuum variability based on these measurements . in ",
    "4 we discuss the uv and x - ray absorbing material in ngc  7469 .",
    "we discuss our results in  5 , and give a summary of our conclusions in  6 .",
    "we observed ngc  7469 on 1996 june 18 ( ut ) using gratings g130h , g190h , and g270h on the blue side of the fos .",
    "these three spectra cover the wavelength range 11503300   with a resolution of @xmath5 . the start times and integration times of the observations",
    "are given in table 1 .",
    "to ensure high s / n , good photometry and accurate flat - fielding , we observed through the 0.86@xmath6 aperture and acquired the target using a precision peak - up sequence .",
    "the last 5@xmath75 peak up was done using the 0.26@xmath6 sec aperture on 0.052@xmath6 centers . centering in the @xmath8 circular aperture was better than 0.04@xmath6 . the peak flux seen through the 0.26@xmath6 aperture at the last peak - up position has a ratio to that seen through the 0.86@xmath6 aperture used for the observation consistent with that of a point source .",
    "this should alleviate any concern that the spectrum might be contaminated by starlight from a nuclear starburst region .",
    "the standard pipeline calibration applied to the data gives good results .",
    "the two g130h observations agree to within 0.5% with each other . a weighted average of these two spectra was taken to produce a mean g130h spectrum .",
    "the overlap regions between the g130h , g190h , and g270h spectra agree to better than 1% . in the 14 separate groups read out for the g130h observation , there is a variation of 3.8% peak to peak .",
    "it is smooth and non - random , but could be an instrumental artifact such as thermal variations around the orbit .",
    "no renormalizations of the flux scale were applied to any of the spectra .",
    "we used the low ionization galactic absorption lines to correct the wavelength scale of each observation , assuming that these features are at zero velocity .",
    "g130h required a 0.3   shift to the blue , as did g270h .",
    "the g190h spectrum required no adjustment , but only the al  ii @xmath91670 line is strong enough to measure reliably .",
    "we estimate our wavelengths are accurate to @xmath450 @xmath10 .",
    "the merged , flux - calibrated spectrum from the four separate observations is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the s / n per pixel ( 0.250.50  ) is greater than 10 at all wavelengths longward of 1200  ; per 1  it exceeds 20 .",
    "in addition to the usual broad emission lines and blue continuum , note the pronounced dip in the spectrum at 2200   indicative of galactic extinction , and the broad blends of fe  ii emission that become apparent longward of 2000  .",
    "ngc  7469 also shows high - ionization , intrinsic absorption lines .",
    "these are shown in the c  iv region in fig .  2 , and they are also present in n  v and in ly@xmath2 .",
    "to model the lines and continuum in our spectrum , we used the iraf task specfit ( @xcite ) to fit a model comprised of a reddened power law in @xmath11    @xmath12    with extinction following the form given by cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) with @xmath13 , multiple gaussians for the emission lines , single gaussians for the galactic and intrinsic absorption lines , and a damped lorentzian profile for the strong galactic ly@xmath2 absorption .",
    "we used the minimum number of gaussian components necessary to acceptably fit each emission line .",
    "for the brightest emission lines , three gaussians ( narrow , broad , and very broad ) were typical .",
    "an exception is the si  iv+o  iv ] @xmath91400 complex .",
    "here we allowed single gaussians for each line in each multiplet set , with all relative wavelengths linked in proportion to their vacuum values .",
    "the widths of the two si  iv lines were linked to be identical , and their flux ratio was fixed at 2:1 .",
    "the widths of the five o  iv ] lines were also linked to be identical , but independent of the si  iv lines .",
    "their flux ratios were fixed in the proportion 0.1:0.2:1.0:0.4:0.1 as given by osterbrock ( 1963 ) , and the total o  iv ] flux varied independently of the si  iv flux .",
    "our fit covered the wavelength range 11703280  , excluding an 8   window centered on geocoronal ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "the best - fit @xmath14 is 7058 for 5479 points and 183 freely varying parameters .",
    "we compute our error bars from the error matrix of the fit assuming a @xmath15 for a single interesting parameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit continuum has a normalization of @xmath16 and a powerlaw index @xmath17 .",
    "the best fit extinction is @xmath18 , and the column density of the damped ly@xmath2 absorption is @xmath19 .",
    "( note that these errors are purely formal , statistical ones .",
    "systematic errors due to our assumption of a continuum shape and due to the exclusion of a large portion of the damped ly@xmath2 profile will be larger . )",
    "our measurements are in reasonable agreement with the properties of our own galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "the elvis , lockman , & wilkes ( 1989 ) survey of agn sight lines reports an h  i column of @xmath20 .",
    "using a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath21 ( @xcite ) predicts @xmath22 .    to 3.75 in to 14pt to 14pt    the individual components for the emission lines are listed in table 2 .",
    "parameters of the blueshifted intrinsic absorption features visible in ly@xmath2 , n  v , and c  iv are given in table 3 .",
    "galactic absorption features are listed in table 4 .",
    "the tabulated line widths are not corrected for the instrumental resolution of @xmath5 .",
    "table 2 + emission line fluxes in ngc 7469    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to 4.4 in to 14pt to 14pt    thus ngc  7469 is yet another instance of a seyfert galaxy possessing a complex assortment of absorbing regions .",
    "this was previously shown to be true for ngc  4151 ( @xcite ) and for ngc  3516 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the case of ngc  3516 is particularly illuminating since high resolution uv spectra show that multiple kinematic components are present , an additional indication that multiple regions are contributing to the absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "the seyferts ngc  4151 ( @xcite ) and ngc  5548 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) also appear kinematically complex when observed at high spectral resolution .",
    "in fact , in ngc  5548 , the prototypical example of a combined  xuv \" absorber ( @xcite ) , mathur et al .",
    "( 1999 ) now acknowledge that at most one of the six different kinematic components visible in the high - resolution uv spectrum actually arises in the x - ray absorbing zone .",
    "crenshaw and kraemer ( 1999 ) have identified the kinematic component with the highest blueshift as the one associated with the x - ray absorber in ngc 5548 .    to 4.8 in to 14pt to 14pt    to 3.6 in to 14pt to 14pt    while most seyferts with uv and x - ray absorption appear to have a complex assortment of absorbing regions with a broad range of physical conditions , this does not mean that these physically distinct regions are unrelated . since uv and x - ray absorption ( or the lack of both ) appears to be linked in most seyferts ( @xcite ) , it is likely that a common mechanism is responsible for both .",
    "possibilities for this mechanism include outflows of material ablated from the obscuring torus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , or a wind from the accretion disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a natural origin for the separate uv and x - ray absorbing clouds would be to have higher density clumps embedded in a more tenuous wind",
    ". the smaller , higher density clumps would have lower total column densities and lower ionization parameters , a requirement for the uv absorbers . the tenuous surrounding wind ( which may well have a range of physical conditions itself , e.g. @xcite ) could be the source for the x - ray warm absorber .",
    "in such a scenario one might also expect to see correlated variability in the total column density of the x - ray and uv absorbers related to ",
    "events \" in which new material was ablated from the torus or accretion disk into the outflowing wind .",
    "we have used a high s / n fos spectrum of ngc  7469 to produce a model template for extracting deblended emission line and continuum fluxes from the series of iue spectra obtained in the 1996 monitoring campaign .",
    "the fos spectrum shows that  continuum \" windows at 1315  , 1740   and 1825   used by wanders et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the original analysis have significant contaminating contributions from the wings of the broad emission lines and other low - level features such as o  i @xmath23 and fe  ii emission lines .",
    "our new extractions for the most part eliminate these contaminating components from the measured fluxes . using these cleaner data",
    ", we still find a time delay in the the response of the continuum flux at longer wavelengths relative to shorter wavelengths .",
    "we find time delays of 0.09 , 0.28 , and 0.36 days for the fluxes at 1485  , 1740   and 1825  , respectively , relative to f(1315  ) . when combined with the delays measured for the optical continuum by collier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we find that the wavelength dependence of the time - delay follows a @xmath24 relation that is consistent with the simplest models of radiative reprocessing .    the fos spectrum of ngc  7469 reveals associated absorption in the high - ionization lines n  v , c  iv and ly@xmath2 , a common feature of seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of ngc  7469 also shows evidence for an ionized absorber ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and we have analyzed the uv and x - ray absorbers in the context of a single uv / x - ray absorber ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find , however , that such a unified description is untenable .",
    "the predicted column densities of uv - absorbing ions in the best - fitting warm absorber model for the x - ray spectrum imply line strengths well below those observed .",
    "the uv absorption requires gas with a lower ionization parameter and lower column density .",
    "even though the x - ray and uv absorption in this seyfert and in many others requires a complex assortment of kinematic components with different physical conditions , the fact that associated uv absorption and x - ray warm absorbers are often found in the same objects ( @xcite ) suggests that the material for each of these absorbers has a common origin .",
