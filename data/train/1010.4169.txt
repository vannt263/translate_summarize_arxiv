    "it is well known that some liquids ( for example , water , silica , silicon , carbon , and phosphorus ) show an anomalous behavior in the vicinity of their freezing lines @xcite .",
    "the water phase diagrams have regions where a thermal expansion coefficient is negative ( density anomaly ) , self - diffusivity increases upon compression ( diffusion anomaly ) , and the structural order of the system decreases with increasing pressure ( structural anomaly ) @xcite .",
    "the regions where these anomalies take place form nested domains in the density - temperature @xcite ( or pressure - temperature @xcite ) planes : the density anomaly region is inside the diffusion anomaly domain , and both of these anomalous regions are inside a broader structurally anomalous region .",
    "it is reasonable to relate this kind of behavior to the orientational anisotropy of the potentials , however , a number of studies demonstrate waterlike anomalies in fluids that interact through spherically symmetric potentials @xcite .    as it was mentioned above ,",
    "three types of anomalies are the most discussed in literature with respect to the core - softened fluids - diffusion anomaly , density anomaly and structural anomaly . here",
    "we briefly discuss these anomalies .",
    "if we consider a simple liquid ( for , example , lennard - jones liquid ) , and trace the diffusion along an isotherm we find that the diffusion decreases under densification .",
    "this observation is intuitively clear - if density increases the free volume decreases and the particles have less freedom to move .",
    "however , some substances have a region in density - temperature plane where diffusion grows under densification .",
    "this is called anomalous diffusion region which reflects the contradiction of this behavior with the free volume picture described above .",
    "this means that diffusion anomaly involves more complex mechanisms which will be discussed below .",
    "the second anomaly mentioned above is density anomaly .",
    "it means that density increases upon heating or that the thermal expansion coefficient becomes negative .",
    "using the thermodynamic relation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a thermal expansion coefficient and @xmath3 is the isothermal compressibility and taking into account that @xmath3 is always positive and finite for systems in equilibrium not at a critical point , we conclude that density anomaly corresponds to minimum of the pressure dependence on temperature along an isochor .",
    "this is the most convenient indicator of density anomaly in computer simulation .",
    "the last anomaly we discuss here is structural anomaly .",
    "initially this anomaly was introduced via order parameters characterizing the local order in liquid .",
    "however , later on the local order was also related to excess entropy of the liquid which is defined as the difference between the entropy and the ideal gas entropy at the same @xmath4 point : @xmath5 .",
    "in normal liquid excess entropy is monotonically decaying function of density along an isotherm while in anomalous liquids it demonstrates increasing in some region .",
    "this allows to define the boundaries of structural anomaly at given temperature as minimum and maximum of excess entropy .",
    "the problem of anomalous behavior of core - softened fluids was widely discussed in literature ( see , for example , the recent review @xcite ) . it was shown that for some systems the anomalies take place while for others does not . in this respect the question of criteria of anomalous behavior appearance remains the central one . however",
    ", another important point is still lacking in the literature - the behavior of anomalies along different thermodynamic trajectories . here",
    "we call as `` trajectory '' a set of points belonging to some path in @xmath6 space . for example , the set of points belonging to the same isotherm we call as `` isothermal trajectory '' or shortly isotherm .    in our previous work we showed @xcite that anomalies can exist along some trajectories while along others",
    "the liquid behaves as a simple one .",
    "taking into account this result , it is interesting to study the behavior of the quantities demonstrating anomalies along the different physically significant trajectories ( isotherms , isochors , isobars and adiabats ) . this investigation will allow to get deeper understanding of the relations between anomalous behavior and thermodynamic parameters of the system which spread light on the connection between thermodynamic , structural and dynamic properties of liquids .",
    "the simplest form of core - softened potential is the so called repulsive step potential which is defined as following : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the diameter of the hard core , @xmath9 is the width of the repulsive step , and @xmath10 its height . in the low - temperature limit @xmath11 the system reduces to a hard - sphere systems with hard - sphere diameter @xmath9 , whilst in the limit @xmath12 the system reduces to a hard - sphere model with a hard - sphere diameter @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , melting at high and low temperatures follows simply from the hard - sphere melting curve @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the relevant hard - sphere diameter ( @xmath9 and @xmath8 , respectively ) .",
    "a changeover from the low-@xmath16 to high-@xmath16 melting behavior should occur for @xmath17 .",
    "the precise form of the phase diagram depends on the ratio @xmath18 . for large enough values of @xmath19",
    "one should expect to observe in the resulting melting curve a maximum that should disappear as @xmath20 .",
    "the phase behavior in the crossover region may be very complex , as shown in  @xcite .    in the present simulations",
    "we have used a smoothed version of the repulsive step potential ( eq .  ( [ 1 ] ) ) , which has the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "we have considered @xmath23 . here and below we refer to this potential as to smooth repulsive shoulder system ( rss ) .    in the remainder of this paper we use the dimensionless quantities : @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 . as we will only use these reduced variables ,",

    "data were subsequently collected during @xmath29 where the time step @xmath30 .    in order to map out the phase diagram of the system",
    ", we computed its helmholtz free energy using thermodynamic integration : the free energy of the liquid phase was computed via thermodynamic integration from the dilute gas limit  @xcite , and the free energy of the solid phase was computed by thermodynamic integration to an einstein crystal  @xcite . in the mc simulations of solid phases ,",
    "data were collected during @xmath31 cycles after equilibration . to improve the statistics ( and to check for internal consistency ) the free energy of the solid was computed at many dozens of different state - points and fitted to multinomial function .",
    "the fitting function we used is @xmath32 , where @xmath16 and @xmath33 are the temperature and specific volume and powers @xmath34 and @xmath35 are connected through @xmath36 .",
    "the value n we used for the most of calculations is 5 .",
    "for the low - density fcc phase n was taken equal to 4 , since we had less data points .",
    "the transition points were determined using a double - tangent construction .",
    "the region where thermodynamic anomalies are expected is situated close to the region where the system undergoes structural arrest . as a consequence , proper sampling of the phase space can be problematic . to overcome this problem we used parallel tempering  @xcite . instead of simulating a single system , we consider @xmath37 systems , each running in the nvt ensemble at a different temperature .",
    "systems at high temperatures go easily over potential barriers and systems at low temperatures sample the local free energy minima .",
    "the idea of parallel tempering is to attempt monte carlo temperature swaps between the systems at different temperatures .",
    "if the low and high temperatures are far apart , the probability to accept such a swap move is quite low . for this reason , we use a range of intermediate temperatures . during a parallel tempering simulation ,",
    "we generate equilibrium configurations for the system at all the temperatures in the simulation . in most cases",

    "one could argue that , in the glassy region , the present system behaves like a `` quasi - binary '' mixture of spheres with diameters @xmath8 and @xmath44 and that the freezing - point depression is analogous to that expected in a binary system with a eutectic point : there are some values of the diameter ratio such that crystalline structures are strongly unfavorable and the glass phase could then be stable even at very low temperatures .",
