    "magnetic helicity is an important quantity that reflects the topology of the magnetic field ( woltjer , 1958a , b and taylor , 1986 )",
    ". pioneering studies of magnetic helicity in solar physics have been performed by several authors focussing on the accumulation of magnetic helicity in the solar atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the force - free @xmath6 coefficient , and the mean current helicity density in solar active regions @xcite .",
    "besides the hemispheric sign distribution of large - scale helical features in active regions @xcite , there can be patches of right - handed and left - handed fields corresponding respectively to positive and negative helicities , intermixed in a mesh - like pattern in the sunspot umbra and a threaded pattern in the sunspot penumbra @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the individual magnetic fibrils tend to be dominated by the current density component caused by magnetic inhomogeneity , while the large - scale magnetic region tends to be dominated by the component of the current density associated with the magnetic twist .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the existence of global twist for a sunspot  even in the absence of a net current  is consistent with a fibril structure of sunspot magnetic fields .",
    "the redistribution of magnetic helicity contained within different scales was argued to be the interchange of twist and writhe due to magnetic helicity conservation ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the spectral magnetic helicity distribution is important for understanding the operation of the solar dynamo @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that , if the large - scale magnetic field is generated by an @xmath6 effect @xcite , it must produce magnetic helicity of opposite signs at large and small length scales @xcite .",
    "we call such a magnetic field bi - helical @xcite . to alleviate the possibility of catastrophic ( magnetic reynolds number - dependent ) quenching of the @xmath6 effect @xcite and slow saturation @xcite , one must invoke magnetic helicity fluxes from small - scale magnetic fields @xcite . in the present paper , we determine the spectrum of magnetic helicity and its relationship with magnetic energy from photospheric vector magnetograms of a solar active region .",
    "we use a technique that is based on the spectral representation of the magnetic two - point correlation tensor .",
    "it is related to the method of @xcite for determining the magnetic helicity spectrum from in situ measurements of the magnetic field in the solar wind .",
    "their key assumption allowing for the determination of magnetic helicity spectra is that of homogeneity . this technique was recently applied to data from _ ulysses _ to show that the magnetic field at high heliographic latitudes has opposite signs of helicity in the two hemispheres and also at large and small length scales @xcite",
    "; see also @xcite for results from corresponding simulations .",
    "in the present work , a variant is proposed where we assume local statistical isotropy in the horizontal plane to compute magnetic energy and helicity spectra .",
    "we have analyzed data from the solar active region noaa 11158 during 1115 february 2011 , taken by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "the pixel resolution of the magnetogram is about @xmath7 , and the field of view is @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : helispec1 ] shows photospheric vector magnetograms ( left ) and the corresponding distribution of @xmath9 ( right ) from the vector magnetograms of that active region on different days . here ,",
    "@xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the vertical component of the current density in si units with @xmath12 being the vacuum permeability , while in cgs units , the current density is @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the speed of light .",
    "the superscript ` @xmath15 ' on @xmath16 indicates that only the vertical contribution to the current helicity density is available .",
    "it turns out that the mean value of the current helicity density , @xmath17 , is positive and @xmath18g@xmath19km@xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , as a proxy of the force - free @xmath6 parameter , we determine @xmath20 , which is on the average @xmath21km@xmath5 . for future reference ,",
    "let us estimate the current helicity normalized to its theoretical maximum value , henceforth referred to as _ relative _ helicity .",
    "this is not to be confused with the gauge - invariant magnetic helicity relative to that of an associated potential field @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider the ratio @xmath22 as an estimate for the relative current helicity . for the active region",
    "noaa 11158 we find @xmath23 .",
    "this value is based on one snapshot , but similar values have been found at other times .",
    "let us now turn to the two - point correlation tensor , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the position vector on the two - dimensional surface , and angle brackets denote ensemble averaging or , in the present case , averaging over annuli of constant radii , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "its fourier transform with respect to @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the two - dimensional fourier transform , the subscript @xmath30 refers to one of the three magnetic field components , the asterisk denotes complex conjugation , and ensemble averaging will be replaced by averaging over concentric annuli in wavevector space .",
    "following @xcite , it is possible to determine the magnetic helicity spectrum from the spectral correlation tensor @xmath31 by making the assumption of local statistical isotropy . at the end of this paper we consider the applicability of this assumption in more detail . considering that @xmath32 defines the only preferred direction in @xmath33 , and that @xmath34 , the only possible structure of @xmath31 is ( cf .",
    "* ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a component of the unit vector of @xmath32 , @xmath37 is its modulus with @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the magnetic energy and magnetic helicity spectra , which has the correct sign . here ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are transverse and normal components of the fourier - transformed magnetic field . ] , normalized such that @xmath43 note that the mean energy density in @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "we emphasize that the expression for @xmath31 differs from that of @xcite by a factor @xmath46 , because we are here in two dimensions , so the differential for the integration over shells in wavenumber space changes from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "note that the magnetic vector potential is not an observable quantity , so the magnetic helicity might not be gauge - invariant .",
    "however , if the spatial average is over all space , or if the magnetic field falls off sufficiently rapidly toward the boundaries , both @xmath49 and @xmath40 are gauge - invariant . indeed , with the present analysis , @xmath40 is manifestly gauge - invariant , because it has been computed directly from the magnetic field as obtained through the photospheric vector magnetogram .",
    "the components of the correlation tensor of the turbulent magnetic field can be written in the form @xmath50 where we have defined the polar angle in wavenumber space , @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "for brevity , we have also skipped the arguments @xmath54 and @xmath55 on @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    in the following we present shell - integrated spectra . however , because we consider here two - dimensional spectra , they correspond to the power in annuli of radius @xmath54 and are obtained as @xmath56 where the angle brackets with subscript @xmath57 denote averaging over annuli in wavenumber space .",

    "positive ( negative ) values of @xmath59 are indicated by open ( closed ) symbols , respectively .",
    "@xmath60 ( red , dashed ) and @xmath61 ( blue , dash - dotted ) are shown for comparison .",
    "( b ) same as upper panel , but the magnetic helicity is averaged over broad logarithmically spaced wavenumber bins .",
    "[ fig : phelicity ] ]    the realizability condition @xcite implies that @xmath62 it is therefore convenient to plot @xmath63 and @xmath64 on the same graph , which allows one to judge how helical the magnetic field is at each wavenumber .",
    "furthermore , to assess the degree of isotropy , we also consider magnetic energy spectra @xmath65 and @xmath66 based respectively on the horizontal and vertical magnetic field components , defined via @xmath67 under isotropic conditions , we expect @xmath68 .",
    "we now consider magnetic energy and helicity spectra for the active region noaa 11158 .",
    "the calculated region of the field of view is @xmath69 , i.e.  @xmath70 pixels or @xmath71 .",
    "we present first the results for noaa 11158 at 23:59:54ut on 13 february 2011 ; see figure  [ fig : phelicity](a ) .",
    "it turns out that the magnetic energy spectrum has a clear @xmath4 range for wavenumbers in the interval @xmath72 .",
    "the magnetic helicity spectrum is predominantly positive at intermediate wavenumbers , but we also see that toward high wavenumbers the magnetic helicity is fluctuating strongly around small values . to determine the sign of magnetic helicity at these smaller scales , we average the spectrum over broad , logarithmically spaced wavenumber bins ; see the lower panel of figure  [ fig : phelicity ] .",
    "this shows that even at smaller length scales the magnetic helicity is still positive , again consistent with the fact that this active region is at southern latitudes .    , showing @xmath39 ( upper panel ) and @xmath63 ( lower panel ) for the other days .",
    "[ fig : heli_phelicity_bran_zhq5_ene ] , title=\"fig : \" ] , showing @xmath39 ( upper panel ) and @xmath63 ( lower panel ) for the other days .",
    "[ fig : heli_phelicity_bran_zhq5_ene ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    to calculate the relative magnetic helicity @xmath73 , we define the integral scale of the magnetic field in the usual way as @xmath74 the realizability condition of equation  ( [ realizability ] ) can be rewritten in integrated form ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as @xmath75 in particular , we have @xmath76 .",
    "this gives @xmath77 which obeys @xmath78 .",
    "again , this quantity is not to be confused with the gauge - invariant helicity of @xcite . for the active region",
    "noaa 11158 at 23:59:54ut on 13 february 2011 we have @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , so @xmath82 .",
    "the relative magnetic helicity has thus the same sign as the relative current helicity .",
    "the corresponding magnetic column energy in the two - dimensional domain of size @xmath83 is @xmath84 , which is about three times larger than the values given by @xcite .",
    "the magnetic column helicity is @xmath85 .",
    "several estimates of the gauge - invariant magnetic helicity of noaa 11158 using time integration of photospheric magnetic helicity injection @xcite and nonlinear force - free coronal field extrapolation @xcite suggest magnetic helicities of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "this value would be comparable to ours if the effective vertical extent were @xmath87 .",
    "we should remember , however , that there is no basis for such a vertical extrapolation of our two - dimensional data .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic energy spectra @xmath65 and @xmath66 based respectively on the horizontal and vertical magnetic field components agree remarkably well at wavenumbers below @xmath88 , corresponding to length scales larger than 2 mm .",
    "this suggests that our assumption of isotropy might be a reasonable one .",
    "the mutual departure between @xmath65 and @xmath66 at larger wavenumbers could in principle be a physical effect , although there is no good reason why the magnetic field should be mostly vertical only at small scales .",
    "if it is indeed a physical effect , it should then in future be possible to verify that this wavenumber , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 depart from each other , is independent of the instrument .",
    "alternatively , this departure might be connected with different accuracies of horizontal and vertical magnetic field measurements @xcite .",
    "if that is the case , one should expect that with future measurements at better resolution the two spectra depart from each other at larger wavenumbers .",
    "in that case , our spectral analysis could be used to isolate potential artefacts in the determination of horizontal and vertical magnetic fields .    in figure  [ fig : heli_phelicity_bran_zhq5_ene ] we show @xmath89 and @xmath58 for different days .",
    "it turns out that on small scales the spectra are rather similar in time , and that there are differences in the amplitude mainly on large scales .",
    "also the sign of @xmath59 remains positive for the different days .",
    "we find that the mean spectral values of magnetic energy of the active region at the solar surface is consistent with a @xmath4 power law , which is expected based on the theory of @xcite and consistent with spectra from earlier work on solar magnetic fields @xcite , ruling out the @xmath90 spectrum suggested by @xcite and @xcite .    .",
    "]    under isotropic conditions , the current helicity spectrum , @xmath91 , is related to the magnetic helicity spectrum via @xcite @xmath92 it is normalized such that @xmath93 . in figure",
    "[ fig : phc ] we show @xmath94 obtained in this way . for @xmath95",
    ", the current helicity spectrum shows a @xmath4 spectrum , which is consistent with numerical simulations of helically forced hydromagnetic turbulence @xcite , and indicative of a forward cascade of current helicity .",
    "similar spectra have also been obtained for the analogous case of kinetic helicity @xcite .",
    "these results imply that the relative helicity decreases toward smaller scales ; see the corresponding discussion on p.  286 of @xcite .",
    "we have applied a novel technique to estimate the magnetic helicity spectrum using vector magnetogram data at the solar surface .",
    "we have made use of the assumption that the spectral two - point correlation tensor of the magnetic field can be approximated by its isotropic representation .",
    "this assumption is partially justified by the fact that the energy spectra from horizontal and vertical magnetic fields agree at wavenumbers below @xmath96 .",
    "however , it will be important to assess the assumption of isotropy in future work through comparison with simulations .",
    "an example are the simulations of @xcite , who employed however only a one - dimensional representation of the spectral two - point correlation function . nevertheless , the present results look promising , because the sign of magnetic helicity is the same over a broad range of wavenumbers and consistent with that theoretically expected for the southern hemisphere .",
    "this is consistent with the right - handed twist inferred from all previous studies of noaa 11158 using different methods . except for the smallest wavenumbers ,",
    "magnetic and current helicities have essentially the same sign .",
    "therefore , a sign change is only expected at smaller wavenumbers corresponding to scales comparable to those of the sun itself .",
    "it would be useful to extend our analysis to a larger surface area of the sun to see whether there is evidence for a sign change toward small wavenumbers and thus large scales reflecting the global magnetic field of the solar cycle .",
    "such a change of sign is expected from dynamo theory @xcite and is a consequence of the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : phelicity ] gives indications of an opposite sign for @xmath97 , which corresponds to scales that are still much smaller than those of the sun .",
    "however , measurements of spectral power on scales comparable to those of the observed magnetogram itself are not sufficiently reliable .",
    "our results suggest that the unsigned current helicity spectrum shows a @xmath4 power law .",
    "this is in agreement with simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence @xcite and implies that the turbulence becomes progressively less helical toward smaller scales .",
    "our results suggest that at a typical scale of @xmath98 mm , the relative magnetic helicity reaches values around @xmath99 .",
    "this magnetic helicity must have its origin in the underlying dynamo process , and can be traced back to the interaction between rotation and stratification .",
    "@xcite parameterized these two effects in terms of a stratification parameter gr and a coriolis number co and found that the relative kinetic helicity is approximately 2grco .",
    "for the sun , they estimate @xmath100 , so a relative helicity of 0.04 might correspond to @xmath101 . for the solar rotation rate",
    ", this corresponds to a correlation time of about 6 hours , which translates to a depth of about 8 mm .",
    "again , more precise estimates should be obtained using realistic simulations .",
    "in addition to measuring magnetic helicity over larger regions , it will be important to apply our technique to many active regions covering both hemispheres of the sun and different times during the solar cycle .",
    "this would allow us to verify the expected hemispheric dependence of magnetic helicity .",
    "compared with previous determinations of the hemispheric dependence of current helicity @xcite , our technique might allow us to isolate instrumental artefacts resulting from different resolutions of vector magnetograms for horizontal and vertical magnetic fields .",
