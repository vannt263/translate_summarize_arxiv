    "also , dynamic aspects of a network , such as its synchronizability and random walk properties , can be obtained from the eigenvalues of the laplacian and normalized laplacian matrices from which it is possible to calculate some interesting graph invariants like the estrada index and the laplacian energy  @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", there has been a particular interest in the study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the normalized laplacian matrix , since many measures for random walks on a network are linked to them .",
    "these include the hitting time , mixing time and kemeny s constant which can be considered a measure of the efficiency of navigation on the network , see  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec  [ pre ] , we recall an operation called triangulation that can be applied to any simple connected graph . in sec",
    "[ sec3 ] , we determine the spectra of the normalized laplacians of iterated triangulations of any simple connected graph and we discuss their structure .",
    "finally , in sec  [ app ] , we use the results found to calculate three significant invariants for an iterated triangulation of a graph : the multiplicative degree - kirchhoff index , its kemeny s constant and the number of spanning trees .",
    "let @xmath0 be any simple connected graph with vertex set @xmath1 and edge set @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the number of vertices of @xmath4 and @xmath5 its number of edges .",
    "we consider a graph operation known in different contexts as henneberg 1 move  @xcite , @xmath6-extension  @xcite , vertex addition  @xcite and triangulation  @xcite . here",
    "we will use the latter name as it is more common in recent literature .",
    "[ define ] .",
    "the triangulation of @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath7 , is the graph obtained by adding a new vertex corresponding to each edge of g and by joining each new vertex to the end vertices of the edge corresponding to it .",
    "we denote @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9-triangulation of @xmath4 is obtained through the iteration @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be the total number of vertices and edges of @xmath13 .    from this definition clearly",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 and thus we have : @xmath16    figure  [ fig.1 ] shows an example of iterated triangulations where the initial graph is @xmath17 or the triangle graph . in this particular case , the resulting graph is known as scale - free pseudofractal graph  @xcite that exhibits a scale - free and small - world topology .",

    "the last graph invariant considered is the number of spanning trees of a graph @xmath4 .",

    "let @xmath70 be the set of all the newly added vertices in @xmath13 and @xmath71 be its complement .",

    "@xcite we know that the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues of @xmath32 is 1 .",

    "a markov chain is aperiodic if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of the markov matrix is different from @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath37 is not equal to @xmath110 if and only if random walks on @xmath13 are aperiodic .",
    "since each edge of @xmath13 , @xmath115 , belongs to an odd - length cycle ( a triangle ) , the graph is aperiodic  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath116 holds for @xmath115 .",
