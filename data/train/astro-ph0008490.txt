    "two young compact star clusters have been observed within a few tens of parsecs of the galactic center : the arches cluster ( object 17 , nagata et al .",
    "1995 ) and the quintuplet cluster ( afgl2004 , nagata et al . 1990",
    "; okuda et al . 1990 ) , for which excellent observational data are available . in terms of structural parameters  size , mass , density profile  and ages , these systems may represent the galactic counterparts to ngc2070 ( r136 ) , the central star cluster in the 30doradus region in the large magellanic could ( massey & hunter 1998 ) . the arches and quintuplet clusters lie behind thick layers of absorbing material , hinting that many more such systems may exist .",
    "recently , dutra & bica ( 2000 ) have reported from the 2mass survey a total of 58 star cluster candidates within @xmath7pc ( in projection ) of the galactic center .",
    "a number of important questions make these clusters worthy of detailed study , among them : ( 1 ) how are such clusters related to globular clusters ? ( 2 ) how do they contribute to the total star formation rate in the galaxy ? ( 3 ) are their mass functions in reality intrinsically flat , as is suggested by observations ? ( 4 ) how far are these clusters from the galactic center ? ( 5 ) how many are hidden , still waiting to be discovered ? in this letter",
    "we summarize the results of a series of simulations of young compact star clusters in the vicinity of the galactic center , and address specifically the last item on this list .",
    "we found that the lifetimes of our model clusters depend very sensitively on their distances from the galactic center .",
    "this is mainly due to the larger size of tidally limited clusters lying farther from the galactic center , resulting in longer relaxation times and therefore longer lifetimes .",
    "the majority of our models are visible only for the first part of their lifetimes , and are likely to be indistinguishable from the stellar background at later times .",
    "we find that the true number of young compact star clusters within 200 pc of the galactic center is at least 10 but could easily exceed 50 .    a more comprehensive paper , exploring all of these questions in more detail and presenting the results of an extensive parameter - space study , is in preparation ( portegies zwart et al .",
    ", 2000b ) .",
    "we study the evolution of our model clusters by following the equations of motion of all stars by direct integration , at the same time taking into account the internal evolution of both stars and binary systems .",
    "the `` starlab '' software environment within which this work was performed is described in detail by portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2000a ; see also http://www.sns.ias.edu/@xmath8starlab ) . the special - purpose grape-4 system ( makino et al .",
    "1997 ) was used to accelerate the computation of gravitational forces between stars",
    ".    observed parameters for the arches and quintuplet clusters are listed in table[tab : observed ] .",
    "these clusters have masses of @xmath9 and are extremely compact , with half - mass radii @xmath10pc ( figer , mclean & morris 1999 ) . the projected distance from the arches to the galactic center",
    "is about 34pc ; the quintuplet cluster lies somewhat farther out , at @xmath850pc .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : n12kinit ]    the mass of the galaxy within the clusters orbit at a distance ( @xmath11pc ) is taken to be ( mezger et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{eq : mgal}\\ ] ] this mass distribution determines the strength and geometry of the local galactic tidal field ( for details see portegies zwart et al .",
    "the evolution of the cluster is followed using the starlab kira integrator and the binary evolution program ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "for each selected distance to the galactic center we carried out three calculations .",
    "one series of runs was carried out with identical initial realizations of the system ( stellar masses , positions and velocities , with a total mass of 7432 ) .",
    "the same initial model can be used at several galactocentric distances because the shape of the zero - velocity surface does not depend sensitively on distance to the galactic center .",
    "table[tab : n12kinit ] gives results of these calculations .",
    "for each galactocentric distance we also performed two additional calculations ( for a total of 9 runs ) with different initial realizations of the systems .",
    "these calculations were performed to study the uncertainties in cluster lifetimes , and to ascertain the reproducilility of our results .",
    "the calculations with different initial realizations produced roughly 10% spreads in core collapse times ( @xmath13 ) and cluster lifetimes ( @xmath14 ) . for reasons of economy ,",
    "stars were removed from all calculations when they exceeded a distance of 3 from the cluster center .",
    "figure[fig : spz_w147n12k_tm ] shows the evolution of cluster mass and number of stars for the models listed in table [ tab : n12kinit ] which began with identical initial conditions but different galactocentric distances .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , clusters located farther from the galactic center live considerably longer than those closer in .",
    "the longer lifetime of the more distant cluster is mainly a consequence of its longer relaxation time .",
    "scaling the relaxation time at the tidal radius of model r34w4 to a distance of 150pc results in a lifetime of @xmath15myr ( @xmath16 ) , which is slightly smaller than the @xmath17myr lifetime of the models r150w4 . mass loss from stellar evolution , which is more prominent in model r150w4",
    "because the cluster survives longer , seems to be a minor factor in driving the evolution .",
    "the number of stars in each model ( dashed lines , see figure1 ) decreases more rapidly than the total mass ( solid lines )",
    ". thus the mean mass of the stars within the cluster increases gradually with time .",
    "although clusters like the arches and quintuplet systems are very compact , it may still be hard to see them near the galactic center because the projected foreground and background stellar density is so high .",
    "integration of the local stellar density ( obtained by differentiating eq.[eq : mgal ] ) along the line of sight then gives the surface density .",
    "portegies zwart et al.(2000b ) perform this calculation numerically and arrive at a surface density at 34 pc of about 3000pc@xmath18 .",
    "while the contrast in the surface density of the cluster relative to that of the background is perhaps an oversimplified measure of the cluster s observability , the results of this simple comparison are quite instructive , and a more comprehensive consideration of luminosity density leads to essentially similar overall conclusions .",
    "figure[fig : spz_w17r34_rho_phm ] shows the evolution of the surface density within the projected half mass radius for models r34w4",
    "( dots ) , r90w4 ( dashes ) and r150w4 ( solid ) .",
    "the two points with error bars indicate the projected half - mass densities for the arches ( left ) and quintuplet ( right ) clusters .",
    "the horizontal dotted line gives the background surface density at a projected distance of 34pc from the galactic center .",
    "the projected densities of the two observed clusters are between 3 ( for the quintuplet ) and 50 ( for arches ) times higher than the background ; clusters with densities below a few times the projected background stellar density may well remain unnoticed .",
    "a simplified model for the evolution of these star clusters may be constructed as follows .",
    "the initial relaxation time at the tidal radius may be calculated using eq.[eq : mgal ] and spitzer s ( 1987 ) expression as @xmath19 the constant is obtained by substitution of the appropriate units .",
    "the mass of the cluster decreases almost linearly in time ( see figure[fig : spz_w147n12k_tm ] ) as @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the age at which the cluster dissolves in the tidal field of the galaxy .",
    "the projected surface density within the half - mass radius of the cluster is @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the mass contained within the projected half - mass radius , and @xmath25 depends on the density profile , but is always smaller than unity . for a king model with @xmath26 , we find @xmath27 .",
    "substitution of eqs.[eq : l1 ] and [ eq : mgal ] into eq.[eq : sigma ] gives @xmath28,\\ ] ]    the projected surface density @xmath29 decreases with time because the cluster mass decreases and the half - mass radius of the cluster increases .",
    "substitution of eq.[eq : mass ] into eq.[eq : sigma ] gives : @xmath30 the half - mass radius increases by about a factor of two during the first half mass relaxation time and remains roughly constant thereafter . in our simple model",
    "we implement this by allowing @xmath31 to increase by a factor two in the first half mass relaxation time and to remain constant at later times .",
    "the fact that the half - mass radius remains roughly constant at late times , and does not decrease as @xmath32 as would be expected for a tidally limited system , is a consequence of our use of the total mass , rather than the mass within the jacobi surface ( see figure[fig : spz_w147n12k_tm ] ) , in determining both and @xmath29 .",
    "the resulting surface density evolution agrees very well with our calculations .",
    "figure[fig : rgct_dens ] shows the evolution of the projected density as a function of distance from the galactic center for our simple model . clusters close to the galactic center are compact enough to be easily visible ( dark shades ) for a large fraction of their lifetimes , but they dissolve quickly .",
    "clusters farther from the galactic center live much longer , but their surface densities are generally low , lying well below the background for most of their lifetimes .",
    "the two well - observed clusters both lie in the lower left corner ( high density region ) of figure[fig : rgct_dens ] .",
    "the arches and quintuplet clusters inhabit only a small portion of the available parameter space . however , the region they populate is most favorable for finding clusters , because the projected surface densities of such clusters are high .",
    "we estimate the number of clusters like the arches and the quintuplet based on the fact that both clusters lie at the lower left corner ( youngest and most compact ) in figure[fig : rgct_dens ] .",
    "we assume that all clusters with ages less than @xmath33myr and within 50pc of the galactic center have been found by observers , and all outside this region are as yet undetected .",
    "we further assume that clusters populate the triangular area in figure[fig : rgct_dens ] more or less uniformly  probably not a bad assumption , since the galactic mass is roughly proportional to radius ( see equation[eq : mgal ] ) . with these assumptions ,",
    "the number of yet - to - be - found clusters is ( @xmath3460myr@xmath35200pc)/(5myr@xmath3550pc)=24 times more than the number of known clusters .",
    "thus , we expect that the total number of clusters in this region would be around 50 .    a conservative lower limit to the number of hidden clusters",
    "may be obtained using the same technique , but adopting the observed projected density of the quintuplet system as the limiting contrast at which such clusters can be discovered .",
    "the projected density of the quintuplet exceeds the background density by about a factor three .",
    "figure[fig : rgct_dens ] then suggests that about 20% of the available surface area harbors visible cluster . a lower limit to the total number of clusters within 200pc of the galactic center",
    "would then be around 10 .",
    "these estimates are in excellent agreement with the results of dutra & bica ( 2000 ) mentioned earlier , although the above reasoning suggests that even these 58 candidate clusters may represent only a small fraction of the number actually present .",
    "finally , we note that a population of 100 clusters with masses of @xmath36 each and a maximum lifetime of @xmath37myr implies a star formation rate of 0.01 per year , enough to build up the entire bulge of @xmath37 within the 10gyr age of the galaxy .",
