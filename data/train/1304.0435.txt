    "the rc stars are core - helium - burning stars on the horizontal branch of the hertzsprung  russell diagram .",
    "they lie on the red counterpart of the horizontal branch in the colour - magnitude diagrams of the globular clusters @xcite .",
    "one of the most important features of the rc stars is their very limited luminosity distribution in all photometric systems which makes them standard candles for estimating astronomical distances in galactic and extra  galactic scales .",
    "thus , a mean absolute magnitude obtained for the rc stars in any photometric system may be very useful in studies where distance is a crucial parameter .    using _ hipparcos _ astrometric and photometric data @xcite , @xcite found the spectral types ( g8iii - k2iii ) of the rc stars in the solar neighbourhood and estimated that their absolute magnitudes are @xmath5 mag .",

    "by re - observing the rc stars in the sample of @xcite , @xcite obtained a mean absolute magnitude of @xmath9 mag for these stars , which is a very consistent value with the mean in @xcite . in one of the most recent studies , @xcite calibrated the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 absolute magnitudes of the rc stars in terms of the colours in the johnson ",

    "these sensitivities correspond to the vega magnitudes of 16.5 , 15.5 , 11.2 and 7.9 mag .",
    "thus , _ wise _ will go one magnitude deeper than the 2mass @xmath7-band data in @xmath15 for sources with spectra close to that of an a0 star and even deeper for moderately red sources like k stars or galaxies with old stellar populations .",

    ".    the mean absolute magnitudes of the rc stars can be affected by galactic population differences .",
    "a weak dependence of the @xmath20-band absolute magnitude of the rc stars in the solar neighbourhood on @xmath21 $ ] was found by @xcite .",
    "he suggested an absolute magnitude correction of 0.07 mag in the @xmath20-band for large magellanic cloud . @xcite and @xcite predicted mean absolute magnitudes in @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 bands for the rc stars for a large range of ages and metallicities from the models of @xcite .",
    "according to their models , the absolute magnitudes of the rc stars in @xmath20-band depends both on metallicity and age .",
    "metallicity dependence of @xmath22-band absolute magnitudes for the rc stars was recently studied by @xcite using a sample of globular and open clusters .",
    "they presented an absolute magnitude calibration including the @xmath24 colour and @xmath21 $ ] metallicity of the rc stars in the clusters with a wide range of metallicities . as mentioned above",
    ", @xcite suggested that dependence of the mean @xmath7-band absolute magnitude of the rc stars on metallicity is negligible .",
    "although there are neither theoretical nor observational studies for the metallicity dependence of the _ wise _ photometric bands on age and/or metallicity , it may be estimated that this dependence , if present , must not be important .    as _ wise _",
    "can go at least one magnitude deeper than the 2mass for the rc stars , a mean absolute magnitude of these stars in any _ wise _ photometric band may be very useful .",
    "thus , their mean magnitudes and locations in the colour spaces should be estimated using newly released _ wise _ data @xcite . in this study",
    ", we aim to estimate mean absolute magnitudes for the rc stars with mir photometry , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",

    "section 4 is devoted to testing the absolute magnitude estimation , and finally , we give conclusions in section 5 .",
    "as the aim of this study is to estimate mir absolute magnitudes of the rc stars using their precise trigonometric parallaxes , the rc stars in the solar neighbourhood should be selected .",
    "thus , the main sample in this study was constructed using the newly reduced _",
    "hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite .",
    "stars with the relative parallax errors @xmath25 were selected from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue which allows us to study a stellar sample with precise distances in the solar neighbourhood . in order to obtain 2mass and",
    "_ wise _ magnitudes of the stars selected from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , we matched the selected sample with the available 2mass point source catalog @xcite and _ wise _ all - sky data release @xcite according to the equatorial coordinates .",
    "the number of stars matched in the both photometric system is 46,214 which are from different luminosity classes and spectral types .",
    "the observed trigonometric parallaxes are systematically biased , called lutz - kelker bias @xcite , and this should be corrected for the stars with @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we corrected the observed _ hipparcos _ parallaxes of the stars in our sample using the method in @xcite who described the lutz - kelker correction ( lk ) analytically , as follows    @xmath27{1 - 16(\\sigma_\\pi / \\pi)^2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the observed and corrected parallaxes , respectively , and @xmath30 denotes the observed parallax error .",
    "although we study the stars in the solar neighbourhood , the reddening should be taken into account .",
    "thus , we used the dust maps taken from @xcite and evaluated an @xmath31 colour excess for each star .",
    "we then reduced them using the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "details of the procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "distributions of the reduced colour excesses of the stars in our sample ( 46,214 stars ) according to the galactic latitude are shown in fig .",
    "the median value of the reduced colour excesses for all the galactic latitude intervals is @xmath320.03 mag .",
    "@xcite showed that the rc stars can be effectively detectable in @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands of the _ wise _ photometry while dwarfs can be found using @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we preferred @xmath15 and @xmath17 bands in order to identify the rc stars in _ wise_. for de  reddening the magnitudes @xmath15 and @xmath17 , we adopted the equations in @xcite derived by means of a spline function fitted to the data of @xcite which cover a range of @xmath33 @xmath14 m :    @xmath34    absolute magnitudes were calculated by setting the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes , apparent magnitudes and total absorptions in the pogson s equation .",

    "median errors for the @xmath15 and @xmath17 filters are 0.081 and 0.015 mag , respectively .",
    "median colour error for the rc stars is @xmath40 mag .    in order to test the dependence of the mean absolute magnitudes in @xmath41-bands on the relative parallax errors",

    "the colour are decreasing with increasing relative parallax errors .",
    "although the parallax errors are very small for the stars in the second column of table 1 , the number of stars with @xmath42 is about ten times smaller than the ones with @xmath44 .",
    "while the number of stars increases about ten times , the mean absolute magnitudes and colour decrease about 0.06 and 0.007 mag , respectively . this small change indicates the reliability of the sample in this study .",
    "the mean absolute magnitudes and colors for the sub - samples in the last two columns of table 1 are in agreement .",
    "although the lk - correction for the stars with @xmath45 is larger , this agreement demonstrates that there are no crucial lk - correction effects on the mean values obtained for the sub - samples in the last two columns of table 1 .",
    "moreover , the number of stars with @xmath44 is about two times larger than the ones with @xmath43 . with these reasons",

    "difference between the estimated and evaluated @xmath35 colours originates from the deviation of @xmath17 magnitude , as expected .",
    "second test was done using the comparison of the distances estimated from _",

    "we removed 23 of 245 stars from the sample as their distance errors are too high , decreasing the number of stars to 222 .",
    "these rc stars with @xmath47 pc give us the chance to compare their distances estimated by two different , photometric and spectrophotometric , methods .",
    "we obtained the _ wise _ magnitudes of the stars from the _ wise _ all - sky data release @xcite according to the equatorial coordinates in @xcite . the _ wise _ magnitudes and colour of these 222 stars were de - reddened using the colour excesses in @xcite and eq .",

    "11b and d. these figures demonstrate that there is good agreement between the distances calculated using the both methods .",
    "the mean of the differences between two sets of distances and the corresponding standard deviations are @xmath50 pc and @xmath51 pc for fig 11a and @xmath52 pc and @xmath53 pc for fig 11c .",
    "there are 153 stars in both panels within the @xmath54 limits , 69 per cent of the sample .",
    "in this study , we identified the rc stars with the _ wise _ photometry for the first time .",

    "another comparison was made between the distances obtained using the _ wise _ absolute magnitudes and those taken from @xcite who used a spectrophotometric method .",
    "conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows ,    * the rc stars occupy a very small region in the _ wise _ colour - magnitude diagram of the stars in the solar neighbourhood , as expected from the general properties of these stars in other photometric systems .",
    "* the adopted _ wise _ absolute magnitudes and colour of the rc stars are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath55 mag . * as for the effect of lk - corrected parallaxes on the results , it is found that selecting different limits for the relative parallax errors , provided that it is higher than 0.10 , does not considerably affect the mean absolute magnitudes and the colour of the rc stars . *",
    "the 2mass absolute magnitudes and colours of the rc stars are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 mag . *",
    "the _ wise _ absolute magnitudes and colour of the rc stars are in good agreement with the semi - empirical ones evaluated from the transformation equations . * from the comparisons of the distances estimated using the _ wise _ absolute magnitudes and the ones calculated using a spectrophotometric method , we conclude that agreement of two sets of distances confirms the confidence of the absolute magnitudes in question .    as stated above , _",
    "wise _ photometry goes one magnitude deeper than the 2mass photometry for sources with spectra close to that of an a0 star , and even deeper for moderately red sources like k stars or galaxies with old stellar populations .",
    "hence , we suggest that the absolute magnitudes estimated in this study can be used in the distance calculations for new sets of the rc stars at relatively larger distances . for example , these values can be used to estimate the galactic model parameters , in order to test any degeneracy between different parameters of the galactic components .",
