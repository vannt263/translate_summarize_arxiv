    "in the search of universal limit distribution functions and limit processes , we consider the kpz universality class ( kpz for kardar - parisi - zhang ) originally introduced for stochastic growth models  @xcite .",

    "one such model is the polynuclear growth ( png ) model in discrete time , which has two interesting limits , where new processes have been discovered .",
    "the first limit is the continuous time png model , for which it has been shown that the surface growing in a droplet shape is , in the large time limit , governed by the airy@xmath2 process  @xcite .",
    "the second one is the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) , in which quite recently the limit process of the particles positions starting from a periodic initial conditions has been unravelled and called airy@xmath1 process  @xcite . in the surface growth picture",
    "this corresponds to the flat initial conditions .",
    "if @xmath6 denotes the position of particle with label @xmath7 , one of the usual geometric representation of the tasep in terms of surface growth is obtained by the graph @xmath8 , see figure  [ fig4regimes ] ( right ) and also e.g.  @xcite . by universality",
    "it is expected that the limit process in one - dimensional kpz growth is the airy@xmath2 process for the curved regions of the limit shape , and the airy@xmath1 process for the flat parts .",
