    "in string theory the strings are the matter and consequently the inner structure of string is not defined .",
    "it is like to the situation in the classical and quantum field theories : the point - like electron does not have any inner structure .",
    "it is well known that the structureless electron leads to such difficulties as the infiniteness electron mass , infinities in loops of feynman diagrams and so on . in string theory",
    "the pointwise electron is dragged out in one dimension and the inner structure remains yet unknown .",
    "einstein has offered an idea that pointwise electron has an inner structure and it is a bridge ( wormhole on the modern language ) between remote parts of a universe . up to",
    "now this program is not realized as there are many difficulties connected with this idea .",
    "for instance the geometrical interpretation of the spin is not clear in this electron model . in ref s @xcite it is shown that this idea may be is more applicable for strings not for pointlike particles . in these papers",
    "it is shown that in the standard 5d kaluza - klein gravity there is flux tube solutions filled with electric and magnetic fields and certain part of this solution can be superlong and superthin .",
    "the cross section of this flux tube can be choosen in the planck region and consequently the tube can be considered as 1-dimensional object , namely a @xmath0string .",
    "@xmath1 means that the ends of the tube are similar to a river delta because a spacetime foam spreads these attachment points .    in ref s @xcite the properties of the central part of the solution are investigated . in this paper",
    "the peripheral parts of the @xmath1-string solution will be studied .",
    "we will see that they have asymptotically flat spaces ( tails ) and intermediate regions . by neglecting the intermediate regions whole construction is similar to @xmath2branes with string stretched between them .",
    "we investigate the 5d metric @xmath3 in the following form @xmath4 the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the even functions and consequently the metric has a wormhole - like form ; @xmath7 is the magnetic charge .",
    "the form of @xmath8 @xmath9 leads to the appearance of the radial electric and magnetic f fields .",
    "the 5d einstein s equations are @xmath10 here @xmath11 are 5-bein indices ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are 5d ricci tensor and the scalar curvature respectively ; @xmath14 .",
    "the 5d einstein s equations for the metric are @xmath15 the solution of maxwell equation is @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the electric charge .",
    "the solutions are parametrized by electric @xmath17 and magnetic @xmath7 charges @xcite : as the relative strengths of the electric ans magnetic fields are varied is found that the solutions evolve in a following way :    1 .",
    "the solution is a wormhole - like object .",
    "the throat between the surfaces at @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is defined as follows : @xmath21 ) is filled with both electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the longitudinal distance between the @xmath19 surfaces increases by @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   @xmath23 . in this case",
    "the solution is an infinite flux tube filled with constant electrical and magnetic fields .",
    "the cross - sectional size of this solution is constant ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "3 .   @xmath25 . in this case",
    "we have a singular finite flux tube located between two ( + ) and ( - ) electrical and magnetic charges located at @xmath26 .",
    "thus the longitudinal size of this object is finite , but now the cross sectional size decreases as @xmath27 .    by @xmath28",
    "the solution is the infinite flux tube @xmath29 here we have parallel electric @xmath30 and magnetic @xmath31 fields with equal @xmath32 electric and magnetic charges , @xmath33 .",
    "this solution is 5d analog of the 4d levi - civita - robertson - bertotti solution @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0string solution is the solution with @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in ref .",

    "the linear sizes of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are in the planck region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the next relation using numerical and approximate analytical calculations is derived @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath28 this relation is exact one but for the @xmath45 and in the region @xmath46 $ ] this relation was verified using numerical and approximate analytical calculations only .",
    "this equation shows us that in the region @xmath36 the cross section of the flux tube has the same order : @xmath47 . if @xmath48 then the tube can be considered as one dimensional object because @xmath49 is the least length in the nature . also the investigations show us that the length @xmath50 of the tube can be arbitrary long depending on @xmath51 : @xmath52 .",
    "all that allows us to call this flux tube as a string - like object : @xmath0string .",
    "now we would like to show that the @xmath0string solution is nonsingular at the points @xmath19 where @xmath21 .",
    "for this we investigate the solution behaviour near to the point @xmath53 where @xmath54 the substitution in equations - gives us the following solution @xmath55 in this case equation has the following behaviour near to the points @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some constant depending on @xmath59 .",
    "it leads to the following @xmath60 behaviour @xmath61 where @xmath62 is some integration constant .",

    "it means that at the points @xmath65 the metric is nonsingular .",
    "now we would like to consider @xmath68 parts of the solution .",
    "the numerical investigation of the equations - are presented on fig s [ fig : a]-[fig : prod ] ,    we search the asymptotical behavior of the metric in the form @xmath69 the solution is @xmath70 the numerical investigation ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : prod ] ) shows us that at the infinity @xmath71 and consequently @xmath72 after substitution in equations - we have @xmath73 as @xmath74 and @xmath75 then on the tails of the @xmath0string solution ( @xmath76 ) @xmath77 this fact allows us to say that the size of the intermediate region of the @xmath0string solution is @xmath78 .",
    "thus the @xmath0string solution has the superthin and superlong flux tube , two intermediate regions and two almost flat spaces , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tails ] .",
    "if the cross section of the throat is in the planck region then whole construction looks like a string attached to two d - branes ( if we neglect of the intermediate regions ) .",
    "such comparison has the deep physical sense as we can isometrically insert the considered spacetime in a sufficiently large minkowski spacetime and then really the throat of the superthin and superlong flux tube is 1d object as planck cell is minimally accessible volume in the nature .",
    "finally we would like to show that the solution considered here is not ordinary black metrics presented in review @xcite . at first we consider the asymptotical form of the metric @xmath79 where the asymptotical form of the metric is @xmath80 immediately we see that the @xmath81 coordinate @xmath82 in this region becomes timelike and the time coordinate @xmath83 spacelike one .",
    "for the clarification of the physical meaning of the asymptotical metric we have to bring it to the standard kaluza - klein form with new 4d metric @xmath84 and new electromagnetic potential @xmath85 @xmath86 ^ 2 -       \\frac{g_{tt } g_{55}}{g_{55}\\omega^2 - g_{tt } }       \\left (              d\\chi + q \\cos \\theta d \\varphi          \\right)^2 -   \\\\      & dr ^2 - r^2 \\left ( d \\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta d \\varphi^2)\\right )   \\end{split } \\label{sec2_250}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) is new form of the metric on the tails",
    ". here @xmath83 coordinate is new @xmath81 coordinate and @xmath82 is new time coordinate .",
    "this form of the metric shows that there is a rotation connected with the term @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath41-component of electromagnetic potential depends on @xmath90 and @xmath40 coordinates and consequently we have the radial and @xmath40-components of the magnetic field in addition to the radial electric field .",
    "all of this leads to the appearance of the angular momentum density for the electromagnetic field which is the origin for the rotation term @xmath89 .",
    "it allows us to say that considered here metric is none of the black hole solutions presented in review @xcite .",
    "this investigation shows us that in the pure multidimensional vacuum gravity exist wormhole - like solutions which can be approximately considered as two d - branes and a string between them with some intermediate regions between them .",
    "one interesting characteristic property of the presented regular solution is that the metric signature is changed at some points @xmath19 : @xmath91 by @xmath92 is changed on @xmath93 by @xmath68 .",
    "it means that on the @xmath0string the time coordinate is @xmath83 coordinate but on the tails ( d - branes ) the time coordinate is 5-th coordinate @xmath82 .",
