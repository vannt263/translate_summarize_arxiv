    "the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) is an ideal laboratory for testing theories of spiral galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it appears to be representative of giant spiral galaxies in the nearby universe ( hammer et al .",
    "2007 ) , and it is the only giant spiral galaxy where we can accurately measure the complete star formation history from an external vantage point , using photometry reaching below the oldest turnoff on the stellar main sequence . using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , we obtained deep optical photometry of six fields in m31 ( figure 1 ) , with which we reconstructed the star formation history at various points in the spheroid , disk , and giant stellar stream ( brown et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) . as a supplement to those studies",
    ", we present in this paper the reduced images and their associated photometric catalogs , along with characterizations of the photometric scatter and completeness derived from artificial star tests .",
    "these high - level science products ( hlsps ) can facilitate comparison with other studies of stellar populations in nearby galaxies or aid in the planning of additional observations in andromeda itself .",
    "the characteristics of the six fields shown in figure 1 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "images were obtained using the wide field camera on the acs , in the f606w ( broad @xmath0 ) and f814w ( @xmath1 ) filters .",
    "these data were obtained as part of three large ( @xmath2 100 orbits ) guest observer ( go ) programs ( go-9453 , go-10265 , and go-10816 ) in _ hst _ observing cycles 11 , 13 , and 15 .",

    "the primary distinction is that each program obtained systematically shallower images than the preceding one .",
    "when the original program was planned for the halo11 field , no images of m31 had reached significantly below the luminosity of the horizontal branch , let alone the main sequence turnoff . given the uncertainties , the original program was designed to reach @xmath31.5  mag below the oldest main sequence turnoff that might be present , in order to ensure an unambiguous characterization of the detailed star formation history . the position of the halo11 field on the minor axis was chosen to optimize the crowding ( trading population sample size against photometric uncertainties ) .",
    "in addition , the halo11 field was chosen to be in the vicinity of other historical probes of the m31 spheroid . from an analysis of subsets of the data from the original program ( go-9453 )",
    ", we were able to empirically determine how the fidelity of the recovered star formation history depended upon the depth of the photometry .",
    "this analysis showed that a depth of @xmath31  mag below the oldest main sequence turnoff was sufficient to characterize the star formation history . by using this shallower depth in our second program ( go-10265 )",
    ", we were able to determine the star formation history in two fields without increasing the overall size of the observing program .",
    "as with the first program , the locations of the fields within the targeted structures ( disk and giant stellar stream ) were again chosen to provide near - optimal levels of crowding .",
    "in contrast , the third program ( go-10816 ) targeted regions of the m31 spheroid far sparser than those in the first two programs . because it was necessary to trade depth against the number of fields to ensure an adequate sample size ,",
    "the third program was designed to reach @xmath30.8  mag below the oldest main sequence turnoff in each of its fields .    besides the above differences in the photometric depth between programs , there were also differences among the fields of the third program .",
    "that program planned to obtain one halo field at 21 kpc and three halo fields at 35 kpc along the minor axis , thereby providing approximately the same number of stars in each of these two locations . due to a hardware failure in the acs during cycle 15 ,",
    "the third program was terminated before it obtained any observations in the final 35 kpc field , and so the sample size at 35 kpc is approximately 2/3 of that at 21 kpc .",
    "furthermore , one of the fields in the third program ( halo35b ) had significant deviations from the planned f814w exposures .",
    "guide star problems caused some exposures to fail outright and other exposures to be significantly offset ( @xmath380@xmath4 ) from the planned pointing .",
    "the problematic exposures were rescheduled with a 102@xmath5 change in orientation .",
    "our reduction process for the first two programs was fully documented in brown et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , to which we refer readers for details .",
    "note that the catalog produced by brown et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the halo11 , stream , and disk fields was subject to more rigorous detection thresholds and culling procedures than that produced by brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the halo11 field ; while the earlier catalog is thus deeper , it also included more spurious sources .",
    "the reduction for the subsequent fields ( halo21 , halo35a , and halo35b ) was documented in brown et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "the process used in the later fields was similar to that in brown et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , with the additional correction for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) .",
    "a cti correction was unnecessary for the photometry in the first two programs , given the crowded field , high background , and relative youth of the detector .",
    "we briefly summarize the reduction process here .",
    "the individual exposures for each bandpass in a given field were registered using the positions of bright stars well - detected in each exposure .",
    "the exposures were then combined using the drizzle package ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) , including correction for geometric distortion , rescaling to 0.03@xmath4 pixel@xmath6 , and rejection of cosmic rays and hot pixels .",
    "the individual frames in each field were drizzled to a 7500@xmath77500 pixel output image , and then this output image was cropped to a 7000@xmath77350 pixel image with the world coordinate system in the header intact . as part of this process , the sky background was subtracted from individual frames prior to drizzling ( to avoid increasing the noise in a process that essentially interlaces the individual frames ) , and then the sky background was restored to the coadded images ( to ensure that the counting statistics in subsequent object detection and photometry routines were appropriate ) .",
    "psf - fitting photometry was then performed with the daophot - ii software of stetson ( 1987 ) .",
    "the psf - fitting photometry was corrected to agree with aperture photometry of isolated stars , with the zeropoints calibrated at the 1% level . for the fields in the third program ,",
    "the cti correction of riess & mack ( 2005 ) was applied .",
    "our photometry is in the stmag system : @xmath8  log@xmath9  mag , where @xmath10 e@xmath11 , where exptime is the exposure time , and photflam is @xmath12 erg s@xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath6 / ( e@xmath14 s@xmath6 ) for the f606w filter and @xmath15 erg s@xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath6 / ( e@xmath14 s@xmath6 ) for the f814w filter .",
    "for those more familiar with the abmag system , abmag  =  stmag  @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and abmag  =  stmag  @xmath18 mag for @xmath19 .",
    "note that brown et al .",
    "( 2006 ) shifted the stream photometry 0.03  mag brighter in @xmath19 and 0.014  mag redder in @xmath20 color .",
    "these shifts produced excellent agreement between the distributions of stars on the horizontal branch and red giant branch ( rgb ) in the halo11 and stream fields .",
    "the shift in brightness is justified by the fact that the stream is located behind andromeda ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2003 ) , while the shift in color is well within the calibration and reddening uncertainties .",
    "the stream catalog presented here does not include these shifts in color and magnitude .",
