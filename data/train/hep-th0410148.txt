    "topological solitons i.e. stable , particle - like objects with a non - vanishing topological charge occur in various contexts of the theoretical physics .",
    "for example , as magnetic monopoles and vortices seem to play crucial role in the problem of the confinement of the quarks in the quantum chromodynamics @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , it is believed that other type of solitons so - called cosmic strings and domain walls are important for the time evolution of the universe and formation of long range structures @xcite , @xcite . moreover , as d - branes , they appear in the string theory as well . they are observed also in various experiments in the condensed matter physics ( see for instance @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite quantum liquids ) .",
    "in fact , richness of the possible application of solitons is enormous .",
    "+ in particular , hopfions i.e. topological solitons with the non - trivial hopf index @xmath3 have been recently analyzed in a connection with the non - perturbative regime of the gluodynamics .",
    "namely , it has been suggested by faddeev and niemi @xcite that particles built only of the gauge field , so - called glueballs , can be described as knotted solitons with a non - vanishing value of the hopf number .",
    "it is a natural extension of the standard flux - tube picture of mesons where , due to the dual meissner effect , quark and anti - quark are confined by a tube of the gauge field . in the case of absence of quark sources ,",
    "such a flux - tube should form a knotted , closed loop . then",
    ", stability of the configuration would be guaranteed by a non - zero value of the topological charge . a model ( so called the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model @xcite ) , based on an effective classical three component unit field ( which is believed to represent all infrared important degrees of freedom of the full quantum theory )",
    "has been proposed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , using some numerical methods many topological solitons with the hopf index have been found @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , since all faddeev - niemi knots are known only in the numerical form some crucial questions ( e.g. their stability ) are still far from a satisfactory understanding .",
    "the situation is even worse . for a particular value of the hopf index",
    "it is not proved which knot gives the stable configuration . because of the lack of the analytical solutions of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model such problems as interaction of hopfions , their scattering or formation of bound states have not been solved yet ( for some numerical results see @xcite ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , in order to deal with hopfions in an analytical way , many toy models have been constructed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in general , all of them are invariant under the scaling transformation . it not only provides the existence of hopfions but also gives an interesting way to circumvent the derrick theorem @xcite .",
    "this idea is quite old and has been originally proposed by deser et al .",
    "@xcite . as a result ,",
    "topological hopfions with arbitrary hopf number have been obtained .",
    "unfortunately , on the contrary to the faddeev - niemi knots , all toy hopfions possess toroidal symmetry i.e. surfaces of the constant @xmath4 are toruses ( they are called unknots ) .",
    "it strongly restricts applicability of these models .",
    "+ the main aim of the present paper is to find a systematic way of construction of analytical configurations with the hopf charge , which in general do not have the toroidal symmetry and can form really knotted structures , as for instance the trefoil knot observed in the faddeev - skyrme - niemi effective model .",
    "moreover , our approach allows us to construct multi - knot configurations , where knotted solutions are linked and form even more complicated objects .",
    "+ moreover , though obtained here knots do not satisfy the faddeev - skyrme - niemi equations of motion , there are arguments which allow us to believe that our solutions ( we call them as eikonal knots ) can have something to do with faddeev - niemi hopfions . in our opinion",
    "this paper can be regarded as a first step in construction of analytical topological solutions in the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model .",
    "the relation between the eikonal knots and the faddeev - niemi hopfions will be discussed more detailed in the last section . + our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we test our method taking into consideration the eikonal equation in the @xmath5 minkowski space - time . in this case , obtained multi - soliton configurations occur to be solutions of the well - known @xmath6 sigma model .",
    "thus , we are able to calculate the energy of the solitons and analyze the bogomolny inequality between energy and the pertinent topological charge i.e. the winding number .",
    "we show that all multi - soliton solutions saturate this inequality regardless of the number and positions of the solitons .",
    "it must be underlined that all results of this section are standard and very well known .",
    "nonetheless , we include this part to give a pedagogical introduction to the next section .",
    "+ section 3 is devoted to investigation of knotted solutions .",
    "due to that we solve the eikonal equation in the three dimensional space and find in an analytical form multi - knot solutions with arbitrary hopf index .",
    "however , in this case no lagrangian which possesses all these configurations as solutions of the pertinent equations of motion is known .",
    "only one of our knots can be achieved in the nicole @xcite or aratyn - ferreira - zimerman @xcite model .",
    "+ finally , the connection between the eikonal knots and the faddeev - niemi hopfions is discussed .",
    "we argue that our solutions could give a reasonable approximation to the knotted solitons of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model .",
    "let us start and introduce the basic equation of the present paper i.e. the complex eikonal equation @xmath7 in @xmath5 or @xmath0 dimensional space - time , where @xmath8 is a complex scalar field .",
    "it is known that such a field can be related , by means of the standard stereographic projection , with an unit three component vector field @xmath9 .",
    "namely , @xmath10 this vector field defines the topological contents of the model .",
    "depending on the number of the space dimensions and asymptotic conditions this field can be treated as a map with @xmath11 or @xmath12 topological charge .",
    "+ in this section we focus on the eikonal equation in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "the main aim of this section is to consider how the eikonal equation generates multi - soliton configurations . from our point of view",
    "the two dimensional case can be regarded as a toy model which should give us better understanding of the much more complicated and physically interesting three dimensional case .",
    "+ in order to find solutions of equation ( [ eikonal ] ) , we introduce the polar coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 and assume the following ansatz @xmath15 which is a generalization of the standard one - soliton ansatz . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are integer numbers .",
    "then @xmath8 is a single valued function .",
    "additionally @xmath18 is a complex constant . after substituting it into the eikonal equation ( [ eikonal ] )",
    "one derives @xmath19 one can immediately check that it is solved by the following two functions , parameterized by the positive integer numbers @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are arbitrary , in general complex , constants .",
    "we express them in more useful polar form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are some real numbers .",
    "thus , the solution reads @xmath27 where the constant @xmath28 with @xmath29 has been included as well .",
    "+ from now , we restrict our investigation only to the family of the solutions given by ( [ sol_o3_1 ] ) . in the other words we have derived the following configuration of the unit vector field @xmath30 + 1 } \\label{soln_o3_1}\\ ] ] @xmath31 + 1 } \\label{soln_o3_2}\\ ] ] @xmath32 -1}{\\sum_{i , j=0}^n a_ia_jr^{k_i+k_j } \\cos [ ( k_i - k_j)\\phi + ( \\psi_i-\\psi_j)]+1}. \\label{soln_o3_3}\\ ] ] let us shortly analyze above obtained solutions . + first of all one could ask about the topological charge of the solutions .",
    "the corresponding value of the winding number might be calculated from the standard formula @xmath33 however , since the introduced ansatz is nothing else but a particular ( polynomial ) rational map one can take into account a well - known fact that the topological charge of any rational map of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a polynomial , is equal to degree of this polynomial . thus @xmath36 quite interesting , we can notice that the total topological charge of these solutions is fixed by the asymptotically leading term i.e. by the biggest value of @xmath17 whereas the local distribution of the topological solitons depends on all @xmath17 numbers .",
    "+ in fact , if we look at our solution at large @xmath13 then the vector field wraps @xmath37 times around the origin .",
    "as we discus it below , our configuration appears to be a system of @xmath38 solitons with a topological charge @xmath39 , where @xmath38 depends on @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the total charge is a sum of @xmath38 individual charges @xmath42 let us now find the position of the solitons .",
    "it is defined as a solution of the following condition @xmath43 thus points of location of the solitons fulfil the equation @xmath44=0 . \\label{position_solit_o3}\\ ] ] unfortunately , we are not able to find an exact solution of equation ( [ position_solit_o3 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath45 . of course , it can be easily done using some numerical methods .",
    "let us restrict our consideration to the two simplest but generic cases . + we begin our analysis with @xmath46 .",
    "this case , simply enough to find exact solutions , admits various multi - soliton configurations .",
    "one can find that examples with more complicated ansatz i.e. larger @xmath45 seem not to differ drastically .",
    "the main features remain unchanged .",
    "+ for @xmath46 equation ( [ position_solit_o3 ] ) takes the form @xmath47+a_0",
    "\\label{position_solit_o3_n1}\\ ] ] we see that there are @xmath48 solitons , each with unit topological number , located symmetrically on the circle with radius @xmath49 in the points @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "+ another simple but interesting example is the case with @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ". then equation ( [ position_solit_o3 ] ) reads @xmath54=0 \\label{position_solit_o3_n2}\\ ] ] the solitons are located in the following points @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "it is clearly seen that there are two different types of solitons .",
    "at the origin , we have a soliton with the winding number equal to @xmath58 . around it , there are @xmath59 satellite solitons with an unit topological charge .",
    "+ in fig.1 - fig.4 such soliton ensembles are demonstrated ( we plot @xmath4 component ) .",
    "for simplicity reason , we assume @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we see that there is a soliton with @xmath62 at the origin . additionally , one , two , four or eight single satellite solitons are shown . in fig.5 the case with @xmath63 and @xmath64 is plotted .",
    "it is very similar to fig .",
    "2 but now , the soliton located at the origin is thicker - it possesses @xmath65 topological charge .",
    "one can easily continue it and find more complicated multi - soliton configurations .",
    "+   + it can be shown that presented configurations are also solutions of a dynamical system i.e. the well - known non - linear @xmath6 sigma model @xmath66 this fact permits us to call the solutions of the two dimensional eikonal equation as solitons .",
    "+ in order to show it we take advantage of the stereographic projection ( [ stereograf ] ) .",
    "then the lagrangian ( [ o(3 ) ] ) takes the form @xmath67 the pertinent equation of motion reads as follows @xmath68 it is straightforward to see that it is possible to introduce a submodel defined by the following two equations : a dynamical equation @xmath69 and a non - dynamical constrain @xmath70 which is just the eikonal equation .",
    "one can notice that every solution of the submodel fulfills the field equation for the original model as well .",
    "however , it has to be underlined that the space of solutions of the original model is much larger than the restricted theory .",
    "+ inserting the ansatz ( [ anzatz o3 ] ) into the first formula ( [ eqmot_o3_2 ] ) we obtain @xmath71 one can easily check that solutions ( [ sol_o3_1 ] ) and ( [ sol_o3_2 ] ) satisfy this equation .",
    "it proves that our multi - soliton configurations are not only solutions of the eikonal equation but also are generated from lagrangian ( [ o(3 ) ] ) .",
    "thus , we are able to calculate the corresponding energy .",
    "it is easy to see that all solutions possess finite total energy .",
    "in fact , @xmath72 part of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath73}{\\left ( \\sum_{i , j=1}^n a_ia_jr^{k_i+k_j } \\cos [ ( k_i - k_j)\\phi+(\\psi_i-\\psi_j ) ] + 1 \\right)^2 } \\label{t00}\\ ] ] does not have any point - like singularities and tends to zero for @xmath74 sufficiently fast to assure finiteness of the energy .",
    "+ we explicitly calculate the total energy in the case @xmath52 . using previously obtained solution we find that @xmath75 this integral can be evaluated and one obtains @xmath76 it is equivalent to the following relation @xmath77 the multi - soliton solutions saturate the famous energy - charge inequality for @xmath6 sigma model i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "it means that they are stable .",
    "it is not possible to have less energy solutions with a fixed value of the total topological number .",
    "it is worth to stress that a single soliton solution with @xmath79 topological index has exactly the same energy as collection of @xmath79 solitons with an unit charge .",
    "moreover , the energy of the multi - soliton solutions does not depend on the relative position of the solitons .",
    "it gives us the possibility to analyze scattering of the solitons using the standard moduli - space method .",
    "+ as it was said before , all result presented in this section are well known .",
    "however , we have reproduce them from a new point of view i.e. using the complex eikonal equation .",
    "it is nothing surprising if we observe that the eikonal equation in the two dimensions leads to a generalization of the cauchy - riemann equations @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "since all baby skyrmions are rational functions of the @xmath82 variable ( or @xmath83 ) thus they can be in the natural way found in the eikonal equation .",
    "let us now turn to the complex scalar field @xmath8 living in the @xmath84 dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "analogously as in the previous section such a complex field can be used , via the stereographic projection , to parameterize a three component unit vector field @xmath85 : @xmath86 due to the fact that all static configurations , such that @xmath87 for @xmath88 , are maps @xmath89 , can be divided into disconnected classes and characterized by a pertinent topological charge , so - called hopf index @xmath3 . in this section",
    "we will show how such configurations can be generated by means of the complex eikonal equation in the three space dimensions @xmath90 in order to find exact solutions we assume the toroidal symmetry of the problem and introduce the toroidal coordinates @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is a constant of dimension of length fixing the scale .",
    "moreover , we propose a generalized version of the aratyn - ferreira - zimerman - adam ansatz @xcite , @xcite given by the following formula @xmath96 where @xmath97 are integer numbers whereas @xmath98 are unknown real functions depending only on the @xmath99 coordinate .",
    "additionally , @xmath100 is a complex number . inserting our ansatz",
    "( [ anzatz ] ) into the eikonal equation ( [ eikonal1 ] ) one derives @xmath101 @xmath102 thus the unknown shape functions @xmath98 should obey the following equations @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for all @xmath106 .",
    "the first set of the equations can be rewritten into the form @xmath107 in the case of the positive sing we obtain solutions which have been originally found by adam @xcite @xmath108 they correspond to the following asymptotic value of the unit vector field @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the minus sing the solutions read @xmath111 and the asymptotic behavior of the unit field is @xmath112 and @xmath113 let us now consider the second set of equations ( [ cond2 ] ) and express constants as before i.e. @xmath114 .",
    "we also take advantage of the fact that every @xmath98 has to fulfill equation ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "then , inserting ( [ sol_cond1 ] ) into ( [ cond2 ] ) we obtain that @xmath115 it leads to the relation @xmath116 or @xmath117 finally , we derive the consistency conditions relating the integer constants included in ansatz ( [ anzatz ] ) @xmath118 in other words , our ansatz ( [ anzatz ] ) is a solution of the eikonal equation ( with functions @xmath119 given by ( [ sol_plus ] ) or ( [ sol_minus ] ) ) only if the ratio between the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath120 is a constant number . + it is easy to notice that one can find more general solution of the complex eikonal equation than the ansatz .",
    "in fact , using the simplest one - component solution with @xmath121 @xmath122 we are able to generate other solutions .",
    "it follows from the observation that any function of this solution solves the eikonal equation as well .",
    "thus @xmath123 where @xmath124 is any reasonable function , gives a new solution @xcite .",
    "now , our ansatz can be derived by acting a polynomial function @xmath124 on the fundamental solution @xmath18 i.e. @xmath125 .",
    "+ calculation of the total hopf index corresponding to the upper obtained solutions can be carried out analogously as in the two - dimensional case .",
    "then , one obtains that @xmath126 of course , it can be also found directly by calculation how many times the vector field @xmath85 wraps in the angular directions . for @xmath46 and @xmath127",
    "we see that @xmath85 wraps @xmath128 times around @xmath129-direction and @xmath130 times around @xmath14-direction , giving @xmath131 .",
    "one can also see that for a non - vanishing @xmath100 ( but still for the one - knot configuration ) the vector field behaves identically .",
    "thus , the topological charge is still @xmath131 . for the multi - knot case",
    ", one has to not only add topological charges of the elementary hopfions but also take into account the linking number . as we discuss it in the next subsection , it leads to the same total hopf index i.e. @xmath131 .",
    "analogous calculations can be carried in the case of @xmath52 . + it is worth to stress that analogously to the winding number in the @xmath6 sigma model in @xmath5 dimensions , the total hopf index is fixed by the asymptotically leading term in our ansatz",
    ". the other components of the ansatz affect only the local topological structure of the solution .",
    "+ the position of the solution can be easily found if we recall that in the core of a knot the vector field takes the opposite value than at the spatial infinity @xmath132 where @xmath133 then a knotted solution is represented by a curve corresponding to @xmath134 .",
    "+ in further considerations we take solution ( [ sol_minus ] ) , for which @xmath135 as @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "thus the core of a knot is located at @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , it is given by a curve being a solution to the equation @xmath139 + \\ ] ] @xmath140+c_0 ^ 2=0 , \\label{position_solit_gen}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the simplest but sufficiently interesting cases with @xmath46 as well as @xmath52 are analyzed below .",
    "for @xmath46 the last equation can be rewritten in the following form @xmath143+c_0 ^ 2=0 .",
    "\\label{position_solit_gen_1}\\ ] ] thus , knots are located at @xmath144    due to the fact that @xmath145 is the monotonic function from @xmath146 to @xmath147 , there is exactly one @xmath148 satisfies upper condition .",
    "thus , obtained configuration is given by a closed curve ( or curves ) ( [ pos_sol_curve1 ] ) wrapped on a torus @xmath149 .",
    "in general , for fixed values of the parameters @xmath150 one finds that the number @xmath38 of the elementary knots is equal to the greatest common divisor @xmath128 and @xmath130 .",
    "the whole multi - knot solution is a collection of such elementary knots which are linked together .",
    "of course , every elementary knot should be treated in the same manner as others so they all carry the identical topological charge @xmath151 , where @xmath152 are relative prime numbers and @xmath153 .",
    "we immediately see that simple sum of all charges of elementary knots is not equal to the total topological number @xmath154 . in order to correctly calculate the topological charge one has to take into account the linking number @xmath155 between elementary knots as well .",
    "finally , we derive that @xmath156 correctness of this formula will be checked in some ( but sufficiently general ) cases .",
    "let us discus some of the obtained multi - knot configurations in details . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "6 the simplest eikonal knot with @xmath121 is presented .",
    "the position of the knot is given by a circle and this configuration possesses toroidal symmetry . in the same figure the case with @xmath157",
    "is demonstrated as well . as one could expect such a configuration consists of two elementary knots with @xmath158 ( circles ) which are linked together .",
    "the linking number is @xmath159 so this configuration has the total charge @xmath160 , what is in accordance with the formula ( [ linking ] ) .",
    "other multi - knot configurations built of the elementary knots with @xmath158 are plotted in fig . 7 ( @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) .",
    "one can easily check that ( [ linking ] ) is fulfilled as well .",
    "+ the more sophisticated case is shown in fig .",
    "8 , where a single knot solution for @xmath163 as well as for @xmath164 is presented . in contradistinction",
    "to the previously discussed knot this configuration does not have the toroidal symmetry ( of course , one can easily restore the toroidal symmetry by setting @xmath165 ) . in fig .",
    "9 further examples with @xmath166 and @xmath167 are shown .",
    "now , it is obvious how this type of knots ( i.e. with @xmath168 ) looks like .",
    "they cross @xmath169 times the @xmath170-plane , or in the other words they wrap @xmath171 times vertically on the torus @xmath148 .",
    "another configuration with two elementary knots is presented in fig .",
    "also in this case relation ( [ linking ] ) is satisfied - the corresponding linking number is @xmath172 and @xmath173 . in fig .",
    "11 a knot with @xmath174 is plotted .",
    "it is clearly visible that the knot is situated on a torus .",
    "another simple type of solutions can be obtained for @xmath175 .",
    "such knots with @xmath176 and @xmath177 are shown in fig .",
    "12 . here , the knot wraps @xmath171 times but in the horizontal direction on the torus i.e. around @xmath82-axis .",
    "knots with higher topological charges ( @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) are plotted in fig . 13 . in fig . 14 the simplest two - knot configuration of this type",
    "is demonstrated whereas in fig 15 one can find a solution with @xmath180 .",
    "it is straightforward to notice that , in spite of the fact that upper discussed knots belong to distinct topological classes , the curves describing their position are topological equivalent to a simple circle .",
    "+ more complicated and really knotted configurations have been found for @xmath181 , where @xmath182 are relative prime numbers distinct from one .",
    "the simplest trefoil knots with @xmath183 and @xmath184 are presented in fig .",

    "let us now consider the second simple case i.e. we take @xmath52 and put @xmath165 .",

    "additionally , one can observe that the hopf index of the central knot is @xmath202 .",
    "in fig . 19 the simplest types of solutions , with @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath203 , @xmath205 are demonstrated .",
    "we see that they are very similar to the corresponding solutions with @xmath46 ( see fig . 6 and fig .",
    "more complicated situations are plotted in fig .",
    "20 and fig . 21 . in all configurations",
    "the central knot is clearly visible as a circle around origin , whereas knots known form the previous subsection wrap around this central knot . +   + it is obvious to notice that presented solutions ( even one - knot configurations ) do not possess toroidal symmetry .",
    "surfaces of a constant value of the third component @xmath4 are not ( in general ) toruses . in this manner",
    "they differ profoundly from the standard knotted soliton configurations previously presented in the literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here , the position of a knot depends on a ( constant ) value of the radial coordinate @xmath99 as well as on the angular coordinates @xmath206 . up to our best knowledge non - toroidal knots",
    "have been not , in the exact form , presented in the literature yet .",
    "+ one has to be aware that all knots found in this paper are solutions of the complex eikonal equation only .",
    "it is not known any lagrangian which would give these multi - knot configurations as solutions of the pertinent equations of motion .",
    "they differ from toroidal solitons obtained recently in the aratyn - ferreira - zimerman ( and its generalizations ) and the nicole model .",
    "however , it is worth to notice that the simplest one knot state with @xmath207 @xmath208 is identical to the soliton with @xmath209 obtained in these models @xcite , @xcite . as we do not know the form of the lagrangian we are not able to calculate the energy corresponding to the obtained multi - knot solutions",
    "thus , their stability and saturation of the vakulenko - kapitansky inequality @xcite are still open problems .",
    "in spite of the upper mentioned problems our multi - knot configurations become more physically interesting , and potentially can have realistic applications , if one analyzes them in the connection with the faddeev - skyrme - niemi effective model of the low energy gluodynamics @xmath210 ^ 2 . \\label{fn}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to see that all finite energy solutions in this model must tend to a constant @xmath211 at the spatial infinity .",
    "then field configurations being maps from @xmath212 into @xmath213 can be divided into disconnected classes and characterized by the hopf index .",
    "indeed , many configurations with a non - trivial topological charge , which appear to form knotted structures have been numerically obtained @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ in order to reveal a close connection between the eikonal knots and faddeev - niemi hopfions we rewrite the equations of motion for model ( [ fn ] ) in terms of the complex field @xmath8 ( [ stereograf1 ] ) @xcite @xmath214 where @xmath215 it has been recently observed @xcite that such a model possesses an integrable submodel if the following constrain is satisfied @xmath216 then , infinite family of the local conserved currents can be constructed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , it is a well - known fact from the standard @xmath217 and @xmath5 soliton theory that the existence of such a family of the currents usually leads to soliton solutions with a non - trivial topology . due to",
    "that one should check whether also in the case of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model the integrability condition can give us some hints how to construct knotted solitons .",
    "+ for model ( [ fn ] ) the integrability condition takes the form @xmath218 it vanishes if mass is equal to zero or the eikonal equation is fulfilled .",
    "the first possibility is trivial since @xmath219 means the absence of the kinetic term in lagrangian ( [ fn ] ) and no stable soliton solutions can be obtained due to the instability under the scale transformation .",
    "thus , the eikonal equation appears to be the unique , nontrivial integrability condition for the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model .",
    "+ however , it should be stressed that the full integrable submodel consists of two equations .",
    "namely , apart from the integrability condition ( [ int cond1 ] ) , also the dynamical equation has to be taken into account @xmath220=0 .",
    "\\label{fn dyn eq}\\ ] ] the correct solutions of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model have to satisfy both equations . unfortunately , derived eikonal hopfions do not solve the dynamical equation and in the consequence are not solutions of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model . nonetheless , the fact that they appear in a very natural way in the context of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model i.e. just as solutions of the integrability condition might indicate a close relation between them and the faddeev - niemi hopfions .",
    "+ this idea seems to be more realistic if we compare the eikonal hopfions with the numerically found faddeev - niemi hopfions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is striking that every hopfions possesses its eikonal counterpart with the same topology and a very similar shape .",
    "+ moreover , there is an additional argument which strongly supports the idea that the eikonal knots might applied in construction of approximated faddeev - niemi hopfions .",
    "it follows from the observation that the eikonal knots , if inserted into the total energy integral calculated for the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model , give the finite value of this integral .",
    "the situation is even better .",
    "the lowest energy eikonal configurations are only approximately 20% heavier than numerically derived hopfions .",
    "let us show it for @xmath46 ansatz .",
    "+ indeed , the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model gives , for static configurations , the following total energy integral @xmath221 where the stereographic projection ( [ stereograf1 ] ) has been taken into account .",
    "moreover , as our solutions fulfill the eikonal equations @xmath222 thus @xmath223 now , we can take advantage of the eikonal hopfions and substitute them into the total energy integral ( [ energy fn2 ] ) .",

    "this minimization procedure should be done with respect to three ( in the case of @xmath46 ) parameters : @xmath231 and @xmath232 . at the beginning",
    "we get rid of the scale parameter",
    "@xmath231 @xmath233 then the total energy takes the form @xmath234 now , we calculate the previously defined integrals .",

    "+ now we are able to find the minimum of the total energy ( [ energy4 ] ) as a function of @xmath232",
    ". it has been done by means of numerical methods .",
    "the results @xmath242 for the simplest knots are presented in table 1 ( we assume @xmath243 ) .",
    "let us shortly comment obtained results .",
    "+ firstly , we see that the eikonal knots are heavier than knotted solitons found in the numerical simulations @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "it is nothing surprising as the eikonal knots do not fulfill the faddeev - skyrme - niemi equations of motion that is do not minimize the pertinent action .",
    "however , the difference is small and is more less equal 20% . strictly speaking",
    "the accuracy varies from 15% for the lightest knots with @xmath245 up to 30 - 35% in the case of knots with bigger value of @xmath246 or @xmath128 parameter .",
    "this result is really unexpected since the eikonal knots are solutions of such a very simple ( first order and almost linear ) equation .",
    "+ secondly , the lowest energy configurations are achieved for @xmath127 .",
    "as we know it means that a knot is located at @xmath247 . in other words , for fixed @xmath150 the unknot ( i.e. configurations where surfaces @xmath248 are toruses ) possesses lower energy than other knotted eikonal solutions .",
    "it is a little bit discouraging since the faddeev - niemi hopfions are in general really knotted solitons .",
    "however , one can observe that even very small increase of the energy @xmath249 causes that @xmath250 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "then , what is more important , also the ratio @xmath251 differs from zero significantly .",
    "it guarantees that the knotted structure of a eikonal solution becomes restored .",
    "+ thirdly , there is no @xmath252 degeneracy .",
    "the eikonal knots with @xmath253 and @xmath254 do not lead to the same total energy .",
    "in particular , for configurations with the fixed topological charge , the lowest energy state is a knot with @xmath245 . in the case of knots with bigger value of",
    "the parameter @xmath128 the total energy grows significantly .",
    "+ we see that the eikonal knots seem to be quite promising and can be applied to the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model . since",
    "our solutions possess a well defined topological charge and approximate the shape as well as the total energy of the faddeev - niemi hopfions with on an average 20% accuracy , one could regard them as first step in construction of approximated solutions ( given by the analytical expression ) to the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model .",
    "+ recently ward @xcite has analyzed the instanton approximations to faddeev - niemi hopfions with @xmath255 hopf index .",
    "it would be very interesting to relate it with the eikonal approximation .",
    "+ it should be noticed that similar construction provides approximated , analytical solutions in non - exactly solvable @xmath5 dimensional systems .",
    "in fact , the baby skyrme model @xcite and skyrme model in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite , @xcite can serve as very good examples .",
    "in this work multi - soliton and multi - knot configurations , generated by the eikonal equation in two and three space dimensions respectively , have been discussed .",
    "it has been proved that various topologically non - trivial configurations can be systematically and analytically derived from the eikonal equation .",
    "+ in the model with the two space dimensions ( which is treated here just as a toy model for the later investigations ) multi - soliton solutions corresponding to the @xmath6 sigma model have been obtained . in particular",
    ", we took under consideration one and two component ansatz i.e. @xmath256 . in this case",
    "we restored the standard result that the energy of a multi - soliton solution depends only on the total topological number .",
    "the way how the topological charge is distributed on the individual solitons does not play any role .",
    "thus , for example , the energy of a single soliton with winding number @xmath79 is equal to the energy of a collection of @xmath79 solitons with the unit charge . in both cases we observe saturation of the energy - charge inequality .",
    "moreover , energy remains constant under any changes of positions of the solitons .",
    "it is exactly as in the bogomolny limit where topological solitons do not attract or repel each other . due to that the whole moduli space has been found .",
    "+ in the most important , three dimensional space case we have found that the eikonal equation generates multi - knot configurations with an arbitrary value of the hopf index . as previously , ansatz ( [ anzatz ] ) with one and two components has been investigated in details .",
    "let us summarize obtained results . + using the simplest , one component ansatz ( [ anzatz ] ) we are able to construct one as well as multi - knot configurations which , in general , consist of the same ( topologically ) knots linked together .",
    "the elementary knot can have various topology .",
    "for example a trefoil knot has been derived .",
    "it is unlikely the standard analytical hopfion solutions which have always toroidal symmetry and are not able to describe such a trefoil state .",
    "+ by means of the two component ansatz multi - knot configurations with a central knot located at @xmath190 and a few satellite knots winded on a torus @xmath257 have been obtained . in the contrary to the central knot , which is always circle",
    ", satellite solitons can take various , topologically inequivalent shapes known from the @xmath46 case .",
    "+ in addition , we have argued that the multi - knot solutions can be useful in the context of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model .",
    "thus , they appear to be interesting not only from the mathematical point of view ( as analytical knots ) but might also have practical applications .",
    "we have shown that the eikonal knots provide an analytical framework in which the qualitative features of the faddeev - niemi hopfions can be captured . moreover ,",
    "also quantitative aspects i.e. the energy of the hopfion can be investigated as well .",
    "although the eikonal knots are approximately 20% heavier than the numerical hopfions , what is rather a poor accuracy in compare with the rational ansatz for skyrmions , one can expect that for other shape functions a better approximation might be obtained .",
    "+ there are several directions in which the present work can be continued .",
    "first of all one should try to achieve better approximation to the knotted solutions of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi effective model .",
    "it means that new , more accurate shape functions have to be checked .",
    "it is in accordance with the observation that presented here knots solve only the integrability condition ( eikonal equation ) but not the pertinent dynamical equations of motion . due to",
    "that it is not surprising that the eikonal shape function is an origin for some problems ( eikonal knots are too heavy and tend to unknotted configurations ) .",
    "one can expect that these new shape functions will not only better approximate the energy of the faddeev - niemi hopfions but also guarantee non - zero value of the parameter @xmath258 and ensure the knotted structure of the solutions .",
    "we would like to address this issue in our next paper .",
    "+ there is also a very interesting question concerning the shape of the eikonal hopfions .",
    "cores of all presented here knots are situated on a torus with a constant radius .",
    "however , there are many knots which can not be plotted as a closed curve on a torus",
    ". thus one could ask whether it is possible to construct such knots ( non - torus knots ) in the framework of the eikonal equation .",
    "+ of course , one might also apply the eikonal equation to face more advanced problems in the faddeev - skyrme - niemi theory and investigate time - dependent configurations as for instance scattering solutions or breather .",
    "+ on the other hand , one can try to find a lagrangian which possesses obtained here topological configurations as solutions of the corresponding field equations .",
    "one can for example consider recently proposed modifications of the faddeev - skyrme - niemi model which break the global @xmath6 symmetry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "application of the eikonal equation to other models of glueballs @xcite , @xcite , based in general on the @xmath85 field , would be also interesting .",
