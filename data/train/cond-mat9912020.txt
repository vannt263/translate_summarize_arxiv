    "the study of two - dimensional doped antiferromagnets is a central subject in quantum many - body theory .",
    "a plethora of interesting quantum ground states and quantum phase transitions appear possible , and the results have important experimental applications to the cuprate high temperature superconductors and other layered transition metal compounds .",
    "however the zoo of possibilities contributes to the complexity of the problem , and a widely accepted quantitative theory has not yet appeared .",
    "this paper will present a detailed quantum theory of some simpler realizations of doped antiferromagnets .",
    "we will consider situations in which it is possible to neglect the coupling between the spin and charge degrees of freedom and consider a theory of the spin excitations alone .",
    "more specifically , we have in mind the following physical systems , which are the focus of intense current experimental interest : ( a ) quasi - two dimensional ` spin gap ' insulators @xcite like @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 in which a small fraction of the magnetic transition metal ions ( cu or v ) are replaced by non - magnetic ions by doping with zn or li .",
    "these insulators have a gap to both charge and spin excitations , but the spin gap is significantly smaller than the charge gap , validating a theory of the spin excitations alone .",
    "moreover , additional low energy spin excitations are created in the vicinity of the dopant ions while charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed everywhere .",
    "( b ) high temperature superconductors like @xmath5 in which a small fraction of cu has been replaced by non - magnetic zn or li @xcite .",
    "a major fraction of the spectral weight of the spin excitiations near momentum @xmath9 resides in a spin-1 ` resonance peak ' at energy @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we present here a theory for the changes in this peak due to the doping by non - magnetic ions .",
    "it may appear surprising that we are able to model this phenomenon by a theory of the spin excitations alone , but we shall describe how this is possible : under suitable conditions , the coupling between the bosonic spin-1 mode responsible for the resonance peak , and the spin-1/2 fermionic , bogoliubov quasiparticles of the d - wave superconductor is weak and , in a sense we will make precise , irrelevant .",
    "( the alternative case in which the coupling to the quasiparticles is relevant is discussed in appendix  [ quasi] here we find that qualitative features of the theory and the structure of all the scaling forms remain unchanged , and there are only quantitative changes to scaling functions . )",
    "we will obtain a universal expression for the energy scale over which the resonance peak is broadened by non - magnetic ions , with the result depending only upon known bulk parameters .",
    "we also predict an unusual asymmetric lineshape for the broadened peak at low temperatures , and it would be interesting to test this in future experiments .",
    "related questions have been addressed in some earlier work .",
    "the impurity - induced damping of bulk excitations of an antiferromagnet was addressed in ref .",
    ": however , their analysis was restricted to the _ doublet _ spin - wave excitations of an ordered nel state well away from any quantum critical point ; our focus here is on the _ triplet _ excitations in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "a weak - coupling analysis of the effect of zn impurities on the spin fluctuation spectrum of a traditional bcs superconductor was considered in ref .  .",
    "an elementary introduction and a summary of our results , mainly for the uniform spin susceptibility , have appeared previously @xcite .",
    "although our results apply to disparate physical systems , they are unified by their reliance on a simple , new quantum field theory .",
    "we find it convenient to introduce this field theory at the outset , and will attempt to keep the discussion here self - contained and accessible to experimentalists .",
    "the discussion in this introduction will be divided into four subsections : section  [ host ] will review the quantum field theory for the host antiferromagnet , section  [ qimp ] will introduce the new quantum field theory of the impurity problem , our main results will be described in section  [ results ] , while the outline of the remainder of the paper appears in section  [ outline ] .",
    "we shall assume that the spin fluctuations in the host antiferromagnet , prior to doping by the zn or li ions , are described by the following o(3)-symmetric quantum theory @xcite of a three - component vector field @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 .",

    "the field @xmath19 represents the instantaneous , local orientation and magnitude of the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "so in applications to @xmath5 , @xmath20 represents the amplitude of spin fluctuations near wavevector @xmath9 .",
    "more generally , @xmath20 can represent collinear spin fluctuations at any commensurate wavevector , apart from wavevector @xmath21 .",
    "so states with significant ferromagnetic fluctuations are excluded , as are spiral states ( like those on the triangular lattice antiferromagnet ) which have non - collinear spin order .",
    "incommensurate , but collinear , spin correlations can be treated by a simple extension of the theory we consider here - this is discussed briefly in appendix  [ incomm ] .",
    "the quantum dynamics of @xmath20 is realized by the second - order time derivative term in @xmath22 ; we have rescaled the @xmath20 field to make the co - efficient of this term unity .",
    "notice that there is no first - order berry phase term , as is found in the path integral of a single spin : these are believed to efficiently average to zero on the scale of a few lattice spacings , because the orientation of the spins oscillates rapidly in the antiferromagnet . in one - dimensional antiferromagnets , this lattice scale cancellation is not quite perfect , and a topological ` @xmath23-term ' does survive @xcite ; however no such terms appear in two dimensions  the fate of the berry phases in the host antiferromagnet has been discussed at length elsewhere @xcite , and will not be important for our purposes here .",
    "the spatial propagation of the spin excitations is associated with the two spatial gradient terms , and we have allowed for two distinct spin - wave velocities , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , for propagation in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "such anisotropies are present in the coupled ` spin - ladder ' systems like @xmath6 .",
    "however , a simple redefinition of spatial co - ordinates @xmath28 allows us to scale away the anisotropy , and we shall assume this has been done in our subsequent discussion , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the resulting partition function has the form @xmath29 , \\label{sb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 we have also generalized the action to @xmath31 spatial dimensions for future convenience .",
    "the most important property of @xmath32 is that it exhibits a phase transition as a function of the coupling @xmath33 @xcite . for @xmath33 smaller than a critical value @xmath34 , the ground state has magnetic nel order and spin rotation invariance is broken because @xmath35 . for @xmath36 , spin rotation invariance is restored , and the ground state is a quantum paramagnet with a spin gap .",
    "the properties of this phase transition in @xmath32 are well understood , and we review a few salient facts .",
    "the nel state of @xmath22 is characterized by two spin stiffnesses , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , which measure the energy cost to slow twists in the direction of the nel order in the 1,2 directions respectively ( more precisely , a uniform twist by an angle @xmath23 over a length @xmath39 in the @xmath40 direction costs energy @xmath41 per unit volume ; note that @xmath42 has the dimension of energy in @xmath43 ) .",
    "these stiffnesses are related by @xmath44 for the isotropic model @xmath32 we have a single spin stiffness @xmath45 as @xmath33 approaches @xmath34 from below , the velocities @xmath24 and @xmath25 remain constant , while @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a known exponent .",
    "the quantum paramagnet for @xmath48 is characterized by its spin gap @xmath0 , and this vanishes as @xmath33 approaches @xmath34 from above as @xmath49    as has been discussed at length elsewhere @xcite , provided @xmath50 and @xmath18 are not too large , the energy scales @xmath0 and @xmath51 , and the velocities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , are sufficient to completely characterize the quantum dynamics of a @xmath43 antiferromagnet ; there is no need to have an additional parameter determining the strength of the quartic non - linearity @xmath52 because it reaches a universal value , determined by the zero of a renormalization group beta function , near the critical point .",
    "the present paper will establish the remarkable fact that _ no additional parameters _ are needed to characterize the spin dynamics in the presence of a dilute concentration of impurities . as we shall specify more explicitly below , we only need to know the concentration of impurities , @xmath2 , and for each impurity a spin @xmath3 , which is integer or half - odd - integer ; the value of @xmath3 can usually be determined , a priori , by simple arguments based upon gross features of the impurity configuration .",
    "many simple , physically relevant , lattice antiferromagnets can be explicitly shown to have a quantum phase transition described by @xmath32 .",
    "one of the most transparent is the coupled - ladder antiferromagnet , which has been much studied in recent work @xcite .",
    "we will consider such a model in section  [ ladders ] : the relationship to @xmath32 will emerge naturally , and we will also be able to relate parameters in @xmath32 to microscopic couplings .",
    "other models include the double - layer antiferromagnet @xcite , the antiferromagnet on the 1/5-depleted square lattice @xcite , and the square lattice antiferromagnet with frustration @xcite : our results will also apply to such antiferromagnets .",
    "the reader might wonder why we are placing an emphasis on the quantum phase transition in @xmath32 , while most experiments on zn or li doping have taken place in an antiferromagnet or superconductor with a well - defined spin gap .",
    "the reason is that the spin gap , @xmath0 , is often significantly smaller than the microscopic exchange interactions , @xmath53 . under such circumstances ,",
    "it is a poor approximation to model the spin gap phase in terms on tightly bound singlet pairs of electrons .",
    "rather , the smallness of the gap indicates that there is an appreciable spin correlation length and significant resonance between different pairings of singlet bonds .",
    "the approach we advocate to describe such a fluctuating singlet state is to find a quantum critical point to an ordered nel state somewhere in parameter space , and to expand away from it back into the spin gap phase .",
    "it is not necessary that the quantum critical point be experimentally accessible for such an approach to be valid : all that is required is that it be near a physically accessible point .",
    "the value of expanding away from the quantum critical point is that detailed dynamical information can be obtained in a controlled manner , dependent only upon a few known parameters .",
    "we now introduce _ arbitrary _",
    "localized impurities at a set of random locations @xmath54 with a density @xmath2 per unit volume .",
    "we place essentially no restrictions on the manner in which each impurity deforms the host antiferromagnet , provided the deformations are localized , immobile , well separated from each other , and preserve global su(2 ) spin symmetry . as we argue below , each impurity will be characterized only by a single integer / half - odd - integer , @xmath55 , which measures the net imbalance of berry phase in the vicinity of the impurity ; all other characteristics of the impurity will be shown to be strongly irrelevant .",
    "we mentioned the essentially complete cancellations of berry phases in the host antiferromagnet earlier in section  [ host ] ; this cancellation can be disrupted in the presence of an impurity @xcite , and it is only this disruption which will be important in the low energy limit .",
    "for instance , a single zn or li impurity introduces one additional spin on one sublattice than on the other , and so in a host spin-1/2 antiferromagnet such an impurity will have @xmath56 .",
    "as another example , consider a ferromagnetic rung bond in a spin-1/2 coupled ladder antiferromagnet : the two spins on the ends of the rung will be oriented parallel to each other and so their berry phases will add rather than cancel , leading to @xmath57 .",
    "the above criteria determining @xmath55 are qualitative , but we can make them more precise . place the host antiferromagnet in the quantum paramagnetic phase ( @xmath58 ) and measure the response to a uniform magnetic field . in the absence of impurities , the total linear susceptibility of the antiferromagnet , @xmath59 , can be written as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the total area of the antiferromagnet , @xmath62 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath63 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath64 is the response per unit area . as @xmath65 ,",
    "the response is exponentially small due to the presence of a spin gap , @xmath0 ; a simple argument summing over a dilute gas of thermally excited spin-1 particles shows that @xcite @xmath66 now let us add a very small concentration of impurities .",
    "the response @xmath59 is modified to @xmath67 \\ , .",

    "it is important to note that for any fixed @xmath2 , there is an exponentially small temperature below which the impurities do interact with each other , and ( [ chiimp ] ) is no longer valid : we have assumed that @xmath18 is above such a temperature in determining the @xmath55 .",

    "width=259 ]    it is worth emphasizing that @xmath76 is to be viewed as a long - wavelength theory for the impurity at site @xmath70 , and requires some interpretation when applied to lattice models .",
    "in particular when a non - magnetic zn or li impurity replaces a spin-1/2 cu ion , there is clearly no spin degree of freedom directly at the impurity site .",
    "instead the spin polarization is distributed in a staggered arrangement on the neighboring cu ions , so that the total moment is expected to be @xmath56 at @xmath83 ; this has been studied in elegant experiments @xcite , and we reproduce the results of one of these observations in fig .  [ stagg ] .",
    "the unit vector @xmath84 then measures the instantaneous orientation of the collective spin polarization which is centered on a non - magnetic zn site , and the berry phase in ( [ simp ] ) is the net uncompensated contribution obtained by summing over the berry phases of all the spins on the neighboring cu ions .",
    "the spatial correlations of the spins on the cu ions are encoded , in our theory , in those of the @xmath20 field .",
    "some crucial properties of the partition function @xmath80 in ( [ simp ] ) follow from simple power - counting arguments .",

    "a finite density of impurities , @xmath2 , is a relevant perturbation , but its impact is determined entirely by the single energy scale , @xmath115 , that can be constructed out of the above parameters , and that is also linear in @xmath2 : @xmath116 in particular , all dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the host antiferromagnet are modified only by _ a universal dependence on the ratio @xmath117 _ ; all corrections to these ( including those dependent on the magnitude of the bare coupling between the impurity and host antiferromagnet ) are suppressed by factors of @xmath118 , and only the latter are non - universal .",

    "such antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced in the vicinity of the impurity ( as in fig  [ stagg ] and refs .  ) , and should lead to increased stability of the resonance mode at higher temperatures .",
    "recent measurements of the effective moment on the zn site in @xmath676 at fairly large temperatures yield a value @xmath677 which is smaller than the value expected for @xmath678 , @xmath82 , @xmath679 . while some of this reduction is surely due to inter - impurity interactions , we speculate that the crossover to the quantum - critical region is playing a role . in the latter regime , we expect @xmath680 ; using the value in ( [ valc1 ] ) we obtain @xmath681 .    next , we discuss the relationship of our work to analyses of impurity effects in d - wave superconductors @xcite and a recent tunneling experiment@xcite .",
    "the former have all been carried out using actions closely related to @xmath682 ( in ( [ spsi],[spsiimp ] ) .",
    "however , we have argued in this paper that the coupling of the impurity spin to the collective , spin-1 , mode @xmath20 is a more relevant perturbation .",
    "one consequence of such a coupling is that the impurity spin has structure in its spectral function at frequencies which are integer multiples of @xmath0 , as we found in section  [ sec : n1 ] .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that some of this structure will appear also in the quasiparticle tunneling spectrum : it is interesting that a sideband at a frequency of order @xmath0 does appear to be present in the tunneling spectrum at the impurity site in ref .  .",
    "as we move away from the impurity site , the coupling between the quasiparticles and the @xmath20 mode becomes negligible , and the frequency @xmath0 should not be visible in tunneling  this also appears to be consistent with ref .  .",
    "we note that this sideband phenomenon is similar in spirit to arguments made by abanov and chubukov @xcite for photoemission experiments @xcite . also , some related computations on the relationship of tunneling spectra to antiferromagnetic collective modes appear in a recent work by chubukov _",
    "@xcite    in closing , we mention some consequences of our theory to ni doping of two - dimensional spin - gap compounds of spin-1/2 cu ions",
    ". each ni ion has spin-1 , and so the net uncompensated moment in its vicinity will still have @xmath683 .",
    "our theory , therefore implies that the damping of the bulk @xmath20 quasiparticle mode due to the ni impurities will be the same as that due to non - magnetic zn impurities , because both depend only the bulk parameters and the values of @xmath55 ; all differences arise only from irrelevant couplings and these are suppressed by factors of @xmath118",
    ". however , the atomic scale , staggered spin polarization will be very different in the two cases ; in particular , a large contribution to the net moment of @xmath112 comes from the magnetic moment on the ni ion itself , while no magnetic moment is present on the zn ions : this implies strong differences in the stm spectra .",
