    "the promising optoelectronic properties of spontaneously formed gan nanowires ( nws ) reported in the pioneering works of @xcite and @xcite have triggered world - wide research activities that have led to the demonstration of light - emitting @xcite and light - harvesting devices @xcite based on group - iii - nitride nws . despite this progress ,",
    "several open questions still exist regarding the spontaneous formation of gan nws and their structural and optical properties .",
    "in particular , a prominent band at 3.45  ev has been widely reported in the low - temperature photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of gan nws grown by plasma - assisted molecular beam epitaxy ( pambe ) on si(111 ) @xcite .",
    "the origin of this band in gan nws has been a subject of a lively debate for almost two decades . in bulk",
    "gan , two different recombination mechanisms are known to manifest themselves by luminescence lines at about 3.45  ev : first , the two - electron satellite ( tes ) of the donor - bound exciton transition [ @xmath0 @xcite and , second , excitons bound to inversion domain boundaries @xcite .    the intensity of the tes transitions in bulk gan is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the related @xmath1line @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the 3.45-ev band in gan nws is often prominent and sometimes even dominates the near band - edge pl spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , this band was ascribed to the tes by @xcite , who proposed that the distortion of the @xmath1wave function near the nw surface would lead to a strong enhancement of this transition .",
    "the same group substantiated this hypothesis by investigating the evolution of the 3.45-ev band with nw diameter and nw density @xcite .",
    "however , investigations of the fermi level pinning in gan nws @xcite as well as polarization - resolved pl and magneto - optical experiments @xcite later refuted the interpretation of the 3.45-ev band as an enhanced tes transition .",
    "inversion domain boundaries ( idbs ) may give rise to intense pl lines in gan films at 3.45  ev @xcite .",
    "an idb denotes a boundary between ga- and n - polar gan for which two different stacking sequences have been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the idb@xmath2notation refers to the specific atomic structure at which each atom remains fourfold coordinated by exclusively forming ga - n bonds across the boundary .",
    "in contrast , the unstarred idb indicates a structure where the formation of ga - ga or n - n bonds would occur .",
    "the idb@xmath2has an exceptionally low formation energy and does not induce electronic states in the band gap , thus facilitating the radiative recombination of excitons bound to these defects @xcite ( again in contrast to the unstarred idb , which entails electronic states in the band gap ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 3.45-ev band observed in pl spectra of gan nws is related to the presence of idb@xmath2sin gan nws just as in the bulk .",
    "this suggestion , however , was not supported by investigations of the microstructure of gan nws at that time .",
    "in fact , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) performed on isolated gan nws invariably demonstrated the absence of extended defects in the nw volume @xcite .",
    "several groups therefore favored point defects as the origin for the 3.45-ev emission .",
    "in early work , in which gan nws were assumed to elongate axially via a ga - induced vapor - liquid - solid mechanism , ga interstitials were proposed as likely candidates for these point defects @xcite .",
    "later , gan nw growth was understood to proceed under n - rich conditions , which were suggested to result in an enhanced formation of ga vacancies near the nw surface @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the dependence of the 3.45-ev band on excitation density in terms of both planar defects such as the idb@xmath2and abundant point defects and eventually favored the latter for being most consistent with the whole set of available data .",
    "however , the observation of strong nw - to - nw variations in the intensity of the 3.45-ev emission from single nws @xcite contradicted this conclusion as well .",
    "recently , @xcite presented definitive experimental evidence for the presence of idb@xmath2sin gan nws grown on aln - buffered si(111 ) .",
    "subsequently , the same authors correlated -pl experiments with high - resolution scanning tem performed on single gan nws grown on aln - buffered si @xcite .",
    "they observed a systematic correlation between the presence of idb@xmath2sin the gan nw and transitions at 3.45  ev in its -pl spectrum and thus concluded that these transitions are caused by exciton recombination at idb@xmath2s .",
    "finally , they proposed that the 3.45-ev band is indicative for the presence of idb@xmath2sin gan nws also for other substrates .",
    "it is not uncommon to observe mixed polarities in aln films grown on si(111 ) @xcite , and the coexistence of n- and ga - polar nws on such a film is therefore not an actual surprise . the spontaneous formation of gan nws directly on si(111 ) , however , is largely believed to occur on an amorphous sin@xmath3 interlayer formed during the ( unintentional or intentionally promoted ) nitridation of the si substrate by the n plasma @xcite .",
    "the polarity of gan nws formed directly on such a nitridated si(111 ) surface has been debated for a long time . in earlier work ,",
    "the gan nws were mostly reported to be ga polar @xcite , while recent studies ( which also include ensemble investigations with far better statitics ) indicate that gan nws grow predominantly or even exclusively n polar @xcite . in any case , whether idb@xmath2sform for gan nws on nitridated si(111 ) , and if so , at which density , are open questions .    in this paper , we report a comprehensive investigation of the structural and optical properties of gan nws on si(111 ) fabricated with or without intentional substrate nitridation and within a wide range of substrate temperatures .",
    "this investigation focuses on the nature of the 3.45-ev band that is observed for all samples but with varying intensity . in sec .",

    "we investigate whether this decrease in the relative @xmath9intensity with increasing @xmath4is correlated with changes in the morphology of the nw ensemble .",
    "furthermore , we examine the spatial distribution of the different spectral components for various nw ensembles .            figures  [ fig03-sem](a ) and [ fig03-sem](b ) display sem bird s eye view images of samples b4 and b1 , which were grown at @xmath10 and 720@xmath5c , respectively .",

    "the spatial distribution of the emission at 3.47 and 3.45  ev is the same as for sample b1 , as indeed for all samples exhibiting the morphology characteristic for growth at low substrate temperatures .    to clarify the reason for this spatial distribution , we have performed cbed as well as tem imaging on several nw samples grown at low @xmath4 . using cbed , it is straightforward to determine the polarity of the short nws constituting the columnar matrix in these nw ensembles , since their effective diameter is large due to the high degree of coalescence .",
    "the polarity of this matrix was found to be exclusively n polar for both samples b1 and c ( not shown here ) .",
    "for the long nws with diameters below 50  nm , the polarity can not be reliably determined by cbed . however , since we know the polarity of the columnar matrix , we can instead employ dark - field tem and exploit the fact that opposite polarities induce a contrast inversion in images recorded by this technique .",

    "these peculiar polarity core / shell nw structures seem to be identical to those observed in fig .",
    "[ fig01-pl - tem ] and in ref .  , suggesting that the mechanism giving rise to the formation of such structures is a general one and does not depend on the substrate .",
    "the long nws are either ga polar [ figs .",
    "[ fig05-tem](a ) and [ fig05-tem](b ) ] or have a core / shell structure with a ga - polar core surrounded by a n - polar shell [ figs .",
    "[ fig05-tem](c ) and [ fig05-tem](d ) ] . in the former case , planar idb@xmath2sare formed at the coalescence boundaries between the long ga - polar nws and the n - polar columnar matrix . in the latter case , the ga-/n - polar core / shell structure results in the formation of an idb@xmath2tube .",

    "the @xmath9doublet is dominated by the lower energy transition [ @xmath39 at 3.452  ev .",
    "however , with increasing excitation density [ fig .  [",
    "fig11_t - p - dependencies](a ) ] or temperature [ fig .",
    "[ fig11_t - p - dependencies](b ) ] , the higher energy transition [ @xmath40 takes over and eventually dominates the pl spectrum . at around 40  k ,",
    "carriers start to escape from the idb@xmath2 , which manifests itself in a quenching of the @xmath9doublet @xcite . as noted in ref .",
    ", the excitation power and temperature dependences of the @xmath9doublet are similar to the ones observed for the @xmath1and @xmath29transitions . in view of the fact that idb@xmath2sact as quantum wells",
    ", we thus attribute the high - energy line of the @xmath9doublet to the recombination of excitons free to move along the idb@xmath2plane and the low - energy one to excitons localized within this plane .",
    "localization within the plane of a quantum well usually occurs at well width fluctuations or due to alloy disorder @xcite , which clearly can not be the origin of the intra - idb@xmath2localization observed here .",
    "following the results reported for the localization of excitons in i@xmath41 basal - plane stacking faults @xcite , we propose that the short - range potential of shallow donors such as si and o distributed in the vicinity of the idb@xmath2induce the localization of excitons within the idb@xmath2plane .",
    "to confirm this idea , we compare the excitation dependence of the intensity ratio at 10  k between the @xmath42and @xmath43lines with that between the @xmath29and the @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig11_t - p - dependencies](c ) .",
    "both ratios remain nearly constant for low excitation powers , but increase together for powers higher than 18  w. this finding indicates that the density of localized states within the idb@xmath2sis comparable to the equivalent density of donors in nws and thus confirms that intra - idb@xmath2exciton localization occurs due to donors . note that we computed the characteristic extent of the exciton wavefunction perpendicular to the idb@xmath2plane to be 5  nm . assuming that the diffusion length of excitons in an idb@xmath2is 100  nm @xcite , a donor density of 10@xmath44  @xmath45 is found to be sufficient to localize excitons within the idb@xmath2plane , a value close to those reported for unintentionally @xmath46-doped gan nws @xcite .    in ensemble measurements",
    ", the @xmath43band typically has a line width of several mev , whereas single nws exhibit numerous sharp lines in this region @xcite .",
    "the small differences in transition energies originate from the varying distances between the involved donor and the idb@xmath2plane @xcite .",
    "this effect can also be seen very clearly for sample a in fig .",
    "[ fig01-pl - tem ] . due to the low nw density of @xmath47  @xmath12 of this sample , only a small number of nws",
    "is probed simultaneously , and the individual narrow lines can be resolved even in an ensemble measurement . the line width of the sharp @xmath43lines in fig .",
    "[ fig01-pl - tem ] and also in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "is resolution limited , demonstrating that these lines stem from the radiative decay of bound excitons .",
    "in contrast , ensemble spectra such as the ones shown in figs .  [ fig10-doublets ] and [ fig11_t - p - dependencies ] contain contributions from about @xmath48 nws , and the individual transitions can no longer be resolved , but blend together to an @xmath43band with a line width of several mev @xcite . note that @xcite observed a fine structure of the @xmath9band in bulk gan already in 2001 .",
    "the @xmath42band exhibits a linewidth of a few mev as expected for delocalized states .    finally , we have performed time - resolved pl experiments to obtain quantitative information on the capture efficiency of excitons by idb@xmath2sand on the intra - idb@xmath2localization process .",
    "figure  [ fig12_trpl ] shows pl transients of sample b6 measured at 10  k for the @xmath29and @xmath1transitions as well as for the @xmath42and @xmath43lines .",
    "while the initial increase of the @xmath29pl intensity is almost instantaneous , it takes 90  ps for the @xmath1pl intensity to reach a maximum .",
    "the latter time corresponds roughly to the characteristic time for the capture of excitons by donors with a density of about @xmath49  @xmath45 @xcite . in agreement with the results reported in ref .  , the @xmath29and @xmath1pl decay in parallel at longer times as a result of the quasi - thermalization between these exciton states . using an exponential fit , the effective decay time for the @xmath29and @xmath1is found to be 195  ps , very similar to values obtained in previous reports @xcite .",
    "this decay is much faster than expected for the radiative decay of the @xmath1complex and is due to the nonradiative decay of the @xmath29at point defects @xcite .",
    "analogously to the @xmath1and @xmath29transitions , the initial increase of the @xmath43intensity is delayed compared to that of the @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , the rise time of the @xmath42intensity is only 47  ps .",
    "therefore , the capture of excitons by idb@xmath2sis more efficient than their trapping by neutral donors due to the idb@xmath2s large capture cross - section .",
    "this situation differs from observations for the rise time of the @xmath35transition at 10  k @xcite , which is limited by the inefficient transport of excitons from one donor to the next @xcite . for time delays longer than 600  ps , the @xmath43and @xmath42decay in parallel , again demonstrating quasi - thermalization between these states .",
    "finally , for time delays longer than 1  ns , the pl decay of the coupled @xmath29and @xmath1states slows down and asymptotically approaches that of the @xmath9doublet ( not shown ) , indicating full thermalization between the @xmath29 , @xmath1and @xmath9states .",
    "this process is the origin of the biexponential pl decay reported for the @xmath1 in refs .  .    and @xmath29transitions as well as of the @xmath43and @xmath42lines of sample b6",
    "the arrows denote the respective rise times , and the solid lines are exponential fits . ]",
    "the 3.45-ev band observed in low - temperature pl and cl spectra of spontaneously formed gan nws on si(111 ) arises from planar or tubular idb@xmath2s . while the former are due to the coalescence of adjacent ga- and n - polar nws , the latter form at the interface of ga-/n - polar core / shell nws .",
    "the intensity ratio between the @xmath9and the @xmath1transitions decreases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this decrease is a consequence of the reduction in the density of nonradiative point defects with increasing @xmath4 , leading to an increase in the absolute intensity of the @xmath1line .",
    "in contrast , the absolute intensity of the @xmath9band is neither directly governed by @xmath4nor by the presence or absence of an intentional nitridation step .",
    "the same applies to the abundance of idb@xmath2sobserved in spatially resolved , bichromatic cl maps .",
    "these results confirm the idea of @xcite that the 3.45-ev luminescence band in gan nws signifies the presence of idb@xmath2sregardless of the substrate .",
    "in fact , we now know with certainty that idb@xmath2soccur in gan nw ensembles synthesized by pambe on aln - buffered si(111 ) @xcite , on nitridated si(111 ) , and on sic(0001 ) .",
    "the exceptionally low formation energy of idb@xmath2sis obviously an important factor promoting their frequent occurrence .",
    "however , a prerequisite for the formation of an idb@xmath2is the simultaneous presence of both ga- and n - polar material . at present , it remains entirely unclear why an apparently constant fraction of the gan nuclei on all of these different substrates are ga polar . we also do not understand how ga - polar nws can evolve from these nuclei despite our inability to synthesize them intentionally on cation - polar substrates @xcite and at substrate temperatures at which gan(0001 ) usually decomposes . finally , it is unclear how the peculiar ga-/n - polar core / shell nws form , which have been observed by different groups and on different substrates .",
    "the lack of knowledge regarding these apparently universal and basic phenomena demonstrates that the nucleation and formation of gan nws in pambe are still far from being completely understood .",
    "concerning the electronic and optical properties of idb@xmath2s , it is helpful to imagine them as a thin type - ii quantum well that binds holes . the coulomb attraction exerted by these holes is strong enough to bind electrons , and the resulting @xmath9state decays radiatively and thus gives rise to intense light emission . the change in the symmetry of the fundamental hole state in",
    "idb@xmath2sstrongly modifies the polarization and the behavior of the @xmath9when subjected to magnetic fields .",
    "donor atoms distributed in the vicinity of the idb@xmath2plane localize the exciton within the idb@xmath2plane . as a result of this localization",
    ", the @xmath9band resolves into a doublet with the lines at low and high energy being associated with localized and free @xmath9states , respectively .",
    "their excitonic nature is manifested by the observation of a fine structure of the low energy line consisting of sharp , resolution - limited peaks . finally , while the capture of excitons by idb@xmath2stakes less than 50  ps , quasi - thermalization between the near - band edge excitons and the @xmath9takes much longer , resulting in the nonexponential decay usually observed for the @xmath1transition in gan nws at low temperatures .",
    "analogously to stacking faults @xcite , idb@xmath2sdo not suffer from fluctuations in layer thickness or composition as conventional quantum wells and thus offer unique possibilities for the study of low - dimensional excitons @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting in this context are the tubular idb@xmath2sformed in ga-/n - polar core / shell nws and intersections of these tubular idb@xmath2swith stacking faults forming perfect crystal - phase quantum rings . since the electronic states associated with all of these quantum structures are shallow @xcite , they should be of little practical relevance for conventional devices",
    ". however , we envisage that their exceptionally well - defined properties make them ideal model systems for an understanding of quantum effects important for a future generation of optoelectronic devices .",
