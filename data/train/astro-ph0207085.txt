    "we are actively searching for such ` minority ' populations ( kim & elvis 1999 ) .",
    "we have found an interesting high fraction of extreme x - ray loud sources ( @xmath4% ) among the _ rosat _ high galactic latitude sources at all fluxes : ( this paper , bade et al . 1995 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ) . here",
    "we designate as ` blank field sources ' or ` blanks ' all the bright _ rosat _ pspc ( position sensitive proportional counter ) x - ray sources ( @xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 ) with no optical counterpart on the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) ( to o=21.5 ) within their @xmath8 ( 99% ) radius error circle .",
    "for comparison , at these x - ray fluxes a normal type 1 agn should appear on the poss some 3.5 magnitudes brighter ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the nature of these sources has never been systematically investigated before , and their nature is still mysterious .",

    "the only known class of x - ray emitting objects that can reach such extreme are bl lacertae objects , which can have @xmath14 up to @xmath20 ( maccacaro et al .",

    "we briefly describe these below .",
    "`` normal '' bl lacs are expected for @xmath21 ( e.g. maccacaro et al .",
    "1988 ) , but given the range of @xmath14 spanned by blanks more extreme bl laces , with the sed peaking at energies higher than the _ rosat _ band are needed .",
    "this peak could be either the low energy ( synchrotron ) or the high energy ( inverse compton ) one shifted appropriately .",
    "fossati et al ( 1998 ) show that these two peaks do shift systematically with luminosity . in the first case , these indeed would be faint bl lacs , with the synchrotron peak at @xmath22 kev ; some such extreme bl lacs have been found recently by e.g. costamante et al .",
    "no examples of blazars with an inverse compton peak lying in the 1 - 10 kev range are known so far , but the study of _ rosat _ could potentially discover them .",
    "blank field sources could be identified with old isolated neutron stars ( ins ) or isolated black holes ( ibh ) , which could be observable due to accretion from the interstellar medium ( `` accretors '' ) .",
    "ins can also be visible in the soft x - ray band when they are young and hot ( `` coolers '' ) due to thermal emission of their hot surface ( e.g. treves et al . 2000 ; popov et al .",
    "old ins are expected to have @xmath23 ( maoz , ofek & shemi , 1997 ) . and extremely soft x - ray spectra and emission in the uv .",
    "the active search for ins has produced 7 strong candidates ( stocke et al .",
    "1995 ; walter , wolk & neuhauser 1996 ; haberl et al . 1997 ; haberl , motch & pietsch 1998 ; schwope et al . 1999 ; motch et al .",
    "1999 , haberl , pietsch & motch 1999 ; zampieri et al .",

    "the large initial velocity found for one of these sources ( @xmath24 km s@xmath7 found by walter ( 2001 ) for rx  j1856 - 3754 ) supports the `` cooler '' origin , while no proof of the existence of `` accreting '' old ins has been found .",
    "being nearby ins and ibh ( @xmath25 pc ) will be quasi - isotropically distributed on the sky .",
    "the predicted number counts for old ins are highly uncertain , ranging from @xmath26deg@xmath27 ( madau & blaes 1994 ) to much smaller values ( e.g. colpi et al .",

    "normal type 1 agns with @xmath5   have @xmath9 .",
    "obscured agns could appear as blanks if their o - band absorption is @xmath28  mag , which corresponds to a local @xmath29  @xmath6 .",
    "possibilities for absorbed agns with @xmath30 in the _ rosat _ pspc are :      qso-2s would be high luminosity , high redshift , heavily obscured quasars , the bright analogs of the well known seyfert  2s at @xmath31 .",
    "qso-2s and low mass seyfert-2 ( lmsy2 ) galaxies are the `` missing links '' of the unifying models of agn ( urry & padovani 1995 ) and their existence is still debated ( e.g. halpern , turner & george 1999 ) .",
    "a large number of qso-2s is also postulated by the models of synthesis of the x - ray background above 2 kev to reproduce the observed number counts at bright fluxes ( comastri et al .",
    "2001 , gilli , salvati & hasinger 2001 ) .",
    "thus a knowledge of their number density is fundamental to our understanding of the x - ray sky and should be the site where a large fraction of the energy of the universe is generated ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; elvis , risaliti & zamorani , 2002 ) .    in spectral terms we would expect : ( a ) strong optical reddening ; ( b ) soft x - ray absorption ; ( c ) recovery of the x - ray intrinsic emission in the pspc energy range . qso-2s should then have flat pspc spectra and an observed @xmath14 enhanced by the redshift k - correction . for moderate absorbing columns ( @xmath32 @xmath6 ) qso-2s would be visible in the pspc because their redshift has the effect of lowering the observed absorption",
    "; for higher column densities the direct emission could be completely absorbed , but a scattered component could still allow the source detection .    in order to quantify the expected x - ray properties , we simulated these two qso-2 scenarios assuming , for the moderately absorbed case , a rest frame absorbed ( @xmath33 @xmath6 ) power law model ( @xmath34 ) at z=1.0 with an unabsorbed @xmath35 erg s@xmath7 .",

    "lmsy  2 are seyfert  2 galaxies powered by a relatively low mass obscured black hole ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "these would be the obscured analogs of the narrow line seyfert 1s .",
    "their low mass would shift the peak of the big blue bump ( bbb ) disk emission ( @xmath46 ) around 100 ev . as a result",
    "their spectra would be enhanced in the soft x - ray band and suppressed in the optical .",
    "re  1034 + 396 ( puchnarewicz et al . 1995 ; 2001 ) shows that this does indeed occur in nlsy  1 .",
    "we simulated the lmsy2 case assuming an absorption of @xmath47 @xmath6 , a thermal component of kt = 150 ev , a power law with @xmath48 .",
    "we normalized the model to have a ratio between the thermal and power law component matching what observed in narrow line sy  1s ( nicastro , fiore & matt , 1999 ) and to have an unabsorbed luminosity at z=0.002 of @xmath49 erg  s@xmath7 . the simulated lmsy2 is detected in the _ rosat _ pspc with a count rate of 0.015 counts s@xmath7 corresponding to a 0.5 -2.4 kev flux of @xmath50 .",
    "thus obscuration , even by large amounts of molecular matter and cold gas ( @xmath51 @xmath6 ) , would still allow the detection of the soft x - ray source emission because it is so intrinsically strong , but would harden the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "virtually all type  1 agns have optical - ultraviolet spectra dominated by the bbb component from the accretion disk ( malkan & sargent , 1982 ; elvis & lawrence , 182 ; elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) there are however radiatively inefficient mechanisms for accretion .",
    "an example of this are ` advection dominated accretion flows ' ( adafs ) ( e.g. narayan & yi , 1994 ) , where most of the energy is stored in the gas and advected toward the hole and only a small fraction is radiated . the result is a suppression of the optical - uv - euv bbb emission ( see figure  1 of narayan et al .",

    "2001a , stanford et al . 2001 ) .",

    "the lensing mass did not show up in deep optical / ir imaging , while follow - up x - ray observations detected a @xmath59 cluster ( hattori et al .",
    "1997 ) . although _ chandra _ and deeper optical searches found that the properties of the cluster axj2019@xmath01127 are not so extreme as previously thought ( chartas et al .",
    "2001 ) , if dark clusters exist , they could be found among blanks .      a failed cluster would be a large overdensity of matter in the form of diffuse gas only .",
    "galaxies have to form from clouds of gas with cooling time shorter than the hubble time .",
    "this implies a protogalactic mass @xmath60 ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 and references therein ) ; in principle more massive clouds , with a longer cooling might have never collapsed to form stars in appreciable number .",
    "the result would be a large cloud of gas with no visible galaxies .",
    "+ their possible existence and number - density is connected to the efficiency of galaxy formation , which potentially constrains a number of issues such as : the spectrum of the fluctuations that gave rise to galaxies , the baryonic or non - baryonic nature of dark - matter , the value of @xmath56 and the relative distribution of dark and baryonic matter ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) .",
    "the discovery of even only one failed cluster among our blanks would pose serious difficulties for the hierarchical clustering formation , which does not predict their existence .",
    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) are objects observed in nearby galaxies , usually off the galactic center , with luminosity exceeding the eddington limit for isotropic emission of a 1.4 @xmath61 star ( i.e. @xmath62 up to @xmath63 , e.g. fabbiano 1898 ; makishima et al . 2000",
    "; zezas et al . 2002 ; colbert & ptak 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the ulx nature is still not understood and the most plausible explanations are : sub - eddington binaries involving massive black holes ( @xmath64 ) or binary systems with emission collimated toward our line of site ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) or relativistically beamed systems ( microquasars ) .",
    "these models imply an high @xmath65 because the optical emission is related to the companion star .",
    "also x - ray binaries and cataclismic variables are known to display high x - ray over optical flux ratios and could be candidate blanks if present in an uncrowded optical region of a nearby galaxy .",
    "x - ray bursts are short lived x - ray flares , which may be afterglows of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "popular grbs scenarios such as binary coalescence of compact stars ( e.g. janka & ruffert , 1996 ) or collapsars ( e.g. hartmann & macfadyen , 1999 ) predict collimated flows , which should lead to collimated bursts and afterglow emission .",
    "if afterglows turn out to be less beamed than grbs , then we expect to find a higher rate of afterglows than grbs depending on the beaming angles .",
    "this possibility can be tested with a search for afterglows fortuitously detected during _ rosat _ pspc pointings ( e.g. greiner et al . 2000 for a systematic search in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , rass ) .",
    "the _ rosat _ lightcurves of afterglows could also constrain the x - ray flux decaying rate , which can be compared with the power law slope of @xmath66 seen for the brighter _ beppo - sax _ afterglows ( frontera et al . 2000 ) .",
    "another class of variable sources are normal galaxies which exhibit x - ray flares , probably related to the tidal distruption of a star near the central black hole ( e.g. bade , k. , d. , 1996 ) . in the x - ray high - state , these galaxies exceed their quiescent by up to several orders of magnitude .",
    "timescales for the duration of the x - ray high - state are not yet well constrained ; they may range from months to years .",
    "blanks candidates also include variable sources , such as blazars or cataclismic variables , which were caught in outburst during the _ rosat _ observations , but were quiescent in the poss epoch , some 40 years earlier .      quite possibly the class of contains examples of several , or all , of these objects . the possibility of identifying blanks with sources listed above makes the study of this minority population a subject of primary importance in cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "as we will show , it is possible to make significant progress and distinguish among many of these options even without new observations , using only archival data .",
    "to define our sample of ` blank field sources ' we searched the _ rosat _ pspc `` wgacat95 '' ( or simply ` wgacat ' , white giommi & angelini 1995 ) , a catalog containing a total of @xmath67 sources generated from _ rosat _",
    "pspc pointed observations using a sliding cell detect algorithm .",
    "we used the following selection criteria :    1 .",
    "bright x - ray sources , with @xmath30 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 ; 2 .   well detected , with a signal to noise ratio greater than 10 and a quality flag greater than 5 ; 3 .   high galactic latitude ( @xmath68 ) ; 4 .   not within @xmath69 of the target position ( at which point the source density reaches the background level ) to select only random , serendipitous sources ; 5 .",

    "unidentified , with wgacat class= 9999 and no simbad or nasa extragalactic database identification .",
    "the first six criteria selected 1624 sources ( @xmath72% of the total ) . since these sources were selected purely on their x - ray properties , they form a well defined sample from which to study the incidence of minority x - ray populations . adding the requirement that a source has to be unidentified left 940 objects . we than searched the apm catalog for sources without any optical counterpart in the o filter ( to o=21.5 ) in a radius of @xmath73 , which corresponds to about 95% confidence for x - ray sources within @xmath74 of the pspc detector center ( boyle et al .",

    "] of containing a source by chance .",
    "this implies that many other pspc sources might be ` blanks ' if we had a smaller uncertainty on the x - ray positions .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "hri , thanks to its smaller positional uncertainty , would have been a better choice for the selection of blanks , but no hri catalogs were available when this project was initiated .",
    "this gave 81 sources .",
    "after visual inspection 10 of these sources proved to be false due to limitations of the detection algorithm : there can be false detections near bright sources or detections close to the inner circle boundary due to the spread of a bright source falling in the outer circle . the final sample is thus composed of 71 sources .",
    "however careful inspection showed that some of the 71 _ rosat _ fields had wgacat coordinates not in agreement with other position estimates and in some cases the displacement was larger than the @xmath73 radius error circle used for the cross - correlation .",
    "some of our blanks had no optical counterparts because of the wrong x - ray positions .",
    "this shift in wgacat coordinates is related to an error in converting the header of the old format event files into rdf format ; this error caused an offset in the source declination up to 1@xmath79 .",
    "these problems were solved in the newly released revision.2 _ rosat _ pspc data , available in the heasarc database .      in order to quantify how many sources had wgacat coordinates with an offset @xmath80 we used the incomplete galpipe catalog ( fabbiano et al . in preparation ) and found improved revision.2 coordinates for 54 of the 71 objects ( 76% of the sample ) . out of these , 39 had a shift between wgacat and galpipe positions smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "( note that even if @xmath81% of the sources in our sample have an offset @xmath82 only 431 observations out of 3644 ( @xmath83% ) in wgacat were affected by this problem . )",
