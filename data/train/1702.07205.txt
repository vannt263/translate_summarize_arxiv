    "consistency in preferences ( by pairwise comparisons ) can be traced to @xcite , published by kendall and smith in 1939 . by 1976 , there were four articles listed in @xcite , with the inconsistency in the title . in @xcite , the consistency index ( ci ) was introduced .",
    "many other definitions followed .",
    "all of them attempt to answer the most important question : how far have we departed from the consistent state which is well established by the consistency condition illustrated in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] in this text .",
    "briefly , every cycle of three interrelated comparisons : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 must be reducible to two comparisons , since the third comparison is a result of multiplication or division of these two comparisons .",
    "for example , given @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 should be equal to @xmath4 . if @xmath1 and @xmath3 are given , @xmath2 is equal to @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given , @xmath1 is equal to @xmath6 . no other combination exists for a cycle of three comparisons .",
    "if all three ratios are given , inconsistency in such cycle may take place and usually , it does .",
    "earlier definitions of inconsistency were based on the total count of inconsistent triads .",
    "evidently , such cardinal inconsistency was imprecise .",
    "this study proposes to regard the inconsistency in pairwise as a degree or extent of disagreement modeled on the concept of probability measure .",
    "our study also demonstrates a problem shown in @xcite , where the normalization was not used .",
    "the interval @xmath0 $ ] ( or discrete values between 0 and 1 ) is used in many theories and situations including :    * probability , * multi - valued logic ( as proposed by lukasiewicz ) , * fuzzy logic , * rough set theory , * theory of evidence .    [ use01 ]    there are also a number of zero - one laws of which the convergence of conditional expectations , known as `` lvy s zero-one law , '' can be summarized as `` if we are learning gradually all the information that determines the outcome of an event , then we will become gradually certain what the outcome will be , '' which has application to the consistency - driven pairwise comparisons ( recently used in @xcite , but based on inconsistency indicator introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "the important interpretation of `` lvy s zero-one law '' is `` the gradual data gathering to determine the outcome of an event , then we will become gradually certain what the outcome will be '' since it has the direct application to the reduction of inconsistency in pairwise comparisons    according to @xcite , p. lvy proved in 1937 ( see @xcite ) , that kolmogorov s theorem follows from a more general property of conditional probabilities , which says that + @xmath7    almost certainly equals 0 or 1 ( depending on whether @xmath8 is zero or not ) .",
    "the use of interval @xmath0 $ ] for inconsistency indicators is not only coming from the occam s razor principle .",
    "the section  [ sec:3 ] shows that the lack of normalization in @xcite leads to problems which this study attempts to correct . in this study",
    ", we will follow a business principle `` change a problem into opportunity '' and use it not only to correct @xcite but to reason for an important axiom .",

    "[ fig : diagram1 ] illustrates the interpretation the inconsistency indicator as the area of the `` triangle '' which is reduced to the line for the consistent case .",
    "it is easy to see that the inconsistency for a triad @xmath28 , defined in @xcite and finally simplified to @xmath55 in @xcite , does not suffer the above problem since the distance @xmath56 is normalized and converges to 0 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this may be an example for the need of normalization for applications since the distance normalization seems to be indispensable for the inconsistency indicator definition .",
    "the need for a normalized rating scale for pairwise comparisons has been shown in @xcite .",
    "the lack of the rating scale normalization leads to a paradox .",
    "similarly , the use of `` central tendency '' in the inconsistency indicator definition leads to deviations as demonstrated in @xcite ( section 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the two counter - examples and mathematical reasoning were provided that eigenvalue - based inconsistency , used in some customizations of pairwise comparisons , has no mathematical validity since it tolerates arbitrarily large errors when the size of a pc matrix increases to the infinity .",
    "our reasoning can not be interpreted as `` normalization will fix it all '' since not every normalized distance can be used as inconsistency indicator , but whatever inconsistency indicator is defined , it has to be normalized for the reasons listed in the section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "evidently , the list of reasons is , in all likeliness , incomplete , but sufficient to normalize all inconsistency indicators .",
    "there is no question that we need to make risky moves in the absence of hard evidence and `` stipulative '' ( more relevant term : `` speculative '' ) definitions may be proposed .",
    "however , such definitions should be clearly labeled so other researchers could be alerted and look for a validation or fallacy of such definitions .",
    "the theory , based on stipulative foundations , which are not properly labeled , becomes hard to invalidate as time passes and the progress of science suffers .",
    "one may only imagine that the eignevalue - based inconsistency in @xcite was `` stipulative '' since it was invalided in @xcite ) in 2014 .",
    "definition 3.6 in @xcite could also be regarded as a stipulative definition .",
    "however , it was not labeled ( or otherwise indicated ) as `` stipulative''in the text . the assumption that a generalized distance can be used as a map for inconsistency indicators was arbitrary ,",
    "not rooted in the deep knowledge of pairwise comparisons , and unverified by real life examples . not only is it corrected by this study , but has facilitated the discovery of the need for normalization which is a paradigm shift in the research of the inconsistency in pairwise comparisons .",
    "it is worth to notice that all coefficients of @xmath17 have the limit @xmath57 hence we may wonder whether or not such limit is attainable . observe that infinity is not a number and was rejected by the intuitionistic mathematics that was advocated by l.e.j .",
    "as it turns , the existence of infinity can not be proved and it needs to be postulated ( something that many of us often overlook to do ) .",
    "one of the philosophical issues of applied mathematics is the approximation theory of real numbers .",
    "most transcendental real numbers can not be described since the set of transcendental real numbers is not countable , while a picture of one number after another can only show a countable set of numbers . evidently , at various degrees of knowledge and applications , the idealized framework of mathematics may be questioned by the the common sense with regards to the lack of effectiveness and/or feasibility of obtained results .",
    "the normalization has become so popular ( especially in the applied science ) that it s impossible to trace its origins .",
    "however , the probability is the high suspect , since it was already used ( in its embryonic and partially mystic way ) by cardano , who was a gambler , in the 14th century .",
    "the probability has involved into one of the most powerful scientific methods universally used in most branches of applied and many theoretical sciences .",
    "the normalization in probability theory is related to two of three axioms proposed by kolmogorov in 1933 hence it is of a considerable importance .",
    "however , normalization might have been in use for a few centuries . according to @xcite ,",
    "the acceptance of kolmogorov s axiomatization was not instantaneous but took tens of years ( some researchers still try to relax some of his axioms ) .",
    "the issue of normalization leads to the non - trivial mathematical theory of boundedness and bornology in @xcite and in @xcite is related to compactification . a mathematical object @xmath46 such as a set or function",
    "is _ bounded _ , provided that @xmath46 has a value such that all members of the set or function are less than this bound .",
    "for example , the set of points in the half closed , half open interval @xmath58 are bounded above by 1 .",
    "again , for example , the function @xmath59 is bounded above by 1 .",

    "for instance , let @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath63 is a topological space that is not compact , since @xmath63 has no finite subcover .",
    "again , the set of all subsets of a geodetic line the plane is not compact for the same reason .",
    "let @xmath11 be a non - compact space and let @xmath68 be a point that does not lie in @xmath11 .",
    "the next step is to take a non - compact space @xmath11 and modify it to make it compact .",
    "the result is a _ compactification _ of @xmath11 ( see , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",

    "acting in this spirit of the probability axioms , we postulate the lower and upper bounds for inconsistency indicator as : @xmath72 without the loss of generality .",
    "unlike probability , inconsistency indicators do not need to reach the upper bound value .",
    "it reflects the reality that no one can be indefinitely inconsistent with some exceptions such as `` 0 - 1 '' inconsistency indicator with 0 for all consistent triads and 1 otherwise .",
    "evidently , @xmath73 for @xmath28 can not ever have a value of 1 since neither @xmath53 nor @xmath51 can be 0 ( @xmath22 are ratios hence must be strictly positive ) .",

    "there are a number of reasons why the interval @xmath78 is not as good as @xmath79 $ ] but the most important reason is that the first half of @xmath78 is still @xmath78 . in practice ,",
    "the inconsistency in pairwise comparisons is unavoidable unless we decide to use the simplified version of pairwise comparisons as described in @xcite with the minimum of @xmath80 comparisons of so - called principal generators which allow us to compute the rest of pc matrix elements from the consistency condition ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "when inconsistency exists ( and it is nearly always as previously noticed ) , its degree is of great importance for the level of tolerance similar to @xmath82value in statistics .",
    "the @xmath82value interpretation is the probability that , using a given statistical model , the statistical summary is less than or equal to the chosen significance level ( @xmath83 ) than the actual observed results ( e.g. , the difference between mean values of two compared groups ) .",

    "recently , it was simplified in @xcite to :    @xmath90    the equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) has an equivalent form @xmath91 + a different ( and a bit unusual ) type of normalization is needed to prevent a rating scale paradox ( addressed in @xcite ) .",
    "+ the original title of this section was `` why @xmath0 $ ] ? ''",
    "but , after intensive study , it was changed to reflect the reality in the applied science .",
    "it is mostly pure mathematics and theoretical physics where @xmath41 reigns although the speed limit is observed even in the theoretical physics .",
    "using @xmath41 in proofs is not only highly desirable but often necessary .",
    "however , variables of the indicators type are easier to process when they are normalized .",
    "for this reason , using [ 0,1 ] should be a rule .",

    "the best way is to avoid inconsistency as much as possible .",
    "sometimes , it is possible as @xcite demonstrates .",
    "a decision maker may choose to provide just @xmath92 pairwise comparisons , which must be `` principal generators '' ( e.g. , located just above or below the main diagonal and other strategic places specified in @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining pc matrix elements can be reconstructed so the entire pc matrix is consistent . using more than @xmath92 pairwise comparisons may ( and usually does ) lead to inconsistency , which is hard to manage without the use of heuristics .",
    "however , avoidance of inconsistency has a reflection in the use of artificial levees in the river management .",
    "when the artificial levee is breached , the damage to properties and lives can be greater than flooding which occurs without an artificial levee constructed .",
