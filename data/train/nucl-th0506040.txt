    "in the study of the properties of dense matter and search for quark gluon plasma in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , jet quenching @xcite or the suppression of leading high @xmath0 hadrons @xcite has become a powerful diagnostic tool .",
    "the theoretical concept relies on the study of parton propagation in medium and induced radiative energy loss @xcite . using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and taking into account the intricate landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) @xcite interference effect",
    ", one can calculate the radiative energy loss .",
    "it has a unique dependence on the path length traversed by the parton and the local gluon density of the medium .",
    "such energy loss is manifested in the modification of the effective parton fragmentation functions @xcite which in turn leads to the suppression of the single inclusive hadron spectra . in non - central heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the path length dependence of the energy loss gives rise to the azimuthal angle dependence of the high @xmath0 single hadron spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore , experimental measurements of the suppression of single hadron spectra or the modification of the fragmentation functions and their centrality dependence can provide important information about the initial gluon density and geometry of the produced dense matter .",
    "moreover , one can go beyond single hadron spectra and study the modification of multiple hadron correlations inside jets due to multiple scattering of the parton in the medium @xcite .",
    "data from experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) have indeed confirmed the predicted features of jet quenching @xcite .",
    "one has seen not only a significant suppression of single inclusive high @xmath0 hadron spectra @xcite and strong azimuthal angle dependence @xcite , but also the suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons on the opposite side of a triggered high @xmath0 hadron in the central @xmath1 collisions @xcite .",
    "these are all consistent with the qualitative features of jet quenching due to parton energy loss @xcite . the extracted initial gluon density in the most central @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2 gev is found to be about 30 times higher than that in a cold @xmath3 nuclei @xcite .",
    "combined with the enormous collective expansion as measured by the elliptic flow of the final bulk hadrons @xcite , current experimental data points to the formation of a strongly interactive quark - gluon plasma in central @xmath1 collisions at rhic .    during the propagation and interaction inside a deconfined hot partonic medium ,",
    "a fast parton can have not only induced gluon radiation but also induced absorption of the surrounding thermal gluons .",
    "the detailed balance leads to an energy dependence of the net energy loss that is stronger than without for an intermediate energy parton @xcite . in principle",
    ", one can consider gluon absorption as a parton recombination process and it continues until the hadronization of the bulk partonic matter .",
    "eventually , during the hadronization , partons from the jet can combine with those from the medium to form the final hadrons .",
    "indeed , there already exists some evidence for such parton recombination in the measured hadron spectra in heavy - ion collisions at rhic . at intermediate @xmath4 gev/@xmath5 ,",
    "the suppression of baryons is significantly smaller than mesons , leading to a baryon to meson ratio larger than 1 @xcite .",
    "this is about a factor of 5 increase over the value in @xmath6 collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of the baryon spectra is larger than that of meson spectra .",
    "such a flavor dependence of the nuclear modification of the hadron spectra and their azimuthal anisotropy is not consistent with a picture of pure parton energy loss followed by vacuum fragmentation .",
    "the most striking empirical observation of the flavor dependence , that could reveal the underlying hadronization mechanism , is the scaling behavior between the azimuthal anisotropy of baryon and meson spectra @xcite , @xmath7 .",
    "such an observation is inspired by a schematic model of hadron production by constituent quark recombination @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath8(@xmath9 ) is the second coefficient of the fourier transformation of the azimuthal angle distribution of mesons ( baryons ) .",
    "many quark recombination models @xcite are successful in describing the observed flavor dependence of the nuclear modification of hadron spectra at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "these models in general involve thermal quarks in the medium and employ the constituent quark model for hadron wavefunctions which determine the recombination probabilities .",
    "they , however , differ in the handling of specific recombination processes . some considered only recombination of thermal quarks , with inherent correlations caused by jet quenching .",
    "others also include recombination of thermal and shower quarks from the fragmenting jet , which dominate the hadron spectra at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "they also differ in the determination of the constituent quark distributions from high @xmath0 jets and there exist ambiguities in the connection between partons from pqcd hard processes and constituent quarks that form the final hadrons .",
    "one of the models that we will follow closely in this paper is by hwa and yang @xcite . in this model ,",
    "quark recombination processes are traced back to parton fragmentation processes in vacuum .",
    "they assume that the initial produced hard partons will evolve into a shower of constituent quarks which then recombine to form the final hadrons in the hadronization process . the formulation of the recombination of the shower quarks of the partonic jets and the medium quarks in heavy - ion collisions is straightforward , given both the shower and medium quark distributions . since the hwa - yang model is a phenomenological one , the nuclear modification of the shower quark distributions and their qcd evolution can not be calculated .",
    "the model has to rely on fitting to the experimentally measured hadron spectra to obtain the corresponding nuclear modified shower quark distributions for each centrality of heavy - ion collisions and correlations between shower quarks are completely neglected .    in this paper",
    ", we make a first attempt to derive the recombination model of jet fragmentation functions from a field theoretical formulation and the constituent quark model of hadron structure . within the constituent quark model",
    ", we consider the parton fragmentation as a two stage process .",
    "the initial parton first evolves into a shower of constituent quarks that subsequently will combine with each other to form the final hadrons . since constituent quarks are non - perturbative objects in qcd just like hadrons , the conversion of hard partons into showers of constituent quarks is not calculable in pqcd .",
    "however , we can define constituent quark distributions in a jet as overlapping matrices of the parton field operator and the constituent quark states , similarly as one has defined hadron fragmentation functions . ignoring interferences in the process of quark recombination",
    ", we demonstrate that the single inclusive meson ( baryon ) fragmentation functions can be cast as a convolution of the diquark ( triquark ) distribution functions and the recombination probabilities , which are determined by the hadrons wavefunctions .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the hwa - yang recombination model . given a form of the hadrons wavefunctions in the constituent quark model , one can in principle extract constituent quark distribution functions from measured jet fragmentation functions .",
    "we are also able to derive the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite evolution equations for the diquark and triquark distribution functions , which in turn give rise to the dglap evolution equations for the hadron fragmentation functions within the quark recombination formalism .",
    "such a reformulation of the jet fragmentation functions does nothing to simplify the description of jet hadronization .",
    "however , extending the formalism to the case of jet fragmentation in a thermal medium and working within field theory at finite temperature , we can automatically derive contributions from recombination between shower and thermal quarks in addition to soft hadron production from recombination of thermal quarks and leading hadrons from recombination of shower quarks .",
    "the shower and thermal quark recombination involves single ( diquark ) quark distribution functions which can be obtained from diquark ( triquark ) distributions through sum rules .",
    "therefore , one can consistently describe three different processes within this formalism .",
    "one can also consistently take into account parton energy loss and detailed balance effect for jet fragmentation inside a thermal medium .",
    "for convenience in this paper , we will simply refer to the constituent quarks as quarks and the initial current quarks and gluons as partons .",
    "the quarks from jet fragmentation will be denoted as shower quarks in contrast to quarks in the thermal medium in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we review single inclusive hadron fragmentation functions in terms of overlapping matrix elements between parton field operators and hadronic states . in section iii and iv , we introduce the hadronic wavefunctions in the constituent quark model and reformulate the parton fragmentation functions in terms of quark recombination probabilities and shower quark distribution functions of the fragmenting partons , which are defined as the overlapping matrices of the parton field operators and constituent quark states .",
    "we also derive the qcd evolution equations for the shower quark distribution functions and discuss possible sum rules relating triquark , diquark and single quark distribution functions . in section",
    "v , we extend the formalism to parton fragmentation in a thermal medium within the framework of field theory at finite temperature and derive various contributions to the effective fragmentation functions from shower - thermal and thermal - thermal quark recombination . we summarize the results and discuss future work in section vi .",
    "for hadron production processes , in @xmath10 annihilation for example , that involve a large momentum scale , the inclusive cross section at leading twist can be factorized into a hard part for parton scattering at short distances and a soft part for hadronization at long distances as the parton fragmentation function .",
    "though one can systematically calculate the hard part in pqcd due to asymptotic freedom , the parton fragmentation function is nonperturbative and currently can only be measured in experiments .",
    "however , one can derive the dglap evolution equations with the momentum scale , which have been tested successfully against the experimental data @xcite . in this section ,",

    "one encounters again the problem of interference between amplitudes of different shower quark recombination .",
    "we have to make the same approximation that one can neglect the interference term and the final result is proportional to the diagonal contribution with a constant @xmath230 .",

    "in this paper , we have studied medium modification to the effective parton fragmentation functions due to quark recombination during the hadronization of the parton jet together with a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we started with a formulation of the vacuum parton fragmentation functions in the parton operator form within a constituent quark model . in this model ,",
    "constituent quarks are the effective degrees of freedom during the hadronization of both the parton jet and the quark - gluon plasma , which is essentially a thermalized gas of constituent quarks .",
    "final hadrons are composed of constituent quarks with given wavefunctions .",
    "we showed that for sharply peaked hadron wavefunctions , one can neglect the interference between amplitudes of hadron formation from recombination of constituent quarks with different momenta .",
    "consequently , we were able to cast the meson ( baryon ) fragmentation functions into a convolution of the recombination probability and constituent diquark ( triquark ) distribution functions of the fragmenting parton .",
    "the recombination probability is determined by the hadron s wavefunction in the constituent quark model .",
    "the diquark or triquark quark distribution functions of the fragmenting parton are defined as the overlapping matrices between parton field operator and the final constituent quark states , similarly as the dihadron or trihadron fragmentation functions defined as the overlapping matrices between parton operator and final hadron states .",
    "we derived the qcd dglap evolution equations for the diquark and triquark distributions functions which are a little different from that of dihadron and trihadron fragmentation functions because of the kinematic constraints imposed by the hadrons wavefunctions in the constituent quark model .",
    "we further discussed possible connections between triquark , diquark and single quark distribution functions through sum rules .",
    "working within the framework of field theory at finite temperature , we extended the formulation of parton fragmentation functions in terms of quark recombination to the case of jet fragmentation in medium , assuming that the medium is hadronizing together with the parton jets . replacing the vacuum expectation in the overlapping matrices by the thermal average",
    ", we were able to derive the medium modification to the fragmentation functions via quark recombination .",
    "the medium modification comes not only as the medium modification of the diquark or triquark distribution functions in the recombination of constituent quarks from the fragmenting parton , called shower quark recombination , but also as additional contributions from recombination between shower and thermal constituent quarks .",
    "we also obtained contributions from recombination of thermal quarks within the same formalism .",
    "however , such contributions of thermal quark recombination are disconnected with parton jet fragmentation and therefore are just a thermal background to jet fragmentation processes in the medium .",
    "the formulation and derivation of jet fragmentation functions in terms of quark recombination in the vacuum do not simplify the theoretical description of the jet fragmentation processes .",
    "it is only a model of the non - perturbative process of hadronization .",
    "however , once extended to jet fragmentation in medium , it provides a natural framework for the description of jet hadronization in medium and the study of effective medium modification to the fragmentation functions . within this formalism",
    ", one can not only include contributions to jet fragmentation from the recombination of constituent quarks from the parton jet and the thermal medium but also the medium modification of the quark distributions of the jet parton due to induced gluon bremsstrahlung and absorption .",
