    "stimulated by progress in many - body theories and the advent of novel experimental tools like the radioactive ion - beam facilities , pairing in nuclei , and in particular proton - neutron ( @xmath4 ) pairing , has become quite fashionable recently  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to like - nucleon pairing , @xmath4 pairing may exist in two distinct varieties - isovector and isoscalar pairing .",
    "isovector @xmath4 pairing has been found to decrease fast with increasing neutron excess ( or more precisely with increasing @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the numbers of neutrons and protons , respectively ) within an isotope chain  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is obvious that @xmath4 pairing is relatively more important in @xmath1 nuclei .",
    "while even - even @xmath1 nuclei have ground state isospin @xmath7 and isospin symmetry forces isovector pairing to be identical in all three @xmath8 pairing channels ( proton - proton ( @xmath9 ) , neutron - neutron ( @xmath10 ) , and proton - neutron ) , this symmetry is broken in most odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei with mass number @xmath11 which have @xmath8 ground states .",
    "indeed , it is observed that isovector @xmath4 pairing is the dominating pairing mode in these nuclei . on the other hand , odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei with @xmath12 have ground state isospin @xmath7 ( with the only exception of @xmath13cl ) pointing to a competition between the two different @xmath4 pairing modes and its change with mass number is an obvious source of interest .",
    "the interplay of isovector and isoscalar @xmath4 pairing has been studied in various contexts :    * it has long been known that @xmath1 nuclei gain extra binding compared to the smooth trend defined by their neighbors .",
    "this extra piece , called the wigner energy , is stronger for even - even than for odd - odd nuclei .",
    "recent studies of the wigner energy tried to relate its origin to the @xmath4 pairing @xcite . * odd - odd",
    "@xmath1 nuclei are the only ones with two nearly degenerate low - lying isospin states ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "this fact and the change of the ground state isospin from @xmath7 to @xmath8 at @xmath14 has been explained by a near balance of isovector pairing and symmetry energy @xcite . *",
    "while the ground state isospin of odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei with @xmath11 ( except for @xmath15cu ) is @xmath8 , it is experimentally found that the density of @xmath7 levels at modest excitation energies is larger than the density of @xmath8 states .",
    "for example , for @xmath16rb a transition from isovector to isoscalar dominance has recently been observed with increasing rotational frequency @xcite .",
    "this transition has been traced back to a competition between isovector @xmath17 @xmath4 pairing and isoscalar aligned @xmath4 pairing ( @xmath18 ) , where the latter becomes obviously more important at larger angular momenta  @xcite .",
    "the interplay and competition of isovector and isoscalar pairing is also the theme of this paper , where we study and discuss two different aspects of this topic . at first , we perform detailed studies of the spectrum of @xmath2v . special emphasis is paid to the comparison of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 parts of the spectra and their dependence on the pair correlation strength . in particular , we investigate the temperature dependence of the various pairing modes tracing possible differences in the behavior of the isovector and isoscalar @xmath4 pairing .",
    "isovector pairing in the dominating @xmath17 channel involves coupling of states in time - reversed components of the same orbitals .",
    "very often isovector pairing is effectively given by one single matrix element describing the @xmath17 pairing of the valence nucleons in one partly filled orbital ( the @xmath19 orbital in the nuclei studied in this paper ) .",
    "in contrast , isoscalar @xmath4 pairing , even its @xmath20 component , can involve not only pairing within the same orbital , but also between spin - orbit partners .",
    "thus isoscalar @xmath4 pairing involves several scales : the coupling matrix element(s ) in the same orbital , the usually strong ( e.g. @xmath3 ) matrix element between spin - orbit partners , and finally the spin - orbit splitting which can be understood as a penalty which reduces this otherwise very favorable correlation . to shed some light on the importance of isovector versus isoscalar pairing , and in particular , on the role played by the spin - orbit splitting we study pair correlations within the even fe - isotopes @xmath21fe comparing the results of `` realistic calculations '' to those in which we have artificially reduced the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "our studies have become feasible due to recent progress made in solving the interacting shell model , which is the method of choice to investigate correlations among nucleons .",
    "all calculations are performed with the realistic kb3 interaction  @xcite in the complete @xmath0 shell .",
    "modern diagonalization codes allow now studies in model spaces whose dimensions have been considered untractable only a few years ago .",
    "we use such a state - of - the - art diagonalization code  @xcite in our calculation of @xmath2v and hence have the possibility to study the spectrum and its properties in a state - by - state approach . about a year ago ,",
    "when we started our investigations of pairing properties in the fe - isotopes , diagonalization codes seemed not to be able to handle valence model spaces of these dimensions ( for very recent progress , the reader is refered to  @xcite ) .",
    "for that reason we have adopted the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) approach @xcite for these studies . in the smmc",
    "the nucleus is described by a canonical ensemble at finite temperature . since the monte",
    "carlo techniques avoid an explicit enumeration of the many - body states , they can be used in model spaces far larger than those accessible to conventional diagonalization methods . as a disadvantage compared to these methods ,",
    "the smmc approach can not study detailed spectroscopy and ground state properties are achieved as the limit of low temperatures . to circumvent the `` sign problem '' encountered in the smmc calculations ,",
    "we adopt the `` g - extrapolation '' procedure suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "both methods - the diagonalization approach and the smmc - are well documented in the literature and thus there is no need for a repetition here .",
    "for detailed descriptions of the methods we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "first we discuss results obtained for the odd - odd @xmath1 nucleus @xmath2v by diagonalization in the complete @xmath0 shell .",
    "the calculated spectrum is compared to the experimental spectrum  @xcite in fig .",
    "we find overall good agreement , although the calculated @xmath7 spectrum is at slightly too low ( by about 400  kev ) excitation energy .",
    "given the spectrum of the nucleus , we define the internal energy at a finite temperature @xmath22 by ( @xmath23 )    @xmath24\\ ] ]    with the partition function @xmath25 \\ ; ; \\ ] ] the sums runs over all nuclear levels @xmath26 labeled by quantum numbers ( @xmath27 ) and excitation energy @xmath28 .",
    "2 displays the internal energy and the specific heat @xmath29 as function of temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the striking feature is the double - peak structure in the specific heat .",
    "while the peak around @xmath30 mev is trivially related to the finite size of our model space ( schottky effect ) , the peak at @xmath31 mev is a unique structure of odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei with @xmath11 ( except for @xmath15cu ) . as we pointed out earlier , these nuclei have ground state isospins @xmath8 and @xmath17 , and exhibit , like their even - even analogs @xmath2ti and @xmath2cr , a sparse spectrum of @xmath8 levels at low energies reflecting the strong isovector pairing .",
    "however , in odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei the lowest levels with @xmath7 and @xmath8 are almost degenerate reflecting a competition of pairing and symmetry energy .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen in fig . 1",
    ", odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei exhibit several @xmath7 levels at low excitation energy and these levels have @xmath32 .",
    "the peak in the specific heat at @xmath31  mev signals the `` transition '' from the @xmath8 ground state to the bunch of @xmath7 levels ( with larger statistical weight ) at low excitation energy .",
    "we note that the peak will be somewhat shifted towards higher temperatures if we add an attractive component @xmath33 , with the isospin operator @xmath34 , to the hamiltonian to correct for the slight mismatch between the @xmath8 and @xmath7 levels in our calculation",
    ". in passing we also remark that such a peak is not visible in the specific heat for odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei with @xmath7 ground states and angular momenta @xmath32 , where the @xmath35 level is at a modest excitation energy and due to its small statistical weight does not show up as peak in the specific heat .    to complete our discussion of the @xmath2v spectrum",
    "we have plotted the level density in fig .",
    "3 . for clarity",
    "we have binned the results in 0.5 mev bins and exhibit them for both isospin channels @xmath7 and @xmath8 separately .",
    "as is customary , we compare our shell model level densities with the backshifted fermi gas  @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 are the backshift and level density parameter , respectively .",
    "these two essential parameters of the model are determined by global fits to experimental data at low energies ( around the neutron threshold and below ) , leading to the approximate expressions  @xcite @xmath38 with the positive ( negative ) sign for even - even ( odd - odd ) nuclei and @xmath39 for odd-@xmath40 nuclei .",
    "we note that the experimentally determined value of @xmath41 is significantly larger than the fermi gas value ( @xmath42 mev@xmath43 ) indicating the presence of additional correlations in the low - energy levels other than those described by pairing .",
    "the calculated @xmath2v level density is reasonably well described in the energy regime @xmath44 mev by the backshifted fermi gas model with the parameters @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev@xmath43 .",
    "while @xmath47 agrees well with the empirical value , our @xmath41 is significantly smaller suggesting the presence of states outside of our model space in @xmath2v already at rather low excitation energies .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath41 is less than the comparison with eq .",
    "( 4 ) suggests ; in ref .  @xcite the values @xmath48  mev and @xmath41 = 4.9 mev@xmath43 are recommended , closer to the ones found here .    as we have seen already in the discussion of the spectrum , pairing plays an essential role .",
    "we will now investigate this topic in more detail by studying the pair correlation strength in @xmath2v as a function of excitation energy .",
    "we restrict our discussion to @xmath49-wave pairing only , hence @xmath50 . as a measure of the pair correlation strength we use the operator @xmath51 , defined in @xmath52-coupling by : @xmath53 with the two particle creation operator @xmath54 : @xmath55_{lsjm}^{tt_z } .\\ ] ] and @xmath56 creates a nucleon of isospin projection @xmath57 and spin projection @xmath58 in the orbital @xmath59 . in our studies involving the diagonalization approach the expectation value is evaluated state - by - state . in the smmc approach the expectation value refers to a thermal average defined as @xmath60 { \\cal o}}{z}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the canonical trace ( fixed numbers of neutrons and protons ) and",
    "@xmath62 is the many - body hamiltonian .    in the limit of large degeneracy @xmath63 represents the number of nucleon pairs with the angular momentum @xmath64 , isospin @xmath22 and its projection @xmath57 . in @xmath0 shell",
    "nuclei the degeneracies are not too large , the operators @xmath65 are not really bosons , and hence @xmath66 can deviate from the true pair number expectation value .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the isovector @xmath67 ) and isoscalar @xmath68 pair correlation strength as function of excitation energy ( averaged in 0.5 mev wide bins ) and for @xmath7 and @xmath8 states in @xmath2v separately .",
    "isospin symmetry requires @xmath69 to be identical for all three isovector channels ( @xmath70 ) in @xmath7 states , while isovector @xmath4 pairing can be different from like - particle pairing in the @xmath8 states ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 pairing strengths are still identical ) .",
    "several observations with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are noteworthy : isovector pairing dominates in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 states at low excitation energies . with the exception of the states below 1  mev , isovector pairing decreases , approximately exponentially , in @xmath7 states with energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the isoscalar pairing in @xmath7 states is about constant up to @xmath71 mev and then decreases more slowly than isovector pairing .",
    "we conclude that isovector pairing in @xmath7 states is more concentrated in the low - energy part of the spectrum , while isoscalar pairing is also present at higher energies .",
    "the difference is , as stated earlier and shown in detail below , presumably due to spin - orbit splitting , which introduces an additional energy scale into the isoscalar @xmath4 pairing mode ( @xmath72 mev ) which is only overcome at higher energies .    the lowest @xmath8 states are dominated by isovector @xmath4 pairing . in these states , like - particle",
    "pairing is roughly constant , in fact it increases slightly with energy .",
    "we conclude that the isovector pairing gap in @xmath2v is due to @xmath4 pairing . for states with @xmath73 mev ,",
    "when the `` pairing gap '' is overcome , we find no large difference between the three isovector pairing correlation strengths .",
    "while the sum of isovector pairing is still larger than the isoscalar pairing strength , the latter is stronger than each of the three individual channels . as for @xmath7 states , isoscalar pairing decreases",
    "more slowly than isovector pairing and becomes the largest correlation for @xmath74 mev ( however , at these high excitation energies our model space is quantitatively not adequate anymore and should be extended to include the two neighboring major shells ) .",
    "what is the origin of the pairing correlations ?",
    "it is wellknown that a `` realistic '' shell model interaction can be approximated by a monopole term and a two - body piece consisting of pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath75 ) terms ( bes - sorensen interaction  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the correlation can reflect both genuine pairing interaction or deformation which is related to the @xmath75 interaction . to distinguish between these different sources we define first the total correlation energy @xmath76 by subtracting the monopole contribution that includes both single particle energies and average two body matrix elements  @xcite from the expectation value of the full hamiltonian .",
    "next , we measure the importance of the two dominating pieces in the residual interaction by calculating the expectation values of the pairing , @xmath77 , and quadrupole - quadrupole , @xmath78 , hamiltonians in the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian .",
    "these hamiltonians are defined by    @xmath79    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the mass quadrupole operator defined as : @xmath82    the values of the different constants are taken from table ii of reference  @xcite . after scaling to the corresponding @xmath83",
    "the values are : @xmath84  mev , @xmath85  mev , and @xmath86  mev .",
    "the expectation values are shown in fig .",
    "5 as a function of temperature .",
    "we have additionally split them into their isovector and isoscalar components defined by taking the isovector and isoscalar pieces of the respective hamiltonians when they are written in the normal order .",
    "the results support the discussion given above . the isovector correlation energy is stronger than the isoscalar one . at the same time , while the isoscalar correlation energy decreases gradually and slowly",
    ", there is a noticeable drop in the isovector correlation energy at low temperatures which can be traced back to the pairing . in the ground state ( temperature @xmath7 )",
    "most of the correlation energy is due to pairing energy , but the expectation value of the isovector component of the pairing hamiltonian has dropped to about half of its ground state value already at temperature @xmath87 mev . by splitting @xmath88 into its various components",
    ", we verify that most of the isovector pairing energy ( about 60@xmath89 ) and its drop with temperature is caused by proton - neutron pairing .",
    "strikingly the isoscalar pairing correlation energy decreases very slowly .",
    "while the results for the isovector pairing correlation energy confirms the expectation and shows that this degree of freedom is mainly concentrated in states at low excitation energies , our calculation suggests that a well pronounced `` pairing gap '' does not exist in isoscalar pairing .",
    "this conclusion is based on the comparison of the isovector and isoscalar pair correlation energies in fig .",
    "5 ; there is no peak at low energies in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "( the apparent minimum of the @xmath90 level density around 2 mev in fig . 3 appears to be a statistical fluctuation . )    on the other hand , the isoscalar component of @xmath78 increases slightly at small temperatures , counterbalancing the slight decrease in the isoscalar piece of @xmath88 .",
    "the isovector component of @xmath78 is roughly constant in the temperature regime @xmath91 mev , which is dominated by the states with large isovector pairing contributions .",
    "we also notice that the isoscalar quadrupole - quadrupole correlations decrease more slowly than the isovector ones .    in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "we compare the values of the different correlations obtained by adding the isoscalar and isovector parts . clearly pairing plus quadrupole accounts for most of the total correlation energy as measured by @xmath76 .",
    "the contributions of the other components of the nuclear force ( see  @xcite for a complete characterization ) are practically independent of the temperature .",
    "we note that at @xmath92  mev , where the peak in the specific heat in figure  [ fig2 ] appears , the quadrupole correlations became dominant over pairing correlations as the low lying @xmath7 states , that dominate the thermal average at this temperatures , have bigger quadrupole energies than pairing energies .",
    "finally , we like to report on smmc calculations of the even fe - nuclei @xmath93fe . we have chosen this set of isotopes as it includes an @xmath1 nucleus ( @xmath94fe ) , a closed - shell nucleus ( @xmath95fe ) , and nuclei with valence protons and neutrons in different subshells ( @xmath96fe ) .",
    "our calculation parallels the smmc study in ref .",
    "@xcite where the reader might find details about the approach .",
    "parts of the results concerning pairing have already been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , although in different context .    to distinguish between genuine pair correlations and those reflecting the different number of neutrons",
    ", we introduce the excess of pair correlations @xmath97 defined by subtracting the mean - field values from the pair correlation strength defined in eq .",
    "( [ e : pair ] ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite we define the mean - field value by the uncorrelated fermi gas value using the factorization @xmath98 where @xmath99 are the occupation numbers .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the excess of isovector and isoscalar pair correlations .",
    "furthermore we have indicated which orbital coupling mainly contribute to these excesses .",
    "isovector @xmath4 correlations are strongest in the @xmath1 nucleus @xmath94fe and decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "this result confirms the general trend already outlined in @xcite which noticed that with increasing @xmath5 nuclear ground states show the tendency to split into separate proton and neutron condensates .",
    "the decreasing @xmath4 correlations also allow an increase in @xmath9 correlation with growing @xmath5 , as can be also seen in fig .",
    "7 . the excess of @xmath10 correlations , however , does not follow the simple so(5 ) picture as shell effects , which are not present in that model , play an essential role .",
    "one clearly observes that @xmath97 decreases strongly towards the magic neutron number @xmath100 reflecting the closure of the @xmath19 shell in @xmath95fe . with two neutrons outside of @xmath19",
    "neutron correlations increase again @xmath101fe ) , but are somewhat reduced again in @xmath15fe due to the partly closure of the @xmath102 subshell . for this nucleus",
    "most of the @xmath10 correlations are due to pairing in the @xmath103 and @xmath104 orbitals .",
    "a closer inspection of the @xmath9 correlations indicates that the @xmath103 orbitals contribute more than the @xmath102 orbitals , although the latter are energetically favored .",
    "this is already a signal for the presence of the isoscalar @xmath4 pairing which introduces @xmath105 correlations which are roughly the same for all investigated fe - isotopes .",
    "as long as the @xmath19 neutron shell is not filled , we also find isoscalar @xmath4 correlations among the @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "for the heavier isotopes these correlations are actually smaller than the mean - field values indicating that other correlations become more important .",
    "as suggested above , isoscalar @xmath4 correlations are expected to be sensitive to the amount of spin - orbit splitting . to quantify this statement",
    "we have repeated our smmc studies of @xmath106fe and @xmath107fe by artificially reducing the spin - orbit splitting in the single - particle energies by a factor of 2 ; thus we use @xmath108 as expected , the reduction of the spin - orbit splitting generally increases the isoscalar correlations at the expense of the isovector correlations .",
    "in particular , the isoscalar correlations due to the coupling of the spin - orbit partners @xmath105 are strongly increased ( by about a factor of 2.5 in these nuclei ) . however , a deviation from this general trend is also noteworthy .",
    "the increase of isoscalar correlations leads also to an increase of @xmath10 correlations in @xmath107fe due to increase of correlations in the @xmath103 orbital .",
    "obviously coupling between @xmath109 is very strong .",
    "will it dominate if the spin - orbit splitting were removed ?",
    "unfortunately such a calculation can not be performed with the smmc method due to the breakdown of the g - extrapolation  @xcite .",
    "for that reason we have gone back to @xmath2v and have performed one shell model diagonalization study with the kb3 interaction and one in which the monopole terms have been removed from the interaction . in both cases",
    "we then calculated the expectation value of the isovector and isoscalar pairing hamiltonians in the lowest @xmath7 state , which is the ground state in this academic case .",
    "for the eigenstate of the realistic hamiltonian we find @xmath110  mev and @xmath111  mev , while the magnitude is inverted if the monopole terms are taken out : @xmath112 mev and @xmath113 mev .",
    "it is thus obvious that isovector correlations in odd - odd @xmath1 nuclei win over isoscalar correlations due to the presence of the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "modern diagonalization codes make it possible to study nuclear spectra state - by - state even for nuclei rather far away from closed shells , where correlations play a decisive role . here , we use the @xmath114 odd - odd nucleus @xmath2v as a case study for the investigation of pairing and other correlations .",
    "we are able to describe not only the ground state , but the development of various correlations with the excitation energy and , respectively , temperature .",
    "our main emphasis is on the competition between the two basic modes ( like - particle ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and proton - neutron ( @xmath4 ) ) of the isovector pairing on one hand , and the isoscalar pairing on the other hand .",
    "these features are particularly important in @xmath2v , where the ground state spin and isospin @xmath115 demonstrates the importance of the @xmath116 isovector pairing .",
    "we show that this mode of pairing peaks sharply at low energies . at energies or temperatures above the isovector pairing gap ( @xmath117 mev or @xmath118 mev ) the three isovector pairing strengths become essentially equal to each other , and gradually decrease . at the same time",
    ", the isoscalar pairing energy , which is smaller than the isovector one inside the gap , becomes at higher energies comparable with the @xmath119 isovector pairing , or even bigger .",
    "we have shown ( fig .",
    "2 ) that the large statistical weight of the low - lying excited isospin @xmath90 states causes a characteristic maximum in the specific heat @xmath120 .",
    "this feature represents an analog of the phase transition from the @xmath8 ground state to the regime where the partition function and internal energy are dominated by the @xmath7 states .    finally , we study the contributions to the correlation energy at different temperatures in @xmath2v .",
    "we show , first of all , that as expected pairing and quadrupole correlations account for most of the total correlation energy everywhere .",
    "all other correlations contribute about 2 mev , and this amount is essentially independent of temperature .",
    "pairing dominates near the ground state , but soon ( for temperatures above 250 kev ) pairing and quadrupole correlation energies become comparable .    in an additional study based on the smmc we show how pair correlations in fe isotopes depend on @xmath121 . in particular , we were able to trace the contribution of individual subshells to the pairing strength .",
    "that calculation also confirmed that the isovector @xmath4 pairing strength decreases fast with increasing @xmath121 . on the other hand ,",
    "the isoscalar @xmath4 pairing in this chain of isotopes is almost independent on @xmath121 .    in the su(4 )",
    "limit , i.e. for degenerate single particle levels , identical coupling constant of the isoscalar and isovector pairing force and absence of other components in the residual interaction , the lowest @xmath7 and @xmath8 states are degenerate .",
    "however , these symmetries are lifted in realistic cases and , for the present nucleus @xmath2v , the ground state has @xmath8 .",
    "at first we note that the coupling constant of the isoscalar and isovector pairing force , determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , are @xmath122 = 0.37 mev , and @xmath123 = 0.57 mev , i.e. the isoscalar pairing is stronger .",
    "why does the isovector pairing nevertheless dominate the ground state ?",
    "we argued that the effect of the isoscalar pairing is weakened by the spin - orbit splitting which introduces additional energy scale into the problem .",
    "the isoscalar pairing can act efficiently only at energies where the spin - orbit splitting plays only a minor role . to prove that point",
    "we have artificially reduced the spin orbit splitting in fe isotopes , and indeed observed an increase of the isoscalar pairing . but through higher order effects the isovector pairing was affected as well .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that in the lowest @xmath7 state in @xmath2v the isoscalar correlations would prevail if the spin - orbit force were switched off .",
    "thus , this somewhat academic exercise has confirmed to us that without the strong spin - orbit force the nuclear ground states would look very differently from the ones we are familiar with ."
