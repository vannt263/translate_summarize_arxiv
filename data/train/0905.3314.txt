    "the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) describes an impurity of localized @xmath2-states with local coulomb interaction embedded into a metallic host of non - interacting @xmath3-band electrons.@xcite in its simplest version it discards the possibility of a complex orbital structure of the impurity and models the local @xmath2-states through a two - fold degenerate @xmath4-orbital .",
    "the hamiltonian for the impurity reads @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 the usual creation ( annihilation ) and number operators for @xmath2-electron with spin @xmath9 , respectively .",

    "the non - interacting conduction electrons are modeled by a single band of bloch states with crystal momentum @xmath11 characterized by the dispersion relation @xmath12 , @xmath13 these two parts mix via a hybridization amplitude @xmath14 , @xmath15 the total hamiltonian is then the sum of these three terms @xmath16    even though the thermodynamics of the model can be solved exactly within the bethe ansatz method,@xcite dynamic quantities can in general not be obtained exactly and one has to rely on approximations .",
    "the siam has been extensively studied with various methods , including the numerical renormalization group ( nrg),@xcite the ( dynamic ) density - matrix renormalization group ( ( d-)dmrg),@xcite quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods @xcite and direct perturbation theory with respect to the hybridization.@xcite especially with the development of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite where the solution of an effective siam represents the essential step towards the solution of the correlated lattice system , the interest in accurate and manageable impurity solvers has increased .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the well established enhanced non - crossing approximation ( enca)@xcite to the calculation of the static and dynamic susceptibilities of the impurity . like many other approximations formulated within the direct perturbation theory with respect to the hybridization,@xcite the enca is thermodynamically conserving in the sense of kadanoff and baym.@xcite it extends the usual non - crossing approximation ( nca ) to finite values of the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 via the incorporation of the lowest order vertex corrections , which are necessary to produce the correct schrieffer - wolff exchange coupling and the order of magnitude of the low energy kondo scale of the problem . from the nca",
    "it is well known that some pathological structure appears at the fermi level below a pathology scale@xcite @xmath17 .",
    "the enca removes the cusps in spectral functions associated with this pathology@xcite and only a slight overestimation of the height of the many - body resonance at very low temperatures remains .",
    "as it will be shown in this work , the skeleton diagrams selected within the enca suffer from an imbalance between charge and spin excitations and overestimate the influence of charge fluctuations .",
    "other than that , it has no further limitations .    despite the known limitations of the nca it has been widely applied to more complex situations due to the forthright possibility of extensions . for the siam out of equilibrium it is one of the few methods to incorporate nonequilibrium dynamics as well as many - body effects.@xcite complex orbital multiplets can be included in a straight - forward manner and connections to experimental data can be made.@xcite however , incorporating finite values of @xmath0 may change the many - body features near the fermi level considerably.@xcite therfore , a well tested extension of the enca in order to calculate susceptibilities at finite @xmath0 with the same accuracy as the spectra is desired .",
    "in particular , the calculation of lattice susceptibilities within dmft @xcite needs a reliable strategy for an effective impurity , and the treatment of one- and two - particle excitations of the same footing is of paramount importance .",
    "calculations of lattice susceptibilities and phase transitions of the hubbard model with the enca as the impurity solver are presented elsewhere.@xcite    compared to the `` numerically exact '' schemes like the renormalization group methods ( rg ) , exact diagonalization ( ed ) or qmc , the direct perturbation theory has its advantages : ( i ) the approximations are free of systematic errors stemming from the discretization of the conduction band ( rg and ed ) or imaginary time ( qmc ) .",
    "the continuum of band states is kept throughout the calculation , and dynamic green functions are formulated with continuous energy variables .",
    "thus , there are no discretization - artefacts  @xcite and there is no need for artificial broadening parameters@xcite or @xmath18-averaging.@xcite ( ii ) the coupled integral equations for dynamic quantities , which have to be solved numerically , are formulated on the real frequency axis , which renders the non - trivial numerical analytic continuation of a finite set of fourier coefficients@xcite or deconvolution@xcite unnecessary .",
    "the continuous - time quantum monte carlo approach ( ctqmc)@xcite avoids a systematic trotter - error ( i ) but it is still plagued with the occurrence of a negative sign - problem.@xcite    the discretization errors ( i ) are of special importance for self - consistent calculations like the dmft . there , the solution of an impurity model is used to construct a guess for the green function of the lattice which is then used to yield a new effective `` conduction band '' for the impurity model .",
    "errors in the treatment of the continuum of band states will be propagated by the iterative solution and may lead to an incorrect distribution of spectral weight .",
    "the enca can be solved quite effectively on simple desktop computers , and is numerically not very demanding .",
    "spectral functions can be calculated within some seconds to minutes while dynamic susceptibilities may take up to some hours .",
    "additionally , it contains no free parameters and no fine - tuning is necessary .",

    "this holds also in cases with strong valence fluctuations , such as for @xmath163 or in the empty- and fully occupied orbital regimes .",

    "in addition , even though we believe that the qualitative features of the charge susceptibility in asymmetric situations are captured by the presented calculations , the influence of valence fluctuations is probably overestimated for too low temperatures .",
    "this confirms the expectation , that crossing diagrams , which are neglected in the enca , are essential for the quantitative description of situations with strong valence fluctuations , where the impurity occupation is statistically fluctuating .",
    "this also is in accord with the known pathologies in the one - particle spectral function .",
    "there , charge and magnetic fluctuations both contribute and the overestimation of the charge excitations at very low temperatures leads to the overshooting of the kondo resonance and the observes spikes in the dos .",
    "the dynamic magnetic susceptibility is dominated by kondo screening of the impurity spin .",
