    "the multiplication of matrices is a fundamental operation applicable to a diverse range of algorithms from computing determinants , inverting matrices , and solving linear systems to graph theory .",
    "indeed , bunch and hopcroft @xcite successfully proved that given an algorithm for multiplying two @xmath1 matrices in @xmath2 operations where @xmath3 , then the triangular factorization of a permutation of any @xmath1 nonsingular matrix as well as its inverse can be found in @xmath2 operations .",
    "the standard method of square matrix multiplication requires @xmath4 operations .",
    "let @xmath5 be the smallest number such that @xmath6 multiplications suffice for all @xmath7 .",
    "strassen @xcite presented a divide - and - conquer algorithm using noncommutative multiplication to compute the product of two matrices ( of order @xmath8 ) by @xmath9 multiplications and @xmath10 additions .",
    "thus , by recursive application of strassen s algorithm , the product of two matrices can be computed by at most @xmath11 operations .",
    "following strassen s work , coppersmith and winograd @xcite were able to improve the exponent to 2.38 .",
    "their approaches and those of subsequent researchers rely on the same framework : for some @xmath12 , they devise a method to multiply matrices of order @xmath12 with @xmath13 multiplications and recursively apply this technique to show that @xmath14 . only until recently",
    ", it was long supposed that @xmath5 could take on the value of 2 without much evidence .",
    "using a group - theoretic construction , cohn , kleinberg , szegedy , and umans @xcite rederived the coppersmith - winograd algorithm to describe several families of wreath product groups that yield nontrivial upper bounds on @xmath5 , the best asymptotic result being 2.41 .",
    "they also presented two conjectures in which either one would imply an exponent of 2 .",
    "unfortunately , although these improvements to strassen s algorithm are theoretically optimal , they lack pragmatic value . in practice ,",
    "only the strassen algorithm is fully implemented and utilized as such : for even integers @xmath15 , @xmath0 , and @xmath12 , let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be matrices with product @xmath18 , and set @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "then perform the following to compute @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 even if the dimension of the matrices is not even or if the matrices are not square , it is easy to pad the matrices with zeros and perform the aforementioned algorithm .",
    "typically , computations such as this one are performed using electronic components on a silicon substrate .",
    "in fact , it is a commonly held notion that _ most _ computers should follow this model . in the last decade however , a newer and more revolutionary form of computing has come about , known as dna computing .",
    "dna s key advantage is that it can make computers much smaller than before , while at the same time maintaining the capacity to store prodigious amounts of data . since adleman s @xcite pioneering paper ,",
    "dna computing has become a rapidly evolving field with its primary focus on developing dna algorithms for np - complete problems .",
    "however , unlike quantum computing in recent years , the viability of computational mathematics on a dna computer has not yet been fully demonstrated for the whole field of dna - based computing has merged to controlling and mediating information processing for nano structures and molecular movements .",
    "in fact , only recently have the primitive operations in mathematics ( i.e. addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division ) been fully implemented and optimized .",
    "thus , the general problem dealt with in this paper is to show that computational mathematics is feasible with dna .",
    "fujiwara , matsumoto , and chen @xcite proved a dna representation of binary integers using single strands and presented procedures for primitive mathematical operations through simple manipulations in dna .",
    "it is important to note that the work of fujiwara et al . @xcite and",
    "those of subsequent researchers have relied upon a fixed - base number system .",
    "the fixed - base number system is a bottleneck for many algorithms as it restricts the speed at which arithmetic operations can be performed and increases the complexity of the algorithm .",
    "parallel arithmetic operations are simply not feasible in the fixed - base number system because of the effect of a carry propagation .",
    "recently , zheng , xu , and li @xcite have presented an improved dna representation of an integer based on the residue number system ( rns ) and give algorithms of arithmetic operations in @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ring of integers with respect to modulo @xmath37 .",
    "their results exploit the massive parallelism in dna mainly because of the carry - free property of all arithmetic operations ( except division , of course ) in rns . in this paper",
    "we present a parallelization method for performing strassen s fast matrix multiplication methods on a dna computer .",
    "although dna - based methods for the multiplication of boolean @xcite and real - numbered matrices @xcite have been proven , these approaches use digraphs and are not divide - and - conquer like strassen s algorithm ( and hence are not particularly efficient when used with dna ) . divide - and - conquer algorithms particularly benefit from the parallelism of the dna computing paradigm because distinct sub - processes can be executed on different processors .",
    "the critical problem addressed in this paper is to provide a dna implementation of strassen s algorithm , while keeping in mind that in recent years it has been shown that the biomolecular operations suggested by the adleman - lipton model are not very reliable in practice .",
    "more specifically , the objectives we aim to accomplish in this research paper are the following :    * to provide in  2 a revised version of the adleman - lipton model that better handles recursive ligation and overcomes the confounding of results with the complexity of tube content . * to establish a systematic approach in  3 of representing and adding and subtracting matrices using dna in the rns system .",
    "* next , based on this representation system , we describe in  4.1 an implementation of the cannon algorithm with dna at the bottom level .",
    "* and lastly , we present in  4.2 a method to store the different sub - matrices in different strands , and in  4.3 , we prove a mathematical relation between the resultant matrix and the sub - matrices at recursion level @xmath38 .",
    "our approach uses the cannon algorithm at the bottom level ( within a tube containing a memory strand ) and the strassen algorithm at the top level ( between memory strands ) .",
    "we show that the strassen - cannon algorithm decreases in complexity as the recursion level @xmath38 increases @xcite .",
    "if the cannon algorithm is replaced by other parallel matrix multiplication algorithms at the bottom level ( such as the fox algorithm ) , our result still holds .",
    "the difficulty that arises is that in order to use the strassen algorithm at the top level , we must determine the sub - matrices after the recursive execution of the strassen formula @xmath38 times and then find the resultant matrix . on a sequential machine ,",
    "this problem is trivial ; however , on a parallel machine this situation becomes much more arduous .",
    "nguyen , lavalle , and bui @xcite present a method for electronic computers to determine all the nodes at the unspecified level @xmath38 in the execution tree of the strassen algorithm , thereby allowing for the direct calculation of the resultant matrix from the sub - matrices calculated by parallel matrix multiplication algorithms at the bottom level .",
    "thus , we show that this result can theoretically be obtained using dna , and combined with a storage map of sub - matrices to dna strands and with the usage of the cannon algorithm at the bottom level , we have a general scalable implementation of the strassen algorithm on adleman s dna computer . as of the moment",
    ", we should note that this implementation is primarily theoretical because in practice , the adleman - lipton model is not always feasible , as explained in  5 .",
    "the reason why we concentrate on the strassen algorithm is that it offers superior performance than the traditional algorithm for practical matrix sizes less than @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "however , our methods are also applicable to _ all _ fast matrix multiplication algorithms on a dna computer , as these algorithms are always in recursive form @xcite .",
    "in addition , our results can be used to implement other algorithms such as inversion and computing determinants on a dna computer since matrix multiplication is almost ubiquitous in application .",
    "the residue number system is defined by a set of pairwise , coprime moduli @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , an integer in rns is represented as a vector of residues with respect to the moduli set @xmath41 . as a consequence of the chinese remainder theorem , for any integer",
    "@xmath42 $ ] where @xmath43 , each rns representation is unique . as stated by zheng , xu , and li @xcite",
    ", the vector @xmath44 denotes the residue representation of @xmath45 .",
    "it has been previously mentioned that one of the important characteristic of rns is that all arithmetic operations except for division are carry - free .",
    "thus , for any two integers @xmath46 and @xmath47 we obtain the following from @xcite @xmath48 is any operation of addition , subtraction , or multiplication .      in this section",
    "we present a theoretical and practical basis for our algorithms . by the adleman - lipton model",
    ", we define a test tube @xmath49 as a multi - set of ( oriented ) dna sequences over the nucleotide alphabet @xmath50 .",
    "the following operations can be performed as follows :    * @xmath51 : merge the contents in tube @xmath52 and tube @xmath53 , and store the results in tube @xmath52 ; * @xmath54 : make a copy of the contents in tube @xmath52 and store the result in tube @xmath53 ; * @xmath55 : for a given tube @xmath49 , this operation returns `` true '' if tube @xmath49 contains _ at least _ one dna strand ,",
    "else it returns `` false '' ; * @xmath56 : from all the dna strands in tube @xmath52 , take out only those containing the sequences of @xmath57 over the alphabet @xmath50 and place them in tube @xmath53 ; * @xmath58 : remove all strands of length @xmath59 from tube @xmath52 into tube @xmath53 ; * @xmath60 : given a tube @xmath49 and a sequence @xmath61 , for every strand containing @xmath62 , then the cleavage operation can be performed as such : @xmath63 where the overhead bar denotes the complementary strand . *",
    "@xmath64 : produce _ all _ feasible double strands in tube @xmath49 and store the results in tube @xmath49 ( the assumption here is that ligation is executed after annealing ) ; * @xmath65 : disassociate every double strand in tube @xmath49 into two single strands and store the results in tube @xmath49 ; * @xmath66 : empty tube @xmath49 .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the complexity of each of the aforementioned operations is @xmath67 .      in practice ,",
    "the recursive properties of our implementation of the strassen - canon algorithm require a massive ligation step that is not feasible .",
    "the reason is that , in practice , the biomolecular operations suggested by the adleman - lipton model are not completely reliable .",
    "this ligation step can not produce longer molecules as required by our implementation , and certainly not more than 10 - 15 ligations in a row . not to mention that both the complexity of the tube content and the efficiency of the enzyme would obscure the results . as a result of these considerations , the operations @xmath68 and @xmath64 presented in  2.2 function with questionable success when applied to a complex test tube , especially when recursion is used .",
    "therefore , in order for matrix multiplication under the adleman - lipton model to be completely reliable in practice and the aforementioned problems circumvented , these streptavidin based operations must be improved upon .",
    "that way , the parallelization offered by dna can be utilized as an important mathematical tool with performance capabilities comparable to the electronics .",
    "one way we propose to overcome this potential setback of ligation is to use a modified ligation procedure that can handle longer molecules in place of the original , termed `` ligation by selection '' presented in @xcite .",
    "ligation by selection ( lbs ) is a method to ligate multiple adjacent dna fragments that does not require intermediate fragment isolation and is amenable to parallel processing , therefore reducing the obfuscation of the results by the complexity of tube content .",
    "essentially in lbs , fragments that are adjacent to each other are cloned into plasmid markers that have a common antibiotic marker , a linking restriction site for joining the fragments , a linking restriction site on the vector , and each vector has a unique site to be used for restriction - purification and a unique antibiotic marker .",
    "the method is applied to efficiently stitch multiple synthetic dna fragments of 500 - 800 bp together to produce segments of up to 6000 bp in @xcite . for a cogent and complete explanation of ligation by selection",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . to utilize lbs recursively",
    ", the alteration of resistance markers and restriction - purification sites of acceptor and donor vectors that occur in each lbs cycle must be accounted for in order to minimize the number of cycles required in parallel processing . as opposed to conventional ligation ,",
    "the advantages that lbs has are @xcite :    * the avoidance of the need to isolate , purify , and ligate individual fragments * the evasion of the need for specialized mcs linkers * and most importantly , the ease with which parallel processing of operations may be applied    hence , in order for the adleman - lipton model to be more relaible in the recursive operations our implementation of strassen s algorithm requires , we replace the ligation procedure of  2.2 with lbs ."
