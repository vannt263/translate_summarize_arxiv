    "quantum kinetics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting systems is a hot topic in the contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "it is now actively explored both theoretically and experimentally . on experimental side , both fermionic ( carbon nanotubes , metallic and semiconductor nanowires , quantum hall edges ) and bosonic ( cold atoms in optical traps ) systems are studied . the continuing progress in the sample fabrication technology allows the study of the quantum kinetics and relaxation in a variety of setups ; see , in particular , refs .  .    on the theoretical side , a common starting point for the description of 1d interacting systems",
    "is the tomonaga - luttinger model of fermions with linear dispersion relation interacting via point - like interaction . by virtue of bosonization@xcite",
    "the tomonaga - luttinger model can be mapped to the free bosons with linear spectrum which is in turn equivalent to free fermions via refermionization@xcite .",
    "being a linear theory , tomonaga - luttinger model does not allow for the relaxation to thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is by now well understood that the energy relaxation in clean 1d systems occurs due to terms that are irrelevant in the renormalisation group ( rg ) sense , which makes the calculation of the corresponding relaxation rates rather complicated . in the recent years",
    "various perturbative schemes were developed to address the kinetics in interacting 1d systems .",
    "generally , they can be divided into two classes -  fermonic  and  bosonic  .",
    "the fermonic approaches start from the formulation of the theory either in terms of original fermions@xcite ( assumed to be weakly interacting ) or in terms of appropriately defined fermionic quasiparticles@xcite .",
    "one can then speak about the lifetime of fermionic excitations in the system and discuss the kinetics in the framework of the fermionic kinetic equation .",
    "the approaches of the second class appeal to the bosonic description of 1d system , discuss the lifetimes of bosonic excitations and employ the bosonic kinetic equation as a tool to address kinetics .",
    "this idea has been used for the analysis of strongly - interacting fermions ( with luttinger liquid parameter @xmath5 ) forming a state which is close to wigner crystal@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out recently that fermionic and bosonic languages are dual@xcite .",
    "the two typical perturbations to the tomonaga - luttinger model are the finite curvatures of fermionic and bosonic spectra . in the model of 1d fermions interacting via finite rage interaction",
    "they are controlled@xcite by the fermionic mass @xmath6 ( correction to the linear fermionic dispersion @xmath7 ) and the radius of interaction @xmath8 ( correction to the linear bosonic spectrum @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sound velocity ) , respectively .",
    "we note that the quadratic correction to the fermionic spectrum translates into cubic interaction of bosons in the bosonized version of the theory@xcite .",
    "thus , the interaction in the fermonic picture corresponds to the dispersion in the bosonic one and vice versa .",
    "the comparison of the non - linear corrections to the fermionic and bosonic dispersion relations reveals an important parameter of the theory @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the typical energy of a single - particle excitation .",
    "this energy scale is set by temperature @xmath0 for a system near thermal equilibrium .",
    "the stability of bosons with respect to their interaction ( caused by fermionic dispersion ) is controlled by the bending of the bosonic energy - momentum relation .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath13 one expects that the bosonic form of the theory is the proper starting point for the perturbative treatment .",
    "in particular , in this `` bosonic regime '' one can speak of the lifetime of the bosonic excitations and employ the bosonic kinetic equation to describe the kinetics .",
    "conversely , small value of the parameter @xmath14 means that ( at the relevant energy scale ) we can view the system as consisting of weakly - interacting fermionic quasiparticles and the the fermionic kinetic equation can be used to analyze the kinetics .",
    "remarkably , the same parameter @xmath15 emerges from the analysis of the fermionic and bosonic descriptions of the dissipationless kinetics in a problem of propagation of a density pulse on top of zero - temperature background@xcite ; in that case the energy scale @xmath12 is determined by the pulse amplitude .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 grows with energy .",
    "thus , the picture drawn above implies ( as shown within a systematic analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that at comparatively high temperatures the kinetics and , in particular , the rate at which a perturbed system relaxes to thermal equilibrium , is governed by the bosonic kinetic equation and the lifetimes of the bosonic excitations , while low - temperature equilibration is controlled by the fermionic relaxation rates .",
    "quantum hall edge states represent a particularly important realization of interacting 1d system .",
    "the state - of - the - art engineering of quantum hall devices allows to create structures with a high degree of control on systems parameters , including non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "recent experiments examine the non - equilibrium mach - zehnder interferometry @xcite and energy relaxation in quantum hall edges @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the bose - fermi duality outlined above in a single - channel quantum hall edge state ( integer or fractional ) with a finite - range interaction , thus extending the results of ref .   to the case of a chiral luttinger liquid .",
    "we present detailed description of the relaxation processes in this system .",
    "our analysis covers both the `` bosonic '' high - temperatures regime and the `` fermionic '' low - temperature one .",
    "we show that in these two regimes the characteristic equilibration rate scales with temperature as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . such a dramatic change in the temperatures behavior should be amenable to experimental test .",
