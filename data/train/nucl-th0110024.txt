    "the recent development of secondary radioactive beams with sufficient intensities , which are produced through high energy fragmentation of nuclei , has opened a new frontier in nuclear physics , i.e. , the study of nuclei with extreme ratios of the numbers of neutrons , @xmath19 , to the number of protons , @xmath20 . such nuclei ,",
    "far from the stability line , have been investigated intensively at many nuclear facilities in the world as one of the main subjects of nuclear science today  @xcite .",
    "there are various of interesting problems such as weakly bound nuclei , low - density nuclear matter , novel nuclear structures of halo and skin , very asymmetric nuclear matter , appearance / disappearance of magic numbers in the vicinity of the neutron and proton drip line  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is noticeable that the halo structure in some light nuclei was discovered on and close to the neutron drip line  @xcite .",
    "those nuclei have spatial extensions much larger than naive expectations based on their mass numbers .",
    "a typical example is @xmath1li , which has a root mean square ( rms ) radius of about 3.1 fm . in table",
    "[ tab : exp ] we summarize the observed data of @xmath0li isotopes  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data suggests that nuclei like @xmath1li could be understood as a core surrounded by one or two more neutrons , which extend to several times the nuclear radius  the so - called _ halo _ nuclei .",
    "this picture is also supported by recent experiments with break - up of loosely bound neutron - rich projectiles on light targets  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21-unstable nuclei in the vicinity of the neutron drip line have two distinctive features .",
    "the first feature is a large asymmetry in @xmath20 and @xmath19 . for stable nuclei with @xmath22 , due to the coulomb interaction and the nuclear saturation property ,",
    "( i ) the ratio @xmath23 is 1.0 @xmath24 1.6 , ( ii ) the observed central density is @xmath25 @xmath26 except for very light nuclei , and ( iii ) the density distributions of protons and neutrons are similar and the thickness of the nuclear surface is almost unchanged for all nuclei . for @xmath21-unstable nuclei close to the neutron drip line ,",
    "the @xmath23 ratio is about 2 @xmath24 4 and the distributions of protons and neutrons are considerably decoupled ( i.e. , neutron halo and neutron skin ) .",
    "the second feature is a small separation energy of the valence neutron . for light stable nuclei , where @xmath27 , the separation energy of the last nucleon is usually several mev . on the other hand , with an increasing number of neutrons the separation energy of the last neutron , @xmath28 , varies from several mev to less than 1 mev at the neutron drip line , while the separation energy of a proton tends to increase and sometimes exceeds 10 mev near the neutron drip line .",
    "this difference between the separation energy of a neutron and that of a proton implies a difference in the fermi energies of neutrons and protons , and it provides an understanding of the mechanism of formation of neutron halos and skins as well as the instability of @xmath21-unstable nuclei .",
    "the partonic distribution functions in such nuclei are of considerable interest in view of these features  @xcite .",
    "the distributions of quarks in a nucleus differ significantly from those in the free nucleon ",
    "the so - called european muon collaboration ( emc ) effect  @xcite . since the early 80 s a large amount of data on _ flavor - singlet _ nuclear structure functions , i.e. , @xmath29 , has been collected .",
    "however , relatively less attention has been paid to the _ flavor - nonsinglet _ structure functions of a nucleus .",
    "measurements of nonsinglet nuclear structure functions in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) could shed light on many phenomena involving nonperturbative qcd in nuclei , such as su(3 ) symmetry breaking , flavor asymmetry  @xcite and so on .",
    "recently we have studied the nonsinglet structure function of the lightest mirror nuclei ( @xmath30he and @xmath30h )  @xcite and pointed out that the nonsinglet structure function in those nuclei is enhanced at small @xmath17 by nuclear shadowing .",
    "furthermore , we suggested that the gottfried integral is generally divergent because of charge symmetry breaking .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of the medium modification of pion fields on the _ flavor - nonsinglet _ structure function of the lightest mirror nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to study such nonsinglet structure functions using a pair of _ unstable _ nuclei  @xcite because such nuclei could give rise to a large asymmetry in isospin space  recall the first feature for unstable nuclei discussed above .",
    "the current rapid development of radioactive nuclear beam techniques at many nuclear facilities in the world will provide good opportunities for advancement to the study of nonsinglet structure functions in the near future  @xcite .    utilizing the second feature of neutron - rich nuclei far from the stability line ,",
    "i.e. , a wide range of the neutron separation energy , we could investigate the binding ( off - mass shell  @xcite and shell structure dependences ) and fermi motion effects on nuclear structure functions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the neutron structure function , @xmath31 , could be extracted from nuclear structure functions of neutron - rich nuclei , by virtue of the weakness of the neutron separation energy  @xcite .",
    "it is very important to determine the neutron structure function from nuclear experimental data .",
    "the proton structure function , @xmath32 , which at intermediate and large-@xmath17 measures a charge - squared weighted combination of the valence @xmath33 and @xmath34 distributions , depends mostly on the @xmath33 quark distributions owing to the larger weight of the @xmath33 quark charge .",
    "it is therefore necessary to know the neutron structure function as precisely as possible to determine the individual isospin distributions separately .",
    "the problem of extracting neutron structure functions from nuclear data is rather old  @xcite . because of the absence of a free neutron target the deuteron",
    "is traditionally used as an effective neutron target : @xmath35 ( @xmath36 being the deuteron structure function ) .",
    "while this approximation may be valid for @xmath37 , it breaks down dramatically for large @xmath17 because of the fermi motion .",
    "the adelaide group  @xcite has recently reanalyzed the deuteron structure function to determine @xmath31 , and they showed that the nuclear binding and fermi motion effects were significantly larger than those in earlier analyses .",
    "in particular , ignoring the effect of nuclear binding yields an error of up to 50% in the ratio @xmath38 extracted at @xmath39 .",
    "recently , the @xmath40 system ( @xmath30he and @xmath30h ) is also being seriously considered as an alternative way to extract the neutron structure function  @xcite . using realistic faddeev wave functions",
    ", it was shown that @xmath31 could be extracted from the ratio of those structure functions , where the nuclear effects are cancel each other so that the ratio is within 2% of unity for @xmath41 . in the present paper",
    "we discuss another way to extract the neutron structure function using the radioactive li isotopes .",
    "this is based on the novel idea that the valence neutrons in the @xmath21-unstable nuclei are so loosely bound that they may be regarded as essentially as free neutrons .    for the last decade",
    "polarized dis experiments have yielded a number of important results concerning the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "the measurements of the proton spin structure function , @xmath42 , by emc  @xcite , combined with flavor - nonsinglet matrix elements from weak decays , gave significant information on the singlet axial charge of the proton .",
    "the small size of this resulted in the so - called _ proton spin crisis _ , and it has been reanalyzed by many groups  @xcite . as an extra source of information , it is important to measure the neutron spin structure function , @xmath43 , for testing the fundamental bjorken sum rule of the free nucleon .",
    "however , as in the unpolarized case , the absence of the free neutron target means that nuclei have to be used for this purpose .",
    "in fact , to study @xmath43 the slac e142 collaboration  @xcite has measured the spin structure function of @xmath30he , while the spin muon collaboration ( smc )  @xcite has observed the @xmath13 structure function of the deuteron .",
    "( for recent experiments , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )    the nuclear binding , fermi motion and shadowing modify the parton distributions in a nuclear medium . as in the case of gottfried sum rule in nuclei  @xcite ,",
    "it is worthwhile to study how the _ flavor - nonsinglet _ combination of the spin structure functions , which appears in the bjorken sum rule , is modified in a nucleus .",
    "we can discuss it again using a pair of polarized mirror nuclei  the promising pairs may be ( @xmath30he , @xmath30h )  @xcite and ( @xmath44li , @xmath44be )  @xcite ( we will discuss several candidates in sec .",

    "we summarize our results and discuss several candidates for testing the gottfried and bjorken sum rules in mirror nuclei in the last section .",
    "we show the properties of the @xmath0li isotopes in table  [ tab : exp ] .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the two - neutron separation energy , @xmath95 , decreases dramatically as the atomic mass number , @xmath4 = @xmath96 , increases and that at the neutron drip line @xmath95 of @xmath1li reaches about 300 kev .",
    "the one - neutron separation energy , @xmath28 , also diminishes with increasing @xmath4 ( although it shows a dependence on the shell structure ) , while the one - proton separation energy , @xmath97 , increases , mainly due to the attractive @xmath98-@xmath99 interaction in nuclei .",
    "it is also notable that the rms radius , @xmath100 , of @xmath1li is about 3.1 fm , which is significantly larger than @xmath101 fm .",
    "furthermore , we list the energy levels of the first @xmath102 states of @xmath44li , @xmath44be , @xmath103li , and @xmath103be in table  [ tab : exc ]  @xcite , as these are expected to provide information on the spin - orbit force for the nucleons in the @xmath98-shell .      during the last 15 years",
    "the structure of light @xmath21-unstable nuclei has been studied intensively . in particular , @xmath1li , which is located at the neutron drip line , has attracted a lot of attention . there",
    "two valence neutrons are so weakly bound to @xmath103li that they form a halo structure . from this point of view , some simple cluster models such as the di - neutron cluster model  @xcite , where the valence neutrons are correlated strongly enough to be regarded as one particle , were first proposed , and those simple models succeeded in reproducing the qualitative features of @xmath1li . with increasing observed data on @xmath1li , it was , however , realized that these simple cluster models could not explain the measured experimental data .",
    "thus , some authors started calculating the properties of @xmath1li using a three - body model  @xcite , which was supported by the fact that @xmath1li is a borromean system ( @xmath1li = @xmath103li @xmath104 ) , where all the two - body sub - systems are unbound . at present",
    "the three - body model is one of the best ways to describe the observed properties of @xmath1li .",
    "however , speaking strictly , the three - body model is only valid for structureless particles . in this sense a standard model to describe @xmath1li has not yet been established .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to investigate the nuclear structure functions of the li isotopes and , in particular , to determine the momentum distribution of each nucleon in these nuclei .",

    "the geometrical parameters , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , are taken to be common to both the protons and neutrons , in order to reduce the number of parameters for the single - particle potential .",
    "the last assumption is also based on the fact that the @xmath132li isotopes are considered to have the normal density distribution ( see table 2 and fig . 1 of ref .",
    "( as will be shown in fig .",

    ", we can fix the configurations for the ground states in the li isotopes , based on the simple shell model .",
    "for example , one can write the shell configuration for @xmath103li as @xmath139 we also assume that the valence neutrons in @xmath1li occupy the @xmath140 orbit although higher configurations such as @xmath141 and @xmath142 are thought to be involved in forming a realistic halo structure . in our model the single - particle excitation energies of a neutron and proton",
    "are given by @xmath143 respectively , and the rms radii of @xmath132li and @xmath1li nuclei are given by @xmath144 respectively .      in order to obtain the potential parameters , we divide the li isotopes into two groups : one consists of @xmath75li and @xmath44li , and the other consists of @xmath83li , @xmath103li and @xmath1li . in the former and latter groups we start with @xmath44li and @xmath103li , respectively .",
    "the energy differences between the first @xmath102 ( @xmath145 ) and ground states ( @xmath146 ) in @xmath44li and @xmath44be are less than 500 kev , while those in @xmath103li and @xmath103be are less than 3 mev ( see table  [ tab : exc ] ) .",
    "we therefore assume that the spin - orbit force in @xmath147li is not so strong and that it does not affect much the rms radius and single - particle energy levels .",
    "first , for each of @xmath147li we roughly determine four potential parameters , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath126 , for @xmath99 and @xmath98 , so as to produce the rms radius , @xmath100 , as well as the one - neutron and one - proton separation energies , @xmath28 and @xmath97 , with a constraint that the four parameters obtained are not far from the standard values of the potential parameter set given in ref .",

    "we present the optimum parameter set in table  [ tab : param ] and show how the present model reproduces the experimental data in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "we have also checked numerically how the properties of the li isotopes depend on the choice of parameter values .",
    "it is then found that the nuclear properties depend on @xmath130 and @xmath126 somewhat strongly , but that its dependence on @xmath131 and @xmath127 are weak as we expected first .",
    "we comment here on the one - neutron separation energy of @xmath1li in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the value of @xmath28 obtained from the experimental binding energy is 0.326 @xmath151 0.042 mev , which is larger than its two - neutron separation energy , 0.301 @xmath151 0.029 mev ( see table  [ tab : exp ] ) .",
    "therefore , the probability for two - neutron removal may be larger than that for removing one - neutron .",
    "( note that @xmath152li is observed experimentally as a resonance state . )",
    "thus , in the present calculation we suppose two possibilities for the one - neutron separation energy of @xmath1li in order to see the dependence of the structure functions on @xmath28 .",
    "we take @xmath28 = 301 or 350 kev , and hereafter we call the case of @xmath28 = 301 ( 350 ) kev @xmath1li - a(b ) , respectively .",
    "as the neutron number increases the central potential for neutrons becomes shallow , while that for protons becomes deep ( although they show an odd - even mass number effect ) .",
    "this is vital to fit the small separation energy of the valence neutrons as well as the observed rms radii of li isotopes .",
    "remarkably , the strength of the spin - orbit force for both protons and neutrons grows drastically with increasing @xmath4 . in table",

    "the rms radius of the last neutron becomes large with growing @xmath4 .",
    "here we should point out some caveats for the present model ( see table  [ tab : exp ] ) : ( i ) in the observed data the two - neutron separation energy , @xmath95 , is not twice the one - neutron separation energy , while the present calculation gives @xmath153 .",
    "( ii ) in the low - lying spectra of @xmath75li and @xmath83li their degeneracies are decoupled in the experiments .",
    "( iii ) the distributions of protons and neutrons in @xmath154li are quite different at large @xmath155 in the calculation ( see also subsection  [ subsec : kinetic ] ) .",
    "those difficulties indicate the necessity of including residual two - body interactions in nuclei . the first defect could be amended by considering the effect of a pairing force between neutrons , while the last one may indicate that a @xmath98-@xmath99 pairing is required to suppress the leakage of neutrons in @xmath154li .",
    "note that neutron leakage or shrunkage of the proton distribution influences the nuclear structure functions much less than the separation energy .",
    "this fact allows us to use the present parameter sets for their single - particle potentials , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are common to both @xmath98 and @xmath99 , in spite of the caveat ( iii ) .",
    "furthermore , since we used effective potentials which reproduce the separation energies of nucleons close to the fermi surface , and it is hard to measure experimentally the separation energies of deeply bound nucleons , it may not be necessary to be too concerned about the caveats ( i ) and ( ii ) in the present calculation .",

    "the present observation contradicts an earlier reported result , where an approximation was used to calculate the distributions of @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "we should note that in both the spin - average and spin - dependent cases a shadowing ( and anti - shadowing ) correction would be necessary for the structure functions at small @xmath308 .",
    "this would require delicated calculation along the line of refs .",
    "@xcite . for further studies",
    "it will also be necessary to include two - body residual correlations in the calculation of the structure of li .",
    "here we would like to comment on the modification of the gottfried and bjorken integrals in nuclei : the former is defined by an integral of the difference between the spin - average structure functions of a pair of mirror nuclei ( divided by @xmath17 )  @xcite , while the latter is given by an integral of the difference between the spin structure functions of mirror nuclei  @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , such quantities could provide us significant information on the _ flavor - nonsinglet _ parton distributions in a nucleus .",
    "together with the _ flavor - singlet _ structure functions , such information is quite important for determining the individual isospin distributions in a nucleus separately .",
    "we list several candidates for such pairs of mirror nuclei .",
    "the most promising candidate is of course the pair @xmath30he and @xmath30h  @xcite , where both the nuclei are stable under strong interactions .",
    "however , this is also the lightest pair , so that the nuclear modification on the structure functions can not be expected to be large .",
    "the pair @xmath44li and @xmath44be should also be good because @xmath44be has a long half - life time ( 53 days ) and @xmath44li is stable .",
    "we thus believe that the li - be pair may be the best one for testing the nuclear effects on the gottfried and bjorken integrals in a medium",
    ". the next candidates would be the pairs @xmath1c@xmath1b and @xmath309n@xmath309c , where the half - lives of @xmath1c and @xmath309n are about 20 and 10 minute , respectively , while @xmath1b and @xmath309c are stable .",
    "for other candidates one can find some pairs , whose half - life times are longer than 1 minutes : @xmath310o ( 71 sec)@xmath310c ( 5730 years ) , @xmath311o ( 120 sec)@xmath311n ( stable ) , and @xmath312f ( 65 sec)@xmath312o ( stable ) . however , it is nearly impossible to measure their structure functions with fixed - target experiments .",
    "if dis with high energy electrons ( or muons ) off unstable nuclei ( like the series of li isotopes ) is realized by using a collider machine ( like muses or ( tesla)hera ) in the future  @xcite , available mirror pairs would be widely extended and then quark nuclear physics could be developed quite systematically .",
    "although we have discussed only the series of li isotopes in this paper , we can point out other interesting radioactive isotopes : for example , the series of isotopes of be , b , c , o , na and mg are of great promise  @xcite . in particular , the series of oxygen isotopes are interesting . in the series the smallest and largest mass ( neutron ) numbers are 13 ( 5 ) and 24 ( 16 ) , respectively . for neutron - rich isotopes , a neutron skin or a neutron halo",
    "is expected to be formed around the tightly bound @xmath313o core .",
    "if we could control the atomic number and the difference between the proton and neutron numbers freely in measuring the nuclear structure functions , it would stimulate a great deal of works that should lead to interesting new quark physics in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank f. bissey for providing us the light - cone momentum distributions of the deuteron .",
    "we also acknowledge numerous valuable discussions with v. guzey on the polarized structure functions and small @xmath17 physics .",
