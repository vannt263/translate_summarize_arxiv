    "observations of distinct populations of stars in the milky way galaxy ( young , metal - rich stars in the disk and older , metal - poor stars in the halo ) led ( * ? ? ?",
    "* els ) to propose that the galactic halo formed before the disk , during the rapid collapse of a gas cloud . in this picture , the stars in the halo are approximately the same age , with abundances which increase towards the center of the galaxy .",
    "the model predicts a relatively smooth form and shape for the halo .",
    "simple models , for instance , parameterize the distribution of matter in the galactic halo as a flattened spheroid , where the flattening is given by an axial ratio @xmath10 ( and @xmath11 if triaxiality is considered ) , with a power - law density profile @xmath12 .",
    "as the positions and motions of luminous objects in the galactic halo in principle provide tracers of mass within the halo potential , study of these objects is important for understanding the distribution of dark matter as well as providing clues to the formation of the galaxy .",
    "model parameters for this simple description of the halo have been obtained by empirical fits to the distributions of such astronomical objects as galactic globular clusters , k dwarfs , and a - colored stars . here",
    "the term `` a - colored stars '' includes all types of stars , including blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and blue straggler ( bs ) stars , which have colors and spectra similar to those of the bright , nearby , main sequence a stars on which the spectral classification was defined .",
    "the distribution of galactic globular clusters yields a fit to the structure parameters of @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xcite used rr lyrae stars to find @xmath15 out to distances of 25 kpc , with a steeper decline thereafter .",
    "@xcite also measured a distribution of rr lyrae stars with @xmath15 to at least 50 kpc .",
    "hubble space telescope counts of k dwarfs by @xcite yield @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "it is of course not required that @xmath18 remain constant with galactocentric radius .",
    "@xcite counted bhb stars and found evidence that @xmath18 increases from 0.5 to 1 as one moves out to @xmath19 kpc with @xmath20 . using this changing @xmath18",
    ", @xcite find @xmath21 for rr lyraes .",
    "@xcite find a flat @xmath18 , but less evidence for changing flattening with galactocentric radius . as part of an extensive kinematic analysis of several hundred nearby halo stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath22 , @xcite find that the axial ratio increases from 0.65 at @xmath23 kpc to 1.0 at @xmath24 kpc .",
    "most of these studies use a few hundred objects at most on which to base their results , and only a few , such as @xcite , have kinematic information .",
    "in contrast to the els model , recent research suggests that some or all of the halo may have been formed through accretion of smaller dwarf galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "one example of a dwarf galaxy thought to be in the process of accreting has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "as these smaller galaxies fall into the milky way , they may be tidally disrupted and break up into long streams of stars which can persist for 1 - 10 gyr @xcite .",
    "a - colored stars at faint magnitudes are usually assumed to be halo population ( pop ii ) stars , and hence bhb stars .",
    "however , it has become clear that many distant blue stellar objects have hydrogen line widths indicative of main sequence gravity a stars rather than the less massive bhb stars @xcite .",
    "why ca nt all of these high - gravity a - colored stars be normal main - sequence stars ? the well - known arguments against this are two - fold : first , except for dwarf irregular companions to the milky way such as the lmc and the sextans dwarf , there is no evidence that significant star formation has taken place in the far halo ( r @xmath25 30 kpc ) within the last billion years , which is greater than the main - sequence lifetime of an a star .",
    "second , the stars are too far from the star forming regions in the galactic plane to have reached their present positions in the far halo with any reasonable assumed velocity ( it takes 300 myr to travel 30 kpc at 100 km s@xmath26 ) .",
    "blue straggler stars in globular clusters , which have ages closer to 10 gyr , are an interesting example of high surface gravity a - colored objects which are present in an old environment .",
    "these high surface gravity bs stars are generally thought to be main sequence stars which result from mergers of , or mass transfer between , two lower mass stars @xcite .",
    "whatever their formation mechanism , they should also be present at some level in the field of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is a large , international collaboration set up to survey 10,000 square degrees of sky in five optical passbands and to obtain spectra of a million galaxies , one hundred thousand quasars , and tens of thousands of galactic stars .",
    "the data are being taken with a dedicated 2.5 meter telescope located at apache point observatory ( apo ) near cloudcroft , new mexico .",
    "the telescope has two instruments : a ccd camera with 30 2k x 2k ccds in the focal plane , and two 320-fiber double spectrographs .",
    "the imaging data are tied to a network of brighter astrometric standards ( which would be saturated in the main imaging data ) through a set of twenty - two smaller ccds in the focal plane of the imaging camera .",
    "a 0.5 m telescope at apo will be used to tie the imaging data to brighter photometric standards .    the usno 1 m telescope at flagstaff , az , has been used to define the photometric system , defining sdss standard stars in @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( smith et al . , in preparation ) . since the precise calibration for the sdss filter system is still in progress ,",
    "magnitudes in this paper are quoted in the @xmath29 system , which approximates the final sdss system .",
    "these systems differ absolutely ( with negligible color terms ) by only a few percent in @xmath30 , and no more than 10% in @xmath31 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further information on the sdss , the filter system and the imaging camera .",
    "the sdss has imaged a large fraction of the celestial equator ( @xmath32 ) as part of telescope and imaging camera commissioning .",
    "catalogs produced from nearly 400 square degrees of these data contain thousands of a - colored stars suitable for probing the halo , with absolute photometry good to @xmath33% for objects with @xmath34 . for reference , blue stars with @xmath35 ( including a stars ) , have a sdss @xmath36 magnitude approximately equal to their johnson @xmath37 magnitude .",
    "the sdss camera contains six columns of ccds , each of which records data for a 0.23 degree wide strip of the sky .",
    "the ccds are continuously read out as the camera scans a great circle across the sky at the sidereal rate , so the length of an imaged strip grows at 15 degrees per hour .",
    "the effective exposure time in each of the 5 filters is 54 seconds .",
    "a `` run '' generates six parallel continuous strips of sky with a gap of 0.2 degrees between columns .",
    "a second `` run , '' offset slightly from the first , is obtained to fill in the sky between the first six scan lines and fully image a 2.5 degree wide `` stripe '' on the sky .",
    "figure [ fg1 ] shows @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 for all stellar objects with @xmath40 in 13.3 square degrees of one column of sdss data .",
    "objects in different magnitude ranges are plotted in different colors . as discussed by @xcite , the position of the blue end of the galactic stellar locus shifts as a function of magnitude due to the sampling of populations of stars with different characteristic metalicities at different scale heights in the disk .",
    "the temperatures as a function of color can be estimated by comparison with @xcite .",
    "the stars in the a box in the diagram are expected to contain nearly exclusively hot stars with a strong balmer jump  bhb stars , bss , and main sequence stars with spectral type a. these bluer objects do not shift by large amounts in color with magnitude .",
    "boxes for quasar candidates , f , and g type stars are also indicated and will be discussed below .",
    "all of the magnitudes used in this paper are point spread function ( psf ) fitted magnitudes for stellar objects , generated by summing the psf - weighted flux for each object ( lupton et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "saturation sets in for a - colored objects brighter than @xmath41 .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper use the modified flux designation for faint magnitudes described in @xcite , though for the range of magnitudes relevant here , @xmath42 , the distinction is negligible .    the boundaries of the a - colored star box were chosen to provide a sample of a stars , bhbs and bss , free from contamination from other populations of objects even to magnitudes as faint as @xmath43 .",
    "the choice of a @xmath44 red limit was conservatively chosen in order to ensure that the gaussian tail of color measurement errors of the population of the very large numbers of f stars did not begin to scatter into the a star box at faint magnitudes .",
    "all magnitudes and colors in the present work have been corrected for reddening using the maps of @xcite .",
    "since all of the a - colored objects sampled here are at distances @xmath45 from the plane of the galactic disk , where most reddening - producing dust occurs , the full reddening correction of @xcite is applied to all objects .    for this analysis , two samples of a - colored stars are chosen from two stripes of data .",
    "the northern sample ( north of the galactic plane on the celestial equator ) is a filled stripe from sdss runs 752 and 756 , obtained 1999 march 21 and 22 .",
    "the stripe is 87 degrees long ( @xmath46 [ j2000 ] , and 2.52 degrees wide ( @xmath47 ) , with 219 square degrees of data .",
    "data in the region @xmath48 from run 752 was excluded , since the seeing increased sharply to @xmath49 in this region ( compared to typical seeing of @xmath50 for the rest of the scan ) . in galactic coordinates , the northern sample runs in a long arc from [ l , b ] = [ 236,37 ] up to [ 303 , 63 ] and then gradually back to [ 4 , 43 ] .",
    "the northern sample contains 3126 point sources ( extended sources are rejected ) in the runs 752 and 756 which have dereddened colors in the box in figure [ fg1 ] ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , and which have @xmath31 errors smaller than 30% ( corresponding to a limit of @xmath53 ) .    the southern sample ( south of the galactic plane on the celestial equator ) is a filled stripe from sdss runs 94 and 125 , obtained 1998 september 19 and 25 .",
    "the stripe is 60 degrees long ( @xmath54 ) and 2.5 degrees wide ( @xmath55 ) , with 151 square degrees of data .",
    "the southern sample contains 1082 stars , to @xmath56 , with the same selection criteria as the northern sample .",
    "the southern sample runs from [ l , b ] = [ 85,-57 ] through [ 125,-63 ] and then back to [ 184,-43 ] .",
    "the sdss has imaged the majority of these equatorial regions twice .",
    "sdss runs 259 , 273 and 745 ( obtained 1998 november 17 , 19 and 1999 march 20 , respectively ) , nearly completely overlap runs 94 , 125 and 756 , and are used to verify the findings in the primary runs .",
    "the list of a - colored stars from runs 745 and 756 were matched ( without the requirement that the error in @xmath31 be smaller than @xmath57 ) , based on position ( within one arcsecond , well in excess of typical one sigma astrometric errors of 100 mas ) .",
    "additionally , objects from these overlapping scans were matched without regard to color in order to estimate completeness , detection limits and reproducibility of the data .",
    "the upper curve in figure [ fg2 ] shows the fraction of objects matched as a function of @xmath36 for all stellar sources .",
    "the lower and noisier curve is that for matched objects within the a - colored box only .",
    "the maximum level of @xmath58% matched in the lower curve is primarily due to objects in one sample or the other scattering out of the box .",
    "one can estimate this fraction by noting that most of the objects in the box are on the red side , giving the box an effective width of 0.15 mag in @xmath39 .",
    "when combined with typical color errors of 2% for two measurements , one derives an expected fraction @xmath59 .",
    "the matched fraction decreases rapidly for @xmath60 . here",
    ", the requirement that the object fall within the box in @xmath38 becomes the determining factor . from figure [ fg2 ]",
    ", one sees that the a - colored star sample is uniform ( in the sense that it samples the same population of stars ) to @xmath61 and has detections to about @xmath53 ( 50% limit ) in the northern stripe .",
    "after @xmath61 the population of stars includes an increasing fraction of stars slightly redward of the box whose photometric errors have scattered them into the box .",
    "the fact that the upper curve does nt start to drop until @xmath53 indicates that the uniform sample is not affected by the detection limit , and is in that sense complete . a related procedure in the south yields a uniform sample to @xmath62 and detections to @xmath63 .",
    "horizontal branch stars , especially those in a restricted color range , are approximately standard candles . a bhb absolute magnitude of @xmath64 can be used to infer approximate heliocentric distances from magnitudes for these objects .",
    "this absolute magnitude was calculated by converting the v absolute magnitude of halo rr lyrae stars from @xcite into the @xmath36 filter , using the transformations from @xcite for the colors of rr lyrae stars .",
    "since the @xmath36 magnitudes of rr lyrae stars in pal 5 ( figure [ fg7 ] ) are similar to the bhb magnitudes in pal 5 , the assumption has been made throughout this paper that the absolute magnitudes of bhbs are the same .",
    "this approximation is dependent on the blue response of the filter used .",
    "note , for example , that @xcite , find that for objects with colors at the blue end of the a star selection box , bhbs are about 0.9 magnitudes fainter in v than the rr lyrae magnitude ( this corresponds to a difference of 0.7 magnitudes in @xmath36 , given the transformations in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure [ fg3 ] presents a wedge diagram with right ascension and @xmath36 magnitude for all 4208 a - colored stars from both north and south samples .",
    "significant structures are immediately apparent . the clump at [ l , b ] = [ 242,43 ] , or @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the northern half of the sextans dwarf irregular galaxy @xcite at @xmath67 kpc ( the southern half of sextans is at @xmath68 and is not covered in this data set ) .",
    "one also notes two dramatic arcs of structure at @xmath69 and @xmath43 in the north ( @xmath70 ) , and similar , though less pronounced , structure at @xmath71 and @xmath61 in the south ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the large structure in the north was detected by @xcite in a search for variable rr lyrae stars in the overlapping sdss runs 745 and 756 taken two days apart .",
    "it contains a remarkable population of @xmath73 rr lyraes clustered in the same way as the bluer a - colored stars in the northern sample .",
    "there are numerous smaller apparent concentrations throughout this diagram .",
    "the galactic globular cluster , pal 5 , for example , has its horizontal branch at @xmath74 , @xmath75 in the north .",
    "an enlargement of the three degrees of arc in the pal 5 area of sky is shown to the right in figure [ fg3 ] .",
    "along with the stars of pal 5 s bhb at @xmath74 , the narrow sequence of pal 5 bss ( see  [ pal5example ] ) is clearly visible from @xmath76 , also at @xmath75 .",
    "a number of straight - forward checks are performed to verify that the large structures in figure [ fg3 ] are not artifacts .    in order to assess whether these structures could be due to selection effects ,",
    "low - redshift quasar candidates are color selected from the sdss survey from a color box with boundaries @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( the small q box in figure [ fg1 ] ) and plotted in figure [ fg4 ] .",
    "figure [ fg4 ] shows no significant magnitude ( and thus implied spatial ) structure to @xmath56 , except for the increasing density of quasar candidates to fainter magnitudes . while not every object in this color box is a quasar , other hot blue sources which contaminate the low redshift quasar population , such as white dwarfs and narrow emission line compact galaxies , also have population distributions which are expected to be isotropic , showing no structural signature of the galactic disk , bulge or halo @xcite .",
    "the uniformity of the distribution in figure [ fg4 ] demonstrates the uniformity of the photometry and calibration in the sdss samples to magnitude limits of @xmath56 for objects with colors similar to a stars .",
    "fainter than @xmath79 , the errors in the @xmath31 magnitudes of f stars become large enough that some of them scatter into the quasar color box .",
    "the distribution of f stars in the northern and southern sample areas is discussed in  [ fgstars ] .",
    "the photometric calibration within an individual stripe is accurate to a few percent due to the continuous drift scanning - method of data collection and photometric observing conditions .",
    "relative photometric accuracy of objects detected in multiple scans is good to @xmath80 for blue objects to @xmath61 in the @xmath81 and @xmath82 filters . the absolute calibration , and the calibration between runs observed in different seasons , relies upon calibration patches obtained with a small photometric telescope , and is not yet final .    to verify that the absolute calibration is essentially identical in the northern and southern stripes ,",
    "the density of quasar candidates ( chosen from the larger q box in figure [ fg1 ] to increase statistics ) as a function of magnitude for the north and south is plotted in figure [ fg5 ] .",
    "the excellent agreement between the two data sets to @xmath83 is further evidence that the photometric calibration is uniform across the sky .",
    "one notes from the earlier falloff for southern quasar candidates in figure [ fg5 ] that the southern sample completeness limit is about 0.5 magnitudes brighter than that of the northern sample . as the objects are selected in the bluest sdss filters , and since the @xmath84 filter is the least sensitive filter , completeness limits and the magnitude limit for detections of objects in the present work",
    "is determined primarily by where the error in the @xmath31 band flux for objects becomes large .",
    "note that although @xmath39 colors for quasars and a stars are similar , the @xmath38 colors of quasars are bluer than a stars by about one magnitude .",
    "therefore , one expects to see a drop in a - star counts one magnitude brighter than the drop in quasar counts , as is verified by comparing the upper curve in figure [ fg2 ] to the northern points in figure [ fg5 ] .",
    "the duplicate equatorial runs 745 and 273 were used to generate a plot similar to that shown in figure [ fg3 ] .",
    "the structures noted in  [ distrib ] are also clearly visible in figure [ fg6 ] , though there are fewer stars since only half of a filled stripe is plotted .",
    "note that run 745 does nt cover sextans in ra , but does extend beyond the end of the northern structure , and thus more clearly defines its full length than in figure [ fg3 ] .",
    "while the sdss continues commissioning of its spectrographs , which will obtain thousands of spectra of type a and bhb stars in addition to its main galaxy and quasar redshift survey , a small number of representative spectra have been obtained with other telescopes to investigate the nature of the selected a - colored objects .",
    "the observations produced spectra for a sample of 6 a - colored stars selected from the sdss samples , along with spectra of 5 a - colored reference stars with known surface gravities .",
    "the lick observatory 3 m telescope was used to obtain reference stars , including cs 29516 - 0011 , a bhb identified as a field horizontal branch star by @xcite ; wd 0148 + 467 , a da white dwarf identified by @xcite ; and hd 13433 , a known a0v star classified by @xcite , all with @xmath85 .",
    "these spectra were obtained with exposures between 5 s and 60 s on the night of 1998 dec 19 at a resolution of about 6 , obtaining good s / n ratios of about 50:1 in the continua .",
    "figure [ fg7 ] shows the color - magnitude diagram of pal 5 , generated from reddening - corrected sdss data .",
    "stars of all colors within @xmath86 arcminutes of the center of the globular cluster pal 5 were selected ; note that there is significant field contamination here at [ l , b]=[1,46 ] .",
    "the vertical lines show the @xmath39 limits of the a - colored star box . a 5400 s exposure of one blue straggler and a 1800 s spectrum of a bhb star ( marked with circled squares in fig . [ fg7 ] )",
    "were taken at 3  resolution with the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the arc 3.5 meter telescope at apache point observatory on the night of 1999 may 11 .",
    "proper motion studies confirm that both objects are members of the pal 5 globular cluster ( k. cudworth , private communication ) .",
    "the resolution of these spectra is approximately 3  at a s / n @xmath87 for the brighter object and 15 for the fainter .",
    "wavelength calibrations were obtained and standard flats and reductions were applied to all spectral data .",
    "six additional 30 min spectra of @xmath88 a - colored stars selected from the sdss were observed on the nights of 1999 may 8 , 10 , and 11 with the dis at 3  resolution and s / n of @xmath89 .",
    "the six spectra all confirmed that the a - colored star sample indeed consists entirely of blue stars with strong balmer lines , and is not contaminated by significant numbers of white dwarfs , quasars or other extragalactic objects such as compact e+a galaxies .",
    "the primary diagnostic used to distinguish bhbs from a main sequence ( or blue straggler ) stars is the widths of the balmer line profiles as indicators of stellar surface gravity ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "main sequence a stars ( @xmath90 ) have @xmath91 , while horizontal branch stars , which have much smaller mass ( @xmath92 ) and larger radii @xmath93 , have @xmath94 .",
    "this difference in surface gravities clearly shows up in the stark pressure - broadened balmer line profiles .",
    "white dwarfs , which have much higher surface gravities  typically @xmath95 , are easily distinguished from main sequence a stars . since white dwarf",
    "@xmath38 colors are significantly bluer than those of a and bhb stars , they are not present in the a - star selection box in significant numbers .",
    "none of the spectra of a - colored stars presented here is consistent with a white dwarf identification .",
    "the standard indicator which separates main sequence gravity a stars from lower surface gravity bhb stars is the width of the h@xmath96 line at @xmath97 of the continuum .",
    "one typically uses the h@xmath96 line because the a star flux is higher here than in longer wavelength balmer lines , and it is easier to fit the continuum at h@xmath96 than at shorter wavelength balmer lines .",
    "the width at @xmath97 of the continuum is a measurement robust to the presence of metal lines which can apparently widen the absorption lines near the continuum , and is insensitive to a range of instrumental resolutions , which can change the measured depth of the line .",
    "iraf was used to extract the 1d spectra , select a region of the spectrum containing the h@xmath96 and h@xmath98 lines , divide the continuum by a best fit 6@xmath99 order legendre polynomial , and then boxcar smooth and wavelength shift the spectra to match the resolution and redshift of the lick reference spectra .",
    "the difference in resolution between the sets of observations is not critical , since the broad balmer lines typically have equivalent widths of 30 .",
    "it must be noted that with very wide balmer lines it is difficult to uniformly fit the continuum in such a way that the lines themselves do not affect the fit .",
    "the results are plotted in figures [ fg8]-[fg9 ] .",
    "figure [ fg8 ] shows the pal 5 stars compared to the blue reference templates . the bhb star in pal 5 is a good match to the template bhb star .",
    "the spectrum of the pal 5 blue straggler has much larger line widths consistent with the template a0v star .",
    "the six additional representative a - colored objects were spectroscopically confirmed with spectra shown in figure [ fg9 ] .",
    "for these six brighter ( @xmath100 ) sdss northern sample targets observed from apo in figure [ fg9 ] , 4 have narrow widths , one has a broad width ( lower left panel ) , and",
    "one is apparently a metallic - lined am star ( upper left panel ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the spectroscopic targets , listing sdss i d ( or other i d such as hd number ) , @xmath101 , @xmath96 , dereddened @xmath36 magnitude , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath102 , l , b , and classification determined from the balmer line widths in the spectrum .",
    "the radial velocities of the stars were only approximately measured ( with typical error of 30 @xmath103 ) , and ranged from -120 to @xmath104 , consistent with halo objects .",
    "the resolution of the observations and uncertainties in the wavelength calibrations made it difficult to draw conclusions about clustering of this small sample of objects from radial velocities .",
    "kinematic information will of course be an important future diagnostic of sdss a - colored stars in continuing searches for coherent halo structures .",
    "as previous authors @xcite have noted , and the spectroscopy in this paper also shows , one must be careful drawing conclusions about galactic structure from color - selected a - stars in the halo of the milky way , since the blue star population is not homogeneous ; it includes at least two types of objects .",
    "one gains insight into the nature of the a - star sample by examining the appearance of the globular cluster pal 5 in the star distribution in figure [ fg3 ] at @xmath105 .",
    "pal 5 , located about 20 kpc from the sun , contributes 5 bhb stars at @xmath106 , and at least 7 bs stars at @xmath107 ( see figure [ fg7 ] ) . on an absolute scale ,",
    "the bhbs in pal 5 have @xmath108 , and the bss are thus at absolute magnitudes of @xmath109 .",
    "the large parallel arcs of a - colored stars present in figure [ fg3 ] are also separated by about 2 magnitudes , suggesting that they might represent associated bhb and blue straggler stars at a common distance .",
    "if this assumption is correct , then one can use the location of the bhb in @xmath36 and the absolute magnitude of bhb stars to determine a distance to the stars in the arcs .",
    "for example , the northern arc , with an implied bhb magnitude of @xmath110 , is then approximately 45 kpc from the sun .      in order to support the identification of the stars in the overdensities",
    ", one would like to be able to separate all of the high surface gravity stars from the low surface gravity stars .",
    "presently lacking individual spectra for such a large sample , one turns to photometric multi - color indicators of surface gravity in the sdss filters . from a sample of 1121 a - colored stars , @xcite",
    "show that they can separate ( although not perfectly ) high surface gravity stars from low surface gravity stars in @xmath111 color - color diagrams . due to the lack of a single - valued transformation between the @xmath112 and @xmath31 ( they have different behavior around the balmer jump ) , a simple conversion between @xmath38 and @xmath113 is not well defined .",
    "thus , although one can not precisely convert the @xmath111 color separation criteria to the sdss filter system , a similar idea is applied to approximately separate the populations : extreme balmer jump bhb stars are in general slightly bluer in @xmath39 and redder in @xmath38 than those with higher gravities .",
    "the other sdss filters available ( @xmath114 ) may be considered for color separation of gravities .",
    "for instance , @xcite show that in synthetic a stars derived from kurucz model spectra @xcite , different gravities separate well in the @xmath28 filter , and they derive a direction in sdss color space that results in maximum separation . since @xmath82 magnitudes accurate to 2% are lacking , for most of the faint a star sample considered here , the stars were separated in @xmath38 and @xmath39 only .",
    "( the @xmath115 color contributes little to surface gravity separation for objects with a star effective temperatures . )",
    "figure [ fg10 ] shows the colors of the @xcite models , along with the colors of the six stars for which spectra exist , and the colors of the bss and horizontal branch stars in pal 5 .",
    "the positions of the pal 5 stars plotted in figure [ fg10 ] are circled in the pal 5 color - magnitude diagram in figure [ fg7 ] .",
    "one star which appears to be on the horizontal branch of pal 5 and also in the a - star box is far enough from the center of the globular cluster that its membership is questionable , so it was not included in figure [ fg10 ] .",
    "the adopted separation between bhbs and high gravity stars ( thick line in figure [ fg10 ] ) in @xmath116 colors was based empirically on the spectra and photometry obtained here , guided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the models are valid for stars with @xmath117 .",
    "a few candidate rr lyraes , selected as in @xcite , are also indicated .      applying the color separation in figure [ fg10 ] ,",
    "the 3126 stars in the northern sample are split into 2041 candidate blue straggler stars and 1085 candidate bhb stars .",
    "the southern sample split into 674 candidate blue straggler stars and 408 candidate blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "the wedge diagrams for these separated stars are shown in figure [ fg11 ] ( bhbs only ) and figure [ fg12 ] ( bss only ) .",
    "these plots separate and enhance the contrast of the structures found in figure [ fg3 ] , supporting the identifications in  4.1 .",
    "the structures are interpreted as an elongated arc of bhb stars at @xmath118 in the north , and an arc of bs stars about 2 magnitudes fainter in the same direction in the north .",
    "additionally , an arc of bs at about @xmath61 is apparent in the south .",
    "both the northern and southern structures extend over 30 degrees or more of the sky .",
    "the sdss stripe is @xmath119 wide in declination and so these large structures may extend well beyond the narrow stripes observed here .",
    "one also detects the candidate bhb stars associated with the candidate bs stars in the southern structure .",
    "figure [ fg13 ] shows histograms of the candidate bs and bhb stars in the ra ranges of the northern and southern structures as a function of magnitude .",
    "while there are no significant structures apparent at @xmath120 in the north ( left panels ) , the plot clearly shows an overdensity of bhb stars at @xmath110 in the north at @xmath121 ( middle panels ) and also shows the overdensity in bhbs at @xmath122 in the south ( right panels ) .",
    "the bs / bhb color - color separation is far from razor sharp .",
    "figure [ fg11 ] , for example , which should show the absence of the second fainter arc from the candidate bhb star set and leave only the brighter arc in the north , does not do this completely .",
    "this is expected , since the color separation technique does not definitively separate the two populations of stars ( see figure [ fg10 ] ) .",
    "the separation is less effective at fainter magnitudes , where the errors are larger , and at redder colors , where the populations overlap in color - color diagrams .",
    "the @xmath39 color distribution of candidate bs and bhb stars in the large structures in the north and south is histogrammed in figure [ fg14 ] . in the upper panel ,",
    "candidate bss with @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the northern structure are indicated with a light line against @xmath39 color , while candidate bhbs ( @xmath125 ) in the same area are histogrammed with a heavy line .",
    "the lower panel shows the southern structure objects with @xmath126 bss and @xmath127 bhbs . in this color system ,",
    "an a0v main sequence star has @xmath128 , whereas a somewhat cooler a5v star will have @xmath129 .",
    "the distribution of bs stars in figure [ fg14 ] shows that the bs candidate stars are consistent with intermediate ( a3-a5 ) a star colors , and the population is not dominated by the hottest a0 colored objects .",
    "the bs candidate sample is also notably consistent with the pal 5 bs objects of figure [ fg7 ] , which also does nt contain any bs stars as hot as an a0 dwarf .",
    "one might naively expect the a colored stars in the sextans dwarf irregular galaxy to represent its horizontal branch .",
    "however , @xcite show that this galaxy has a young very blue main sequence ; if there is a horizontal branch , it contains very many fewer stars .",
    "the ratio of the number counts of bs : bhb candidates is 36:19 for the sextans dwarf .",
    "this ratio is similar to the ratio of the excess of bs candidates at @xmath61 to the excess of bhb candidates in the same magnitude range in the southern structure . in both cases ,",
    "we assume that the candidate bhbs are misidentified high surface gravity stars . thus for sextans , nearly all the bs and bhb candidates are simply young main sequence stars .",
    "the tight concentration of bhb magnitudes in figure [ fg13 ] and the existence of associated bs candidate stars are strong evidence that the northern and southern structures are real halo substructure .",
    "however , one must explore the possibility that these structures could be artifacts of a smoothly varying galactic structure combined with the magnitude limits of the sdss samples .",
    "one is concerned with the possibility that the northern structure might be associated with the bulge of the milky way , since it occurs at a galactic longitude of zero degrees .",
    "figure [ fg15 ] shows a simulated halo density distribution expected for a smooth spheroidal distribution of bhb stars , assuming @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "one can see from this figure that the highest density of bhbs is closer to the galactic plane in the equatorial stripe ( indicated by the line of nodes in figure [ fg15 ] ) , than to galactic longitude of zero .",
    "this is because the plane of the celestial equator passes closer to the center of the galaxy at the galactic plane than at galactic longitude of zero .",
    "the halo density distribution depends only on the distance from the galactic center for a spherically symmetric halo population .",
    "one must resort to an extremely unlikely model to reproduce an over - density such as that seen in figure [ fg3 ] within a smooth spheroid .",
    "for example , assuming an unrealistic absolute magnitude of @xmath133 for the a - colored stars , and an extremely prolate ( @xmath134 ) bulge , one can obtain an overdensity near @xmath135 , but it will be much more spread out in magnitude than the tight bhb locus seen at @xmath110 .",
    "additionally , such an exercise can in no way reproduce the observed overdensity in the south with the same smooth model .",
    "the southern structure is nearly directly opposite the galactic center .",
    "figure [ fg16 ] shows a wedge plot , similar to figure [ fg3 ] , but for f star candidates ( objects with @xmath136 ) , which are intrinsically about 3 magnitudes fainter than bhb stars .",
    "one sees here the familiar overdensity in the southern sample , but the typical magnitude , @xmath43 , is about one magnitude fainter than that of the presumed bss of figure [ fg12 ] .",
    "this indicates that one may be detecting f stars associated with the southern structure ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "note that although the density of the f star concentration appears to fall off near @xmath138 , the density of qsos in figure [ fg4 ] also drops off in this region at about @xmath139 magnitude in @xmath36 , indicating that the sample is less complete in that region .",
    "the rest of the f star distribution is consistent with a smooth galactic model .",
    "( imagine shifting the model distribution in figure [ fg15 ] three magnitudes fainter . )",
    "the halo f stars associated with the northern structure are too faint to be unambiguously detected with the sdss .",
    "a magnitude - ra wedge plot for color - selected g stars for the same sdss samples is presented in figure [ fg17 ] .",
    "it is reassuring to see no signs of the northern or the southern structures in this wedge plot ; the g stars ( @xmath140 ) associated with these structures are too faint to appear above the sdss magnitude limits .",
    "this population may prove valuable for studies of galactic structure at closer distances than those probed by the bhb / bs stars .",
    "a slight leak of f stars in to the g star box may be manifesting itself as structure in the south at @xmath83 .",
    "as horizontal branch stars have @xmath108 and bs stars have @xmath141 , one can estimate the heliocentric distances to the largest structures using the simple magnitude - distance relation , @xmath142 .",
    "assuming the sun is @xmath143 kpc from the galactic center , one can then use [ l , b ] for each object and calculate a galactocentric distance for each star .",
    "the resulting galactocentric distance estimates are plotted as ( @xmath101 , @xmath144 ) polar wedge diagrams in figure [ fg18 ] ( for the bhb subsample ) and figure [ fg19 ] ( for the bs subsample ) .",
    "the implied distance of the large clump of stars in the north is 46 kpc from the galactic center , with galactic rectangular coordinates extending from ( x , y , z ) = ( 12 , -13 , 41 ) to ( 26 , 1 , 34 ) centered at ( x , y , z ) = ( 21 , -5 , 38 ) [ units are kpc , where the sun is at ( -8,0,0 ) ] . the most significant clump in the south is inferred to be about 33 kpc from the gc extending from ( x , y , z ) = ( -18 , 9 , -25 ) to ( x , y , z ) = ( -25 , 3 , -22 ) centered at ( -22 , 6 , -24 ) . the significance of other smaller clumps seen in figures [ fg18 ] and [ fg19 ] is tantalizing , and merits kinematic followup to determine if they are moving groups or streamers . in this coordinate system",
    ", sextans is at ( -36 , -53 , 58 ) and pal 5 is at ( 7 , 0 , 16 ) .    because of the small declination coverage currently available , the full extent of these large halo structures is not known .",
    "however , an extent of 30 degrees in ra at 46 kpc , with a ` depth ' of at up to ten kpc ( from the spread in magnitudes in figure [ fg13 ] ) , suggests a structure of extent at least 20 kpc by at least 2 kpc by up to 10 kpc . a significant fraction of the assumed width from the magnitude spread could be due to the intrinsic spread in the absolute magnitudes of bhb stars , and the actual structures could in fact be extremely long and narrow `` streams '' .",
    "one can estimate the implied total mass for the large structures in the northern and southern samples from the number of bhb stars observed . from the data associated with figure [ fg13 ] ,",
    "one estimates that there are 200 bhb stars ( above background ) in the northern structure .",
    "to arrive at this estimate , one uses the counts per square degree of bs and bhb stars in the left hand panel in figure [ fg13 ] to estimate the background ; the counts above background are assumed to be associated with the structures .",
    "excess counts at @xmath110 in the northern sample and at @xmath145 in the southern sample were assumed to be bhb stars .",
    "likewise , excess counts at @xmath43 in the northern sample and at @xmath61 in the southern sample were assumed to be bss .    in pal 5 , there are five bhb stars in the sample . from comparisons of the total magnitude of pal 5 to other globular clusters",
    "as tabulated in @xcite , we estimate the mass of pal 5 to be @xmath146 .",
    "scaling up from a globular cluster mass , a lower limit on the inferred mass in the part of the northern structure detected is then @xmath147 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with estimates of the mass from extrapolations from the number of rr lyrae stars .",
    "ivezic et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detect nearly 80 rr lyrae variables at @xmath148% efficiency within the northern clump , as compared to five in pal 5 , giving a ratio of 160 to five as compared with the above ratio of 200 to five .",
    "an estimated 60 bhb stars in the southern structure implies a lower limit for the mass of @xmath149 .",
    "there is of course no way to tell what fraction of the structure is detected ; more data from the sdss survey will eventually be able to map out the full extent of such structures .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the ratio of bs : bhb stars in the large structures . in the globular cluster pal 5 , in the color range @xmath150",
    ", there are 7 bs stars and 5 bhbs for a ratio of 1.4:1 . in the northern clump , an estimate of 450 bss is made by assuming a background similar to that in the upper left hand panel of [ fg13 ] , giving a ratio of 2.2:1 when combined with the 200 bhbs seen .",
    "the bss are near the limit of detection in the north , and the sample is incomplete , so the ratio may be considerably larger . for the southern structure ,",
    "about 380 bss are estimated , compared with about 60 bhbs , for a ratio of 6:1 , with considerable uncertainty . for a - colored stars in the field",
    "not associated with the clumps , a ratio of about 2:1 is estimated by the same technique .",
    "@xcite explore the populations of blue stars located at @xmath151 kpc and find a relatively large specific ratio of blue metal poor to field horizontal branch objects ( which are similar to the bs and bhb categories characterized here , though based on somewhat different selection criteria ) .",
    "this apparent variation in the bs : bhb ratio between globular clusters , in the field and in the northern and southern structures , while still somewhat uncertain , appears to be a significant effect , indicating different populations of stars populate different regions of the halo .    the large angular extent and",
    "relatively low surface brightness of these structures leads one to believe that these may be tidally disrupted streamers in the halo .",
    "the fact that two such structures were detected in 370 square degrees of data ( @xmath152% of the sky ) leads one to ask how common these structures might be in the galactic halo .",
    "if the distribution of these objects is uniform across the sky , there may be as many as 200 of these to @xmath153 magnitude in @xmath36 .",
    "since the size of the structures parallel to the line of sight could be as large as 10 kiloparsecs , the area effectively surveyed may be up to five times larger than the survey area ( since the width of the stripe is approximately 2 kpc at @xmath154 magnitude ) . in this case the total expected number of such structures in the halo would be 40 , or fewer if the length of each streamer is much greater than 20 kpc .",
    "the existence of such structures lends strength to the argument that some or all of the halo of our galaxy has been formed through the accretion , or at least the disruption , of smaller stellar systems @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have found evidence for coherent structures in the halo using kinematic information .",
    "@xcite found a clump of 69 halo stars about 45 kpc above the north galactic pole with very similar radial velocities and proper motions and identified a moving group . @xcite",
    "simulate satellite galaxy disruption and phase - space diffusion in the halo and suggest that the halo could consist of 300500 streams with components that pass close to the sun , a number consistent with that estimated above .",
    "earlier , @xcite noted a group of 7 field horizontal branch stars with similar radial velocities all within 1 square degree on the sky and furthermore noted a positive signal in the 2-point star - star correlation function of a - colored objects on scales of 10@xmath155 .    a cross - check against 21 cm emitting high velocity clouds @xcite does not show any obvious positional matches with these large structures in the north and south , but if even small amounts of gas is associated with the structures , a scenario such as that described in @xcite could hold , where the halos of galaxies are full of small complex , quasar absorption line producing structures .",
    "if the structures are as numerous as 100 in the halo , then they could contain a few@xmath156 , a significant fraction of the luminous halo .",
    "this is corroborated by figure 13 , from which one estimates that one in four of the bhb stars in the combined samples are in one of the two large clumps ( using the color separation of stellar types for field stars , and magnitude separation of the stellar types in the clumps ) .",
    "to review : for the structure in the north , one sees bhb and bs candidate stars and for the structure in the south , which is closer , one sees these related populations of stars : bhb candidates , bs candidates , and f stars in numerical proportions which are not completely out of line with expectations from globular clusters or that of known galactic populations .",
    "the rough mass estimates for the structures are somewhat above that for a massive globular cluster , and only a factor of a few smaller than that of known dwarf companions to the milky way .",
    "thus galaxies like ursa minor or the draco dwarf spheroidal at about 70 kpc from the galactic center , which currently have central stellar densities much higher than those inferred for the extended structures in the north and the south , could provide progenitors of the low density structures seen in figure [ fg3 ] .",
    "it should be noted that the mass estimates from bhb stars is highly uncertain , and assumes similar horizontal branch structure for all populations .",
    "if bs counts were used , the mass estimates would be several times higher .",
    "the discovery of extensive structures in the outer galactic halo is extremely interesting , and the number of a - colored stars associated with structures is of the same order as that in a supposed smooth background distribution of halo tracers .",
    "this renders attempts to fit a smooth spheroid model with a single values of @xmath101 and @xmath18 problematic .",
    "the approximate separation of bhb and bs stars in  [ split ] , however , can be used to try and isolate only bhb tracers , and if one restricts that sample further to avoid the obvious clumps , one may still attempt a significant fit to a smooth spheroid .",
    "figures [ fg20 ] shows a maximum likelihood fit to flattened spheroidal models of bhb candidate stars in the north and south .",
    "fits were restricted to those bhb color candidates with implied @xmath157 , to regions which avoided the clump at @xmath158 in the south , and to regions which avoided saturated detections of stars ( which occurs in the sdss at about @xmath159 ) . constraining the fit to match",
    "the numbers of objects seen in the north and south simultaneously helps greatly in restricting parameter space .",
    "the model fit uses @xmath160 , where @xmath161 , and @xmath162 are galactic rectangular coordinates . setting @xmath163 , @xmath101 and @xmath164",
    "are allowed to vary .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimate of the halo structure parameters for @xmath165 is : @xmath166 , in agreement with @xcite and many other authors .",
    "models with @xmath132 or @xmath167 yield significantly worse fits to the sample . after the numerous cuts placed on the input candidate sample , the number of stars fit is 527 stars .",
    "the fit can be extrapolated to provide a local density for bhb stars at a distance of 8 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "this normalization yields @xmath168 , in reasonable agreement with earlier studies @xcite .",
    "more data , and cleaner spectroscopic separation of bhb from bs stars will of course help improve the confidence in these numbers to @xmath169 kpc , though if the presence of enormous structures in the outer halo at larger radii is pervasive , fitting a single set of parameters to the shape of the outer halo may not provide much insight into its overall mass distribution .",
    "* a sample of 4208 a - colored stars from the sdss is uniform to @xmath62 and extends to @xmath56 .",
    "this sample is used to probe halo structure at distances of up to @xmath170 kpc from the galactic center . *",
    "a plot of all a - colored stars in magnitude - angle space shows significant clumpiness , including a large structure in the north at ( @xmath101 , @xmath96 ) = ( 220@xmath1 , @xmath171 ) extending over 30 degrees in length and at least 2.5 degrees in width .",
    "the remarkable detection of a clump of 80 rr lyraes in this same area of sky by @xcite demonstrates the coherence and existence of this structure . in the south ,",
    "a second extended structure of over 20 degrees in length is apparent .",
    "numerous smaller structures , including the known dwarf irregular sextans ( at 75 kpc from the galactic center ) and the globular cluster pal 5 are also clearly visible . *",
    "the example of pal 5 , which has a bhb and a bs sequence two magnitudes below its bhb , suggests an explanation for the parallel magnitude - angle - space arcs seen in the larger blue star halo samples .",
    "photometric separation of a star surface gravities supports this explanation .",
    "a majority of the high surface gravity a - colored stars in the halo may be bss . *",
    "based on followup spectroscopy of eight objects , there are at least two sub - populations of a - colored stars identified : blue horizontal branch stars with low surface gravities , and blue straggler stars with high surface gravities and absolute magnitudes one to three magnitudes fainter than the horizontal branch . * the assumption of @xmath108 for the horizontal branch yields approximate distances to the large clumps in the north and south of 46 kpc and 33 kpc from the galactic center at positions ( x , y , z ) = ( 21 , -5 , 38 ) and ( -22 , 6 , -24 ) kpc , respectively .",
    "the inferred masses of the detected structures is at least @xmath147 in the north and at least @xmath172 in the south , though it is not known what fraction of the total extent of these elongated structures has so far been detected . from estimates of the mass in these structures and the fraction of sample bhb stars they contain , one concludes that structures such as these could contain a significant fraction of the mass of the luminous halo . * fitting the ` field ' bhb candidate stars , ( those which avoid the structures ) , while requiring a consistent normalization between northern and southern galactic samples , yields a maximum likelihood fit to a spheroidal halo model of @xmath173 and flattening of @xmath8 for @xmath174 kpc , consistent with previous work .",
    "since clumps of a - colored objects dominate the numbers of halo bhbs and bss at distances @xmath175 kpc , however , simple parameter fits to single spheroid models are not representative of the whole picture .",

    "<S> a sample of 4208 objects with magnitude @xmath0 and colors of main sequence a stars have been selected from 370 square degrees of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) commissioning observations . the data is from two long , narrow stripes , each with an opening angle of greater than 60@xmath1 , at galactic latitudes @xmath2 on the celestial equator . </S>",
    "<S> relative photometric calibrations good to 2% and consistent absolute photometry allows this uniform sample to be treated statistically over the large area . </S>",
    "<S> an examination of the sample s distribution shows that these stars trace considerable substructure in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> large overdensities of a - colored stars in the north at @xmath3 and in the south at @xmath4 and extending over tens of degrees are present in the halo of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has detected the northern structure from a sample of rr lyraes in the sdss .    using photometry to separate the stars by surface gravity , </S>",
    "<S> both structures are shown to contain a sequence of low surface gravity stars consistent with identification as a blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) . </S>",
    "<S> both structures also contain a population of high surface gravity stars two magnitudes fainter than the bhb stars , consistent with their identification as blue stragglers ( bss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the high surface gravity stars in the galactic halo may be blue straggler stars like these . </S>",
    "<S> a population of f stars associated with the a star excess in the southern structure is detected ( the f stars in the northern structure at 46 kpc would be too faint for the sdss to detect ) . from the numbers of detected bhb stars , lower limits to the implied mass of the structures are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , though one does not yet know the full spatial extent of the structures . the fact that two such large clumps have been detected in a survey of only 1% of the sky indicates that such structures are not uncommon in the halo .    </S>",
    "<S> simple spheroidal parameters are fit to a complete sample of the remaining unclumped bhb stars and yield ( at @xmath7 kpc ) a fit to a halo distribution with flattening ( @xmath8 ) and a density falloff exponent of @xmath9 . </S>"
