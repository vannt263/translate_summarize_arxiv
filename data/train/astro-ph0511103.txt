    "pictor a is a nearby ( @xmath0=0.035 ) double lobe radio source with a fanaroff riley ii ( frii ) morphology .",
    "vla observations ( perley et al . 1997 ) show two nearly circular radio lobes with hot spots and a faint radio jet connecting the nucleus to the west hot spot .",
    "the spectral indices are fairly uniform throughout each lobe @xmath1 .",
    "xmm - newton discovered x - ray radiation associated to the extended radio lobes ( grandi et al .",
    "2003 ) . in spite of the relatively short exposure time ( @xmath2 ks ) , and the very high background",
    ", a quite good spectrum was obtained from a circular region centered on the east lobe .",
    "however , the data interpretation was not univocal , as the x - ray spectrum could be described by both a power law ( @xmath3 ) and a thermal model ( @xmath4 kev ) .",
    "the presence of an extended emission , most likely to be ascribed to non - thermal processes , has been recently confirmed ( hardcastle & croston 2005 ) . to definitely solve the ambiguity on the nature of the radio - lobes x - ray emission ,",

    "this has allowed a spatially resolved x  ray spectral analysis .",
    "the green circle indicated in figure 1 represents the selected accumulation region for the east lobe spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the west lobe was instead extracted from the pink circle , after subtraction of the nuclear and the jet contributions ( black circle and rectangle , respectively ) .    following the previous work ( grandi et al .",
    "2003 ) we tested both a power law and a thermal model to fit the data .",
    "for both lobes , a non - thermal emission is preferred to a thermal process , as shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "this appears also evident in figure 2 where the two spectral models to the east lobe data are compared .",
    "the residuals result clearly larger for the thermal model fit .",
    "the comparison between table 1 and 2 indicates that the x - ray photon index value is @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) independently of the position of the extraction region . the x - ray spectral index",
    ", @xmath20 is thus in very good agreement with the radio slope ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , the non - thermal x - ray flux of the east lobe is in agreement with the previous value reported in grandi et al .",
