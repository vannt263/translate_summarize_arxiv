    "spicules are elongated , nearly - vertical structures visible in emission above the solar limb in chromospheric lines . first observed over 100 years ago ( @xcite @xcite ) , spicules have thus far eluded our efforts to understand their physical nature and origin .",
    "once viewed as a very attractive problem for solar physicists , interest seemed to fade away somewhat since the early 1970s .",
    "most of the knowledge gathered until then , mainly from spectroscopic observations of h@xmath2 , he d@xmath3 or ca  h and  k , is compiled in a comprehensive review by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "since then , very few works have been published with new observational properties of spicules and some authors have concentrated instead in novel modeling efforts ( the most recent by @xcite @xcite )",
    ".    however , this scenario seems to be about to change drastically .",
    "modern spectro - polarimeters capable of observing chromospheric lines off of the solar limb are providing new observational constrains that show considerable promise to expand our knowledge on spicules ( and other chromospheric structures ) .",
    "in addition to the present work , there are two other papers in press with new spectro - polarimetric observations of lines , namely the 1083  nm multiplet ( @xcite @xcite ) and d@xmath3 ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "hopefully , this surge is only the beginning of a renewed interest in spicule observations .",
    "new data is needed both to inspire and to constrain future theoretical models .",
    "we present here for the first time observations of spicules in the infrared triplet ( in particular the 849.8 and 854.2  nm lines ) , alongside the multiplet at 1083  nm .",
    "the dataset analyzed here was recorded using the new spinor ( spectro - polarimeter for infrared and optical regions ) instrument , at the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) in the sacramento peak observatory .",
    "we believe that multi - line observations from different elements ( ideally with very different atomic weights ) have important advantages to determine some magnetic , thermal and dynamic parameters of spicules .",
    "for example , we present evidence of the existence of a magnetic field in spicules without having to resort on complex hanle effect modeling . in this sense",
    ", our work can be considered the first model - independent verification of the magnetic nature of spicules ( although such fields have been obtained from hanle effect measurements by @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "since the thermal broadening depends strongly on the atomic weight , multi - line observations are also helpful to set boundaries to this type of broadening .",
    "the observations that we report on were obtained on 19 june 2004 with the following spinor configuration . we used a spectrograph grating with 308 lines / mm .",
    "the asp cameras ( 256 by 256 pixels ) were set to record the lines at 849.8 and 854.2  nm . the new spinor pluto camera ( 488 by 652 pixels )",
    "was set to the multiplet at 1083  nm .",
    "the spectrograph slit had a width of 80  @xmath4 m , which corresponds to an angular size of 0.6  on the dst focal plane .",
    "short scans of 10 steps were observed at various positions on the solar limb .",
    "the scanning step was chosen to be 0.22  , which is significantly smaller than the typical angular resolution ( @xmath51  ) .",
    "this was done so that it would be possible to bin multiple images in the scanning direction , thus increasing the signal to noise ratio without saturating any of the detectors .",
    "this approach is useful for multi - line observations , particularly when significant variations exist among the quantum efficiencies of the cameras or the photon flux they receive . in this case",
    ", the asp cameras are observing a spectral region where they have a quantum efficiency of @xmath530% , whereas the pluto camera has only @xmath53% efficiency near 1  @xmath4 m .",
    "the polarization modulator used in this run was not the new spinor achromatic bycristaline modulator , which we had not yet received from the vendor at the time of these observations .",
    "we were able to use the asp modulator which , although not optimal , still provides some modulation at these wavelengths .",
    "the linear polarization efficiency obtained with our setup was @xmath026% at the wavelength of the ca lines and @xmath015% at the wavelength of the he multiplet . for circular polarization we obtained 36% and 17% , respectively .",
    "the main limitation of our observations is probably the low signal level in the 1083  nm region , due to the combination of low detector and polarimeter efficiency discussed above . nevertheless , there is still sufficient signal especially in the bright emission cores of the lines to allow for a detailed study of some important spicule properties .",
    "an occulting disk at the telescope prime focus was inserted to block the bright photospheric emission .",
    "this is helpful to reduce the amount of stray light from the solar disk which would otherwise contaminate the relatively faint spicule emission .",
    "the downside of this technique is that it complicates the data reduction and calibration by removing some references , such as quiet sun intensity or telluric lines ( useful for absolute wavelength determination ) .",
    "the polarization calibration also becomes more difficult because we no longer have continuum radiation to use as a source of unpolarized light .",
    "the telescope was calibrated as explained in @xcite ( @xcite ) , using an array of achromatic polarizers on top of the entrance window .",
    "calibration data were obtained simultaneously for the entire wavelength spectrum by means of a cross - dispersor in the beam before the detector .",
    "the datasets thus obtained were fitted with a wavelength - dependent model of the dst , allowing us to determine the optical parameters that characterize the telescope polarimetric response .",
    "another set of achromatic polarization optics at the dst exit port was used to determine the mueller matrix of the instrument .    even after the exhaustive calibration outlined above",
    ", some residual cross - talk still remains from stokes  @xmath6 into @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in practice , this residual is usually determined from the continuum polarization ( preferably at disk center , especially when observing at blue wavelengths where scattering polarization may be important ) .",
    "this was not possible in our observations because we only had spicule line emission ( the photospheric continuum was blocked by the occulting disk ) .",
    "fortunately , we also had disk observations of active regions from the same day .",
    "the spicule data reported here were taken only minutes away from an earlier sunspot observation .",
    "we used the residual cross - talk measured in the disk data to correct the spicule dataset .",
    "fig  [ fig : profs ] shows the ( polarized ) spectra of a spicule at the three spectral regions , observed on the east limb of the sun at -70latitude .",
    "notice the absence of signal in the stokes  @xmath9 images ( bottom row ) , which indicates that no residual cross - talk remains above the noise level .",
    "the real stokes  @xmath9 signal one would expect to have is too weak to show in these images ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "our observations show a bright emission core concentrated in the lower part of the image . above this bright emission",
    "there is a diffuse faint tail that extends upwards and exhibits a strong redshift that increases with height .",
    "the brightest emission is seen in the core of 854.2 .",
    "interestingly , while 1083 has the weakest emission near the limb , the bright core extends higher than either one of the ca lines ( up to @xmath05  in he , as opposed to @xmath02  in ca ) .",
    "the emission in 849.8 is weaker than in 854.2 and fades away very rapidly with height .",
    "the faint redshifted tail is not detectable in this line with our noise level .",
    "most of the discussion in this paper refers to the bright area near the limb ( the lower @xmath02  in 849.8 and 854.2 , and @xmath05  in 1083 ) , as this is the region where we have stronger signals .",
    "let us start considering the doppler widths of the lines .",
    "fig  [ fig : fits34 ] shows the result of fitting gaussian curves to two of the spectral lines observed .",
    "the ca atom is 10 times heavier than he .",
    "if the lines are broadened by microscopic thermal velocities , one would expect the he line to be over 3 times broader than those of ca .",
    "however , this is not the case as all three lines have very similar widths .",
    "this indicates that the thermal broadening accounts only for a small part of the total line width .",
    "this conclusion is still valid even if the lines have some amount of optical thickness ( which we shall neglect in this work ) , since this has a relatively little impact on the doppler width ( @xcite @xcite ) , insufficient to explain the factor 3 discrepancy .",
    "if we assume that the non - thermal broadening mechanism ( rotation , expansion , etc ) has the same effect on the three lines at a given spatial position , it is possible to establish an upper limit to the electron temperature of the spicule . let us separate the total width as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the thermal and non - thermal broadening , respectively .",
    "as we increase the temperature , @xmath11 increases more rapidly for the he lines than for the ca ones : @xmath13 which implies that the @xmath12 also decreases more rapidly for he . if we assume a typical uncertainty of 1.5  km  s@xmath1 in @xmath14 ( taken from the difference between the fits to the two ca lines ) , we can conclude that @xmath15  kk . for higher temperatures",
    ", @xmath16 would be considerably smaller in the he lines than in those of ca , which contradicts our initial assumption that @xmath17 .",
    "a summary of these calculations is shown in table  [ table ] .",
    "cccc @xmath14 ( km  s@xmath1 ) & 16.6 & 18.0 & 16.6 + @xmath12 ( km  s@xmath1 ) , @xmath18  kk & 15.3 & 17.9 & 16.5 + @xmath12 ( km  s@xmath1 ) , @xmath19  kk & 14.9 & 17.9 & 16.5 + @xmath12 ( km  s@xmath1 ) , @xmath20  kk & 14.6 & 17.8 & 16.4 + @xmath21 ( km  s@xmath1  mm@xmath1 ) & 2.8 & 6.4 & n.a .",
    "+ @xmath22 ratio & 0.07 & -1.29 & -0.88 +    unfortunately , it is not possible to use a similar argument to obtain a lower limit .",
    "the reason is that , once @xmath11 becomes small enough , the total broadening is dominated by the non - thermal component . in this regime ,",
    "all three lines end up having the same width and are compatible with the observations regardless of the temperature .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the far wings of the lines .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) noticed that their he observations had very extended wings when compared to those of a gaussian .",
    "our observations confirm their results for the he line ( see fig  [ fig : fits34 ] , right panel ) .",
    "however , we find that the ca lines show the opposite behavior .",
    "both ca lines have wings that are actually _ narrower _ than those of a gaussian ( 849.8 is shown in fig  [ fig : fits34 ] , left ) .",
    "these results indicate that the far wings are probably dominated by the non - thermal broadening .",
    "it is not clear to us why the ca and he wings would exhibit such a different behavior .",
    "the observed profiles shown in fig  [ fig : fits34 ] ( as well as that of the 854.2  nm line , not shown in the figure ) exhibit signatures of differential doppler shifts from the wings to the core of the lines . to study this in some more detail we calculated the bisector of all three lines ( shown in fig  [ fig : bisec ] ) .",
    "for the 1083  nm line we have left out the lower part of the curve , to avoid the contamination introduced by the blend with the blue component of the multiplet .",
    "all three lines exhibit a strong redshift from approximately half of the profile to the core .",
    "this redshift is stronger in the ca lines , where the relative velocities reach 30  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the he line , on the other hand , reaches only some 17  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the lower part of the 849.8 curve is also redshifted , producing a c - shaped bisector .",
    "this is not obvious in the 854.2 line , however .",
    "the interpretation of bisectors is not as straightforward as it is in disk observations , in which the vertical axis is directly related to height in the atmosphere . here",
    ", a line profile may be viewed more as a histogram of velocities .",
    "the intensity at a given wavelength is related to the density of excited atoms with the corresponding doppler shift .",
    "these curves might be helpful as a test for future physical models of spicules , in particular for the distribution of macroscopic velocities within the emitting plasma .",
    "fig  [ fig : profs ] also shows that the faint tail visible at 854.2 and 1083  nm above the bright emission exhibit a height - dependent redshift .",
    "we have estimated the mean velocity gradient ( @xmath23 ) associated with the redshift in the range of heights between 5  and 7.5  ( approximately between 3700 and 5500  km above the limb ) .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table ] ( fifth row ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mean gradient differs by more than a factor 2 between the ca and he lines ( recall that we are looking at the same spatial location along the slit ) . only @xcite ( @xcite ) have reported a similar disparity between spicule velocities as measured in different lines ( in their case , between h@xmath2 and d@xmath3 ) .",
    "this `` interesting phenomenon '' , as @xcite ( @xcite ) referred to it , would be very difficult to explain if one assumes that both emissions come from the same region .",
    "instead , we propose that the line - of - sight integration is mixing together different structures in the observed pixel .",
    "the excitation conditions in these structures may be different , giving rise to stronger emission in either ca or he and resulting in different apparent velocities for each line .",
    "let us now turn to the question of the possible presence of magnetic fields in spicules .",
    "it is not straightforward to measure such fields ( @xmath510 - 30  g , see @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) because the zeeman splitting is too small to be detected in the broad intensity profiles of these lines , and the stokes  @xmath9 signal is below the detection threshold ( or very close to it ) . even if such zeeman signals could be detected , the lines would be formed in the so - called weak - field regime , in which it is not possible to separate the intrinsic field strength from its filling factor in the observed pixel .",
    "the only possible diagnostics left for reliable magnetic field determinations is the hanle effect .",
    "still , the interpretation of hanle observations is not trivial .",
    "one needs a precise knowledge of the zero - field polarization produced by the scattering of anisotropic radiation in the higher atmosphere .",
    "the hanle effect then leads ( typically ) to some depolarization of the zero - field signal , as well as a rotation of the linear polarization plane . in some sense ,",
    "one essentially compares the theoretical zero - field polarization with the observations and ascribes the difference to the effect of a depolarizing magnetic field .",
    "it is therefore crucial to use a realistic model of the atmosphere and the illumination , especially in cases like the 1083  nm lines which are sensitive to coronal radiation .    to our best knowledge , the first claim that spicules are magnetized is the recent work by @xcite ( @xcite ) ( but",
    "see also @xcite @xcite ) , who carried out a detailed hanle modeling of the 1083  nm multiplet .",
    "having multiple spectral lines in our observations allows us to confirm the presence of a magnetic field in spicules using a straightforward , model - independent reasoning . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", one would observe some degree of scattering polarization .",
    "the plane of polarization of this signal is given by the geometry of the scattering process and would be the same for all three lines observed here .",
    "if , on the other hand , the scattering atoms are embedded in a magnetic field , then the hanle effect would rotate the plane of polarization by an amount that depends on some parameters of the transition . in this case , the orientation of the linear polarization would be different in different lines .",
    "it is clear from fig  [ fig : profs ] that the ratio of the stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 signals is different for the ca and he lines , implying a different orientation of the polarization plane ( and therefore the presence of a magnetic field ) .",
    "the last row of table  [ table ] lists the values of @xmath8/@xmath7 averaged over the line core .",
    "the observations that we present in this work provide some new insights into the physical origin of spicules . by observing lines of both ca and he we are able to set constrains on the non - thermal broadening of the lines and the temperature of the emitting plasma .",
    "the change in the orientation of the polarization plane in the ca and he lines is a convincing model - independent evidence for magnetic fields in prominences .",
    "a quantitative determination of the field strength and orientation would require detailed modeling of the line formation , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the different behavior of the emission wings in he and ca ( broader and narrower than a gaussian , respectively ) is certainly intriguing .",
    "it seems appealing to consider this as a clue for the nature of the non - thermal broadening mechanism .    in spite of recent efforts",
    ", spicules still remain poorly understood and we feel that more data are urgently needed .",
    "we plan to expand the results presented here in a forthcoming paper with new observations and more detailed analyses .",
    "in particular we intend to use an infrared camera and the new spinor modulator to obtain better signal - to - noise ratios in the infrared ( which , as stated above is one of our main limitations here ) .",
    "detailed non - lte modeling would be desirable and it seems to be well understood now , at least for the ca lines both in the zeeman ( @xcite @xcite ) and hanle ( @xcite @xcite ) regimes .",
    "the authors are grateful to the sac peak observatory staff for their help with the observations , in particular d. gilliam , m. bradford and j. elrod .",
    "thanks are also due to r. manso sainz for suggesting a plausible explanation for the difference between ca and he velocity gradients , and also for comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript ."
