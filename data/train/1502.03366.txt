    "numerical simulations provide access to properties of individual bubbles ( volume , face - number and edge - number distributions , and their spatial correlations ) with arbitrary spatial and temporal resolution . complicating such simulations are the multiple mechanisms , length and time scales affecting coarsening .",
    "slow volume changes in bubbles cause the gradual increase of plateau border cross section .",
    "both bubble and plateau - border growth can induce topological transformations in bubble and plateau - border adjacency , such as neighbors swapping ( _ t1 _ ) , bubble disappearance ( _ t2 _ ) , or plateau - border fusion , which can cause further rapid cascades of rearrangement .",
    "these rearrangements , in turn , change the slower dynamics of gas exchange ( between neighboring bubbles , and between bubbles and the liquid phase ) and flow in plateau borders .",
    "length scales include the thickness of the thin walls ( which can range from hundreds of nanometers to many microns ) , the size of the plateau borders ( which can range from hundreds of microns to millimeters ) , the lengths of plateau borders and the radii of bubbles ( which can range from sub - millimeter to centimeters ) depending on the foam , wetness and degree of coarsening .",
    "the close feedback among all these mechanisms and scales makes simulation of wet foam dynamics challenging  @xcite .",
    "the cellular potts model ( _ cpm _ ) can simulate the structure of foams in mechanical equilibrium , with a resolution ( number of pixels per bubble ) which matches or exceeds that of experimental images in two or three dimensions .",

    "the cpm correctly reproduces bubble rearrangements and disappearance .",

    "such cpm simulations agree in almost all respects with experimental observations of dry liquid foams @xcite .",
    "however , in the cpm , mass flow between bubbles and surface - tension - driven relaxation of wall shape occur over similar time scales , while the former is much slower than the latter in almost all liquid foams . extending the cpm method by interleaving steps in which mass is free to diffuse between bubbles with steps in which we constrain the bubble volumes to their current values but",

    "all three reach self - similar growth regimes with enough bubbles to yield statistically significant distribution functions .",
    "like experimental images , cpm 3d foam simulations represent space as a cubic grid of voxels , and each bubble as a connected set of voxels with particular properties .",

    "while an  ideal \" fluid particle would be negligibly small and perfectly incompressible , we assign our fluid particles a @xmath29 voxels so they are much smaller than typical bubbles , but large enough to move freely ( see figure s2 in the supplementary materials for the effect of varying the target volume of the fluid particles , which affects coarsening dynamics ) . the compression modulus @xmath30 is not critical , since coarsening dynamics are robust under moderate variation of this parameter ( see figure s3 in the supplementary materials ) .",

    "the cpm models mass transfer as voxel transfer .",
    "the transfer of mass between two bubbles in contact across a thin wall obeys fick s law in both cpm and experiment , so the key question is the rate of transfer as a function of parameters . in both experiment and simulation",
    ", we expect the transfer of mass across the plateau borders to be slower than across thin walls .",
    "however , the dependence of the rate of transfer of bubble mass between bubbles via the plateau borders depends less obviously both on model parameters and geometry and is not simple to separate from transfer across thin walls , so both the rate and functional form of the transfer might differ from experiment .",
    "prior work has shown that 2d cpm simulations of wet foams using the current method reproduce the bulk growth behaviors and distribution functions seen in experiments , including their dependence on foam wetness @xcite .",
    "while such agreement shows that the functional form of the mass transfer via plateau borders must be similar in cpm and wet foams , the agreement does not demonstrate that the functional forms are identical , nor how the rate depends on model parameters .",
    "in particular , for foams composed of a gas with fairly low solubility in the liquid phase , we expect gas transport via walls to be much faster than via plateau borders . in our current cpm simulations ,",
    "the interaction range is a significant fraction of the typical plateau - border size , thus we expect the transport rates via walls and plateau borders to be more similar and the difference in growth rate between dry and wet foams to be less pronounced in the simulations than in an experiment with a foam with a low solubility gas phase . in the near future ,",
    "we plan to examine the explicit relationship between plateau border shape , size and model parameters , which will allow us to control the relative transport rates explicitly .",
    "we first relax the starting configuration for @xmath53 mcs , to allow the bubble and liquid volumes and geometries to adjust to generate a foam with the initially specified area distribution , then begin the simulation proper . to ensure that the equilibration of wall and plateau - border shapes is much faster than the rate of mass diffusion , after each 20 mcs of coarsening steps we run at least 10 mcs of relaxation steps , continuing until the number of accepted voxel copies during a relaxation mcs is zero or less than @xmath54 of the number of accepted voxel copies during the previous relaxation mcs . because mass transfer controls the time - scale of coarsening in experiment , with relaxation occuring simultaneously , the simulation time @xmath13 in our graphs",
    "reflects the number of coarsening steps only . during coarsening steps we set @xmath55 so bubble volumes are free to vary and @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 since the volume constraint on the fluid particles increases their pinning to the grid . during relaxation steps , we set @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for each bubble equal to the bubble s volume at the beginning of the step .",
