    "the phase is an essential concept in quantum scattering theory . some key results and techniques , such as partial wave expansion,@xcite and the friedel sum",
    "rule@xcite depend in an explicit manner on the scattering phase .",
    "the friedel sum rule connects the density of states to the charge ( or a charge difference ) of the system via the phase of the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix.@xcite since the friedel phase is related to the density of states it is also connected to thermodynamic statistical mechanics quantities@xcite like the persistent current.@xcite in addition to the total density of states the scattering phases also play an important role in the partial density of states@xcite ( density of states with a preselection or postselection of the incident or exiting quantum channel ) and in transport coefficients like capacitances@xcite and charge relaxation resistances.@xcite    the principal aim of this work is to investigate the behavior of the phase in simple scattering problems as they frequently occur in mesoscopic physics .",
    "in particular we would like to understand which phases are continuous functions of external parameters ( fermi energy , magnetic field or aharonov - bohm flux ) and which phases are permitted to exhibit jumps as a function of the external parameters .",
    "we consider coherent quantum scattering systems connected to two semi - infinite , one - channel leads in the absence of a magnetic field and without spin - orbit scattering .",
    "consider for instance the transmission amplitude @xmath1 which determines the transmitted current amplitude if there is an incident current of unit amplitude .",
    "the transmission amplitude can be expressed in term of its modulus @xmath2 and its phase @xmath3 ,    @xmath4    if as a function of energy @xmath2 is always positive the path of the transmission amplitude will encircle the origin of the complex plane but always stay at a finite distance from it .",
    "an example of such a behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ d.peanu ] . as    a consequence",
    "the phase @xmath3 is a continuous function of the energy .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath2 is zero for a certain value of the external parameter , the path of the transmission amplitude in the complex plain will necessarily pass through the origin .",
    "as a consequence the phase @xmath3 will jump at this energy by @xmath5 .",
    "such a behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ s.egg ] . a specific model giving rise to the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ d.peanu ] is the transmission amplitude of a simple one - dimensional resonant tunnel barrier structure .",
    "the transmission probability never vanishes and the phase @xmath3 is a continuous function of energy which increases in each complete revolution by @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , fig .",
    "2 shows the transmission amplitude for a simple model of a side branch of finite length attached to a perfect wire . the transmission amplitude as function of energy passes through zero and the phase which increases by @xmath5 through each revolution also exhibits a jump of @xmath5 ( or @xmath7 ) bringing the phase back to its origin .",
    "the two models with the very distinctive behavior can be combined and the evolution of the transmission amplitude of such a combined model is shown in fig .",
    "3 . now the graph shows very many revolutions through the origin and occasionally a revolution around the origin .",
    "we believe that this reflects the generic behavior of the transmission amplitude in the complex plane .",
    "obviously the phase of the transmission amplitude in the second example , fig .",
    "2 , since it is not a continuous function , can not play the role of the scattering phase which is used in the friedel sum rule . for a system with a density of states",
    "@xmath8 there must exist a phase which we denote by @xmath9 and which we call the _ friedel phase _ , such that its energy derivative is directly related to the density of states    @xmath10    since the density of states should be a continuous function of the energy for the scattering problems we have in mind , the friedel phase must also be a continuous function of energy .",
    "one aim of our work is to investigate and illustrate the behavior of the different phases @xmath11 and @xmath9 and to investigate their connection to the scattering matrix of the problem .",
    "the problem investigated here is of interest in connection with experiments by yacoby et al.@xcite and schuster et al.@xcite in the experiment of yacoby et al .",
    "an aharonov - bohm ring with a quantum dot was investigated in a two terminal geometry . in a two terminal geometry",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect exhibits a _",
    "parity_:@xcite as function of the aharonov - bohm flux the conductance is either a local minimum at zero flux ( positive parity ) or a local maximum ( negative parity ) . in the experiment of yacoby et al .",
    "it was observed that over a sequence of more than a dozen coulomb blockade peaks the parity changes at each peak in an identical manner .",
    "it is observed that the parity is positive to the left of the coulomb blockade peak and negative to the right of the coulomb blockade peak .",
    "such a behavior is incompatible with a simple resonant tunneling model fig .",
    "[ d.peanu ] but would be in accordance with the evolution of the transmission amplitude shown in fig .",
    "the second important experimental fact is that the phase drops by @xmath5 between coulomb blockade peaks as shown in the experiment of schuster et al . again",
    "this behavior is compatible with fig .",
    "2 but not with fig .",
    "[ d.peanu ] . a number of efforts@xcite have been made to explain the fact that the behavior of the parity is the same at each peak . ref . suggested a screening effect , ref .",
    "alluded to degeneracies , refs . and proposed asymmetric deformation of the dot and repeated tunneling through exactly the _ same _ state .",
    "the same mechanism due to a dot which is only semi - chaotic is supported by silvestrov and imry@xcite who point to the large variation in the lifetime of states in a semi - chaotic dot .",
    "a possible role of zero s of the transmission probability , fig .",
    "2 , was suggested to us in informal communication by levy yeyati@xcite and has since found interest in a number of works.@xcite we mention here especially the work by ryu and cho@xcite who investigate an ab ring with a dot which is also connected to a side branch . apart from ref .",
    "the friedel sum rule has thus far only found interest in the recent work of lee.@xcite the work presented here is in very close connection to the papers by ryu and cho and the paper by lee .",
    "it is possible that the experimental observation of identical behavior over many subsequent conductance peaks is in fact generic ( i.e. is observed for a fully chaotic quantum dot ) and does require a system with special properties which generates tunneling through the same state .",
    "the parity of the ahronov - bohm effect was observed in a multi - channel gaas ring already almost a decade ago in an experiment by ford , washburn and fowler.@xcite in this experiment the ring is coupled to a back gate and the experiments shows wide regions in the gate voltage - magnetic field plane in which the parity of the aharonov - bohm effect remains the same .    in this work",
    "we investigate the various phases of the scattering matrix and their relation to the phases of the transmission amplitude and the friedel phase @xmath3 comparing in detail two simple model systems , a one - dimensional resonant tunneling problem and a perfect wire with a side branch and briefly discuss also the combination of these two models .",
    "we consider systems connected to two semi - infinite , one - dimensional leads . the system itself can be a multi - dimensional , i. e. a quantum dot .",
    "we consider phase - coherent scattering and neglect particle - particle interactions and inelastic scattering effects . in such systems",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath12 in the particle energy @xmath13 is represented as a @xmath14 matrix in which @xmath15 is the reflection amplitude back into the @xmath16-th lead for carriers incident in the @xmath16-th lead ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the transmission amplitude from the @xmath19-th lead to the @xmath16-th lead ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the scattering matrix is an unitary matrix , @xmath21 .",
    "this condition guarantees a conservation of the particle current .",
    "furthermore it implies that the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix @xmath12 are on the unit circle .",
    "therefore the eigen value of the scattering matrix @xmath12 can be represented as @xmath22 with a real quantity @xmath23 @xmath24 ( @xmath17 ) . below",
    "we show that we obtain the friedel sum rule if we define the _ friedel phase",
    "_ @xmath25 by    @xmath26    as for any definition of a phase , eq .",
    "( [ phase.f ] ) , defines the friedel phase only up to a multiple of @xmath5 .",
    "a unitary @xmath14 matrix can be parameterized as follows ,    @xmath27    with real phases @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix @xmath30 are determined by    @xmath31    the eigenvalues are independent of @xmath32 . furthermore if @xmath33 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ phase.f.2 ] ) then a second solution is @xmath34 .",
    "consequently the sum of the two phases of these eigenvalues is @xmath35 . thus according to eq .",
    "( [ phase.f ] ) the friedel phase is given by    @xmath36    apart form a constant @xmath37 the friedel phase is determined only by the phase @xmath38 of the scattering matrix .",
    "in particular , as also emphasized by lee,@xcite it would be incorrect to identify the friedel phase with the argument of the transmission amplitude .",
    "the derivative of the friedel phase @xmath25 with respect to the particle energy @xmath13 can be related to the energy derivatives of the scattering matrix .",
    "the density of states can also be expressed in terms of the scattering matrix.@xcite this gives us a relation which connects the energy derivatives of the friedel phase and the scattering matrix with the density of states ,    @xmath39    integration of this relation over the energy interval @xmath40 $ ] gives the friedel sum rule , which thus states that the difference in phase @xmath41 is equal to the number of particles @xmath42 multiplied by @xmath5 in the system in this energy interval ,    @xmath43    the friedel phase is thus a _ a continuous _ function of energy ( either @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) since the density of states is a continuous function of energy .",
    "another phase which is frequently discussed is the argument @xmath3 of the transmission amplitude defined by eq .",
    "( [ phase.t ] ) . below we will consider only systems with time reversal invariance . for such systems",
    "the scattering matrix is symmetric @xmath46 and consequently @xmath47 or @xmath48 . to be definite , we take , @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the phase of the transmission amplitude is given by    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the step function of @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast to the friedel phase , the phase of the transmission amplitude is thus in general not a continuous function of energy , but exhibits a jump of @xmath5 when @xmath52 changes sign . the friedel phase and the transmission amplitude phase are not completely independent . from eqs .",
    "( [ phase.f.3 ] ) and ( [ phase.t.2 ] ) we find    @xmath53    differentiating eq .",
    "( [ phase.relat ] ) with respect to energy ( or any other variable of interest ) we find ,    @xmath54    where we have used the abbreviation @xmath55 .",
    "( [ phase.relat.2 ] ) shows that only if the condition @xmath56 is satisfied for all values of the parameters is the phase of the transmission amplitudes equal to the friedel phase .",
    "the condition @xmath57 means that the transmission probability @xmath58 is nowhere equal to zero .",
    "therefore it is the existence of zero points of the transmission probability which is at the origin of the difference of the friedel phase and the phase of the transmission amplitude .    to be more precise , in addition to a zero point in the transmission probability",
    ", it is also required that the energy derivative of @xmath59 is non - zero at the transmission zero - points . to see this",
    ", we consider phase changes due to the energy @xmath13 only , and assume that the number of zero points of the transmission probability is finite or countable .",
    "the zero points of the transmission probability determines a sequence of energies which we denote by @xmath60 , @xmath61 . using eqs .",
    "( [ fried ] ) and ( [ phase.relat.2 ] ) we obtain    @xmath62    where the function @xmath63 of @xmath51 is the sign function . it may be noted that the second term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ relat.3 ] ) is zero even at a transmission zero point if @xmath59 is zero at such a point .",
    "however , we expect that such cases are unlikely , and we proceed by assuming that @xmath59 is not zero at any transmission zero point .    to summarize : the friedel phase is a continuous function of energy . on the other hand , the argument of the transmission amplitude , might exhibit jumps .",
    "these conclusions agree with lee.@xcite    7.5 cm",
    "we now discuss , from a general point of view , the conditions which lead to the behavior shown in figs .",
    "[ d.peanu ] , [ s.egg ] and [ c.combin ] .",
    "we consider a set of parameters for which the transmission probability shows a series of peaks as function of energy .",

    "[ d.peanu ] and fig .",

    "let us denote the energy of the @xmath64-th peak in the transmission probability by @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , let us consider the condition    @xmath66    which according to the friedel sum rule implies that one particle is added to the scattering region . using this condition and integrating both sides of eq .",

    "[ egg ] . consequently , there is a profound difference in the behavior of these two systems : whereas , for instance , in a double - barrier scattering problem , we need to increase the energy over two consecutive states to re - arrive at the starting point , for the wire with a side branch an energy increase over one state only is sufficient to bring the system back to the same point",
    ". we also remark that fig .",
    "[ c.combin ] is composed of combinations of the paths shown in figs . [ peanu ] and [ egg ] .",

    "[ peanu ] and [ egg ] .",
    "clearly , both of these models are very particular ( non - generic ) and the question arises how the behavior exemplified by these two simple models shows up in more complicated structures . to examine this question",
    "we now consider a structure which incorporates both the resonant double barrier and the side branch . a schematic illustration of this system is shown in fig .",
    "[ combi ] .",
    "7.7 cm    we use the same potential barrier as in the resonant double barrier structure and the same wave splitter as we used for the description of the wire with the side branch .",

    "[ c.combin ] . here ,",
    "the parameters chosen for fig . [ c.combin ] are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath150 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "this figure shows clearly that a more general model combines the behavior of the resonant double barrier model and the stub model .",
    "sequences of turns of the transmission amplitude which path through the origin are interrupted by `` double turns '' characteristic of the resonant double barrier in which the transmission amplitude is non - zero . from eq .",
    "( [ c.trans ] ) it can be noted that the wire with scattering and with a side branch has the same zero points for the transmission amplitude as the wire with the side branch .",
    "in this work we have discussed the transmission amplitude as function of energy in the complex plane for scattering systems ( without a magnetic field ) connected to two single channel leads .",
    "we emphasize that there are two phases which are of importance , namely the phase which appears in the friedel sum rule and the phase of the transmission amplitudes . except in special cases ,",
    "these two phases are in general different .",
    "this important point has also been emphasized by lee.@xcite the two phases are different if the transmission amplitude exhibits an energy at which it is zero . at these energies",
    "the transmission amplitude phase and the friedel phase acquire an additional difference given by @xmath0 .",
    "if the transmission amplitude exhibits no zero point between resonances the variation of the phase from one resonant peak to another is close to @xmath5 .",
    "if a zero point exists the phase change between consecutive resonance peaks of the transmission probability is close to @xmath6 .",
    "this difference is shown clearly in the paths of the transmission amplitude in the complex plane .    for a sufficiently general model",
    ", we expect sequences of resonant peaks which are in phase ( the phase increases by @xmath6 ) interrupted by peaks which are out of phase ( the phase increases only by @xmath5 as we go from one peak to the next ) . in terms of the parity of the aharonov - bohm effect , these implies sequences of peaks over which the parity is conserved .",
    "these sequences are interrupted by transitions which generate a flip in the parity .",
    "it is clearly desirable to investigate now a number of statistical questions : for example for a fully chaotic quantum dot one would like to find the ensemble averaged density of zero s and compare this with the ensemble averaged density of states .",
    "furthermore , one would like to know if such a cavity exhibits correlations in the occurrence of zero s ( long sequences of zero s interrupted by a flip in the parity ) , etc .",
    "since the distribution of eigenvalues is known , random matrix theory likely gives an answer to these questions .",
    "we add a remark on fano resonances : fano resonances arise due to the coupling of discrete states with continuous states .",
    "such resonances also exhibit transmission zeros.@xcite consequently , for such resonances the friedel phase also does not coincide with the phase changes of the transmission amplitudes .",
    "the wire with a side branch investigated here also couples a set of discrete states with a continuum and thus provides for interfering transmission paths .",
    "however , the resonances in this case are not of the fano type ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ s.transdensi ] ) but rather breit - wigner resonances in the reflection probability .",
    "it is very interesting to investigate the behavior of the transmission amplitude in the complex plane for variations in parameters other than the energy .",
    "for instance we can ask about the path of the transmission amplitude if the ab flux increases by a flux quantum in a multiply connected geometry .",
    "the additional questions raised in this section clearly demonstrate that the investigation of the path of the transmission amplitude in the complex plane is an interesting avenue of future research .",
