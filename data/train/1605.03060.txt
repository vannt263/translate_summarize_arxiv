    "while long - term potentiation ( ltp ) and long - term depression ( ltd ) are often measurable during memory encoding , the prevailing doctrine that such hebbian changes in synaptic strength entirely explain memory has been challenged by several recent findings . in both _ aplysia _ @xcite and mammalian hippocampal cells @xcite , long - term memory does not in all cases require the persistence of changes in synaptic strength .",
    "the result that deviates the furthest from hebbian theory comes from a recent result in eyeblink conditioning , which showed that a single purkinje cell can memorize a temporal relationship of hundreds of milliseconds between two inputs @xcite .    if a conditional stimulus ( cs ) , such as a tone , is repeatedly followed by a blink - eliciting unconditional stimulus ( us ) , with a fixed temporal delay ( the interstimulus interval or isi ) , a blink response to the cs develops .",
    "this conditioned response ( cr ) occurs just before the expected us onset for isis from @xmath0100 ms to seconds @xcite .",
    "the underlying learning occurs in a specific microzone within the c3 zone of cerebellar cortical lobule hvi @xcite . because many and diverse conditional stimuli may predict the same unconditional stimulus",
    ", the association - forming mechanism should exhibit extensive fan - in , which the purkinje cell indeed does ; its vast dendritic arbor gets cs input from approximately 200,000 parallel fibers @xcite that come from the tiny and densely packed granule cells ( grc ) in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex , while it gets us input from a single climbing fiber @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ circuit ] ) that contacts the entire arbor @xcite .",
    "purkinje cells , which are the sole output of the cerebellum , have high tonic firing rates due to an internal pacemaker mechanism @xcite . given cs - us pairings , blink - controlling purkinje cells learn an adaptively timed pause response @xcite in their tonic inhibition of a motor pathway @xcite .",
    "this learned pause mirrors the known features of behavioral crs .",
    "it is extinguished during repeated cs alone presentations and it is rapidly re - acquired @xcite .",
    "the pause is always adaptively timed , reaches its maximal amplitude just before the predicted onset of the us , and ends shortly after , even if the cs lasts only a few milliseconds or outlasts the isi by hundreds of milliseconds @xcite . in temporal uncertainty paradigms where mixed trials of different isis are used , multiple temporally locked pause responses to the same cs",
    "are learned @xcite .",
    "importantly , the behavioral lower limit of a minimal isi of @xmath0100 ms holds at the level of the single purkinje cell @xcite .",
    "contemporary modeling is dominated by the idea of the granular layer network generating a passage - of - time ( pot ) representation . @xcite . before learning",
    ", the purkinje cell is assumed to fire at its tonic rate due to net excitation from the balanced activity of excitatory granule cells and inhibitory basket / stellate interneurons @xcite . in response to a cs drive from the mossy fibers , time - variance in granule cell ( grc ) activity",
    "is assumed to arise from fast and partly lateral feedback inhibition from golgi cell interneurons .",
    "the effect would be a series of random transitions between activity and quiescence in each granule cell , creating instantaneous population vectors that represent time .",
    "spike - timing dependent plasticity then selectively recruits ltd for those grc - to - purkinje cell synapses most activated by the cs around the time of us onset .",
    "the parallel fiber - purkinje cell synapse is anti - hebbian in that correlated excitatory inputs from parallel fibers and the climbing fiber causes ltd .",
    "ltd tips the balance of afferent activity towards net inhibition near expected us onset , so that , after learning , the cs alone initiates a well - timed pause in purkinje cell firing .",
    "granule cell pot models can not readily be reconciled with two recent results , one physiological and one computational . on the physiological side ,",
    "johansson and colleagues showed that the purkinje cell itself learns the isi @xcite .",
    "they bypassed the granular layer network by delivering the cs directly to the parallel fibers .",
    "purkinje cells learned well - timed pause responses to isis of 150 , 200 and 300 ms .",
    "furthermore , both gaba - ergic interneurons @xcite and glutamatergic ampa receptors @xcite could be blocked without disrupting the pause response .",
    "their result implies that the precisely timed purkinje cell activity depends upon an internal timing mechanism that measures and stores temporal duration .",
    "the computational process embodied by this internal mechanism deviates significantly from that of previous pot models .",
    "after training , the purkinje cell can produce a well - timed pause given only the initial ( @xmath1 ms ) part of the cs @xcite .",
    "for example,@xcite found that drastically varying the cs on probe trials ( 17.5 - 800 ms , 100 - 400 hz ) had no effect on the learned pause .",
    "existing pot models , on the other hand , require the probe stimulus to endure for at least as long as the training stimulus .",
    "for , as soon as the probe terminates , afferent activity would shift to its pre - stimulation conditions and return the net input of the purkinje cell to excitation , preventing pause expression .",
    "the real computational process underlying the cr must contain a strong non - linearity which switches the purkinje cell from a tonic spiking state to a pause - expressing state .",
    "hence , we see two crucial criteria for the modeling of a purkinje cell timing mechanism :    * physiological : * the neural machinery for pause learning and expression must be contained in the purkinje cell itself .",
    "* computational : * the computational process initiating pause expression must be gated by a strong non - linearity or `` switch '' .",
    "this second criterion has new neurobiological underpinning in the work of @xcite , who found that nanoliter injections of antagonists of the inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 ( mglur7 ) , targeted at the purkinje cell dendrites , eliminates the pause response .",
    "this suggests that mglur7 elicits the response through activation of protein - activated , hyperpolarizing k@xmath2 channels in the family kir3 or through inactivation of camp or ca@xmath3 signaling .",
    "in other words , pause expression may be gated by a metabotropic switch .",
    "though this hypothesis may explain what triggers pause expression , it does not explain the temporal structure of the pause itself or how this structure is learned . an actual trained purkinje cell receiving a parallel fiber signal , produces a pause in firing with a slightly delayed onset , accurately timed maximum and critically timed offset .",
    "@xcite provided a conceptual theory for how such a timing mechanism could work .",
    "they suggested a selection mechanism whereby cs onset prompts the purkinje cell to release a batch of evolving `` recorder units '' .",
    "these units could be second messengers , some unknown molecular switches , polynucleotides or evolving proteins .",
    "the precise biophysical identity of recorder units does not substantially affect the theory of @xcite ; the only crucial feature of these units is that they evolve through different time - encoding states beginning at cs onset .",
    "each unit contributes to inhibition of the cell at the interval that it encodes , and the strength of inhibition at any given time since cs is encoded by the quantity of units that encode the same interval , which increases via repeated exposure to cs - us pairs .",
    "recorder units thus constitute an intracellular pot representation .",
    "importantly , this model satisfies the two above criteria : the pause mechanism is internal to the purkinje cell and it is mediated by a glutamatergic switch .",
    "below , this theory is instantiated as a computational model with two parts : a `` write '' module , which intracellularly records the interstimulus interval and a `` read '' module , which translates the archived intervals into a timed hyperpolarization event .",
    "these states become active only when afferent activity switches the cell from its passive off state to its active on state .",
    "we trained this model cell with several paradigms typical to the eyeblink conditioning literature and found :    * given isis ranging from 100 ms to 500 ms , the cell learns a pause response with critically timed onset , maximum and offset , as in @xcite . * after training , the cell produces the learned pause given only the initial part of the cs , as in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . *",
    "the learned pause is extinguished by cs - only trials in about as much time as initial acquisition , as in @xcite . *",
    "alternating isis across trials teaches the cell two pauses , as in @xcite .    additionally , we ran two simulations , which , to our knowledge , have not been tested on the biological purkinje cell",
    ". first , we tried stimulating the cell with two - part css or two - part uss on each trial : stimuli consisted of two impulse trains to the same fiber separated by a period of silence , so that the cell was effectively exposed to two isis . in these simulations , our model cell only learns one isi .",
    "next , we tried varying the intertrial interval ( iti ) along with the isi .",
    "we found that time to pause acquisition in all simulations was a function of both of these temporal quantities .",
    "the behavior of this formal model may help to inform future electrophysiology .",
    "_ model structure_. the purkinje cell has two computational goals .",
    "first , it must record or `` write '' an isi into memory .",
    "second , it must `` read '' this isi into a well - timed pause . as stated above , the purkinje cell only transitions from its passive spiking behavior to its active read",
    "/ write behavior when some type of switch is activated .",
    "thus , we may formally model the cell as having two modules ( read / write ; fig .",
    "[ model ] , top vs. bottom row ) which can be in two states ( off / on ; fig . [ model ] , left vs. right column ) . before cs stimulation , both the read and write modules are off and the cell spikes at its tonic rate .",
    "when pre - synaptic spikes arrive at the cell , a quantity called `` activation energy '' ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) begins to increase . when @xmath4 reaches a threshold value , the write module switches to the on state . a refractory timer on this switch",
    "is then reset so that the cell is insensitive to the cs for a given period .",
    "when the write module is activated after sufficient cs stimulation , a batch of `` recorder units '' is released from a `` reserve '' .",
    "these units are a formal abstraction meant to stand for whatever process encodes the pot within the purkinje cell .",
    "the reserve is a way of imagining these units before the write module is activated .",
    "after some recorder units have been released from the archive , the reserve begins to replenish at a constant rate .",
    "the released recorder units evolve through states in a way that mirrors the passage of time .",
    "for example , if they can encode four states , @xmath6 ms , @xmath7 ms , @xmath8 ms , and @xmath9 ms , then the pot is represented by the sequential evolution of the recorder units @xmath10 .",
    "units in the reserve encode 0 ms .",
    "( upper box ) .",
    "@xmath4 is increased with each cs spike ( blue circle ) and is otherwise subject to a passive decay . only when @xmath4 reaches a threshold ( diamond ) does the cell transition to the write / on state .",

    ", the unit introduces a fixed inhibitory current to the membrane ( purple circle ) . ]    at us onset , this evolution stops and the batch of recorder units is stored in an `` archive '' .",
    "again , this archive is simply a way of imagining the units after their evolution has been terminated by us onset ( unless us onset is too early , for reasons discussed below ) .",
    "we assume that the evolution of the batch is noisy , so that , when the evolution stops , there are some units in each state .",
    "thus , the stored batch is a histogram which constitutes an estimate on the isi .",
    "for example , if the isi is 200 ms , then there will be some units in states @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "we choose to imagine the recording medium as consisting of many individual `` units '' , since we want to use a stored histogram ( which displays the frequencies of many elements or samples ) to estimate the isi .",
    "the routine of write / off @xmath14 write / on @xmath14 store batch is repeated with each cs presentation , as long as they are spaced far enough apart to respect the refractory timer on the write module . with each presentation , a batch of recorder units is released , evolves and is stored in the archive , updating the total number of recorder units in the archive encoding each time value .",
