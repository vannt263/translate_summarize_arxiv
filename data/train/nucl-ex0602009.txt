    "at present , the two neutrino double beta ( @xmath11 ) decay process has been detected in a total of 10 different nuclei . in @xmath4mo and @xmath7nd ,",
    "this type of decay was also detected for the transition to the @xmath12 excited state of the daughter nucleus . for the case of the @xmath10ba nucleus , evidence for the two neutrino double electron capture process",
    "was observed via a geochemical experiment .",
    "all of these results were obtained in a few tens of geochemical experiments , more then twenty direct ( counting ) experiments , and in one radiochemical experiment . in direct experiments , for some nuclei there are as many as seven independent positive results ( e.g. , @xmath4mo ) . in some experiments ,",
    "the statistical error does not always play the primary role in overall half - life uncertainties .",
    "for example , the nemo-3 experiment with @xmath4mo detected more than 219000 useful events @xcite , which results in a value for the statistical error of @xmath130.2% .",
    "at the same time , the systematic error in many other experiments on @xmath11 decay generally remains quite high ( @xmath14 ) and very often can not be determined very reliably . as a result , it is frequently quite difficult for the `` user '' to select the `` best '' half - life value among all existing results .",
    "in fact , however , using an averaging procedure , one can produce reliable and accurate half - life values for each isotope .    in the present work , a critical analysis of all `` positive '' experimental results has been performed , and averaged ( or recommended ) values for all isotopes have been obtained .",
    "the first time that this type of work was done was in 2001 , and the results were presented at medex01 @xcite . in the present paper , new positive results obtained since 2001 have been added and analyzed .    [ table1 ]        ' '' ''    nucleus & n & @xmath15 , y & s / b & ref .",

    "there are three independent counting experiments and many geochemical measurements @xmath100 .",

    "@xcite that if the weak interaction constant @xmath101 is time - dependent , then the half - life values obtained in geochemical experiments will depend on the age of the samples .",

    "there are only geochemical data for these isotopes.te in a direct experiment was published , @xmath109\\cdot 10^{20}$ ] y @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with the `` lower '' geochemical value , but is not very precise or reliable . ]",
    "although the half - life ratio for these isotopes has been obtained with good accuracy @xmath110 @xcite , the absolute values for @xmath15 of the individual nuclei are different from one experiment to the next .",
    "one group of authors @xcite gives @xmath111 y for @xmath10te and @xmath112 y for @xmath9te , whereas another group @xcite claims @xmath113 y and @xmath114 y , respectively .",
    "furthermore , as a rule , experiments with `` young '' samples ( @xmath16 million years ) result in half - life values of @xmath10te in the range of @xmath115 y , while for `` old '' samples ( @xmath116 billion years ) , half - life values in the range of @xmath117 y have been produced .",
    "it was even assumed that the difference in half - life values could be connected with a variation of the weak interaction constant @xmath101 with time @xcite .",
    "we will estimate the absolute half - life values for @xmath10te and @xmath9te using only very well - known ratios from geochemical measurements and the `` present '' half - life value of @xmath2se ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the first ratio is given by @xmath118 @xcite , while the second ratio is given by @xmath119 .",
    "this latter value is the weighted average value from three experiments with minerals containing both elements ( te and se ) : @xmath120 @xcite , @xmath121 @xcite and @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "it is significant that the gas retention age problem has no effect on the half - life ratios .",
    "now , using the `` present '' @xmath2se half - life value @xmath123 y and the value @xmath124 for the @xmath125 ratio , one can obtain the half - life value for @xmath10te : @xmath126    using @xmath118 @xcite , one can obtain the half - life value for @xmath9te : @xmath127    the half - life value was measured in three independent experiments @xcite .",
    "however , only the latter two results are in good agreement . using equation 1 , and three existing values one can obtain @xmath128 y. taking into account the fact that @xmath129 and s = 2.2 ( see equation 2 ) we finally obtain : @xmath130    .",
    "there is only one positive result from a direct ( counting ) experiment @xcite : @xmath131    .",
    "there is only one positive result from a radiochemical experiment @xcite : @xmath132    .",
    "there is only one positive result from a geochemical experiment @xcite : @xmath133",
    "in summary , all `` positive '' @xmath11-decay results were analyzed and average values for half - lives were calculated . for the cases of @xmath9te , @xmath10te , and @xmath10ba ,",
    "so - called `` recommended ''",
    "values have been proposed .",
    "we strongly recommend the use of these values as presently the most precise and reliable .",
    "in particular , the accurate experimental @xmath11-decay rates can be used to adjust the most relevant parameter in the framework of the qrpa model , namely the strength of the particle - particle interaction ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "once accomplished , these values can be used in nme calculations for neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .",
