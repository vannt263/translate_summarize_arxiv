    "the dark energy problem continues to be a sticking point for theoretical physicists .",
    "the simplest solution to this problem is to postulate the existence of a vacuum energy or cosmological constant which agrees with all the current observational bounds @xcite .",
    "however we are then left with a secondary problem , namely explaining why the vacuum energy is tuned to such a small value without some obvious symmetry to protect it . for many years",
    "we have hoped that uv complete theories of gravity would shed light on this issue , which is in effect an extremely embarrassing ir problem from this perspective . however despite much effort , neither string theory nor loop quantum gravity has shed any compelling light on this issue - although there have been many interesting proposals .",
    "an alternative approach is to assume that the cosmological constant is exactly zero , since supersymmetry can then be invoked as the regulating symmetry in this case .",
    "however one then has to account for the fact that low - energy supersymmetry must be broken and an alternative explanation for the current expansion must be sought .",
    "one way to deal with the latter problem is to assume that the dark energy phase is driven by a dynamical field , implying that the equation of state is an explicit function of time @xcite .",
    "currently this can not be ruled out by our best observations and therefore remains a possible solution to the dark energy problem .",
    "however one can not just consider ad hoc scalar fields coupling to gravity , since the low energy theory will still be sensitive to high energy physics .",
    "in particular we must ensure that any additional scalars are neutral under all the standard model symmetries , and that they do not introduce additional fifth forces .",
    "therefore one must search for viable models of dynamical dark energy within uv sensitive theories .",
    "phenomenological models of our universe have proven difficult to construct within string theory , due to technical difficulties arising from moduli stabilization , whereby we assume that the extra dimensions of the theory are compactified on manifolds with @xmath6 structure ( in the type iib case ) @xcite , and orientifolded to preserve the minimal amount of supersymmetry in four - dimensions . as a result ,",
    "embedding realistic cosmology into string theory has proven difficult .",
    "one area which has been well explored in recent years , is inflation driven by the open string sector through dynamical @xmath7-branes .",
    "this is the so - called dbi inflation @xcite - which lies in a special class of k - inflation models .",
    "it was originally thought that such models yielded large levels of non - gaussian perturbations which could be used as a falsifiable signature of string theory @xcite .",
    "however subsequent work has shown that this is may not be the case , and that the simplest dbi models are essentially indistinguishable from standard field theoretic slow roll models @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the wmap @xmath8 year data set @xcite imposes very tight constraints on the allowed tuning of the free parameters in the theory .",
    "we are then left with the choice of either having large non - gaussianities but with vanishing tensors , or assume that the tensor spectrum will be visible - in which case there is no non - gaussian signature .",
    "the models are only falsifiable once these conditions are relaxed .",
    "one can get around these conditions by considering more complicated models such as multiple fields @xcite , multiple branes @xcite , wrapped branes @xcite or monodromies @xcite - but even here there are still problems with fine tuning , backreaction and the apparent breakdown of perturbation theory in the inflationary regime @xcite .    in models of dynamical dark energy , on the other hand @xcite , the wmap constraints can be relaxed and therefore dbi models may still have some use as an explanation for a dynamical equation of state .",
    "moreover this fits in nicely with several intuitive ideas from string theory .",
    "namely that inflation can still occur , albeit only through the closed string sector - where one ( or more ) of the geometric pseudo - moduli are actually responsible for the initial inflationary epoch ( see @xcite for the phenomenologically most viable proposals ) .",
    "after inflation the universe lives on branes that wrap various cycles within the compact space and are extended along the large minkowski directions . in this sense we see that a gut or electro - weak ( ew ) phase transition can manifest through a geometric fashion - namely the higgsing of branes in the compact bulk space .",
    "this suggests that dark energy may well be a dynamical process , and moreover in the light of these open string constructions , retains a sense of being geometric in nature .    with this in mind ,",
    "various authors have begun to explore the phase space of dbi - driven dark energy @xcite .",
    "the initial works have dealt with the dynamics of a solitary @xmath9-brane moving through a particular warped compactification of type iib . in this note",
    "we wish to generalise this further to a more phenomenological class of models that include multiple and partially wrapped branes .",
    "we believe that this may be a more generic situation to consider , since typically one should expect branes of varying degrees to be wrapped on non - trivial cycles of the compact space .",
    "our work is a first step into considerations of a more general set - up for quintessence in iib ( open)-string theory , and we hope will be a valuable starting point for further endeavour .",
    "to begin let us assume that the the universe at such late times can be adequately described by a flat frw metric and the matter sector consists of a dynamical scalar field and a perfect fluid , which are both separately conserved .",
    "the usual cosmological equations of motion are therefore independent of any particular model and can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 runs over the contributing components .",
    "the equation of state is given by @xmath12 , however if @xmath13 of the fluid component is assumed to be constant then we can integrate the appropriate conservation equation exactly to obtain @xmath14 where the scale factor varies as a function of time such that @xmath15)}$ ] .",
    "the model dependence arises in the parameterisation of the scalar field sector . in our case",
    "we are assuming that the dark energy is driven by open string modes , which at low energies are described by fluctuations of a @xmath7-brane whose dynamics are governed by the dirac - born - infeld action ( dbi ) - which is a generalisation of non - linear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "typically one assumes that the standard model is localised on an intersecting brane stack , in one of the many warped throats that are attached to the internal space . for consistency reasons in the simplest cases ,",
    "these are taken to be either @xmath9 or @xmath16-branes . in this note",
    "we will consider a bottom up approach therefore we shall not worry too much about the geometric deformations of the compact space , nor any constraints imposed by orientifold @xmath17-planes - aside from those that ensure that all tadpoles are consistently canceled so that we can trust the low energy supergravity theory .    the action we consider is a generalised form of the dbi one coupled to einstein - hilbert gravity , which can be embedded into this background and takes the following generalised form is a matrix valued field . for recent work in a related direction see @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the warped tension of the brane and @xmath20 is the action for matter localised in the standard model ( sm ) sector .",
    "thus our assumption here is that our dynamical open string sector is coupled only gravitationally to the sm sector and so we do not have to worry about additional forces or particle production .",
    "there are two potential terms for the scalar field which are denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the first of these terms can arise in different places within the theory .",
    "firstly if the brane is actually a non - bps one @xcite , then the scalar field mode is actually tachyonic and the potential is therefore of the usual runaway form .",
    "if there are @xmath23 multiple coincident branes , then the world - volume field theory is a @xmath24 non - abelian gauge theory and the potential term is simply a reflection of the additional degrees of freedom @xcite . through the dielectric effect",
    ", one can also see that this configuration is related to a @xmath25-brane wrapping a two - cycle within the compact space and carrying a non - zero magnetic flux along this cycle . both of these configurations lead to an additional potential multiplying the usual dbi kinetic term .",
    "the origin of the @xmath22 term is less explicit - but is a sum of terms .",
    "one expects open or closed string interactions to generate a scalar potential @xmath26 , however the precise form of such an interaction depends upon many factors such as the number of additional branes and geometric moduli , the number of non - trivial cycles in the compact space , and the choice of embedding for branes on these cycles . typically one can only compute this in special cases in the full string theory",
    "there are also additional terms coming from coupling of the brane to any background rr form fields .",
    "the action above is assumed to be that of @xmath9-brane(s ) filling the space - time directions , which naturally couple to the field @xmath27 through the chern - simons part of the action .",
    "however for wrapped @xmath25-branes there is also the possibility of a coupling @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the magnetic field through the two - cycle .",
    "for example in the warped deformed conifold one can see that @xmath30 and therefore there is an additional term in the dbi action @xmath31 up to a normalisation factor of order one .",
    "terms such as this have been added to the interaction potential to define the _ full _ scalar potential @xmath22 .",
    "recent extensions to standard dbi inflation have included the contribution from higher dimensional bulk forms , with the remarkable result that they cancel one another up to third order in the action and therefore do not affect the leading order perturbations @xcite .",
    "extending this work to higher order is therefore extremely interesting .    the corresponding equations for the energy density and pressure of the dbi",
    "can then be written succinctly as @xmath32   - \\tilde v(\\phi)\\ , , \\hspace{0.5 cm } \\rho_{\\phi}= t(\\phi)\\left[w(\\phi)\\gamma-1 \\right ] + \\tilde v(\\phi)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath33^{-1/2}$ ] is the usual generalisation of the relativistic factor .",
    "the subscript @xmath34 denotes the scalar field component here .",
    "we can also immediately define the equation of state parameter for the quintessence field to be @xmath35-\\tilde v(\\phi ) \\gamma}{t(\\phi)\\gamma\\left[w(\\phi)\\gamma-1\\right]+\\tilde v(\\phi)\\gamma}\\,,\\ ] ] from which one clearly sees that it is dynamically sensitive and can take a wide range of values .",
    "for instance we only recover @xmath36 in the limit that the field is non - relativistic and the entire solution is dominated by the @xmath22 terms - which will clearly require large amounts of fine tuning to accomplish .",
    "there are clearly several regions of parameter space that are of interest .",
    "first let us assume that the potential term is zero , either because it is suppressed or there is an unlikely cancellation between the contributing terms .",
    "the more general case with non - zero @xmath37 leads to a wide variety of complex behaviour .",
    "we can therefore identify several limits of interest - focusing on the behaviour of @xmath38 :    * @xmath39 - which reduces the action back to the usual dbi case which has @xmath40 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "* @xmath41 - which leads to constant @xmath42 if @xmath43 is constant , since the two are related via @xmath44 .",
    "moreover this again means that @xmath45 as in the case where @xmath46 . *",
    "@xmath47 - as could occur in the case of a tachyonic theory , which mimics a dark energy dominates phase with @xmath48",
    ". however one must be careful if this is to be representative of non - bps @xmath49-brane actions , since the coupling to the form field is non canonical in this instance .",
    "in fact the coupling term will typically be of the form @xmath50 .",
    "this means that there is no solitary @xmath19 term in the action and therefore the equation of state in this instance will vary like @xmath51 .",
    "* @xmath52 - which can occur in the multi - brane / wrapped brane case and yields @xmath53 .",
    "note that in all cases the equation of state parameter remains bounded between @xmath54 .",
    "one can combine the expressions for the energy - momentum tensor components , and together with the continuity equation we obtain the following equation of motion - assuming that the scalar field follows a monotonic path @xmath55 which is a generalisation of the klein - gordon equation for the dbi lagrangian .",
    "the subscript @xmath56 of @xmath57 and @xmath58 denotes derivative with respect to the field value .",
    "the other dynamical equation of motion for the hubble parameter can be written as @xmath59\\,,\\ ] ] where we have defined the pressure of the barotropic fluid to be @xmath60 and that it is non - interacting .",
    "we leave the interesting case of interacting pressure for future endeavour .",
    "let us consider , as an example solution , the case where there is a scaling solution with @xmath46 , which has been reviewed elsewhere @xcite",
    ". we will find it convenient to define the quantity @xmath61 in which case we see that @xmath62 .",
    "this allows us to reconstruct the tension of the brane as follows @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a dimensionful mass scale , @xmath65 is a constant and @xmath66 . using the fact that @xmath67 we can then see that for @xmath68 the solution is physically valid only when @xmath69 since we define @xmath42 to be the positive root .",
    "let us now consider the phase - space dynamics of the theory in more detail following along the lines of @xcite .",

    "we will consider this case as the simplest ( canonical ) example .",
    "if we wish to appeal to string theoretic constructions then we restrict the parameter space of solutions .",
    "it is more interesting to consider the above equations in the context of a phenomenological model and see what kind of functions yield the correct behaviour .",
    "explicit constructions of string backgrounds are typically difficult and there are only a few well known examples that are ritually invoked , however if we take string theory seriously then there are undoubtedly other non - trivial backgrounds that are cosmologically interesting but not yet constructed . since an analytic analysis of this generalised system is highly complicated , it is convenient to use a combination of analytic and numerical methods to understand the dynamics of the system . for a numeric analysis",
    "it is necessary to re - write the fluid equation in terms of more useful variables .",
    "it turns out that the simplest variables to use are the following @xmath80 which are easily derivable from the terms written above .",
    "the equations ( [ hdash ] ) , ( [ zdash ] ) , ( [ mudash ] ) , ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) together with barotropic fluid equation : @xmath81 , hence form a closed ten - dimensional autonomous system if @xmath57 or @xmath58 are given as explicit functions of @xmath82 or as constants .",
    "let us take the canonical string theoretic example arising when the local geometry can be approximated by an @xmath83 space .",
    "this geometry typically arises in the near horizon limit of coincident @xmath9-branes ( or flux ) . in this case",
    "we see that ( at leading order ) @xmath84 where we have also included an effective @xmath85 potential for the system .",
    "this means that @xmath86 and we also have a constant @xmath87 which allows us to write the remaining @xmath88 terms as @xmath89 and therefore the dynamical equations reduce to @xmath90 the simplest way to proceed with the analysis is to consider the final equation above , since this splits the solution space neatly into two components .",
    "thus we search for solutions where either @xmath91 or @xmath92 as initial conditions .",
    "the first sub - set of solutions admits @xmath93 as a ( trivial ) fixed point , which is a fluid dominated solution since @xmath94 in this instance .",
    "let us remark here that this fixed point solution will occur for _ all _ the cases we consider , however since this implies a vanishing of the action , causality implies that this fixed point must be unstable - i.e. phase space trajectories will flow away from it . by making this field a phantom scalar , one can evade this causal bound and the point can become a stable fixed point .",
    "this behaviour arises in many places in the literature , so we will not discuss it further here .",
    "there is also a critical point at @xmath95 which is a kinetic dominated solution .",
    "this solution actually exists as solutions to the quadratic expression @xmath96 which corresponds to the limit @xmath97 . in terms of the density parameter",
    ", a quick calculation shows that along the general curve ( parameterised by @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) we find @xmath100 .",

    "we also find @xmath104 as expected from the cosmological evolution equations .",
    "again due to the special algebraic properties of the dbi action , we anticipate that this solution will also be found for the other cases of interest .",
    "the second sub - set of solutions are more interesting , as initially one can solve the system by slicing the phase space at @xmath105 . since the action becomes singular and ill - defined .",
    "] one can use the condition on @xmath106 to fix @xmath107 through @xmath108 .",
    "combining this with the equations of motion gives us the following fixed point ( taking positive signs of all roots for simplicity ) @xmath109 which is valid for all @xmath110 in order for these points to be real and at finite distance in phase space . if we then compute the density of the fluid we find @xmath111 , since @xmath112 , which corresponds to a purely dust - like solution",
    "note that this class of solutions does not exist for the simple @xmath9-brane analysis as in @xcite , since it arises from additional degrees of freedom which are neglected in these models . the remaining solutions in this sub - set are difficult to find analytically .",
    "more generally we can see that the above solution corresponds is a special case of the more general case i behavior , which we paramaterise by @xmath113 where we can then explicitly write @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a ( real , positive ) constant provided that @xmath116 . @xmath117 but which simplifies in the limit @xmath118 . as before ,",
    "the solution space splits into two disconnected sub - sets , therefore in the first instance where we take slices through @xmath91 , we find the following bound @xmath119 which implies that @xmath120 and so the brane tension should dominate the dynamics ( in the large field regime ) .",
    "let us therefore assume that @xmath121 are chosen such that this condition is satisfied - then we find the solution branch is governed again by the relation @xmath122 as expected - which contains the solution @xmath93 as a special case .",

    "what is also obvious is that demanding @xmath189 leads to a novel fixed point at @xmath190 regardless of the ratio @xmath191 .",
    "using the definition of @xmath115 this fixes @xmath192 and therefore @xmath38 is vanishingly small unless the scalar takes is trans - planckian .",

    "let us again start with the simplest solution slices at @xmath91 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath209 and @xmath210 readily simplify in this instance , however the equation for @xmath211 requires us to be more careful .",
    "we see that in order for the @xmath212 term to vanish in this limit we require @xmath213 .",

    "let us therefore assume that @xmath240 and re - do the analysis .",
    "we then find that the @xmath134 is perfectly valid , and moreover the parameters @xmath241 are not divergent provided that the parameters satisfy @xmath242 .",

    "if we search for solutions along the @xmath105 slicing things are again complicated .",
    "however we can simplify things by identifying @xmath245 , since we can then solve explicitly for @xmath246 via @xmath247 the remaining equation coming from @xmath248 has several solutions . the simplest being @xmath249 which give rise to the points @xmath250 however the first of these conditions also requires that @xmath251 for the solution to be real .",

    "note that these are the leading order solutions only , and that all terms proportional to @xmath271 have been neglected .",
    "the stability of the fixed point solutions is therefore determined by the eigenvalues of the resulting perturbation matrix .",
    "a lengthy calculation which we will omit here shows that the point @xmath93 leads to the eigenvalues @xmath272 which indicates that this is never a point of stability for the theory unless the equation of state is phantom ie @xmath273 .",
    "in fact this statement will be true for all the various cases we have considered in the physical limit , since the dynamical equations of motion all reduce to the exact same form in this instance .",
    "another relatively simple case to consider is that in case iii . for slices through the ( @xmath274 ) plane at @xmath275",
    "we find the eigenvalues @xmath276 if one now slices this through @xmath277 we see that we are left with the same situation discussed above ( as expected ) , indicative of a phantom equation of state .    on the other hand , through the @xmath277 plane we see that the eigenvalues become @xmath278 where @xmath29 is another polynomial in @xmath279 and we have defined @xmath280 for simplicity . in the limit that @xmath281 , we find that these simplify to yield @xmath282 note that two of the eigenvalues are therefore degenerate as before , requiring a phantom equation of state , however the final eigenvalue has the opposite sign and therefore this fixed point is always unstable .",
    "the remaining fixed points can be analyzed in precisely the same manner , although the analysis is somewhat awkward .",
    "we will postpone the relevant discussion here and return to it in a follow - up publication .",
    "we have initiated an alternate approach to the problem of k - essence , or dbi quintessence @xcite , using a more generalised form of the dbi action .",
    "since this has more degrees of freedom , the resulting analysis is typically complicated , but the phase space structure is far richer .",
    "we have attempted to make some headway by restricting the phase space volume to various two - dimensional slices , and attempting to identify the relevant solution curves upon which the fixed points may lie .",
    "our ansatz for each of the unknown functions is also potentially restrictive , however we are confident that it represents the leading semi - classical contributions which may ( or may - not ) be derivable from a full string theory embedding of out model .",
    "what is clear is that the ratio of the ( warped ) brane tension to the potential is an important factor in the dynamics of the theory , where we found @xmath283 in several cases .",
    "moreover the additional multiplicative factor @xmath21 plays a crucial role , even when it is a constant , since it comes into the field equations non - trivially in the expression for @xmath260 . in the usual dbi analysis ,",
    "@xmath46 and the tension is the sole term responsible for the interesting quintessence behaviour . in some string compactifications , where the warp factor has no cut - off at small distances , we typically find @xmath38 is constant and greater than unity",
    ". however there may be entire classes of solution where @xmath284 , which can lead to novel phase space trajectories .",
    "since our approach has been phenomenological , and that there may be additional string backgrounds of interest that have yet to be fully explored , we can not rule out @xmath110 - which is vital for obtaining fixed point solutions in case i for example .",
    "our numerical results have shown that there is indeed a rich phase space structure present due to the increased number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we expect many of these to yield highly non - trivial stable fixed points in the full analysis , which is beyond the scope of the current note .",
    "we have classified the nature of as many of the fixed points as is feasible within the current analysis .",
    "ultimately we hope that this will lead to a renewed interest in dynamical dark energy models driven by a more generalised approach to @xmath9-brane dynamics .    in light of the recent developments in holographic dark energy @xcite and the apparent relation to agegraphic @xcite dark energy",
