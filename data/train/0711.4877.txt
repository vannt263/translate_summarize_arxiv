    "we thus introduce the intermediate partial wave cutoff @xmath34 ( a large , but finite value of @xmath22 ) and express the fully renormalized effective action by two separate terms @xmath35",

    "@xcite ; for this , we made essential use of the quantum mechanical radial wkb expansion and the euler - maclaurin summation formula .",
    "a crucial observation is that even though the partial - wave sum in ( [ finitepart ] ) is quadratically divergent as we let @xmath44 , this divergence is _ exactly cancelled _ by a similar term originating from the second term @xmath43 in ( [ infinitepart ] ) in the large @xmath34-limit .",
    "thus , for the sum of the two terms , we secure a finite result in the large @xmath34-limit  this is the essence of our numerically accurate scheme for the determination of the renormalized effective action .",

    "clearly , numerical efficiency of our calculational scheme hinges on how quickly the @xmath45 limit is attained ; that is , on how much we can lower our partial wave cutoff @xmath34 to secure a reliable large-@xmath34 limit value for the above sum of the two terms .",
    "( note that if we were able to calculate both parts , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 _ exactly _ , their sum would be independent of the choice of the cutoff value @xmath34 .",

    ", we chose the cutoff value @xmath34 to be rather large ( of the order of 50 ) , and used the richardson extrapolation method @xcite to reduce the numerical round - off error .",
    "there , it was sufficient to use the expression for @xmath43 with @xmath47 or smaller terms suppressed .",
    "but , in the present , more extensive , study , we have found that the computation is greatly improved , both in computing time and precision , by including [ analytically calculated ] higher - order wkb terms in the expression for @xmath43 , so that it becomes valid up to the @xmath48 accuracy .",
    "these higher - order wkb terms can be found straightforwardly from the @xmath49-expansion @xcite for the radial proper - time green function . with this procedure",
    ", we were able to ensure that the renormalized effective action we calculate is independent of the ( moderately large ) @xmath34-value with relative error of order @xmath50 , which is comparable to the final total error involved in our numerical computation of ( [ finitepart ] ) . in the end",

    "this is despite the fact that we have just used the very leading order of the derivative expansion ( [ dexpansion ] ) , in which we simply take the euler - heisenberg constant field result , and then replaced the constant fields by their inhomogeneous forms in the effective lagrangian .",
    "the superiority of the derivative expansion is because the derivative expansion is in fact a resummed version of the large mass expansion ",
    "the large mass expansion is an expansion both in powers of the field and in derivatives of the field , while the derivative expansion is just an expansion in derivatives of the field , with _ all _ terms in the large mass expansion not involving derivatives having been resummed .",

    "to conclude , we have presented explicit computations of the renormalized one loop effective action for gauge field backgrounds that possess a radial symmetry , such that the associated spectral problem can be decomposed into partial waves .",
    "we considered one class of non - abelian backgrounds , and another class of quasi - abelian backgrounds , each characterized by a radial profile function .",
    "the computation has been performed using the partial wave cutoff method developed in @xcite , and we have further refined the numerical efficiency and precision by including higher order terms in the analytic radial wkb expression for the large partial wave contribution .",
    "the main conclusion is that the method works very efficiently and simply . with the incorporation of these higher order analytic terms ,",
    "the numerical part of the computation is simplified because we do not need to take such high partial waves in the numerical computations .",
    "the method is not much more complicated to implement than the derivative expansion or the large mass expansion , and is much more accurate , especially in probing the small mass region .",
    "so , we can now reliably compute the renormalized determinant of any fluctuation problem whenever there is a radial symmetry .",
    "this method has now been tested successfully in gauge theories @xcite and in self - interacting scalar field theories @xcite .",
    "the physical renormalization conditions are quite different in these various theories , but the wkb analysis correctly encodes the renormalization physics in each case .",
    "the method has also motivated a recent extension of the gelfand - yaglom theorem ( for the determinant of ordinary differential operators ) , to partial differential operators that are radially separable @xcite .",
    "an important generalization is to fermion fields .",
    "this can be done by converting the fermion problem to second order form , and then using the scalar method we have described here .",
    "aspects of this idea have been addressed in various approximation schemes @xcite ; however , it should be possible to develop a more direct and numerically exact fermionic approach , along the lines of the scalar partial wave cutoff method described here . finally ,",
    "while the method is restricted to backgrounds for which the fluctuation spectral problem is separable into partial waves , this includes a relatively large class of physically interesting cases , such as vortices , monopoles , and instantons .",
