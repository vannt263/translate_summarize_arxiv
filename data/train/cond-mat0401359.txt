    "bose - einstein condensates of cold atoms represent a remarkable testing ground for theories of weakly interacting bosons . the fact that the actual condensates are spatially confined and inhomogeneous makes these systems even more interesting . from one hand , the bogoliubov theory of uniform gases @xcite can still be applied in certain limits , when the system can be viewed as  locally uniform \" .",
    "such a local density approach has been used , for instance , to characterize the response of a condensate to light scattering processes @xcite . in the same spirit , properties of the uniform gas",
    "can also be extracted from a trapped condensate by reducing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "finite size effects are interesting by themselves , giving rise to a new type of bogoliubov excitations with spatially varying quasiparticle amplitudes , such as the low frequency collective oscillations of the whole condensate ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the axial phonons of elongated condensates , exhibiting a multibranch spectrum @xcite .    in most of the experiments with excited condensates ,",
    "the observations are performed after switching - off the confining potential and letting the condensate to expand .",
    "the comparison between theory and experimental data often ignores the dynamics of the expansion .",
    "this is justified if one looks for quantities that are conserved during the expansion like , for instance , the total momentum of the condensate .",
    "however , the expansion of a condensate initially dressed with phonon - like modes is interesting from both the conceptual and experimental viewpoints .",
    "conceptually , the behavior of an excited state that starts as a quasiparticle and evolves into a particle is a remarkable and nontrivial example of quantum process , which shows some similarities with the quantum evaporation process at the surface of superfluid helium @xcite and with the evolution of two - level systems with nonhermitian hamiltonian @xcite . from the experimental viewpoint , on the other hand , the characterization of the observable density and velocity distributions of the expanded gas in terms of specific initial configurations is important in order to use those distributions as a probe of in - trap quasiparticles .    in this paper",
    "we use the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) theory to investigate the expansion of elongated axially symmetric condensates .",
    "we assume the initial configuration to be a stationary trapped condensate at zero temperature .",
    "the condensate is excited by populating some quasiparticle states and , then , let to expand .    in section",
    "ii , we first present the results of numerical simulations based on the direct integration of the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation in the case of an elongated condensate similar to the one of recent experiments @xcite .",
    "we show that the expansion exhibits quite different behaviors depending on the wavelength of the initial phonons : i ) long wavelength phonons remain inside the expanding condensate in the form of density modulations ; ii ) short wavelength phonons are converted into a separate cloud of excited atoms moving out of the condensate . in both cases ,",
    "the final density distribution shows nontrivial features , such as a radial distortion of the density modulations in the condensate and a  shell \" structure of the released - phonon cloud .    in section iii",
    ", we use the simplified geometry of an infinite cylindrical condensate in order to get a deeper insight , pointing out the different role of radial and axial degrees of freedom . in this case",
    ", we numerically solve the bogoliubov equations for the amplitudes of in - trap quasiparticles .",
    "then we follow the expansion of a condensate initially dressed with one of these quasiparticles by using the scaling properties of the gp equation in two - dimensions and solving rescaled bogoliubov - like equations .",
    "this approach allows us to characterize the behavior of the excitations during the expansion , at different levels of approximation , and to find the relevant timescales for the evaporation process .",
    "interesting results can also be obtained by averaging out the slow radial motion of the excitations in the rescaled coordinates .",
    "the problem is thus mapped into the evolution of a quasiparticle in a uniform gas with a decreasing time - dependent density . in section iv",
    ", we show that this process can be either adiabatic ( conversion of a quasiparticle into a single particle with the same momentum ) or non - adiabatic depending on the phonon wavelength and on the chemical potential of the gas .    in section",
    "v , we compare the predictions of the rescaled bogoliubov equations for the infinite cylinder with the results of gp simulations for elongated condensates . the comparison is instructive and allows one to relate the properties of in - trap quasiparticles with observable features of the expanded gas . in particular , we discuss the axial motion of density modulations , the radial scaling of nodal lines , the conditions for the appearance of a separate released - phonon cloud and for the adiabaticity of the quasiparticle evaporation process .    the expansion of condensates with long wavelength phonons was previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where random phase fluctuations were included in the configuration of a very elongated condensate at the beginning of the expansion , in order to simulate the behavior of a quasi - condensate with thermal excitations .",
    "low energy phonons that expand in the hydrodynamic regime were also considered in @xcite as due to  quantum vacuum \" phase fluctuations . instead of investigating the effects of thermal and/or quantum fluctuations , we are here considering situations where the initial excitations are imprinted in a controllable way and characterized by looking at the shape of the expanded gas , thus allowing for a new type of spectroscopic studies of bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
