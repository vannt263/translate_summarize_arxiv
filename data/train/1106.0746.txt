    "a wealth of observations have shown that galaxy mergers are common and that nearly all galaxies host a central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "consequently , some galaxies must host two smbhs as the result of recent mergers .",
    "these are known as dual smbhs for the first @xmath4 myr after the merger when they are at separations @xmath5 kpc @xcite .",
    "dual - smbh systems are an important testing ground for theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "for example , simulations predict that quasar feedback in mergers can have extreme effects on star formation @xcite and that the core - cusp division in nuclear stellar distributions may be caused by the scouring effects of dual smbhs @xcite .",
    "a statistical study of dual smbhs and their host galaxies would thus have important implications for theories of galaxy formation and smbh growth .",
    "dual smbhs are observable when sufficient gas accretes onto them to power dual active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . while there have been identifications of hundreds of binary quasar pairs at separations @xmath6 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as a handful of galaxy pairs where each galaxy hosts an agn @xcite , very few agn pairs",
    "have been observed in the next evolutionary stage where they coexist at kpc - scale separations in the same merger - remnant galaxy . to date , the confirmed dual agn were identified by radio or x - ray resolution of two agn with separations of 7 kpc in the @xmath7 double radio source 3c 75 at the center of the galaxy cluster abell 400 @xcite , 4 kpc in the @xmath8 ultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk 463 @xcite , and 0.7 kpc in the @xmath7 ultraluminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240 @xcite .    in recent years",
    "dual agn candidates have been selected as galaxies with double - peaked agn emission lines , first in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite and later in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "although a double - peaked line profile is expected for dual agn , it could also be produced by gas kinematics in a single agn ; follow - up observations are necessary to distinguish between the two scenarios .",
    "follow - up optical longslit spectroscopy , near - infrared imaging , and adaptive optics imaging have added circumstantial evidence that many double - peaked systems may indeed be dual agn @xcite , but direct resolution of two separate agn is required for direct evidence of dual agn .     east of north ( top ) and position angle @xmath9 east of north ( middle ) and the sdss spectrum ( bottom ) for sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 . each spectrum is shifted to the rest frame of the host galaxy , and centered on the rest wavelength of @xmath1(dotted vertical line ) . in the lick / kast spectra , night - sky emission features have been subtracted and both vertical axes span @xmath10 ( 31.8 @xmath3 kpc at the @xmath0 redshift of the galaxy ) .",
    "the double peaks in @xmath1 in the sdss spectrum correspond to spatially - offset double emission features in the lick / kast spectra , suggesting the presence of dual agn with a line - of - sight velocity separation of 350 km s@xmath2 and a projected spatial separation of 1.9 @xmath3 kpc ( or 0@xmath1168 ) on the sky .",

    "the observation was reduced using the latest _",

    "software ( ciao4.3 ) and the most recent set of calibration files ( caldb4.4.1 ) .",
    "the data were reprocessed with the `` chandra_repro '' script using the subpixel event repositioning algorithm of @xcite .",
    "intervals of strong background flaring were searched for , but none were found .",
    "we made a sky image of the field of sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1at a resolution of 00492 per pixel with events in the 0.38.0 kev energy range , and we fit two - dimensional models to that image . all fits were performed in sherpa @xcite using modified @xcite statistics ( `` cstat '' in sherpa ) and the @xcite optimization method ( `` simplex '' in sherpa ) .",
    "a family of fits was performed , using a grid of parameter starting points to ensure a proper sampling of the multidimensional fit space .",
    "we fit a two - component source model with a fixed background ( based on a source - free region near sdssj171544.05 + 600835.7 ) .",
    "the source model was a @xmath21 profile , which is a two - dimensional lorentzian with a varying power law of the form @xmath22 and is a good match to the _ chandra _  psf .",
    "based on other work @xcite , the power law index @xmath23 was tied to the @xmath24 parameter , and both components were required to have the same @xmath24 .",

    "we therefore extracted a spectrum of both sources together and use the results of our two - dimensional image fits to assign appropriate fractions of the total flux to each component .",
    "we fit the unbinned spectrum in sherpa using cstat statistics and the simplex method .",
    "the spectral model was a simple absorbed power law with the column density constrained to be at least the galactic value of @xmath31 @xcite .",

    "the uncertainty was calculated using the `` sample_energy_flux '' tool in sherpa , which takes into account uncertainties in all model parameters .",
    "using the results of our two - dimensional image fit , the northern component has a best - fit flux of @xmath35 , and the southern component has @xmath36 .",
    "the 210  kev fluxes are @xmath37 for the northern component and @xmath38 for the southern component , which we compare to the 210  kev fluxes predicted from the @xmath1fluxes using the scaling relation for type 2 agn in @xcite .",
    "the predicted 210  kev fluxes are @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the redshifted and blueshifted components of , respectively .",
    "the measured 210  kev fluxes are hence a factor of several lower than but within the broad uncertainties of the predictions from @xcite .",
    "although we can not fit separate spectra for the two components , we can extract the counts in small regions centered on them and form hardness ratios , defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of counts in the 28 kev range and @xmath43 is the number of counts in the 0.52 kev range . counts were extracted from 025 radius regions centered on each source , yielding 20 counts from the northern source with @xmath44 and 10 counts from the southern source with @xmath45 .",
    "uncertainties on the hardness ratios were calculated using the bayesian estimation of hardness ratios package @xcite .",
    "judging from the measured hardness ratios , neither source is as hard as would be expected for moderately absorbed ( but not compton - thick ) agn , although the signal - to - noise ratio is very modest .     is reported from @xmath46-band adaptive optics imaging @xcite.,width=240 ]      if sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1has dual agn separated by 1.9 @xmath3 kpc that are the result of a galaxy merger , we might expect the two agn to be coincident with two stellar components that are the remnants of the progenitor galaxies in the merger .",
    "in fact , sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1was one of 50 sdss galaxies with double - peaked @xmath1lines that was targeted for keck ii laser guide - star adaptive - optics ( lgsao ) observations in @xcite , which found that 16 of these galaxies exhibited double stellar components with separations 0.6  12 @xmath3 kpc ( or 0.2  3@xmath47 ) , suggestive of merging systems . while @xcite do not show the image of sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 , they report that the keck / lgsao @xmath46-band image reveals only a single component with @xmath48 and classify the galaxy as  isolated \" .",
    "the psf fwhms for their observations were @xmath49 to @xmath50 , suggesting that sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1may have no substructure at @xmath51 visible in these @xmath46-band observations .",
    "based on its sdss photometry , sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1has a rest - frame @xmath52 color of 2.62 and an absolute @xmath53-band magnitude of -22.0 , placing it on the red sequence of sdss galaxies @xcite . the sdss image of the galaxy shows no signatures of galaxy interaction ( figure  [ fig : sdss ] ) .",
    "here we explore the physical mechanisms that could explain the observations of double agn emission components and x - ray sources in sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 .",
    "the sources high x - ray luminosities lead us to consider the possibility that they are ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , which are variable off - nuclear x - ray sources .",
    "some ulxs are also candidate intermediate mass black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , estimates of the black hole mass from the optical spectra place sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1 in the supermassive black hole regime ( fu et al . 2010 ) .",
    "further , the measured @xmath1fluxes and luminosities are well above those typically measured in ulxs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the galaxy hosts dual agn that are the result of a triple smbh interaction , where a gravitational slingshot effect @xcite ejected the least massive smbh ( corresponding to the southern agn ) while the remaining two smbhs merged ( producing the northern agn ) .",
    "the remaining stellar component associated with the southern agn could be too faint to appear in the keck / lgsao observations . however , the optical observations suggest that both agn have associated narrow - line regions and it is unclear how the ejected smbh would maintain its narrow - line region .",
    "we note also that if there is only a single source visible in the keck / lgsao image , a second stellar component could be either obscured or too faint to be within the detection threshold of the keck / lgsao observation . if there are two agn with associated stellar components , the stellar component accompanying the southern agn is more likely to be obscured since it is harder and consequently more absorbed than the northern agn . if the southern agn is obscured and the northern agn is not , the overall extinction for the system could be skewed towards the low value measured in   [ chandra ] .",
    "another explanation for our observations is that the galaxy hosts agn jets that produce both @xmath1and x - rays from a combination of photoionization from the agn and collisional ionization from the jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for this scenario to explain our observations , either the agn is completely obscured and only the jets are visible or one of the sources in our observations is the agn while the other is the foreground jet and the background jet is obscured .",
    "both scenarios rely on significant obscuration in part of the galaxy , but this could be consistent with the low column density we measured if the rest of the galaxy is relatively unobscured .",
    "however , the jet scenario typically produces a bright core and a much fainter jet , whereas our observations show two sources that differ by only a factor of 2 in 210  kev luminosities .",
    "the observations may also be explained by dual agn that are compton thick .",
    "the x - ray spectra alone  if confirmed  exclude compton - intermediate agn , where the absorption would correspond to a column of @xmath54 @xmath55 , as there the observed x - ray flux would be dominated by partially ( photoelectrically ) absorbed continuum that is detectable as a hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "instead the data suggest that both sources are either unabsorbed or the absorption is severe , essentially resulting in a compton - thick spectrum .",
    "the optical spectra seem to exclude classical , unabsorbed type 1 agn , so we are left with a compton - thick scenario , with @xmath56 of at least a few ( column @xmath57 @xmath55 ) . there , not only the primary nuclear soft x - ray flux is photoelectrically absorbed , but even the hard x - rays are suppressed by compton opacity , and we detect only primary soft x - rays scattered back to our line of sight , as is the case in , e.g. , ngc 1068 and other compton - thick agn .",
    "the measured 210  kev luminosities for the northern and southern components are within the range of values measured for compton - thick agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the compton - thick scenario is also consistent with the low column density of the galaxy , since the column density measurement presupposed that the source was not compton thick .",
    "we conclude that sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 most likely hosts compton - thick dual agn , because it is the scenario that is most consistent with the existing data .",
    "agn jets might also explain the observations , and deeper x - ray observations could distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "these more sensitive x - ray measurements would enable a test of the compton - thick scenario , since better spectral measurements in the soft x - ray band could provide a possible measurement of the fe k line , which is seen in heavily absorbed agn ( for a discussion , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sensitive hard x - ray measurements would provide much better constraints on the absorbing column .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ narrow - band imaging of the @xmath1emission could also show whether it has the biconical morphology expected for agn jets .",
    "we report observations of a double x - ray source with 1.9 @xmath3 kpc , or 0@xmath1168 , projected spatial separation in the @xmath0 candidate dual agn galaxy sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 . this seyfert 2 galaxy exhibits double - peaked @xmath1emission lines with 350 km s@xmath2 line - of - sight velocity separation in its sdss spectrum , and our follow - up lick / kast longslit spectra show two 1.9 @xmath3 kpc separation @xmath1emission components . while the velocity and spatial offsets provide circumstantial evidence for dual agn , these features could also be produced by gas kinematics from a single agn .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observations bolster the evidence for dual agn , by revealing two x - ray components suggestive of compton - thick agn with the same spatial separation and orientation as the two sources of optical @xmath1emission .    to date ,",
    "dual agn have typically been identified serendipitously because of the interesting characteristics of their host galaxies .",
    "these host galaxies include ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite , a double radio source at the center of a galaxy cluster @xcite , and a host galaxy with double bright nuclei and a tidal tail @xcite .",
    "sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1is unlike these systems because there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the galaxy , which is a seemingly ordinary red sequence galaxy without tidal features visible in sdss imaging or substructure reported in adaptive optics imaging .",
    "our observations suggest that dual agn may be more ubiquitous and not limited to only galaxies with extreme star formation or unusual morphologies .",
    "we have introduced a systematic , observational method for selecting promising dual agn candidates , which have until now have only been identified through serendipitous discoveries of individual systems .",
    "the method consists of three steps : 1 ) select dual agn candidates as objects whose spectra exhibit double - peaked agn emission lines in sdss or other spectroscopic surveys of galaxies ; 2 ) conduct follow - up longslit spectroscopy of the dual agn candidates ; 3 ) if the follow - up longslit spectra reveal an object has two spatially - distinct agn emission components , use follow - up x - ray or radio observations to identify whether the object is a dual agn .",
    "sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 @xmath1is the first object for which this technique has been demonstrated , and our observations show it most likely hosts dual agn ; deeper x - ray observations would provide the definitive evidence .",
