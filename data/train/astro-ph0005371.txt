    "the double quasar q0957 + 561 a , b was the first discovered multiple image gravitational lens , the first to have a measured time delay and to produce a gravitational lens determination of the hubble parameter , and the first system in which a microlensing effect was seen in the observational brightness record ( vanderriest et al .",
    "this was not unexpected since such microlensing effects had already been predicted by chang & refsdal ( 1979 ) , see also kayser et al .",

    "report , schild & smith ( 1991 ) noted evidence for fine structure in the microlensing light - curve . in this paper",
    "we do not concern ourselves with this reported fine structure , and focus instead on the long - term microlensing trends .    after a period of controversy about the correct time delay value , kundi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observed an unusually distinct event in the light curve of image a which repeated in image b 417 days later .",
    "this time delay was very close to the values obtained earlier by vanderriest et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , schild & smith ( 1991 ) and pelt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and has later been confirmed with high precision by other workers , see for instance pelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found a time delay of 416.3 days .",
    "a precise value of the time delay is necessary in order to subtract out the intrinsic quasar brightness fluctuations on all time scales , and to find the microlensing residual .",
    "the most accurate determination of microlensing variability in q0957 + 561 was reported by pelt et al .",
    "this variability is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( their fig . 9 ) .",
    "two principal features are seen in the 15 year microlensing light - curve : a rise of 0.25 mag during a period of about 5 years ( 1982 - 1986 ) with a maximum slope of 0.07 mag per year , and a quiet phase of about 8 years ( 1988 - 1996 ) with a variability less than 0.05 mag .",
    "the original data in pelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show a large scatter which has sometimes been suggested to evidence microlensing on time scales of 100 days and shorter ( schild 1996 ) but the existence of such low amplitude and rapid fluctuations is complicated by questions of the accuracy of the data ; we therefore restrict our analysis to the less controversial long - term microlensing . although gaps as long as 300 days are present in the long - term microlensing record , segments where the brightness record is more intensively sampled seem to show that amplitudes on sub - year timescales are less than 5% and they average away as shown convincingly in the pelt et al .",

    "this paper is concerned with understanding the two features in the light - curve mentioned above , from models of the gravitational lens and microlensing from stars or other compact objects presumed to lie within the lens galaxy g1 . for typical quasar",
    "accretion disc sizes it is possible that statistical effects from numerous stars projected in front of the quasar must be considered ; a statistical microlensing theory for such a case can be found in refsdal & stabell ( 1991 ( rs1 ) , 1993 ( rs2 ) and 1997 )",
    ".    from macro - lens modeling of q0957 + 561 one finds the lensing optical depth for the a and b image to be @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and with shear terms @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( lehar , private communication ; see also schmidt & wambsganss ( 1998 ) for similar estimates and a definition of the shear ) .",
    "our source model is circular with a gaussian distributed surface luminosity and `` radius '' @xmath4 .",
    "we shall treat three different mass models in our microlensing simulations : + case 1 : all the lensing mass is in identical compact micro - lenses with mass @xmath0 .",
    "+ case 2 : 10% of the lensing mass is in identical compact lenses with mass @xmath0 and 90% in an evenly distributed continuum .",
    "+ case 3 : 10% of the lensing mass is in compact lenses with @xmath15 and 90% in compact lenses with mass @xmath16 .",
    "our approach is to compare simulated microlensing light - curves with the observed microlensing variability . because the lens mass @xmath0 and the source radius @xmath4 both affect the amplitude and time scale of variability , we find some interesting constraints for these two parameters in the lens system q0957 + 561 .",
    "schmidt & wambsganss ( 1998 ) have examined the available parameter space based upon an observed quiet period of 160 days with a variability less than 0.05 mag .",
    "the results of our study are based on the microlensing variability during 15 years , including a long quiet phase as well as a significant event and naturally gives stronger constraints .",
    "we make use of the observed microlensing light - curve covering a time span @xmath17 years , see fig.1 .",
    "the curve is given by :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the magnitude of the b image shifted by the time delay @xmath20 days ( see pelt et al .",
    "two significant microlensing features are found : + 1 ) a `` quiet '' period with a variability @xmath21 less than @xmath22 mag lasting @xmath23 years .",
    "+ 2 ) a variation of @xmath24 mag during a time interval @xmath25 years , with a maximum slope of about 0.07 mag / year ( `` the event '' ) .    we shall treat these two features independently and investigate by means of simulations how lens and source parameters can be constrained .",
    "the results will be demonstrated in `` exclusion diagrams '' , see figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "since the optical depth is much larger for the b image than for a , the microlensing variability in the a image is likely to be much smaller than in the b image .",
    "we shall therefore in this paper neglect a possible microlensing variability in the a image and assume that the observed microlensing variability comes only from b. from test calculations we find that this approximation has a rather small influence on the constraints obtained ( see discussion ) .",
    "we shall first choose all mass to be in lenses with mass @xmath0 .",
    "this may not be very realistic , but it allows a relatively simple discussion with only two free parameters ( @xmath0 and source radius @xmath4 ) , and it gives us an understanding which is quite useful also for more complex mass distributions .",
    "we simulated light - curves for the b image with effective transverse motion of the source parallel to the shear and perpendicular to the shear @xmath26 .",
    "the results for these two cases are always sufficiently similar so that an intermediate case easily can be interpolated . for practical reasons we shall instead of @xmath4 use the normalized source radius @xmath27 as a free parameter ,",
    "where @xmath28 is the einstein radius ( for mass @xmath0 ) , projected into the source plane    @xmath29    here the d s are angular size distances and @xmath30 is the dimension - less hubble parameter , @xmath31 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath32 . we have used a cosmological model with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    for randomly distributed compact lenses we simulate light - curves for different values of the normalized source radius @xmath1 , using well known ray tracing techniques , see krs and schneider & weiss ( 1987 ) .",
    "we obtain for each value chosen for @xmath1 the magnitude of the source as a function of the normalized source position : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the length coordinate along the source track . for each value of @xmath1",
    "we get the light - curve for different ( but still all identical ) @xmath0-values by a transformation of @xmath38 to the time @xmath39 measured by the observer . for our system",
    "we find    @xmath40    here @xmath41 km s@xmath32 where @xmath9 is the effective transverse velocity of the source assumed to be constant , with time measured by the observer , see krs . when not stated otherwise we shall use @xmath42 and @xmath43 in this paper .    since @xmath44 the light - curves",
    "are simply stretched out in time for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , it is not necessary to calculate light - curves for different @xmath0-values ( for a given @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have therefore simulated light - curves only for various @xmath1-values ( @xmath1=0.02 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 ) .",
    "the length of the light - curves corresponds in most cases to at least 1000 years for the allowed masses , see eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "we first discuss the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath4 ( and @xmath1 ) which can be obtained from the quiet phase of 8 years .",
    "\\i ) quiet phase constraints    for each value of the normalized source radius @xmath1 we calculate the microlensing light - curve @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 . giving equal weight to the two shear directions we can then determine the probability @xmath48 to obtain a quiet period lasting at least 8 years during a period of 15 years with a variability @xmath49 less than @xmath22 mag . since @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath50 , the probability @xmath48 obviously increases monotonically with @xmath0 .",
    "hence , we can determine a critical mass @xmath51 by requiring that @xmath52 is , say 0.01 .",
    "we then choose to exclude values of @xmath53 less than @xmath54 since the probability of getting a quiet period of 8 years or more is then less than one percent ( compare the paper by schmidt & wambsganss , 1998 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath1 for @xmath56 is shown in the exclusion diagram in fig .",
    "2 as the solid line to the left labeled * q*.    we can roughly distinguish 3 different parts of the curve @xmath57 :    \\1 ) @xmath58 : here we find @xmath55 very nearly constant and equal to about @xmath59 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath60 cm and @xmath61 years .",
    "the behavior with an almost constant @xmath55 ( and @xmath28 and @xmath62 ) for small values of @xmath1 is a consequence of the nearly identical light - curves for different ( small ) @xmath1 with the same star field . only during caustic crossings",
    "will there be a major difference in the light - curves , but then the variability will be large anyway and therefore violate the quiet phase condition . for small @xmath1",
    "the probability of getting a quiet phase therefore only depends on @xmath0 so that @xmath55 is nearly independent of @xmath1 for @xmath63 .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath64 : here we find that @xmath65 is roughly proportional to @xmath66 . since @xmath67 this means that @xmath4 is roughly constant in this range .",
    "we find here @xmath68 cm and @xmath69 years .",
    "this result is not unexpected , since the variability time scale for sources with @xmath70 is about equal to @xmath71 , see rs2 .",
    "\\3 ) for @xmath72 the curve gets flatter and approaches asymptotically a maximum value of @xmath73 .",
    "such an asymptotic behavior was to be expected from the results in rs1 , where it was shown that microlensing amplitudes for large sources ( @xmath74 ) are proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "\\ii ) event constraints    in the simulated light - curves we consider only events with a variability between @xmath76 mag and @xmath77 mag ( @xmath78 ) , and with a maximum slope during the event steeper than 0.07 mag per year .",
    "the reason for choosing also an upper limit for the allowed event magnitudes is that the simulated events for small values of @xmath1 typically show larger amplitudes than the observed one . in our analysis",
    "we have found it more practical to use the maximum slope rather than the time scale @xmath79 .",
    "we can then estimate the probability @xmath80 of getting such an event during a time span of @xmath17 years .",
    "since the slope scales as @xmath81 and the simulated time span as @xmath82 , it is clear that @xmath83 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we can therefore determine a critical mass @xmath84 by requiring that @xmath85 is , say @xmath86 .",
    "we then choose to exclude values of @xmath53 larger than @xmath87 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath1 for @xmath89 is shown in fig .",
    "2 as the solid line to the right labeled * e*. it is seen that @xmath84 is roughly proportional to @xmath66 , and therefore @xmath4 is fairly constant over a large range of @xmath1-values ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we get here @xmath91 cm and @xmath92 years .",
    "this is easy to understand since a typical event time scale is the crossing time @xmath93 for large sources ( see rs2 ) as well as for small sources ( caustic crossings ) .    for small @xmath1-values",
    "we see that the @xmath88-curve departs from @xmath94 constant towards smaller values of @xmath4 , approaching a constant @xmath88-value of about 5@xmath95 for very small @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that for such small @xmath1-values , caustic crossing events as small as @xmath96 are quite rare . of some importance here",
    "are , however , some non - caustic events , typically occurring when the track passes just outside a cusp of a caustic . for very small",
    "sources(@xmath97 ) these events are nearly independent of @xmath1 , which can explain that @xmath84 stays nearly constant for these small @xmath1-values .",
    "we note that the time scale for these events are usually longer than the crossing time @xmath93 , see also wyithe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    for very small @xmath1-values the effect of the so - called ghost caustics which are produced",
    "when two lens masses are very close to each other is also of importance , ( grieger et al .",
    "1989 , wambsganss & kundi 1995 ) .",
    "these weak caustics can often `` produce '' events during caustic crossings as small as about 0.25 mag , even for very small @xmath1-values .",
    "an uncertainty arises , however , because relative motion of the stars some times causes large velocities of the ghost caustics so that the `` ghost events '' will occur more often and on a shorter time scale . since we have not considered relative motion in our calculations , we may have underestimated the frequency and overestimated the time scale of ghost events . in that case",
    "the upper limit for @xmath88 has been underestimated .    for large @xmath1-values",
    "the @xmath88-curve also departs from @xmath94 constant towards smaller values of @xmath4 and approaches asymptotically a maximum @xmath1-value of about @xmath98 .",
    "this high value of @xmath99 were to be expected from the results in rs2 , where it was shown that quite significant events can be produced for rather large values of @xmath1 .",
    "\\iii ) the allowed region    from the discussion in section i ) we found that the quiet phase constraint gives a lower limit , @xmath51 for the lens mass . in section",
    "ii ) on the other hand , the event constraint gave an upper limit @xmath84 .",
    "hence , at a significance level of @xmath100 we are left with an allowed region between the @xmath88 and @xmath55-curves in the @xmath101-plane which fulfills    @xmath102    for @xmath103 the allowed region is shown hatched in fig .",
    "2 . for @xmath1 between 0.5 and 20",
    "we find a strip within a relatively narrow range of @xmath4-values ( @xmath104 @xmath105 cm ) , covering @xmath0-values between @xmath2 and @xmath106 .",
    "for @xmath63 , mass values between @xmath107 and @xmath108 are usually allowed .",
    "for the smallest @xmath1-values the upper limit reaches about 5@xmath95",
    ". we can not give a reliable lower limit of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the lack of any clear high magnification events in all observed quasar light - curves is an argument against too small @xmath1-values ( and @xmath4-values ) for qsos in general .    for larger @xmath100-values the allowed region obviously decreases .",
    "as an example the allowed region for @xmath109 is shown more densely hatched in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that eq .",
    "( 4 ) can now only be fulfilled for @xmath110 and the possible mass shrinks approximately to the interval between 0.05 @xmath95 and 0.5 @xmath95 ( significance level of 10% , and all mass in identical lenses ) .",
    "since a large fraction of the lens mass may be in a smoothly distributed continuum , we have repeated most of the calculations in the previous section , but now with 90% of the mass in a continuum and the remaining 10% in compact lenses with mass @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting constraint curves are shown as solid lines in fig . 3 for a significance level of 0.01 , and the allowed region is hatched .",
    "we find that the asymptotic maximum @xmath1-values @xmath111 and @xmath99 decrease with a factor of about 3 relative to case 1 .",
    "this was to be expected because the variability amplitude for large @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath112 , so that @xmath111 and @xmath99 should be proportional to @xmath113 , see rs1 . here",
    "@xmath114 is the optical depth for microlensing which is now a factor of 10 smaller than in case 1 .",
    "the possible mass range is now restricted to an interval between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "for @xmath109 the allowed region is shown more densely hatched .",
    "we see that the possible mass now only covers an interval between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and @xmath1 is restricted to be less than about 2 .",
    "from the observed light and spectrum of the lensing galaxy we know that some of the mass must be in stars with typically one solar mass .",
    "we have therefore investigated a model with two lens populations ; 10% of the mass in solar mass stars and the rest of the mass in objects of smaller mass , @xmath0 . treating as before @xmath0 and @xmath119 as free parameters we get mostly small changes ( relative to case 1 ) in the constraint curves in the ( @xmath120)-plane . the @xmath55-curves are almost unchanged , since the few @xmath108 stars can only make a minor change in the probability of getting long quiet phases for @xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath88-curves also follow very closely the corresponding curves for case 1 ( with all mass in identical stars ) .",
    "a separate discussion of this case is therefore not necessary .",
    "we have until now assumed specific values of the effective transverse velocity @xmath9 and the hubble parameter @xmath122 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is easy to see what happens if these values are changed .",
    "if for example the transverse velocity is increased by a factor @xmath123 , an identical light - curve is obtained if the source size @xmath4 and the einstein radius @xmath28 are increased by the same factor , such that @xmath27 is unchanged .",
    "increasing the einstein radius by a factor f means that each lens mass is increased by a factor @xmath124 , and to keep the optical depth for lensing unchanged , the linear size of the lens field must of course be scaled up with a factor @xmath123 .",
    "correspondingly , an increase of the hubble parameter with a factor @xmath123 can be compensated by an increase of each lens mass with the same factor to keep the light - curve unchanged .",
    "since the einstein radius is unchanged in this case , the optical depth is also unchanged , and no change in the size of the lens field is necessary .    according to the above discussion , the allowed regions in figs . 2 and 3 will be shifted in mass when @xmath9 and @xmath122 are changed .",
    "@xmath125    @xmath126    this is most conveniently taken into account by just scaling the mass coordinate appropriately , thereby leaving the curves in figs . 2 and 3 in the same positions .",
    "obviously the dominating uncertainty in @xmath0 comes from the @xmath127 term .",
    "by means of the two features in the microlensing light - curve for the q0957 + 561 system and numerical simulations , we have shown that it is possible to set constraints on some parameters for the lens system . with the amount of the continuum mass between 0% ( case 1 ) and 90% ( case 2 )",
    "we find the possible lens masses to have values between @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( 1% level ) and between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( 10% level ) .",
    "the maximum source radius is found to be @xmath5 cm ( 1% level ) and @xmath8 cm ( 10% level ) . by including case 3 ( giving approximately the same reults as case 1 ) , we find only negligible changes in the above limits .    from the two features in the microlensing light - curve",
    "it seems not possible to give a lower limit of @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for this is that the light - curves for very small ( but different ) values of @xmath1 are very similar , except during caustic crossings , and then the quiet phase constraint is violated anyhow .    from lens arguments based on the q0957 + 561 light - curve alone , we can therefore not rule out very small @xmath1-values ( even those much smaller than 0.02 ) , and hence very small @xmath4-values .",
    "however , the lack of any clear high magnification events in observed quasar light - curves is an argument against too small @xmath1-values ( and @xmath4-values ) for qsos in general .",
    "we have in this paper only considered microlensing effects in the b image .",
    "the combined a and b microlensing light - curve will statistically show slightly more variability and less chance of extended quiet phases , and have a slightly higher rate of events than for b alone .",
    "hence , both @xmath55 and @xmath88 will increase slightly .",
    "our test calculations indicate a rather small effect of about 10% .",
    "since we have neglected the relative motion of the lens masses we may have underestimated the maximum allowed lens mass which occur for small values of @xmath1 , particularly in case 1 .",
    "this ought to be investigated in the future .",
    "we have in this investigation considered the two features found in the light - curve for q0957 + 561 independently and used the probabilities @xmath130 and @xmath131 separately .",
    "an alternative approach , which would have given much stronger constraints , might have been to consider the probability for both features to be found within a period of 15 years which must be less than @xmath132 .",
    "the largest values of @xmath132 ( between 0.01 and @xmath133 are obviously found within the densely hatched regions in fig . 2 ( case 1 ) and fig .",
    "3 ( case 2 ) .",
    "the most probable mass values would then mainly depend on the amount of mass in the continuum ( @xmath134 in case 1 and @xmath135 in case 2 ) , and the most probable @xmath1-value is less than 1 .",
    "it is , however , not possible to give levels of significance here since we are obviously doing a posteriori statistics .",
    "it seems in fact difficult to avoid a posteriori statistics when making use of a larger part of the information in the light - curve .",
    "wyithe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have published a series of papers ( see astro - ph/9911245 and references therein ) where they make use of the distribution of the microlensed light - curve derivatives , and they apply the method on the qso 2237 + 0305 light - curve . their method does not suffer from a posteriori statistics , but more information in the light - curve could perhaps have been taken into account , for instance the correlation time - scale for the derivatives , without running this risk .",
    "a comparison with their results is , however , difficult since they are considering a different system . for their system",
    "the value of @xmath28 is about a factor of 3 larger , whereas the source radius @xmath4 is roughly a factor 2.5 smaller ( estimated from the difference in intrinsic luminosity ) .",
    "hence , the normalized source radius @xmath27 will be a factor of about 7 smaller",
    ". with this factor in mind we do not see any serious conflict between the rather small @xmath4-values they obtain and our ( most probable ) values .",
