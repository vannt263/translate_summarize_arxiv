    "the land g - factor or gyromagnetic factor @xmath2 is described by the formula between particle s magnetic moment @xmath3 and it s spin @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bohr magneton . in the dirac equation , the value of @xmath2 is @xmath7 for a point - like particle .",
    "deviation from this value @xmath8 is called as the anomalous magnetic moment , and without anomalous and radiative corrections @xmath9 .",
    "however , the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath10 of the electron was firstly obtained using radiative corrections by schwinger as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "so far , the accuracy of the @xmath10 was examined by many theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "these studies have provided the most precise determination of fine - structure constant @xmath12 , since @xmath10 is quite senseless to the strong and weak interactions . on the other hand",
    ", the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath13 of the muon enables testing the standart model ( sm ) and investigating alternative theories to the sm .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath13 can be obtained with high sensitivity through spin precession experiment .",
    "otherwise , the spin precession experiment can not be used to measure the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath14 of the tau , because of the relatively short lifetime @xmath15 s of tau @xcite .",
    "so the current bounds of the @xmath14 are obtained by collision experiments .",
    "the theoretical value of the @xmath14 from qed is given as @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the experimental bounds on the the @xmath14 are provided by the l3 : @xmath17 , opal : @xmath18 and delphi : @xmath19 collaborations at the lep at @xmath1 c.l . @xcite .",
    "cp violation was firstly observed in a small fractions of @xmath20 mesons decaying to two pions in the sm @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology in the sm can be easily introduced by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mechanism in the quark sector @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is no cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "however , cp violation in the quark sector causes a very small electric dipole moment of the leptons . at least to three - loop",
    "are required in order to produce a nonzero contributing in the sm and it s crude estimate is obtained as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "if at least two of the three neutrinos have different mass values , cp violation in the lepton sector can occur as similar to the cp violation in the quark sector @xcite .",
    "there are many different models beyond the sm inducing to cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "these models are leptoquark @xcite , susy @xcite , left - right symmetric @xcite and more higgs multiplets @xcite .    the bounds at @xmath1 c. l. on the anomalous electric dipole moment of the tau yield by lep experiments l3 : @xmath22 , opal : @xmath23 , and delphi : @xmath23 .",
    "the most restrictive experimental bounds are obtained by belle : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "there are model dependent and independent studies on the anomalous dipole moments of the tau lepton in the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider that difference between @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) can be reduced to determine precisely a new term proportional to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) to the sm @xmath32 vertex .",
    "for this reason , the electromagnetic vertex factor of the tau lepton can be parameterized    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the momentum transfer to the photon and @xmath36 gev is the mass of tau lepton .",
    "in the sm , at tree level , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . besides , in the loop effects arising from the sm and the new physics , @xmath30 and @xmath31 may be not equal to zero .",
    "for example , the anomalous coupling @xmath30 is given by    @xmath40    where @xmath26 is the contribution of the sm and @xmath41 is the contribution of the new physics @xcite.therefore , the @xmath42-dependent form factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 in limit @xmath45 are given by ,    @xmath46    the compact linear collider ( clic ) is a proposed future @xmath47 collider , designed to fulfill @xmath47 collisions at energies from @xmath48 to @xmath49 tev @xcite , and it is planned to be constructed with a three main stages research region @xcite .",
    "the clic has been extensively studied for interactions beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the clic enables to investigate the @xmath50 and @xmath51 interactions by converting the original @xmath52 or @xmath53 beam into a photon beam through the laser backscattering procedure @xcite .",
    "one of the other well - known applications of the clic is the @xmath54 process , where the emitted quasireal photon @xmath55 is scattered with small angle from the beam pipe of @xmath52 or @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "since these photons have a low virtuality ( @xmath56gev@xmath57 ) , they are almost on mass shell .",
    "@xmath54 processes can be described by equivalent photon approximation , i.e. using the weizsacker - williams approximation @xcite .",
    "such processes have experimentally observed at the lep , tevatron and lhc @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons why we have chosen the clic in this work : first , the observation of the most stringent experimental bound on the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the tau lepton by using multiperipheral collision at the lep through the process @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "secondly , the importace of high center - of - mass energies to examine the electromagnetic properties of tau lepton since anomalous @xmath32 couplings depend on more energy than sm @xmath32 couplings at the tree level .",
    "therefore , we investigate the potential of clic via the process @xmath58 to examine the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of tau lepton .",
    "during calculations , the comphep-@xmath59 program was used by including the new interaction vertices @xcite .",
    "also , the acceptance cuts were imposed as @xmath60 for pseudorapidity , @xmath61 gev for transverse momentum cut of the final state particles , @xmath62 the separation of final tau leptons .",
    "we show the integrated total cross - section of the process @xmath0 as a function of the anomalous couplings @xmath30 and @xmath31 in fig .",
    "@xmath63 for three different center - of - mass energies . as can be seen in fig .",
    "@xmath63 , while the total cross section is symmetric for anomalous coupling @xmath31 , it is nonsymmetric for @xmath30 .",
    "we estimate @xmath1 c. l. bounds on anomalous coupling parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 using @xmath64 test .",
    "the @xmath64 function is described by the following formula    @xmath65    where @xmath66 ; @xmath67 is the statistical error and @xmath68 is the systematic error .",
    "the number of expected events is calculated as the signal @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "the tau lepton decays roughly @xmath71 of the time leptonically and @xmath72 of the time to one or more hadrons .",
    "so we consider one of the tau leptons decays leptonically and the other hadronically for the signal .",
    "thereby , we assume that branching ratio of the tau pairs in the final state to be @xmath73 .",
    "there are systematic uncertainties in exclusive production at the lepton and hadron colliders . for the process",
    "@xmath74 , systematic errors are experimentally studied between @xmath75 and @xmath76 at the lep @xcite .",
    "recently , exclusive lepton production at the lhc has been examined and its systematic uncertainty is @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "also , the process @xmath78 with @xmath79 of the total systematic error at the lhc has investigated phenomenologically in ref . [ 19 ] .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity limits on the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the tau lepton through the process @xmath74 have calculated by considering three systematic errors : @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on the other hand , there may occur an uncertainty arising from virtuality of @xmath55 used in the weizsacker - williams approximation . in figs .",
    "@xmath7-@xmath82 , we have calculated the integrated cross sections as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for different @xmath83 values .",
    "we can see from these figures the total cross section changes slightly with the variation of the @xmath83 value .",
    "the sensitivity limits on the anomalous couplings @xmath14 and @xmath84 for different values of photon virtuality , center - of - mass energy and luminosity has been given in table i. it has shown that the bounds on the anomalous couplings do not virtually change when @xmath83 increases .",
    "therefore , we can understand that the large values of @xmath83 do not bring an important contribution to obtain sensitivity limits on the anomalous couplings @xcite .    in tables",
    "ii - iv , we show 95% c.l .",
    "sensitivity bounds of the coupling @xmath14 and @xmath85 for various systematic uncertainties , integrated clic luminosities and center of mass energies .",
    "while calculating the table values , we assumed that at a given time , only one of the anomalous couplings deviated from the sm . in fig .",
    "@xmath86 , we demonstrate the sensitivity contour plot at @xmath1 c.l . for the anomalous couplings @xmath30 and @xmath31 at the @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath49 tev with corresponding maximum luminosities through process @xmath0 .",
    "the clic as a @xmath89 collider using the weizsacker - williams virtual photon fields of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 provides an ideal venue to investigate the electromagnetic moments of the tau lepton . for this reason",
    ", we have studied the potential of @xmath0 at the clic to examine the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the tau lepton .",
    "the findings of this study show that the clic can improve the sensitivity bounds on anomalous couplings electromagnetic dipole moments of tau lepton with respect to the lep bounds .",
