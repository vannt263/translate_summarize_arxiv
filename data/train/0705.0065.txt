    "of these sources , nearly all are associated with supernova products : four with bright pulsar wind nebula ( pwne  three of which contain detected young , energetic pulsars ) , and two with non - thermal shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) ; the remaining object is associated with a high - mass x - ray binary system .",
    "there are five less secure associations with snrs / pwne ( _ hess _  `` b / c '' class sources ) . the remaining nine _ hess _",
    "sources have yet to be identified with a known object at any other wavelength .    an opportunity to study the origin of snr tev emission",
    "is provided by the coincidence of the unidentified tev source  with a previously uncatalogued shell - type radio supernova remnant g12.82@xmath00.02  ( brogan et al . 2005 ; ubertini et al . 2005 ; helfand et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this low - surface - brightness , small - diameter ( @xmath10 ) remnant lies within the @xmath11 extent of  and is coincident with a bright _ asca _  x - ray source .",
    "the possibility that this source represented a third example of a shell - type snr producing non - thermal x - rays along with tev gamma rays raised considerable interest ; however , as noted by the above authors , the source of the high - energy emission could also be an energetic pulsar associated with this apparently young remnant .",
    "helfand  ( 2005 ) noted the proximity of the star forming region w33 as a source of ambient photons for producing gamma - rays from inverse compton scattering .",
    "we report here on a _ chandra _  high - resolution image of g12.82@xmath00.02 .",
    "the x - ray flux from the remnant is resolved into diffuse non - thermal emission that fills the interior of the radio snr , and surrounds a bright non - thermal point source . in ",
    "2 we describe the _ chandra _  observation of g12.82@xmath00.02 , as well as supporting data we have collected in other wavelength regimes . in  3 , we discuss our interpretation of this system as a young , energetic rotation - powered pulsar associated with the radio remnant and powering a pulsar wind nebula178 that reaches similar conclusions . ] .",
    "we also consider the origin of tev emission from this and other hess sources , suggesting that the presence or absence of a high - intensity , local source of optical / ir photons may often be determinative in the production of a tev source . in the following text",
    "we assume a distance to g12.82@xmath00.02  of 4.5  kpc , as discussed in  3.1 .",
    "a 30  ks x - ray observation of snr g12.82@xmath00.02  was obtained on 2006 september 15 ut using the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory .",
    "data were collected with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) in the focal plane , operating in the nominal full - frame timed / vfaint exposure mode .",
    "this detector is sensitive to x - rays in the 0.312.0  kev energy range with a resolution of @xmath12 fwhm at 1  kev .",
    "the imaging system offers an on - axis spatial resolution of @xmath13 , which is also the instrument pixel size .",
    "the _ asca _  source associated with g12.82@xmath00.02  was positioned on the acis - i3 front - illuminated ccd and offset by @xmath14 from the nominal aimpoint to allow any extended x - ray emission from the source to fall wholly on this one ccd .",
    "a total of 29.6  ks of live - time was accumulated with a ccd frame time of 3.241  s ( given the 1.3% readout deadtime ) .",
    "no time filtering was necessary as the background rate was stable over the course of the observation . with a maximum count rate in a pixel of @xmath15  s@xmath4 , photon pile - up can be safely ignored .",
    "we used the standard processed and filtered event data , with the exception that the level  2 event file was reprocessed to remove the pixel randomization , restoring a slightly sharper image . all data reduction and analysis",
    "was performed using the ciao ( v3.3.0 ) , ftools ( v6.0.4 ) , caldb 3.2.3 , and xspec ( v12.2.1 ) x - ray analysis software packages .",

    "this portion of the image contains 23 other source significant at the @xmath18 level ( see table  1 ) , and represents @xmath19 of the full acis - i field - of - view . ]        as shown in figures  1  and  2 , the _ chandra _  image of g12.82@xmath00.02  resolves the _ asca _  source into diffuse x - ray emission that mostly fills the radio shell and peaks toward a bright unresolved point source , the brightest within the full @xmath20 acis - i 4-ccd field - of - view .",
    "this point source is offset from the geometric center of the radio remnant by @xmath21 .",
    "near this source is a localized , oval - shaped structure extending to the west / southwest ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "it is clear from a radial profile centered on the point emission ( figure  3 ) that this excess emission is prominent out to @xmath22 and disappears into the background at about @xmath23 .",
    "the radial profile is otherwise consistent with that of a point source when the large - scale diffuse emission filling the radio shell is taken into account .",
    "the overall morphology is highly reminiscent of a young , energetic pulsar within a structured pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the highest radio surface brightness region of the shell lies along its western boundary , suggesting it has encountered a higher ambient density in this direction .",
    "taking the possibility of asymmetric expansion into account , the location of the x - ray point source is consistent with the location of the supernova explosion .",
    "the offset of the point source from the center of the shell represents a distance of only @xmath24  pc at the adopted distance of 4.5  kpc ( see  3.1 ) , implying @xmath25 km s@xmath4 if the remnant is @xmath26  yr old .",

    "the gamma - ray luminosity of  at energies above 200 gev is @xmath188  ergs s@xmath4 , nearly identical to its @xmath2  kev x - ray luminosity .",

    "upper limits to the tev flux from two other prominent young pwne in the composite remnants snr  g11.20.3 and snr  g29.70.3 ( kes  75 ) can be derived from the hess galactic plane survey ( aharonian  2006 ) ; they also imply @xmath190 . as funk  ( 2006 )",
    "show , the tev emission from g12.82@xmath00.02  can be fitted simultaneously to the hard x - ray data from integral ( ubertini  2005 ) and the @xmath191 kev x - ray spectrum with an inverse - compton model , although a low - energy break in the electron spectrum is required to explain the absence of a radio counterpart to the pwn .",
    "we regard the proximity of w33 as a likely explanation for the relatively high tev flux from g12.82@xmath00.02 .",
    "we find it noteworthy that a number of hess sources are found where high - energy particle accelerators are located near regions , while other such accelerators without proximate sources of low - energy photons are weak or undetected at tev energies .",
    "for example , the crab nebula has the lowest @xmath189 for a pwn observed to date and lies more than @xmath192 from the galactic plane ; likewise , kes  75 , an isolated snr housing a very young and energetic pulsar but with no nearby regions , has @xmath193 and is undetected by hess . on the other hand , snr  g0.9@xmath00.1 near the galactic center , psr 1509@xmath058 near the region g320.5@xmath01.4 , and g12.82@xmath00.02  near w33 are all easily detected .",
    "in addition , hess  j1640@xmath0465 is a new pwn candidate associated with the shell - type snr g338.3@xmath00.02 and is adjacent to a bright region ( funk  2007 ) .",
    "those authors quote a @xmath194 distance for this remnant of 8  kpc , and therefore suggest that it is unassociated with the region , whose kinematic distance places it at 3  kpc . however",
    ", the @xmath194 relation is notoriously unreliable ( green 2005 ) and the 8  kpc distance would imply that hess j1640@xmath0465 is considerably more luminous than the crab nebula , whereas a 3  kpc distance would imply @xmath195  ergs s@xmath4 , similar to the other pwn detected to date .",
    "in addition , the source hess  j1834@xmath0087 , coincident with the shell - type snr  g23.3@xmath00.3 , also lies within @xmath196 of a bright region , while the historical remnant sn1006 , the first snr from which hard x - ray synchrotron flux was detected , has not been seen at tev energies despite an intensive search ( aharonian  2005 ) ; it lies over @xmath197 from the galactic plane .",
    "this accumulating anecdotal evidence suggests that a systematic evaluation of the local optical / ir flux in the vicinity of known particle accelerators might point the way to detecting more tev sources .",
    "_ glast _ will be invaluable for distinguishing between leptonic and hadronic tev emissions mechanisms ( e.g. , funk 2007 ) ; the evidence adduced here suggests the inverse compton mechanism may be preferred for the majority of hess detections .",
