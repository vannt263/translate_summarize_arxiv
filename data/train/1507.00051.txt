    "ngc 6888 is an emission nebula associated with the wolf - rayet star wr 136 with spectral type wn6(h ) , and it is a typical example of a ring nebula resulting from the continuous interaction between a strong stellar wind and the interstellar medium .",
    "projected on the sky , this nebula seems to be a filamentary and clumpy gaseous ellipse emitting mainly in h@xmath4 and optical [ n ii ] lines , with an axis - size of @xmath5 arcmin @xcite , and it is surrounded by a homogeneous sphere which emits mainly in [ o iii ] 5007   @xcite .",
    "the combination of its filamentary morphology and its nitrogen enhanced abundance suggests that the ejections , coming from a previous evolutionary stage of the star wr 136 , have contributed in an important way to the formation of the ring nebula that we see today @xcite .",
    "both the nebula ngc 6888 and its central star wr 136 have been already studied in several wavelength ranges from x - rays to radio emission .",
    "for example , the stellar parameters , such as the stellar temperature , mass - loss rate and terminal velocity , have been calculated by @xcite and @xcite by using stellar atmosphere codes and comparing the results with observed ultraviolet , optical and infrared stellar spectra ; while the wind velocity law and clumpiness were studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that wr 136 emits in x - ray energies .",
    "in particular , these authors found soft emission ( @xmath6 kev ) coming from outside the wind and hard emission ( @xmath7 kev ) coming from the gas inside the wind .",
    "the complete hot bubble in the interior of ngc 6888 was observed with the _ space telescope suzaku _ @xcite , confirming the existence of nitrogen enriched x - ray emitting plasma which consists of two thermal components , one emiting soft x - rays and the other one , hard x - rays .",
    "based on this , the authors proposed a new x - ray emission mechanism based on the thermal interaction between heavy particles , given that the known mechanisms are not capable to explain simultaneously these two x - ray emitting components .",
    "however , as these authors explain , it is necessary to have better observational restrictions to confirm this idea .",
    "on the other hand , complete hydrodynamical simulations performed by @xcite , attempting to reproduce the x - ray observations , indicate that the nebular morphology plays a key role in the presence of x - rays in ring nebulae .",
    "these authors conclude that the x - ray emission is higher in bubbles with shell - like morphology than the one present in clumpy filamentary bubbles . however , as the authors indicate , the stellar evolutionary models are not able to reproduce simultaneously the observed stellar parameters and the spectral signatures of the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the physical properties in different zones of ngc 6888 , such as electronic temperature and density , expansion velocity and chemical composition , have been investigated by several authors since @xcite to recently @xcite .",
    "ev92 made a chemodynamical study and they found that ngc 6888 has a chemical composition revealing the material processed in the interior of a star with an initial mass between 25 m@xmath8 and 40 m@xmath8 .",
    "these results were confirmed by m - d14 who detected for the first time the c ii 4267   recombination line , allowing to estimate the c abundance . in this way they presented a complete study of the trace of cno cycle in the nebula .",
    "fm12 made a very complete study of ngc 6888 through integral field spectroscopy observations performing 1d and 2d analyses .",
    "their results show indeed that ngc 6888 has a complex structure with shells and filaments moving with different velocities .",
    "in particular they proposed an  onion - like \" morphology composed mainly by three shells . concerning the plasma properties ,",
    "they found that the electron density ranges from less than 100 to 360 @xmath9 and the electron temperature presents variations from @xmath107 700 to @xmath1010 200 k. in addition , they reported important variations in the nitrogen abundance across the nebula , the n / o ratio being much higher in the inner region .",
    "recently @xcite derived n / o values from the infrared [ n iii ] 57-@xmath11 m and [ o iii]-88 @xmath11 m lines and their results would indicate that the edge region of ngc 6888 , over the major axis , has lower n abundance with respect to the inner region near the star .",
    "all the previous works focus only on the modelling of the star or the nebula but not both simultaneously .",
    "further , when a single study of these systems is made ( star or nebula ) it is difficult to assign a value to the physical parameters only based on generic data .",
    "this is why we focus in a semiempirical method based in the self - consistent modelling of the star and its associated nebula .",
    "it is logical to proceed in this way because the nebula associated to the star is naturally an additional restriction to the stellar atmosphere model , because the nebula can tell us about the ionizing ultraviolet photons coming from the star and then reprocessed and reemitted with low energy through recombination and collisional processes .",
    "in this way we can realize how well a stellar model can produce the ionization stage of the nebula and for this purpose we build a photoionization model of ngc 6888 based on spectroscopic observations where the modelled stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is used as the ionization source .",
    "this methodology will give us the advantage to obtain more constrained and coherent physical values for all the components of the entire system than those resulting from a single study of each component as it was made until now .",
    "the results from this work will help to better constraint other kind of studies as models of stellar evolution , astrophysical bubble formation and , in particular , the presence of x - rays in the bubbles since this hot gaseous component imposes an additional and important restriction to understand the whole system , given that is there where the stellar wind energy is stored .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , observations and data reduction process are described .",
    "3 contains the information of the line flux measurements and the error estimates . in sect .",
    "4 we describe the stellar and nebular models as well as our methodology to constraint the free parameters .",
    "a discussion about our best self - consistent model is presented in sect .",
    "5 . finally , in sect . 6 , we present our conclusions .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the comparison between the model predictions and the observed dereddened line fluxes is presented in table  [ tab : res1 ] and table  [ tab : res2 ] corresponding to the photionization model results by using _ star1 _ and _ star3 _ sed s as ionizing source , respectively .",
    "parameter , in these tables , shows the goodness of our model and is defined following @xcite as : + @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the value returned by the model , @xmath14 is the observed flux and @xmath15 is the accepted tolerance in dex of this observable .",
    "we define the tolerance to be + @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the measured error .",
    "when a line flux is well reproduced the _",
    "value is between @xmath181.0 and 1.0 .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : res1 ] show that , under the assumptions made for this model and using _",
    "star1 _ as ionizing source , the observed line fluxes are not well reproduced .",
    "in particular the lines from highly ionized elements ( o@xmath19 , ar@xmath19 ) are extremely overpredicted .",
    "the best case is for the values in position a where only half of the whole line fluxes ( the low excitation ones ) detected in this region are well reproduced .",
    "the model results are worse for the other positions .",
    "the fact that the ionization of the nebula is strongly overpredicted could be due to : 1 ) a too high ionization parameter @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ionizing photon rate , @xmath22 the hydrogen number density and @xmath23 the distance to the ionizing source .",
    "] , 2 ) a too high stellar effective temperature .",
    "notice that this model was obtained using only the high density component ( @xmath24 ) . adding any contribution of the low density component would made the situation even worse .",
    "as @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 are well constrained through the _ hipparcos _ distance to the object , its observed angular size , the observed stellar luminosity and the nebular density coming from the plasma diagnostic , then it follows that @xmath20 is also well constrained .",
    "the only remaining way to reproduce the observed low value of the [ o iii]/[o ii ] line ratio is to consider a star with a temperature lower than the value derived for model _ star1 _ , i.e. , we must not deal with the number of ionization photons but rather with their energy .",
    "the fit improves very much when we use the model _",
    "star3 _ which has @xmath26 70 000 k. the ionization of the dense gas is even lower than observed , leading to the full use of our hypothesis of the 2-components model .",
    "the predicted emission lines from the corresponding photoionization model are compared with observations in table  [ tab : res2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that almost all the fluxes are well reproduced , indicating that the star wr 136 emits the uv ionizing photons corresponding to a star with this low effective temperature .",
    "as it can be seen in figure  [ fig : stelspec ] and it was discussed in  4.1 , at least three stellar models , ( _ star1 , star2 _ and _ star3 _ ) with different @xmath27 and therefore a different @xmath28 fit similarly well the stellar observations , in particular the stellar continuum and several emission lines .",
    "the differences among these models appear mainly in the he lines , where the he ii / he i line ratio is well reproduced when considering an effective temperature of 110 000 k but it is understimated when the effective temperature is reduced , i.e. , at a lower stellar temperature the stellar he i lines are stronger and the stellar he ii lines become weaker than observed . as we discussed before , it seems that there is not a unique solution for the stellar model .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectrauv ] we show a comparison between the uv region of the stellar models from table  [ tab : w136 ] .",
    "we also overplot the uv behaviour of two blackbodies with temperatures of 70 000 and 46 000 k which correspond to the temperatures @xmath27 and @xmath29 of model _",
    "we can see that the key difference between the stellar models comes from the far uv region of the spectra , whose uv photons are absorbed by the nebula ( between 1.0 and @xmath10 7.0 ryd ) .",
    "this difference is well appreciated when we compare the models with the blackbodies . from this figure",
    "it is clear that a blackbody with the same temperature than the modelled spectra , 70 000 or even 46 000 k , shows an excess of uv photons which would lead to a much more ionized nebula .",
    "it is also evident the high absorption of the uv photons emitted by the star , due to the presence of the stellar wind .",
    "owing to there are not stellar observations in the far uv to discriminate which stellar model is reproducing the real spectral energy distribution of the star wr 136 , it is necessary to add an external restriction . in this case ,",
    "such additional restriction is the associated nebula ngc 6888 that is highly sensitive to this uv ionizing radiation .",
    "in addition , the combination of the temperature and mass - loss effects in the stellar wind , considered for this model , can reproduce the line profiles coming from recombination process . therefore",
    ", if we are close to a good value for @xmath27 , it is the same for the mass - loss rate , @xmath30 .",
    "this is important because @xmath30 represents a good constrain for the hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "as in this study we have found a well constrained value for @xmath30 ( log @xmath30 = @xmath184.95 ) , which is similar to the values found by other authors ( table  [ tab : w136 ] ) , we can rule out the assumption made recently by @xcite where they conclude that it is necessary a @xmath30 3 - 4 times lower than observed for this type of stars to reproduce the x - ray flux of the emitting hot bubble .    . the black solid line and the dashed line correspond to blackbodies of 70 000 and 46 000 k , respectively ,",
    "according to the temperatures @xmath27 and @xmath29 of model _",
    "star3_.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]          the presence of a very fast stellar wind coming from the star wr 136 could imply that part of the ionization of the gas is due to shocks .",
    "diagrams made by @xcite and @xcite are usually employed to determine if a line emitting region is mainly ionized by ob stars ( like h ii regions ) or by other source ( agn , liners , shocks ) .",
    "see for example @xcite for the case of shocks .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bpt ] we show an [ oiii]5007/h@xmath31 vs. [ nii ] 6584/h@xmath4 diagram .",
    "the solid line shows the separation between global photoionization models for star forming regions ( nsf galaxies ) and agns as defined by @xcite .",
    "the dashed line represents the same separation , but shifted on the log ( [ n ii ] 6584/h@xmath4 ) axis by 0.96 dex , which is the difference between the n / o adopted by @xcite and the n / o of ngc 6888 deduced in this work .",
    "the three black diamonds correspond to observations for positions a , b and c and are obviously located to the right side of the solid line , but well inside the photoionized zone with n / o ratio similar to ngc 6888 value .    the effect of a limited aperture size , which is not including the whole nebula is illustrated by the position of the color points in our fig .",
    "[ fig : bpt ] .",
    "they show the emission line ratios of every spaxel of our 2d images obtained from our models .",
    "the colors correspond to different values of @xmath32 ( the weight of the dense component ) , the blue symbols are obtained for the case of considering only the low - density component , and the red ones for the case of considering only the high - density component , the green symbols being an intermediate situation .",
    "as we can see , the points spread in an ample region of the diagram .",
    "the black square symbol is the position in the diagram of the global model , as if it were fully included in the slit .",
    "therefore if just a small portion of a whole nebula is observed , one must be careful in using diagnostic diagrams to decide if the emission of a nebula is caused by the presence of shocks , because as we demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpt ] only photoionization and an enhanced n abundance are sufficient to obtain points located out of the regions represented by global photoionized models ( solid line ) .      to deeper investigate our assumption of chemical homogeneity of ngc 6888 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpt ] we added the observations by ev92 , m - d14 .",
    "it is found that they lie inside or close to our model points .",
    "also we added the observations by fm12 ( marked as black dots and stars ) resulting from their 1d analysis of different regions of ngc 6888 .",
    "we can see that their points show a large spread in this diagram . to explain the behaviour of their observations and to derive values of the n and o abundances",
    ", fm12 performed a grid of photoionization models using the code cloudy varying the ionization parameter and the n / o ratio . as they used global models for each observation without taking into account that they were observing only a part of the nebula they concluded that there are important differences in the n / o ratio across ngc 6888 .",
    "however , our figure shows that this is not necessarily the case . in particular ,",
    "let us focus on the data of fm12 marked as black dots , which correspond to their regions inside ngc 6888 with large nitrogen enrichment .",
    "we can see that all these points , but the point labeled x2 in their paper , are close to our model points and are following their trend .",
    "the rest of the points ( stars ) show a large dispersion compared to our model points and it is not expected for the model to reproduce their positions because they belong to regions located out from the edge of ngc 6888 with low ( solar ) nitrogen abundance .    therefore , figure  [ fig : bpt ] illustrates the fact that all the observed points _ within _ the nebula can be reproduced by a rather simple chemically homogeneous model .    /o@xmath3",
    "ratio from a quadrant of our best photoionization model which is chemically homogeneous .",
    "the star is assumed to be at the origin of the map .",
    "three different values of _ w _ were used to show how the values of the icf changes over the whole structure of nebula .",
    "our positions and the position of fm12 are shown . ]    to continue the discussion about the chemical homogeneity in ngc 6888 , we analyse the behaviour of the icf used to determine the n / o ratio .",
    "let us remember that it is generally assumed that n@xmath3/o@xmath3 is equal to n / o .    from our photoionization model , we are able to determine in each region of the nebula the icf needed for the n@xmath3/o@xmath3 ratio to obtain the n / o value .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : no ] a map of this icf for three different values of _ w _ : 10@xmath33 , 10@xmath34 and 10@xmath35 .",
    "it is evident that for a given _ w _ , this icf varies over the nebula showing a difference as large as a factor of two . in adittion",
    ", we can see that the value of this icf changes as the contribution of the high - density component is modified .",
    "for example , in the case when _",
    "w _ = 10@xmath35 , the icf for position a is around 1.0 . in general",
    ", we can see in figure  [ fig : no ] that for positions closer to the star the icf is around 1.5 or larger .",
    "therefore , in the zones near to the star an icf greater than one is needed to estimate the n / o ratio .",
    "hence , this indicates that n / o could be understimated when it is simply assumed that n@xmath3/o@xmath3 is equal to n / o .",
    "in this way , to calculate the nitrogen abundance for position b2 of fm12 and for ev92 a better value for this icf is 1.5 . once this icf is used for these positions the n / o ratio increases relative to the values in table  [ tab : par ] , to 0.47 for ev92 and @xmath180.15 for b2 fm12 .",
    "therefore these values are still discrepant .",
    "in particular , for the position b2 the n / o ratio reaches a value of @xmath180.15 lower than the others for the rim , which is contrary to the predictions of stellar evolution models .",
    "the differences seen of the icf in different zones of the map are due to the combination of two effects : the ionization structure of the nebula and the relative contribution to the fluxes of the high density clumpy region .",
    "a similar problem with the icfs is affecting the results of @xcite who used _ herschel _ observations of the [ o iii ] 88 @xmath11 m and [ n iii ] 57 @xmath11 m lines , emitted in two positions of ngc 6888 , to determine the n / o abundance ratio under the assumption that n@xmath19/o@xmath19 is equal to n / o .",
    "for ngc 6888 this is a very rough approximation because only a small fraction of the nebula was included in their slits and @xcite did not take into account the nebular ionization structure , which indicates that the ion n@xmath19 is only dominant over n@xmath3 in the zones near to the star .",
    "the previous discussion illustrates very well that detailed modelling ( even the simplest as we do here : 2 almost roundish homogeneous components ) is a very powerful way to identify effects that , if not considered , can easily drive the observer to wrong conclusions .",
    "we computed several atmosphere models using the code cmfgen to reproduce the stellar observations of wr 136 .",
    "the characteristics of the star such as @xmath36 , @xmath30 and @xmath37 agree with the values found by other authors , i.e. , hgl06 and @xcite .",
    "we also derived the stellar abundances of he , c , n , o , si , p , s and fe ( listed in table  [ tab : abun ] ) which agree with hgl06 s model .    we find that models with very different effective temperature , @xmath27 from 70 000 k to 110 000 k , can reproduce fairly well the stellar continuum and several emission lines , although the he lines , indicative of temperature , are worse reproduced by the cooler models .",
    "therefore there is a degeneracy in atmosphere models , than apparently , as pointed out by @xcite , is due to our misunderstanding of the structure of the wind velocity field .    to decide which stellar model produces the correct uv amount of ionizing photons coming from wr 136",
    ", we computed a photoionization model for the associated ring nebula ngc 6888 , using the sed produced by the stellar models .",
    "this led us to conclude that wr 136 follows better the spectral behaviour of a star with a @xmath27 of 70 kk .",
    "the photoionization model was built assuming chemical homogeneity and including two components : a low - density region enclosing a denser region .",
    "when these two gaseous components are considered and assuming only photoionization , we were capable to reproduce the observed ionization structure in both shells , contrary to the presence of shocks as the probable mechanism producing the observed ionization structure of ngc 6888 .",
    "we can not immediatly rule out the importance of shock effects , but given that some diagnostic diagram such as the [ o iii ] 5007/h@xmath31 vs. [ n ii ] 6584/h@xmath4 indicate emission of h ii type , and that we can reproduce several emission features of the nebula by only assuming photoionization , we established that the photoionization heating is more important than the presence of shocks .",
    "this latter idea was already mentionned by ev92 combining the diagnostic diagrams of @xcite with their observations in a zone close to the central star and shown in figure  [ fig : slit ] .",
    "the nebular abundances derived from our photoionization model are similar to the values derived from our position a and the values reported by ev92 and m - d14 .",
    "it is worth to notice that both the stellar atmosphere of wr 136 and the nebular plasma present a large n- and c - enhancement and an o depletion , as it can be seen in table  [ tab : abun ] .",
    "this contributes to the idea that the observed gas was ejected by the central star through the mass - loss driven by the stellar wind .",
    "considering only photoionization and a chemically homogeneous nebula , we were able to explain the pretended differences found in the n / o ratio ( derived from n@xmath3/o@xmath3 or n@xmath19/o@xmath19 in different zones of the nebula ) by fm12 and @xcite , who proposed a chemically inhomogeneous nebula .",
    "these pretended differences are due to effects of the ionization structure within the nebula . with our simple model",
    "we show that the icfs for global nebulae should not be use for observations of small zones observed in extended nebulae .    from our results",
    "we have learned that there are several stellar models with different set of values that could reproduce the observables , like the models _",
    "star1 _ and _ star3 _ presented in this study",
    ". therefore external constraints are crucial to determine which atmosphere models represent the real stellar properties .",
    "the nebulae around stars can help to deal with the degeneracy mentioned above .",
    "finally , in this work we show the advantages of modelling simultaneously the stellar and nebular spectra of a wolf - rayet star plus nebula system .",
    "we verify whether a stellar atmosphere model of the star wr 136 provides a good description of the stellar observations and is able to satisfactorily reproduce the nebular characteristics such as the ionization degree .",
    "this allow us to better constraint all the physical parameters of both the star and the nebula , including their physical conditions and their chemical abundances .",

    "<S> we analyse whether a stellar atmosphere model computed with the code cmfgen provides an optimal description of the stellar observations of wr 136 and simultaneously reproduces the nebular observations of ngc 6888 , such as the ionization degree , which is modelled with the pycloudy code . </S>",
    "<S> all the observational material available ( far and near uv and optical spectra ) were used to constrain such models . </S>",
    "<S> we found that even when the stellar luminosity and the mass - loss rate were well constrained , the stellar temperature @xmath0 at @xmath1 = 20 , can be in a range between 70 000 and 110 000 k. when using the nebula as an additional restriction we found that the stellar models with @xmath2 70 000 k represent the best solution for both , the star and the nebula . </S>",
    "<S> results from the photoionization model show that if we consider a chemically homogeneous nebula , the observed n@xmath3/o@xmath3 ratios found in different nebular zones can be reproduced , therefore it is not necessary to assume a chemical inhomogeneous nebula . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows the importance of calculating coherent models including stellar and nebular constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to determine , in a consistent way , all the physical parameters of both the star and its associated nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical abundances derived are 12 + log(n / h ) = 9.95 , 12 + log(c / h ) = 7.84 and 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.76 for the star and 12 + log(n / h ) = 8.40 , 12 + log(c / h ) = 8.86 and 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.20 . </S>",
