    "metastable states are observed when a physical system is close to a first order phase transition .",
    "well known examples are super - saturated vapor states and magnetic hystereses  @xcite . in the figure  [ fig : isteresi ]",
    "the isotherms of a ferromagnet are depicted on the left ; @xmath0 denotes the temperature , @xmath1 the magnetization , i.e. , the density of total magnetic moment , @xmath2 the external magnetic field , @xmath3 the spontaneous magnetization , and @xmath4 the curie temperature . at",
    "temperature higher than @xmath4 the magnetization is zero for @xmath5 ; it is said that the system is in the _ paramagnetic _ phase  @xcite .",
    "below the critical temperature at @xmath5 the system can exhibit the not zero values @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; it is said that the system is in the _ ferromagnetic _ phase . for @xmath5 , when the temperature reaches the _ critical _ value @xmath4 the system undergoes a _ continuous _ ( _ second order _ ) phase transition ;",
    "the name is justified since the _ order parameter _",
    "@xmath1 varies continuously when @xmath4 is crossed .    in the graph on the right in figure",
    "[ fig : isteresi ] the behavior of the ferromagnet at @xmath0 smaller than @xmath4 is illustrated .",
    "when @xmath5 the system jumps from the positive magnetization phase to the negative magnetization one , or vice - versa ; the transition is called _ first order _ since the order parameter @xmath1 , which is the first derivative of one of the thermodynamical potential , undergoes an abrupt variation  @xcite . sometimes , provided the value @xmath5 is crossed sweetly in the experiment , the system persists in the same phase and the _ hysteresis _ in the picture is observed .",
    "it is then said that the phase with negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) magnetization is _ metastable _ for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "@xmath10 ) small .",
    "the rigorous mathematical description of this phenomenon is relatively recent .",
    "not completely rigorous approaches based on equilibrium states have been developed in different fashions .",
    "the purely dynamical point of view revealed more powerful and leaded to a pretty elegant definition and characterization of the metastable states ; the most important results in this respect have been summed up in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we stick to the dynamical description and investigate competing metastable states .",
    "this problem shows up in connection with many physical processes , such as the crystallization of proteins @xcite and in glasses , in which the presence of a huge number of minima of the energy landscape prevents the system from reaching the equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the study of these systems is difficult , since the minima of the energy and the decay pathways between them change when the control parameters are varied .",
    "it is then of interest the study of models in which a complete control of the variations induced on the energy landscape by changes in the parameters is possible . in section  [ blume ]",
    "we discuss the metastable behavior of the blume  capel model relying on results in  @xcite . in section  [ pca ]",
    "the obtained result will be compared with the known metastable behavior of reversible probabilistic cellular automata with self  interaction .",
    "the blume  capel model has been introduced in  @xcite in connection with the liquid helium transition . in the context of metastability",
    "this model revealed very interesting for the three  fold nature of its ground states , see  @xcite .",
    "consider the two  dimensional torus @xmath11 , with @xmath12 even , endowed with the euclidean metric ; @xmath13 are _ nearest neighbors _ iff their mutual distance is equal to @xmath14 . associate a variable @xmath15 with each site @xmath16 and let @xmath17 be the _ configuration space_. the _ energy _ associated to the configuration @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes a generic pair of nearest neighbors sites in the torus @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the _ chemical potential _ , @xmath23 is the _ external magnetic field _ , and @xmath24 .",
    "the function @xmath25 will be also called _",
    "hamiltonian_. the equilibrium behavior of the system",
    "is described by the _ gibbs measure _ @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the inverse of the temperature and the normalization constant @xmath28 is called _ partition function_.    it is possible to introduce the stochastic version of the model by defining a serial dynamics reversible w.r.t .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham - blume ] ) .",
    "it will be a discrete time glauber dynamics , that is a markov chain with state space @xmath29 and _ transition matrix _",
    "@xmath30 $ ] such that @xmath31 for @xmath32 such @xmath33 and @xmath34 are _ nearest neighboring configurations _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath33 is equal to @xmath34 excepted for the value of the spin associated to a single site ; @xmath35 for @xmath32 such that @xmath36 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not nearest neighboring , that is to say they differ for the values of the spins associated to at least two sites .",
    "to ensure the correct normalization of the transition matrix , we also set @xmath37 for any @xmath18 .",
    "this dynamics , called _ metropolis algorithm _ , satisfies the two following important properties : ( i ) only transitions between nearest neighboring configurations are allowed ; ( ii ) the dynamics is _ reversible _ w.r.t .  the hamiltonian ( [ ham - blume ] ) , i.e. , @xmath38 for any @xmath32 .",
    "the equation ( [ dettagliato ] ) is called _ detailed balance _ condition .",
    "the definition ( [ metro01 ] ) of the dynamics implies that transitions decreasing the energy happen with finite probability , \" while transitions increasing the energy are performed with probability tending to zero for @xmath39 , that is when the temperature tends to zero .",
    "this means that when the temperature is small , the system takes a time exponentially large in @xmath27 to leave a _ local minimum _ of the hamiltonian , i.e. , a configuration @xmath18 such that @xmath40 for any @xmath41 nearest neighbor of @xmath33 .",
    "we can then expect that , wherever started , the systems tends to reach the _ ground state _ of the energy , i.e. , the minimum of @xmath25 , in a _ tunneling time _ depending on the initial condition .",
    "supposing that there exists initial data for which the tunneling time is exponentially large in @xmath27 , it is rather natural to define the metastable state as the configuration to which corresponds the maximum tunneling time .",
    "more precisely , following  @xcite and referring to the figure  [ fig : definizione ] for a description of the following definitions , given a sequence of configurations @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , we define the _ energy height _ along the path @xmath44 as @xmath45 . given @xmath46",
    ", we let the _ communication energy _ @xmath47 between @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the minimal energy height @xmath50 over the set of paths @xmath44 starting in @xmath48 and ending in @xmath49 . for any @xmath18 ,",
    "we let @xmath51 be the set of configurations with energy strictly below @xmath52 and @xmath53 be the _ stability level of _",
    "@xmath33 , that is the energy barrier that , starting from @xmath33 , must be overcome to reach the set of configurations with energy smaller than @xmath52 ; we set @xmath54 if @xmath55 .",
    "we denote by @xmath56 the set of global minima of the energy ( [ ham - blume ] ) , i.e. , the collection of the ground states , and suppose that the _ communication energy _",
    "@xmath57 is strictly positive .",
    "finally , we define the set of _ metastable states _",
    "the set @xmath59 deserves its name , since in a rather general framework it is possible to prove ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.9 ) ) the following : pick @xmath60 , consider the chain @xmath61 started at @xmath62 , then the _ first hitting time _",
    "@xmath63 to the ground states is a random variable with mean exponentially large in @xmath27 , that is @xmath64=\\gamma\\ ] ] with @xmath65 the average on the trajectories started at @xmath33 .",
    "in the considered regime , finite volume and temperature tending to zero , the description of metastability is then reduced to the computation of @xmath56 , @xmath66 , and @xmath59 .    after this rather general discussion on the definition of metastable states we get back to the study of the blume  capel model and note that rigorous results have already been found in  @xcite in the region @xmath67 . in this section",
    "we review those results on heuristic grounds and extend the discussion to the whole region @xmath9 and @xmath68 .",
    "first of all we describe the structure of the ground states of the hamiltonian .",
    "denote by @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 the configurations with all the spins in @xmath21 equal respectively to @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and remark that @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that for @xmath78 the ground state is three times degenerate and the configurations minimizing the hamiltonian are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; for @xmath9 and @xmath68 , the ground state is @xmath70 ; for @xmath10 and @xmath79 the ground state is @xmath69 ; for @xmath80 and @xmath81 the ground state is @xmath71 ; for @xmath82 the ground state is two times degenerate and the configurations minimizing the hamiltonian are @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; for @xmath83 the ground state is two times degenerate and the configurations minimizing the hamiltonian are @xmath69 and @xmath71 ; for @xmath84 the ground state is two times degenerate and the configurations minimizing the hamiltonian are @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these results are summarized in the graph in the left in figure  [ fig : blume ] .",
    "note , also , that @xmath85 for @xmath86 , @xmath87 for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 , see the two graphs on the right in the figure  [ fig : blume ] .",
    "the obvious candidates to be metastable states are the configurations @xmath91 or @xmath92 ; in particular the situation in the region @xmath67 looks really intriguing . in order to prove rigorously that one of them is the metastable state , one should compute @xmath66 and prove that either @xmath93 or @xmath94 is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "this is a difficult task , indeed all the paths @xmath44 connecting @xmath69 and @xmath71 to @xmath70 should be taken into account and the related energy heights @xmath50 computed .",
    "this problem has been solved rigorously in  @xcite in the region @xmath67 under the technical restriction @xmath95 .",
    "there it has been proven that the metastable state is @xmath69 and that , depending on the ration @xmath96 , during the tunneling from the metastable to the stable state the configuration @xmath71 is visited or not visited .",
    "as mentioned above we develop an heuristic argument to characterize the behavior of the system in the whole region @xmath9 and @xmath68 . to characterize the local minima of the hamiltonian",
    ", it is necessary to compute the energy variation under the flip of a single spin .",
    "then consider @xmath18 , @xmath16 , @xmath97 , and denote by @xmath98 the configuration such that @xmath99 for all @xmath100 and @xmath101 ; note that @xmath102 iff @xmath103 . by using ( [ ham - blume ] )",
    "we easily get @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the sum of the four spins of @xmath33 associated to the nearest neighbors of the site @xmath106 .",
    "equation ( [ delta ] ) can be used to compute the energy difference involved in all the possible spin flips ; the results are summarized in the table  [ tab : blume ] . note that the three cases not listed in the table can be deduced by changing the sign accordingly , for instance if @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we get @xmath109 whose sign is positive for @xmath110 and negative for @xmath111 .",
    "it is also worth remarking that the results on the sign of the energy differences listed in the third column of the table  [ tab : blume ] strongly depend on the assumption @xmath112 .",
    "notice that the role of the zero state of the blume ",
    "capel model is played , in the context of the pca , by the flip  flopping chessboard  like configurations .",
    "as ( [ mnos4.9 ] ) shows , the discussed results are valid in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "their validity at finite temperature can be tested with monte carlo simulations , see the configurations in figure  [ fig : con ] observed in a run of the dynamics of the pca with the parameters specified in the caption and with starting configuration @xmath69 .",
    "on the left it is shown that if the self  interaction is present the nucleation of the plus phase is achieved directly ; the plot on the right shows that , if the self  interaction is zero , than the chessboard  like phase is visited before the plus phase is nucleated ."
