    "recently we have completed the analysis of the phase diagram of asymptotically free nonsupersymmetric gauge theories with two dirac fermions in a single arbitrary representation of the gauge group as function of the number of flavors and colors @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram is sketched in figure [ ph ] with the exceptions of a few isolated higher dimensional representations below nine colors @xcite .",
    "the analysis exhausts the phase diagram for gauge theories with dirac fermions in a single generic representation and is based on the ladder approximation presented in @xcite .",
    "further studies of the nonsupersymmetric conformal window and its properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "the adjoint and the two index - symmetric representations need only a very low number of flavors , almost independent of the number of colors , to be near an infrared fixed point .",
    "this fact has led to the construction of the _ minimal walking technicolor _",
    "theories @xcite .",
    "the walking dynamics was first introduced in @xcite . by walking one refers to the fact that the underlying coupling constant decreases much more slowly with the reference scale than in the case of qcd - like theories .",
    "the theoretical estimates for the nonsupersymmetric conformal window need to be tested further .",
    "the very low number of flavors needed to reach the conformal window , for certain representations , makes the minimal walking theories amenable to lattice investigations .",
    "recent lattice results @xcite show that the theory with two dirac fermions in the adjoint representation of the @xmath0 gauge group possesses dynamics which is different from the one with fermions in the fundamental representation .    here",
    ", we study the conformal window of @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theories with vector - like matter transforming according to a single but generic irreducible representation of the gauge group . the results are subsequently confronted with the nonsupersymmetric ones .",
    "we compute the fraction , for each representation , of asymptotically free theories in the flavor - color space which can develop an infrared fixed point .",
    "we find this fraction to be @xmath2 and at the same time to be a universal number independent of the specific representation .",
    "intrigued by this result we compute it in the nonsupersymmetric case as well . here",
    "we find the value @xmath3 .",
    "although there is some dependence on the representation the differences among the various representations are still small .",
    "another interesting application of our work is as a study of the theoretical landscape underlying the _ unparticle _ physics world proposed by georgi @xcite .",
    "with emphasis on the phenomenological applications , studies of the unparticle physics have recently received much attention @xcite .",
    "an interesting theoretical and phenomenological study of the cp and cpt properties of unparticle physics has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the theories presented here , belonging to the various conformal regions , are natural candidates for a _ particle _ theory description of the unparticle world following @xcite .",
    "our analysis allows us to _ size _ the unparticle world related to the existence of underlying gauge theories developing an infrared fixed point .",
    "as already reported above , with only one type of representation , in the supersymmetric case , we find that 50 % of the theories can develop an infrared fixed point while for the nonsupersymmetric theories this conformal area is about 25 % of that of all total asymptotically free ones .",
    "we expect this fraction to increase when considering multiple representations simultaneously present . in this case",
    "the conformal regions will quickly dominate over the non conformal ones . in order to estimate this amount we considered the case of multiple representations for the nonsupersymmetric case . here",
    "we find that with four different simultaneously present representations , in the nonsupersymmetric case , about 70 % of the space is filled by theories which can develop a fixed point .",
    "we have investigated gauge theories but it would be interesting to also study quantum gravity theories where the role of the infrared fixed point is replaced by the possible existence of a non trivial ultraviolet fixed point ( asymptotic safety ) @xcite .    according to our theoretical landscape survey the unparticle world , before coupling it to the standard model ,",
    "is at least as common as the particle one .",
    "the gauge sector of a supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge theory consists of a supersymmetric field strength belonging to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the supersymmetric field strength describes the gluon and the gluino .",
    "the matter sector is taken to be vectorial and to consist of @xmath4 chiral superfields @xmath5 in the representation @xmath6 of the gauge group and @xmath4 chiral superfields @xmath7 in the conjugate representation @xmath8 of the gauge group .",
    "the chiral superfield @xmath5 ( or @xmath7 ) contains a weyl fermion and a complex scalar boson .",
    "the generators @xmath9 of the gauge group in the representation @xmath6 are normalized according to @xmath10 = t(r ) \\delta^{ab}$ ] while the quadratic casimir @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the trace normalization factor @xmath13 and the quadratic casimir are connected via @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimension of the representation @xmath6 .",
    "the adjoint representation is denoted by @xmath16 . with this notation",
    "we summarize the symmetries of the theory in table [ k=1 ] .",
    ".summary of the local and global symmetries and charge assignments of the generic @xmath17 gauge theory with matter in a given representation @xmath6 of the gauge group . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have only listed the results for all of the representations which can remain asymptotically free for large @xmath18 .",
    "these are the fundamental and the two - indexed representations . in this case",
    "one can take @xmath19 to infinity .",
    "the analysis of the phase diagram presented here with mixed representations is of immediate use for various phenomenological studies .",
    "it allows , for example , the study and construction of explicit _ split technicolor _ theories introduced in @xcite .",
    "these are walking technicolor theories having matter in different representations of the gauge group .",
    "hence we further enlarge the parameter space of theories ( see @xcite ) which can be used to break the electroweak theory dynamically .",
    "we expect similar results in the case of supersymmetric theories . in the susy case , however , in evaluating the conformal regions one has to pay special attention to the fact that when multiple representations are present the @xmath20-anomaly free charge for the different chiral multiplets is no longer uniquely determined via the single anomaly - free condition but one has to resort to extra conditions .",
    "one can use , for example , the recently important fact discovered by intriligator and wecht @xcite that the exact superconformal r - symmetry maximizes the central charge @xmath21 of the 4d scft @xcite which has already led to interesting applications @xcite .",
    "we have constructed the conformal window for arbitrary representations of the gauge group for @xmath17 supersymmetric gauge theories and compared it with the one for nonsupersymmetric theories .",
    "we have then defined a measure in theory space allowing us to size the fraction of asymptotically free gauge theories developing an infrared fixed point .",
    "we have discovered that this fraction depends uniquely on the representation contributing to the dynamics but not on the specific choice .",
    "this is an exact result in supersymmetric theories while it is an approximate one in the nonsupersymmetric case .",
    "according to our findings the four - dimensional unparticle world occupies a sizable amount of the particle world , at least in theory space , and before mixing it ( at the operator level ) with the nonconformal one .",
    "our results can also be used to further enlarge the number of walking theories which can be used to break the electroweak theory .",
