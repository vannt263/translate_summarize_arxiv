    "redshift surveys have shown that the clustering properties of galaxies strongly depend on their luminosity , color and morphological ( or spectral ) type ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that galaxies do not perfectly trace the distribution of the underlying dark matter , a phenomenon commonly referred to as ` galaxy biasing ' .",
    "its origin lies in the details of the galaxy formation process which is shaped by the interplay between complex hydrodynamical and radiative processes together with the dark - matter driven formation of the large - scale structure .",
    "attempts to infer cosmological parameters from galaxy clustering studies are severely hampered by galaxy biasing .",
    "a number of theoretical arguments and the outcome of numerical simulations both suggest that , on sufficiently large scales , the power spectra of galaxies and matter should be proportional to each other : @xmath5 where the linear bias factor @xmath6 depends on galaxy type but is generally scale independent ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , to model higher - order statistics , such as the galaxy bispectrum , it is generally assumed that galaxy biasing is a local process such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the ( smoothed ) galaxy and dark - matter density contrast , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the reliance of these phenomenological approximations limits cosmological studies to very large scales whereas data with better signal - to - noise ratio are already available on much smaller scales .",
    "moreover , future studies of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) will require measurements of the matter power - spectrum with percent or even sub - percent accuracy in order to shed new light on the source of cosmic acceleration .",
    "understanding and controlling the effects of galaxy biasing with this precision will be challenging .",
    "all this provides a very strong motivation for developing more accurate ( and physically driven ) models of galaxy biasing .",
    "a number of authors have used the power spectrum statistics to explore the scale dependence of galaxy biasing based on numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or analytical calculations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) stemming from either perturbation theory or the halo model for the large - scale structure ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the general picture is that galaxy biasing is expected to be scale dependent ( i.e. @xmath10 ) and the functional form of @xmath11 can sensibly depend on the selected tracer of the large - scale structure .    since galaxies are expected to form within dark - matter haloes , understanding the clustering properties of the haloes is a key step to accurately model galaxy biasing .",
    "this is a much simpler problem , considering that dark - matter haloes form under the sole action of gravity .",
    "it is in fact expected that long - wavelength density fluctuations modulate halo formation by modifying the collapse time of localized short - wavelength density peaks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this argument ( known as the peak - background split ) predicts that , on large scales , the halo overdensity @xmath12 where the bias coefficient @xmath13 varies with the halo mass @xcite . the numerical value of the bias coefficient is determined by two different occurrences : first , haloes form out of highly biased regions in the linear density field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and , second , they move over time as they are accelerated towards the densest regions of the large - scale structure by gravity @xcite .",
    "these two phenomena generally go under the name of `` lagrangian biasing '' and `` lagrangian to eulerian passage '' , respectively . @xcite",
    "dealt with the second problem by assuming that long - wavelength density perturbations evolve according to the spherical top - hat model .",
    "a more sophisticated generalization of the peak - background split has been presented by @xcite who assumed that also the large - scale motion of the density `` peaks '' is fully determined by the long - wavelength component of the density field . since the halo population and the matter feel the same large - scale gravitational potential , their density fluctuations are strongly coupled and their time evolution must be solved simultaneously .",
    "this makes the process of halo biasing non - linear and non - local even if one starts from a linear and local lagrangian biasing scheme ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bispectrum can be used to test this model against the standard eulerian local biasing scheme @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a novel and very promising approach to model the clustering of dark matter haloes . adopting the formalism by @xcite combined with a non - local lagrangian biasing scheme for the haloes @xcite",
    ", we simultaneously follow the growth of perturbations in the matter and in the halo distribution over cosmic time .",
    "we present perturbative solutions for the corresponding overdensity and velocity fields and we are able to resum the perturbative series in the limit of large wavenumbers .",
    "moreover , we write down a system of equations for the power spectra @xmath14 and @xmath15 using the time - renormalization - group ( trg ) approach by @xcite and numerically integrate them .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with the output of a high - resolution n - body simulation , showing an improvement over linear theory , and we are able to predict the matter - halo cross spectrum with a precision within @xmath2 per cent for @xmath16 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "related work has been very recently presented by @xcite who computed the two - point correlation function of linear density peaks and followed its time evolution assuming that peaks move according to the zeldovich approximation . for massive haloes",
    "this results in a scale - dependent bias ( with variations of @xmath17 per cent ) on the scales relevant for baryonic - oscillation studies .",
    "contrary to their approach , we do not deal with a point process but describe large - scale fluctuations in the distribution of dark - matter haloes as perturbations in a continuous fluid . on the other hand ,",
    "we account for the full gravitational motion of the haloes and do not rely on simplified dynamical models as like as the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section [ mod ]",
    "we present our model for the joint evolution of the matter and halo power spectra .",
    "the initial conditions for our evolutionary equations are discussed in section [ init ] .",
    "the solution of the linearized equations is presented in section [ lin ] where we also quantify the importance of the halo velocity bias .",
    "using a perturbative technique , in section [ analit ] we compute analytic solutions for the propagator of perturbations ( the two - time correlator ) .",
    "we derive 1-loop corrections and , in the limit of large wavenumbers , the fully resummed propagator .",
    "the discussion in sections [ comp1 ] and [ comp2 ] is very technical and the less experienced readers can safely skip it without compromising understanding of the remainder . in section [ num ] , we numerically integrate the full equations for the evolution of halo and matter power spectra in the trg formalism .",
    "we then compare the results against the outcome of a high - resolution n - body simulation .",
    "finally , in section [ con ] we conclude .",
    "the large - scale structure observed today in the universe is believed to be the result of gravitational amplification of primordial fluctuations , caused by the interaction among cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles .",
    "if we denote @xmath9 as the matter density contrast and @xmath18 as the velocity , the eulerian dynamics of a system of such particles , which interact only via gravity , is ruled by a set of three equations ( continuity , euler and poisson ) that in a @xmath19cdm model reads : @xmath20=0\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial\\,{\\bf v}}{\\partial\\,\\tau}+{\\cal h}\\,{\\bf v}\\ , + ( { \\bf v }   \\cdot { \\bf \\nabla } )   { \\bf v}= - { \\bf \\nabla } \\phi\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{3}{2}\\,\\,{\\cal h}^2   \\,\\omega_m \\ , \\delta_m \\ , , \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the conformal time . if we define the velocity divergence @xmath22 and switch to fourier space , the equations in ( [ a ] ) become : @xmath23 where @xmath24 equations ( [ b ] ) can be written in a compact form if we define a new time variable @xmath25 , being @xmath26 the growth factor at an early epoch , and a doublet @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the velocity divergence is scaled such that it has the same dimension of the density contrast and in the linear regime @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 . the system is therefore @xmath33 where sum over repeated indices and integration over repeated momenta are understood .",
    "the vertex function @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) has only three non - vanishing elements @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the dirac - delta distribution .",
    "all the information about the cosmological model is contained in the matrix @xmath39 that , in the following , will be considered as a constant matrix , approximating @xmath40 .",
    "this ratio is indeed very close to unity for most of the history of the universe . making this approximation ,",
    "one is modifying the behavior of the decaying mode , while the growing one is left unaltered .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that it affects the matter power spectrum at @xmath1 at a less than percent level up to @xmath41 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "+ the power spectrum , defined by an ensemble average , in this notation is a @xmath42 matrix @xmath43 and the bispectrum , defined by @xmath44 has 8 components . in the following , we will also consider a different - time two - point correlator , defined as @xmath45 which obviously coincides with ( [ h ] ) for @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider a set of dark - matter haloes identified at a given redshift @xmath47 according to some predefined criterion .",
    "the material that forms the haloes can be traced back to its initial location in the linear overdensity field at @xmath48 .",
    "we dub each of these regions as a proto - halo . in other words ,",
    "a proto - halo is the lagrangian region of space that will collapse to form a halo at redshift @xmath47 .",
    "n - body simulations show that nearly all proto - haloes are simply connected @xcite even though this property is not key to our analysis .",
    "let us now follow the evolution of a proto - halo over cosmic time in eulerian space . basically its shape and topology will be distorted ( proto - haloes will first fragment into smaller substructures that will later merge to form the final halo ) and its overall volume will be compressed while its centre of mass will move along a given trajectory determined by the mass density field via gravity .",
    "we focus our analysis onto this motion that connects the lagrangian position of the proto - halo with the eulerian location of the final halo .    on scales",
    "much larger than the characteristic size of ( and separation between ) the proto - haloes , the density fluctuations traced by the centre - of - mass trajectories can be described with a continuous overdensity field @xmath49 .",
    "note that while @xmath21 labels conformal time along the trajectories , @xmath47 is just a tag that identifies the halo population . unlike real haloes that undergo merging , by construction proto - haloes always preserve their identity .",
    "their total number is therefore conserved over time and we can write a continuity equation for their number density : @xmath50=0\\;. \\label{j}\\ ] ] here the proto - halo density and velocity fields should be intended as coarse grained on a scale of a few times the mean inter - halo separation ( so as to suppress discreteness effects as proto - haloes are individually separate units ) . strictly speaking , the smoothed velocity field does not obey the euler - poisson system in equation ( [ a ] ) due to the presence of the non - linear term @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , the coarse graining procedure introduces new terms in the fluid equations generated by the degrees of freedom one has integrated out , namely : a velocity dispersion term and a correction to the mean- field gravitational acceleration due to density fluctuations on scales smaller than the smoothing radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is reasonable to assume that the large - scale motion of the proto - haloes is generated by density fluctuations with wavelength larger than the characteristic halo size and is not influenced by perturbations with shorter wavelength .",
    "the very same assumption of neglecting the coupling to the small scales is routinely done when one writes equation ( [ a ] ) for the mass density field ( see section 3 in @xcite ) albeit adopting much narrower smoothing kernels than for the haloes .    with the same spirit , in what follows , we will ignore the extra terms in the fluid equations generated by the coarse graining procedure .",
    "this is a working hypothesis which makes the problem mathematically treatable and whose accuracy will be tested by comparing our final results against high - resolution numerical simulations .",
    "we therefore write an euler equation for the proto - halo fluid velocities @xmath52 where the gravitational potential is the same as in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "note that if @xmath53 matches @xmath18 in the initial conditions then it will always do . on the contrary ,",
    "any initial velocity bias between proto - halos and matter will be progressively erased by the gravitational acceleration .",
    "thus , given suitable initial conditions for @xmath54 and @xmath53 at @xmath55 ( i.e. a prescription for the lagrangian biasing of proto - haloes ) , we can in principle use equations ( [ j ] ) and ( [ jj ] ) to follow the clustering evolution of the proto - halo population at all times .",
    "we are particularly interested in the solution of the fluid equations at the special time @xmath21 that corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "in fact this solution has a particular physical meaning as it gives the density and velocity fields of the actual dark - matter haloes .      the system ( [ a ] )",
    "is now extended by the inclusion of eq .",

    "we define a quadruplet @xmath27 ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 in such a way that eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) still holds , but with indices running from 1 to 4 .",
    "there are three more non - vanishing elements of the vertex @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the @xmath60 @xmath61 matrix is @xmath62    from the definitions ( [ h ] ) and ( [ i ] ) , with @xmath56 , we get a @xmath63 matrix for power spectrum ; in the following , we will focus on the matter power spectrum @xmath64 and the matter - halo cross spectrum @xmath65 .",
    "in the previous section , we have presented a model that describes the non - linear evolution of the matter and halo density fields . given suitable initial conditions , the formal equations we have introduced can be integrated numerically so that to compute the perturbative propagators and the trg - evolved power spectra .",
    "the choice of the initial conditions therefore plays a very important role in our theory and will be the subject of this section .      to gain insight into the properties of proto - haloes ( and , later , to test our results at @xmath1 ) , we use one high - resolution n - body simulation extracted from the suite presented by pillepich et al .",
    "this contains @xmath66 dark - matter particles within a periodic cubic box with a side of @xmath67 mpc and follows the formation of structure in a @xmath19cdm model with gaussian initial conditions and cosmological parameters : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we identify dark - matter haloes at @xmath1 using the friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length equal to 0.2 times the mean interparticle distance .",
    "we only consider haloes containing more than 100 particles ( i.e. with mass @xmath74 ) and we split them into four mass bins to keep track of their different clustering properties .",
    "the corresponding mass ranges and the total number of haloes in each bin are given in table [ tab:1 ] , along with an estimate of the highest wavevector up to which the fluid approximation for haloes holds .",
    "this value is determined by the number of haloes we require to be in a volume element to consider them as a fluid , and we set this number to 30 . on smaller scales ,",
    "our assumption breaks down , therefore we will look at results in the specified range , that , of course , decreases as the mass of the haloes increases . in the plots that will be shown in section [ num ] the limit to which we can trust our model will be represented by vertical black dotted lines .",
    "proto - haloes are identified by tracing the positions of the particles forming a halo at @xmath1 back to the linear density field .",
    "the centre of mass of each proto - halo is used as a proxy for its spatial location .",
    "similarly , the mass weighted linear velocity gives the proto - halo velocity .",
    "halo and proto - halo density and momentum fields are computed with the cloud - in - cell grid assignement using a @xmath75 mesh .",
    "velocity fields are obtained by taking the ratio of the momentum and density distributions ( preventively smoothed to preclude the existence of empty cells ) as shown in @xcite .",
    "power spectra have been computed using fft . in order to avoid uncertain shot - noise corrections for the haloes",
    ", we only consider their cross spectra with the matter density field .      concerning the matter density ,",
    "the initial conditions are given by linear theory which directly follows from the adopted cosmological model ( transfer function ) and the statistics of primordial perturbations ( spectral index , gaussianity ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the dark - matter halos , we can follow two different approaches : ( i ) extract the relevant information directly from the simulation or ( ii ) use a model for the lagrangian bias of the halos .",
    "the latter option offers a number of advantages .",
    "first , it allows us to make general predictions independently of the simulation specifics .",
    "second , it allows us to include halo bispectra in our formalism ( while it would be extremely demanding and time consuming to compute all possible triangular configurations from the simulation ) . for these reasons we will present below a model for the bias of the proto - haloes .",
    "note , however , that any lack of accuracy of the adopted lagrangian biasing scheme will propagate through the time evolution of our model and contribute to the imprecision of its final results .",
    "therefore , in order to test the accuracy of our evolutionary equations alone , we will also extract initial conditions directly from the simulation and compare the corresponding outcome of the evolution model with the statistics of the simulated haloes at @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider the overdensity of proto - haloes in lagrangian space @xmath76 and the corresponding mass - density fluctuation @xmath77 .",
    "we assume that their fourier transforms are linked by the expression : @xmath78 which corresponds to a non - local relation in real space .",

    "this is not surprising as @xcite have shown that most proto - haloes include a density peak of the corresponding mass scale within their lagrangian volume . in table",

    "whereas gaussianity is a good approximation for the linear matter distribution , fluctuations in the halo counts are non - gaussian even in the initial conditions .",
    "we can quantify their level of non - gaussianity in terms of their auto and cross bispectra that , using equation ( [ w ] ) , can all be reduced to one of the following forms : @xmath83 where the matter bispectrum @xmath84 is computed using the tree - level expression of the standard perturbation theory , @xmath85\\nonumber\\\\ & & p_{11}(k_1,z_{in})p_{11}(k_2,z_{in})+{\\rm cycl.}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 .",
    "+ in order to solve our evolutionary equations , we need to know also the linear velocity field of proto - haloes . in principle proto - haloes might not move with the same velocity as matter at the same location ( at the very least they should match the mass velocity smoothed on the lagrangian halo size ) .",
    "we model this effect assuming that proto - haloes are indeed related to linear density peaks which , as discussed above , gives a good description of their clustering properties .",
    "in particular we follow @xcite who proposed a model for the peak velocities , which in fourier space assumes the form _ h()=(1-k^2 ) e^-k^2r^2/2 _ m()b_v()_m ( ) , [ vbias ] with @xmath87 the scale - dependent `` velocity bias '' and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) being the spectral moments of the matter power spectrum defined as _ n^2 = _ 0^ kk^2(n+1)p_11(k)e^-k^2r^2 . in the equations above a gaussian smoothing window of size @xmath82 has been adopted to coarse grain the matter density and identify the peaks .",
    "once the proto - halo mass is linked to @xmath82 through @xmath90 ( with @xmath91 the mean comoving density of matter ) , this model has no free parameters , since the spectral moments are completely defined by @xmath92 .",

    "we note that the linear model severely overpredicts the two - time cross spectrum for @xmath158 .",

    "we include in @xmath159 the effect of the initial non - gaussianity of the halo field via its initial bispectra , computed as in eq .",

    "the vertical black dotted lines represent the limit up to which we expect our fluid approximation for the haloes to work .",
    "[ fig9 ]      the trg equations presented above are integrated numerically starting from the initial conditions discussed in section [ init ] . as a first step , we set all the initial bispectra to zero in figure [ fig3 ] we show a comparison between the halo - matter cross spectra extracted from the n - body simulation and the results of trg , one - loop and linear theory . in the first three bins , corresponding to lower halo masses , linear theory overpredicts the power on mildly non - linear scales ;",
    "note that this departure arises on larger scales compared to the matter auto spectrum ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the overprediction of linear theory is cured by the one - loop power spectrum only on very large scale , while the trg manages to correct it up to a smaller scale , before starting to fail .",
    "the fourth bin , though , displays a different behaviour : linear theory lacks of power on small scales , and neither the 1-loop correction nor the trg are much more accurate .",
    "this might originate from the fact that very massive haloes are large and rare in the initial conditions , therefore less suited for the fluid approximation .",
    "moreover , they also display the strongest velocity bias , which we are neglecting in our current non - linear treatment .",
    "a more quantitative analysis is presented in figure [ fig5 ] , where we plot the ratios between the spectra from the simulation and the theoretical results .",
    "the trg gives a cross spectrum within @xmath162 accuracy at least up to @xmath163 ( barring bin 4 ) , while linear theory does so up to @xmath164 .",
    "+ as previously pointed out , however , the halo - density field is not gaussian at @xmath165 .",
    "we use expressions ( [ y ] ) to account for initial bispectra in the trg method ( they are not present in the linear theory and at 1-loop level ) .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] illustrates that this indeed produces a slight improvement in the agreement with the simulation .",
    "the correction resulting from the introduction of the initial bispectra turns out to be quite small .",
    "the reason is that their contribution to the final cross spectrum @xmath65 is suppressed . to understand why",

    "in the one - loop computation , the initial @xmath64 contributes to the final one with a  weight \" of @xmath166 , as it also happens in linear theory .",
    "the initial matter bispectrum @xmath167 , instead , has a weight of @xmath168 , so it is suppressed by a factor of @xmath109 .",
    "factor is replaced by the bispectrum . ]",
    "if we now consider the haloes , we have showed in ( [ n ] ) that there is a new decaying mode , responsible for the linear debiasing .",
    "this new mode , that involves only the halo field , carries an extra @xmath109 suppression factor .",
    "we can now rank the contributions to @xmath65 according to their relevance :    1 .",
    "@xmath64 2 .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath169 3 .",
    "@xmath79 , @xmath170 4 .",
    "@xmath171 5 .",
    "@xmath172 .",
    "each item is suppressed by a factor of @xmath109 with respect to the previous one .",
    "we can see that only @xmath167 has some relevance , while the other terms are highly suppressed .",
    "even if the reasoning was based on perturbation theory , it is valid also for trg , at a qualitative level .",
    "incidentally , the fact that @xmath64 is the most relevant contribution is another evidence of debiasing .",
    "+ we can now address the effect of the truncation we perform in the trg , namely considering the trispectrum @xmath173 .",
    "first of all , the matter trispectrum @xmath174 can be neglected in the range of scales under consideration , as one can conclude from the comparison between trg and simulations in @xcite . the contribution from initial mixed ( i.e. matter - halo ) or pure halo trispectra",
    "is furtherly suppressed with respect to @xmath174 by extra @xmath109 factors , for the same reason as above .",
    "however , the trispectrum has its own time evolution as well , and one might argue that it becomes more relevant for @xmath175 ; this seems to be not the case , because enlarging the trg truncation scheme by including the running of the trispectrum gives a contribution to the power spectrum which is at least of two - loop order and it is certainly subdominant in the scales we are considering .",
    "+ from section 5 onward , we neglected any velocity bias , since this approximation proved to be accurate enough at @xmath1 ( in linear theory ) . as a further check , it is interesting to observe from figure [ fig4 ] that the trg is able to give a better prediction than full linear theory in eq .",
    "( [ vb ] ) , even neglecting the velocity bias that the linear theory accounts for .",
    "+    we can now look at the model predictions for the halo bias , defined as the ratio @xmath176 .",
    "this quantity is plotted as a function of wavenumber in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "while the linear - theory bias always increases with scale , irrespectively of halo mass , the trg result closely follows the scale dependence of @xmath11 seen in the simulation for the first two bins .",
    "it also gives a nearly constant bias for the third bin , as the simulation does , even though with a slightly lower value .",
    "however , the linear model performs better in the last bin where the bias in the simulation increases with @xmath133 .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the results displayed in a different way ; we can investigate the evolution of the cross spectrum from the initial conditions to today and the evolution of the bias as well . in figures",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we plot , respectively , @xmath177 again , our model is able to match accurately the trend of the simulation and to improve upon linear theory , excluding bin 4 .",
    "a key feature of the linear solution in eq . ( [ uff ] ) is the debiasing between halo and matter distributions with time .",
    "it is worth noting from figure [ fig8 ] that this effect is stronger for high - mass haloes , but constant on all the scales , while for low - mass haloes it is weaker on large scales and presents a strong @xmath133-dependence .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to modeling the clustering of dark - matter haloes on mildly non - linear scales .",
    "this follows the motion of the regions that will collapse to form haloes ( that we dub proto - haloes ) .",
    "since the number of proto - haloes is conserved over time , for sufficiently large scales ( @xmath178 ) , we can write a set of fluid equations that govern their evolution under the effect of gravity , which couples perturbations in the halo and matter density fields . we provide analytical solutions for the linearized equations and 1-loop perturbative corrections for the halo and matter power spectra . for the propagator , quantifying the memory of the density and velocity fields to their initial conditions , we also perform a resummation of perturbative corrections .",
    "finally , for the power spectrum we compute the non - linear evolution using a semi - analytical procedure , namely an extension of the time renormalization group .",
    "the initial conditions for our evolutionary equations are specified adopting a lagrangian bias model , originally developed to describe the clustering and motion of linear density peaks .",
    "we fix the parameters of the model so that to reproduce the distribution of proto - haloes in a high - resolution n - body simulation at @xmath179 .",
    "we use the same simulation to test the predictions of our model at @xmath1 .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * independently of the initial conditions , in the linear solution the halo density and velocity fields asymptotically match the corresponding matter fields at late times .",
    "this debiasing develops at a different rate for the density and the velocity , being faster for the latter .",
    "* even if there is no initial density bias , the presence of a velocity bias generates a transient density bias that vanishes at late times . *",
    "neglecting any initial velocity bias alters the linear predictions for the halo - matter cross spectrum at redshift @xmath1 only by less than 3 per cent , for @xmath180 .",
    "this provides us with the motivation to ignore the velocity bias in the non - linear analysis .",
    "* unlike its linear counterpart , the resummed propagator is in good agreement with the n - body simulation , independently of halo mass . *",
    "the halo - matter cross spectrum predicted by the trg is accurate to @xmath2 per cent up to @xmath181 for a broad range of halo masses .",
    "this does not hold for very massive haloes ( @xmath182 ) , that have low number density and high initial velocity bias , for which discreteness effects are more important . * the trg result improves upon both linear theory and 1-loop corrections . its performance is slightly enhanced accounting for the initial non - gaussianity of the halo distribution . * for low halo masses",

    "<S> we address the issue of the cosmological bias between matter and galaxy distributions , looking at dark - matter haloes as a first step to characterize galaxy clustering . starting from the linear density field at high redshift , we follow the centre of mass trajectory of the material that will form each halo at late times ( proto - halo ) . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a fluid - like description for the evolution of perturbations in the proto - halo distribution , which is coupled to the matter density field via gravity . </S>",
