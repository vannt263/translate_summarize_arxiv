    "the study of open and hidden charm production in high energy proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions can be an important probe of gluon saturation .",
    "indeed , the measurement of these processes allows to reach very small @xmath2 values where saturation effects should be enhanced .",
    "such measurements have been performed at the lhc , in particular by the alice and lhcb collaborations . on the theoretical point of view",
    ", the charm quark mass should be large enough to provide a hard scale , allowing the use of perturbative techniques , but still small enough to be sensitive to gluon saturation .",
    "here we will study the nuclear modification of @xmath3 and @xmath1 meson production in minimum bias collisions at the lhc ( we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for more detailed studies ) . for this",
    "we will use the dilute - dense limit of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework , since forward particle production probes the projectile at rather large @xmath2 and the target at very small @xmath2 . in this approach ,",
    "the physical representation of the process is that of a collinear gluon emitted by the the projectile proton which can split into a @xmath4 pair either before or after scattering off the target .",
    "the gluon or @xmath4 pair propagating in the target is then assumed to interact eikonally with it , picking up either an adjoint or fundamental wilson line factor depending on the particle .",
    "this process can then be described in terms of the same wilson line correlators which appear in other processes , such as ( inclusive and diffractive ) dis , single and double inclusive hadron production in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions and the initial state for the hydrodynamical modeling of heavy ion collisions .",
    "this framework can thus be applied to a broad range of processes .    the nuclear modification of @xmath3 and @xmath1 meson production has been studied in this formalism in the past  @xcite .",
    "however it was observed later at the lhc that the nuclear suppression of forward @xmath3 production was significantly smaller than the one predicted by this calculation .",
    "here we study these processes using the same `` hybrid '' framework , but with a more careful treatment of nuclear geometry when going from a proton to a nucleus target .",
    "our main motivation is that it was shown  @xcite that nuclear geometry effects can explain the disagreement between early cgc calculations  @xcite and lhc data in single inclusive hadron production .",
    "in this work we will focus on the nuclear modification factor , in which normalization uncertainties cancel .",
    "this ratio is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the cross sections in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions respectively .",
    "the key quantity needed to obtain the cross sections for @xmath3 and @xmath1 meson production in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions is the cross section for @xmath4 pair production .",
    "gluon and quark pair production has been studied in great detail in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .  @xcite ) and applied to various processes , such as  @xcite .",
    "we use the collinear approximation for the projectile proton since we consider forward rapidities , where it is probed at rather large @xmath2 .",
    "we will use the mstw 2008  @xcite lo parametrization for this . in this approximation",
    ", the @xmath4 pair production cross section reads , in the large-@xmath8 limit  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the transverse momenta of the quarks , @xmath12 and @xmath13 their rapidities , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the expression for @xmath16",
    "is given in ref .",
    "the function @xmath17 , which describes the propagation of the @xmath4 pair in the color field of the target , reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the impact parameter . here",
    "@xmath20 is the fourier transform of the fundamental representation dipole correlator @xmath21 of the target , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a wilson line in the fundamental representation .    in this work @xmath21",
    "is obtained by solving numerically the running coupling balitsky - kovchegov equation  @xcite . the initial condition for the evolution involves non - perturbative dynamics and can be fitted to data . in the case of a proton target",
    "we use the mv@xmath24 parametrization introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : at the initial rapidity , we have @xmath25 , \\ ] ] with @xmath26 .",
    "the running coupling in coordinate space is @xmath27 a fit to hera dis data  @xcite at @xmath28 gev@xmath29 and @xmath30 leads to @xmath31 gev@xmath29 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 mb  @xcite . in this model",
    "there is no impact - parameter dependence in the case of a proton target and @xmath35 corresponds to the effective transverse area of the proton .",
    "therefore when computing proton - proton cross sections we make the replacement @xmath36 in  ( [ eq : defphi ] ) .",
    "because of the lack of nuclear dis data in a kinematical domain similar to the one explored in  @xcite , this procedure can not be applied when the target is a nucleus . in refs .",
    "@xcite the initial condition for the bk evolution of the nucleus was taken of the same form as for a proton but with an initial saturation scale scaled by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "instead , in this work we use the optical glauber model . in this model",
    ", the initial condition for a nucleus reads  @xcite @xmath38 \\ ; , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the standard transverse thickness function given by @xmath40 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the constant @xmath43 is fixed so that the distribution is normalized to 1 .",
    "the other parameters in  ( [ eq : ica ] ) take the same values as in  ( [ eq : icp ] ) .",
    "therefore the standard nuclear transverse thickness function @xmath39 is the only new quantity introduced in the case of a nucleus target . to compute proton - nucleus cross sections",
    "we compute the yield at fixed impact parameters and integrate explicitly over @xmath19 in  ( [ eq : defphi ] ) .",
    "a problem with this approach is that at large impact parameters the saturation scale of the nucleus becomes too small for our formalism to be applicable",
    ". therefore we impose @xmath44 in the region where the saturation scale of the nucleus would be smaller than the one of the proton .",
    "this approach was first applied to single inclusive hadron production in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown to lead to values of the nuclear modification factor going to unity at large transverse momentum and compatible with lhc data .",
    "to obtain the @xmath0 production cross section from the @xmath4 pair production cross section  ( [ eq : dsigmaccbarcoll ] ) , we use here the simple color evaporation model ( cem ) . a more rigorous way to treat hadronization could be to rely on non - relativistic qcd , as done in ref .  @xcite . in the cem , we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the invariant mass of the quark - antiquark pair and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the charm quark and the @xmath1 meson mass , respectively . in the following we take @xmath49 gev and we vary @xmath47 between 1.2 and 1.5 gev .",
    "@xmath50 is a non - perturbative constant related to the probability for a @xmath4 pair with an invariant mass lower than @xmath51 to hadronize into a @xmath0 meson and it cancels in the nuclear modification factor , therefore its exact value is not important here .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : rpa_y_jpsi ] and  [ fig : rpa_pt_jpsi ] we show the nuclear modification factor for @xmath3 production at @xmath52  tev as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "the uncertainty band contains the variation of @xmath47 between 1.2 and 1.5 gev and of the factorization scale @xmath55 between @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "we see that our results are in much better agreement with alice and lhcb data than those shown in ref .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that the initial saturation scale for the lead nucleus in our approach is significantly smaller than the simple scaling by @xmath59 compared to a proton .",
