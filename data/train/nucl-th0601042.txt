    "the fusion of massive nuclei is currently a very hot topic in nuclear physics motivated by the search for new superheavy elements ( she ) @xcite .",
    "although the periodic table of the nuclei has been successfully extended during the past few years by the experimental discovery of new she @xcite , the understanding of the formation mechanism of these nuclei is still a challenge for theory .",
    "very recent experiments @xcite at lbnl in berkeley ( usa ) with @xmath1ca + @xmath2u have not confirmed the production of the @xmath3112 she reported by the dubna group ( russia ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the fusion of light and medium mass systems , where the fusion cross sections are determined by overcoming or tunnelling through the external coulomb barrier of the nucleus - nucleus potential ( @xmath4 which is rather well understood within the coupled channels framework , e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) , the fusion cross section for heavy systems can be inhibited by many orders of magnitude ( fusion hindrance @xcite ) due to the competition between fusion and quasi - fission ( reseparation before compound nucleus ( cn ) formation ) after the capture stage .",
    "the understanding of this competition remains an unsolved problem and is important for optimization of the she production rate as well as for understanding the new experimental results on fusion of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "in addition to the capture process and the subsequent evolution of the combined system from the contact configuration into the cn ( @xmath5 ) , the cooling process of the excited cn by the emission of light particles and gamma rays in competition with fission ( @xmath6 ) clearly affects the formation of the evaporation residues ( er ) observed in the experiments .",
    "the survival against fission is optimized by minimizing the cn excitation energy and angular momentum .",
    "this process is broadly described within a statistical decay model of atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that all nuclear degrees of freedom are equilibrated after the formation of the cn and before it begins to decay . for an overview of the three stages of a heavy ion fusion reaction leading to the formation of a heavy er",
    ", we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical groups involved in she research have a similar viewpoint regarding the description of the capture stage and the deexcitation process , but there is no consensus @xcite on the modelling of the intermediate stage of cn formation .",
    "the physics of the current theories sometimes contradict each other .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , most of them assume that the fusing system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "depending on the main coordinate for fusion , two sorts of models can be distinguished :    * in the first type @xcite , the fusion occurs in practice essentially along the radial coordinate using either adiabatic potential energy surface ( pes ) obtained with strutinsky s macroscopic - microscopic method @xcite and semi - empirical approaches @xcite or a liquid drop pes @xcite . the competition between fusion and quasi - fission caused by the effect of the thermal fluctuactions",
    "has only been included in recent models of this type , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the theory in @xcite is completely static .",
    "it only predicts the so - called cold fusion valleys in the pes that are formed with target - projectile combinations of closed shell nuclei . a large number of these combinations were succesfully used at gsi ( germany ) to synthesize she by cold fusion reactions . the macroscopic dynamical models @xcite are classical ones based on the concept of mean trajectory which is affected by the pes , the inertia and friction tensors as well as by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the theory of langevin trajectories @xcite is quite appealing , but it neglects important quantum effects ( quantum fluctuations , ground - state shell effects , diabatic effects ) and many of its ingredients are obtained in a rather uncertain manner , e.g. , hydrodynamical inertia and friction tensors as well as the pes which , in the best situations @xcite , is calculated with a two - center shell model ( tcsm ) @xcite that is inappropriate for compact nuclear shapes in very asymmetric reactions .",
    "of course , the experimental data are not always explained .",
    "a generalized langevin approach including quantum fluctuations has been proposed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . * in the second type @xcite ( dinuclear system ( dns ) model ) , the fusion happens only in the mass asymmetry coordinate @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mass numbers of the nuclei .",
    "the dns nuclei remain at the contact configuration and exchange nucleons until either all nucleons have been transferred from the lighter to the heavier fragment ( complete fusion ) , or the dns decays before the cn formation ( quasi - fission ) .",
    "the model assumes a sudden ( double - folding in frozen density approximation ) pes in the radial coordinate , while the pes behaves adiabatically along the fusion path in the @xmath10 coordinate .",
    "thus the theory avoids including the complex physics for large overlapping nuclei .",
    "the model is also attractive due to its simplicity and because its ingredients are obtained in a clearer manner ( defined in terms of the properties of the individual fragments forming the dns ) .",
    "although it has been successfully used to explain many experimental er cross sections , its theoretical foundation ( e.g. , the peculiarity of the pes ) is not clear enough yet .",
    "possible reasons for this could be the diabatic effects @xcite and large values of the microscopical mass parameter with respect to the neck degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the motivations for this work have been ( i ) to reconcile these conflicting theories , and ( ii ) to incorporate the _ multi - particle quantum nature _ of the fusing system , rather than assuming a continuous macroscopic fluid .",
    "the present paper is aimed at investigating the intermediate stage of cn formation and , in particular , the competition between fusion and quasi - fission . in this study",
    "we give a quantum - statistical formulation of the problem , which can be considered as the theoretical foundation of the exploratory calculations performed in refs .",
    "the study is based on the following general ideas ( which are well established but have up to now not been used in combination in any of the current models of fusion ) : ( i ) once the two nuclei are at the contact point , the system moves in a multidimensional space of collective coordinates , ( ii ) this motion is governed by a master equation , and ( iii ) the nature of the single - particle ( sp ) motion is time - dependent , it is initially diabatic and then approaches the adiabatic limit due to residual two - body collisions . as a result of ( iii )",
    ", the system moves in a time - dependent ( dynamical ) collective pes which is initially diabatic and gradually becomes adiabatic .",
    "moreover , the system does not adopt a single ( well - defined ) shape , but as a result of quantum and thermal fluctuactions a probability distribution of the nuclear shapes @xcite can be expected on the dynamical pes .",
    "the fusion is described as a statistically non - equilibrated evolution process of nuclear shapes , in which each shape evolves towards the thermal equilibrium .",
    "in addition to the diabatic effects and thermal fluctuations already treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we now include the effect of quantum fluctuations as well as rotation of the combined system on the shape fluctuations .",
    "the microscopic ingredients of the theory are obtained with a realistic tcsm based on woods - saxon potentials recently suggested in ref .",
    "one of the merits of this tcsm is that it permits studying very mass - asymmetric reactions .",
    "the present theory is unique and more realistic than the current fusion theories because it is founded on microscopical grounds and also for the first time incorporates a wide range of physical effects that crucially influence the formation of the heaviest compound nuclei .",
    "the diabatic sp motion arises from the coherent character of the coupling between the intrinsic and collective degrees of freedom whilst the dissipation is caused by the residual two - body collisions @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic limit refers to the case when the occupation of the sp energy levels obeys an equilibrated fermi - distribution with a finite temperature . at the diabatic limit @xcite ( elastic nuclear matter )",
    ", the nucleons do not always occupy the lowest free sp energy levels as in the adiabatic case ( plastic nuclear matter ) , but remain in the diabatic states during collective motion of the system .",
    "1 illustrates this situation .",
    "in other words , the probability for landau - zener promotion of the nucleons at the avoided crossings of adiabatic sp levels is close to one .",
    "this approach is realistic in the approach phase of collisions near the coulomb barrier where the total excitation energy per nucleon @xmath11 mev @xcite .",
    "this has been supported by time - dependent hartree - fock calculations @xcite . during the transition from the diabatic to the adiabatic limit",
    ", the nuclear matter is elastoplastic like glycerine .",
    "possible indications of the diabatic sp motion can be extracted from the pre - compound emission of fast particles @xcite and gamma rays @xcite as well as from the intrinsic excitation energy per nucleon of two quasi - fission fragments",
    "@xcite which is expected to be different for each fragment , i.e. , the fragments would have different temperatures .",
    "experimental evidence to support the point of view of a quantum - statistical description of the competition between fusion and quasi - fission can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "experiments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite show that ( i ) for a given target - projectile combination in the entrance channel many complex exit channels , involving large mass and charge transfers , develop after the passage ( inside ) of the coulomb barrier , and ( ii ) those complex exit channels reveal that the fragments have different temperatures , i.e. , the system is not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the experimental study in ref .",
    "@xcite clearly indicates that the formation of the cn occurs in a thermally non - equilibrated process which depends on the entrance channel .    in section 2 we will present the theoretical formalism in the following order : ( i )",
    "the master equation for the evolution of the nuclear shapes is re - derived with both the coarse - graining procedure used by nrenberg in ref .",
    "@xcite and methods of the non - equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics @xcite , ( ii ) the transition probability between the nuclear shapes is discussed , ( iii ) a model of treating the quantum and thermal effects on the shape fluctuations is proposed , and ( iv ) a realistic model of calculating the probability distribution of the nuclear shapes along with the probability for cn formation and quasi - fission is suggested .",
    "the calculation of other possible @xmath12 like the mass distribution of the quasi - fission fragments as well as the average total and intrinsic excitation energy of the cn is finally discussed .",
    "here observables mean theoretical quantities that may be verified by direct experiments .",
    "of course , the experimental data may contain contributions of many effects that our theory does not include yet .",
    "for instance , the experimental mass yield in fusion - fission reactions includes the contribution of fission events , in addition to what we define here as quasi - fission .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our theoretical mass distribution does not include the fission component ( decay of the cn into two fragments ) , but is limited to all the binary fragmentations which occur after capture and before the cn formation .",
    "this is exactly what we call quasi - fission .",
    "the separation between the stage of formation of the cn and its fission is justified if the fission time scale is much larger than the formation time of the cn , which is supported by experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "numerical results for heavy - ion reactions leading to the @xmath0no compound nucleus are shown and discussed .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "the present theory aims at describing the competition between fusion and quasi - fission after capture of the interacting nuclei , translated to a problem of diffusion of nuclear shapes through the multi - dimensional _ dynamical _ collective potential energy landscape . to my knowledge",
    ", there are no experimental observations so far , which rule out this scenario . the theory is essentially based on the single - particle model .",
    "this may explain and predict the dependence of fusion , after contact of the nuclei , on the shell structure of the interacting nuclei .",
    "owing to the statistical nature of this approach , there is no equation of motion for individual collective coordinates .",
    "the theory only describes the evolution in time of an ensemble of nuclear shapes ( parametrically defined by a set of collective coordinates ) that develop following contact of the interacting nuclei .",
    "the basic macroscopic variable will be the nuclear shape , which determines the two - center mean - field in which the nucleons are moving .",
    "after capture of the nuclei , the motion of the compact fusing system is expected to be slow ( overdamped ) , as the initial diabatic collective pes practically equalizes the total incident energy of the system ( small kinetic energy ) .",
    "the usual concept of collective inertia and forces do not appear in the theory explicitly , because the concept of classical trajectory is not applied .",
    "effects similar to the collective inertial effects may be included in the local transition probability rate between the nuclear shapes .",
    "this transition probability rate clearly incorporates quantum and thermal effects which drive shape fluctuations .    the master equation describing the evolution of the nuclear shapes",
    "is obtained using the time - dependent tcsm representation .",
    "the two - body residual interactions are responsible for the change of the occupation numbers of the two - center sp orbitals that define the set of many - body channel wave - functions ( slater determinants ) .",
    "the coupling between channels belonging to the same nuclear shape is assumed to be much stronger than the coupling between channels of different nuclear shapes . as a consequence , the markov limit of the master equation",
    "is obtained .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that the evolution in time of the compact nuclear shapes is slow .",
    "the phrase _ thermal equilibrium _ ( local ) will only refer to the situation when the occupation numbers of the sp orbits at a given nuclear shape obey a fermi distribution for a finite temperature .",
    "following capture , due to diabatic effects in the entrance phase of the reaction , the sp occupations can be strongly deviated from the fermi distribution ( there is no thermal equilibrium in the system and , strictly speaking , the concept of temperature is meaningless ) .",
    "diabaticity only produces coherent particle - hole ( ph ) excitations that contribute to the collective pes .",
    "the two - body residual interactions gradually destroy these coherent ph excitations , i.e. , the system heats up and the sp occupation numbers evolve in time towards a fermi distribution for a finite temperature .",
    "the evolution in time of the nuclear shapes ( a non - equilibrated macroscopic process ) occurs in conjunction with the thermalization of each nuclear shape .",
    "this scenario will be modelled solving the master equation coupled to the relaxation equation for the sp occupation numbers .",
    "we will not include nucleons evaporation .",
    "it is important to say that we can not distinguish between coherent and incoherent ph excitations during the relaxation of the sp occupation numbers . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the initial coherent ph excitations turns into incoherent ones ( heat ) when the thermal equilibrium is reached , i.e. , collective modes like surface vibrations of a given nuclear shape are completely damped .",
    "the total many - body wave - function @xmath13 of the fusing system is expanded in terms of a set of many - body @xmath14 @xmath15 as follows    @xmath16    which satisfies the time - dependent schrdinger equation    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the total many - body hamiltonian .",
