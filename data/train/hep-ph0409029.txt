    "the publication of the seminal papers by greisen and zatsepin & kuzmin  @xcite predicting the energy attenuation of protons overs tens of megaparsecs due to interactions with cmb photons ( gzk effect ) , together with the observation of cosmic ray airshowers with inferred energies of @xmath1 ev , has created a vigorously pursued area of particle astrophysics .",
    "in fact , as of 2004 there are many more papers proposing explanations for the existence of these trans - gzk airshowers than there are recorded events ! due to this relatively sparse sample of events , open questions include the existence of statistically significant clustering / anisotropy , correlations with known astrophysical source distributions ( e.g. , qsos ) , the composition / charge of the primaries , and whether the production mechanism is top - down or bottom - up .",
    "the present paper , delivered at the 2004 cosmic ray international seminar ( cris 2004 ) , summarizes a bottom - up scenario whereby the primary incident on the earth s atmosphere is a neutral , non - hadronic particle such as a neutrino that generates a hadron - like airshower due to the primary interaction being above a low - scale unification threshold .",
    "further details concerning the theoretical considerations sketched here , additional figures and tables , and more complete bibliographies can be found in the referenced papers .",
    "if trans - gzk events originate from sources farther away than @xmath2  mpc , the most likely candidate for the primary is some type of neutral particle .",
    "a standard model neutrino can propagate over cosmological distances with little energy loss , but , of course , the interaction cross - section @xmath3 is several orders of magnitude too low to generate the observed showers .",
    "however , it has been conjectured for some time that perhaps a `` strongly interacting neutrino '' could exist due to some as yet undiscovered `` new physics '' , and thus possess the required interaction strength at the appropriate cm energies  @xcite . with the realization that higher - dimensional string theories may allow interaction unification at energies many orders below the standard 4-dimensional planck scale of @xmath4  @xcite ,",
    "interest in the strongly interacting neutrino picture has been revived , and has resulted in new work involving rigorous theoretical considerations within the framework of a specific model  @xcite .",
    "additional features relative to cosmic ray airshowers have been extracted , although ongoing work continues to refine the predictions relative to conventional airshower observables  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , if the cm energy of the neutrino - nucleon is above a `` low energy '' unification scale , the neutrino - quark interaction is `` strong '' , and a leptoquark resonant state can form , @xmath5 . in establishing model properties using the phenomenology of higher - dimensional string theories , it is worth noting that `` typical '' tree level amplitudes for strings yield a cross section that is too small to account for the trans - gzk events  @xcite .",
    "this does not rule out the present model , but does emphasize that weakly - coupled string theories are inadequate here , and one must calculate with the strongly - coupled theory ( and non - perturbatively when possible ) .",
    "this is analogous to attempting to calculate quark interactions using qcd .",
    "the basic building blocks of the model are unitarity of the s - matrix , a rapidly ( exponentially ) rising level density of resonances , unification of interactions with strength @xmath6 standard model strong interaction at string scale @xmath7 , and duality of resonances in a given channel with regge exchanges in crossed channels .",
    "express the total cross section in terms of partial waves and absorption coefficients using the optical theorem , @xmath8 note that as @xmath9 increases , the resonances are no longer purely elastic with absorption slowing the growth of the total cross section , and where @xmath10 is the resonance level and equals the maximum angular momentum ; ignoring corrections @xmath11 , @xmath12 tends to a constant value .",
    "the level density of resonances is well represented for the first few resonances by @xmath13      a connection between string theories and quantum black holes is not a new idea , and there is notable recent work in this area  @xcite . extending this to the case of interest here , domokos & kovesi - domokos",
    "have demonstrated a non - perturbative equivalence of the string excitation model with that of quantum `` mini black holes ''  @xcite .",
    "the treatment in reference  @xcite is based on a statistical mechanical analysis of the previously introduced string model beginning with consideration of the microcanonical density matrix of the final state , @xmath14 a straightforward manipulation yields the standard passge to the canonical ensemble with well - defined entropy @xmath15 and a temperature that asymptotically approaches the hagedorn temperature , @xmath16 .",
    "recall that in modern qcd , the hagedorn temperature @xmath17 is interpreted as marking the deconfining phase transition from the low temperature hadron phase ( quark confinement ) to the quark - gluon plasma . in terms of modern quantum gravity and string theory ,",
    "the entropy of a @xmath18-dimensional quantum black hole ( qbh ) equals the string entropy @xmath15 at @xmath19 .",
    "it is straightforward to derive additional relations between @xmath15 , @xmath7 , @xmath17 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the asymptotic estimate then has important consequences in allowing a non - perturbative calculation of the single particle inclusive distribution similar to the statistical mechanical analysis carried out at the tree level for specific string models by amati & russo ( 1999 ) .",
    "naturally , calculated quantities are a function of the number of `` extra '' dimensions in the model ( i.e. , the number of dimensions in addition to the conventional 4-dim space - time ) .",
    "depending on model choices for characteristic scales , the resulting multiplicities can be similar to those expected in reactions initiated by a heavy nucleus  @xcite .      because the string - qbh model must contain resonances with the number of states an exponentially growing function of the resonance mass",
    ", there is a ( nearly ) @xmath21-fcn transition from the sm to the unified regime .",
    "however , there is obviously no exact @xmath21-fcn transition in nature , thus implying that there must exist a finite width transition region . with no analytic solution describing this transition available from the physics , we choose to treat it empirically by adopting a convenient mathematical smoothing function to represent the neutrino quark cross section .",
    "nevertheless , the chosen form exhibits the desirable physical characteristics of nearly step - function behavior saturating at a tbd strong interaction strength while remaining continuous and without violating unitarity , @xmath22 in the above , the conversion from the lab frame to the cm frame is via @xmath23 , and @xmath24 such that at @xmath25 we have @xmath26 .",
    "the choices of @xmath27 and @xmath28 determine the value of @xmath29 , taken here to be @xmath30  mb .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure  [ smooth_fcn ] for a string scale @xmath31 tev .",
    "of course , the neutrino - quark cross section must be integrated over the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the participating partons in the nucleon to arrive at the final ( observed ) quark - nucleon cross section , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and momentum fraction @xmath34 .",
    "the integration is over valence quarks only since there are no leptogluons in current string models , and the sea quarks contribute primarily around @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ int_pdf ] shows the result of integrating the @xmath36 of figure  [ smooth_fcn ] using the cteq6 pdfs .",
    "there is a region where the cross section would give rise to deep showers , and this is indicated ( approximately ) by the dashed lines in the figure ( this is further discussed below ) .",
    "thus , as developed in the previous section , the strength and properties of the unified interaction can lead to a hadron - like airshower initiated by a specific neutral string / qbh state ( here taken to be a neutrino ) , but with some potentially observable differences compared to those generated by hadrons or nuclei .",
    "we study the generated airshower properties using the adaptive longitudinal profile shower ( alps ) simulation originally created by p. mikulski  @xcite .",
    "alps is similar to other hybrid simulations that use subshower parameterization instead of tracking every individual particle .",
    "its performance is comparable to corsika - qgsjet and the bartol - qgsjet hybrid simulation , as shown in figure  [ xmax_comp ] for average @xmath37 values generated by proton primaries as a function of primary energy .",
    "similar results hold for @xmath38 values .",
    "values generated by alps , corsika - qgsjet , and the bartol - qgsjet simulations for proton primaries .",
    "the error bars shown are from alps . ]",
    "ev protons and ( strongly interacting ) neutrinos . ]     ev protons and ( strongly interacting ) neutrinos and @xmath39 ev neutrinos . the higher energy neutrino events ( ` + ' symbols ) populate essentially the same region as the proton events ( o symbols ) , and are not easily distinguished in this plot . ]    using the same string model parameters leading to figures [ smooth_fcn ] and [ int_pdf ] , figure  [ alps_comp1 ] presents alps results showing that , in general , a proton will produce more electrons in a given airshower than a strongly interacting neutrino of the same energy although the depth at maximum electron production is quite similar .",
    "the reason for the @xmath38 difference is that a larger number of prompt leptons ( mostly muons ) are produced by the neutrino .",
    "however , from figure  [ alps_comp2 ] , it is also seen that a @xmath39 ev neutrino has both the approximately same @xmath37 and @xmath38 distributions as the @xmath40 ev proton , so that it would be virtually impossible to distinguish airshowers generated by one or the other . in these cases , an additional airshower observable such as muon number",
    "is required . still , since it is expected that sources possess a non - monoenergetic injection spectrum , over a large number of observed events with different primary energies",
    ", the best discriminator may be identification of a specific source candidate since the source distance can eliminate protons as candidate primaries .     and @xmath41 in the sm @xmath42 unified transition region for a 70 tev string scale .",
    "]    another possible discrimination technique is the observation of highly inclined or nearly horizontal airshowers since the expected width of the sm @xmath42 unified transition region should produce an excess of observed showers relative to that expected from protons alone .",
    "predictions ( extrapolations ) for how @xmath37 and @xmath41 scale with the changing cross section in the transition region are shown in figure  [ alps_x ] . also note that the fluctuations around the mean values shown in figure  [ alps_x ] also increase very rapidly with decreasing cross section .",
    "the interesting point here is that an observed flux of inclined showers can be used to directly constrain the string scale , and , depending on the model favored by nature , this may be the _ only _ way to do this in the next decade ( or beyond ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the idea that mini black holes might be produced in extra - dimensional theories with energy scales orders of magnitude lower than the planck scale has been explored previously by several authors  @xcite .",
    "however , the model presented here differs in several important aspects : +   +   +   + currently , experimental results do not rule out the model discussed here , tev - scale gravity models , or many other competitors . however , the next generation detectors , especially auger and ashra , that are nearing completion are quite capable of discrminating among the possibilities .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a detailed analysis of the agasa data appears to indicate that the highest energy cosmic rays with @xmath0 ev may be distributed on the sky differently than those having energies @xmath43 ev , and this may support the idea that the highest energy airshower events are generated by neutral particles that have propagated distances in excess of 100 mpc  @xcite . the main difficulty with such a scenario is that , at this time , it is difficult to understand how a @xmath1 ev neutrino is produced without first generating a @xmath44 ev hadron , and it is simply not known if such an astrophysical engine exists .",
    "however , it is probably too soon to say with absolute certainty that such sources can not exist .    finally , we summarize the main points presented here .",
    "our work is continuing in both the theoretical and the simulation areas , and will be reported in future papers .",
    "the robust features of the string / qbh phenomenology developed up to now include the following : +   +   +   +   + the model also yields a natural way to include an additional component in the ehecr distribution if protons , pions , and neutrinos are produced in astrophysical engines with proton propagation limited by the gzk effect , but with neutrinos able to propagate over cosmological distances .",
