    "the apparent optical depth ( aod ) method @xcite has gained substantial popularity as a means of converting velocity - resolved flux profiles into column density measurements for interstellar and intergalactic absorption lines .",
    "the method offers a quick and convenient way of determining reliable interstellar column densities from unsaturated lines without having to follow a full curve - of - growth analysis or detailed component fit , and without demanding prior knowledge of the component structure .",
    "accurate column densities are important for studies of elemental abundances and physical conditions in diffuse gas in space .    in the aod method , a velocity - resolved flux profile @xmath1 is converted to an apparent optical depth profile @xmath2 using the relation : @xmath3,\\ ] ] where and @xmath1 and @xmath4 are the observed line and continuum fluxes at velocity @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "this apparent optical depth profile can then be converted to an apparent column density profile according to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the oscillator strength of the transition and @xmath8 is the transition wavelength in angstroms @xcite . the total apparent column density between two velocity limits @xmath9 and @xmath10 is then simply @xmath11 . when two lines of different strength of the same ionic species are available , the aod method can also be used to assess and correct for the level of saturation in the data , by comparing the apparent column density derived from the stronger line with that derived from the weaker line @xcite .",
    "the aod method was originally developed for application to measurements of reasonably high signal - to - noise spectra ( s / n@xmath020 per resolution element ) .",
    "the technique offers excellent results in these cases .",
    "however , spectroscopists are now using the method even when analyzing relatively low s",
    "/ n data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this paper deals with accounting for a systematic error that is introduced when applying the aod method to noisy data , which can lead to an overestimation of the true column density of the absorbing species . the error arises because the logarithmic relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( eq .",
    "1 ) will distort a poisson noise component in the flux when converting into column density space , giving undue weight to the pixels where the noise has resulted in high optical depths ; this effect tends to exaggerate the estimate of @xmath12 .",
    "we present simulations investigating the accuracy of @xmath12 determinations as a function of line depth and s / n , together with the separate effects of line width and rebinning .",
    "we ran monte carlo simulations of the measurement of noisy absorption lines to investigate the amount by which noise in the data leads to overestimation of @xmath12 .",
    "our models were run with two simulated experimental setups , representing the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) lif @xcite and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) e140 m @xcite configurations .",
    "fuse_/lif setup is parameterized by a gaussian instrumental line spread function with fwhm=20kms@xmath13(@xmath14kms@xmath13 ) and velocity pixels 2.0kms@xmath13  wide .",
    "the stis / e140 m configuration has fwhm=6.8kms@xmath13  ( @xmath15kms@xmath13 ) and 3.2kms@xmath13  pixels .",
    "our models simulate the measurement of an absorption line whose intrinsic optical depth profile is a single - component gaussian , centered for convenience at 0kms@xmath13 , and normalized to a peak optical depth of @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "we run models for two line width cases : resolved ( @xmath18 ) and marginally resolved ( @xmath19 ) the aod method is known to underestimate the column density for unresolved lines , when no allowance is made for the effects of unresolved saturation [ see table 5 of @xcite ] .    for a grid of different intrinsic central line depths",
    "@xmath20 we converted the optical depth profile to a normalized flux profile using @xmath21 , where the intrinsic central optical depth @xmath22 .",
    "the flux profiles were then convolved with the instrumental broadening function ; the effect of this process is to decrease the intrinsic line depth to an apparent line depth ( @xmath23 ) , and increase the intrinsic line width to an apparent line width ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we then added different levels of random noise ( drawn from a gaussian distibution ) to the data , scaled so that the s / n in the continuum reached the desired levels when rebinned to pixels equal in size to the resolution element . in the line , we scaled down the random noise contribution by @xmath25 , in accordance with poisson statistics .",
    "we then rebinned the data by different factors , converted the profiles to @xmath26 space , and finally integrated the profiles over velocity to yield @xmath12 , as a function of line depth , noise , and rebinning factor .",
    "the velocity integration limits used are @xmath27 around the line center , corresponding to the points where the line recovers to 96% of the continuum in the absence of noise .",
    "these limits were chosen so as to reproduce the velocity integration ranges used in practice , determined by comparing the line widths and velocity integration ranges from a large spectroscopic data set ( the _ fuse _   survey ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for each model run , we determined the ratio of @xmath12 to @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is the true column density of the simulated component , then repeated the process 500 times ; the mean overestimation factor @xmath29 , together with its dispersion , is then used in our results .    for very optically thick lines",
    ", the random error can take the flux below zero , corresponding to negative @xmath26 , which has no physical meaning .",
    "therefore , a cutoff must be used , whereby all points with @xmath1 less than some value are placed at that value ( in our case , 1% of the continuum ) .",
    "the cutoff value selected will depend on the reliability of the scattered light and background corrections for the particular instrument providing the observations .",
    "figure 1 shows a graphical example of the overestimation process for a resolved line with an intrinsic depth of 0.8 , measured with _",
    "fuse_. in the left column we show how the spectra would appear at different s",
    "/ n levels , ranging from s / n=@xmath30 at the bottom to s / n=5 at the top . note that we quote the s / n per resolution element , rather than the s / n at the level of rebinning shown .",
    "the two are related by ( s / n)@xmath31=@xmath32(number of bins per resolution element ) @xmath33(s / n)@xmath34 .",
    "we verified this relation by measuring the s / n of the model spectra at different binning levels . in the next three columns we show the profiles in apparent column density space after different levels of rebinning .",
    "in figure 2 we display the results of different parameter cases using a color - coded plot : resolved lines with _ fuse _",
    "( top left ) , marginally resolved lines with _ fuse_(top right ) , resolved lines with stis ( bottom left ) , and marginally resolved lines with stis ( bottom right ) . within each panel , we show the overestimation factor as a function of signal - to - noise ratio and apparent line depth ( both easily measurable quantities ) , for three different rebinning cases . in each panel , we have not shaded in regions that correspond to non - significant detections , i.e. those with @xmath35 ; the minimum depth line that can be considered significant is proportional to ( s / n)@xmath13 , since at low s / n shallow lines will not be distinguished from the noise . using figure 2",
    "an observer can find the likely error on @xmath12 in a line with a given depth , width , and s / n , and correct for it .",
    "the overestimation factors for a range of cases are also presented in tables 1 and 2 , for _ fuse_/lif and stis / e140 m data , respectively . upon request",
    "we can also provide an idl code that returns the overestimation factor when given the measured s / n , apparent line depth , and apparent line width .",
    "the effects of several parameters combine to produce the trends seen in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 : s / n , level of rebinning , spectral resolution , line width , and line depth .",
    "we discuss each separately in this section .    * * low s / n and rebinning *  the non - linear distortion of the @xmath26 profile and resulting overestimate of @xmath12 becomes worse as the s / n decreases ( fig .",
    "1 ) . rebinning the spectrum before measurement can lessen the distortion , since the rebinning process increases the effective s / n .",
    "once the data is rebinned to a level coarser than the resolution element , the gain in the @xmath12 accuracy is made at the expense of resolution , so that kinematic information is given up .",
    "however , if the absorption line before rebinning is fully or marginally resolved , and if one is more interested in obtaining an accurate column density than obtaining knowledge about the detailed shape of the line profile , then overbinning is justified at low s / n .",
    "aod measurements made at optimum sampling ( two rebinned pixels per resolution element ) on _ fuse _ and stis data are overestimated by less than 10% for s / n per resolution element @xmath07 . for data with lower s",
    "/ n , rebinning beyond the resolution element will likely increase the accuracy of the derived column density . * * lack of resolution and line width *  for marginally resolved lines , the apparent column density tends to underestimate the true column density at high line depths ( purple shading on the right hand panels in figure 2 ) , since the high optical depth points are smoothed out to lower apparent optical depths by the instrumental blurring .",
    "this effect therefore works in the opposite sense to the s / n effect .",
    "the more unresolved the line is ( i.e. , the lower @xmath36 ) , the worse this effect becomes .",
    "even full saturation can be hidden by the effects of instrumental broadening . @xcite and @xcite",
    "discuss how this unresolved saturation can be corrected for when observations exist for more than one line of an ion . for resolved lines , increasing the ratio @xmath36 above 2 increases the number of pixels susceptible to noise and",
    "hence increases @xmath37 slightly for a given s / n and line depth ( by a few percent if @xmath38 ) ; however , since the dependency on width is weak , we present results for two line width cases only . *",
    "* line depth *  for a given s / n and line width , the overestimation factor is worse for shallow lines than for deep lines .",
    "this is because the noise is poissonian , so a pixel with low optical depth ( shallow ) has a higher error on the flux than a pixel with high optical depth ( deep ) .",
    "for very deep lines , the cutoff used to eliminate negative pixels _ underestimates _ the optical depth in very opaque parts of the profile .",
    "this effect works in the opposite sense to the s / n effect , so that measurements of very deep ( @xmath39 ) lines at low s / n are distorted by two competing effects . note that if the noise were random rather than poissonian ( i.e. independent of the flux ) , the overestimation effect on deep lines would become worse since the flux errors deep in the lines are larger .    in figure 3",
    "we show the histogram of @xmath40 for one particular run ( _ fuse_/lif , @xmath18 , s / n=8 , intrinsic depth=0.5 , 500 runs ) for three levels of rebinning .",
    "the overestimation factor has a gaussian distribution , with a mean that decreases with rebinning . for any given absorption profile ,",
    "the overestimation can take a range of values .",
    "we therefore advise a conservative error estimate when correcting for the overestimation .",
    "we note that the non - linear s / n distortion effect discussed here can influence the detailed intercomparisons of @xmath26 profiles of the same ion .",
    "therefore , corrections for line saturation based on comparing @xmath26 profiles of weak and strong lines may not be valid for low s / n observations .    in their survey of absorption in the galactic halo and high - velocity clouds , @xcite rebinned _ fuse _  data with s / n@xmath4110 per resolution element by 5 pixels , and noisier data by up to 20 pixels , before measurement with the aod technique .",
    "our modelling shows that this was the correct procedure for measuring accurate column densities , and we endorse a similar treatment of low s / n data in future studies . without this rebinning ,",
    "the column density measurements along sight lines with noisy spectra could be inflated by more than 20% .",
