    "recent experiments at jila@xcite and subsequent analyses@xcite have demonstrated the identical spin rotation effect ( isre ) in the pseudo spin dynamics of trapped ultra - cold atoms with two internal states .",
    "the isre in spin - polarized quantum gases@xcite and analogous mean - field effects in liquid helium@xcite give rise to interesting behavior such as spin waves , instability against transverse fluctuations , and spontaneous formation of magnetic domains .",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that simulations of the appropriate kinetic equations with jila parameters reproduce the observed pseudo - spin wave oscillations .",
    "kuklov and meyerovich@xcite have noted that castaing instabilites@xcite and domain wall solutions should be present in trapped gases as well .",
    "recently , fuchs _",
    "et al._@xcite have investigated these instabilities by performing simulations of the kinetic equations with large initial longitudinal polarization gradients .",
    "although the castaing instability is washed out for low collision frequencies , they found that the stability should be observeable in trapped gases in , or near , the hydrodynamic regime .    in this paper , we restrict our attention to the hydrodynamic regime ( collision time @xmath1 ) where the equations of motion originally derived by leggett and rice@xcite ( lr ) for spin - polarized systems apply , and where the nonlinear dynamics are most evident . in the first part",
    ", we analyze the behavior of trapped systems with small linear and quadratic field inhomogenities , although the results are readily generalized for arbitrary field inhomogeneities ( and for finite @xmath2 , for that matter ) . in the second part",
    ", we carry out a numerical stability analysis of the longitudinal diffusion modes , and use computer simulations to study the formation of domain walls in jila - type @xmath0-pulse experiments .    for cigar - shaped traps situated along the z - axis the lr equations of motion reduce , in the larmor frame of the center of the trap , to @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the current density , @xmath7 is the linear ( @xmath8 ) or quadratic ( @xmath9 ) strength of the field inhomogeneity , @xmath10 is the spin diffusion coefficient , @xmath11 is the spin - rotation parameter , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the axial trap frequency .",
    "we do not take any polarization or density dependence of the transport coefficients into account .",
    "these equations can be put into dimensionless form by writing @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the equilibrium magnetization at the center of the trap . in",

    "the initial conditions are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "for small values of the parameter @xmath28 the system is in the bounded diffusion regime@xcite and the external field can be treated as a perturbation of the tipped equilibrium magnetization . in this case",
    "the field inhomogeneity gives rise to ( 1 ) transients after the @xmath0-pulse that oscillate at the zero - field spin - wave frequencies and ( 2 ) a slow decay of the magnetization .",
    "the linearized equation of motion is obtained by substituting @xmath29 , @xmath30 into eqs.([dmdtsp]-[jsp ] ) , giving @xmath31 where we have introduced the complex phase @xmath32 .    .",

    "1a - b , is obtained by setting @xmath44 and solving eq.([dpsi ] ) with the boundary conditions @xmath45 as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath48 the solutions are diffusive modes of alternating parity with @xmath49 . for larger values of @xmath50",
    "some modes of opposite parity coalesce into modes localized on the left or right of the trap .",
    "these modes decay rapidly , however , and are not excited by small fields .",
    "only the first two modes with eigenvalues @xmath51 and @xmath52 are appreciably excited .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified for large @xmath50 in which case the rhs of eq.([dpsi ] ) is sturm - liouville operator with kernel @xmath53 . to analyze the transients after a @xmath0 pulse",
    ", we write @xmath54 and dot eq.([dpsi ] ) with @xmath55 , giving @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "this has the solution @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "this solution is still valid for small damping with the replacement @xmath60 .",
    "after the transients the long - lived mode can be found from @xmath61 .",
    "alternatively , we set @xmath62 and @xmath63 in eq.([jsp ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath64 substituting this into eqs.([dmdtsp]-[jsp ] ) gives equations of motion for the long - lived mode that are identical to the @xmath48 case .",
    "these can be solved exactly,@xcite and for small @xmath65 give @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with @xmath53 decaying at a rate @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath37 profile is found by integrating eq.([dtheta ] ) and using @xmath70 . for linear and quadratic fields we get , respectively , @xmath71 @xmath72\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}z^{2}\\right ) } \\label{mzg2}\\ ] ] which are essentially identical to the @xmath33 and @xmath34 zero - field modes ( see fig . 1c . ) .",
    "we note that for small @xmath65 and large @xmath50 the largest corrections to the hydrodynamic results are @xmath73 ) .",
    "1d shows the evolution @xmath37 at the center of the trap , which is qualitatively similiar to the evolution for larger fields ( compare to fig . 1 in ref . where @xmath74 )",
    "for larger values of @xmath28 the the modes are strongly coupled and higher - orders are evident in the transients .",
    "even so , a linear analysis ( which we do not provide here ) involving the energy of the undamped modes correctly predicts @xmath76 for the number of orders observed in simulations ( see fig .",
    "also , for large @xmath28 we can treat the trap as a perturbation for short times , giving @xmath77 as the time for the boundary conditions to propagate to the center of the trap ( i.e. @xmath78 ) . before this time",
    "the magnetization at the center of the trap is effectively unbounded , and for large @xmath50 evolves according to @xmath79 , @xmath25 ( @xmath8 ) ; or @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( @xmath9 ) .    for large values of @xmath28 a @xmath0 pulse can result in the formation of a long - lived domains .",
    "these structures , which have been extensively studied in liquid helium,@xmath82 are formed as the z - component of the spin current @xmath83 drives the dipole ( k=1 ) or quadrapole ( k=2 ) longitudinal modes .     for @xmath84 and @xmath85 showing the higher - order transients and the formation of a domain wall .",
    "( b ) @xmath86 stability diagram .",
    "the small symbols show the results of the numerical stability analysis of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 longitudinal modes .",
    "the larger symbols indicate whether a domain wall forms ( black ) , or not(white ) , ( gray = marginal ) , in simulations of @xmath0-pulse experiments.,width=480 ]    as the transients decay , the transverse magnetization ( @xmath87 ) becomes confined near the zeroes of @xmath37 .",
    "normally , the field gradient dephases @xmath88 rapidly and @xmath37 decays via ordinary diffusion .",
    "however , if @xmath50 is large enough , the longitudinal spin current is unstable , and @xmath88 develops into coherent domain walls , dividing @xmath37 into two ( k=1 ) or three ( k=2 ) domains that decay via transverse diffusion across the domain walls . for large @xmath28",
    "the domain wall solution is given by@xcite @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is a zero of the z - magnetization given by @xmath93 .",
    "this description is valid so long as the width of the domain wall @xmath94 .    for large gradients",
    "the walls are destroyed for @xmath95 as found in ref . for uniform @xmath83 . to find the stability threshold for smaller fields",
    ", we performed a numerical stability analysis of the @xmath33 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath97 ) longitudinal modes against transverse perturbations .",
    "there is a complication that the longitudinal modes decay at rates @xmath49 . for a given @xmath65 , we defined the threshold of stability of the @xmath98th mode as the value of @xmath50 where the perturbations grow at the rate @xmath99 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "2b . determining the minimum @xmath50 for the formation of domain wall after a @xmath0 pulse is difficult because the magnetization decays in a rather complicated manner before",
    "the longitudinal modes are established .",
    "thus , we carried out simulations of @xmath0 pulse experiments for various values of @xmath50 and @xmath65 .",
    "the presence of a domain wall is signaled by its slow decay rate@xcite @xmath100 that is much slower than the longitudinal diffusion rate .",
    "the results , which are summarized in fig .",
    "2b , indicate that domains will not be observeable in quadratic ( or gaussian ) fields for @xmath101",
    ". however , for linear fields ( perhaps in optical traps ) domains should be observable for @xmath102 .",
    "recently , domains have been observed @xcite in normal trapped @xmath103rb , but since the lifetime of the domains was comparable to their formation time , the experiment corresponds to the ( @xmath34 ) marginal category in fig .",
