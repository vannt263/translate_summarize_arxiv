    "since the discovery of superconductivity in fese layered compound k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 @xcite , considerable attention was focused on iron selenide materials due to their relatively high superconducting transition temperatures ( @xmath10).@xcite recent investigations of single - layer fese films grown on srtio@xmath11 revealed superconductivity with @xmath10 above 100 k , which is the highest critical temperature among all iron based materials discovered so far.@xcite alkali metal - doped iron chalcogenides have some interesting features that distinguish them from the other iron based superconductors.@xcite angle resolved photoemission measurements showed that there are no hole pockets at the fermi level in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 , which opens the possibility of different type of pairing mechanism than in the iron pnictides .",
    "@xcite this is consistent with observed negative values of the hall constant @xmath12 in a temperature range 0 - 150 k @xcite , which implies that conduction is predominantly governed by electron - like carriers .",
    "the most striking feature of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystals is the presence of two distinct phases : insulating and metallic / superconducting .",
    "@xcite insulating phase has antiferromagnetically , @xmath13 , ordered fe vacancies with large iron magnetic moments , whereas superconducting phase is free of vacancies.@xcite resistivity measurements on the sample with nominal composition k@xmath3fe@xmath2se@xmath2 revealed that superconductivity occurs below @xmath10@xmath1430 k.@xcite however , it was later established that superconductivity appears only in fe - deficient samples .",
    "broad hump in the in - plane resistivity @xmath15 , whose position varies between 105 - 240 k ( depending on the sample preparation ) , pressumably occurs due to the type of connection between two phases.@xcite below the hump , k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is metallic due to an intrinsic property of metallic / superconducting state , since insulating regions do not contribute to the spectral weight close to fermi energy , as observed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite it was also shown that m - doping on the fe - site ( m = cr , co , ni , zn ) strongly suppresses superconductivity.@xcite however , the correlation between antiferromagnetically ordered iron vacancies and superconductivity remains unclear .",

    "their analysis revealed that phonon of unknown origin , at about 180 @xmath8 ( which was assigned as a@xmath16 symmetry mode ) exhibits abrupt hardening of @xmath141 @xmath8 at the superconducting critical temperature @xmath10 .",

    "to the best of our knowledge , raman spectrum of the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystals doped with co is unknown .    in order to determine the impact of superconductivity on phonon properties of alkali - doped iron selenides , we have performed raman scattering study of superconducting k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and nonsuperconducting k@xmath3fe@xmath4co@xmath5se@xmath2 single crystals .",

    "behavior of the phonon modes with temperature can be properly described in terms of the phonon self - energy:@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents change of the raman mode energy and @xmath50 is the mode linewidth , which is inversely proportional to the phonon lifetime @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , temperature dependance of raman mode energy can be described with : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is temperature independent contribution to the energy of the phonon mode @xmath54 and @xmath49 can be decomposed as:@xcite @xmath55 the first term in ( 3 ) represents change of phonon energy due to the thermal expansion of the crystal lattice , and is given by@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the grneisen parameter of a given mode and @xmath58 is volume thermal expansion coefficient of a material under investigation .",
    "the second term in ( 3 ) describes contribution of phonon - phonon scattering ( lattice anharmonicity ) to the raman mode energy .",

    "it can be seen that parameter @xmath60 has very small values for both modes , thus contribution to the raman mode energy from the phonon - phonon interaction ( as can be seen in figure  [ fig4 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) and ( f ) ) can be neglected .",

    "this results in a clear deviation from the expected behavior described with eq .",
    "( 2 ) and is governed by some other interaction .",
    "it is well established that upon entering superconducting state , some of the phonons are renormalized due to the change in electronic structure with the superconducting gap opening , and therefore electron - phonon coupling . depending on the values of the corresponding phonon energies and the superconducting gap magnitude , it may result in hardening or softening of the phonons.@xcite recently , the superconductivity - induced self - energy effect have also been reported in some iron arsenides.@xcite we believe that the a@xmath9 mode hardening around @xmath10 , observed for the superconducting and absent for the non - superconducting sample ( see inset of figure  [ fig6 ] ) , is caused by superconductivity induced phonon renormalizaton .",
