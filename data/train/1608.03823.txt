    "the triangulations of manifolds have played great role in understanding the topology of the underlying manifold .",

    "the study minimal triangulations ( triangulations with least number of vertices or edges and so on ) is a part of combinatorial topology .",
    "minimal triangulations are closely tied up with the topology of the underlying manifold .",

    "by frobenius theorem , the non - integrability of @xmath2 is equivalent to @xmath4 . in this case , we call @xmath3 as a contact form . throughout the article we will consider contact structures that are defined by kernel of some 1-form . for instance",
    ", on @xmath5 the 1-form @xmath6 defines a contact structure .",
    "we denote @xmath7 by @xmath8 .    in the recent past",
    ", the contact structures have been studied with great interest for various reasons . in dimension three",
    ", there is a tremendous progress ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in understanding the contact structures . to begin with , it is known that every closed oriented 3-manifold admits a contact structure ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the notion of cellular decomposition that is compatible with contact structure has been used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thi is formally known as _ contact cellular decomposition _ ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.1 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.7 ) ) .",
    "it has been used to show existence of open books and partial open books .",
    "inspired from this notion , we take the following definition of contact triangulation .",
    "let @xmath9 be a contact 3-manifold .",
    "a triangulation @xmath10 of @xmath1 is said to be a _ contact triangulation _ if ( i ) all the edges of @xmath10 are legendrian ( i.e. , edges are tangent to contact plane at all points ) , ( ii ) no 2-face of @xmath10 is an overtwisted disk ( see section [ ot_disk_dfn ] for the definition of overtwisted disk ) , and ( iii ) the restriction of @xmath11 to the interior of each 3-face of @xmath10 is contactomorphic to the standard contact structure @xmath12 for some open set @xmath13 . hence , no 3-face contains an overtwisted disk .",
    "we note that this definition differs from that of contact cellular decompostion on the following point . in the earlier notion ,",
    "the 2-faces are required to satisfy the condition that the twisting number @xmath14 is @xmath15 along the boundary of each 2-face .",
    "we relax this condition as we need to subdivide the triangulation in order to achieve @xmath16 . from the combinatorial view point , this imposes additional problem as the growth of minimum number of vertices is exponential and difficult to keep track of .",
    "instead , with the above notion , as we will show later , it is easier to capture geometric complexity of contact structures .",
    "for an explicit example of a contact triangulation see example [ explicit_example ] .    as noted before , the notion of contact triangulations ( contact cellular decomposition to be precise )",
    "is used to obtain qualitative results . on the other hand ,",
    "quantitative aspect of contact triangulations has not been studied before as far as we know .",
    "we say that a contact triangulation @xmath17 of @xmath9 is _ minimal _ if the number of vertices in @xmath17 gives the lower bound for the number of vertices for any contact triangulation of @xmath9 .",
    "one expects that minimal contact triangulations should reflect the complexity of the contact manifold .",
    "thus , the following questions are of interest .    given a contact 3-manifold @xmath9 , what is the minimum number of vertices @xmath18 required to have a contact triangulation of @xmath9",
    "? how does the number @xmath18 change if we change @xmath19 on @xmath1 ?",
    "in general it is hard to give examples of minimal triangulations .",
    "the same holds true of minimal contact triangulations .",
    "there is dichotomy of contact structures .",
    "the notion of overtwisted and tight ( see section [ ot_disk_dfn ] ) contact structures was introduced by eliashberg in @xcite . the classification ( up to isotopy ) of contact structures is relatively easier for overtwisted contact structures than tight ones .",
    "eliashberg showed that overtwisted contact structures are classified completely by the homotopy classes of contact structures as 2-plane fields .",
    "however , existence and classification problem of tight contact structure is not completely understood in generality .",
    "if we take a triangulation of @xmath9 with @xmath11 tight then we can deform it into a contact triangulation by applying small perturbations ( see lemma [ tight_triangulation ] ) .",
    "thus , for tight contact structures minimal contact triangulations coincide with minimal triangulations of the underlying manifold",
