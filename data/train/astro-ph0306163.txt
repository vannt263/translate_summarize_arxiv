    "imaging studies of the host galaxies of low redshift bl lac objects ( e.g. falomo 1996 ; wurtz , stocke & yee 1996 ; falomo & kotilainen 1999 ; urry et al .",
    "2000 ) have consistently shown that this kind of nuclear activity is exclusively hosted by luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "detailed studies of the nearest ( z @xmath8 0.2 ) objects have indicated that the structural properties of the hosts of these agn are indistinguishable from those of normal unperturbed massive ellipticals ( falomo et al .",
    "similar studies conducted on a large sample of nearby radio galaxies ( govoni et al .",
    "2000 ) have shown them to have also photometrical and structural global properties close to those of inactive spheroids .",
    "these observations lend support to the unified model for radio - loud agn ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) that interpret bl lac objects as a subset of radio galaxies with the jet pointing close to our line - of - sight .",
    "on the other hand , it is also well known that the global properties of early  type galaxies , such as the effective radius @xmath9 , the average surface brightness @xmath10 and the central velocity dispersion @xmath11 are linked fairly well through the so - called fundamental plane ( hereafter fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 , dressler et al .",
    "this is in fact what is expected if galaxies are virialized systems , have constant m / l ratio and are homologous structures .    indeed ,",
    "real galaxies deviate from the fp defined by the virial equilibrium under the above hypotheses ( e.g. burstein et al .",
    "1997 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 ) and define a plane that is tilted with respect to the virial fp .",
    "the differences from the canonical fp are interpreted as due to changes in the m / l ratio ( due to different stellar content or differences in the dark matter distribution ; pahre , djorgovski & de carvalho 1995 ; mobasher et al .",
    "1999 ) , or to the breakdown of the homology assumption ( e.g. kinematic anisotropy ; ciotti , lanzoni & renzini 1996 ; busarello et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in the context of the link between galactic properties and the nuclear activity",
    ", it is important to understand if active galaxies define the same fp as normal ( inactive ) ellipticals .",
    "a recent study of a large sample of powerful radio galaxies ( bettoni et al 2001 ) has provided clear evidence that this is the case .",
    "the host galaxies of these radio sources define in fact an fp that is fully consistent with that of inactive ellipticals with the only difference of sampling the most luminous ( and massive ) objects of the luminosity function of early type galaxies .",
    "in this paper we present new measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) in the host galaxies of four bl lac objects that together with our earlier results on seven bl lac objects ( falomo , kotilainen & treves 2002 , hereafter fkt02 ) , and with the previous determinations of the global photometrical and structural host properties , are used to construct the fp of bl lacs and to compare it with that of radio galaxies and normal ellipticals .",
    "in addition , we make use of the correlation relating the central black hole ( bh ) mass ( @xmath1 ) with @xmath0 of the spheroidal component in nearby inactive galaxies ( e.g. gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) to infer the @xmath1 of our sample of bl lacs thus expanding our previous study ( fkt02 ) . similar measurements of the velocity dispersion of bl lacs ( with many objects in common with our sample ) have been reported recently by barth , ho & sargent ( 2003 ; hereafter bhs03 ) .",
    "preliminary results of this work are given in treves et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and falomo et al .",
    "hubble constant h@xmath12 = 50 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 and @xmath14 = 0 are used throughout this paper .",
    "the spectra were obtained in june 2001 using the eso 3.6 m telescope equipped with efosc2 .",
    "two grisms were used covering the spectral ranges 4400  6300   ( setup a ) and 6300  8000    ( setup b ) at 0.54   pixel@xmath13 and 1.3   pixel@xmath13 dispersion , respectively .",
    "the absorption lines from the host galaxies which are considered in our analysis comprise of h@xmath15 ( 4861  ) , mg i ( 5175  ) , ca e - band ( 5269  ) , na i ( 5892  ) and the tio + cai ( 6178  ) and tio + fei ( 6266  ) blends .",
    "the grisms and a 1  slit yield a spectral resolution of @xmath1660  80 km s@xmath13 , which is adequate for the expected range of @xmath0 in luminous ellipticals ( e.g. djorgovski & davis 1987 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) such as the hosts of bl lacs .",
    "in addition , spectra of bright ki - kiii stars that exhibit a low rotational velocity ( v@xmath2@xmath1720 km s@xmath13 ) were taken to be used as templates of zero velocity dispersion .",
    "furthermore , spectra of the nearby elliptical galaxies ngc 2986 , ngc 5831 and ngc 7562 were secured to provide a test of the adopted procedure to derive @xmath0 .    during the observations , seeing ranged between 0.8  and 1.3  .",
    "the slit was positioned on the nucleus and the 1d spectrum was extracted from a 3  - 5  diameter aperture , which was always within the effective radius of the host galaxy in order to minimize aperture corrections .. the iraf package was used for data reduction , including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration and extraction of 1d spectra . for each source , two spectra were combined to remove cosmic ray hits and other occasional spurious signals in the detector . in table 1",
    "we give the observed sources , the instrumental setup , exposure times , and the s / n of final spectra that are reported in fig .",
    "1 ( also for sources studied in fkt02 ) .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath0 was determined using the fourier quotient method ( e.g. sargent et al .",
    "the spectra were normalized by subtracting the continuum , converted to a logarithmic scale and multiplied by a cosine bell function that apodizes 10% of the pixels at each end of the spectrum .",
    "for all the new observed objects but for pks 054832 the optical spectrum shows emission lines ( mainly h@xmath18 , h@xmath19 and [ oiii ] 5007  ) .",
    "these features have been removed by a linear interpolation of the adjacent continuum .",
    "finally , the fourier transforms of the galaxy spectra were divided by the fourier transforms of template stars and @xmath0 was computed from a @xmath20 fit with a gaussian broadening function ( see e.g. bertola et al . 1984 ; kuijken & merrifield 1993 ) .",
    "the scatter of the @xmath0 measurements using different template stars was typically @xmath1610 km@xmath21 and can be considered as the minimum uncertainty . since early - type galaxies exhibit gradients in velocity dispersion ( davies et al 1983 , fisher , illingworth & franx 1995 ) , the measured values of @xmath0",
    "have been referred to a common aperture adopting the procedure described in falomo et al .",
    "the observed values of @xmath0 and their estimated errors are given in table 1 , and the results for the full sample ( including those from fkt02 are given in table 2 .",
    "for the three nearby galaxies we find a good agreement with the previously published values of @xmath0 ( prugniel et al 1998 ) .    for three objects",
    "we have spectra in both spectral ranges .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath0 are in all cases in good agreement , with average difference 12 km s@xmath13 , ensuring sufficient homogeneity of data taken with different grisms and/or resolution . for pks 2201 + 04",
    "the present results are very similar to those obtained by us at the not ( fkt02 ) . for the following discussion",
    "the average of the pair of measurements was thus used .",
    "bhs03 have recently reported measurements of @xmath0 for 11 bl lac objects .",
    "nine of them are in common with our sample , and it is therefore enlightening to directly compare the results .",
    "for some common objects the @xmath0 values of bhs03 are derived from the near - infrared caii triplet lines , while our measurements refer to the visual - red spectral region , including the g - band , ( 4304  ) , mg i ( 5175  ) , ca e - band ( 5269  ) , na i ( 5892  ) and the tio + cai ( 6178  ) , tio + fei ( 6266  ) at rest frame . moreover , bhs03 use a different method ( direct spectral fitting ) from ours to derive @xmath0 .",
    "these differences , and the use of different templates , can explain modest ( @xmath22 20 km / s ) differences in @xmath0 .",
    "larger differences are more difficult to give reasons for .",
    "bhs03 assert that their measurements are more accurate because of higher s / n of their data and the possibility that our measurements are biased by interstellar absorption and metallicity effects . while it is certainly true that bhs03 acquired higher s / n",
    ", we believe that the na i interstellar absorption in the host galaxies has little , even negligible , effect since all the elliptical host galaxies are likely to be gas - poor . in the cases where we have data in both spectral ranges ( including and excluding the na i line ) , we find no significant difference in the derived values of @xmath0 .",
    "galactic na i absorption occurs at different wavelength than in the ( redshifted ) bl lac hosts and therefore does not contribute to the broadening of the intrinsic na i line .",
    "moreover , the elimination of emission lines by a linear continuum interpolation has no effect on the fourier analysis since it introduces low spatial frequencies that are removed in the gaussian fitting of the real part of the power spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , metallicity effects on the strength of the mg i feature are more challenging to take into account .",
    "note , however , that most of the @xmath0 data used to derive the m@xmath23 ",
    "@xmath0 relation for ellipticals were obtained in the visible region ( e.g. davies et al .",
    "1987 ) , including the mg i feature , and using a method very similar to ours .",
    "we believe that to derive bh masses it is paramount to have consistent measurements for the targets and the calibrators .",
    "while a good agreement is found for most objects , some discrepancies remain .",
    "the largest differences of @xmath0 between bhs03 and this work are for mrk 501 and i zw 187 , up to 80 km / s and in opposite directions . for mrk 501 ( see also fkt02 ) , our value of @xmath0 is consistent with that expected for the luminosity of the host galaxy and gives consistent results for the bh mass ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . for i",
    "zw 187 , we obtained only a relatively poor s / n spectrum and therefore our determination of @xmath0 remains more uncertain .",
    "the influence of these differences in @xmath0 for estimating the bh masses is discussed in the next section .",
    "unlike most agn , bl lac objects are characterized by the weakness or absence of emission lines .",
    "this prevents us from deriving an estimate of the central bh mass from the kinematics of regions that are gravitationally bound to the bh , as in seyfert galaxies and quasars ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2001 ) .",
    "a powerful ( even if indirect ) way to obtain bh masses is thus to use the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 for nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "since all sources considered here are at @xmath24 0.1 we assume that possible cosmological evolution of the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath0 relation is negligible . we have adopted the updated relationship ( derived only from ellipticals ) by bettoni et al . (",
    "2003 ) who assume the same cosmology used here and the same calibrations for the velocity dispersion and the magnitudes .",
    "the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath0 is :    @xmath26    we assume that this relationship is valid also for agn ( e.g. merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) and in particular for bl lacs which have elliptical hosts ( e.g. falomo & kotilainen 1999 ; falomo et al . 2000 ; urry et al .",
    "the derived values of @xmath1 are given in table 2 , they are in the range of @xmath27 to @xmath28 . the typical error ( median value ) on these estimated bh masses , taking into account the uncertainties in @xmath0 and in the m@xmath23  @xmath0 relationship given by bettoni et al ( 2003 ) is @xmath16 0.15dex ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 is also correlated with the luminosity of the bulge of the host galaxy ( e.g. kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes m@xmath29 of the bl lac hosts are given in table 2 .",
    "@xmath1 was thus calculated following the updated relationship for ellipticals ( bettoni et al .",
    "2003 ) :    @xmath30    the resulting values of @xmath1 are given in table 2 .",
    "for most sources , the difference of @xmath1 derived from the two methods is within the estimated uncertainty but for two objects ( pks 2201 + 04 and exo 0706.1 + 5913 ) the difference is @xmath16 0.5dex .",
    "the average values of @xmath1 for the bl lacs from the two methods are : @xmath31 = 8.57 @xmath32 0.12 and @xmath33 = 8.63 @xmath32 0.08 with an average difference of @xmath34 -0.07 @xmath32 0.09 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use the @xmath0 values from bhs03 we find : @xmath31 = 8.48 @xmath32 0.14 and @xmath33 = 8.68 @xmath32 0.08 with an average difference of @xmath34 -0.21 @xmath32 0.10 .    in fig .",
    "2 we compare the bh masses derived from the m@xmath23 - m(bulge ) relation with those obtained from our adopted m@xmath23 - @xmath0 relation , using both ours and bhs03 values of @xmath0 . there is a generally good agreement between the two methods , although the data from bhs03 tend to systematically deviate to lower bh masses .",
    "this suggests that some systematic effect may be present in the @xmath0 values obtained by bhs03 .",
    "according to the shape of their spectral energy distribution , bl lacs are distinguished into two types : low frequency peaked ( lbl ) and high frequency peaked ( hbl ; see giommi & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "based on bh masses derived from the peak luminosity and its frequency , wang , xue & wang ( 2001 ) proposed that lbls have significantly ( by @xmath16 2dex ) smaller bh masses than hbls . in our sample , there are nine hbls and only 3 lbls ( marked as h or l in table 2 ) . with the caveat of small number statistics ,",
    "we find no significant difference of @xmath1 in the two types of bl lacs .",
    "this result is confirmed by the analysis of @xmath1 , derived from host luminosity , for a larger sample of bl lacs ( falomo , carangelo & treves 2003 ) .",
    "the measurements of @xmath0 and the effective radii of the host galaxies can be used to estimate the mass of the hosts through the relationship ( bender et al 1992 ) :    @xmath35 = 5@xmath36/g .",
    "( 3 )    the two quantities @xmath1 and @xmath35 are consistent with a linear relation and their average ratio is @xmath37/@xmath38 = 1.0 @xmath2 10@xmath39 .",
    "this is very similar to values found for other types of active and inactive galaxies ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2002 ; bettoni et al .",
    "2003 ) and indicates that the mass of the spheroid is fundamentally linked to the mass of the central bh .",
    "the kinematical measurement of the velocity dispersion of the host galaxies of bl lacs allows us to construct the fp of these active galaxies and to compare it with that obtained for other active and inactive ellipticals .",
    "we use the full sample of 12 bl lacs for which @xmath0 has been measured ( this work ; fkt02 ; bhs03 ) .",
    "since our spectrum of i zw 187 has rather low s / n , we prefer to adopt for it the value of @xmath0 reported by bhs03 .    for all these bl lacs ,",
    "hst / wfpc2 and/or ground - based images are available to derive the global properties ( luminosity and scale - length ) of the host galaxies . in table 2",
    "we report the data for the 12 bl lacs used to construct the fp .",
    "note that while the apparent magnitude of the host galaxies derived from ground - based and hst images agree reasonably well , the effective radius may be different by more than a factor of two .",
    "as pointed out also by bhs03 , the effective radius estimated from hst images tends to be smaller than that obtained from ground - based data .",
    "this is likely due to the small field of view of wfpc2 ( @xmath1635 arcsec ) with respect to the full size ( @xmath1630   40  ) of the most nearby objects .",
    "in fact , this trend disappears when more distant objects are considered ( e.g. falomo & kotilainen 1999 ) . for the purpose of this work",
    "we have collected all published data reporting both total apparent magnitude ( in the r band ) and the effective radius .",
    "the adopted quantities for each object are derived from the median value of all available data . in table 2",
    "we report these values together with the r.m.s .",
    "scatter for the effective radius for all objects with at least two usable measurements . from the apparent magnitudes and the effective radii r@xmath40 of the host galaxies",
    "we have obtained the average surface brightness @xmath41 within r@xmath40 .",
    "all magnitude values have then been corrected for galactic extinction ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) , k - correction ( poggianti 1997 ) and cosmological ( 1+z)@xmath42 dimming of the surface brightness .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the fp of the bl lacs compared with that of low redshift radio galaxies ( bettoni et al .",
    "2001 ) and normal ellipticals ( jrgensen , franx & kjaergaard 1996 ) .",
    "this is a homogeneous comparison because all data sets were analyzed identically .",
    "we find a remarkable agreement between the fp defined by normal ( inactive ) galaxies , radio galaxies and bl lac host galaxies .",
    "a similar result was also obtained by bhs03 who presented velocity dispersion measurements for most of the objects discussed here .",
    "the hosts of bl lacs tend to occupy the intermediate region of the fp , in agreement with the fact that the hosts of bl lacs are luminous ellipticals but rarely at the bright end of the lf of massive ellipticals ( falomo carangelo & treves 2003 ) .",
    "the comparison of the kinematical , photometrical and structural properties of bl lac hosts with those of radio galaxies and inactive ellipticals over the fp shows that their global properties are indistinguishable .",
    "this result strengthens the idea that a massive elliptical galaxy may undergo a phase of nuclear activity with little ( or negligible ) effect on its global structure .",
    "moreover , it gives support to the hypothesis that the relations connecting the mass of the central bh with the velocity dispersion and luminosity of nearby inactive ellipticals , can be extended to ellipticals with nuclear activity .",
    "the similarity of the bh masses obtained with the two techniques for bl lac objects ( previous section ) , shows that this picture is becoming self - consistent .    for more powerful active galaxies ( e.g. radio - loud quasars ) , there are no kinematical data available ,",
    "so it is not possible to compare the global properties of their host galaxies in the fp .",
    "we note , however , that at least at low redshift , the morphology and the photometrical properties of quasar hosts agree well with those of luminous inactive ellipticals ( e.g. dunlop et al .",
    "we have presented kinematical data for a small sample of the host galaxies of nearby bl lacs objects that were previously investigated through images .",
    "the combined photometric and spectroscopic data allow us to construct the fundamental plane for this class of active galaxies and to compare it with that of other elliptical galaxies .",
    "the main result of this work , together with that by bhs03 , show that the host galaxies of bl lacs define a fp that is indistinguishable from that of low @xmath43 radio galaxies and normal ( inactive ) ellipticals .",
    "this further strengthens the idea that the nuclear activity may occur in all massive spheroids without producing significant changes in the global structural and kinematical properties of the galaxies .",
    "in addition , and consistently with the above result , we have also shown that the bh mass derived either from the m@xmath23 ",
    "@xmath0 or @xmath1 - m@xmath29 ( bulge ) relations yield consistent results .",
    "the bh mass of the majority of bl lacs being contained in the range 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath44 m@xmath5 with no difference between hbl and lbl .",
