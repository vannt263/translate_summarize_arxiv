    "in this paper we report our preliminary findings within a larger program which aims at the development of a theory of non equilibrium first order phase transitions , such as have occurred in the early universe ( grand unified and electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite ) and , possibly , in the first stages of heavy ion collisions ( chiral symmetry breaking and confinement @xcite ) . for this reason , we must seek a description of the decay process which emphasizes the dynamical aspects , over the static aspects encoded in the effective potential .",
    "vacuum decay in field theory is described with a potential which displays a local minimum , separated from the absolute minimum by a potential barrier .",
    "a system prepared in the false vacuum state ( metastable phase ) within the potential well may decay in essentially two different ways , namely ( a ) by tunneling effect , that is , by going through the barrier in a classically forbidden trajectory @xcite , or else , ( b ) by activation , that is , by jumping above the barrier @xcite . in either case",
    ", the decay probability follows the law @xmath2 which gives the probability per unit time and unit volume to nucleate a region of the stable phase within the metastable phase . in the tunneling effect , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is planck s constant and @xmath5 is the action for the trajectory which goes under the barrier in imaginary time @xcite . in thermal activation ,",
    "@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is boltzman s constant , @xmath8 the temperature , and @xmath9 is the height of the free energy measured from the false vacuum @xcite .",
    "thus , activation disappears as @xmath10 .    in systems with few degrees of freedom",
    ", there must be an external agent , typically a thermal source , for activation to be possible .",
    "our thesis is that in field theories there is a phenomenon similar to activation even at zero temperature .",
    "this comes from the observation that in a field theory , when a mode decomposition of the field is made , there are only a few long wavelenghts modes which are unstable and decay .",
    "these nearly homogeneous modes may be regarded as an open system , which interacts with the environment provided by the shorter wavelength modes .",
    "it is then possible to describe the quantum evolution of the system in terms of an effective dynamics , whereby the interaction with the environment results in the onset of dissipation and noise .",
    "the ultimate reason for the presence of a finite activation rate even at zero temperature is that , for a generic field theory the dynamics of these homogeneous modes is anharmonic enough to contain fourier components with frequencies above the threshold for excitation of the short wavelength modes .",
    "this results in an energy transfer from the long wavelength or homogeneous modes to the short wavelength or inhomogeneous modes through particle creation .",
    "as demanded by the energy balance , and encoded in the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , this energy flow is compensated by a stochastic force on the homogeneous modes , originated in fluctuations of the inhomogeneous modes .",
    "thus the dynamics of the homogeneous modes becomes diffussive , even if , properly speaking , there is no external `` environment '' to the field @xcite .",
    "we wish to stress that this is not only a theoretical possibility . in this paper",
    ", we will show through a detailed analysis of a concrete model that the activation rate makes a substantial contribution to the full decay rate even at zero temperature . in the process",
    ", we shall develop the necessary formalism to compute the activation rate to leading order in @xmath4",
    ".    the key ingredient will be the description of the quantum state of the long wavelength modes of the field by means of the reduced wigner function .",
    "this function has the same information that the reduced density matrix of an open quantum system but is similar in many aspects to a distribution function in phase - space .",
    "the dynamical equation for the reduced wigner function ( master equation ) includes noise terms produced by the short wavelength modes to quadratic order in the parameter coupling the short and long wavelength modes .",
    "we shall derive the tunneling rate from an analysis of the decay of non trivial solutions of the master equation , after suitable boundary conditions have been enforced .",
    "the master equation contains all required information on vacuum decay , including both the  tunneling \" aspect of the homogeneous mode as well as  activation \" , _",
    "i.e. _ the effect due to the back reaction of the inhomogeneous modes , but in this paper we concentrate in the activation aspect .",
    "thus , whereas the instanton method @xcite , for instance , seems to be best suited to describe the pure tunneling of the homogeneous mode , the effect due to the back reaction of the inhomogeneous modes seems to be best described by the present method .",
    "another advantage of this approach , which was one of our first motivatons , is that whereas the instanton method works well for processes not far from equilibrium , this method should work also for out of equilibrium situations since it is based on a real time evolution equation such as the master equation .",
    "our conclusion shall be that , for a physically well motivated system - environment separation , the contribution to the exponent coming from quantum fluctuations in the short wavelength modes is comparable to , but distinguishable from , the contribution from tunneling under the barrier by the long wavelength modes themselves .",
    "which contribution is actually dominant will depend on the specifics of each model .",
    "therefore , the approaches that underplay backreaction from the short wavelenght modes , underestimate the tunneling rate , and may even miss the largest contribution .    comparing with the literature on tunneling in open and driven systems ,",
    "the main difference is that we do not assume a priori any features of the noise and dissipation , but rather derive them from the underlying unitary field theory . in practice , this means that we shall have to deal with non - local dissipation and coloured noise . also for simplicity",
    ", we shall focus on computing the exponent in the tunneling rate to leading order in @xmath4 , and at zero temperature . as a matter of fact , this is the difficult case , since at high temperature the interaction of the short and long wavelength modes is just another aspect of the interaction with the heat bath .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ i1 ] we briefly review current theories of vacuum decay and place our work in that context . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we present the basic derivation of the master equation for the reduced wigner function for a quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) model which is of relevance for our problem .",
    "the model is an open quantum system consisting of of a massive particle in an arbitrary potential coupled to an infinite set of harmonic oscillators , the coupling is linear in the system variables but quadratic in the oscillator coordinates . for our problem",
    "the master equation reduces to a fokker - planck like equation . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we consider a field theory model consisting of a massive scalar field with a negative cubic potential term .",
    "the long and short wavelength modes of the field are separated and we reduce the problem to a system - environment interaction similar to the qbm model discussed in the previous section .",
    "the relevant kernels for the corresponding fokker - planck equation are calculated .",
    "[ iv ] contains the derivation of the tunneling rate from the analysis of the solutions to the fokker - planck equation .",
    "we discuss our results in the final section .",
    "a number of appendices carry some of the unavoidable technical details .",
    "the twin issues of thermal activation and spontaneous nucleation have a long and distinguished history ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review . in its simplest formulation ,",
    "we deal with a quantum mechanical system with one degree of freedom @xmath11 and hamiltonian @xmath12 , where @xmath13 has the generic form shown in the figure .",
    "it is an experimental fact that even if we prepare the system to be confined to the neighborhood of the `` false vacuum '' @xmath14 , and the barrier is much higher than the typical energies accesible to the system ( @xmath15 in the quantum mechanical problem , @xmath16 at finite temperature ) , the system will find a way to escape from the potential well after some typical time @xmath17 has ellapsed .",
    "the problem is to estimate the `` mean life '' @xmath17 or equivalently the `` tunneling rate '' @xmath18 .",
    "vacuum decay can be formulated as a steady state problem if we inject particles into the system in order to keep a constant population in the false vacuum state .",
    "we then have a constant flux of particles impinging on the barrier from the left , and the problem reduces to the computation of the transmission coefficient @xcite . in quantum mechanics , this is readily obtained within the wkb approximation , and the result is the arrhenius - like expression @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a prefactor of order @xmath21 , and we have set the classical energy of the false vacuum to @xmath22 .",
    "this formula describes vacuum decay through tunneling , that is , an essentially quantum phenomenon .",
    "if we allow the system to interact with an external noise source ( typically a heat bath at a given temperature @xmath8 ) , then the energy of the system alone is no longer conserved , and the system can jump over the barrier , resulting in vacuum decay through activation",
    ". the activation rate has been computed , within the `` constant flux '' approach , by kramers @xcite and langer @xcite .",
    "they show that equation ( [ arrhenius ] ) still holds , but the exponent @xmath23 becomes @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the activation free energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the height of the free energy barrier to be overcome .    a less artificial approach attempts to compute the actual time evolution of the false vacuum state @xmath26 .",
    "this is not a stationary state of the system , but it may be expanded in energy eigenstates @xmath27 . the amplitude of @xmath27 in the expansion of @xmath26 peaks around @xmath28 , and for small energy may be approximated by the breit - wigner form @xcite @xmath29 at long , but not too long , times we obtain @xmath30 .",
    "the false vacuum behaves as an energy eigenstate with complex energy @xmath31 ( complex energies and eigenstates may be defined within an extended formalism of quantum mechanics @xcite ) , and the mean life is @xmath32 .",
    "the calculation of activation rates in the `` complex energy '' approach has been worked out by langer @xcite .",
    "the idea is to define a `` free energy '' for an ensemble of unstable configurations including the critical droplet .",
    "this `` free energy '' is complex , and its imaginary part is related to the mean life as in the quantum mechanical problem . the physical free energy , of course , is real , and it is given by maxwell s construction @xcite .",
    "coleman and collaborators have proposed a simple and elegant way to compute the complex false vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the vacuum energy can be expressed in terms of a path integral over euclidean histories with appropiate boundary conditions . for unstable systems ,",
    "the path integral must be computed by analytic continuation , and an imaginary part appears . in certain cases it is possible to show that the path integral is dominated by the contributions from a discrete set of saddle points , corresponding to sequences of `` bounces '' against the inner sides of the barrier with little or no overlap between bounces .",
    "then the formula in eq .",
    "( [ arrhenius ] ) is recovered , where @xmath5 is now interpreted as the euclidean action for the one bounce solution , also called the `` instanton '' .    the instanton method is easily generalized to the thermal case @xcite .",
    "the idea is to write the partition function for the unstable system as a path integral over euclidean configurations with periodicity @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) in euclidean time , and then to evaluate the path integral in the saddle point approximation . due to new boundary conditions",
    ", the thermal instanton may not be the same as the instanton at @xmath35 .",
    "the change in the nature of the instanton gives a simple and compelling interpretation of the crossover from spontaneous transition to thermal activation @xcite .",
    "the tunneling rate can also be derived from the large order behavior of perturbation theory @xcite      all approaches discussed so far have natural generalizations to systems with few degrees of freedom . in the case of the instanton approach ,",
    "the generalization is almost immediate , only one has to take care of symmetries of the system which may appear as zero modes in the spectrum of perturbations around the instanton solution , thus causing an apparent divergence of the path integral . these symmetries may be handled by isolating them as collective modes prior to the saddle point evaluation of the path integral @xcite .    the `` constant flux '' approach is implemented by seeking a solution to the schrdinger equation within the wkb or born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite .",
    "the idea is to identify a single variable @xmath11 which parametrizes the `` most probable scape path '' , namely the path across the saddle separating the false and true vacua .",
    "then one uses a mixed ansatz for the wave function , whereby it is assumed to be gaussian on all other variables , and of wkb form with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "`` under the barrier '' , the wkbapproximation leads to a hamilton - jacobi equation for a particle moving in an inverted potential , the same dynamical problem one confronts in the instanton method , although now the potential may be modified by terms arising from the zero point energies of the transversal modes ; but not of @xmath11 itself @xcite .",
    "this solution is then matched to oscillatory solutions on either side of the barrier .",
    "conceptually , the wkb method has some advantages over the instanton method @xcite . in the first place ,",
    "the connection to the schrdinger equation is much more straightforward .",
    "also , one has more control on the quantum state of the transversal degrees of freedom , which then allows one to ask questions like whether tunneling is associated to particle creation @xcite .",
    "finally , it has proved easier to define the range of validity of the approximations involved in the wkb framework than in the euclidean path integral one .",
    "however , they are likely to be equivalent in last analysis , and the conclusion that these methods work best when the tunneling variable @xmath11 is slow compared with the transversal modes probably holds equally well for both approaches @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for recents developments along these lines , and to ref .",
    "@xcite for an example of similar techniques in a different context .",
    "some nonequilibrium aspects of vacuum decay have been the focus of work by boyanovsky et al .",
    "they show that realistic initial conditions usually imply a nonzero probability for the system to be at the unstable configuration in the saddle of the free energy surface . starting from this configuration",
    ", the roll down of the system towards the true vacuum may be analyzed by usual nonequilibrium field theory methods .",
    "however , the initial amplitude is still computed by conventional methods , such as discussed so far .",
    "gervais , sakita and de vega have applied the wkb method to tunneling in quantum field theory @xcite ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for instanton and complex - time methods . in spite of the obvious similitudes ,",
    "there are some important differences between the problem of tunneling in field theory and in systems with few degrees of freedom .",
    "some of these differences are technical in nature , such as the need to carefully account for loop corrections to the effective potential @xcite , and to adopt a regularization procedure to compute the prefactor in the arrhenius formula @xcite , which would be divergent if naively computed .",
    "there is also a fundamental conceptual difference which we now discuss .",
    "a field theory only makes sense , from the physical point of view , if it is understood as an effective theory describing the low frequency sector of a more fundamental theory , whose high frequency degrees of freedom may be totally unlike continuous fields ; such as strings in elementary particle physics , discrete lattices in condensed matter applications , molecules in hydrodynamics @xcite .    one clear way to bring this point home is by explicitly integrating out all modes with wave number @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is some cutoff .",
    "the remaining modes are described by a coarse grained effective potential @xcite .",
    "as @xmath37 decreases from @xmath38 to @xmath22 , the coarse grained effective potential interpolates between the `` bare '' potential shown in the figure to the maxwell construction free energy @xcite , showing the drastic effect of the short wavelength modes or high frequency sector on the physics of the long wavelength modes or low frequency sector . at some point",
    "the barrier separating the different metastable points dissapears , reflecting the effect of averaging the field over distances much larger than a domain .      as we have seen from earlier studies of the coarse grained effective potential , tunneling in field theory should be properly posed as an open quantum system problem .",
    "however , the nature of tunneling in an open system can not be described adequately by just computing changes in an effective potential . besides the static changes reflected by the scale dependent effective potential",
    ", the dynamics of the long wavelength modes will become both dissipative and stochastic .",
    "the onset of dissipation and noise is also generic to semiclassical @xcite and effective theories @xcite .    for the present discussion it is essential to realize that noise and dissipation",
    "are actually two aspects of a single phenomenon , the dynamical action and back - reaction between `` system '' and `` environment '' . in equilibrium situations ,",
    "this inner relationship can be made explicit through the  fluctuation - dissipation \" relation @xcite .",
    "a simple way to deal with tunneling in open systems is to model the environment explicitly within a larger system - environment complex , in effect reducing the problem to tunneling in many degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , it is essential to avoid approximations ( such as assuming that the environment degrees of freedom perform linear oscillations around a prescribed trajectory of the system ) which in practice underplay the back reaction of the environment on the system , and thus break the balance between fluctuation and dissipation .",
    "the relevance of the fluctuation - dissipation relation to tunneling has been emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the broadening of the reduced wigner function of the open system by external noise has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . unlike the present work",
    ", these authors consider an external noise source , whose spectral features may be chosen at will . in order to give an adequate account of back reaction , bruinsma and bak @xcite",
    "have proposed treating the system as propagating in a random medium , the randomness being associated to the environmental variables . in a second step , a path integration over histories of the bath allows the computation of the tunneling rate . as in the present work",
    ", a serious consideration of back reaction leads to describing the system as a driven system , subject to stochastic forces originating from the environment .",
    "the theory of vacuum decay in open systems has points of contact with the problem of decay in driven systems @xcite , although in these later studies usually the properties of the driving force are assumed a priori , rather than derived from a more comprehensive model .",
    "it is also possible to obtain a path integral representation of the solution of a langevin equation , whereby an open system may be subsumed into a larger field theory @xcite .",
    "@xcite for further developments .",
    "semiclassical field theories , where some fields are treated as c - number , while the rest is described quantum mechanically , may be seen as open systems , with the classical fields as the system and the quantum fields as the environment .",
    "quantum fluctuations in the system are registered as noise by the environment , and may induce transitions .",
    "an early application of these ideas appeared within starobinsky s `` stochastic inflation '' program @xcite . here",
    "the superhorizon modes of the inflaton field during inflation are the system whereas all other shorter wavelength modes are the environment ; for a discussion of the validity of the semiclassical approximation , see @xcite .",
    "cosmological redshift causes a continuous streaming of modes from the environment to the system , which may be regarded as a white noise source . this noise may allow the system to hop over potential barriers , seeking the absolute minima",
    "eventually , a steady state distribution of cosmological domains is reached , not unlike that predicted by the hartle and hawking `` wave function of the universe '' @xcite .",
    "much more generally , within the semiclassical approximation the back reaction to cosmological particle creation processes always has a stochastic component @xcite , for which reason the correct semiclassical description of the early universe ought to be formulated in terms of an stochastic `` einstein - langevin '' equation @xcite .",
    "if we consider an ensemble of universes , then we may introduce a distribution function obeying a fokker - planck - like equation @xcite .",
    "this equation describes activation phenomena , which are the semiclassical version of vilenkin s `` creation from nothing '' scenario @xcite .",
    "before dealing with field theory we will consider in this section a quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) model which is typically used as a a paradigm of an open quantum system .",
    "the system has an arbitrary potential and the coupling between the system and the environment is linear in the system variables but quadratic in the environment variables .",
    "that feature will be of relevance when dealing in section [ iii ] with our field - theory model .",
    "the main result of this section is the derivation of the master equation for the reduced wigner function of the qbm model to leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "this equation turns out to be a fokker - planck equation which is similar to that used by kramers @xcite to study the activation problem in statistical physics .      as our qbm model",
    "we consider a system consisting of a particle of unit mass ( @xmath39 ) described with a variable @xmath11 and subject to an arbitrary potential with a quadratic part corresponding to an oscillator of frequency @xmath40 and an anharmonic part @xmath41 , _ i.e. _ @xmath42 , which is coupled to an environment consisting of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators with coordinates @xmath43 .",

    "there is a significant contribution to the total decay rate due to activation , even at zero temperature .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",

    "of course , the size of the bubble formed is of order @xmath1 , in our calculation this size is fixed .",
    "we can not consider smaller size regions because we could have not neglected the gradient terms of the system in front of the mass terms , also we could not have considered larger size regions because the environment modes would become unstable , their evolution would become nonlinear and our perturbative treatment of the influence functional would break down .",
    "however , the critical bubble size that one obtains in first order phase transition in statistical physics or in field theory using instanton methods is also of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "this , in our opinion , makes this computation of interest , since one expects that once the critical bubble is formed it will evolve in the usual way ; see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite . had our calculation involved a size smaller than the critical size then the bubbles formed could not grow and would collapse , as then the energy of the bubble wall would overcome the energy difference between the metastable phase and the bubble interior .",
    "another relevant point concerns the energy balance in the activation mechanism of vacuum decay described here which involves noise and dissipation . in appendix",
    "e we show that the average power exchanged between system and environment is zero : if some trajectories gain power through noise , some others lose power through dissipation .",
    "of course , the balance is only statistical , but we must stress that this gain and loss process would go on even if there were no separatrix and the system were in equilibrium .",
    "the only reason why the system does not equilibrate in our problem is that we remove those particles that reach the separatrix , as demanded by our boundary condition there .",
    "we should say that the system equilibrates but we assume that the true vacuum is very much deeper than the false vacuum , so the equilibrium distribution vanishes inside the potential well .",
    "note that this is an expected result in vacuum bubble formation .",
    "once the critical bubble is formed the energy released in the conversion from false to true vacuum is converted into energy of the growing bubble wall , so that the energy balance is still zero , this last aspect however can not be studied with the present analysis .",
