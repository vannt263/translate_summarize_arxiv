    "<S> machine learning , a branch of artificial intelligence , learns from previous experience to optimize performance , which is ubiquitous in various fields such as computer sciences , financial analysis , robotics , and bioinformatics . </S>",
    "<S> a challenge is that machine learning with the rapidly growing `` big data '' could become intractable for classical computers . </S>",
    "<S> recently , quantum machine learning algorithms [ lloyd , mohseni , and rebentrost , arxiv.1307.0411 ] were proposed which could offer an exponential speedup over classical algorithms . here , we report the first experimental entanglement - based classification of 2- , 4- , and 8-dimensional vectors to different clusters using a small - scale photonic quantum computer , which are then used to implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning . </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate the working principle of using quantum computers to manipulate and classify high - dimensional vectors , the core mathematical routine in machine learning . </S>",
    "<S> the method can in principle be scaled to larger number of qubits , and may provide a new route to accelerate machine learning .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two main types of machine learning tasks @xcite , namely supervised and unsupervised machine learning . </S>",
    "<S> in supervised machine learning , the learner is provided a set of training examples with features presented in the form of high - dimensional vectors and with corresponding labels to mark its category . the aim is to classify new examples based on these training sets . </S>",
    "<S> a simple example is a spam filter that sorts incoming emails into spam and non - spam messages by comparing the new emails with old emails already labelled by human . in unsupervised machine learning </S>",
    "<S> , the system aims to classify the data into different groups without prior information . </S>",
    "<S> an example of unsupervised machine learning is to recognize the object from a landscape background , i.e. , to classify the pixels of the image into two groups  the object and the background . </S>",
    "<S> the core mathematical task for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithm is evaluating the distance and inner products between the high - dimensional vectors to analyze the similarity between vectors , which requires a time proportional to the size of the vectors on classical computers . with rapidly growing data size in the modern world , such a task could pose a challenge even for the latest supercomputers .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been shown by lloyd , mohseni , and rebentrost @xcite that quantum computers , which are naturally good at manipulating vectors and matrices , could provide an asymptotically exponential speed - up over their classical counterparts in performing some machine learning tasks involving large vectors . </S>",
    "<S> consider the task of assigning @xmath0-dimensional vectors to one of @xmath1 clusters , each with @xmath2 representative samples , a quantum computer takes time @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential speed - up of the quantum machine learning algorithm , and its potential wide applications , may make it one of the promising applications of quantum computers @xcite , in addition to shor s factoring algorithm @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite , and the quantum algorithm for solving linear equation systems @xcite .        in this letter , we report proof - of - principle demonstrations of supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithm @xcite on a small - scale photonic quantum processor . </S>",
    "<S> the core mathematical task is to assign 2- , 4- and 8-dimensional vectors ( @xmath4 ) to two different clusters with one reference vector ( @xmath5 ) in each cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the two clusters are labelled as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , each with one reference sample vector @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . to classify the new sample which is represented by the vector @xmath10 , one common method is to calculate and compare the distance : @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the new sample is assigned to the cluster to which the distance is smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> the vectors can be represented with quantum states with a normalization factor , i.e. , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . to evaluate the distance @xmath15 , a key step in the quantum machine learning algorithm @xcite is to adjoin an ancillary qubit to the states of the reference and new vectors , creating an entangled state in the form : @xmath16    next </S>",
    "<S> , a single - qubit measurement is made on the ancillary qubit alone ( the other qubits are simply ignored ) , projecting it onto the state : @xmath17 the success probability @xmath18 of this projective measurement can be estimated by repeated measurements . remarkably , the inner product between @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be directly calculated from the @xmath18 : @xmath21 and the distance between @xmath10 and @xmath22 can then be obtained : @xmath23 it is important to note that such an estimation can achieve a desired statistical accuracy simply by a sufficient number of repeated measurements , but is _ independent _ of the size ( @xmath0 ) of the vectors , which gives a quantum speedup .    </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm can be understood intuitively ; the more different between the pure states @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the more entangled the equation @xmath24 is . for examples , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are identical , then the ancillary qubit is in the state @xmath25 , separable from the vector qubits , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are orthogonal , then the equation @xmath24 is maximally entangled , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .    in our experiment , we use single photons as qubits , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are encoded with the photon s horizontal ( @xmath32 ) and vertical ( @xmath33 ) polarization , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a schematic drawing of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig.@xmath341 . </S>",
    "<S> polarization - entangled photon pairs are generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite and prepared in the state : @xmath35 one photon ( anc ) is used as the ancillary qubit , and the other one ( vec ) will be used to encode the reference and incoming vectors using sagnac - like interferometers ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the statistical standard deviation is much smaller than the error caused by the imperfection of the entanglement state , thus error bars are omitted . </S>",
    "<S> the data is represented in polar coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to generate three- and four - photon entanglement resource state , we create two entangled photon pairs . </S>",
    "<S> two single photons , one from each pair , are temporally and spatially superposed on a polarising beam splitter ( pbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we select the events where one and only one single photon emits from each output . it can be concluded that the four photons are either all @xmath32 polarized or @xmath33 polarized , two cases that are quantum mechanically indistinguishable when all the other degrees of freedom of the photons are erased ( see the caption of fig.@xmath341 ) , thus projecting the four photons into the greenberger - horne - zeilinger entangled state @xcite : @xmath36 by projecting one of the four photons into @xmath37 , we can reduce the four - photon state ( 6 ) to three - photon entangled state : @xmath38 the two- , three- , and four - photon entangled states ( 5 - 7 ) are the entanglement resource used for the classification of the 2- , 4- and 8-dimensional vectors , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the created multi - photon entangled state using the method of entanglement witness . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the fidelity @xcite for the two- , three- and four - photon entangled states to be 0.94 , 0.73 , and 0.75 , respectively , thus prove the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath39-dimensional vector is encoded with the polarization state of @xmath40 photonic qubits . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a @xmath41-dimensional vector , ( 3.42 , 1.24 , 1.97 , 0.72 ) , is represented by the composite quantum state of two single photons with normalization , @xmath42    .experimental results for classifying four - dimensional vectors into two clusters . </S>",
    "<S> reference vector a is ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) and b is ( 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 ) . the data acquisition time is 2 minutes for each vector , collecting about 500 events . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to encoded these vectors into the entanglement resource states ( 5 - 7 ) , we send the single photons through a pbs where the photon split into two spatial modes according to its polarization . </S>",
    "<S> at the two separate spatial modes , controlled unitary operations can be implemented deterministically and independently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can transform , for instance , the two - photon entangled state ( 5 ) into @xmath43 , where the state @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be arbitrarily set using wave plates . </S>",
    "<S> the two spatial modes are then recombined on a non - polarizing beam splitter . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we create the following 2- , 3- and 4-photon entangled states in the form of eqn.@xmath34(1 ) : @xmath46 for classifying 2- , 4- and 8-dimensional vectors , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2a and 2b display theoretical prediction ( ideal ) and experimental results of entanglement - based classification of 2-dimensional vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the randomly chosen reference vectors are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , plotted in polar coordinate as blue and red rectangular cross , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for each new vector @xmath49 , @xmath50 , two - photon entangled states @xmath51 are constructed , and the distance from @xmath52 to @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) are evaluated from the success probability of the projective measurements on the ancillary photon .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference of the distances , @xmath55 , is color coded in the fill color of each data points in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a - b . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of @xmath55 dictates the result of classification : if @xmath56 , it is categorized to cluster a ( plotted as blue edge color ) ; if @xmath57 , it is categorized to cluster b ( plotted as red edge color ) . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary of the two clusters ( where @xmath58 ) is illustrated as the gray line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a - b . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that , of the 100 tested samples , two are experimentally misclassified . </S>",
    "<S> the misclassification happens for vectors close to the boundary where the absolute error ( with an average of @xmath59 ) , caused by the imperfect two - photon entanglement and dark counts of the single - photon detectors , becomes comparable to @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> similar methods can be applied to the classifications of 4- and 8-dimensional vectors based on the construction of three- and four - photon entanglement , with the experimental results listed in tables i and ii , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of distance evaluation is affected by the state fidelity ( @xmath61@xmath34@xmath62 ) of the multi - photon entangled state , which is lower compared to that of the two - photon entangled state ( @xmath61@xmath34@xmath63 ) , mainly caused by double pair emission in parametric down - conversion , the imperfect interference of independent photons on the pbs @xcite and the phase fluctuations in the sagnac interferometers . among the randomly selected 17 and 9 vectors listed in tables 1 and 2 , respectively </S>",
    "<S> , there is one sample misclassified .        </S>",
    "<S> the quantum mechanical way of evaluating the vector distance demonstrated above are the core mathematical subroutine for other machine learning tasks , for example , supervised nearest - neighbour algorithm and unsupervised machine learning algorithm . in supervised nearest - neighbor algorithm , </S>",
    "<S> each test vector is analyzed by evaluating the distance between itself and all the training vectors , and then categorized into the group of the nearest training vector . </S>",
    "<S> when new training vectors are offered , the system will adjust the judgment of classification by analyzing the distances in the new configuration . </S>",
    "<S> an example with training sample @xmath64 is shown in supplemental fig.@xmath34s1 .    in unsupervised machine learning , </S>",
    "<S> no training vectors are provided , and the system need to realize a reasonable classification by iterating to calculate the distance between different vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm includes three steps : ( 1 ) initialize a random classification . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) for each vector @xmath65 , the learner calculates the distance between @xmath65 and all vectors in a group . the @xmath65 is classified into a group to which the average distance is minimal . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) repeat step 2 until no vector needs to change its group . </S>",
    "<S> an example with @xmath66 is demonstrated in fig.@xmath343 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the current experimental scheme can in principle achieve an exponential speedup with respect to the dimension @xmath0 of the vectors , but not to the number of training samples @xmath2 . to demonstrate a speedup in numbers of manifold vectors @xmath2 , </S>",
