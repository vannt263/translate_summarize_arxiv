    "the sloan digital sky survey has recently discovered a coherent ring - like structure at low galactic latitude spanning about 100 degree in the sky and surrounding the galactic disk at galactocentric distances from @xmath0 15 kpc to @xmath0 20 kpc ( newberg et al .",
    "2002 ; yanny et al .",
    "the tremendous observational and theoretical effort to understand its origin have proven that the structural characteristic and kinematics of this stellar ring are consistent with the properties expected for the tidal stream of a merging dwarf galaxy in the galactic plane ( named the monoceros tidal stream ) .",
    "if this ring is a tidal tail feature , it must have had a parent galaxy , which may or may not be completely disrupted by now .",
    "unlike the sagittarius tidal stream , the monoceros stream has been detected prior to locating the main body of its progenitor galaxy .",
    "the best available candidate is the canis major ( cma ) dwarf galaxy , a strong elliptically shaped stellar overdensity of red giant stars discovered by martin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from an analysis of the 2mass survey . as an alternative interpretation , momany et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that this overdensity is only the signature of the galactic warp . in this paper , we address the controversy on the origin of this stellar system and its relation with the monoceros stream by answering the following questions : can we constrain the position of the progenitor galaxy with n - body simulations from the distribution and kinematics of monoceros tidal debris ? is the cma over - density the remmnat of the core of a dwarf galaxy ? and",
    "if it is , is cma the progenitor of the monoceros tidal stream ?",
    "pearrubia et al . ( 2005 ) have attempted to determine the present position of the monoceros stream progenitor through n - body simulations .",
    "these authors constrain the motion and mass of a possible progenitor by fitting the available monoceros stream detections to thousands of orbits of dwarf galaxies with different masses .",
    "this method has been proven to provide powerful constrains on the eccentricity and orbital inclination of the possible progenitor , finding that the best solutions are for a satellite galaxy moving on a low eccentric ( e=0.10 @xmath1 0.05 ) , low orbital inclination ( i=25 @xmath1 5 deg ) prograde orbit ( figure 1 ) .",
    "owing to the small area of the sky where the monoceros stream has been detected , the solutions are degenerated for some free parameters of the model : namely , the axis - ratio of the milky way halo , the mass and the present location of the stream progenitor can not be sufficiently constrained .",
    "focusing on the last point , the model reproduces the geometrical and kinematical distribution of debris if the progenitor s remnants are located within @xmath2 at heliocentric distance of @xmath014 kpc .",
    "that solution can be futher constrained with future detections in a wider range of longitudinal directions .",
    "the cma system is located at l=240 , which enters in the range obtained from n - body simulations , although at a closer distance ( @xmath38 kpc ) .",
    "the close distance of cma appears to indicate that , if this system is the progenitor of the monoceros stream , there are parts of the tidal stream at closer heliocentric distances that have not yet been detected .",
    "fig 2a shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the putative center of the cma over - density discovered by martin et al .",
    "the most remarkable feature is a narrow main - sequence ( ms ) , with a high constrast with respect to the thin / thick / halo background contamination , of which distribution is better observed in the cmd of a control field ( fig.2b ) .",
    "the cmd morphology in fig .",
    "1a is in agreement with the expected for a stellar system composed by a mean metal - rich stellar population and that has undergone at least two distinct epochs of star formation ( the last one only 1 - 2 gyr ago ) .    from the ms feature",
    ", we derive a line - of sight depth for this system of 0.9@xmath1 0.3 kpc , consistent with the interpretation of a remnant of a partially disrupted dwarf satellite ( martnez - delgado et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this limited line - of - sight depth is also very difficult to reconciled with the hypothesis of a warped galactic outer disk viewed in projection , as proposed by momany et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( see also sec . 3 ) .",
    "the derived surface brightness ( @xmath4mag ) and absolute magnitude ( @xmath5mag ) of cma places it in the category of dwarf galaxy in the known size - luminosity relation followed by dwarf galaxies ( see pasquali et al .",
    "2005 ) . additional evidence on the dwarf nature of cma from its orbital motion can be found in sec .",
    "4 . at a distance of 8 kpc , cma is the closest dwarf galaxy known .",
    "the question about whether the cma dwarf could be the progenitor of the monoceros tidal stream can not be answered without a better constrain on the motion of this posible satellite .",
    "recent absolute proper motion measurements of a sample of _ bona - fide _ cma star members ( dinescu et al . 2005 ) provide an accurate determination of the cma orbit . the orbit has a pericenter of 10@xmath10.9 kpc and an apocenter of 14 @xmath10.2 kpc . the orbit inclination is 15 @xmath13 deg and the eccentricity is 0.14@xmath1 0.04 . currently , cma is at its apocenter , and it should undergo tidal disruption .",
    "the orbital motion of the cma also provides important clues on the controversy about the origin of this stellar system ( dwarf galaxy _ versus _ galactic pertubation ) . while the cma orbit is not very dissimilar from orbits of thick disk stars , the monoceros stream stars reach a maximum distance from the galactic plane of @xmath0 2 kpc , that is larger than the thick disk scale height ( @xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "in addition , the derived w velocity component ( w=-49@xmath115 km / s ) shows significant ( 3@xmath7 ) motion perpendicular to the the disk and its negative value is inconsistent ( 7@xmath7 ) with the expected motion ( e.g. , drimmel , smart & lattanzi 2000 ) of the warp at this galactic location ( see dinescu et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the derived orbit parameters are fairly similar to those predicted in the theoretical model by pearrubia et al .",

    "3 ) for the monoceros stream s progenitor ( within 1@xmath7 ) . fig.1 shows a comparison between the best fitting n - body model ( small dots ) of the monoceros stream and the orbit of cma derived from its proper motion ( solid line ) .",
    "this agreement supports the argument that cma is the best candidate for the parent galaxy of the monoceros stream ."
