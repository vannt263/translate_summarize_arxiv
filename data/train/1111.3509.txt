    "the general aim in quantum tomography is to identify quantum states from measurement outcome statistics .",
    "a collection of observables with this property is called _ informationally complete _ @xcite . even a single observable can be informationally complete , but then it must be a noncommutative positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xcite",
    ". we will study a class of informationally complete povms in dimension @xmath0 with the minimal number of @xmath1 outcomes and we will explain how they can be implemented as sequential measurements of two @xmath0-outcome measurements .",
    "one can interpret the generated joint observable as a phase space measurement in the discrete phase space @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there are some particularly interesting approaches to finite dimensional quantum tomography , and one of them is based on complete collections of mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) @xcite . in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space",
    "one needs @xmath3 mubs in order to be able to identify all quantum states , but it is not known if a complete set of mubs exists in all dimensions .",
    "in fact , there is evidence that for @xmath4 there is no complete set of mubs @xcite .    in our scheme",
    "we start from two mutually unbiased bases connected by the finite fourier transform .",
    "they define a pair of complementary observables , which can not be measured jointly .",
    "however , it is possible to realize their joint measurement if some additional noise is allowed .",
    "we show that their joint measurement can be chosen to be informationally complete , and that this can be realized as a sequential measurement where we first perform a ` weak measurement ' in one basis and then another successive measurement in the other basis .",
    "compared to the fact that one would need @xmath3 complementary observables in order to reach informational completeness in separate measurements , it is remarkable that in the sequential scheme only two observables suffice .    the price to have a joint measurement is that the marginal observables are not the original complementary observables but their unsharp versions .",
    "we will analyze the required additional noise and characterize the optimal joint observable from this point of view .",
    "the qubit case has been first studied in @xcite , and our work generalizes those results to arbitrary finite dimension .",
    "the covariant phase space observables , i.e. , povms covariant under the finite weyl - heisenberg group , play a special role in our investigation .",
    "we prove that if a pair of conjugate observables have a joint measurement , then they also have a joint measurement which is a covariant phase space observable .",
    "since every covariant phase space observable arises from a sequential measurement of two conjugate observables @xcite , the covariant phase space observables are an outstanding choice for finite dimensional quantum tomography .",
    "the weyl - heisenberg group has also a pivotal role in the investigations of symmetric informationally complete ( sic ) observables @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that a weyl - heisenberg covariant sic observable exists in every finite dimension and their existence is numerically tested in all dimensions up to 67 @xcite .",
    "our results show that any such observable has a neat sequential realization scheme .",
    "there is an interesting difference between the even and odd dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "if we require minimal noise in both marginal observables , then their joint observable is unique .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd , then this observable is informationally complete .",
    "but if @xmath0 is even , then the joint observable is not informationally complete .",
    "this result gives an additional aspect to the common observation that quantum tomography is different in even and odd dimensions @xcite .",
    "in this section we fix some notations and introduce the basic concepts .",
    "let @xmath5 be a finite dimensional hilbert space , with @xmath6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 the vector space of all linear operators on @xmath5 .",
    "a positive operator @xmath8 having trace one is a _ state _ , and we denote by @xmath9 the set of all states .",
    "observables are generally described by _ positive operator valued measures _ ( povms ) @xcite . in this work",
    "we only consider observables with finite number of outcomes .",
    "therefore , an observable can be defined as a function @xmath10 , where each @xmath11 is a positive operator and @xmath12 . here",
    "the sum runs over all @xmath13 , where the set @xmath14 is the collection of all possible measurement outcomes .",
    "if a system is prepared in a state @xmath15 , then a measurement of an observable @xmath16 will lead to an outcome @xmath17 with the probability @xmath18}$ ] .",
    "an observable @xmath16 is _ informationally complete _ if its measurement outcome probability distribution is sufficient to identify a unique state @xcite . in other words",
    ", two different states must give rise to different probability distributions : for all pairs of states @xmath19 , @xmath20 } = { { \\rm tr}\\left[\\varrho_2 { \\mathsf{a}}(j)\\right ] } \\quad \\forall j\\in\\omega_{\\mathsf{a}}\\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\\varrho_1=\\varrho_2 \\ , .\\ ] ]    the informational completeness of an observable @xmath16 is equivalent to the property that the linear span of the set @xmath21 is @xmath7 @xcite .      given two observables @xmath16 and @xmath22 , we say that they are _ jointly measurable _ if there exists a third observable @xmath23 with @xmath24 and satisfying @xmath25 in other words , @xmath16 and @xmath22 correspond to the ` marginals ' of @xmath23 .",
    "any observable satisfying is called a _ joint observable _ of @xmath16 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we recall that joint measurability is equivalent to the following @xcite : there exists an observable @xmath26 and stochastic matrices @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 $ ] such that @xmath29 hence , two observables are jointly measurable iff they can be ` post - processed ' from a single observable .",
    "we will use several times the following simple fact : if @xmath23 and @xmath30 are joint observables of @xmath16 and @xmath22 , then also all their convex combinations @xmath31 , @xmath32 , are joint observables of @xmath16 and @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that two jointly measurable observables have either a unique joint observable or infinitely many of them .",
    "another useful fact is related to unitary transformations .",
    "let @xmath33 be a unitary operator on @xmath5 .",
    "two observables @xmath16 and @xmath22 are jointly measurable if and only if the observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 are jointly measurable .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that @xmath23 is a joint observable of @xmath16 and @xmath22 if and only if @xmath36 is a joint observable of @xmath34 and @xmath37 .",
    "an observable describes the statistics of the outcomes of a measurement but leaves open how the measurement disturbs the input state . in order to discuss this",
    "we need the concept of an _ instrument _ @xcite .",
    "an instrument with finitely many outcomes is a mapping @xmath38 such that each @xmath39 is a completely positive linear map on @xmath7 and @xmath40}=1 $ ] for all states @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath41 of @xmath39 is defined via the usual trace duality @xmath42}={{\\rm tr}\\left[{\\mathcal{i}}_x^\\ast(s)t\\right ] } \\qquad \\forall s , t\\in{\\mathcal{l(h)}}\\ , .\\ ] ] in other words , @xmath41 and @xmath39 correspond to the heisenberg and schrdinger pictures , respectively .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 is an observable .",
    "then we say that an instrument @xmath43 is _",
    "@xmath16-compatible _ if @xmath44 for every @xmath17 .",
    "every @xmath16-compatible instrument describes some particular kind of measurement of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "an example of an @xmath16-compatible instrument is the _",
    "lders instrument _ @xmath45 , defined by @xmath46 any other @xmath16-compatible instrument @xmath43 is of the form @xmath47 for some collection @xmath48 of completely positive trace preserving maps on @xmath7 @xcite .      by a _",
    "sequential measurement _ we mean a setting where two measurements are combined into a third measurement by performing them one after the other @xcite . generally , the order in which the measurements are performed is crucial @xcite .",
    "suppose we have two @xmath49-outcome observables @xmath50 and we measure them subsequently ; first @xmath16 and then @xmath22 . as a result",
    ", we have in total @xmath51 possible measurement outcomes . generally , we do not obtain a joint measurement of @xmath16 and @xmath22 since the first measurement distrubs the input state .",
    "in fact , the overall measurement depends on the way we measure @xmath16 .",
    "if the first measurement is described by an @xmath16-compatible instrument @xmath43 , then the overall observable @xmath23 is given by @xmath52 } = { { \\rm tr}\\left[{\\mathsf{b}}(k){\\mathcal{i}}_j(\\varrho)\\right]}\\ ] ] for all input states @xmath15 , or equivalently , @xmath53 let us notice that first marginal of @xmath23 is always @xmath16 , while the second marginal is a perturbed version of @xmath22 and depends on the instrument @xmath43 .",
    "we start with a preliminary example , which is mainly a collection of well known facts .",
    "it hints the forthcoming developments and clarifies the aims of the later sections .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details and further references .",
    "fix @xmath56 , and let @xmath16 and @xmath22 be the two observables corresponding to the measurements of spin-@xmath57 components in the directions @xmath17 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the pauli spin matrices .    since @xmath16 and @xmath22 consist of projections and they do not mutually commute , it is not possible to measure them jointly .",
    "moreover , if we measure them separately on two similarly prepared ensembles , we still can not infer the unknown state .",
    "an alternative way is to perform a sequential measurement .",
    "the first measurement has to be a weak measurement , meaning that we do not measure @xmath16 but its unsharp version .",
    "we define an unsharp version @xmath61 of @xmath16 by @xmath62 here @xmath63 $ ] is a parameter quantifying the noise or imprecision .",
    "we can write @xmath61 in the form @xmath64 in a similar way we define an unsharp version @xmath65 of @xmath22 by @xmath66    we want to study the disturbance of the first measurement on the system , and for this reason we define an instrument related to @xmath61 . a class of @xmath61-compatible instruments can be defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 are arbitrary unitary operators .",
    "if the subsequent measurement is a @xmath22-measurement , then the overall statistics of the sequential measurement is given by the observable @xmath69 the properties of @xmath23 obviously depend on @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the following we consider two different choices of @xmath72 .",
    "if we choose @xmath73 , then we obtain @xmath74 in particular , the marginals are @xmath75 the joint observable @xmath23 is an optimal approximate joint measurement of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the unsharp parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 saturate the inequality @xmath78 indeed , it is known that this inequality is a necessary and sufficient criterion for two observables @xmath61 and @xmath65 to be jointly measurable @xcite .",
    "let us also notice that the joint observable of @xmath61 and @xmath65 is unique if @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "another interesting option is to choose @xmath80 for some fixed angle @xmath81 . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath82 and the marginals are @xmath83    it is easy to see that the linear span of the four operators @xmath84 , @xmath85 , is the set of all @xmath86 - complex matrices .",
    "it follows that the joint observable @xmath23 is informationally complete .    the unsharpness parameters @xmath76 and @xmath87 do not saturate the inequality . altering the parameter @xmath88 we can make the sum @xmath89 as close to @xmath90 as we want ,",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath61 and @xmath65 admit an informationally complete joint observable if and only if @xmath91    finally , we remark that with the choices @xmath92 and @xmath93 the joint observable @xmath23 is a symmetric informationally complete ( sic ) observable .",
    "we start by recalling the usual definition of complementary observables in a finite @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space and some related basic facts @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath96 be _ mutually unbiased bases _ ( mubs ) , i.e. , they are orthonormal bases in @xmath5 and @xmath97 we define two @xmath0-outcome observables @xmath16 and @xmath22 corresponding to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath98 obviously , two orthonormal bases @xmath95 and @xmath99 define the same observable @xmath16 iff @xmath100 for some complex numbers @xmath101 of modulus one",
    ".    the mutual unbiasedness condition can be rephrased by saying that @xmath16 and @xmath22 are _ complementary _ observables , meaning that in any state @xmath15 where the outcome of @xmath16 is predictable , the @xmath22-distribution is uniform ( and vice versa ) .",

    "there is a canonical way to produce two mutually unbiased bases . in the following ,",
    "suppose an orthonormal basis @xmath106 of @xmath5 is fixed .",
    "denoting @xmath107 , we define the following unitary representations @xmath33 and @xmath108 of the cyclic group @xmath109 in @xmath5 : @xmath110 for all @xmath111 . in the above formulas and in the rest of the paper , addition and multiplication of elements in @xmath109",
    "are understood modulo @xmath0 .",

    "it is easy to verify that @xmath113    the fourier transform ( with respect to the basis @xmath106 ) is the unitary operator @xmath114 defined by @xmath115 the adjoint operator @xmath116 of @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 and we have @xmath119 .",
    "we denote @xmath120 and it is immediate to check that @xmath121 and @xmath96 are mubs , with @xmath122 .",
    "the fourier transform has the intertwining properties @xmath123 from which it follows that @xmath124    the observables @xmath16 and @xmath22 related to @xmath121 and @xmath96 , respectively , satisfy the following conditions for all @xmath125 : @xmath126 and @xmath127 in other words , @xmath16 is @xmath33-covariant and @xmath108-invariant , while @xmath22 is @xmath33-invariant and @xmath108-covariant .",

    "it is customary to say that @xmath16 and @xmath22 are _ canonically conjugated _ observables .",
    "the conditions  are analogous to the symmetry properties of the usual position and momentum observables on the real line @xmath130 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in some situations the covariance properties may have some physical meaning or motivation .",
    "however , for our purposes they are just useful features that can be utilized later in our calculations .      measurements of two complementary observables are incompatible and therefore have to be performed separately .",
    "this means that their measurements require different settings .",
    "however , it is possible to perform a simultaneous measurement of two complementary observables if we allow some additional imprecision or noise .",
