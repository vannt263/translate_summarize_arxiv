    "<S> while there are , in principle , many different color - superconducting phases , corresponding to the different possibilities to form quark cooper pairs , the ground state of color - superconducting quark matter is the so - called color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite .    at asymptotically large @xmath1 , the qcd coupling constant @xmath2 , thus </S>",

    "<S> the quark loop is @xmath3 , while the gluon loops are @xmath4 . since the color - superconducting gap parameter is @xmath5 @xcite , and since the transition temperature to the normal conducting phase is @xmath6 , for temperatures where quark matter is in the color - superconducting phase , @xmath7 less than @xmath8 , the gluon loop contribution can be neglected . </S>",
