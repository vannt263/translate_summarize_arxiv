    "there are a number of recognised criteria for measuring the quality of a drawing of a given graph .",
    "these include :    * no two edges should cross in drawings of planar graphs ; * the edges should be drawn as straight line - segments ; and * the drawing should have large _ angular resolution _ ( defined to be the minimum angle determined by two consecutive edges incident to a vertex ) .",
    "these three criteria are adopted in the present paper .",
    "more formally , a ( _ straight - line general position _ ) _ drawing _ of graph @xmath0 is an injective function @xmath11 such that the points @xmath12 are not collinear for all distinct vertices @xmath13 .",
    "the _ image _ of an edge @xmath14 under @xmath15 is the line segment @xmath16 . where no confusion is caused",
    ", we henceforth do not distinguish between a graph element and its image in a drawing .",
    "two edges _ cross _ if they intersect at a point other than a common endpoint .",
    "our focus is on drawings of trees . here",
    "a number of other criteria have been studied that will not be considered in this paper .",
    "these include : small bounding box area @xcite , small aspect ratio @xcite , few bends in the edges @xcite , few distinct edge - slopes @xcite , few distinct edge - lengths @xcite , layered vertices @xcite , upwardness in rooted trees @xcite , and maximising symmetry @xcite .",
    "a _ minimum spanning tree _ of a finite set @xmath17 , denoted by @xmath18 , is a straight - line drawing of a tree with vertex set @xmath19 and with minimum total edge length ; see figure  [ fig : mst ] for an example .",
    "a drawing of a given ( abstract ) tree that is a minimum spanning tree of its vertex set is considered to be particularly aesthetically pleasing .",
    "in particular , every minimum spanning tree is crossing - free and has angular resolution at least @xmath20 .",
    "drawings defined in this way are called ` proximity drawings ' ; see section  [ sec : treedrawing ] and @xcite for more on proximity drawings .",
    "example of a minimum spanning tree . ]",
    "@xcite proved that every degree-@xmath21 tree can be drawn as a minimum spanning tree of its vertex set , and they provided a linear time ( real ram ) algorithm to compute the drawing . in any drawing of a vertex @xmath1 with degree at least @xmath22 ,",
    "some angle at @xmath1 is greater than @xmath20 , and the same is true for a degree-@xmath23 vertex if the points are required to be in general position .",
    "thus a tree that contains a vertex with degree at least @xmath22 can not be drawn as a minimum spanning tree , and the same is true for a degree-@xmath23 vertex if the points are in general position .",
    "if collinear vertices are allowed , then @xcite showed that it is np - hard to decide whether a given degree-@xmath23 tree can be drawn as a minimum spanning tree . in this sense , the problem of testing whether a tree can be drawn as a minimum spanning tree is essentially solved .",
    "( in related work , @xcite characterised those trees that have drawings that are voronoi diagrams of their vertex set . )",
    "what can be said about drawings of a high degree tree @xmath24 that ` approximate ' the minimum spanning tree of the vertex set ?",
    "we prove the following solutions to this question based on partitions of @xmath24 into subtrees of bounded degree .",
    "a _ partition _ of a graph @xmath0 is a set of subgraphs of @xmath0 such that every edge of @xmath0 is in exactly one subgraph .",
    "a partition can also be thought of as a ( non - proper ) edge - colouring , with one colour for each subgraph .",
    "we emphasise that ` trees ' and ` subtrees ' are necessarily connected .",
    "[ thm : degree5partition - mst ] let @xmath25  be a partition of a tree @xmath24 into degree-@xmath21 subtrees . then there is a drawing of @xmath24 such that each subtree in @xmath25  is drawn as the minimum spanning tree of its vertex set .",
    "the drawing of @xmath24 produced by theorem  [ thm : degree5partition - mst ] possibly has crossings , which are undesirable .",
    "the next result eliminates the crossings , at the expense of a slightly stronger assumption about the partition , which is expressed in terms of rooted trees . a _ rooted tree _ is a directed tree such that exactly one vertex , called the _ root _ , has indegree @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that every vertex except @xmath27 has indegree @xmath28 , and every edge @xmath29 of @xmath24 is oriented ` away ' from @xmath27 ; that is , if @xmath1 is closer to @xmath27 than @xmath30 , then @xmath29 is directed from @xmath1 to @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a vertex of a tree @xmath24 , then the pair @xmath31 denotes the rooted tree obtained by orienting every edge of @xmath24 away from @xmath27 .",
    "[ thm : degree4partition - mst ] let @xmath25  be a partition of a rooted tree @xmath24 into outdegree-@xmath32 subtrees . then there is a non - crossing drawing of @xmath24 such that each subtree in @xmath25  is drawn as the minimum spanning tree of its vertex set .    by further restricting the partition we introduce large angular resolution as an additional property of the drawing , again at the expense of a slightly stronger assumption about the partition .",
    "[ thm : degree3partition - mst ] let @xmath25  be a partition of a rooted tree @xmath24 into outdegree-@xmath33 subtrees .",
    "then there is a non - crossing drawing of @xmath24 with angular resolution at least @xmath34 such that each subtree in @xmath25  is drawn as the minimum spanning tree of its vertex set .",
    "since every drawing of @xmath24 has angular resolution at most @xmath35 , the bound on the angular resolution in theorem  [ thm : degree3partition - mst ] is within a constant factor of optimal .",
    "our final drawing theorem concerns a given covering of a tree by two bounded degree subtrees .",
    "a _ covering _ of a graph @xmath0 is a set of connected subgraphs of @xmath0 such that every edge of @xmath0 is in at least one subgraph .",

    "a number of notes about theorems  [ thm : degree5partition - mst][thm : twocovering - mst ] are in order :    * each of theorems  [ thm : degree5partition - mst ] , [ thm : degree4partition - mst ] and [ thm : twocovering - mst ] imply and generalise the above - mentioned result by @xcite that every degree-@xmath21 tree @xmath24 can be drawn as a minimum spanning tree of its vertex set .",

    "the above theorems are loosely related to the notion of geometric thickness .",
    "the _ geometric thickness _ of a graph @xmath0 is the minimum integer @xmath41 such that there is a straight - line drawing of @xmath0 and an edge @xmath41-colouring such that monochromatic edges do not cross ; see @xcite .",
    "thus in the drawing of @xmath0 , the subgraph induced by each colour class is crossing - free .",
    "the above theorems also produce drawings in which the edges are partitioned into non - crossing subgraph , but with additional proximity properties .",
    "moreover , each subgraph of the partition is connected , which intuitively at least , is a desirable property in visualisation applications . *",
