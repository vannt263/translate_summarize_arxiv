    "during the last decade , there have been many developments in the construction and analysis of low - complexity error - correcting codes which closely approach the shannon capacity limit of many standard communication channels with feasible complexity .",
    "these codes are understood to be codes defined on graphs , together with the associated iterative decoding algorithms .",
    "graphs serve not only to describe the codes themselves , but more importantly , they structure the operation of their efficient sub - optimal iterative decoding algorithms",
    ".    proper design of codes defined on graphs enables to asymptotically achieve the capacity of the binary erasure channel ( bec ) under iterative message - passing decoding .",
    "capacity - achieving sequences of ensembles of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes were originally introduced by shokrollahi @xcite and by luby et al .",
    "@xcite , and a systematic study of capacity - achieving sequences of ldpc ensembles was presented by oswald and shokrollahi @xcite for the bec .",
    "analytical bounds on the maximal achievable rates of ldpc ensembles were derived by barak et al .",
    "@xcite for the asymptotic case where the block length tends to infinity ; this analysis provides a lower bound on the gap between the channel capacity and the achievable rates of ldpc ensembles under iterative decoding .",
    "the decoding complexity of ldpc codes under iterative message - passing decoding scales linearly with the block length , though their encoding complexity is in general super - linear with the block length ; this motivated the introduction of repeat - accumulate codes and their more recent variants ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) whose encoding and decoding complexities under iterative message - passing decoding are both inherently linear with the block length . due to the simplicity of the density evolution analysis for the bec ,",
    "suitable constructions of capacity - achieving ensembles of variants of repeat - accumulate codes were devised in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all these works rely on the density evolution analysis of codes defined on graphs for the bec , and provide an asymptotic analysis which refers to the case where we let the block length of these code ensembles tend to infinity .",
    "another innovative coding technique , introduced by shokrollahi @xcite , enables to achieve the capacity of the bec with encoding and decoding complexities which scale linearly with the block length , and it has the additional pleasing property of achieving the capacity without the knowledge of the erasure probability of the channel .    the performance analysis of finite - length ldpc code ensembles whose transmission takes place over the bec was introduced by di et al .",
    "this analysis considers sub - optimal iterative message - passing decoding as well as optimal maximum - likelihood decoding . in @xcite , an efficient approach to the design of ldpc codes of finite length",
    "was introduced by amraoui et al . ; this approach is specialized for the bec , and it enables to design such code ensembles which perform well under iterative decoding with a practical constraint on the block length . in @xcite , richardson and",
    "urbanke initiated the analysis of the distribution of the number of iterations needed for the decoding of ldpc ensembles of finite block length which are communicated over the bec .    for general channels ,",
    "the number of iterations is an important factor in assessing the decoding complexity of graph - based codes under iterative message - passing decoding .",
    "the second factor determining the decoding complexity of such codes is the complexity of the tanner graph which is used to represent the code ; this latter quantity , defined as the number of edges in the graph per information bit , serves as a measure for the decoding complexity per iteration .",
    "the extrinsic information transfer ( exit ) charts , pioneered by stephan ten brink @xcite , form a powerful tool for an efficient design of codes defined on graphs by tracing the convergence behavior of their iterative decoders .",
    "exit charts provide a good approximative engineering tool for tracing the convergence behavior of soft - input soft - output iterative decoders ; they suggest a simplified visualization of the convergence of these decoding algorithms , based on a single parameter which represents the exchange of extrinsic information between the constituent decoders . for the bec ,",
    "the exit charts coincide with the density evolution analysis ( see @xcite ) which is simplified in this case to a one - dimensional analysis .",
    "a numerical approach for the joint optimization of the design rate and decoding complexity of ldpc ensembles was provided in @xcite ; it is assumed there that the transmission of these code ensembles takes place over a memoryless binary - input output - symmetric ( mbios ) channel , and the analysis refers to the asymptotic case where we let the block length tend to infinity .",
    "for the simplification of the numerical optimization , a suitable approximation of the number of iterations was used in @xcite to formulate this joint optimization as a convex optimization problem . due to the efficient tools which currently exist for a numerical solution of convex optimization problems ,",
    "this approach suggests an engineering tool for the design of good ldpc ensembles which possess an attractive tradeoff between the decoding complexity and the asymptotic gap to capacity ( where the block length of these code ensembles is large enough ) .",
    "this numerical approach however is not amenable for drawing rigorous theoretical conclusions on the tradeoff between the number of iterations and the performance of the code ensembles .",
    "a different numerical approach for approximating the number of iterations for ldpc ensembles operating over the bec is addressed in @xcite .",
    "a different approach for characterizing the complexity of iterative decoders was suggested by khandekar and mceliece ( see @xcite ) .",
    "their questions and conjectures were related to the tradeoff between the asymptotic achievable rates and the complexity under iterative message - passing decoding ; they initiated a study of the encoding and decoding complexity of graph - based codes in terms of the achievable gap ( in rate ) to capacity .",
    "it was conjectured there that for a large class of channels , if the design rate of a suitably designed ensemble forms a fraction @xmath0 of the channel capacity , then the decoding complexity scales like @xmath1 .",
    "the logarithmic term in this expression was attributed to the graphical complexity ( i.e. , the decoding complexity per iteration ) , and the number of iterations was conjectured to scale like @xmath2 .",
    "there is one exception : for the bec , the complexity under the iterative message - passing decoding algorithm behaves like @xmath3 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is true since the absolute reliability provided by the bec allows every edge in the graph to be used only once during the iterative decoding .",
    "hence , for the bec , the number of iterations performed by the decoder serves mainly to measure the delay in the decoding process , while the decoding complexity is closely related to the complexity of the tanner graph which is chosen to represent the code . the graphical complexity required for ldpc and systematic irregular repeat - accumulate ( ira ) code ensembles to achieve a fraction @xmath0 of the capacity of a bec under iterative decoding",
    "was studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was shown in these papers that the graphical complexity of these ensembles must scale at least like @xmath4 ; moreover , some explicit constructions were shown to approach the channel capacity with such a scaling of the graphical complexity .",
    "an additional degree of freedom which is obtained by introducing state nodes in the graph ( e.g. , punctured bits ) was exploited in @xcite and @xcite to construct capacity - achieving ensembles of graph - based codes which achieve an improved tradeoff between complexity and achievable rates .",
    "surprisingly , these capacity - achieving ensembles under iterative decoding were demonstrated to maintain a _ bounded graphical complexity _ regardless of the erasure probability of the bec .",
    "a similar result of a bounded graphical complexity for capacity - achieving ensembles over the bec was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "this paper provides simple lower bounds on the number of iterations which is required for successful message - passing decoding of graph - based code ensembles .",
    "the transmission of these ensembles is assumed to take place over the bec , and the bounds refer to the asymptotic case where the block length tends to infinity .",
    "the simplicity of the bounds derived in this paper stems from the fact that they are easily evaluated and are expressed in terms of some basic parameters of the considered ensemble ; these include the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes , the target bit erasure probability and the gap between the channel capacity and the design rate of the ensemble .",
    "the bounds derived in this paper demonstrate that the number of iterations which is required for successful message - passing decoding scales at least like the inverse of the gap ( in rate ) to capacity , provided that the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes of these turbo - like ensembles does not vanish ( hence , the number of iterations becomes unbounded as the gap to capacity vanishes ) .",
    "the behavior of these lower bounds matches well with the experimental results and the conjectures on the number of iterations and complexity , as provided by khandekar and mceliece ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "note that lower bounds on the number of iterations in terms of the target bit erasure probability can be alternatively viewed as lower bounds on the achievable bit erasure probability as a function of the number of iterations performed by the decoder . as a result of this ,",
    "the simple bounds derived in this paper provide some insight on the design of stopping criteria for iteratively decoded ensembles over the bec ( for other stopping criteria see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section  [ section : preliminaries ] presents some preliminary background , definitions and notation , section  [ section : main results ] introduces the main results of this paper and discusses some of their implications , the proofs of these statements and some further discussions are provided in section  [ section : proofs of main results ] .",
    "finally , section  [ section : summary and conclusions ] summarizes this paper .",
    "proofs of some technical statements are relegated to the appendices .",
    "this section provides preliminary background and introduces notation for the rest of this paper .",
    "as noted in section  [ section : introduction ] , the decoding complexity of a graph - based code under iterative message - passing decoding is closely related to its graphical complexity , which we now define formally .",

    "denote the number of edges in @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "the graphical complexity of @xmath8 is defined as the number of edges in @xmath8 per information bit of the code @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath10 . _    note that the graphical complexity depends on the specific tanner graph which is used to represent the code .",
    "an analysis of the graphical complexity for some families of graph - based codes is provided in @xcite .      accumulate - repeat - accumulate ( ara ) codes form an attractive coding scheme of turbo - like codes due to the simplicity of their encoding and decoding ( where both scale linearly with the block length ) , and due to their remarkable performance under iterative decoding @xcite . by some suitable constructions of puncturing patterns , ara codes with small maximal node degree",
    "are presented in @xcite ; these codes perform very well even for short to moderate block lengths , and they suggest flexibility in the design of efficient rate - compatible codes operating on the same ara decoder",
    ".    ensembles of irregular and systematic ara codes , which asymptotically achieve the capacity of the bec with bounded graphical complexity , are presented in @xcite .",
    "this bounded complexity result stays in contrast to ldpc ensembles , which have been shown to require unbounded graphical complexity in order to approach channel capacity , even under maximum - likelihood decoding ( see @xcite ) . in this section , we present ensembles of irregular and systematic ara codes , and give a short overview of their encoding and decoding algorithms ; this overview is required for the later discussion .",
    "the material contained in this section is taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  ii ) , and is introduced here briefly in order to make the paper self - contained .    from an encoding point of view , ara codes are viewed as interleaved and serially concatenated codes .",
    "the encoding of ara codes is done as follows : first , the information bits are accumulated ( i.e. , differentially encoded ) , and then the bits are repeated a varying number of times ( by an irregular repetition code ) and interleaved .",
    "the interleaved bits are partitioned into disjoint sets ( whose size is not fixed in general ) , and the parity of each set of bits is computed ( i.e. , the bits are passed through an irregular single parity - check ( spc ) code ) . finally , the bits are accumulated a second time .",
    "a codeword of systematic ara codes is composed of the information bits and the parity bits at the output of the second accumulator .    since the iterative decoding algorithm of ara codes is performed on the appropriate tanner graph ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : ara tanner graph ] ) , this leads one to view them as sparse - graph codes from a decoding point of view .",
    "following the notation in @xcite , we refer to the three layers of bit nodes in the tanner graphs as ` systematic bits ' which form the systematic part of the codeword , ` punctured bits ' which correspond to the output of the first accumulator and are not a part of the transmitted codeword , and ` code bits ' which correspond to the output of the second accumulator and form the parity - bits of the codeword ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : ara tanner graph ] ) . denoting the block length of the code by @xmath6 and its dimension by @xmath11 , each codeword",
    "is composed of @xmath11 systematic bits and @xmath12 code bits .",
    "the two layers of check nodes are referred to as ` parity - check  1 ' nodes and ` parity - check  2 ' nodes , which correspond to the first and the second accumulators of the encoder , respectively .",
    "an ensemble of irregular ara codes is defined by the block length @xmath6 and the degree distributions of the ` punctured bit ' and ` parity - check  2 ' nodes . following the notation in @xcite , the degree distribution of the ` punctured bit ' nodes",

    "degree of a node only refers to edges connecting the ` punctured bit ' and the ` parity - check  2 ' layers , without the extra two edges which are connected to each of the ` punctured bit ' nodes and ` parity - check  2 ' nodes from the accumulators ( see fig .",

    "the design rate of a systematic ara ensemble is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 designate the average degrees of the ` punctured bit ' and ` parity - check  2 ' nodes , respectively .",
    "iterative decoding of ara codes is performed by passing messages on the edges of the tanner graph in a layer - by - layer approach .",
    "each decoding iteration starts with messages for the ` systematic bit ' nodes to the ` parity - check  1 ' nodes , the latter nodes then use this information to calculate new messages to the ` punctured bit ' nodes and so the information passes through layers down the graph and back up until the iteration ends with messages from the ` punctured bit ' nodes to the ` parity - check  1 ' nodes .",
    "the final phase of messages from the ` parity - check  1 ' nodes to the ` systematic bit ' nodes is omitted since the latter nodes are of degree one and so the outgoing message is not changed by incoming information .",
    "assume that the code is transmitted over a bec with erasure probability @xmath23 . since the systematic bits receive input from the channel , the probability of erasure in messages from the ` systematic bit ' nodes to the ` parity - check  1 ' nodes is equal to @xmath23 throughout the decoding process .",
