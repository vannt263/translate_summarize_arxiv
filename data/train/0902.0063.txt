    "we study the physical properties of the hot and dense fireball , and in particular , the thermal pressure at time of hadronization . in our approach , we consider that at rhic , as well as at the top sps energies , a local domain of thermally colliding gluons and quarks has been formed , the quark  gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in the early stages of the collision a high density , and thus pressure buildup occurs which is followed by a fast relativistic collective matter outflow .",
    "this system expansion dilutes the density beyond phase equilibrium transformation to hadron gas ( hg ) .",
    "this sub - dense system is unstable and can experience a sudden breakup , converting rapidly from quarks into hadrons , with free streaming particles , only ` strong ' hadron resonances are subject to possible further interactions .",
    "however , this does not alter the final stable particle yields .",
    "thus , fitting the yields of particles using the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) , we can infer from the measured hadronic particle yields also the yields of other unmeasured hadrons . summing the contributions of many gas fractions ,",
    "we obtain the physical conditions of the fireball .",
    "in such a procedure , it is necessary to allow for greatest possible flexibility in characterization of particle phase space , consistent with conservation laws and related physical constraints of qgp breakup . in particular , the qgp yield of strange and light quark pairs has to be nearly preserved while qgp particles are distributed into final state hadrons .",
    "this is accomplished using parameters which describe the quark pair yields , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . while these parameters in both phases are not equal , i.e. , @xmath4 , the yield of pairs are similar , i.e. , @xmath5 , provided that the qgp breakup process is rapid , and that is seen in the hbt data .",
    "a value of @xmath6 allows to control the density of particles at given temperature , but unlike the chemical potential , @xmath7 acts in the same direction for particles and conjugate ( anti ) particles .",
    "how this works will become clear in next section .",
    "a jump - up in the phase space occupancy parameter @xmath2 replaces an increase in volume associated with a slow re - equilibrating hadronization with mixed phase , a reaction picture incompatible with many reaction observables , including hbt . the rise in occupancy ,",
    "just like the rise in the volume size needed when chemical equilibrium @xmath8 is assumed , accommodates transformation of a entropy dense qgp phase into entropy dilute hg phase .",
    "similarly , a jump - up in the strangeness phase space occupancy parameter @xmath9 allows for higher density of strangeness in qgp compared to hg .",
    "we have , in general , @xmath10    the available number of quark pairs in qgp at hadronization decisively influences the possibility to form baryons .",
    "in fact , the _ ratio _ of baryon to meson yield arising in microscopic dynamics of hadronization is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this establishes the necessity to include the occupancy parameters in order to describe the yields of hadrons , since this is the parameter which allows for a hadronization dependent dynamical relative yield of mesons and baryons .",
    "conversely , a study of particle yields with a fixed light quark equilibrium value @xmath11 presumes that the relative yield of baryons to mesons is fully chemically equilibrated , and that we know well the spectrum of hadrons .",
    "clearly , neither assumption is safe and the choice @xmath11 is over - constraining any hadronization model , as of course is the choice @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis of experimental hadron yield results requires a significant book - keeping and fitting effort in order to allow for resonances , particle widths , full decay trees and isospin multiplet sub - states . a program share ( statistical hadronization with resonances ) suitable to perform this data analysis is available for public use  @xcite .",
    "this program implements the pdg  @xcite confirmed ( 4-star ) set of particles and resonances , and we use  @xcite already for two years the modern @xmath13-meson mass  @xcite ( @xmath14 mev ) .",
    "the important parameters of the shm , which control the relative yields of particles , are the particle specific fugacity factors @xmath15 and the space occupancy factors @xmath16 discussed above .",
    "the fugacity is related to chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "the occupancy @xmath16 is , nearly , the ratio of produced particles to the number of particle expected in chemical equilibrium , and thus , meson yield is ( nearly ) proportional to @xmath18 and baryon yield to @xmath19 ( here , we did not distinguish the valance quark content for @xmath20 quarks ) .",
    "the actual formula for the momentum distribution is , both for the hg and qgp phase : @xmath21 where the boltzmann limit of the fermi ` @xmath22 ' and bose ` @xmath23 ' distributions , applicable , in particular when @xmath24 , is indicated .",
    "@xmath25 is the degeneracy factor , @xmath26 is the temperature and @xmath27 is the single particle energy spectrum , typically @xmath28 .",
    "the fugacity @xmath15 is associated with a conserved quantum number , such as net - baryon number , net - strangeness or heavy flavor .",
    "thus , antiparticles have inverse value of @xmath15 , and @xmath15 evolution during the reaction process is related to the changes in densities due to dynamics , such as expansion .",
    "contrary to @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the same for particles and antiparticles .",
    "its value changes as a function of time , even if the system does not expand , for it describes buildup in time of the particular particle species . for this reason , @xmath16 changes rapidly during the reaction , while @xmath15 is more constant .",
    "it is @xmath16 which carries the information about the time history of the reaction and the precise condition of particle production referred to as chemical freeze - out .    in the quark phase",
    ", each particle has its proper chemical yield co - factor , thus for light quarks @xmath29 , we have yield co - factors @xmath30 , and for antiquarks @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 , and similarly for strange quarks @xmath33 and antiquarks @xmath34 . in the hg phase , we need to count valance quark content of each hadron .",
    "for example , for the @xmath35 , the chemical co - factor is @xmath36 , while for @xmath37 , it is @xmath38 .",
    "we recall that the chemical potentials of baryon number , @xmath39 , and hyperon number , @xmath40 , are @xmath41 where , for historical reasons , hyperon number has opposite quantum number to strangeness .",
    "above and from now on , when the upper index is absent the ( chemical ) variable considered refers to the final state phase , thus to hg .",
    "share allows the conservation of ( electrical ) charge @xmath42 , which is done at the cost of introducing the fugacity @xmath43 and we note , in this context , that @xmath44 .",
    "we evaluate the success of our data fit considering the profile of @xmath45 as function of @xmath2 .",
    "( see top of figure  [ chip ] ) , on left for ags ",
    "sps energy range , and on right for rhic .",
    "the best fit is clearly not obtained at @xmath46 note that for a small number of dof , the value of @xmath45 can be very misleading , for this reason the bottom frames in figure  [ chip ] show the confidence level @xmath47 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath47 is explained in `` review of particle physics ''  @xcite where we see , in figure  32.2 , lines of fixed value of @xmath48 , for given values @xmath49 and dof .",
    "note that the value @xmath50 is equivalent to @xmath51 for the case that very many dof are present .",
    "however , for a small number of dof , a very much smaller value of @xmath49 must be achieved to claim good confidence fit",
    ". only @xmath52 , and not @xmath49 , expresses confidence in the validity of the model used to fit the data .",
    "effectively , @xmath52 also expresses confidence in the data , provided that we believe in the model .",
    "this is easily recognized by checking what happens when we intentionally alter an experimental data point , e.g. , by 2 s.d .. we find that our data fit remains stable in the sense that we find nearly the same model parameters , but @xmath48 becomes much smaller , and the falsified data point contributes dominantly to the error of the fit .    at sps ( left side , bottom frame of figure  [ chip ] ) , our fits , carried out with the na49 2008 data set ,",
    "converge to a common best value @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "this value has somewhat higher @xmath48 than one should expect on statistical grounds ( 50% ) .",
    "however , we have treated systematic errors as if these were statistical errors , and have added these linearly to the statistical errors , in effect making many measurement errors too large . on the right hand side , in figure [ chip ] , we see rhic results .",
    "it seems that for @xmath54 and 130 gev , the confidence level is here too high , suggesting that the combination of statistical errors with systematic errors was not appropriate ( our , here presented , 62 gev fit comprises some extrapolated and interpolated results and should not be seen as yet to be a ` real ' data fit ) .",
    "the data sets for ags  sps study were presented elsewhere  @xcite , the study of total ( as opposed to @xmath55 ) hadron yields at rhic is relying on extrapolations , and the discussion of this matter goes beyond the scope of this presentation . in table  [ rhic ] , we show the in  out data fields for the fits to central rapidity 200 , 130 and 62.4 gev at rhic , as used here .",
    "as seen in table [ rhic ] , we combine phenix data for direct single particle spectra with rhic date for ( strange ) particles yields reconstructed from the decay particles using , e.g. , the invariant mass method  @xcite , a more complete discussion of our data set goes beyond the scope of this report , see also  @xcite .    .",
    "[ rhic ] the constrains , imposed and natural at the top , followed by input particle data and the resulting statistical parameters , and at bottom , the chemical potentials derived from these , for rhic central rapidity , most central collisions .",
    "@xmath56 values are obtained from the constraint to zero strangeness .",
    "the weak feeds allowed were as stated by experimental groups or / and estimated by us , however , in the fit of the @xmath57 yields we accepted complete weak feed from all hyperons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we believe that the assumption of @xmath46 , we often see in literature in the context of the analysis of hadron particle yield data , tests the hypothesis that qgp was _ not _ , or only extremely _ briefly _ present in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the tacit assumption made is that instead of a qgp , a long - lasting cascade of hadronic reactions allows the hg particles to chemically equilibrate .",
    "however , if this were to be true , an even stronger evidence for hg dominance of hi reactions would be that the value @xmath58 emerges in the analysis , rather than being assumed",
    ". however , we find allowing @xmath59 that , nearly always , the chemical non - equilibrium prevails , with a much higher confidence level . furthermore , this additional freedom produces qgp like properties of the bulk from which particles emerge .",
    "to summarize , we differ from other groups in the following aspects in our data analysis :    1 .",
    "we use @xmath60 , and thus allow the ratio of baryon to meson yields to be fixed independently of the hadronization temperature ; 2 .",
    "we enforce , in the fit , the conserved ratio of charge to baryon number @xmath61 , and are able to fit the associated @xmath62 fugacity ; 3 .",
    "we do not enforce exact strangeness conservation , @xmath63 , but instead , we allow @xmath64 to behave like a measurement , the reasoning is as follows : + summing all measured and unmeasured hadrons in strangeness ` conservation ' condition , @xmath65 , combines independent measurement errors and thus , even if the experimental data had all strangeness carrying hadrons , there would be a residual statistical error present in @xmath66 ; + some strangeness could escape detection in unknown ` particles ' , for example being bound in ( nearly ) @xmath67-quark - symmetric semi - stable strangelett ( a small drop of quark matter ) , this leads to @xmath68  which is what we find as a preferred result in low energy fits ; + the experiments did measure many , but not all relevant particles carrying strangeness , e.g. , @xmath69 has not been measured , this yield is uncertain and thus @xmath70 can not be ever imposed on experimental grounds alone ; + introducing an error in @xmath66 , we perform a test of the hypothesis that weak decays remains weak in qgp phase , and thus , the net strangeness remains conserved  another way to understand this is to note that we can not confirm that weak decays in qgp remain weak to better than the progressing error of individual contributing measurements .",
    "in the study of rhic data , we consider a mix of star and phenix particle yield results , following the principle that the phenix integrated single particle spectra are more reliable than those of star , and star , in turn , given its high acceptance is more reliable in evaluation of yields of hadrons observed in their two or more particle decay channels .",
    "the reader should note that we have , in our fits compared to many other efforts , three more parameters : @xmath2 as explicitly stated above , @xmath56 since we do not fix but fit strangeness conservation and @xmath62 since , as the only group , we enforce a fit to @xmath71 .",
    "thus , we have , in general , one less degrees of freedom ( three more parameters and two more ` data ' points , @xmath72 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , the real issue is that all told we have a 7-dimensional space of parameters , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which contains many false minima , and the art of finding the domain of the best fit minimum is not easily acquired , and can not be dispensed with the comment ` fit is unstable ' .",
    "naturally , it takes much more effort to find a true minimum in a 7-d parameter world , compared to a 2-d parameter world which corresponds to the simplest and least physical `` equilibrium '' model with @xmath75 as parameters , i.e. , setting also @xmath76 , fixing @xmath40 by strangeness conservation and using only particle ratios in the fit .",
    "whoever practices this today has learned nothing from the work of past 20 years .",
    "the most intriguing result of this analysis is the smoothness , and even near constancy , of physical properties of the fireball at chemical freeze - out condition seen for the top three sps energies 40 , 80 and 158 @xmath77gev , which result agrees well with rhic fits where we impose the pressure @xmath78 and hadronization particle energy @xmath79 .",
    "of particular physical interest is the value of hadronization pressure , @xmath80 mev/@xmath1 , obtained at sps , and found in this work to be consistent with rhic data ",
    "one may imagine that in a phase transformation from quarks to hadrons , the pressure of quarks is transferred into the pressure of color - neutral hadrons , which can escape from the deconfined fireball .",
    "since the flow pressure of quarks transfers smoothly into that of hadrons , we conclude that the thermal pressure of produced hadrons , @xmath80 mev/@xmath1 , provides a first estimate of the pressure of the vacuum which keeps color charged quarks inside the fireball up to the point of sudden fireball break - up .    in summary , we presented a high confidence fit of high centrality data form ags , sps and rhic , and have found common ground of results at sps and rhic regarding the bulk properties of hadronizing matter .",
    "this suggests that a deconfined phase is with great probability already formed at or near 30 @xmath77 gev .",
