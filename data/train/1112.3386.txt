    "strong emission bands at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3 - the so - called unidentified infrared ( uir ) bands - dominate the mid - ir spectra of almost all objects , including reflection nebulae , planetary nebulae , the interstellar medium and regions .",
    "these bands are generally attributed to ir fluorescence of a family of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) pumped by the uv radiation field . a key result in the observational studies of pahs",
    "is that their mid - ir bands show clear variations in peak positions , shapes and ( relative ) intensities , not only between sources , but also spatially within extended sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the variability in intensity ratio of the main pah bands has been interpreted in terms of the charge state and excitation levels of the pahs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the degree of uv processing @xcite .",
    "in addition to the well - studied main pah bands , a plethora of weaker pah bands are present , for example in the 15 - 20 region .",
    "pah emission in this region was first observed with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) : new features were reported at 15.8 , 16.4 , 17.4 and 17.9 with the 16.4 and then 17.4 pah bands being the most prominent @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite presented evidence for a variable , broad plateau from 15 to 20 which seems to be present solely in regions @xcite . based upon observations with the spitzer space telescope ,",
    "additional broad components are reported at 16.6 , 17.0 and 17.2 @xcite .",
    "but it is really the high sensitivity of spitzer that revealed the omnipresence of these bands within the milky way and in other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as a consequence , the bands in the 15 - 20 region are expected to reveal more about the overall molecular structure of the carriers than do the major bands below 15 .",
    "an intriguing result of the spitzer observations is the remarkable similarity ( to first order ) of the 15 - 20 pah emission spectra from regions spanning a large range of physical conditions .",
    "this suggests that the astronomical pah population may be dominated by a handful of stable , molecular structures ( cf .",
    "survival of the fittest ) rather than comprised of a large number of pahs with widely varying structures @xcite .",

    "the sh off - source background observation exhibits a rising dust continuum and an 11.2 pah band .",
    "since we do not have off - source background observations for the south position , we investigated the importance of the background flux and , in particular , of the background pah emission with respect to the on - source ( pah ) flux .",
    "the 11.2 pah flux in the sh background for the northern position is 8.5 10@xmath16 w / m@xmath17/sr .",
    "this amounts to 3 - 11% of the on - source 11.2 pah flux across the north map and to @xmath181 - 10% of the on - source 11.2 pah flux across the south map excluding source d from @xcite .",
    "source d is located on the edge of the south map and has a background contribution to the pah flux of up to 45% .",
    "these results are consistent with the irac [ 8 ] image which is dominated by pah emission and indicates a background flux of @xmath2 6% the _ minimum _ on - source flux .",
    "hence , aside from source d , we conclude that the background has only a small contribution to the on - source pah flux and therefore we did not apply a background subtraction . for the remaining of this paper",

    "spectra were extracted from the spectral maps by moving , in one pixel steps , a spectral aperture of 2x2 pixels in both directions of the maps .",
    "this results in overlapping extraction apertures .",
    "no jumps in flux level were seen between the different orders within the sh module ( sh11 to sh20 ) and hence no scaling was necessary .",
    "a typical 15 - 20 spectrum of ngc2023 reveals a rising dust continuum , a sharp h@xmath1 emission line ( 17 ) , an emission band at 19 attributed to c@xmath0 @xcite , a feature at 17.4 which is a blend of a pah band with another c@xmath0 band and a plethora of pah emission bands at 15.8 , 16.4 , 17.4 and , 17.8 on top of a broad underlying emission component ( fig.[fig_sp ] ) .",
    "ngc2023 contains a cluster of young stars @xcite .",
    "the yso source d is located just outside the fov of the south map ( see fig.[fov ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the spectra of regions close to source d show pah emission features as well as characteristics typically for ysos , i.e. a strong dust continuum ( see the continuum map at 19.29 in fig.[fig_maps_s ] ) and a ( strong ) co@xmath1 ice feature near 15 .",
    "furthermore , the background contribution to the 11.2 pah flux is significant for a large fraction of these ( ice-)spectra . we therefore excluded these spectra in the pah and the 14.9 continuum analysis .",
    "the 15 - 20 spectrum of the yso source c has the same spectral characteristics as the spectra across ngc2023 but has an enhanced surface brightness ( see pixels @xmath2 ( 21 , 6 ) in the continuum maps at 14.9 and 19.29 in fig.[fig_maps_s ] ) .",

    "this decomposition method is further referred to as the spline decomposition .",
    "the applied decomposition of the 15 - 20 region is not unique .",
    "for example , @xcite fit this region by a combination of a continuum fit ( similar to our global continuum ) and eight gaussians ( further referred to as the gaussian decomposition ) .",
    "similarly , a combination of drude profiles is regularly used ( pahfit , * ? ? ?",
    "for comparison , we applied both methods to our spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sp ] ) . to provide sufficiently wavelength coverage for pahfit",
    ", we obtained the sl spectrum for the same extraction aperture as the sh spectrum .",
    "however , we did not correct for the different psf at these wavelengths .",
    "the pahfit decomposition in the 15 - 20 region results in components representing the dust continuum emission ( which is a combination of modified blackbodies , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the h@xmath1 emission and the pah dust features including a broad component centered at 17.0 .",
    "we also applied a similar decomposition as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig . 8 and",
    "table 1 ) to our spectra by using their gaussian parameters as a starting value .",
    "this method results in two possible decompositions of the 15 - 20 region ; one dominated by a broad component peaking around @xmath2 17.2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sp ] , third panel ) or another one in which this 17.2 component is much narrower resulting in broader and stronger components near 16.6 and 17.4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sp ] , fourth panel ) .",
    "hence , in order to study the pah bands in a consistent way , one needs to restrict the decomposition to a broad _ or _ narrow 17.2 component . but",
    "choosing one over the other will clearly influence the derived fluxes of the gaussian components .    the gaussian decomposition with the broad 17.2 component results in very similar fluxes for the features as those obtained with the spline decomposition discussed above , except for the 15.8 and 16.4 bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sp ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "in contrast , different pah band intensities are obtained with the gaussian decomposition with the narrow 17.2 component and the pahfit decomposition . in particular , the broad component centered around 17 depends significantly on the decomposition method . here",
    "we will adopt the spline decomposition ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sp ] , top panel ) .",
    "here we investigate i ) the relationship between individual pah emission bands and ii ) the relationship between the different emission components - pahs , h@xmath1 , c@xmath0 , and dust continuum - present in the 15 - 20 region based upon the spatial distribution and the intensity ratios of the various emission components .",

    "these were derived from the sh data and are discussed in peeters et al .",
    "( 2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "the north map is characterized by lower flux levels and therefore larger scatter is present in the map tracing the 15.8 and 17.8 features and , to a lesser extent , the 18.9 band .",
    "hence , when discussing the spatial distribution of the 15.8 and 17.8 bands , we restrict ourselves to the south map .    _ feature correlations _ : to investigate possible variations within the pah spectrum itself , we need to exclude the influence of pah abundance and column density .",
    "this is achieved by normalizing the fluxes to another band in this region . here",
    "we start with the 11.2 pah band , which is attributed to solo ch out - of - plane bending vibration of large , neutral pahs @xcite . to look for possible correlations with the 11.2 band",
    ", we also apply a normalization to the 12.7 pah band which is attributed to duo and trio ch out - of - plane bending vibration of large pahs @xcite .",

    "a correlation is often found between the normalized intensity ratios of pah bands in this region as these bands arise from a family of pah molecules which all have the same basic structural unit .",
    "however , variations in charge states , excitation level , edge structures , etc . , exist within the pah family which can tighten as well as loosen correlations between the normalized intensity ratios of specific pah bands . for example , the well known tight correlation between the 6.2 and 7.7 pah bands is attributed to the common charge state of these bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the correlation coefficients and the fit parameters are given in table [ fit_parameters ] . while maps smooth out the detailed , fine grained variations , allowing one to see the big picture , these correlations highlight subtle differences .",
    "_ results : _ the following trends are derived from the south spectral maps shown in fig .  [ fig_maps_s ] .",
    "the 11.2 feature , the 15.8 feature and the 15 - 18 plateau show very similar spatial morphology with distinct peaks at the s and sse positions in the irac map .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of the 12.7 , 16.4 , 17.4 , and 17.8 features are displaced towards the star .",
    "the 12.7 and 16.4 bands have very similar spatial behavior ; both peak at the sse position and show a broad , diffuse plateau nw of the line connecting the s and sse ridges .",
    "the 17.4 feature also presents a strong , diffuse plateau nw of that line , but does _ not _ show a peak at the sse position as does the 12.7 and 16.4 bands .",
    "in addition , the 17.4 feature has a separate peak in the upper right of the field , coinciding with the peak in the 18.9 band .",
    "the 17.8 band peaks primarily on the sse position , overlapping with the peak of both the 11.2 and 12.7 bands but also shows some enhanced emission slightly offset from the 11.2 peak near the s ridge , though not as much as the 12.7 and 16.4 bands .",
    "the 18.9 band is clearly in a class by itself , peaking closer to the illuminating star than any of the other features considered here .",
    "interestingly , a second peak is evident in the 18.9 spatial distribution at source c. note also that the 18.9 band does show ( weak ) emission tracing the s and sse ridges .",
    "the spatial behavior of the 14.9 and 19.29 continuum intensities align closely with the h@xmath1 emission distribution , all lying along the se portion of the 11.2 contours , while clearly avoiding regions with strong 12.7 emission .",
    "the h@xmath1 map shows , however , additional emission towards the west .",
    "the similarity in distribution of the 11.2 and 15 - 18 plateau is also evident in the north map ( fig .",
    "[ fig_maps_n ] ) : both maps peak on the nw ridge and extend to include the n ridge .",
    "there is too much scatter in the weak 15.8 pah band to warrant comparison .",
    "in addition , the 16.4 pah band has a spatial distribution very similar to that of the 12.7 band .",
    "however , unlike the situation at the sse ridge where the 11.2 , 12.7 and 16.4  bands all peak in the same place , the 12.7 and 16.4 bands are clearly displaced towards the south with respect to the 11.2 emission in both the peak emission and the n ridge extension .",
    "the 17.4 and 18.9 bands exhibit more scatter in the north map .",
    "nevertheless , the 17.4 band seems to peak towards the nw ridge and further west of this ridge .",
    "in contrast , the 18.9 band seems to trace the n ridge and not the nw ridge while also showing secondary emission in the south .",
    "the spatial behavior of the 14.9 and 19.29 continuum emission and the h@xmath1 emissions are quite distinct from the pah emission in the north map as they do not track the 11.2 contours as closely and only trace the n ridge and not the nw ridge .",
    "this morphology suggests that the features can be viewed as falling into the following groups : 1 ) the 11.2 , 15.8 bands and the 15 - 18 plateau ; 2 ) the 12.7 , and 16.4 bands ; 3 ) the 17.4 diffuse component ; 4 ) the 17.8 band ; 5 ) the 18.9 and ( some of ) the 17.4 features ; 6 ) the underlying continuum producing the emission measured here at 14.9 and 19.2 ; and 7 ) the h@xmath1 emission .",

    "this is consistent with the assignment of the 18.9 band to c@xmath0 and the 17.4 feature to being a blend of a pah emission band with a c@xmath0 band @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 17.4 band was decomposed into these two components to estimate the spatial distribution of the pah contribution to this band .",
    "this is referred to as the diffuse 17.4 band .",
    "we calculated the average ratio of the 18.9/17.4 band intensity in the upper right corner of the _ south _ map ( where the 18.9 band peaks ) and used this value to subtract the c@xmath0 contribution to the 17.4 band to obtain the `` diffuse 17.4 band '' for both the south and north map ( see fig .",

    "[ cont ] , different spectral decompositions have been applied in the literature .",
    "this is in particular true for the treatment of the broad underlying plateaus .",
    "they are either considered to be part of the pah bands themselves which are then fitted by lorentzians or drude profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or they are considered to be independent of these pah bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this paper ) .",
    "the spatial maps and the band correlations clearly indicate that there are significant differences in the spatial distribution between the 15 - 18 plateau and most pah bands .",
    "these spatial differences suggest a different carrier for the plateau and the individual pah bands ( with the exclusion of the 15.8 band ) , a finding consistent with earlier suggestions for the plateaus underlying the prominent mid - ir bands between 5 and 13 @xcite .      the emission features between 15 - 20 can be collected into seven groups as discussed in section [ groups ] . here",
    "we discuss these in terms of the specific characteristics that set each group apart and make them particularly sensitive to the local physical conditions .",
    "_ group 1 : the 11.2 , 15.8 bands and the 15 - 18 plateau .",
    "_ since the 11.2  band is associated with the solo ch out - of - plane vibration of large , neutral pahs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the 15.8 band and the 15 - 18 plateau must arise from species that are favored by the same conditions that favor this subset of the pah population .",
    "in contrast with expectations , the 15 - 20 region shows little systematic dependence on pah class or molecular structure as present in the nasa ames pah ir spectroscopic database @xcite , suggesting that molecular structure is not the main origin for the observed correlations .",
    "keep in mind that , to date , the database is biased to smaller pahs and the astronomical emission at these longer wavelengths is dominated by larger pahs .",
    "thus , as knowledge of larger pah spectroscopy increases , this suggestion should be revisited .",
    "in addition , ionization only has a moderate influence on the pah emission in the 15 - 20 region @xcite : it slightly influences the relative strength of the emission bands but not their peak position . based on theoretical and experimental pah spectra",
    ", one can therefore not assign a particular charge state to these individual bands , unlike for the mid - ir bands .",
    "therefore , we suggest that large , neutral pahs are also responsible for the 15.8 band and 15 - 18 plateau",
    ". pah clusters , vsgs ( very small grains ) or small hac particles may also contribute to the 15 - 18 plateau .",
    "however , the spread of the correlations in fig . [ fig_correlations ] shows there is not a one - to - one correspondence between the carriers of these different emission features .",
    "these differences reflect minor changes in the relative populations of the different band carriers , perhaps arising from slightly different molecular structures , excitation levels , and so on .",
    "_ group 2 : the 12.7 and 16.4 bands .",
    "_ similarly , since the 16.4 and 12.7  bands correlate with the 6.2 and 7.7  pah cation bands ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* peeters et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . )",
    ", the 12.7 and 16.4 bands must arise from species that are co - spatial with the cationic portion of the emitting pah population .",
    "again , as with group 1 , the spread of the correlations in fig . [ fig_correlations",
    "] shows there is not a one - to - one correspondence between these different carriers .",
    "however , in contrast with group 1 , we can not propose molecular structure or charge as the main origin for these bands . indeed , laboratory and theoretical pah spectra indicate that the 12.7 and 16.4 bands are sensitive to the molecular edge structure : the former being due to duo and trio ch groups @xcite and the latter being systematically present in pahs with pendent rings @xcite and large pahs with pointy edges @xcite . laboratory and theoretical pah spectra also indicate that both neutral and ionized pahs can contribute to the 12.7 and 16.4 emission @xcite and hence do not allow , by themselves , the assignment of these bands to a single charge state .",
    "similarly , blind signal separation of the pah emission across pdrs can not assign a single charge state to the 12.7 band ( the 16.4 band is not analysed by this method ) .",
    "indeed , this method revealed three spatially different components , referred to as pah@xmath23 , pah@xmath24 and vsg , which are attributed to respectively neutral pahs , ionized pahs , and pah clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 12.7 band is present in both the pah@xmath23 and pah@xmath24 components .",
    "however , the relative contribution of the 12.7 band in the pah@xmath23 and pah@xmath24 components seems to vary for different decomposition methods and sources @xcite .",
    "hence , further investigation is warranted .",
    "_ group 3 : the 17.4 diffuse component .",
    "_ this paper confirms the results by @xcite that the 17.4 emission band is composed of emission due to c@xmath0 and pahs ( i.e. , the diffuse 17.4 component ) . in addition ,",
    "@xcite report a similar spatial distribution between the diffuse 17.4 emission and the 16.4 pah band in the reflection nebulae ngc7023 .",
    "in contrast , in ngc2023 , the spatial distribution of the diffuse 17.4 emission is quite distinct from that of the 16.4 band .",
    "in particular , in the north map , the diffuse 17.4 emission is strong close to the peak 16.4 emission as well as west of the nw ridge . in the south map",
    ", it is located closer towards the illuminating star compared to the 11.2 , 12.7 and 16.4 pah emission and does not peak in the sse ridge where the 11.2 , 12.7 and 16.4 pah bands peak .",
    "perusal of the nasa ames pah ir spectroscopic database @xcite reveals that large compact pahs systematically show emission near 17.4 and that pah charge only has moderate influence on the relative intensities and no influence on the peak position of the bands in the 15 - 20 region @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the diffuse 17.4 band is due to doubly ionized pahs and/or a subset of pah cations that favor more harsh conditions compared to those responsible for the 6.2 pah bands , such as for example dehydrogenated cations .",
    "this possible assignment will further be explored by comparison to the pah emission at shorter wavelengths in a forthcoming publication ( peeters et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "_ group 4 : the 17.8 band .",
    "_ the 17.8 emission exhibits spatial characteristics between those of the 11.2 and 12.7 bands . with the former spatial distribution being attributed to neutral pahs and the latter being co - spatial with that of the pah cations , the 17.8 band likely originates from both neutrals and cations ( with both having similar intrinsic strengths for this band ) .",
    "_ group 5 : the 18.9 and ( some of ) the 17.4 feature .",
    "_ these two bands have recently been assigned to c@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath0 bands show a distinct spatial distribution . in the south , they reach their peak emission intensities in regions closer to the exciting star than are the pah bands , similar to what is observed towards ngc7023 @xcite .",
    "in addition , secondary peaks in emission are found near source c , a yso , and where the pah emission peaks .",
    "in contrast , in the north , the peak in the c@xmath0 distribution seems to be farther away from the illuminating source ( no other uv sources are present near this position ) and linked to the h / h@xmath1 transition zone .",
    "this different behavior in the c@xmath0 emission may well provide important clues to the formation and evolution of c@xmath0 in the ism .",
    "this will be further explored when the full pah spectra will be analyzed ( peeters et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "_ group 6 : the continuum producing the emission at 14.9 and 19.2 .",
    "_ this emission component peaks further into the filament with respect to the pah emission .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the blind signal separation discussed above : the vsg component , attributed to pah clusters , carries the mid - ir continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as it is located deeper in the pdr compared to the pah emission , these authors suggested the destruction of pah clusters by uv photons and subsequent formation of pahs .",
    "as mentioned above , pah clusters may also contribute to the 15 - 18 plateau , which is slightly offset compared to the dust continuum emission .",
    "this suggest that the carriers of these emission components slightly differ .",
    "_ group 7 : the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "_ for the analysis of the h@xmath1 emission present in this data set , we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we studied the emission in the 15 - 20 region towards the reflection nebula ngc2023 by analysing two spectral maps obtained with spitzer s infrared spectrograph ( irs ) , short - wavelength high - resolution mode .",
    "we observed pah emission bands at 15.8 , 16.4 , 17.4 , and 17.8 , a broad pah plateau between 15 - 18 , c@xmath0 emission at 17.4 and 18.9 , and h@xmath1 emission at 17.0 superposed on a dust continuum .",
    "+ we found distinct spatial distributions for these emission components and found tight intensity correlations between some emission components . based on these results , we collected the emission components in seven groups and discussed their specific characteristics .",
    "_ group 2 : the 12.7 and 16.4 pah bands .",
    "_ compared to group 1 , these bands are displaced towards the illuminating star .",
    "we concluded that they must arise from species that are co - spatial with the cationic portion of the emitting pah population .",
    "_ group 3 : the 17.4 diffuse component .",
    "_ we estimated the pah contribution to the 17.4 band and found that its spatial distribution is displaced towards the illuminating star compared to groups 1 and 2 .",

    "the c@xmath0 emission shows a spatial distribution distinct from that of the pah emission , consistent with @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spatial behavior of c@xmath0 towards ngc2023 is different in the south and north . specifically , the c@xmath0 emission is located closer to the illuminating star compared to the pah and h@xmath1 emission in the south while in the north , it seems to be associated to the h / h@xmath1 transition .",
    "_ group 6 : the underlying continuum producing the emission measured here at 14.9 and 19.2 . _",
    "the continuum emission is strongest deeper into the pdr compared to the pah emission .",
