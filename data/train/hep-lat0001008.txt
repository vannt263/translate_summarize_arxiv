    "today , we believe that the world of quarks and gluons is described theoretically by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . this model shows a number of non - perturbative aspects that can not be adequately addressed by approximation schemes such as perturbation theory . the only way to evaluate qcd , addressing both its perturbative and non - perturbative aspects _ at the same time _ , is lattice qcd . in this approach",
    "the theory is put on a 4-dimensional euclidean space - time lattice of finite physical length @xmath0 , with a non - vanishing value of the lattice spacing @xmath1 . having only a finite number of grid points ,",
    "physical quantities can be computed numerically by solving a high - dimensional integral by monte carlo methods , making use of importance sampling .",
    "the introduction of a lattice spacing regularizes the theory and is an intermediate step in the computation of physical observables .",
    "eventually , the regularization has to be removed and the value of the lattice spacing has to be sent to zero to reach the target theory , i.e. continuum qcd . in fact , in conventional formulations of lattice qcd @xcite , the introduction of the lattice spacing renders the theory on the lattice somewhat different from the continuum analogue and a number of properties of the continuum theory are only very difficult and cumbersome to establish in the lattice regularized theory .",
    "one of the main reasons for this difficulty is that in conventional lattice qcd the regularization breaks a particular symmetry of the continuum theory , which plays a most important role there , namely chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the last few years have seen a major breakthrough in that we now have formulations of lattice qcd that have an exact lattice chiral symmetry @xcite . in this approach , many properties of continuum qcd are preserved _ even at a non - vanishing value of the lattice spacing _ @xcite .",
    "this development followed the rediscovery @xcite of the so - called ginsparg ",
    "wilson ( gw ) relation @xcite which is fulfilled by any operator with the exact lattice chiral symmetry of @xcite .",
    "it is not the aim of this contribution to discuss the physics consequences of the gw relation .",
    "we have to refer the interested reader to reviews @xcite about these topics . here",
    "we would like to discuss the _ numerical _ treatment of a particular lattice operator that satisfies the gw relation , namely neuberger s solution @xcite .",
    "this solution has a complicated structure and is challenging to implement numerically .",
    "thus , the large theoretical advantage of an operator satisfying the gw relation must be weighed against the very demanding computational effort required to implement it .",
    "this contribution is organized as follows .",
    "after discussing neuberger s lattice dirac operator we want to show how we evaluated the operator in our practical application @xcite and what kind of improvements we found to accelerate the numerical computations . for alternative ideas for improvements ,",
    "see the contributions of h. neuberger @xcite and a. borici @xcite to this workshop .",
    "we finally give some estimates of the computational expense of using neuberger s operator .",
    "the operator we have used acts on fields ( complex vectors ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the @xmath4 , are integer numbers denoting a 4-dimensional grid point in a lattice of size @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the fields @xmath2 carry in addition a `` colour '' index @xmath7 as well as a `` dirac '' index @xmath8 .",
    "hence , @xmath9 is a @xmath10 complex vector .    in order to reach the expression for neuberger s operator we first introduce the matrix @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the nearest - neighbour forward and backward derivatives ,",
    "the precise definition of which can be found in the appendix .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is to be taken in the range of @xmath16 and serves to optimize the localization properties @xcite of neuberger s operator , which is then given by @xmath17 through the appearance of the square root in eq .",
    "( [ defofneu ] ) , all points on the lattice are connected with one another , giving rise to a very complicated , multi - neighbour action .",
    "however , the application of @xmath18 to a vector @xmath9 will only contain applications of @xmath11 or @xmath19 on this vector .",
    "since these matrices are sparse , as only nearest - neighbour interactions are involved , we will never have to store the whole matrix .    in the computation of physical quantities , the inverse of @xmath18 , applied to a given vector ,",
    "is generically needed .",
    "hence one faces the problem of having to compute a vector @xmath20 , with @xmath21 a prescribed vector ( the `` source '' ) as required by the particular problem under investigation .",
    "fortunately , a number of efficiently working algorithms for computing @xmath20 are known , such as conjugate gradient , bicgstab , or variants thereof @xcite . in conventional approaches to lattice qcd an operator @xmath22 is used that is very similar to the matrix @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ defofa ] ) .",
    "computing the vector @xmath23 requires a number @xmath24 of iterations of some particular method , say bicgstab . employing neuberger s operator @xmath18 in computing @xmath20 , it turns out that the number of iterations needed is of the same order of magnitude as when using @xmath22 . at the same time , in each of these iterations , the square root has to be evaluated .",
    "when this is done by some polynomial approximation , it is found that the required degree of this polynomial is roughly of the same order as the number of iterations needed for computing the vector @xmath25 .",
    "hence , with respect to the conventional case , the numerical effort is squared and the price to pay for using the operator @xmath18 is high .",
    "on the other hand , any solution of the ginsparg ",
    "wilson relation gives us a tool by which particular problems in lattice qcd can be studied , which would be extremely hard to address with conventional approaches .",
    "it is for these cases that the large numerical effort is justified , but clearly , we would like to have clever ideas coming from areas such as applied mathematics , to decrease the numerical expense or even overcome this bottleneck .",
    "for computing the square root that appears in eq .",
    "( [ defofneu ] ) , we have chosen a chebyshev approximation @xcite by constructing a polynomial @xmath27 of degree @xmath28 , which has an exponential convergence rate in the interval @xmath29 $ ] . outside this interval , convergence is still found but it will not be exponential . the advantages of using this chebyshev approximation are the well - controlled exponential fit accuracy as well as the possibility of having numerically very stable recursion relations @xcite to construct the polynomial , allowing for large degrees . in order to have an optimal approximation , it is desirable to know the lowest and the highest eigenvalue of @xmath19 .",
    "a typical example of the eigenvalues of @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen_aa ] , where we show the 11 lowest eigenvalues as obtained on a number of configurations using the ritz functional method @xcite .",
    "there is a wide spread and very low - lying eigenvalues appear . choosing @xmath30 to be the value of the lowest of these eigenvalues would result in a huge degree @xmath28 of the polynomial @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore computed @xmath32 lowest - lying eigenvalues of @xmath19 as well as their eigenfunctions and projected them out of the matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the approximation is then only performed for the matrix with a reduced condition number , resulting in a substantial decrease of the degree of the polynomial .",
    "in addition , we computed the highest eigenvalue of @xmath19 and normalized the matrix @xmath11 such that @xmath33 .    since our work @xcite , aiming at the physical question of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in lattice qcd , has been one of the first of its kind , we wanted to exclude possible systematic errors and demanded a very high precision for the approximation to the square root : @xmath34 where @xmath25 is a gaussian random vector . in our practical applications we fixed this precision beforehand and",
    "set @xmath30 to be the @xmath35th lowest eigenvalue of @xmath19 .",
    "this then determines the degree of the polynomial @xmath28 and hence our approximation @xmath36 to the exact neuberger operator @xmath18 .",
    "we checked that the precision we required for the approximation of the square root is directly related to the precision by which the gw relation itself is fulfilled .",
    "choosing @xmath28 such that the accuracy in eq .",
    "( [ precofgw ] ) is reached results in @xmath37x\\|^2 /\\|x\\|^2",
    "\\approx           10^{-16}\\ ; .\\ ] ] in addition , we find that the deviations from the exact gw relation decrease exponentially fast with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "as mentioned above , in physics applications a vector @xmath38 has to be computed , with @xmath21 a prescribed source vector .",
    "not only is the computation of this vector very costly , there also appears to be a conceptual problem : in inspecting the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath39 , very small eigenvalues are often found as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen_dd ] .",
    "these very small eigenvalues belong to a given chiral sector of the theory , i.e. their corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath40 are eigenfunctions of @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , these modes play an important physical role as they are associated with topological sectors of the theory @xcite .",
    "as far as the practical applications are concerned , it is clear that in the presence of such a small eigenvalue , the inversion of @xmath36 will be very costly , as the condition number of the problem is then very high . in order to address this problem , we followed two strategies :    * we compute the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath39 and its eigenfunction ( using again the ritz functional method @xcite ) and",
    "if it is a zero mode in which case it is also a zero mode of @xmath36 we project this mode out of @xmath36 and invert only the reduced matrix ; this is then well conditioned , as the very small eigenvalues appear to be isolated . in this strategy",
    ", the knowledge of the eigenfunction must be very precise and an accuracy of approximating the square root as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ precofsq ] ) is mandatory . *",
    "again we determine the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath39 and the chirality of the corresponding zero mode , if there is any .",
    "we then make use of the fact that @xmath39 commutes with @xmath41 .",
    "this allows us to perform the inversion in the chiral sector _ without zero modes_. in this strategy , the accuracy demanded in eq .",
    "( [ precofsq ] ) could be relaxed and this strategy , which essentially follows ref .",
    "@xcite , is in general much less expensive than following strategy @xmath43 .",
    "however , even adopting strategy @xmath44 , solving the system @xmath45 is still costly .",
    "we therefore tried two ways of improving on this .",
    "we first note that instead of solving @xmath46 x = \\eta\\ ] ] we can equally well solve @xmath47 x = a^\\dagger\\eta\\ ; .\\ ] ] in practice , however , we found no real advantage in using the formulation of eq .",
    "( [ formulation2 ] ) .",
    "we have further considered two acceleration schemes .",
    "_ scheme ( a ) _",
    "we choose two different polynomials ( now approximating @xmath48 and not the inverse ) @xmath31 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 with @xmath52 a `` small '' correction .",
    "then we have @xmath53^{-1 } & = & \\left [ a^\\dagger - p_{m,\\epsilon}-\\delta \\right]^{-1 }                   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\left [ 1 + \\left(a^\\dagger - p_{m,\\epsilon}\\right)^{-1}\\delta\\right ]                         \\left(a^\\dagger - p_{m,\\epsilon}\\right)^{-1}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this leads us to the following procedure of solving @xmath45 :    * first solve + @xmath54 * then solve + @xmath55 * use @xmath56 as a starting vector to finally solve + @xmath57    the generation of the starting vector @xmath56 in steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is only a small overhead . in fig .  [ fig : cg_nolg ] we plot the relative residuum @xmath58 as a function of the number of applications of @xmath36 . in this case @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we show the number of applications of the matrix @xmath36 for the case of a random starting vector ( dotted line ) and the case where @xmath56 was generated according to the above procedure ( solid line ) .",
    "the gain is of approximately a factor of two .",
    "_ scheme ( b ) _    in the second approach",
    ", we use a sequence of polynomials to solve @xmath45 . to this end",
    "we first solve @xmath61 x_1 = a^\\dagger \\eta\\ ] ] by choosing a polynomial @xmath62 and a stopping criterion for the solver @xmath63 such that @xmath64 the value of @xmath63 is chosen such that it is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the error that the polynomial of degree @xmath65 itself induces .",
    "the solution @xmath66 is then used as a starting vector for the next equation , employing a polynomial @xmath67 and stopping criterion @xmath68 with @xmath69 this procedure is then repeated until we reach the desired polynomial @xmath31 and stopping criterion @xmath70 to solve the real equation    @xmath71 x = a^\\dagger \\eta\\ ; .\\ ] ]    as for scheme ( a ) , we gain a factor of about two in the numerical effort .",
    "we finally remark that some first tests using the scheme proposed in @xcite resulted in a similar performance gain as the two schemes presented above .    in table",
    "[ expense ] we give a typical example of the expense of a simulation following strategy @xmath44 .",
    "we list both the cost of computing the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath39 in terms of the number of iterations to minimize the ritz functional @xcite and the number of iterations to solve @xmath45 . in both applications ,",
    "a polynomial of degree @xmath28 is used to approximate the square root .",
    "the numbers in table  [ expense ] indicate that a quenched calculation , employing neuberger s operator , leads to a computational cost that is comparable with a dynamical simulation using conventional operators .    .",
    "[ expense ] @xmath72 is the number of lattice sites along a side of the hypercube ; @xmath28 , the degree of polynomial ; @xmath73 , the number of iterations required to obtain the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath39 ; and @xmath74 , the number of iterations necessary to compute @xmath75 .",
