    "magnetic helicity is a physical quantity that describes the topology and complexity of a magnetic field .",
    "it is believed that magnetic helicity plays an important role in solar activity ( zhang & low 2005 ) .",
    "theoretical studies have suggested that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in the solar atmosphere provides free magnetic energy ; since the total magnetic helicity in a force - free magnetic field has an upper bound , once this limit is exceeded , a non - equilibrium situation will then result in cme expulsion ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "2006 , zhang & flyer 2008 , zhang et al .",
    "2012 ) .    observations also suggest that impulsive changes of the magnetic helicity injection rates have occurred during solar flares ( moon et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b , 2003 ; zhang et al .",
    "2008 ) . in a survey on 393 active regions , labonte et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that x - class flares occurred when the peak magnetic helicity injection rate is greater than @xmath0 .",
    "nindos and andrews ( 2004 ) suggested that it is the amount of stored magnetic helicity that will determine whether a big flare will be eruptive or confined .",
    "park et al . ( 2010 ) studied the occurrence of the x3.4 flare in noaa 10930 and concluded that the flare may be initiated by a helicity injection , into a system of oppositely signed helicity .",
    "similarly , vemareddy et al . (",
    "2012 ) studied the helicity injection in two active regions and suggested that flux motions and the spatial distribution of helicity injection are important ingredients in the understanding of the favorable conditions for solar eruptions .",
    "all these indicate that magnetic helicity plays an important role in solar activities and hence it is important to have an accurate measurement of the magnetic helicity injection rate .",
    "the rate of magnetic helicity flux across solar surface _ s _ ,",
    "that is , the helicity injection rate , can be estimated by the following equation ( berger 1984 ) : @xmath1ds,\\eqno{(1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the tangential and normal magnetic fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding velocities .",
    "@xmath6 is a unique vector potential satisfying following conditions : @xmath7    to apply equation ( 1 ) to observational data , we need to know @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , before the launch of sdo , the only available data with good temporal - resolution and continuous , uniform observations are longitudinal mdi / soho magnetograms . to make use of these data to estimate helicity injection rate @xmath8 , two hypothesis are frequently invoked .",
    "the first one was suggested by dmoulin & berger ( 2003 ) .",
    "they argued that the horizontal motions ( @xmath9 ) , deduced by tracking the footpoints of magnetic flux tubes , already include the effect of both the emergence and the shearing motions .",
    "this is to say that , the horizontal velocity * u * obtained by tracking the movement of magnetic footpoints is actually @xmath10 with this , equation ( 1 ) becomes simplified as @xmath11 this approach has since then become a standard procedure in calculating helicity injection rate , although * u * can be obtained by various methods such as lct ( e.g. chae 2001 ) , dave ( e.g. schuck 2006 ) and nave ( e.g. schuck 2005 ) etc .",
    "recent work ( schuck 2008 ; liu and schuck 2012 ; kazachenko et al . 2014 ; liu et al 2014 ) has called into question the validity of the demoulin and berger conjecture in which the apparent horizontal motions determined by e.g. lct flows include both the twisting and flux emergence terms .",
    "these studies find instead that lct or dave - derived flows correspond mainly with the true horizontal motions , and are insensitive to flux emergence . on the other hand ,",
    "liu and schuck ( 2012 ) and liu et al ( 2014 ) find that in a variety of active regions , the horizontal ( twisting ) term dominates the flux emergence term , even in cases where magnetic flux is observed to be emerging .",
    "the end result is that a straightforward application of equation ( 4 ) , in which the velocity * u * used include the results of horizontal velocities returned by lct or dave , should include the dominant contribution to the magnetic helicity flux .",
    "the second hypothesis comes from assuming that magnetic fields on the photosphere are predominantly vertical . with this , the vertical magnetic field strength @xmath3 in equations ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) can then be estimated as the observed line of sight magnetic field strength @xmath12 times @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the heliocentric angle of the region . using active region noaa 10365 as an example , chae et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that this method can be more generally applied , even to regions with inclined magnetic fields .",
    "similar to the approach proposed by dmoulin & berger ( 2003 ) , this has also become a standard approach and many studies have been carried out based on these two hypothesis .    with the launch of sdo , we now have the full disk vector magnetograms with good time cadence and continuity ( hoeksema et al . 2014 , bobra et al .",
    "now we can use equation ( 1 ) to calculate the full terms of helicity injection rate . at the same time",
    ", it is possibly also the time for us to find out the degree of inaccuracy that our above two hypothesis have brought to us , in order to better understand previous results that have been obtained based on the two hypothesis .    in this paper",
    "we intend to investigate the influence of the second hypothesis , that is , the effect of the existence of non - radial magnetic field on measuring magnetic helicity transport .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the sample and data reduction .",
    "our analysis and results are given in section 3 .",
    "conclusion and discussion are presented in section 4 .",
    "the magnetograms we used in this study are taken by hmi / sdo . the hmi instrument ( scherrer et al .",
    "2012 ; schou et al .",
    "2012a , 2012b ) observes the full solar disk at 6173 with a @xmath15 ccd detector to study the oscillations and magnetic fields on the photosphere .",
    "the magnetograms are obtained using a milne - eddington ( me ) based inversion code ( borrero et al .",
    "2011 ) and the @xmath16 ambiguity problem is resolved using a  minimum energy \" algorithm ( metcalf 1994 ; metcalf et al . 2006 ; leka et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "two streams of active - region vector data have been produced and provided ( sun et al .",
    "2013 ) , namely , hmi.sharp_720s and hmi.sharp_cea_720s .",
    "the series of hmi.sharp_720s preserves vector data in the native coordinate , i.e. a 2d array as measured at each ccd pixel .",
    "the field vectors are expressed as field strength ( @xmath17 ) , inclination ( @xmath18 ) and azimuth ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the series of hmi.sharp_cea_720s uses a cylindrical equal area ( cea ) projection .",
    "the standard cea coordinates ( x , y ) relate to the heliographic longitude and latitude , with each pixel representing a same area , which makes them suitable for the computation of total flux .",
    "the field vectors in hmi.sharp_cea_720s are presented as ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) in heliocentric spherical coordinate , and are obtained by mathematical methods , called `` remapping '' and `` vector transformation '' , from the hmi.sharp_720s data .",
    "we use both streams of the active - region vector data in this study .",
    "we use series of hmi.sharp_cea_720s to obtain @xmath20 , that is , @xmath3 in equations ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) . we use series of hmi.sharp_720s to get the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath12 , the type of data used in most previous studies . to make the two series of data comparable on a pixel - to - pixel basis , we have remapped the hmi.sharp_720s data to cea coordinate .",
    "since we are primarily interested in testing the second hypothesis , we will focus on comparing the difference between using the `` real '' @xmath3 , from vector data , and the `` estimated '' @xmath23 , by assuming that the magnetic field is radial .",
    "we will use equation ( 4 ) to calculate the magnetic helicity injection rate .",
    "the vector potential @xmath6 and the horizontal velocity field * u * are derived by the methods of fast fourier transform ( fft ) and the differential affine velocity estimator ( dave ; schuck , 2006 ) respectively .",
    "the accumulated magnetic helicity is also calculated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the starting time of our calculation .",
    "we studied three active regions , noaa 11072 , noaa 11084 and noaa 11158 . both noaa 11072 and noaa",
    "11158 are emerging active regions and have been studied by liu & schuck ( 2012 ) with a purpose different from ours .",
    "noaa 11072 has a bipolar magnetic field structure with no c - class or above flares occurred during its passage of the disk .",
    "noaa 11158 is a multipolar complex active region that produced several major flares . for a comparison , noaa 11084",
    "is selected as a mature and simple active region with no significant flaring activity .",
    "compared to liu & schuck ( 2012 ) , our sample contains data extending closer to the solar limb , ending up when the three active regions are 60 degrees in longitude near the western limb .",
    "table.1 lists some properties of these three active regions .",
    "* table 1 . *",
    "sample of active regions    [ tab1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note : the unit for @xmath26 and @xmath27 is @xmath28 , for @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 .    a more quantitative comparison is given in table 4 .",
    "we see that at the position of w40 , even though the helicity injection rates of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are obviously different , the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath34 are not very large .",
    "the largest difference between @xmath29 and @xmath34 at w40 is @xmath35 .",
    "interesting is that for active regions noaa 11158 and noaa 11084 even at 60 degrees from the disk center , the differences between @xmath29 and @xmath34 are still smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "these indicate that if the observation is done not far away from the disk center , for example within 40 or 45 degrees from the disk center , the effect of non - radial magnetic field on the calculation of accumulated magnetic helicity is not severe .",
    "we have used hmi / sdo magnetic field data to investigate the effect of non - radial magnetic field on measuring magnetic helicity transport across solar photosphere .",
    "three active regions are studied .",
    "they are noaa 11072 , noaa 11084 and noaa 11158 .",
    "first , we compared the differences between the true radial magnetic field @xmath20 and the estimated radial field obtained by @xmath37 based on the assumption that magnetic field is radial .",
    "the comparison shows that the radial assumption is not valid and can bring in significant distortion on the magnetic structure when the active region is far away from the disk center .",
    "then we studied the effect of the non - radial magnetic field on estimating tangential velocity using the method of dave .",
    "interestingly we found that the effect is relative small .",
    "the main reason might be that , though the structure of the estimated radial magnetic field obtained based on the radial assumption is obviously different from that of the true radial field when the active region is away from disk center , the information on the field - line footpoints movement is still preserved .    finally , we discussed the effect of non - radial magnetic field on estimating the magnetic helicity transport . when the active region is far away from the disk center , the radial assumption can bring in much distortion on the distribution of helicity injection rate and even the sign of the injection rate can be opposite to that of the true one .",
    "however , if we only consider the amount of accumulated magnetic helicity , the effect of non - radial magnetic field then becomes minor , as long as our calculation is done within 40 or 45 degrees from the disk center .",
    "we thank yang liu ( stanford university ) for helps in providing dave4vm package which includes dave programs and in treating hmi / sdo data .",
