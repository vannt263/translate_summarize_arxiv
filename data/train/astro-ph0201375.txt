    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments such as boomerang @xcite and dasi @xcite predict that the ordinary baryonic matter accounts for about @xmath14 of the total matter in the universe .",
    "but the directly observed components , such as stars , interstellar medium and intracluster gas , only account for a few percent of this baryon budget , while more than @xmath15 baryons have escaped direct detections @xcite .",
    "this is known as the missing baryon problem .",
    "the missing baryons are believed to be in the form of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and have been difficult to detect directly . to understand their state , such as density , temperature , peculiar velocity and metalicity , stands as a major challenge to both observation and theory , and is crucial to understand the thermal history of the universe and galaxy formation .",
    "the igm has various direct observable tracers .",
    "( 1 ) neutral hydrogen absorbs background light of quasars and produces the lyman-@xmath16 forest .",
    "( 2 ) ionized electrons have thermal and peculiar motions and are capable of scattering cmb photons and generate secondary cmb temperature fluctuations , which are known as the thermal and kinetic sunyaev zeldovich effects ( sz effect ) , respectively .",
    "their precision measurements are becoming routinely available with the devoted cmb experiments such as amiba @xcite and sza ( sunyaev zeldovich array ) .",
    "( 3 ) ionized electrons and protons interact with each other and emit x - rays through thermal bremsstrahlung and contribute to the soft x - ray ( @xmath17 kev ) background ( xrb ) .",
    "several other tracers have been proposed , including x - ray absorption techniques @xcite , but they depend strongly on chemical compositions , and would be difficult to associate with direct igm properties .",
    "these tracers probe different igm phases and help to extract the igm state .",
    "for example , the xrb flux upper limits place constrain on the gas clumpyness and suggest a potentially strong role of feedback @xcite .    among these tracers ,",
    "the sz effect is a particularly powerful igm probe .",
    "( 1 ) it provides a complete sample of the intergalactic medium .",
    "all free electrons participate in thomson scattering and contribute to the sz effect .",
    "the thomson optical depth from the epoch of reionization @xmath18 to the present is @xmath19 , which means that about @xmath20 of cmb photons have been scattered by electrons .",
    "since the number of cmb photons is much larger than the baryon number and the ionization fraction of our universe is larger than @xmath21 , most baryons contribute to the sz effect .",
    "compton scattering does not depend on redshift and is not affected by distance or the expansion of the universe .",
    "so , the sz effect can probe the distant universe .",
    "furthermore , the sz effect does not strongly depend on gas density and probes a large dynamic range of baryon fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray emission measure depends on density squared , and primarily probes the densest igm regions at low redshift .",
    "the lyman-@xmath16 forest probes the neutral igm , which in ionization equilibrium depends also on the square of the baryon density . the neutral fractions only accounts for a tiny fraction of total baryons . extrapolations over many orders of magnitude",
    "are required to understand the bulk of the baryons .",
    "( 2 ) it is straightforward to understand . the simple dependence of the sz effect on the ionized gas pressure or momentum does not put as stringent requirement on simulation resolution , nor as accurate an understanding of the gas state such as metalicity , temperature , velocity and ionization equilibrium , as x - rays and lyman-@xmath16 properties do .",
    "pressure is the total thermal energy content of the gas , and finite volume flux conservative simulations are particular amenable to its modelling .",
    "it is also easier to model analytically .",
    "( 3 ) it has strong observational potential . in this paper",
    "we will primarily consider the thermal sz effect , which is easier to observe .",
    "its unique dependence on frequency allows us in principle to disentangle the sz effect from the contamination of the primary cmb and other noise sources @xcite .",
    "hereafter , if not otherwise specified , the sz effect always means the thermal sz effect .    in sz observations ,",
    "all redshifts are entangled and smear some key information of the intervening igm : its spatial distribution and time evolution .",
    "these properties around redshift @xmath22 are sensitive to many cosmological parameters and thus potentially promising to break degeneracies in cosmologies from the primary cmb experiments .",
    "one can hope to resolve the equation of the state of the dark energy .",
    "we are currently performing simulations for different cosmologies , which are degenerate in the primary cmb , to test the potential of such a procedure @xcite .",
    "if combined with other observations , the sz effect will become even more powerful .",
    "for example , with the aid of a galaxy photometric redshift survey , the evolution of the 3d gas pressure power spectrum and its cross correlation with the galaxy distribution can be extracted @xcite .",
    "the above analysis depends on a detailed quantitative theoretical understanding of the sz statistics .",
    "analytical approaches considered in the past strongly depend on various assumptions .",
    "the press - schechter approach as adopted by @xcite requires ad hoc models for the gas profile in halos , whose shape and evolution are uncertain .",
    "the hierarchical method as proposed by @xcite strongly depends on the gas - dark matter correlation , which is also poorly understood .",
    "these estimates can be significantly improved by high - resolution simulations .",
    "but past simulation results @xcite disagreed on both amplitude and shape of the sz power spectrum ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "simulation resolution may play a key role in this discrepancy since the sz effect is sensitive to small structures , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "differences between code algorithms may also cause part of the discrepancy . to address these problems , we ran the largest adaptive sz simulation to date , a direct @xmath0 moving mesh hydro ( mmh ) code @xcite simulation , to reinvestigate the sz statistics .",
    "for a better understanding of numerical and code issues in the sz effect , our group is carrying out a series of simulations with identical cosmological parameters and initial condition but using different codes with different resolutions @xcite .    apart from simulation issues , a problem that has received little attention is analysis strategies for sz data .",
    "several interferometric arrays such as amiba and sza are under construction , but detailed data analysis models are still in their infancy . with our simulated sz maps , we can estimate the sensitivity and accuracy of sz observations . given a sky scan rate , how accurately can the sz power spectrum be measured ?",
    "how many cluster can be found ?",
    "how accurately can the sz decrement be determined for individual clusters ?",
    "what are optimal strategies for these measurements ? in this paper , we will take amiba as our target to address these questions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : application ] , we describe the sz effect , its statistics and our method to analyze these statistics .",
    "we then present our simulation results of these statistics and possible constrain from observations (  [ sec : simulation ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : amiba ] we simulate amiba driftscan observations to estimate the accuracy of amiba measurement of these statistics .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the thermal sz effect causes cmb temperature and intensity fluctuations in the sky . at a given position given by a unit vector @xmath23 pointing from the earth to some point on the sky , the fractional change in the cmb intensity",
    "@xmath24 depends on both the observing frequency @xmath25 and the integral of the gas pressure along the line of sight @xcite : @xmath26.\\ ] ] for the cmb intensity , the spectral dependence for inverse compton scattering off non - relativistic electrons is described by @xmath27\\right)$ ] where @xmath28 ghz .",
    "the corresponding fractional change in cmb temperature @xmath29 is then : @xmath30=-2y\\left(2-x/[2\\tanh(x/2)]\\right ) .\\ ] ] in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 reaches the highest response , @xmath34 at @xmath35 ghz , which is well matched to the amiba frequency range of 80 - 100 ghz .",
    "@xmath36 monotonously decreases with frequency .",
    "we show @xmath33 and @xmath36 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sx ] ) where the frequency responses of various experiments which already have the cmb observation data at small angular scales ( @xmath37 ) such as atca @xcite , bima @xcite , cbi , suzie @xcite and vla @xcite are shown .",
    "the gas pressure dependence is described by the compton @xmath38 parameter @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the temperature , number density and pressure of free electrons , respectively .",
    "@xmath43 is the proper distance interval along the path of cmb photons .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 have their usual meanings as the thomson cross section , electron mass and the speed of light .",
    "since only free electrons participate in thomson scattering of the cmb photons , the integral is cut off at the epoch of reionization @xmath47 .",
    "some important statistics of the sz effect immediately come to mind .",
    "the first order quantity is @xmath48 , the mean @xmath38 parameter averaged over the whole sky , which measures the total thermal energy content of the universe .",
    "the angular variation in @xmath38 can be parameterized by the two point correlation function of the temperature fluctuation @xmath49 , or equivalently the angular power spectrum @xmath50 . for a gaussian random field",
    ", these two parameters would describe the statistics completely .",
    "since the sz effect is dominated by non - linear structures , non - gaussianity may be significant .",
    "so we investigate higher order statistics such as the skewness and kurtosis of the @xmath38 parameter to quantify the non - gaussianity .",
    "the sz effect contains contributions from all redshifts and it is challenging to recover the smeared redshift information . we have shown that cross correlating the sz effect with a galaxy photometric redshift survey , we can infer the redshift resolved igm pressure - galaxy cross correlation and the igm pressure auto correlation @xcite .",
    "this method is robust , but does not capture all the information in the sz observation . in this paper , we utilize the one point distribution function ( pdf ) of the @xmath38 parameter and the distribution of peaks in @xmath38 to extract more information .    since smoothing is always present for a real experiment with a finite beam , we calculate the statistics of the @xmath38 parameter smoothed on a given angular scale @xmath51 .",
    "if we are interested in virialized objects , for example clusters and groups of galaxies , we would expect them to be peaks in the smoothed or filtered @xmath38 maps .",
    "@xmath52 , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of peaks with smoothed @xmath38 parameter bigger than certain value @xmath53 , is the raw observable .",
    "the @xmath53 cdf is the sz analog to a luminosity function .",
    "if we choose a top hat window so that the observation cone is large enough to include an entire object such as a cluster and is small enough that typically no more than one such object can be found along each cone , then when the cone is centered at the center of each object , a peak @xmath54 appears in the smoothed map .",
    "this @xmath53 is directly related to the total gas mass and temperature of individual object . assuming a halo to be isothermal , the total mass @xmath55 of a halo is related to the gas temperature @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is the mass contained in a @xmath59 sphere of the universe of mean density today , which is roughly the mass scale of clusters .",
    "@xmath60 is the corresponding temperature of a halo with mass @xmath61 at redshift @xmath62 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the solid angle of the cone , @xmath65 is the gas fraction of halos and @xmath66 is the angular diameter distance . for clusters and groups ,",
    "the typical angular size at @xmath67 is about @xmath68 .",
    "for the present cluster number density @xmath69 @xcite , the average number of clusters in a cone with angular radius @xmath70 projected to @xmath71 is about one allowing for the evolution of cluster number density .",
    "so , the size of the smoothing scale for the peak analysis should be between these two scales . in this case , the @xmath52 is just the number of halos with @xmath72 , which is given by : @xmath73 @xmath74 is the halo comoving number density distribution function and is well described by the press - schechter formalism @xcite .",

    "( [ eqn : cdf ] ) has two applications .",
    "firstly , given a sz survey and the best constrained cosmological parameters as determined by cmb experiments , type @xmath80 sn , weak lensing , etc . and a sz survey , the only unknown variable in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : cdf ] ) is @xmath81 , which then is uniquely determined .",
    "@xmath82 is robustly predicted since it is mainly determined by @xmath83 through hydrostatic equilibrium and has only weak dependence on the thermal history .",
    "for example , comparing the cluster temperature function as inferred from simulations with the press - schechter formalism , @xcite found that @xmath84 for a @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "the above relation is sufficient to extract the evolution of the gas fraction @xmath65 , which is very sensitive to the thermal history .",
    "for example , non - gravitational energy injection decreases @xmath65 .",
    "secondly , the number of clusters strongly depends on cosmology , as characterized by @xmath85 .",
    "given a good understanding of cluster temperature and gas fraction , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : cdf ] ) allows one to constrain cosmological parameters . in combination with the measurement of cluster redshifts",
    ", this method is more sensitive @xcite . in  [ sec : amiba ] , we will study the statistics of these peaks for maps filtered in optimal ways to measure clusters of galaxies .    with the measurement of the cluster sz temperature distortion and",

    "the only uncertainties in this relation are the intracluster gas profile and metalicity which affects the x - ray emissivity .",
    "these properties could be modelled and are potentially observable . in this sense",
    ", the sz effect can be used as a cosmological distance indicator @xcite .",
    "since dark energy dominates at low redshift where the sz observation and x - ray observation of clusters are relatively straightforward , sz clusters are a potential probe to constrain the equation of state for the dark energy .",
    "in this section , we describe our sz simulation used to investigate the above statistics .",
    "we will also use our simulation to provide sz maps for our estimation of the sensitivity of upcoming sz experiments (  [ sec : amiba ] ) and its effect on data analysis strategies .",
    "we used a moving mesh hydrodynamics ( mmh ) code @xcite .",
    "it features a full curvilinear total - variation - diminishing ( tvd ) hydro code with a curvilinear particle mesh ( pm ) n - body code on a moving coordinate system .",
    "the full euler equations are solved in an explicit flux - conservative form using a second order tvd scheme .",
    "the curvilinear coordinates used in the code are derived from a gradient of the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "if @xmath92 are the cartesian coordinates , the curvilinear coordinates are @xmath93 .",
    "the transformation is completely specified by the single potential field @xmath94 .",
    "the potential deformation maintains a very regular grid structure in high density regions .",
    "the gravity and grid deformation equations are solved using a hierarchical multigrid algorithm for linear elliptic equations .",
    "these are solved in linear time , and are asymptotically faster than the fft gravity solver .",
    "at the same time , adaptive dynamic resolution is achieved . during the evolution",
    "any one constraint can be satisfied by the grid . in our case , we follow the mass field such that the mass per unit grid cell remains approximately constant .",
    "this gives all the dynamic range advantages of smooth particle hydro ( sph ) combined with the speed and high resolution of grid algorithms .",
    "the explicit time integration limits the time step by the courant condition . to achieve a reasonable run time , we limit the compression factor to a factor of 5 in length , corresponding to a factor of 125 in density .",
    "most sz contributions arise below such densities , giving a diminishing return to go to higher compression factors .",

    "the simulation used @xmath103 gb memory and took about three weeks ( @xmath104 steps ) on a 32 processor shared memory alpha gs320 at cita using open mp parallelization directives . during the simulation we store 2d projections through the 3d box at every light crossing time through the box .",
    "the projections are made alternatively in the x , y , z directions to minimize the repetition of the same structures in the projection .",
    "we store projections of thermal sz , kinetic sz , gas and dark matter densities . for the thermal sz , we store @xmath105 as given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : y ] ) .",
    "our 2d maps are stored on @xmath106 grids .",
    "as tested by @xcite , this preserves all the information down to the finest grid spacing . after the simulation",
    ", we stack the sz sectional maps separated by the width of simulation box , randomly choosing the center of each section and randomly rotating and flipping each section .",
    "the periodic boundary condition guarantees that there are no discontinuities in any of the maps .",

    "one typical thermal sz sky map and a kinetic sz sky map at the same field of view are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tszmap ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : kszmap ] , respectively . with these maps ,",
    "we calculate the sz power spectrum , the sz non - gaussianity , the @xmath38 pdf and @xmath53 cdf .",
    "the power spectrum in the rayleigh - jeans regime averaged over 40 maps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] .",
    "the thermal sz power spectrum is fairly flat , with a broad peak at @xmath111-@xmath112 and a typical fluctuation amplitude @xmath113 .",
    "it begins to dominate over the primary cmb at @xmath111 .",
    "the shape of the kinetic sz power spectrum is similar to the thermal one but the amplitude is about @xmath103 times smaller .",
    "comparing to available cmb observations , our thermal sz power spectrum is well below the upper limit ( @xmath114 confidence ) of atca @xcite , suzie @xcite and vla @xcite .",
    "@xmath50 at @xmath111 is consistent with recent indications from the cbi experiment @xcite and may suggests a high @xmath115 .",
    "but our result is higher than the bima @xmath116-@xmath117 result thought it is consistent with the upper limit ( @xmath114 confidence ) of the bima result@xcite .",
    "we will further discuss these issues below .",
    "published theoretical predictions differ a lot in both amplitude and shape ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "our power spectrum has a higher amplitude than all previous predictions .",
    "it is also significantly flatter at the range @xmath118 .",
    "the difference in amplitude can be explained by the strong dependence of the sz effect on cosmological parameters , especially @xmath119 .",
    "one expects @xmath120 and @xmath121 as predicted by various authors @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite used the same mmh code with lower resolution ( @xmath122 ) to simulate a universe with @xmath123 .",
    "this @xmath119 difference accounts for a factor of @xmath124 difference in the mean @xmath48 estimation and @xmath125 difference in the @xmath50 estimation . after accounting for these effects ,",
    "our power spectrum is consistent with theirs at small angular scales ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "but the difference in shape can not be explained in this way .",
    "for example , even after accounting for the effect of cosmological parameters , our power spectrum is still much larger at large angular scales ( @xmath127 ) than that of @xcite ( at @xmath127 , @xmath128 times larger ) .",
    "this flatness behavior may be a manifestation of the resolution effect .",
    "we notice that there are numerous high @xmath38 regions of arcminute or sub - arcminute scales in sz maps as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tszmap ] . to quantify this phenomenon",
    ", we show the dependence of @xmath129 on smoothing angular size @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : peak ] ) .",
    "@xmath129 is a measure of number of structures with angular size larger than or comparable to @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig : peak ] shows that when the smoothing scale increases from @xmath130 to @xmath68 , @xmath52 drops significantly in high @xmath38 regions . this behavior suggests the existence of numerous sub - arcminute , high @xmath38 structures in sz maps .",
    "higher resolution reveals more such structures .",
    "increasing in the number of these objects increases the amplitude of the power spectrum while making the power spectrum flatter around the peak .",
    "the first effect is obvious and the second one can be explained by the press - schechter picture .",
    "the sz power spectrum is dominated by the halo gas pressure profile @xmath131 at all interesting angular scales @xcite . for a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , @xmath132 .",
    "its projection along the line of sight then has a @xmath133 radial dependence , which produces an angular auto correlation function of shape @xmath134 .",
    "so the resulting power spectrum is nearly flat . a more accurate way to see",
    "the flatness behavior is to adopt the limber s equation . the 3d gas pressure power spectrum @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the fourier transform of the gas pressure profile @xmath137 .",
    "from limber s equation , @xmath138 , thus @xmath139 . here , @xmath140 is the redshift dependence of the sz effect .",
    "the halo mass function also plays a role for the flat power spectrum .",
    "since sis profile does not apply to the core of halos , a given cluster is no longer sis at scales smaller than its core size .",
    "smaller clusters take over and extend the flat power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum in our simulation clearly shows this flatness and suggests the role of these sub - arcminute halos .",
    "these halos also explain the discrepancy between our simulation and analytical predictions .",
    "@xmath68 corresponds to the comoving size @xmath141 mpc for @xmath142 where the dominant sz contribution comes from .",
    "this physical size corresponds to groups of galaxies .",
    "current predictions from the press - schechter picture assume a lower mass limit cutoff corresponding to the mass scale of groups . in the hierarchical method",
    ", the gas window function is a free parameter , which has an implicit dependence on this lower mass cutoff ( they can be related by the gas density dispersion ) .",
    "the cut off for contributions from groups of galaxies in analytical models results in a smaller @xmath48 and power spectrum .",
    "if only gravitational heating is included , high mass halos and low mass halos should have comparable gas fractions .",
    "the press - schechter formalism predicts many more halos towards the low mass end , so one expects pure gravity simulations to have increasing power spectra with increasing high resolution .",
    "non - gravitational heating avoids such a divergence .",
    "as described in the halo model of @xcite , non - gravitational heating has two effects .",
    "firstly , the energy injection makes the halo gas less clumpy .",
    "then the contribution to the power spectrum at smaller angular scales decreases relative to larger angular scales .",
    "this could explain the slightly differences between our simulation , cbi and bima results .",
    "secondly , the non - gravitational energy injection increases the thermal energy of the gas . for halos with mass lower than some threshold , the gravity can not hold gas and most of the gas is ejected from these halos , as must have been the case for galactic size halos .",
    "this provide a reasonable lower mass limit cut off in the press - schechter picture .",
    "thus the amplitude and shape of the sz power spectrum is a sensitive measurement of the non - gravitational energy injection . to obtain a better understanding of the sz effect , other physicical processes such as radiative cooling need to be considered .",
    "since radiative cooling through thermal bremsstrahlung is a @xmath143 process , it becomes relevant only at scales @xmath144 kpc , which corresponds to @xmath145 .",
    "these angular scales are not observable by any planed experiments , so we neglect the discussion of radiative cooling in this paper . our current simulation has reached the resolution needed to see the contribution from small halos and the predicted sz amplitude is already near the observed values .",
    "we expected to be able to observe the effects of non - gravitational heating from galaxy winds and other sources in the upcoming experiments .    in order to solve the discrepancy problem completely ,",
    "differences between codes must be considered .",
    "our group is currently running different codes with identical initial condition , identical cosmological parameters and various resolutions from @xmath146 to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "our prediction is consistent with the bima @xmath114 confidence result .",
    "but the comparison between observations and theoretical predictions needs further investigation . on the simulation part ,",
    "as we discuss above , the detailed normalization depends on @xmath119 , non - gravitational heating and resolution effects .",
    "observations will put strong constrains on these aspects . on the observational part ,",
    "the bima result needs to be reconsidered .",
    "it covers the sky where no strong sz temperature distortion due to known galaxy clusters exists .",
    "since clusters contribute a significant if not dominant fraction to the sz power spectrum , the bima result may be smaller than the statistical mean value .",
    "furthermore , the error of the bima result is estimated under the gaussian assumption , but as we will see below , the sz effect is highly non - gaussian around the bima central multipole @xmath147 .",
    "the strong non - gaussianity increases the intrinsic error of the sz power spectrum measurement . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : ngs ] , the error in the power spectrum measurement caused by the sz effect is about @xmath148 times larger than the corresponding gaussian case .",
    "nontheless , these results demonstrate the convergence between theory and observation . in the near future ,",
    "routine and accurate measurement of the sz effect will be possible in random fields .",
    "it will put stronger requirement for our theoretical understanding of the sz effect and allows us to study the effects of non - gravitational heating , radiative cooling and the thermal history of the igm .",
    "in contrast to the primary cmb , the sz effect is non - gaussian , arising from the non - linearity of the intervening gas .",
    "this non - gaussianity affects the error analysis and may help to separate the sz effect from the primary cmb in observation . to quantify these effects , we smooth sz maps using a top hat window of radius @xmath51 and measure the kurtosis of the smoothed @xmath38 .",
    "the kurtosis @xmath149 is generally a function of smoothing scale . for a gaussian signal , @xmath150 .",
    "[ fig : ngs ] shows that @xmath151 at small scales as @xmath152 .",
    "this result is consistent with the prediction from our hierarchical model approach of the sz effect @xcite .",
    "we predicted , at small angular scales , @xmath153 .",
    "here , @xmath154 is a hierarchical model coefficient @xcite and @xmath155 is the gas density dispersion at @xmath156 . at large angular scales",
    "@xmath157 , @xmath158 and reflects the strong non - gaussianity at this scale .",
    "it means that , at this angular scale , the dominant contribution to the @xmath38 parameter is from highly non - linear regions and there is still strong correlation at angular scales down to @xmath127 , as can be seen from the sz power spectrum .",

    "@xmath163 is averaged over all @xmath164 and all maps .",
    "we calculate @xmath165 indirectly through the map - map variance @xmath166 of @xmath50 , which is related to @xmath165 by @xmath167}$ ] .",
    "@xmath168 is the fractional sky coverage of each map which reflects the cosmic variance and @xmath169 is the @xmath170 bin size in our grid map with @xmath171 .",

    "we take amiba as our target to address these issues .",
    "amiba is a 19 element interferometer with @xmath204 meter dishes .",
    "all dishes are closely packed in three concentric rings .",

    ".    for closely packed interferometers observing such weak signals , the ground fringe can be a major source of noise . to eliminate the ground fringe , amiba plans to drift scan :",
    "the telescope is parked while the sky drifts by .",
    "this assures that the ground fringe remains constant with time .",
    "the mean value of each fringe is then subtracted from the scan , cleanly eliminating the ground .",
    "a field is mosaicked by a series of adjacent scans , and the most uniform coverage is achieved by incrementally offsetting the pointing center on each scan to yield a finely sampled 2-d map",
    ". the raw output of the experiment are correlations , two for each baseline , polarization and frequency channel , corresponding to the real and imaginary correlator outputs .",
    "we can think of each of these outputs to correspond to an image of the sky filtered through some anisotropic beam . as a first step",
    ", we can combine degenerate baselines and polarizations , reducing the 171 baselines to 30 non - degenerate baselines .",
    "since the cmb is expected to not be significantly unpolarized , we can combine the two polarization channels , leading to 60 raw maps per frequency channel .",
    "these maps can be merged optimally into one global map by convolving each map with its own beam , and scaling each map to the same noise level , and coadding these maps , resulting in a clean map .",

    "the factor of @xmath221 is due to the two polarizations of the amiba experiment . for a single dish of infinite aperture , with a single pixel detector",
    ", the window would be identically one : the scanned image is just the cmb distribution on the sky . since amiba has many detectors",
    ", one can combine them to either lower the noise , or to boost the signal .",
    "we have chosen to use the equivalent noise of a single pixel single dish experiment , and normalized the beam accordingly .",
    "we calculate the natural beam @xmath222 by equation ( 17 ) and ( 46 ) of @xcite .",
    "the natural beam in multipole space and real space are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] .",
    "the natural beam has a fwhm of @xmath223 .",
    "it peaks at @xmath224 . here",
    ", @xmath225 mm is the amiba operating wavelength and @xmath226 is the distance of the @xmath227th baselines .",
    "the first peak @xmath228 corresponds to the shortest base line @xmath229 m. at this angular scale , the sum of all the baselines improves throughput by a factor of almost three ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "this is analogous to having a nine pixel detector on a single dish .",
    "more detailed definitions of the beams and strategies are described in detail in @xcite .    in our simulated pipeline ,",
    "we add primary cmb map fluctuations to our simulated sky maps using cmbfast - generated @xcite power spectra with same cosmological parameters except for the use of cobe normalization for @xmath119 , which is slightly different from our simulation value .",
    "as we will show below , the primary cmb is not the main source of noise for the sz power spectrum measurement at amiba angular scales ( @xmath37 ) and is negligible in sz cluster searches .",
    "so the effect of this inconsistent @xmath119 is insignificant in our analysis .",
    "adding sz maps and cmb maps , we obtain simulated sky maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] ) . in these maps , sz structures , especially those caused by diffuse igm",
    "are superimposed with the primary cmb .",
    "we then convolve these maps with the natural beam .",
    "the beam function decreases quickly to zero towards large angular scales where the primary cmb dominates , so it efficiently filters most primary cmb structures larger than this scale .",
    "we then add the noise given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : noise ] ) to this map .",
    "the normalization in the beaming and filtering ( described below ) process is arbitrary .",
    "we choose the normalization in such a way that the power spectrum of the map at the scale of the peak response does not change after beaming or filtering .",
    "it corresponds to normalizing the global maximum of the beam function to be unity . under such normalization ,",
    "when we add instrumental noise to the simulated cmb+sz map , the noise is depressed by a normalization factor @xmath230 .",
    "our @xmath231 map has @xmath106 pixels , so the white instrumental noise dominates on small scales . for a @xmath232 hours@xmath233 survey , the dispersion of the noise temperature fluctuation @xmath234 .",
    "@xmath235 is the observing time for each pixel .",
    "so all signals are hidden under the instrumental noise .",
    "one needs further filtering to obtain an image that is not overwhelmed by the small scale noise . ignoring the cmb fluctuations , we know that point sources have the shape of the beam . a point",
    "sources optimized search would convolve the natural map with the shape of the beam , and peaks in this map correspond to the maximum likelihood locations of point sources .",
    "we can think of the cmb as a further source of noise , and filter that away as well . in this case , the filter depends on the ratio of cmb and noise amplitudes , i.e. the actual integration time .",
    "one can also optimize a filter for a structure of a known intrinsic shape .",
    "since clusters are approximately isothermal , a better filter would be one matched to the extended isothermal nature , where objects in the natural map have the shape of an isothermal sphere convolved with the natural beam . combining all these consideration ,",
    "the optimal filter for noise cleaning is given by @xmath236 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] ) .",

    "we discuss the simulated amiba measurement of the sz power spectrum and cluster searching in the next two subsections .",
    "one of the key goals of amiba is to measure the sz power spectrum . as discussed in ",

    "furthermore , combining the cross - correlation with photometric galaxy surveys , an sz survey can measure the igm pressure power spectrum as a function of redshift .",
    "this gives us access to the evolution of the igm state .",
    "for the purpose of the sz power spectrum estimation , the two noise sources , the primary cmb and the thermal instrument noise , are both gaussian .",
    "the intrinsic sz variance causes further error .",
    "the combined error for the power spectrum estimation is @xmath244 ^ 2}{(2   l+1)\\delta l   f_{\\rm sky}}}.\\ ] ] if the sz effect is gaussian ( @xmath178 ) , we recover the usual expression of the error .",
    "we take a large bin width @xmath245 to estimate the error .",
    "since the sz power spectrum is nearly flat in the range @xmath246 , this choice of bin size does not lose significant information . at large angular scales ( @xmath247 ) , the error from primary cmb dominates , and at small scales ( @xmath248 ) , the instrumental noise dominates . in the intermediate scales , the intrinsic error of the sz effect dominates .",
    "different errors have different dependences on the sky coverage . increasing @xmath249 while fixing the integration time , the errors from primary cmb and sz effect decrease but the the one from the instrumental noise increases",
    ", so there exists a optimal sky coverage for a given integration time .",
    "since the errors from primary cmb and sz effect are both scale as @xmath250 and the instrumental noise scales as @xmath251 , the minimum error is obtained when @xmath252 , which gives the optimal sky coverage . for @xmath7 hours of observing ,",

    "the observable is the direct sum of signal and noise , so the noise contribution can be subtracted linearly in the power spectrum .",

    "( 1 ) we estimate the accuracy of @xmath38 measurements by calculating the @xmath38 dispersion of noise @xmath269 .",
