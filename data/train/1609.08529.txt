    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is a hybrid imaging technique that combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the high resolution of ultrasound imaging .",
    "a short pulse of laser light is irradiated through the biological object of interest . due to the photoelastic effect",
    ", the object slightly expands and releases an ultrasound pressure that propagates through the space .",
    "the pressure is measured by transducers located on an observation surface @xmath0 . the initial pressure",
    "@xmath1 contains information regarding the inner structures of the object .",
    "one concentrates on finding @xmath1 from the observed data .    in this article",
    ", we are interested in a recent pat implementation , where there are multiple illuminations and an array of transducers is rotated around the object of interest to collect the data .",
    "we will discuss that setup shortly .",
    "meanwhile , let us introduce the standard setup of pat ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the object is irradiated once and the data is simultaneously measured by all transducers covering the observation surface @xmath0 . the mathematical model of pat",
    "is given then by the wave equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath2 u(x,0 ) = f(x ) , \\quad u_t(x,0)=0 , \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{r}^3 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , function @xmath3 represents the ultrasound speed , and the measured data is @xmath4 . one needs to solve the _ inverse problem _ : find @xmath5 given @xmath6 .",
    "this problem has been intensively studied from both theoretical and numerical perspectives ( see , e.g. , @xcite , just to name a few ) . common techniques to solve the aforementioned inversion problem include explicit inversion formula , time reversal , and series solution .",
    "let us also mention that pat in two dimensional space has also been well studied in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in many applications ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath3 is constant , in which case the data can be represented by the spherical radon transform @xmath7 of @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the spherical of radius @xmath10 centered at @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the pat reconstruction process reduces to the inversion of the spherical radon transform .",
    "when @xmath0 has special geometry such as a plane or ellipsoid , the spherical radon transform admits an explicit inversion formula ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding problem in the two dimensional space reduces to the inversion of the circular radon transform and has also been thoroughly studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "various technical constraints in the standard pat setup have motivated the development of newer pat technologies , where transducers are rotated around the object and data is acquired in time . in this article , we are interested in such a pat setup , which is currently being developed at tomowave laboratories ( see the company s webpage http://www.tomowave.com/ and the reference @xcite ) . in this setup , transducers are attached to a half - circle ring , placed vertically , and rotated around the object , see figure  [ fig : problem ] .",
    "after each illumination and measurement , the ring is slightly rotated . by rotating the ring , one can specify a sphere where the pressures are measured . under ideal conditions ,",
    "the full set of measurements is equivalent to that obtained using the standard setup with a spherical observation surface .",
    "[ fig : problem ]    however , in practice , the object that is being imaged may move during the measurement process , thereby presenting a significant challenge to achieving accurate tomographic reconstruction for dynamic pat systems . for example , in in - vivo imaging , the observations may be affected by the body s natural activities .",
    "if ignored , the resulting motion artifacts can inhibit reconstruction quality , thereby leading to incorrect image analysis and false diagnosis .",
    "although generic pre- or post - processing software may improve the visual appeal of reconstructions , in this paper , we consider a mathematical model that directly incorporates motion for more precise reconstruction . in x - ray ct , there has been work on estimating motion from the data ( e.g. , @xcite ) and on incorporating motion in reconstruction algorithms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there is currently no such work for pat reconstruction , where the forward model is different than that of x - ray ct .",
    "our work is the first attempt to fill this gap .",
    "[ [ overview - of - contributions ] ] overview of contributions + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this work has two main goals : i ) to establish a continuous approximate model of pat reconstruction under motion and to derive two uniqueness results for this theoretical model , and ii ) to propose an automatic and robust reconstruction technique for simultaneous estimation of the motion parameters and the desired image . for the first goal , we will recast the imaging procedure as a hybrid - type inverse problem and approximate it by a continuous model .",
    "we will make use of the theory of analytic wave front set and convex analysis to establish two uniqueness results .",
    "then , for the second goal , since current techniques for standard pat , such as inversion formula , time reversal , and series solution , do not seem feasible in our framework , our approach is to discretize the problem and employ algebraic techniques .",
    "we reformulate the problem of simultaneous estimation of motion parameters and reconstruction as a separable nonlinear least squares problem and exploit recent work on variable projection approaches @xcite , where regularization parameter selection can be done automatically . to handle large - scale problems and to avoid expensive computations , we make use of object - oriented programming and exploit matrix sparsity .    the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the mathematical model for pat reconstruction under motion . then , assuming that the object does not move so rapidly , we derive an approximate continuous mathematical model . in section  [",
    "s : unique ] , we provide theoretical results and properties that help in understanding the underlying problem . in section  [ sec : methods ] we describe an efficient computational approach to solve this problem .",
    "numerical results are provided in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] , and conclusions can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us begin by describing a mathematical model for pat with motion . for simplicity , in this article we consider the two - dimensional model .",
    "our ideas are extendable to the three dimensional problem ; however , the computation and analysis in that case are more involved and will be addressed in a followup paper .",
    "for the two dimensional problem , we consider the case of one detector rotating on the unit circle @xmath12 to measure the signal .",
    "let us assume that the object is supported inside the unit disc @xmath13 of @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 , @xmath16 , be @xmath17 locations distributed uniformly counterclockwise along the unit circle @xmath12 .",
    "fixing @xmath18 , for each moment @xmath19 , @xmath16 , one illuminates the object uniformly and measures the ultrasonic pressure at @xmath20 . assuming the speed of sound is constant , the data can be considered as the circular radon transform @xmath21 of @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the circle of radius @xmath10 centered at @xmath25 . here , @xmath22 is the object at moment @xmath26 .",
    "it is commonly assumed in imaging science that @xmath22 is a deformation of the steady state @xmath5 , which represents the object at rest .",
    "our problem now reads as follows :    _ find the function @xmath5 from @xmath27 _    the data of this problem is of hybrid - type : it is neither discrete ( due to the continuous variable @xmath10 ) nor continuous ( due to the discrete variable @xmath28 ) . since the desired function @xmath1 is of two continuous variables , the above problem is underdetermined and the kernel of the forward operator is nontrivial .",
    "another underlying challenge of the above reconstruction problem is ill - posedness , since the forward operator is a smoothing operator .",
    "moreover , the exact motion may not be known a priori .",
    "numerical techniques to handle these challenges will be discussed in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "assume that the object does not change rapidly and that the measurement time @xmath29 at each location is small .",
    "that is , the object does not change too much between two consecutive illuminations and measurements .",
    "moreover , we assume that the number of measurement locations is big enough . then , the data can be approximately considered as a function defined on @xmath30 . for each location @xmath31 ,",
    "the data is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the deformation of @xmath5 at time @xmath34 ( when the signal is measured at location @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , the continuous problem , incorporating time - varying deformations , can be stated as :    \\(p ) _ find @xmath5 given @xmath36 for all @xmath37 . _    here , the length of @xmath38 may be less than @xmath39 , when the rotation of the transducer does not make a complete circle . in that case",
    ", we assume that @xmath40 $ ] . on the other hand",
    ", the length of @xmath38 can also be bigger than @xmath39 , when the transducer makes more than a complete circle .",
    "however , we note that , in the latter case , @xmath33 and @xmath41 may not be the same , if the motion is not periodic .",
    "the deformation relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath33 is a topic that needs investigation . in this article , we follow the literature in dynamic tomography ( e.g. , @xcite ) and assume that .",
    "@xmath42 here for a fixed @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the location at moment @xmath34 ( when the signal is measured at location @xmath45 ) of the particle whose location is @xmath46 when the object is at rest .",
    "we will make the following assumptions on the deformation mapping @xmath47 :    1 .",
    "@xmath48 is a bijection from @xmath14 to @xmath14 .",
    "physically , this means two points can not deform into one location .",
    "then , @xmath49 has an inverse @xmath50 and @xmath51 2 .",
    "there is an open subset @xmath52 and a compact subset @xmath53 of the unit open disc @xmath13 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "that is , the the object is always contained inside @xmath53 during the imaging process .",
    "@xmath47 is an analytic function in both variables .",
    "this technical restriction allows us to obtain theoretical results .",
    "* in general , the deformation mapping @xmath47 may not be given .",
    "* we , instead , have to extract it from the measured data as well .",
    "this , in fact , poses the main challenges for pat with motions , both theoretically and computationally . in this article , we analyze problem  ( p ) under this circumstance .",

    "this is the so - called bolker condition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . *",
    "the right projection @xmath79 is a surjective submersion .",
    "intuitively , this condition means that all the singularities of @xmath5 are visible to the transform @xmath80 .",

    "however , it was not proved to be equivalent to ( a.5 ) , since it was irrelevant for its purpose .",
    "this fact will be proved in appendix  [ a : bolker ] for the sake of completeness .",
    "although it is not trivial to verify conditions ( b ) and ( c ) for a general family of deformations @xmath47 , it is possible for simple cases . in particular , in section  [ ss : stretching ] , we will present a model of deformation for which these conditions hold .      consider @xmath47 to be a family of vertical stretching in @xmath14 .",

    "[ l : ellip ] , we obtain ( noticing that @xmath278 since @xmath279 ) @xmath280 this is a contradiction to ( [ e : wfa ] ) .",
    "thus , the theorem is proved .",
    "we remark here some geometric restrictions in theorem  [ t : linearized ] may be relaxed ( or even removed ) . that can be done by obtaining a better version of lemma  [ l : ellip ] , which is a topic of upcoming research .    in summary",
    ", we have formulated an approximate continuous model for the problem of pat reconstruction with motion and proved two uniqueness results . in particular , we showed that when the family of deformations is known , the desired function @xmath5 is unique ( theorem  [ thm:1 ] ) , and we showed a one - to - one correspondence of the linearized problem for obtaining @xmath47 given @xmath5 , under mild assumptions ( theorem  [ t : linearized ] ) .",
    "these two results indicate that the reconstruction for pat with motion may be a stable problem , at least for the vertical stretching model presented in section  [ ss : stretching ] . in the next section",
    ", we will demonstrate this numerically .",
    "namely , we consider the discretized problem and describe numerical methods for simultaneous motion estimation and pat image reconstruction .",
    "in this section , we describe a computational approach to simultaneously estimate motion parameters and obtain a reconstruction for the discrete pat problem .",
    "we first recast the problem as a _",
    "separable _ nonlinear least squares problem .",
    "then we use variable projection methods @xcite to efficiently solve the problem by exploiting structure in the variables , i.e. , separating the linear and nonlinear variables .",
    "the work presented here builds on work presented in @xcite , but a significant contribution is our application to pat reconstruction problems under motion , where the particular forms of the forward model and the deformation model have not been considered in this framework before .",
    "previous work on using variable projection to improve pat reconstruction for transducers with inaccurate electric impulse responses can be found in @xcite . for computational efficiency , we take advantage of matrix sparsity and object - oriented programming for implementing projection operations , and we use a hybrid lsqr method for automatic regularization parameter selection @xcite .",
    "first , we formulate the discrete pat reconstruction problem with motion .",
    "assume @xmath3 is constant , then following the notation in section  [ sec : continuous ] , let @xmath281 be the discretized desired solution and let @xmath282 denote the locations of the transducers .",
    "let us consider the discrete version of the deformation model in section  [ ss : stretching ] .",
    "that is , we assume vertical stretching , which is a relatively realistic model for motion resulting from breathing . let @xmath283 be the stretch factor corresponding to the transducer at @xmath20 , so the @xmath284th transformed image is given by @xmath285 where @xmath286 performs one dimensional stretching / expansion as described in section  [ ss : stretching ] .",
    "we use bilinear interpolation to determine the weights in sparse matrix @xmath287 .    at each transducer location @xmath20 , assume there are @xmath288 radii and let @xmath289 be the corresponding projection matrix for that location ( i.e. , @xmath290 is the discrete spherical radon transform of @xmath291 on circles centered at @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus the observed spherical projection measurements for all @xmath288 radii are contained in vector @xmath292 where @xmath293 is additive gaussian noise that is independent and identically distributed .",
    "let @xmath294 and define @xmath295 then , the discrete mathematical model for pat reconstruction with motion is given by @xmath296 where the goal is to estimate the desired image @xmath291 as well as the motion parameters @xmath297 , given the observations @xmath298 in figure  [ fig : patproblem ] we provide a sample desired image @xmath291 which has @xmath299 pixels and corresponding pat observations @xmath300 where transducers are located at @xmath301 equidistant angles between @xmath302 and @xmath303 at @xmath304 degree intervals and each projection corresponds to @xmath305 radii .",
    "the test image used here was obtained from the auckland mri research group website @xcite .",
    "it is supported inside the square @xmath306 \\times [ -\\frac{1}{2 } , \\frac{1}{2}]$ ] . in our numerical experiment",
    ", the base line of the vertical stretch is @xmath307 and is assumed known .",
    "an illustration of vertical stretching is provided in figure  [ fig : motionillustrate ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig : reconimages ]",
    "in this paper , we considered the problem of motion estimation and correction in photoacoustic tomography .",
    "we established a hybrid - type model that incorporates parameterized motion deformations in the mathematical formulation .",
    "then we derived two uniqueness results for the new model , under mild assumptions .",
    "in particular , we showed that such results hold for one - dimensional stretching .",
    "then assuming that the parameterized motion model is a good approximation to the exact motion , we formulated the problem of simultaneous motion estimation and image reconstruction as a separable nonlinear least squares problem and described a computational approach for solving the problem .",
    "we note that the described variable projection approach can be extended to other deformation models ( e.g. , including rotation and translation ) @xcite .",
    "the benefits of our approach are that we exploit high - level structure to handle nonlinearities , we incorporate hybrid iterative methods for automatic regularization parameter selection , and we exploit matrix sparsity and use object - oriented programming for efficiency .",

    "that is , @xmath78 is an immersion if and only if @xmath104 is .    assuming that ( a.5 ) ( or , equivalently , ( b ) ) holds , it now remains to show that ( a.6 ) is equivalent to ( c ) .",
    "we first note that , condition ( b ) also implies @xmath79 is a submersion ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that ( c ) is equivalent to the fact that @xmath79 is surjective . therefore , ( c ) is now equivalent to ( a.6 ) , i.e. , @xmath79 is a surjective submersion .",
