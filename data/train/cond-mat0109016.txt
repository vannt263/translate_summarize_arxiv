    "the macroscopic quantum phenomenon in spin system at low temperature has attracted considerable attention both theoretically and experimentally for more than a decade@xcite .",
    "the magnetization vector in a single domain ferromagnetic(fm ) grain and the nel vector in a single domain antiferromagnetic(afm ) grain can tunnel from a metastable state to a stable one , which is called the macroscopic quantum tunneling(mqt ) , or display a coherent oscillation between two degenerate states , which results in the superposition of macroscopically distinguishable ( classically degenerate ) states ( the understanding of which is a long - standing problem in quantum mechanics ) and is called macroscopic quantum coherence(mqc ) . the geometrical phase ( known as the berry phase ) interference plays a crucial role in the mqc .",
    "the quenching of mqc can be interpreted by the quantum interference between tunneling paths of opposite windings which possess a phase with obvious geometric meaning@xcite .",
    "the quenching of mqc for half - integer spin has been shown physically to be related to kramers@xmath1 degeneracy , however , the effect of geometric phase interference is far richer than that .",
    "for example , when the external magnetic field is applied along the hard anisotropy axis , a new quenching of mqc occurs and is not related to kramers@xmath1 degeneracy since the external magnetic field breaks the time reversal symmetry@xcite .",
    "the zeeman energy of the biaxial spin particle associated with the external magnetic field produces an additional geometric phase of tunnel paths which leads to the quantum interference , and the tunnel splitting therefore oscillates with respect to the magnetic field .",

    "are expected to be a better candidate for the observation of macroscopic quantum phenomena than the fm particles .",
    "the quantum tunneling of the nel vector in afm particles has been well studied in terms of the idealized sublattice - model@xcite in which the external magnetic field does not play a role since the net magnetic moment vanishes .",
    "the biaxial afm particles with a small noncompensation of sublattices or in other words biaxial ferrimagnetic particles have to be considered in order to obtain the effect of the external magnetic field on the tunnel splitting .",

    "we investigate the effect of quantum phase interference at excited states for a biaxial ferrimagnetic particle in the external magnetic field applied along an arbitrary direction in the plane of hard and medium axis .",
