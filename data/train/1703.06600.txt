    "zero mean curvature surfaces in the lorentz - minkowski 3-space @xmath0 are smooth surfaces with mean curvature zero wherever the mean curvature is defined .",
    "having the mean curvature defined at all points is not expected , because these surfaces can change causal type , meaning that some parts may have spacelike tangent planes and other parts may have timelike tangent planes , with lightlike tangent planes at boundary points between these parts . an interesting aspect of these surfaces is precisely that they change causal type , often resulting in interesting singular and topological behaviors , and these surfaces have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "one of the main tools for the construction of such surfaces is based on the fact that fold singularities of spacelike maximal surfaces have real analytic extensions to timelike minimal surfaces @xcite .",
    "in contrast to minimal surfaces in the euclidean 3-space @xmath1 , the only known triply periodic zero mean curvature surfaces in @xmath0 were those in a 1-parameter family constructed in @xcite , while there are many known triply periodic minimal surfaces in @xmath1 , see for example @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to broaden our knowledge of triply periodic zero mean curvature surfaces in @xmath0 , and in this paper we construct a new 1-parameter family of triply periodic zero mean curvature surfaces in @xmath0 based on the conjugate surfaces of the triply periodic minimal surfaces in @xmath1 called the schwarz h surfaces .",
    "this is the main original result of this paper , and the family here is interesting because it exhibits both a change of causal type , and also a greater complexity than the previously known examples .",
    "the method we use to construct the family is essentially the same as in @xcite , but the surfaces here are less symmetric , and so the construction is more involved .",
    "it is expected that by using the method in this paper one could construct families of surfaces with more complicated topologies , based on the data of triply periodic minimal surfaces in @xmath1 constructed in @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that the family of surfaces we construct in this paper is a prototype for the study of the moduli space of triply periodic zero mean curvature surfaces .",
    "we remark that the surfaces constructed in this paper have the same topology and symmetry as schwarz rpd minimal surfaces , not schwarz h surfaces .",
