    "vw ari ( hd 15165 , bds 1269 ) is a remarkable visual binary system consisting of two components : vw ari a ( v=6.@xmath671 , a - type ) and its companion ( v=8.@xmath633 , f - type ) . the primary vw ari a is a multiperiodic pulsating star ( probably of @xmath7 sct - type ) having non - radial modes .",
    "this star shows the spectrum typical of very metal - deficient stars .",
    "the rather high @xmath8 value found for this star , makes it difficult to derive accurate elemental abundances .",
    "a first attempt was undertaken by andrievsky et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who showed that calcium and iron are strongly deficient in the atmosphere of vw ari a , while the secondary component possesses a solar - like chemical composition .",
    "such a strange discrepancy between the metallicities of the two components can be explained by several hypotheses .",
    "for example , these stars possibly do not constitute a physical pair or , in case they do , such an unusual stellar system could be formed as a result of stellar capture .",
    "nevertheless , taking into account that 1 ) with a rather high probability vw ari is a binary system and 2 ) the probability of stellar capture in the field is too small , we propose that the difference in chemical composition of both components could appear simply due to the peculiar evolution of vw ari a as a @xmath2 boo - type star .    the atmospheres of this type of stars are known to be strongly deficient in some heavy metals , while cno - elements exhibit solar - like abundances ( see e.g. strenburg , 1993 ) .    to check this hypothesis , we performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of vw ari ( primary component of the system ) based on the spectral synthesis technique .",
    "seven ccd spectra have been obtained on 21 november 1994 with the chelle spectrometer lynx ( modified version : 29 spectral orders with the length of each order @xmath9 60  ) on the 6-m telescope ( special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences , russia , northern caucasus ) . the detailed description of the spectrometer is given by panchuk et al .",
    "the resolving power was 24000 , s / n @xmath9 100 .",
    "the spectral region was 5035 - 7185  .",
    "the epochs at mid - exposures were the following : jd 2449670 + 1 ) 8.158 , 2 ) 8.165 , 3 ) 8.186 , 4 ) 8.215 , 5 ) 8.232 , 6 ) 8.247 , 7 ) 8.263 .",
    "all spectra have been reduced using the dech20 code ( galazutdinov , 1992 ) , which includes extraction of spectra from images , dark and cosmic hits subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration , etc .",
    "the effective temperature and gravity for vw ari a ( t@xmath0=7200 k , @xmath1=3.7 ) were estimated using the photometric indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the calibration by kurucz ( 1991 ) .",
    "we adopted a microturbulent velocity of 3 kms@xmath12 , which is appropriate for a - f main - sequence stars , and @xmath13  kms@xmath12 was taken from abt ( 1980 ) .",
    "the starsp code ( tsymbal , 1996 ) was applied to derive the elemental abundances .",
    "the atmosphere model was interpolated from kurucz s ( 1992 ) grid .",
    "the input oscillator strengths of the investigated lines and blends were initially corrected by comparison of the solar synthetic spectrum ( solar model from kurucz s grid , @xmath14  kms@xmath12 and solar abundances from grevesse and noels , 1993 ) with the solar flux spectrum ( kurucz et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the resulting abundances were found by means of the optimal fitting of the synthetic spectrum to the observed one .",
    "they are given in table 1 .",
    ".abundances for vw ari a [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the abundance pattern in the atmosphere of vw ari resembles that of @xmath2 boo - type stars ( see , e.g. strenburg , 1993 , andrievsky et al . , 1998 ) : normal abundances ( or slight underabundances ) of carbon and oxygen and strong deficiency of other elements .",
    "an additional confirmation that vw ari could be a @xmath2 boo star is its position in @xmath15 diagrams .",
    "this star possesses photometric characteristics which place it exactly in the region occupied by @xmath2 boo stars .    supposing that vw ari belongs to the @xmath2 boo group , one can also easily explain the remarkable difference between the metallicities of this star and of its companion f - star with solar - like abundances ( andrievsky et al . , 1995 ) .",
