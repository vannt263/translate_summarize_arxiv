    "gravitational lensing provides us a powerful probe of the mass distributions of the universe . by comparing the lensing probabilities predicted by various cosmological models and the density profiles of lenses with observations ,",
    "we are able to test the mass distribution of dark matter ( cdm ) halos and in particular , the inner density slope in the sense that the jvas / class radio survey @xcite has provided us the observed lensing probabilities at small image separations ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is well known that , cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has become the standard theory of cosmological structure formation .",
    "the @xmath2cdm variant of cdm with @xmath14 appears to be in good agreement with the available data on large scales @xcite .",
    "on smaller ( sub - galactic ) scales , however , there seems to be various discrepancies .",
    "issues that have arisen on smaller scales have prompted people to propose a wide variety of alternatives to the standard cdm model , such as warm dark matter ( wdm ) and self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) .",
    "now that problems arise from galaxy - size halos and the centers of all dark matter halos , high - resolution simulations and observations are the final criterion .",
    "recent highest - resolution simulations appear to be consistent with nfw @xcite down to scales smaller than about 1 kpc .",
    "meanwhile , a large set of high - resolution optical rotation curves has recently been analyzed for low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , which suggests that the nfw profile is a good fit down to about 1 kpc .",
    "although further simulations and observations , including the observations of co rotation curves @xcite , may help to clarify the issue , it is likely that both wdm and sidm are probably ruled out , while the predictions of @xmath2cdm at small scales may be in better agreement with the latest data .",
    "unfortunately , if dark halos are modelled with nfw profile on all mass scales , they will produce too few small angular separation images in @xmath2cdm model as compared with the results of jvas / class @xcite . a possible solution to",
    "the problem is to modify the inner structure of dark halos by introducing baryonic cooling and compression @xcite .",
    "namely , there exist two types of dark halos : small mass halos ( galactic size ) with a steep inner density slope ( singular isothermal sphere , sis ) and very massive halos ( e.g. galaxy clusters ) with a shallow inner slope ( nfw ) .",
    "this can reproduce the observational data of jvas / class @xcite .",
    "one may also consider a unified model in which dark halos are composed of an nfw - like component and a bulge component for galaxies as lenses@xcite .",
    "if the nfw profile is believed to be universal , this model allow us to constrain the structure of the galactic centers using the strong lensing surveys .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the plausibility of the nfw+bulge model by fitting the observational data of jvas / class in a much more accurate way to improve our previous work @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize the importance of the flux density ratio @xmath1 of the two images produced by a central point mass in each galaxy for the predicted results .    in our model , there are two important issues when galactic bulges are involved : first , the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of most galaxies appears by now firmly established ( melia & falcke 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "smbh masses are estimated to be in the range @xmath15 , and are correlated with the masses and luminosities of the host spheroids and , more tightly , with the stellar velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution observational data give @xmath16@xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite finds a relation between masses @xmath7 of smbhs and the total gravitational masses of the dark matter halos as @xmath17 . since these correlations extend well beyond the direct dynamical influence of the smbh it seems likely that there is a close link between the formation of both the smbh and its galaxy @xcite .",
    "so we can simply add galactic smbhs as point masses to the nfw density profile when we calculate lensing probability .",
    "second , galactic bulges , in which multiple black holes may form and inhabit ( e.g. , haehnelt & kauffmann 2002 ) , can also contribute to the lensing probabilities at small image separations .",
    "since light rays are affected by the mass within the sphere of their impact distances , we can attribute the light deflections induced by such a mass to an effective point mass , which is referred to as @xmath4 in this paper .",
    "we thus avoid the complexity of gas compression and mass distributions of galactic bulges .",
    "of course , we are unable to reveal the detail structures of the inner part of galaxies at the same time .",
    "we argue that this may be an adequate way if we want to compare our predictions with the results of strong gravitational lensing survey .",
    "so , the total central pointlike masses by including central smbhs and bulges range from @xmath18",
    ". the upper limit of @xmath4 is @xmath19 because the bulge mass correlates linearly with smbh mass as @xmath16 .",
    "we choose the most generally accepted values of the parameters for the @xmath2cdm cosmology , in which , with usual symbols , the matter density parameter , vacuum energy density parameter and hubble constant are respectively : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the nfw density profile is @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants .",
    "we can define the mass of a halo to be the mass within the virial radius of the halo @xmath26 : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the concentration parameter , for which we have used the fitting formula given by @xcite .",
    "the surface mass density for a halo as lens is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the position vector in the lens plane .",
    "@xmath34 is the two dimensional dirac - delta function , and @xmath35 is the surface mass density for an nfw profile .",
    "@xmath4 is a point mass ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 times the mass @xmath7 of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) inhabiting the center of each galaxy , to describe the contributions of galactic central smbhs and galactic bulges to lensing probabilities .",
    "for galaxy cluster , @xmath36 .",
    "the lensing equation for this model is then @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the position vector in the source plane , in which @xmath40 and @xmath41 are angular - diameter distances from the observer to the source and to the lens , respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out that , since the surface mass density is circularly symmetric , we can extend both @xmath42 and @xmath43 to their opposite values in eq.([lq ] ) for convenience .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 is independent of @xmath42 , in which @xmath45 is critical surface mass density .",
    "the term @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the reduced mass of an nfw halo defined as @xmath48 , stands for the contribution of a point mass @xmath4 , and , of course , @xmath49 for cluster - size lenses .",
    "the function @xmath50 stands for the contribution of the nfw halo , and it has an analytical expression originally given by @xcite .",
    "when the quasars at redshift @xmath51 are lensed by foreground cdm halos of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , the lensing probability with image separations larger than @xmath0 and flux density ratio less than @xmath1 is @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the proper distance from the observer to the lens located at redshift @xmath54 .",
    "the physical number density @xmath55 of virialized dark halos of masses between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is related to the comoving number density @xmath58 by @xmath59 , the latter is originally given by @xcite , and the improved version is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the current mean mass density of the universe , and @xmath62 is the mass function for which we use the expression given by @xcite . in this expression , @xmath63 , in which @xmath64 is the overdensity threshold for spherical collapse by redshift @xmath54 , and @xmath65 is the rms of present variance of the fluctuations in a sphere containing a mean mass @xmath56 .",
    "the overdensity threshold is given by @xmath66 for the @xmath2cdm cosmology @xcite , where @xmath67/[g(\\omega_{\\mathrm{m}})(1+z)]$ ] is the linear growth function of the density perturbation @xcite , in which @xmath68 and @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "when we calculate the variance of the fluctuations @xmath70 , we use the fitting formulae for cdm power spectrum @xmath71 given by @xcite , where @xmath72 is the amplitude normalized to @xmath73 given by observations .",
    "note that the mass of an nfw halo is taken to be the virial mass @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the average density within @xmath76 .",
    "the key step in working out the final results of lensing probabilities is how to calculate the lensing cross section @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in the lensing probabilities with image separations larger than a certain value @xmath0 ( ranging from @xmath78 arcseconds , for example ) and flux density ratio less than @xmath1 , the cross section should be defined under two conditions .",
    "the first condition is used to define the cross section of cluster - size nfw lenses , for which , multiple images can be produced only if @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the maximum value of @xmath43 when @xmath81 , which is determined by @xmath82 when @xmath49 in eq.([lq ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , because of the existence of the central point mass , theoretically , every galaxy - size lens will always produce two images .",
    "so the first condition fails in this case and we need the second condition to define the cross section of galaxy - size lenses , which is the allowed upper limit of flux density ratio of lensing images in any lensing survey experiments .",
    "so , the flux density ratio @xmath1 for the two images is just the ratio of the corresponding absolute values of magnifications @xcite , @xmath83 , where @xmath84=\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)_{x>0}$ ] and @xmath85=\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)_{x<0}$ ] .",
    "so @xmath80 is determined by @xmath86 . the cross section for images with a separation greater than @xmath0 and",
    "a flux density ratio less than @xmath1 is @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a step function , and @xmath89 is the minimum mass of halos above which lenses can produce images with separations greater than @xmath0 . from eq.([lq ] ) , an image separation for any @xmath43 can be expressed as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the image separation in lens plane for a given @xmath43 .",
    "so in eq.([cross ] ) , the source position @xmath92 , at which a lens produces the image separation @xmath0 , is the reverse of this expression .",
    "and @xmath93 is the separation of the two images which are just on the einstein ring ; @xmath94 is the upper - limit of the separation above which the flux ratio of the two images will be greater than @xmath1 .",
    "note that since @xmath95 ( @xmath47 ) is related to @xmath0 through @xmath96^{1/3})h^{-1}\\mathrm{mpc}$ ] @xcite , we can formally write @xmath97 , and determine @xmath89 for galaxy - size lenses by @xmath98 , and for cluster - size lenses by @xmath99 . in the latter case",
    "we have used the fact that the separation of the outermost images is insensitive to the value of @xmath43 in cluster - size nfw lenses .    to compare the predicted lensing probabilities with the combined data from jvas / class , magnification bias must be considered . for the jvas / class sample ,",
    "we use the result given by @xcite : @xmath100 , where @xmath101 .",
    "one major uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath102 by the nfw halo arises from the assignment of the concentration parameter @xmath103 to each halo of mass @xmath56 .",
    "there exist several empirical fitting formulae or analytic models to fulfill the task .",
    "however , for a given halo mass and redshift , there is a scatter in @xmath104 value that is consistent with a log - normal distribution with standard deviation @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "we take into account the scatter in @xmath103 by averaging the lensing probability with the log - normal distribution ( the right panel of figure [ fig1 ] and all the panels of figure [ fig2 ] )    another major uncertainty in predicting @xmath102 arises from the considerable uncertainty regarding the value of the cdm power spectrum normalization parameter @xmath10 , so it would be useful to consider the effect of varying this parameter within its entire observational range , roughly @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the lensing probabilities predicted by eq . ( [ prob1 ] ) and calculated from the combined jvas / class data are compared in fig.1 .",
    "since we are interested in the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath4 in matching the predicted results to observational data , we have calculated the lensing probabilities for four different values of @xmath1 and their corresponding values of @xmath4 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . we have assumed a  cooling mass \" of @xmath107 , above which the lenses are assigned the nfw profile and below which the lenses are the nfw+point mass .",
    "the predicted lensing probabilities are quite sensitive to @xmath108 , the value of @xmath108 used here is higher than those preferred by other authors @xcite . a lower value ( e.g. , @xmath109 ) requires a larger @xmath4 for each @xmath1 , however , this will not affect our conclusions , since our main goal is not to  measure \" the exact value of @xmath4 . the combined jvas / class survey",
    "is now completed , a subset of 8,958 sources form a well - defined statistical sample containing 13 multiply - imaged sources ( lens systems ) suitable for analysis of the lens statistics .",
    "one of the four observational selection criteria for this  well - defined \" sample is : the image components in lens systems must have separations @xmath110 arcsec and the ratio of the flux densities of the brighter to the fainter component in double - image systems must be @xmath111 @xcite . the observed lensing probabilities can be easily calculated : @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the number of lenses with separation greater than @xmath0 in 13 lenses .",
    "@xmath114 is plotted as a histogram in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "first of all , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , when averaged over concentration parameter @xmath103 with the log - normal distribution ( right panel ) , the probabilities are increased considerably at larger image separations and only slightly increased at smaller separations for all cases , and the  scatter \" among the four cases is reduced .",
    "so the scatter in @xmath103 should be considered when one uses the nfw profile to constrain some related parameters .",
    "it is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that , for low flux ratios ( @xmath111 , as for the jvas / class survey ) , the nfw plus a single smbh model produces far too few small separation lenses ( the dash - dot - dot - dot line in the figure ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that , among the 22 confirmed lenses in jvas / clas , none has a fainter image very close to the center of the lens @xcite . in other words , up to date strong gravitational lensing effect of a single smbh has not been found .",
    "a larger flux ratio requires a smaller fraction of the bulge mass as a point mass .",
    "it s interesting to note that , when @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and when no scatter in @xmath103 is included ( the dotted line in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the predicted lensing probability fit quite well the jvas / class results .",
    "as pointed out earlier , this conclusion can be equivalently obtained with the model of two populations of halos , the combination of sis and nfw , when no constraints on flux density ratio @xmath1 are taken into account ( i.e. , @xmath117 . note that , the flux density ratios with values as high as @xmath118 and infinity have approximately the same effect on the predicted probabilities ) .",
    "however , since the flux density ratio for the well - defined jvas / class sample is limited to @xmath119 , the above mentioned good fit can not be regarded as reflecting the real nature of cdm halos . in fact , to match the jvas / class results , for @xmath111 , about @xmath9 of the bulge mass is required as a point mass ( i.e. , @xmath120 , the solid lines in fig . [ fig1 ] ) , while for @xmath121 , only @xmath122 of bulge mass is needed .",
    "this difference is very important when one attempts to use the observational results of jvas / class to constrain the density profile of galactic bulge and/or dark matter halos .",
    "it s well known that , the flux density ratio will reduce the lensing cross section considerably .",
    "all the models without considering this would have overestimated the lensing probabilities . in our nfw + point mass model",
    ", we can adjust the value of the point mass to the corresponding flux density ratio to match the observational results , and will never fail .",
    "in the nfw+sis model , however , the contributions of sis to lensing probabilities can not be changed .",
    "put in another way , after considering the flux density ratio limited by jvas / class , nfw+sis model can not reproduce the observational results , not even marginally , if some other parameters like @xmath123 are the same as used here .",
    "we have noted that , the solid lines in both panels of fig . [ fig1 ] can only marginally fit the observations of jvas / class at larger image separations .",
    "but it is still acceptable , in the sense that , the curve is lower than the upper limit provided by the jvas / class survey for @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "we know that among the total of 22 confirmed    lens systems of the jvas / class survey , 21 of them have image separations between @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and one of them ( class b2108 + 213 ) has an image separation of @xmath127 @xcite . the null result of the jvas / class survey for @xmath124 means that the nfw profile is suitable for all mass sizes of halos , when a certain fraction of the mass of each galactic bulge is considered .",
    "although we believe that the reasonable match to the observations of jvas / class is @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( the solid line in each panel of fig . [ fig1 ] ) , it is helpful if we treat the four cases ( four upper lines matching the histogram ) as a whole to constrain the sensitive parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we plot in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the averaged lensing probability as a function of image separation @xmath0 .",
    "all the parameters are the same as those in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] except for @xmath10 , for which five different values within the entire observational range ( from 0.7 to 1.1 , as explicitly indicated ) have been investigated to see their effect on the predicted lensing probabilities .",
    "clearly , the larger values of @xmath10 will produce the higher probabilities . in the case of @xmath130 ,",
    "too few lenses are produced at small image separations , so a low value of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is unlikely .",
    "the best fit is @xmath131 .",
    "this result is very close to that obtained most recently by @xcite , in which @xmath10 is determined from the abundance of massive clusters at redshifts @xmath132 .",
    "our result is also in excellent agreement with that of @xcite(@xmath133 at @xmath134 ) suggested by the excess cosmic microwave background fluctuations detected on small scales by the cbi @xcite and the bima @xcite experiments .    in summary",
    ", strong gravitational lensing probability is quite sensitive to the cooling mass @xmath123 , concentration parameter @xmath103 , flux density ratio @xmath135 and the spectrum normalization parameter @xmath10 .",
    "including the scatter in @xmath103 in the calculations would increase the lensing probabilities considerably at larger image separations , while neglecting @xmath135 would overestimate the lensing probabilities . in our nfw + point mass model , @xmath9 of the galactic bulge mass is required as a point mass to match the jvas / class results ; the low values of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are ruled out , and the preferred value in our model is @xmath136 .",
