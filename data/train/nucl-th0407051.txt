    "in the framework of the `` cosmological concordance model '' , bbn probes the earliest times , but once @xmath0 is fixed , as now allowed by accurate cmb anisotropies analysis  @xcite , it is completely ruled by standard physics , at least in its minimal formulation , thus providing useful insights on a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological issues .",
    "as well known , the nuclide abundance predictions are mainly affected by the nuclear reaction uncertainties .",
    "the suggested range of @xmath0 and the low - energy nuclear data taken in the last decade justify a revision of the bbn network reliability , with respect to the one performed in the seminal paper by smith _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite : here we summarize our techniques and some results . for a detailed discussion of the issues presented here and of other refinements ( like a better treatment of the neutrino sector and of plasma and qed effects )",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the reaction rates are obtained as thermal averages of the relevant astrophysical factors @xmath1 , so the first and most critical step is how to combine the data @xmath2 of several experiments @xmath3 , each one affected in general by statistical , @xmath4 , and normalization errors , @xmath5 , in a meta - analysis where both the magnitude and the energy behavior of the @xmath1 have to be deduced .",
    "usually , different experiments disagree within the quoted errors , suggesting some systematic discrepancy , the bulk of which can be attributed to different normalizations .",
    "there is obviously no unique and unambiguous way to deal with such discrepancies and several methods appeared in the literature . in a recent one described in  @xcite ,",
    "both the errors are included in the covariance matrix entering the expression of the @xmath6 function to be minimized .",
    "this approach clearly takes into account the correlations between data of the same experiment , but as addressed in  @xcite , a bias is thus introduced , leading to a systematic underestimate of the fitted functions , that typically pass below the majority of the data , and possibly affecting the nuclide predictions and errors estimates .    in our method , that generalizes",
    "the approach suggested in  @xcite , the @xmath6 is calculated as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the data point at the energy @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the theoretical value of the astrophysical factor , depending on some parameters @xmath11 to be determined together with the renormalizing factors @xmath12 by standard minimization procedures .",
    "the covariance matrix was built by considering the statistical errors only and @xmath4 were unavailable in a separate form . ] , while different renormalization factors were allowed for each data set ; the introduction of @xmath13 disfavors renormalizations greater than the estimated @xmath5 .",
    "the best - fit curves thus produced pass _ through _ the data , closer to the best determinations , as one would expect from an unbiased estimator ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ddp],[fig : ddn ] ) .",
    "in such an approach , the bulk of the systematic uncertainty has been taken into account and the residual discrepancies can be considered as due to some unidentified / underestimated source of error in one or several experiments .",
    "then , we simply inflated the calculated error by a scale factor @xmath14 , as prescribed by the particle data book  @xcite . using this prescription , the overall normalization uncertainty can not be clearly worse than the one determined by the most accurate experiment : this error was quadratically added to the previous one .",
    "finally , a typical renormalization factor @xmath15 was calculated , to give an idea of the current disagreement on the scale of @xmath1 among several experiments @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the number of data and @xmath19 the contribution to the @xmath6 of the k - th data set , thus assigning a larger weight to the experiments closer to the fitted @xmath20 .    the rate @xmath21 was obtained by numerical integration of @xmath1 convolved with the boltzmann / gamow kernel @xmath22 @xmath23 and its error @xmath24 trough the standard error propagation as @xmath25 thus fully including the correlations among the fitted parameters .",
    "the uncertainties on the nuclides yields were finally obtained with a generalization of the linear propagation method described in  @xcite .    , but for the @xmath26h(d , n)@xmath27he process .",
    "different symbols are used to denote different data sets.,width=262 ]    , but for the @xmath26h(d , n)@xmath27he process .",
    "different symbols are used to denote different data sets.,width=260 ]",
    "in fig .  [ fig : li7 ] ( [ fig : be7 ] ) we plot the net contribution to the right - hand side of the leading and main sub - leading reactions to the synthesis and destruction of @xmath28li ( @xmath28be ) , obtained for the typical value @xmath29 . it is easily seen that the first stage of @xmath28li production around @xmath30 kev mainly proceeds through the @xmath31he(t,@xmath32)@xmath28li reaction , but @xmath28li is soon burned via @xmath28li(p,@xmath33)@xmath31he reaching a low plateau value .",
    "the final @xmath28li content is thus mainly given by the late @xmath28be ec decay : this isotope , synthesized via the key route @xmath31he(@xmath27he,@xmath32)@xmath28be , is less easily destroyed through the ( experimentally poorly known ) channels @xmath28be(n,@xmath33)@xmath31he and @xmath28be(d , p)2@xmath31he , or the two steps process @xmath28be(n , p)@xmath28li + @xmath28li(p,@xmath33)@xmath31he , now determined with good accuracy .",
    "the former two reactions are indeed responsible for the bulk of the @xmath28li error budget , at least if a conservative uncertainty of one order of magnitude is assumed .",
    "we also found that sub - leading processes as @xmath28li+p@xmath34 @xmath35be@xmath36 + 2 @xmath31he , often neglected in bbn studies , for which new measurements exists , are truly marginal , even if their little contribution to the final error is similar to the much widely treated @xmath31he(t,@xmath32)@xmath28li .",
    "the same is true e.g. for the other overlooked reactions @xmath37li(d , p)@xmath28li and @xmath37li(d , n)@xmath28be .",
    "we checked that only a handful of reactions dominate the error budget , and , apart for useful measurements of poorly known cross sections , a determination of _ both the magnitude and the shape _ of the @xmath26h(d , n)@xmath27he,@xmath26h(d , p)@xmath27h , @xmath31he(@xmath27he,@xmath32)@xmath28be reactions at the 1% accuracy level over _ all _ the interval of interest for the bbn ( say , up to @xmath38 2 mev ) could significantly improve the reliability of the predictions of both @xmath26h and @xmath28li . in these cases , indeed , the systematics coming from several experiments dominate the uncertainty , and more reliable data are needed , since even very detailed regression methods may fail in these cases . on the other hand , the bbn theory would surely benefit of refined studies of the @xmath31he and @xmath28li observational systematics , as well as from an increase in the statistics of the @xmath26h / h determinations in the high - z damped ly-@xmath33 absorbtion systems .      in summary , we presented some highlights on a new method of data regression and a reanalysis and update of the bbn nuclear network .",
    "some differences with the results currently quoted in the literature were discussed , but typically a reassuring agreement with the usual results has been found , confirming the robustness of the bbn predictions ."
