    "no experimental deviations from newtonian gravity are observed at distances above 0.2 mm @xcite , the extra dimensions must be at the sub - millimeter level with @xmath4 as low as few tev and @xmath11 .",
    "the right handed neutrino can be interpreted as a singlet with no quantum numbers to constrain it to the sm brane and thus , it can propagate into the extra dimensions just like gravity  @xcite .",
    "such singlet states in the bulk couple to the sm states on the brane as right handed neutrinos with small couplings  the yukawa couplings of the bulk fields are suppressed by the volume of the extra dimensions .",
    "the interactions between the bulk neutrino and the wall fields generate dirac mass terms between the wall fields and all the kaluza - klein modes of the bulk neutrino .",
    "as long as this mass is less than @xmath12 , the kaluza - klein modes are unaffected while for the zero mode , the interaction generates a dirac neutrino mass suppressed by the size of the extra dimensions : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath15 the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath16  gev .",
    "the mixing between the lightest neutrino with mass @xmath17 and the heavier neutrinos introduces a correction @xmath18 to the dirac mass such that the physical neutrino mass @xmath19 is  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 is a vector with @xmath2 integer components counting the number of states and the summation is taken over the kaluza - klein states up the fundamental scale @xmath4 .",

    "the framework of singlet neutrino in large extra dimensions must satisfy some phenomenological constraints : for @xmath29 , the mixing between the lightest state and the higher kaluza - klein excitations can be of @xmath30 and therefore problematic since in such a case @xmath31 is no longer valid .",

    "the spectrum of many extensions of the sm includes a charged higgs state .",
