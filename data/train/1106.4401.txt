    "the classical one - component plasma ( ocp ) is a standard model in the study of strongly coupled plasmas , playing a conceptual role similar to that of the hard - sphere model in the theory of simple liquids .",
    "it is often used as a model of matter under extreme conditions , e.g. compact astrophysical objects .",
    "the ocp consists of a system of identical point charges @xmath1 with mass @xmath2 , interacting through the coulomb potential , and immersed in a uniform background of opposite charge . in equilibrium",
    ", the system is characterised by the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mean interparticle distance with @xmath5 the particle density and @xmath6 the temperature .    as @xmath7 increases , the ocp changes from a nearly collisionless , gaseous regime for @xmath8 through an increasingly correlated , dense fluid regime in which the system shares certain properties with ordinary liquids .",
    "in particular , for @xmath9 it has been found that the transport coefficients ( diffusion , viscosity ) of the ocp obey universal laws satisfied by dense ordinary liquids @xcite .",
    "other features of the ocp dynamics are not shared by ordinary liquids .",
    "most notably , because of the long range coulomb interactions , the system exhibits the characteristic behavior of plasmas : density imbalances lead to high frequency plasma oscillations , rather than low frequency sound waves .",
    "these high frequency plasma oscillations , not encountered in ordinary liquids , led baus and hansen to question the validity of the hydrodynamic limit of the ocp @xcite . in fact , it was recently shown that the hydrodynamic limit of the ocp is not applicable , even at large @xmath7 values where high collisionality due to caging leads to liquidlike properties @xcite .",
    "it is the fact that the ocp shares some , but not all , properties with ordinary liquids that makes it a challenging yet fascinating system to study .    in this paper",
    "we will explore the complementarity of the liquid and plasma descriptions of the ocp by studying the wavevector and frequency dependent dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) , @xmath10 .",
    "the dsf contains complete information of the system dynamics at and near thermal equilibrium and is an important quantity because of its connection to inelastic light and neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "two main approaches have been proposed for modeling the dsf in the fluid regime @xmath11 : the memory function approach and the dynamic local field correction ( lfc ) approach . largely due to the lack of ` exact ' results ( from numerical simulations ) to compare to theoretical models of the memory function and lfc ,",
    "it is not clear which of these approaches is more suitable for providing a description that is simple and effective for a wide range of conditions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify this problem .",
    "the memory function approach - widely used for normal liquids - represents a generalized hydrodynamics in which both equilibrium properties and transport coefficients that appear in the conventional hydrodynamic ( navier - stokes ) description are replaced by suitably defined wavevector and frequency dependent quantities . in this approach ,",
    "the dsf is written in the form @xcite",

    "the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the real and imaginary parts of the laplace transform of the memory function @xmath17 . in order to fully specify the dsf a model for the memory function is required .",
    "of particular note is the gaussian memory function model first applied to the ocp by hansen et al .",
    "@xcite , which looked promising at the time of their study .",
    "the dynamics of the ocp can instead can be described in terms of the so - called dynamic local field correction ( lfc ) , @xmath18 .",
    "this approach is more common to coulomb systems e.g. the quantum electron gas @xcite .",

    "[ dynamiclfc ] .",
    "while the memory function is designed to extend the conventional hydrodynamic equations to finite wavevectors , the lfc is designed to correct the deficiencies of the mean field approximation ( i.e. the vlasov equation for the single particle distribution function , which describes the plasma oscillations but neglects any non - ideal or ` collisional ' effects ) . that is",
    ", setting @xmath23 gives the mean field approximation for the density response function ; this gives a good description of the ocp dynamics in the weak coupling regime , @xmath8 , only . a non - zero @xmath18 represents correlation effects beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "models for the lfc have been proposed by tanaka and ichimaru @xcite and by hong and kim @xcite , but these models have barely been tested other than for a very few conditions in the original studies ( and even for these conditions it was not clear how well the models agreed with the md data ) .    since the density response function and dsf are related through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath24 the lfc @xmath18 is clearly related to the memory function @xmath25 , albeit in a non - trivial way . in this paper",
    "we show that the memory function is a simpler quantity to model than the lfc .",
    "that is , a basic model for the memory function can describe both mean field and collisional effects that are characteristic of the dsf of the ocp , wheras an lfc that achieves this is much more complicated .",
    "specifically , as shown in sec .",
    "[ memoryfunction ] , the gaussian memory function model initially proposed by hansen et al . reproduces the md data for the dsf to remarkable accuracy across the entire fluid regime , and for all wavevectors @xmath26 .",

    "[ dynamiclfc ] , the lfc has a more complex structure - for this reason it is not well described by the models mentioned previously .",

    "the memory function model first applied to the ocp by hansen et al .",

    "the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath57 that appear in the model can be obtained by computing @xmath13 ( or equivalently @xmath52 ) with md and using the formulae given in the appendix for the frequency moments .",
    "the model then reduces to the determination of a single @xmath26 dependent parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the approach taken by hansen et al .",
    "was to treat @xmath53 as a parameter to be fitted to the md spectrum of @xmath10 .",

    "when we do this , we find in general that the model matches the md data remarkably well for all @xmath7 and @xmath26 values ( see fig .",
    "[ 1param ] ) . in some cases",
    ", however , there are small discrepancies between the model and md data , despite the fact that the model recreates the shape of the md data very well ( see fig .",
    "[ 1param2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to determine whether these discrepancies are due to deficiencies in the model or inaccuracies in the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath59 when computed with md , we have separately fitted the model to the md spectrum using all three parameters @xmath41 , @xmath59 and @xmath53 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1param2 ] , this three parameter fit is an even better match to the md data .",
    "since the values of the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath59 from the three parameter fit agree very closely ( within @xmath60 ) with those computed with md , we conclude that the improvement in the agreement between the model when all three parameters are fitted versus when only one is fitted is due to small inaccuracies when @xmath41 and @xmath57 are taken from the md @xmath52 and @xmath13 ; the model is rather sensitive to the precise values of the frequency moments .",
    "that is , the one parameter fits are irrelevant as their comparison with the md data is not indicative of the quality of the model . in figs .",

    "the small high frequency peak for @xmath67 is of particular interest - it does not appear to have been seen or commented upon in previous md calculations .",
    "we believe that this peak is due to microscopic ` caging ' effects .",
    "that is , at these lengthscales , the relatively high frequency oscillations of individual particles in the cages produced by their neighbors are imprinted on @xmath10 .",
    "this deduction is supported by previous work showing that for @xmath68 , a high frequency peak appears in the velocity autocorrelation function at @xmath69 @xcite ; this is exactly the position of the additional peak in @xmath10 .",
    "we note that although the model does not fully capture the additional structure in the md data for these conditions , on average it does give a good account of the overall shape of the spectrum .",

    "thus , in order to describe well the dynamics of the ocp for @xmath84 , it is necessary to take collisions into account by having a frequency dependent dynamic local field correction .    for the classical one - component plasma , two main formulations of the frequency dependent local field correction have been given .",
