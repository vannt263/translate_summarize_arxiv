    "the hurwitz zeta function defined by the series @xmath0 where @xmath1 , is a well - defined series when @xmath2 , and can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane with one singularity , a simple pole with residue @xmath3 at @xmath4 .",
    "the hurwitz zeta function has also the following integral representation    @xmath5    valid for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has the following analytic continuation represented by the following contour integral @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the hankel contour consisting of the three parts @xmath8 : a path which extends from @xmath9 , around the origin counter clockwise on a circle of center the origin and of radius @xmath10 and back to @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is an arbitrarily small positive number .",
    "the integral ( [ sec1-eq3 ] ) defines @xmath12 for all @xmath13 with a single pole at @xmath4 .",
    "the new representations of @xmath12 are based on the alternating sums defined by    @xmath14    and by @xmath15 for @xmath16 , and on the real function @xmath17 defined by    @xmath18    we prove the following theorem    [ sec2-thm1 ] for all @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and all @xmath21 , we have    @xmath22    we can rewrite @xmath23 in ( [ sec2-eq1 ] ) as    @xmath24    since we know that    @xmath25    a valid formula for @xmath26 , and since    @xmath27    the proof consists of an evaluation of the sum    @xmath28    but before we do so , we need to establish the following two identities valid for @xmath29 :    @xmath30    to prove these identities , we start from the series    @xmath31    which is valid for @xmath29 .",
    "this yields    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    from which the two identities follow easily .    without worrying about interchanging sums and integrals for the moment",
    ", we have    @xmath34    and similarly    @xmath35    therefore ,    @xmath36    this proves that the right hand sides of ( a ) and ( b ) in the statement of the theorem are equal .",
    "now , by observing that @xmath37    we can perform an integration by parts in ( [ sec2-eq16 ] ) when @xmath2 .",
    "the integral in the right hand side of ( [ sec2-eq16 ] ) becomes    @xmath38    thus ,    @xmath39    and this prove the theorem when @xmath2 .",
    "however , formula ( [ sec2-eq19 ] ) remains valid for @xmath20 since the integral ( [ sec2-eq16 ] ) is well - defined for @xmath20 .",
    "to finish the proof , we now need to justify the interchange of summation and integration in both equation ( [ sec2-eq11 ] ) and equation ( [ sec2-eq14 ] ) .",
    "we show this justification for equation ( [ sec2-eq11 ] ) only , the other is similar .",
    "the interchange in ( [ sec2-eq11 ] ) is indeed valid because the series @xmath40    converges absolutely and uniformly for @xmath29 . to prove this",
    ", it suffices to show uniform convergence for the dominating series @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath43 , @xmath29 .",
    "a straightforward calculation of the derivative shows that @xmath44 and is attained when @xmath45 .",
    "now , for @xmath46 , we have @xmath47    the last inequality implies that each term of the dominating series is bounded by @xmath48 .",
    "thus the dominating series converges by the comparison test .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .    with @xmath7 being the hankel contour defined previously ,",
    "an immediate corollary of theorem  [ sec2-thm1 ] is the following    [ sec2-coro1 ] for @xmath21 and for all @xmath49 , we have    @xmath50    the proof the first statement follows the same steps as in @xcite for example . as for the second statement",
    ", we can either proceed as in @xcite or as in @xcite denotes the hurwitz zeta function , @xmath51 in the cited paper is a power series associated with @xmath52 and has nothing to do with the hurwitz zeta function . ] . in @xcite ,",
    "the proof was given for @xmath52 ( i.e. @xmath53 ) and uses an estimate of the exact asymptotic order of growth of @xmath54 when @xmath55 is large . by looking at the definition of @xmath23",
    ", we can see that @xmath54 are the stirling numbers of the second kind modulo a multiplicative factor when @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath57 , @xmath58 a positive integer , @xmath59 are eventually zero for @xmath55 large enough .",
    "similarly , @xmath23 are the generalized stirling numbers of the second kind whose generating function is given by @xcite :    @xmath60    it follows that    @xmath61    and hence @xmath62 are eventually zero for @xmath55 large enough .    for @xmath63 , an asymptotic estimate of @xmath23",
    "can be obtained for @xmath55 large .",
    "indeed , we have by definition    @xmath64    by making the change of variable , @xmath65 , the sum can obviously be put into the form    @xmath66    asymptotic expansions of sums of the form ( [ sec2-eq25 ] ) have been thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath67 has a non - integral algebraic singularity at @xmath68 since @xmath69 ; thus , when @xmath19 is nonintegral , @xmath23 has the following asymptotics when @xmath55 is large    @xmath70    and when @xmath71 the following expansion    @xmath72    for the case @xmath53 and @xmath19 nonintegral , the numerator becomes equal to 1 and we obtain    @xmath73    the asymptotic estimates ( [ sec2-eq26 ] ) , ( [ sec2-eq26bis ] ) and ( [ sec2-eq27 ] ) are valid for @xmath55 large enough and for all @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "to finish the proof of the corollary , we note that the logarithmic test of series implies that our series is dominated by a uniformly convergent series for all finite @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "now , by weierstrass theorem of the uniqueness of analytic continuation , the function @xmath74 can be extended outside of the domain @xmath2 and that it does not have any singularity when @xmath20 . moreover , by repeating the same process for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , it is clear that the series defines an analytic continuation of @xmath52 valid for all @xmath13 .",
    "we can also obtain the analytic continuation of @xmath12 to the whole complex plane via the following    [ sec2-coro2 ] for all @xmath19 such that @xmath75 and all @xmath21 , we have @xmath77    for all @xmath58 and all @xmath21 , the integrand is bounded and has finite values at the limits of integration .",
    "repeated integration by parts proves the corollary .",
    "now if we consider the function @xmath78 dealt with in @xcite , we obtain the following corollary    [ sec2-coro3 ] let @xmath79 .",
    "then , for all @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and all @xmath80 , we have    @xmath81    the proof follows the same lines as the proof of theorem  [ sec2-thm1 ] .",
    "we note that when @xmath82 , @xmath83",
    ". the formulas of corollary  [ sec2-coro3 ] reduce to the formulas found in @xcite .",
    "berndt @xcite ( see also the references therein ) derived expressions for the coefficients of the laurent expansion of the hurwitz zeta - function @xmath12 about @xmath4 .",
    "he also provided a method to calculate and estimate these coefficients . in this section ,",
    "we give exact estimates of the coefficients of @xmath84 for any point of the complex plane , and from these coefficients the laurent coefficients of @xmath12 about the same point can be easily calculated .",
    "the idea is to simply use the integral formula given in formula ( a ) of theorem  [ sec2-thm1 ] . from this formula",
    ", the analytic function @xmath87 can be represented by a taylor series around any point @xmath88                          to get the last formula , we have merely used the coefficient formula of division of power series .",
    "the formula is recursive and can be used to calculate @xmath101 for any @xmath1 and any @xmath88 in the right half plane .",
    "if @xmath88 is not in the right half plane , the integral formula ( [ sec2-eq28 ] ) of corollary  [ sec2-coro2 ] can be used instead ."
