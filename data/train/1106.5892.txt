    "amorphous optical media such as the amorphous silicon are used extensively as waveguides in optoelectronic devices @xcite . because of the strong light confinement and the sub - wavelength core size of these waveguides , light propagates paraxially along their axis .",
    "normally defects are present in the medium , which affect its optical properties due to the elasto - optic strain .",
    "the study of paraxial propagation in defected amorphous media is , thus , important .",
    "recently , we have examined paraxial propagation in screw dislocated amorphous media @xcite . while dislocations are translational defects , rotational defects ( disclinations ) are also common in disordered media such as amorphous solids and liquid crystals . in the present work ,",
    "we study paraxial beam propagation along the wedge axis of a disclinated amorphous medium .",
    "the presence of wedge disclination in an initially homogeneous isotropic amorphous medium is shown to induce weak inhomogeneity as well as _ uniaxial _",
    "anisotropy due to the elsto - optic effect .",
    "the inhomogeneity causes an adiabatic variation in the direction of the wave propagation , resulting in berry phase and curvature that are affected by the uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the geometric berry phase @xcite acquired by an optical beam ( as the pancharatnam phase @xcite or a spin redirection phase @xcite ) has attracted extensive attention .",
    "in particular , observable effects such as the rytov - vladimirskii rotation @xcite and the optical spin hall ( or magnus ) effect @xcite have been derived as manifestations of berry phase and curvature , respectively @xcite . here",
    ", the berry phase manifests itself as a precession of the polarization vector , which is characteristic of anisotropic media @xcite .",
    "the berry curvature enters the equations of motion of the beam and is responsible for the opposite deflections of the right / left circularly polarized beams . because of the anisotropy , these deflections vary sinusoidally along the paraxial direction .",
    "this yields the optical spin hall effect in the disclinated medium , whose application in determining the birefringence and the magnitude of the frank vector is explained .",
    "we consider a monochromatic circularly polarized wave propagating paraxially in a homogeneous isotropic medium of refractive index @xmath0 .",
    "the unit wave vector @xmath1 thus holds an angle @xmath2 , which is always sufficiently small , with the paraxial direction @xmath3 . denoting the polarization vectors by @xmath4 ,",
    "where @xmath5 correspond to right / left circular polarization ( @xmath6 ) , we have @xmath7 @xmath8 being the spherical unit vectors orthogonal to @xmath1 .",
    "the beam s spin angular momentum along the direction of propagation ( the helicity ) is @xcite @xmath9    we consider the effect of introducing a wedge disclination , with frank vector @xmath10 oriented along the paraxial direction , in the initially homogeneous isotropic medium . from the standpoint of a volterra process",
    ", the wedge disclination corresponds to cutting or inserting a material wedge of dihedral angle @xmath11 , which is generally small .",
    "the corresponding displacement vector field , @xmath12 , in cylindrical coordinates has the nonzero component @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and the @xmath15(@xmath16 ) sign pertains to insertion ( cut ) .",
    "since @xmath17 is small , the disclination produces slight expansion / compression and renders the medium weakly inhomogeneous .",
    "this will cause an adiabatic variation in the direction of the wave propagation resulting in berry phase and curvature .",
    "furthermore , the disclination strain tensor field has the following nonzero components : @xmath18 the relative permittivity tensor @xmath19 , thus , acquires an anisotropic part @xmath20 due to the strain , where ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath21 @xmath22 being the elasto - optic coefficients of the medium .",
    "a wedge disclination , therefore , renders an otherwise homogeneous isotropic medium weakly inhomogeneous and anisotropic . for amorphous media , where only two independent elasto - optic coefficients ( customarily denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) exist ,",
    "we find , after detailed calculations , @xmath25 other components being zero .",
    "the principle refractive indices are , therefore , @xmath26 to first order in the elasto - optic perturbation .",
    "( the adiabatic variation of refractive indices with position are to be ignored , of course . )",
    "the weak _ uniaxial _ anisotropy thus induced in the amorphous medium results in a phase difference for the two linearly polarized modes that constitute the paraxial beam .",
    "therefore , the polarization vector becomes @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the wave number in vacuum and @xmath29 is the induced birefringence .",
    "note that @xmath4 still satisfy the orthonormality condition @xmath6 , of course .",
    "the beam s helicity is calculated from ( [ hel ] ) to be @xmath30 . as expected @xcite ,",
    "the helicity varies along the paraxial direction due to the induced elasto - optic birefringence and reduces to the constant value @xmath31 in the absence of the wedge disclination ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the adiabatic variation of the refractive indices with position has negligible dynamical effect and was , therefore , ignored",
    ". however , the resulting adiabatic variation of the beam direction @xmath1 plays a geometric role with nontrivial consequences for the beam dynamics . as usual , the variation gives rise to a parallel transport law in the momentum space , defined by the berry connection ( gauge potential ) @xmath33 using ( [ e ] ) , we obtain @xmath34 or in matrix notation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pauli matrix vector and @xmath37 equation ( [ m ] ) describes the parallel transport of the polarization vector along the beam and generalizes a previous result for inhomogeneous isotropic media @xcite .",
    "the berry curvature ( gauge field strength ) associated with this connection is ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39    in the course of propagation , the polarization evolves according to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the geometric berry phase . here",
    "@xmath42 is the beam trajectory in momentum space and @xmath43 is the berry phase accumulated for @xmath44 in the absence of anisotropy .",
    "( in the absence of anisotropy , ( [ ph ] ) simply yields the phase factor @xmath45 that leads to the well known rytov rotation . )",
    "the evolution , thus , entails a precession of the polarization vector , which is characteristic of anisotropic media @xcite , about the unit vector @xmath46 . in view of the polarization evolution ,",
    "the berry curvature for a given beam is , therefore , @xmath47 where the last expression follows because @xmath48 and @xmath49 commute .",
    "hence @xmath50 which reduces to the well known result in the absence of anisotropy , namely , the field of a magnetic monopole of charge @xmath31 situated at the origin of the momentum space @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of the beam in the presence of momentum space berry curvature have been derived repeatedly for various particle beams ( photons @xcite , phonons @xcite and electrons @xcite ) .",
    "the beam trajectory , @xmath51 , satisfies @xmath52 where dot denotes derivative with respect to the beam length .",
    "this differs from the standard ray equation of the geometrical optics , which holds in the absence of disclination , by the term involving the berry curvature .",
    "it yields the beam deflection @xmath53 which results in the splitting of beams of opposite polarizations and , being orthogonal to the beam direction , produces a spin current across the direction of propagation .",
    "this is the optical spin hall effect in the disclinated medium and generalizes a previous result for inhomogeneous isotropic media @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 varies sinusoidally along the paraxial direction with wavelength @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the beam s wavelength in vacuum ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , it vanishes for successive beam points that are separated by @xmath57 along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "measurement of this determines the birefringence and provides an indirect method for determining the magnitude of the frank vector , @xmath58 , through ( [ biref ] ) .",
