    "the coupling of the light vector mesons to the tensor current @xmath5 has driven a lot of attention in the last years , the reason being the crucial role that this coupling plays in the determination of the @xmath6 ckm parameter from exclusive semileptonic and radiative decays of the @xmath7-meson within light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr )  @xcite .    however , while the vector form factor can be extracted from experiments on @xmath8 annihilation or hadronic @xmath9 decays , the tensor form factor can only be obtained theoretically .",
    "since form factors are purely non - perturbative quantities , lattice gauge theory and effective field theories are in this case the appropriate tools .    on the effective field theory side ,",
    "it is worth mentioning some attempts to estimate the value of @xmath10 in the chiral limit . within the context of resonance chiral theory , in the strict large-@xmath11 limit and under the minimal hadronic ansatz approximation ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , the value of @xmath14 .",
    "their result is compatible with the independent determination of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which lcsr were used . in ref .",
    "@xcite we derived a theorem valid at leading order in @xmath15 and @xmath16 in which , for highly excited vector mesons , the ratio @xmath17 tends to @xmath18 in absolute value .",
    "this value is surprisingly close to the lattice result for the @xmath0 meson @xcite , and seems to hint at some sort of universality for the ratio @xmath19 .    on the lattice side ,",
    "it was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the light - cone sum rules in @xmath20 are particularly sensitive to @xmath14 and therefore an effort from the lattice community to reduce its uncertainty was well motivated . since then",
    ", many lattice collaborations have devoted studies to @xmath5 using different techniques and approximations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , with overall agreement .",
    "one of the main sources of uncertainty in the previous lattice simulations is the extrapolation from the quark masses used in the simulations to the actual physical ones .",
    "the appropriate theoretical framework to perform such extrapolations is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath21pt ) .",
    "formulas for the decay couplings of pseudo - goldstone bosons ( using @xmath21pt ) and b mesons ( combining @xmath21pt and hqet ) exist . for light vector mesons",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated : vector masses are not protected by chiral symmetry and their couplings to pseudo - goldstone bosons spoil the power - counting of the theory .",
    "the power - counting can however be preserved if a heavy meson mass expansion is performed .",
    "this last approach , normally referred to as heavy meson effective theory ( hmet ) was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the chiral corrections to the vector meson mass spectrum .",
    "the formalism was later extended to include external vector sources and used to evaluate the chiral corrections to @xmath22 . in this letter",
    "we will generalize the theory to account for external tensor couplings in order to compute the chiral corrections to @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we will compute the leading chiral logarithms directly to the ratio @xmath19 .",
    "this will prove to be extremely convenient for several reasons :",
    "( i ) all contributions to the wave function renormalization and mass corrections can be ignored , since they identically cancel in the ratio ; ( ii ) we can make direct comparison with the lattice results , since this is precisely the quantity determined by the lattice groups ; ( iii ) in lattice simulations , systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratio . in our effective theory approach , this translates into a reduction of the unknown low energy couplings that enter the calculation , thus enhancing the predictive power of our results .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section  [ theoreticalframework ] we discuss the introduction of external tensor sources in hmet and write down the lagrangian relevant for the computation of the chiral corrections @xmath19 at leading order . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present our results for two- and three - flavour hmet , while in section  [ newtheories ] we discuss the case of @xmath3 hmet , relevant when the strange quark is considered as heavy , by building effective field theories for the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 .",
    "we finally present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in order to compute the chiral corrections to vector meson decay couplings we need an effective field theory describing the interactions of vector mesons with low - momentum ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath23 ) goldstone bosons .",
    "a generic problem with such theories is that vector masses do not vanish in the chiral limit and therefore derivatives on the vector fields are not soft and spoil the chiral power - counting .",
    "since @xmath24 , a possible solution is to split the vector momentum into a hard part and a residual one , @xmath25 , and perform a heavy mass expansion .",
    "such an approach was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite under the name of hmet .",
    "the theory has been used in the past to compute corrections to the vector meson masses  @xcite and vector decay couplings  @xcite . here",
    "we will extend the formalism to include the couplings to tensor sources .",
    "vector fields in hmet are constructed from the fully relativitic ones by factoring out the hard momentum shells @xmath26+{\\hat{s}}_{\\mu}^{(v)\\,||}\\,,\\label{eq : heavy - limit}\\ ] ] such that the effective fields @xmath27 , which satisfy @xmath28 , only depend on the residual momentum @xmath29 . in the previous equation",
    ", @xmath30 stands for the mass of the vector mesons in the chiral limit . since @xmath31 , the chiral power - counting",
    "is clearly preserved .",
    "it is worth noting that the field @xmath27 only contains the annihilation mode , and correspondingly @xmath32 only the creation mode .",
    "can be shown to be a hard mode and therefore can be integrated out in the effective action . ] in the following we will drop the velocity label and refer to the vector fields simply as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in the framework of @xmath35 @xmath21pt the vector fields @xmath33",
    "transform as , such that under transformatios of the unbroken @xmath36 group they behave as the adjoint representation . in our analysis",
    "we will assume ideal mixing , such that the @xmath2 is a pure @xmath37 state , while the @xmath38 and the @xmath39 are orthogonal combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 quarks . under this assumption",
    "the octet and singlet vector fields can be joined as a nonet @xmath42 \\rho^{- } & \\frac{\\omega-\\rho^{0}}{\\sqrt{2 } } & k^{*0}\\\\[3.5ex ] k^{*- } & \\bar{k}^{*0 } & \\phi\\end{array}\\right]_{\\mu}.\\ ] ]    as usual , goldstone modes will be collected in a special unitary matrix @xmath40 transforming as , @xmath43 \\pi^- & { { -\\,\\dfrac{\\pi^0}{\\sqrt{2}}}+{\\dfrac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{6 } } } } & k^{0}\\\\[3.5ex ] k^{- } & { \\bar{k}}^{0 } & -\\,{2\\,\\dfrac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{6 } } } \\end{array}\\right]\\,.\\ ] ]    hmet can be extended to account for the interactions with arbitrary external sources .",
    "the theory was initially purported to describe interactions of vector mesons with soft pions and photons @xcite . however , to describe a form factor we need an external source carrying enough momenta to create a heavy resonance . in ref .",
    "@xcite the theory was adapted to account for hard photons .",
    "the method can be easily extended to generic spin - one sources ( _ i.e. _ vector , axial - vector , and tensor ) .",
    "let @xmath44 be a generic spin - one external source , and let us decompose it , by analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : heavy - limit ] ) , into hard and soft components @xmath45 where @xmath46 creates a vector meson , @xmath47 annihilates it , and @xmath48 is a soft interaction .",
    "one then has the conventional ( soft ) chiral transformations , but also hard transformations , with support over hard momentum shells .",
    "chiral ward identities are satisfied if under a chiral transformation @xmath49 , @xmath50 transform locally and @xmath51 , @xmath52 globally , whereas under a hard transformation , @xmath49 , @xmath50 stay invariant and @xmath51 , @xmath52 transform locally ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    for tensor sources , a decomposition like eq .",
    "( [ generic ] ) also follows , but chiral invariance requires the presence of two fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 , transforming as @xmath55 which are chiral projections of the tensor source @xmath56 wherept in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer the reader there for all the details concerning how to decompose the tensor source in irreducible chiral operators . ]",
    "@xmath57    since there are no ward identities associated to the tensor current , under a hard transformation @xmath58 stays invariant and @xmath59 transforms globally , while they both transform globally under a chiral transformation .    in order to build the lagrangian , it is convenient to work in the following basis : @xmath60\\,,\\\\ \\chi_{\\pm}&=&u^{\\dagger } \\chi\\ , u^{\\dagger}\\pm u\\ , \\chi^{\\dagger } u\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with the following external sources for vector and tensor sources : @xmath61 such that all elements transform under the chiral group as @xmath62 . for our purposes",
    ", @xmath21 will only play the role of a mass insertion operator , and therefore @xmath63 .",
    "since we have explicitly split vector fields and external sources into positive and negative frequency modes , in hmet the cpt theorem is not automatically satisfied , and we will require our effective lagrangian to be separately invariant under c , p and t. in particular t invariance will be essential to ensure reality of the low energy parameters of the theory  @xcite . in table  [ tab : transformation ] we display the transformation properties of all our building blocks under discrete symmetries . as usual , we promote the derivatives to covariant derivatives @xmath64 such that @xmath65 transforms in the same way as @xmath66 ( the definitions can be found , _",

    "( [ results3 ] ) , favouring the absence of chiral logarithms in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "we have performed two different fits on the lattice data , one with a quadratic and cubic dependence on the pion mass ( the cubic fit ) , and one with a quadratic and chiral logarithmic dependence ( the logarithmic fit ) , and compared them with the quadratic and quartic fits of ref .",
    "the results for the various fits are collected in table  2 , where for comparison we have also included the value of the chirally - extrapolated ratios @xmath19 .",
    "two comments are in order at this point : ( i ) in performing this exercise we are implicitly assuming that the qualitative behaviour of @xmath19 as a function of the quark masses is rather insensitive to the lattice spacing , such that eq .",
    "( [ results3 ] ) can be used .",
    "this assumption is however not so implausible : similar exercises in the light pseudoscalar sector seem to indicate that , even away from the continuum limit , chiral logarithms are correctly reproduced ; ( ii ) we should emphasize that the chirally - extrapolated values for the ratios listed in table  2 should not be taken as actual values for @xmath19 .",
    "rather , they should be considered only as an indication of how the different fits would affect the predictions for @xmath19 : as already noted above , the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are not in the continuum limit .    based on the @xmath67/dof for the different fits , the results of our analysis show that @xmath2 data seem to prefer the quadratic behaviour over the logarithmic one . in contrast , for the @xmath0 data the best fit is the logarithmic one , although only in a marginal way .",
    "data seems to describe the characteristic bending of a logarithmic behaviour , but the statistical errors are still too big to be conclusive .",
    "therefore , in the absence of better statistics no firm conclusions can be drawn at this point .",
    "the situation for the @xmath1 meson is less clear , but preliminary data from etmc at three different lattice spacings seem to strongly prefer the quadratic fit over the logarithmic one .",
    "therefore , lattice data , at least at a qualitative level , seems to agree remarkably well with the predictions coming from chiral symmetry .    .",
