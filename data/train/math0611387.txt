    "any collection of @xmath1 hyperplanes in @xmath0 determine a partition of this euclidean space ( and any mass distribution in it ) into @xmath2 hyperorthants ( defined as the intersections of the appropriate half - spaces ) .",
    "given a family of @xmath3 mass distributions in @xmath0 , we say that a collection of @xmath1 hyperplanes forms a equipartition of these @xmath3 mass distributions if each hyperorthant contains exactly @xmath4 of each of the given mass distributions .",
    "the question when every family of @xmath3 mass distributions in @xmath0 admit an equipartition by some collection of @xmath1 hyperplanes , is known as the equipartition problem , and it was formulated by b. gr \" unbaum in 1960 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it attracted a lot of attention and some answers to this problem are already obtained in @xcite .",
    "very thorough treatment of this question is presented in @xcite , where more complete results are obtained .",
    "however , the question remains unsettled in general , and is still considered as an important and difficult question in the area of discrete and computational geometry / topology .",
    "the most recent and the most complete answers to this question are given in @xcite .",
    "the most important open question is whether every mass distribution in @xmath5 admits an equipartition by @xmath6 hyperplanes in @xmath7 hyperorthants .    in this paper",
    "we treat the related problem of equipartition of a mass distribution by a family of hyperplanes in a special position , namely by a collection of parallel hyperplanes and one or more additional non - parallel hyperplanes .",
    "since such a collection of hyperplanes divides @xmath0 in the box - like regions ( or boxes ) , we will refer to this question as to the question of equipartition of a mass distribution in boxes .",
    "we obtain the general sufficient condition on the dimension @xmath8 and the number of parallel hyperplanes so that every mass distribution in @xmath0 admits such equipartition .",
    "( see theorems [ 2 ] , [ three ] , [ threeo ] , [ gen ] and [ geno ] . ) as the sample results illustrating the obtained results we mention here the following three ( see corollary [ two ] , corollary [ trio ] and corollary [ tri ] ) .",
    "* claim 1 . *",
    "every mass distribution in the plane admits an equipartition in @xmath9 boxes by two parallel lines and one additional line not parallel to them .",
    "* claim 2 . * any mass distribution in @xmath5 could be equipartitioned in @xmath10 boxes by a collection of @xmath6 hyperplanes two of which are parallel .",
    "* claim 3 . * any mass distribution in @xmath11 could be equipartitioned in @xmath12 boxes by a collection of @xmath9 parallel hyperplanes and two additional non - parallel hyperplanes .",
    "notice that the claim 2 is related to the ( above mentioned ) most important open case of the original question of b. gr \" unbaum .",
    "we do nt know whether for every mass distribution in @xmath5 , there exists a @xmath6-tuple of hyperplanes equipartitioning this mass distribution in @xmath7 hyperorthants .",
    "but , if we consider @xmath6-tuples of hyperplanes two of which are parallel , they divide the space and the mass distribution in @xmath13 boxes , and claim 2 shows that we could always find such a @xmath6-tuple equipartitioning the measure .    for technical reasons ,",
    "we treat separately the cases of even and odd number of parallel hyperplanes .",
    "we first discuss the case of even number of parallel hyperplanes , and then explain the differences in the formulation and the proof of the odd case .    throughout this paper , we work with the continuous mass distributions with the positive measure of any open set in @xmath0 .",
    "( a continuous mass distribution is a finite borel measure @xmath14 defined by the formula @xmath15 for an integrable density function @xmath16 . ) because of that , the hyperplane orthogonal to some direction and partitioning the given mass distribution in the given ratio is unique . using the limit argument , it is easy to extend the result to all mass distributions which are weak limits of the mass distributions satisfying the above properties . in particular , the results are true for measurable sets and for finitely supported measures .",
    "we use the topological method in treating this question .",
    "more precisely , we reduce the above question to the question of the existence of an equivariant map . there is a number of ways to treat the latter question , such as the use of characteristic classes or the use of the obstruction theory . we find it most convenient to use the index theory approach as formulated by e. fadell and s. husseini in @xcite .",
    "the application of topological methods in combinatorics dates back ( at least ) to 70 s and the papers by l. lov ' asz , i. b ' ar ' any and others .",
    "the appearance of these ideas and their development served as the starting point in the creation of the new subfield , topological combinatorics .",
    "for the reader s convenience , we present a very short review of the ideal - valued cohomological index theory by e. fadell and s. husseini . given a finite group @xmath17 , and a @xmath17-map @xmath18 between @xmath17-spaces @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we could map these spaces to the one - point space @xmath21 and obtain a commutative diagram of @xmath17-spaces and @xmath17-maps . multiplying by the total space @xmath22 of the universal @xmath17-bundle @xmath23 , we obtain new commutative diagram of @xmath17-spaces and @xmath17-maps .",
    "( we consider the diagonal @xmath17-action on the product spaces . )",
    "passing to the spaces of orbits , we obtain the following commutative diagram of continuous maps :    1.00 mm    ( 92,34 )    which induces the following commutative diagram in cohomology :    1.00 mm    ( 98,38 )    the kernels of the maps @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the ideals in the cohomology ring of the classifying space of the group @xmath17 , and they are called indices and denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .    the commutativity of the above diagram implies the relation @xmath28 . if we could prove that this inclusion relation is not satisfied , we would obtain a contradiction proving that a @xmath17-equivariant map @xmath29 does not exist .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper @xcite for additional properties of the index and some basic computation",
    ". some other computations , needed in this paper could be found in @xcite , corollary 2.12 and proposition 2.7 .",
    "in order to describe the method and develop the intuition in a more acceptable way , we choose to treat the simplest particular case first .",
    "so , in this section we treat the question of equipartition of a mass distribution in @xmath0 by a collection of parallel hyperplanes and by one additional hyperplane ( not parallel to them ) .",
    "we show that the greatest number of parallel hyperplanes for which such an equipartition always exists ( for every mass distribution in @xmath0 ) is @xmath30",
    ". the same result will be true also for @xmath31 parallel hyperplanes in @xmath0 , but the equipartition with @xmath32 parallel hyperplanes are always possible only in @xmath33 .",
    "the obtained result is the best possible in the sense that for greater number of hyperplanes , the corresponding equivariant mapping exists .    [ 2 ] for every mass distribution in @xmath0 there is a collection of @xmath30 parallel hyperplanes and one additional hyperplane dividing @xmath0 in @xmath34 boxes containing the same amount of the mass distribution .    especially , when @xmath35 , we obtain the proof of the following corollary .",
    "[ two ] every mass distribution in the plane admits an equipartition in @xmath9 boxes by two parallel lines and one additional line not parallel to them.@xmath36    the proof of the theorem [ 2 ] ( with the complete description of the approach , needed also in the proofs of other results from this paper ) is contained in the following two subsections .      in this subsection",
    "we reduce the statement of the above theorem to the topological statement .    for any mass distribution in @xmath0 and any pair of vectors @xmath37 , let @xmath38 be the oriented hyperplanes orthogonal to @xmath39 , ordered in the direction of the vector @xmath39 , and dividing @xmath0 into @xmath32 regions each containing the same amount ( i.e. @xmath40 ) of the considered mass distribution .",
    "also , let @xmath41 be the oriented hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath42 dissecting a mass distribution into two halfspaces containing the same amount of the mass distribution .",
    "these hyperplanes form @xmath43 boxes and the measure of these boxes form a @xmath44 matrix of the form @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47    so , we could identify the configuration space of our problem to be the product of two spheres @xmath48 and the test space as the space of all @xmath44 matrices of the above form .",
    "the group @xmath49 acts naturally both on configuration space and the test space ( by the obvious permutations ) .",
    "the test space could also be seen as the @xmath50-dimensional linear representation of the group @xmath49 , which we denote by @xmath51 . the test map @xmath52 , which maps each pair of unit vectors to the measures of the corresponding boxes , is easily seen to be @xmath53-equivariant .",
    "now , our problem is reduced to the topological claim that the matrix @xmath54    ( obtained when @xmath55 ) belongs to the image of the test map @xmath56 .",
    "suppose , to the contrary , this not to be the case .",
    "then we would have a @xmath57-equivariant map @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the unit sphere of the representation space @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we reach a contradiction ( proving in this way our claim ) , by showing that such equivariant map with the actions of our group described formerly could not exist . in proving this",
    "we use the ideal valued cohomological index theory of fadell and husseini .",
    "we will use the approach described above to show that there is no @xmath57-equivariant map @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the unit sphere of the representation space @xmath51 described in the section [ red ] .",
    "so , we work with the group @xmath60 , and it is well known that @xmath61 , and @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the free generators of this polynomial ring in dimension @xmath65 both .",
    "the generators of the group @xmath60 act by the antipodal action on the corresponding spheres in @xmath48 .",
    "it is well known that in this case we have @xmath66 , i.e. the index is the ideal generated by the monomials @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "now we determine the index of the unit sphere in the representation space @xmath51 .",
    "we refer the reader to the survey article @xcite ( corollary 2.12 ) , for the necessary background for the following computation . as we noticed in the section [ red ]",
    ", @xmath51 is the @xmath50-dimensional representation which could be described as the space of all @xmath44 matrices of the form @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 the generator of the first copy of @xmath69 acts on such matrices by permuting the columns in the reverse order , i.e. by sending @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "the generator of the second copy of @xmath69 acts by permuting two rows , i.e. by sending each @xmath72 to @xmath73 . by the relation @xmath74 ,",
    "the element @xmath75 is determined by the remaining elements . to shorten the notation we will subtract @xmath76 from the entries of the above mentioned matrix , and present the matrix in the form",
    "@xmath77    so , @xmath51 is a @xmath50-dimensional representation of the group @xmath49 .",
    "the representation space @xmath51 splits in the sum of @xmath30 invariant @xmath65-dimensional representations .",
    "we present @xmath78 pairs of this @xmath17-invariant @xmath65-dimensional representations .",
    "the @xmath79-th pair of this representations form the matrices of the form : @xmath80    and the matrices of the form : @xmath81    here , we write only the entries in the @xmath79-th , @xmath8-th , and @xmath82-th column of the matrix , while all other entries are @xmath83 .",
    "the generator of the first copy of @xmath69 acts on such matrices by permuting the columns in the reverse order , and so it acts trivially on the first mentioned @xmath65-dimensional subspace of matrices and antipodally on the second .",
    "the generator of the second copy of @xmath69 acts by permuting two rows , and so it acts antipodally on both @xmath65 dimensional subspaces of matrices .",
    "so , the index @xmath84 is the ideal in the polynomial ring @xmath85 $ ] generated by the polynomial @xmath86 .",
    "( consult @xcite . )",
    "all the summands of the polynomial @xmath87    belong to the ideal @xmath88 , except for the first one @xmath89 .",
    "so , this polynomial is not contained in the ideal @xmath88 .",
    "this means that @xmath90 .",
    "the considerations from the previous subsection show that there is no @xmath53-equivariant mapping from @xmath48 to @xmath59 , which implies that every equivariant map from @xmath48 to the representation space @xmath51 maps some pair of unit vectors @xmath91 to the matrix @xmath54    this completes the argument and proves our theorem .",
    "if we consider the case of odd number of parallel hyperplanes ( @xmath32 of them ) , the similar considerations would prove the following theorem .    for every mass distribution in @xmath33",
    "there is a collection of @xmath32 parallel hyperplanes and one additional hyperplane dividing it in @xmath92 boxes containing the same amount of the mass distribution .",
    "the major difference is that we are now faced with two central columns , since the matrix has even number of columns ( @xmath93 of them ) , and in very similar way we get that the index of the sphere in the representation space is the ideal generated by the polynomial @xmath94 .",
    "this polynomial belongs to the ideal generated by monomials @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but does not belong to the ideal generated by monomials @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "notice that in the case @xmath97 the stronger result ( in some sense ) is obtained for even number of hyperplanes .",
    "namely , any mass distribution in @xmath33 could be equipartitioned also in @xmath98 boxes by some @xmath93 parallel hyperplanes and one additional non - parallel to them .",
    "in this section we generalize the result from the previous section to the case of equipartition of a mass distribution in some euclidean space @xmath0 by a collection of parallel hyperplanes orthogonal to the direction @xmath39 , and by two additional hyperplanes not parallel neither to the first mentioned collection nor one to each other .",
    "first we consider even number @xmath99 of parallel hyperplanes . in this case",
    "we treat the equipartition of a mass distribution in @xmath100 boxes .",
    "our aim is to determine the sufficient condition on the dimension @xmath8 and the number @xmath1 so that every mass distribution in @xmath0 admits such an equipartition .",
    "since we use the index theory again , we provide an algorithm to decide the above question for a pair of numbers @xmath8 and @xmath1 , which reduces the question to the question whether some polynomial belongs to some ideal in the polynomial algebra @xmath101 $ ] over @xmath102 variables .",
    "let us denote with @xmath103 the dickson polynomial in @xmath102 variables . over @xmath69 ,",
    "this dickson polynomial has also another description @xmath104 , and as a consequence we get :    [ three ] let @xmath105 \\in\\mathbb{z}/2[x_1,x_2,x_3]\\ ] ] be a dickson polynomial .",
    "then every measure in @xmath0 admits an equipartition by a collection of @xmath99 parallel hyperplanes and two additional non - parallel hyperplanes in @xmath100 boxes if @xmath106    * proof : * again , for any mass distribution in @xmath0 and any triple of vectors @xmath107 , let @xmath108 be the oriented hyperplanes orthogonal to @xmath39 , ordered in the direction of the vector @xmath39 , and dividing @xmath0 into @xmath109 regions each containing the same amount ( i.e. @xmath110 ) of the considered mass distribution .",
