    "the slope @xmath9 near midrapidity is a useful observable to characterize the overall strength of directed flow when studying its dependence on beam energy , particle species , centrality , etc .",
    "previous proton @xmath9 measurements for 10 - 40% centrality from star show a sign change and a minimum in the beam energy dependence , whereas antiprotons and charged pions show monotonic behavior throughout @xmath10 to 200 gev and remain negative for all available energies @xcite . in earlier hydrodynamic calculations , a minimum in directed flow",
    "was predicted when the equation of state incorporated a first - order phase transition , while a purely hadronic equation of state predicted a monotonic beam energy dependence @xcite .",
    "however , more recent model calculations with and without phase transitions show only monotonic behavior at bes energies and strongly disagree with the published star proton data @xcite .",
    "the new preliminary @xmath0 measurements presented here for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 at bes energies offer many additional phenomenological details , and are expected to constrain the role of the qcd equation of state in future model descriptions .",

    "the neutrals @xmath3 and @xmath17 are reconstructed using the invariant mass method , identifying decay daughters either using information from the star time projection chamber alone with tight topological cuts , or using broader topological cuts in cases where daughter tracks have tof hits @xcite .",

    "@xcite , namely protons , antiprotons and charged pions at @xmath10 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 and 39 gev . since the new beam energy of @xmath23 gev is now available , the full set of panels for protons , antiprotons and charged pions is shown in fig .",

    "previous measurements of this type were based on the linear term @xmath9 in a cubic fit to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "a cubic fit somewhat reduces sensitivity to the rapidity range over which the fit is performed , but a cubic fit becomes unstable when statistics are poor , as is now the case for @xmath24 , and to a lesser extent , @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in the present analysis , a linear fit over @xmath25 has been used for all particle species at all beam energies .",
    "a noteworthy observation is that @xmath9 for @xmath1 and @xmath3 agree within the uncertainties , and both species changes sign around the same beam energy .",
    "protons show a minimum in @xmath9 near 15 gev , whereas @xmath3 errors are not small enough to draw a conclusion about whether the minimum in proton slope also occurs for @xmath3 .",
    "the slopes for @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 are negative for all beam energies , and @xmath2 and @xmath4 are roughly consistent within errors .",

    "in other words , we expect to find more quarks from stopped initial - state nucleons in the left panel than in the right panel .",
    "the @xmath9 for @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath17 all are negative for all bes energies , and @xmath9 for @xmath17 is consistent with the mean of @xmath26 and @xmath28 within errors .",
    "kaon calculations from hadron string dynamics ( hsd ) @xcite and urqmd @xcite are also compared ( shaded bands ) and show qualitatively similar trends as data at higher energies , but deviate more strongly at lower energies .              in fig .",
    "[ netp ] , a comparison is shown between net - proton @xmath9 and net - kaon @xmath9 .",
    "net - proton @xmath0 is defined according to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the observed rapidity dependence of the ratio of antiprotons to protons .",
    "net - kaon @xmath0 is defined using the same formula , with @xmath1 and @xmath31 replaced by @xmath26 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this net-@xmath1 definition attempts to distinguish between protons from baryon - antibaryon pairs produced near midrapidity , as opposed to protons arising from initial - state baryon number transported to the midrapidity region by stopping .",
    "this distinction in turn is based on the hypothesis that antiprotons and protons from produced quarks have roughly the same directed flow .",
    "final - state interaction effects , such as annihilation and hadronic potentials , complicate the simplified picture above .",
    "it is evident that net-@xmath1 and net-@xmath32 @xmath9 near midrapidity are consistent with each other from 200 gev down to 14.5 gev , begin to diverge at 11.5 gev , and are dramatically different at 7.7 gev .    ) near midrapidity as a function of centrality for @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath33 in au+au collisions .",
    "error bars are statistical only ; systematic errors are generally comparable to statistical errors , but are omitted from these panels to reduce clutter.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    figure [ v1vscent ] shows the centrality dependence of directed flow slope near midrapidity for @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding result for @xmath27 is very similar to @xmath33 and is not shown .",
    "kaons , also not shown , are qualitatively similar to pions but with larger uncertainties .",
    "statistics for @xmath2 and @xmath24 are insufficient for a centrality dependent study .",
    "the centrality dependence for @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 is very strong , with @xmath1 and @xmath3 showing a sign change as centrality is varied while holding beam energy fixed at many of the bes points .",
    "overall , it is evident that there is a rich and detailed structure present in the beam energy and centrality dependence of directed flow for the nine particle species included in the present study .",
    "these measurements already pose a considerable challenge to existing models .",
    "much more comprehensive measurements in the region of high baryon density will be possible with the greatly increased statistics of phase - ii of the rhic beam energy scan @xcite .",
