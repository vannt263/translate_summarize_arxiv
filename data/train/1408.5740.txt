    "in these supplementary notes we elaborate our calculations with some details .      in order to study the impact of absorption on the wave dynamics in photonic waveguide lattices , we consider a one - dimensional array of @xmath1 identical single mode optical waveguides with the width @xmath2 and complex relative permittivity @xmath4 .",
    "we conceive the waveguides written at the positions @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) in polished fused silica bulk material with relative permittivity @xmath7 .",
    "so , everywhere in the glass sample , the relative permittivity is considered to be a complex number ; its real part corresponds to the refractive index while the imaginary part determines the absorption coefficient .",

    "@xmath126 here , @xmath106 is the longitudinal attenuation factor .",
    "we finally end up with the tight - binding evolution equation @xmath127 one of the important features of eq .",
    "is that even after the transformation , the effect of loss is still present in this tight - binding equation and manifests itself in complex coupling coefficients . the imaginary part of the coupling coefficients can be related to the real part by @xmath128 where we have defined @xmath129 the _ absorption discrepancy_. in this equation , @xmath130 is the average distance between adjacent guides .",
    "if the absorption strength of the waveguides is different from their surrounding medium , the longitudinal attenuation of the wavepacket is not uniform in the x - direction .",
    "as we are going to show now , this trait will lead to a diffusive , transverse energy transfer .    although the absorption discrepancy can be positive or negative , depending on the sign of @xmath131 , it is easy to show that eq .",
    "is invariant under transformations @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , in the case of single site excitation at the entrance plane where the latter transformation does not affect the initial condition , the intensity @xmath134 is an even function of @xmath33 , and it is sufficient to investigate the positive values of the absorption discrepancy .",
    "let us finally remark that the corresponding hamiltonian of the tight - binding eq .",
    "is not a hermitian operator and , therefore , the total power @xmath135 is not a conserved quantity , @xmath136 since our aim is to discuss on transverse profile , this lack of conservation is not crucial and in simulations one can normalize the total power in each @xmath43 step to avoid a numerical divergence .      here , we want to show the estimation of the modal overlap integrals of eq . .",

    "we have @xmath145 therefore , the overlap integrals of different modes , i.e. @xmath146 , @xmath147 decay exponentially with waveguide separation .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath148 we can write @xmath149 next , we will focus on the estimation of the real and imaginary part of the coupling coefficient . according to eqs . and , for the real part of @xmath150 we have                  comparing @xmath157 for different values of @xmath158 , we can approximate @xmath157 by the following simple relation .",
