    "the introduction of fictitious boson degrees of freedom permits the derivation of simple mean - field theories , with rotationally invariant order parameters which can not be defined in terms of the original spins . because the procedure explicitly preserves rotational invariance , spontaneous symmetry breaking need not be assumed , in contrast to standard spin - wave approaches .",
    "the method is therefore capable of describing collinear , spiral , and spin - liquid phases within a unified framework , where broken - symmetry phases are represented by bose - condensed phases of schwinger bosons  @xcite . at the mean - field level ,",
    "early schwinger - boson calculations produced quantitatively disappointing results .",
    "however , small changes in the formalism greatly improve its accuracy without unduly complicating its use  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we briefly review the application of the schwinger - boson transformation to quantum heisenberg magnets , beginning with the derivation of a rotationally invariant mean - field theory .",
    "we then show in some detail how gaussian fluctuations around the mean - field solution can be included for arbitrary ( non - bravais ) lattices .",
    "this generalizes the available results , which treat simple lattices . as an application",
    ", we examine the shastry - sutherland model , which has been the subject of renewed interest due to its experimental realization in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the schwinger - boson transformation is an exact mapping from spin to boson degrees of freedom , given by @xmath1 ; here @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the original spin hilbert space corresponds not to the full boson hilbert space but rather to the ( @xmath4)-dimensional subspace in which @xmath5 .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the partition function , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an arbitrary spin hamiltonian transformed to a boson hamiltonian , and the trace is restricted to the physical subspace .",
    "we can replace the restricted trace with a trace over the full boson hilbert space using an appropriate projection operator for each spin : @xmath8 then @xmath9 , which can be rewritten as a functional integral in the usual way .",
    "in particular , we obtain @xmath10 \\exp\\left ( -{\\cal a}[\\phi_{a},\\,\\phi_{b},\\,\\lambda]\\right ) } { \\int{\\cal d}\\lambda\\,\\,\\delta[\\partial_{\\tau}\\lambda ] } , % \\ ] ] where the euclidean action is @xmath11 = \\int_{0}^{\\beta } \\!\\!\\ !",

    "the action ( [ action1 ] ) is invariant under local gauge transformations parametrized by @xmath15 : @xmath16 .",
    "this gauge symmetry is associated with the conservation of total boson number on each site , which holds simply because the magnitude of each spin is constant .",
    "the gauge is partially fixed in eq .",
    "( [ functionalz1 ] ) by the condition that @xmath17 ; the remaining , unfixed , transformations are those where @xmath18 is time - independent .",
    "the action will often have additional symmetries , such as global su(2 ) invariance ; these depend entirely on the symmetries of the spin hamiltonian .",
    "we specialize to the heisenberg hamiltonian , @xmath19 . under the schwinger - boson transformation @xmath20 : @xmath21:@xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and : @xmath25 : is the normal - ordered form of @xmath25 .",
    "the bilinear operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 are invariant under simultaneous su(2 ) rotations of spins @xmath28 and @xmath29 , so they may take on vacuum expectation values even without spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "this makes them convenient order parameters on which to base a mean - field theory . these operators are not , however , invariant under the u(1 ) gauge transformations described earlier ( since they couple physical and unphysical states ) , so such theories retain some gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "these degrees of freedom become important when the order parameters are allowed to fluctuate around their average values .",
    "we write the hamiltonian in a form suitable for lattices with several spins per unit cell : @xmath30 here @xmath31 labels the unit cell , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are site labels within a unit cell , and @xmath34 is a bond label .",
    "we then formulate a mean - field theory with order parameters @xmath35 by introducing complex hubbard - stratonovich fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 , linearly coupling them to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and using them to integrate out the original boson fields @xmath40 .",

    "we will therefore retain the current gauge - fixing condition in what follows , but observe that this quantitatively affects our results , because the saddle - point expansion we use is not controlled by any gauge - invariant small parameter .",
    "by contrast , mean - field theories which take as order parameters either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , but not both , have natural su(n ) generalizations in which the saddle - point expansion is controlled by 1/n  @xcite .    next we look for stationary points of @xmath47 with respect to its arguments .",

    "this procedure breaks rotational invariance and complicates the analysis somewhat , so we do not use it here .",
    "the price we pay is that helices with small pitch can not be accommodated by small clusters with untwisted boundary conditions .",
    "we found that helical mean - field solutions exist for clusters with as few as 24 sites , suggesting that finite - size effects probably do not seriously alter our results on larger clusters .",
    "we used the schwinger - boson method to calculate the ground state energy for @xmath75 .",
    "the mean - field equations can be solved numerically for the full range of @xmath70 . for small @xmath70 ,",

    "when @xmath70 is increased , new solutions with ordering wavevectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 appear through a bifurcation of the nel state ; we identify these solutions as helical states with pitch along the @xmath88-axis and @xmath89-axis respectively .",
    "the helical states are degenerate for square lattices . finally , for sufficiently large @xmath70",
    ", the energy of the helical states exceeds that of the spin - liquid state , and the ground state becomes disordered .",
    "the results for a small cluster ( 16-site , @xmath90 ) are shown in fig .",
    ". the nel state does not undergo any bifurcation here , due to the small size of the cluster .",
    "the schwinger - boson mean - field estimate exceeds the exact ground state energy by a small and roughly constant amount over the full range of @xmath70 . a second - order perturbative calculation around @xmath73 ( that is , around the nel state ) yields similar results in the displayed range (",
    "although naturally perturbation theory is more accurate near @xmath73 ) . finally , the inclusion of gaussian fluctuations in the schwinger - boson calculation improves the accuracy , but for @xmath91 only : for larger @xmath70 the results deteriorate rapidly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the mean - field and gaussian - order results for a larger , rectangular cluster ( 64-site , @xmath92 ) , for which exact results are unavailable ( except for the spin - liquid state ) . in this case the nel state bifurcates at @xmath93 into a helical state with pitch along the @xmath88-axis ( the lower dashed curve ) .",
    "the energy of the nel state is corrected by fluctuations just as in the smaller cluster : it is shifted downward by a small amount until @xmath94 , after which the computed correction becomes large and positive . extrapolating from the small - cluster results",
    ", it seems probable that the upswing is again spurious , and that the true energy is bracketed by the mean - field and gaussian - order results .",
    "the gaussian correction to the energy of the helical state is uniformly positive .",
    "we also checked the mean - field and gaussian - order results for still larger clusters , at selected values of @xmath70 .",
    "the bifurcation point occurs at slightly smaller @xmath70 on larger clusters , approaching @xmath95 in the thermodynamic limit , as seen in ref .",
    "the nature of the corrections does not appear to change .",
    "our conclusion is that the shastry - sutherland model with @xmath75 has a helical ground state , over a range of @xmath70 narrower than that suggested by mean - field schwinger - boson theory .",
    "the range of stable wavevectors for spiral ordering is correspondingly reduced : we estimate that the helical state is stable for @xmath96 , whereas the mean - field theory predicts stability for @xmath97 .",
    "these conclusions are necessarily tentative .",
    "from a practical point of view , these results are not very satisfactory .",
    "although the inclusion of gaussian fluctuations improves the agreement between schwinger - boson theory and exact diagonalization in some regions of parameter space , the improvement is not dramatic .",
    "moreover , the correction is not uniformly good ; it gives little reliable information about the region of interest , where the nel and helical states have comparable energies .",
    "the results can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "it may be that the very good agreement between the mean - field and exact ground - state energies is simply fortuitous ; the partition function may not be dominated by contributions from the neighborhood of the mean - field solution . in that case",
    "no refinement of the present saddle - point expansion will yield better results .",
    "this is a real possibility ; however , since the schwinger - boson mean - field approach also gives accurate results on a number of other systems , it seems unlikely .",
    "it also may be that we have failed to treat the gauge degrees of freedom properly . as noted earlier",

    "when this is done correctly , the effective action for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath63 will be proportional to n ; the saddle - point expansion will then yield an asymptotic series in 1/n , each term of which is gauge - invariant .",
    "this program would put the present work on a sounder theoretical footing , by determining in what limit its results become exact .",
    "the key step is to generalize @xmath38 and @xmath39 simultaneously ; this remains a challenge for the future .",
