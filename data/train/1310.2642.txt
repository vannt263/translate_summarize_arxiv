    "within our solar system , earth and smaller bodies are primarily mixtures of refractories , rock and metals . in the outer solar system ,",
    "bodies that are too small to retain deep atmospheres contain rock and ices . in the larger planets , including uranus and neptune , the light elements h and he dominate the volume .",
    "there no local examples of bodies intermediate in size or mass between earth ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and uranus / neptune , both of which are larger than 3.8 @xmath2 and more massive than 14 m@xmath3 . mass determinations of transiting exoplanets are beginning to allow the characterization of planets in this size range . as more planetary masses and radii",
    "are measured , their bulk densities will provide more constraints on their compositions .    to derive meaningful planetary densities",
    "requires both accurate mass and radius determinations .",
    "the ratio of the planetary radius to the stellar radius is a direct measurement from transit light curves , where the fraction of starlight blocked during transit is a simple measure of the projected area of the planet .",
    "the uncertainty in this measurement typically rests on the accuracy to which the stellar radius can be constrained .",
    "the star 55 cancri is unique as the host of a transiting sub - neptune exoplanet in having a direct measurement of its radius via interferometry @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectral classification of the atmosphere of _ kepler _ host stars gives a model dependent measurement of the stellar radius with an uncertainty of typically 10% .",
    "the measurement of stellar radius from spectral classification and modelling can be improved upon with additional information .",
    "the gold standard for this purpose is where asteroseismic oscillations are detected in the photometric light curve . amongst these stars , uncertainties in mass and radius",
    "can be reduced to @xmath4 , although detections are only available for giant stars and the brightest dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "another constraint on the stellar density , and hence its radius , can be gleaned from the orbital constraints of exoplanets . the scaled semi - major axis ,",
    "@xmath5/@xmath6 , ( where @xmath7 is the stellar radius ) can be estimated roughly from the transit and ingress durations , but accurate measurement of @xmath5/@xmath6  requires additional information about the orbital eccentricity and alignment ( @xmath8 ) , the longitude of pericenter from the passage of the orbiting planet through the sky - plane towards the earth . for a measured fractional transit depth @xmath9 , transit duration @xmath10 , and ingress or egress duration @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of measuring the stellar radius , information about the the orbital eccentricity from dynamical fits , used in eq .",
    "[ arstar ] , can provide an independent constraint on the stellar bulk density following kepler s third law ( @xcite ) : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the bulk density of the star , @xmath15 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath16 is the orbital period of the transiting planet . in their study of kepler-11 , @xcite used dynamical solutions for the orbital eccentricities , alongside high resolution spectra to reduce the uncertainty on the stellar radius to 2% .",
    "the planetary radii were measured with nearly that precision .    of the transiting exoplanets ,",
    "the majority of mass determinations to date are the result of radial velocity ( rv ) spectroscopy , and amongst these , most are the so - called hot jupiters , planets with substantial envelopes that orbit very close to their host star .",
    "the transiting neptunes and sub - neptunes with measured rv masses all have short orbital periods , the longest being kepler-68 b , @xcite at 5.4 days .",
    "note that kepler-18 s planets have had their masses measured by the combined constraints of rv and transit timing variations ( ttvs ) , the farthest one orbiting every 14.9 days @xcite .",
    "ttvs exploit the high degree of accuracy in measuring the transit times of transiting exoplanets , with transit time uncertainties as low as a few minutes in some cases .",
    "these probe interplanetary perturbations , and in general are sensitive to the mass ratio of perturbing neighboring planets to the host star .",
    "the strongest signals in ttvs occur when planets are near ( but not trapped in ) mean motion resonances , and the resonant argument cycles with a periodicity that is well sampled over a baseline of transit timing measurements . near first order resonances , the coherence time is long enough for perturbations to build constructively to an easily detectable amplitude . too far from resonance ,",
    "the perturbations lose their coherence rapidly , and the ttv amplitude is reduced . too near resonance , _ kepler",
    "_ s four years of observations do not cover a complete cycle .",
    "nevertheless , since ttvs are sensitive to interplanetary perturbations and not the effect of the planet on the star , planetary masses can be determined to far greater orbital periods than rv , as long as enough transit times have been measured to detect timing variations .",
    "the super - neptune kepler-30 d , with an orbit period of 143 days @xcite has the longest orbital period for an exoplanet with a mass determination on the mass - radius diagram .",
    "the difference in orbital periods probes by these two separate techniques highlight their respective biases .",
    "rv planets orbit close to their star , are hotter , and several , particularly the earths ; including kepler-10 b @xcite , corot-7 b @xcite , koi-94 b @xcite , kepler-20 b @xcite and potentially kepler-18 b @xcite seem to lack deep atmospheres .",
    "the ttv mass determinations , such as kepler-11 ( @xcite ) , kepler-18 @xcite , kepler-30 @xcite and kepler-36 @xcite are all either compact multiplanet systems with a small period ratio between neighboring planets , or near resonance .",
    "although detecting a ttv signal certainly favors larger masses , the orbital stability of compact multiplanet systems like kepler-11 require smaller masses and/or eccentricies given their neptune - like planetary radii . on a practical note , a compact configuration with high multiplicity",
    "reduces the risk of intermediate , non - transiting planets confusing ttv dynamical models .",
    "koi-152 ( with a _ kepler _ magnitude 13.9 , located at ra = @xmath17 , dec = @xmath18 @xcite ) is an excellent candidate for ttv modeling .",
    "it has four planetary candidates near first order mean motion resonances , with clear evidence of transit timing variations ( ttvs ) .",
    "@xcite first noted ttvs at koi-152 following 6 quarters of data , though only three candidates were known at the time .",
    "these three are near the 1:2:4 resonance suggesting that multi - planet resonances are reasonably common @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted the ttvs at koi-152 , and also found evidence that the inner two planetary candidates have significant eccentricities .",
    "this suggests that circular fits to the transit times would be hampered by the mass - eccentricity degeneracy ( @xcite ) , casting uncertainty on measured masses .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce our methodology for measuring transit times , and in section 3 , we examine the transit timing variations , evaluating the applicability of zero - eccentricity analytical solutions for the planetary masses . in section 4",
    "we describe our numerical models and fits to the transit timing variations , and present our results for the planetary masses and orbital parameters , and stellar parameters .",
    "our analysis confirms that the candidates of koi-152 are planets , and we refer to them as such for the remainder of the paper . in section 5 we consider the potential effects of non - transiting perturbers on our four - planet model . in section 6 we characterize the planets masses , radii and by bulk densities , and in section 7 , we compare our results for koi-152 s planets with other known plamets of masses less than 30 @xmath19 on the mass - radius diagram .",
    "variations in the brightness of koi-152 were monitored with an effective duty cycle exceeding 90% starting at barycentric julian date ( bjd ) 2454964.512 , with all data returned to earth at a cadence of 29.426 minutes ( long cadence , lc ) ; data were also returned at a cadence of 58.85 seconds ( short cadence , sc ) beginning from bjd 2455093.216 . here and throughout we base our timeline for transit data from t = jd-2,454,900 .",
    "our analysis uses short cadence data where available , augmented by the long cadence dataset primarily during the epoch prior to t@xmath20 days , for which no sc data were returned to earth .",
    "we obtained these data from the publicly - accessible mast archive at http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/ .",
    "to measure the transit times from the light curve , we adopt the procedure explained in detail in appendix 7.1 of @xcite . here and throughout we refer to the planets as ` b ' ( koi-152.03 ) , ` c ' ( koi-152.02 ) , ` d ' ( koi-152.01 ) , and ` e ' ( koi-152.04 ) in order of their orbital periods .",
    "we begin with the orbital periods based on a linear fit to the observed transit times , summarized in table  [ tbl - intro ] .",
    "we shall solve for the orbital parameters of these planets at t = 780.0 days , an epoch chosen to be near the middle of our dataset .",
    "for each candidate , the first transit time after this chosen epoch , calculated from a linear ephemeris to the set of transit times is at time @xmath21 .",
    ".a linear fit to sixteen quarters of _ kepler _ s observed transit times for the planets at koi-152 , specified as orbital periods and the first calculated transit time after t = 780 days .",

    "the planetary bulk densities follow from the constraint in stellar density : @xmath22 each of the terms in parentheses in equation  [ rhoplanet ] is an independent source of uncertainty that we add in quadrature .",
    "we use this formula because it provides a more appropriate accounting of the uncertainties than the uncertainties in the planetary masses and radii . due to the tight constraints on stellar and planetary radii ,",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty here is planet - to - star mass ratios from our dynamical models .",
    "nevertheless , all four candidates can be characterized as having low bulk density , due to the retention of volatiles .",
    "koi-152 b has the highest bulk density ( albeit with large uncertainties ) , despite having a similar radius to koi-152 c and e. the nominal density of koi-152 b is slightly less than a pure ice world of the same mass , suggesting either a substantial mass fraction of water and/or a relatively thin h / he envelope , with heavy elements in the interior .",
    "koi-152 c and e have similar characteristics to the planets of kepler-11 d and e ( @xcite ) , and likely have envelopes that are far more significant by volume than by mass @xcite .",
    "the bulk density of koi-152 d is the lowest for a _ kepler _ planet measured to date .",
    "although the temperature of koi-152 d is unknown , its place on the mass - radius diagram appears to give its envelope a total mass ( as a fraction of the planetary mass ) of around 50@xmath23 at t = 500k , roughly 10@xmath23 at 1000 k , @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of a planet assumes zero albedo and no internal heat source , and depends solely on the temperature of the host star and the orbital distance . for low eccentricities ,",
    "@xmath24 given its distance from the star , the equilibrium temperature of koi-152 d is 634@xmath25 16 k. hence , it appears reasonable that koi-152 d has an h / he envelope that contributes significantly more than 10@xmath23 of the planetary mass , but less than 50@xmath23 of the mass .",
    "here we plot neptunes and sub - neptunes on the mass - radius diagram , including all planets with measured radii and masses , with nominal mass determinations up to 30 @xmath19 .",
    "these include mass determinations by radial velocity spectroscopy ( rv ) as well as ttvs .",
    "we adopt the data from published studies that include the most recent stellar spectral classification and mass determinations for : hat - p-11 b ( kepler-3 b ) @xcite hat - p-26 b @xcite , 55 cancri e ( @xcite ) , gj 3470 b @xcite , gj 436 b ( @xcite ) , gj 1214 b ( @xcite ) , corot-7 b ( @xcite ) , kepler-4 b , @xcite , kepler-10 b @xcite , kepler-11 b - f @xcite , kepler-18 b - d @xcite , kepler-30 b and d @xcite , kepler-36 b and c @xcite , kepler-68 b @xcite , and koi-94b @xcite .",
    "we exclude koi-94 c ( @xmath26 ) and koi-94 e ( @xmath27 ) from the mass - radius diagram because their masses are poorly constrained , and in the case of koi-94 e , its nominal mass is beyond 30 @xmath19 .",
    "for the solar system , we adopt data given in @xcite .    the planets in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - r ] are all compared to theoretical models of pure water ice , silicate rock , or iron planets .",
    "model curves for planetary radii of planets made from pure ice , rock or iron follow the results of @xcite .",
    "several features stand out from fig .",
    "[ fig : m - r ] .",
    "firstly , amongst the sub - neptunes , ttv planets are systematically larger and hence less dense than rv planets in the same mass range .",
    "this is most likely due to the biases of both techniques .",
    "since rv detectability declines rapidly with orbital distance , few rv masses have been measured beyond a few days orbital period , and several of the planets in the rv sample may well have suffered mass loss from the intense stellar radiation upon their atmospheres . on the other hand ,",
    "the ttv systems are all dynamically compact multiplanet systems , where for a given planetary size , smaller masses are more likely to permit stable orbits ( even though a larger mass makes the ttvs more detectable ) .",
    "furthermore , for planets in multiplanets systems of a particular mass , the larger ( and hence lower density ) planets can have their transit times measured more accurately for ttv anlysis .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m - r ] highlights the two orders of magnitude in the range in planetary densities that are observed in the mass range up to 30 @xmath19 .",
    "the rv density determinations appear more tightly correlated than the ttv determinations , although the uncertainty in density for the low mass , low density ttv planets are certainly larger .",
    "note that in this plot we show planetary radii from a mass limited sample .",
    "for given masses , and thus given detectability considerations , larger planets have more precise transit timing measurements .",
    "there is thus a bias in ttv detections to large , low density planets , and not massive , smaller planets .",
    "this selection effect is part of the reason that the @xmath28 curve declines to the right .",
    "nominally , koi-152 d has the lowest planetary bulk density of exoplanets measured to date , although kepler-12 b , with a mass of 137 @xmath19 , and radius of 19 @xmath2 , has a very similar bulk density within uncertainties .",
    "koi-152 d is twenty times less massive than kepler-12 b , and also receives roughly 30 times less insolation than kepler-12 b @xcite .",
    "it is significantly less dense than other characterized sub - saturn mass planets .",
    "if we parametrize the ratio of the planetary radius to the radius of a planet of the same mass composed purely of ice , or rock , we have a simple test of whether the planet has retained a substantial gaseous envelope .",
    "planets that are less dense than water ice , ( above the blue line in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iceline ] ) , are likely to have a volumetrically substantial h / he envelope .",
    "planets that are more dense than pure silicate rock , ( below the brown line in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iceline ] ) , are less likely to retain a substantial amount of volatiles . between these two limits , the atmosphere of a planet can not be determined without more information , since it is unknown in what proportions volatiles are likely to be present in the form of ices and gases .",
    "nevertheless , we surmise from fig .",
    "[ fig : iceline ] that planets with @xmath29 appear unlikely to retain significant atmosphere , and from the bottom panel that planets with @xmath30 are very likely to retain deep atmospheres .",
    "all the characterized planets in our chosen mass range show remarkably little scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig : iceline ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfrockline ] , we show the equilibrium temperature of the planet against their radii relative to pure rock or ice .",
    "we see an abrupt transition around 1050 k. at higher temperatures , there is no evidence of planets harboring substantial gases , and below this temperature , a wide range of densities appears permissible .",
    "one possible exception is kepler-4b , with a equilibrium temperature of 1614 k , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite estimated that kepler-4b retains a deep h / he atmosphere of about 4 - 6@xmath23 by mass .",
    "of the  hot \" planets below 30 @xmath19 , kepler-4b is alone in requiring a deep atmosphere .",
    "nevertheless , we still see a much wider range in bulk densities amongst the cool sub - neptunes .",
    "kepler-36 stands out as having two planets that are close in orbital periods ( 13.84 and 16.24 days respectively , @xcite ) , with remarkably different densities .",
    "these planets appear to straddle the transition in equilibrium temperature at @xmath33 k , with the outer planet retaining an atmosphere , and the inner one denser than pure silicate rock @xcite .",
    "koi-152 b lies close to kepler-36 c on this plot , with a blackbody temperature of 1004 @xmath25 24 k , although it is marginally denser . amongst the `` cool '' sub - neptunes , no exoplanets that are denser than pure rock have yet been discovered",
    "assuming a four - planet model for the ttvs in the four transiting candidates of koi-152 , we have added four sub - uranus masses to the mass - radius diagram , bringing the total to twenty exoplanets .",
    "we confirm the planetary nature of these candidates and that they are planets in the same system .",
    "the planets of koi-152 appear to follow the trend of the planets orbiting kepler-11 , being of low density with significant envelopes .",
    "nevertheless , the planets show remarkable variety in their bulk masses .",
    "koi-152 b , c and e all have radii between 3.5 and 4.0 @xmath2 , and yet their masses range from @xmath343 to @xmath3413 @xmath19 , and their bulk densities range from 0.3 to 1.6 g @xmath35 .",
    "the largest planet , koi-152 d , ( @xmath36 ) , has a remarkably low mass given its size , and most likely has the lowest nominal bulk density amongst known planets with sub - saturn masses ."
