    "the infall of low - metallicity gas onto the milky  way is a crucial component of virtually all galactic formation and evolution scenarios .",
    "the simple closed - box model of chemical evolution assumes no infall , inflow , or outflow within the given region being modeled , and is successful at explaining many of the observational characteristics of the galactic disk .",
    "however , it fails to reproduce the metallicity distribution of nearby g- and k - dwarfs , the so - called `` g - dwarf problem '' ( pagel 1994 ; flynn & morell 1997 ) , related to the well - known paucity of metal - poor g- and k - dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "closed - box models , in which star formation proceeds as some functional form dependent upon local gas density , tend to overproduce low - metallicity stars before self - enrichment affects subsequent generations of stars .",
    "conversely , infall models are attractive because galactic disk formation proceeds by gradual accretion of pristine or partially processed material .",
    "the initial reservoir of @xmath8 gas in a given volume of the disk is presumed to be negligible , and the number of first generation stars is likewise negligible .",
    "the processed ejecta of this first generation mixes with infalling low - metallicity gas , and a second , more substantial , generation of star formation begins , now with @xmath9 .",
    "this process continues , presumably unabated , to the present day , regulated in a manner that recovers the local g - dwarf metallicity distribution and avoids the overproduction of metal - poor disk stars ( , pagel 1994 ; figure  23 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that infalling fuel does not necessarily need to be pristine in order to satisfy the g - dwarf problem . under the scenario explored by tosi ( 1988 ) , for example",
    ", infalling gas metallicities can be replaced by [ s / h ] for the arguments that follow . ] [ o / h]@xmath10@xmath11.0 yield results essentially indistinguishable from primordial metallicity gas .",
    "infalling gas metallicities [ o / h]@xmath11@xmath10.5 can be ruled out , owing to their inability to recover the present - day radial distribution of region oxygen abundances in the galactic disk ; intermediate - metallicities @xmath11.0@xmath10[o / h]@xmath10@xmath10.5 are marginally consistent with this same region constraint .",
    "more sophisticated models , based upon the dual infall scenario of chiappini  ( 1999 ) , are currently being examined and are discussed elsewhere ( gibson et  al . 2001,2002 ) .    while tenable theoretically , observational proof of the existence of this infalling low - metallicity galactic fuel had been difficult to obtain prior to the work of wakker  ( 1999a , b ) .",
    "larson ( 1972 ) suggested that the population of galactic high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) was the most likely culprit , a scenario that has been explored in detail by tosi ( 1988 ) .",
    "hvcs are defined as neutral hydrogen clouds travelling at velocities incompatible with those allowed by differential galactic rotation ( , wakker , van woerden & gibson 1999c , and references therein ) . despite the ubiquity of hvcs , with a sky covering factor as great as 37% (",
    "murphy , lockman & savage 1995 ) , our ignorance concerning their distance and metallicity makes an unambiguous identification of the galactic hvcs as infalling galactic fuel very difficult .",
    "wakker  ( 1999a , b ) derive a metallicity of [ s / h]=@xmath11.05@xmath20.12 for one portion of hvc complex  c , using the background seyfert mrk  290 as a probe of the intervening gas .",
    "this metallicity is @xmath12 times lower , for example , than that encountered in the magellanic stream ( [ /]=@xmath10.5 ; gibson  2000 ) .",
    "this metallicity is also consistent with tosi s infalling galactic fuel model .",
    "wakker  conclude that complex  c is a proto - typical example of infalling low - metallicity gas responsible for fueling galactic star formation . as they discuss , the _ source  of this infalling gas could be primordial gas left over from the formation of the galaxy , or from mildly - processed gas stripped from local group dwarfs , and remains undetermined .",
    "more metal - rich hvcs must have another association , such as tidal disruption of the magellanic clouds ( lu  1998 ; gibson  2000 ) or galactic fountains ( richter  1999 ) ( galactic waste ) and are unlikely candidates for galactic fuel . because of the implications for galactic formation and evolution , we have undertaken further analysis of complex  c to confirm the inferred low metallicity through studies of four additional sightlines . _    in   [ data ] , we present the data and analysis for five hst ghrs and stis targets , mrk  290 , 817 , 279 , 501 , and 876 .",
    "each target probes the intervening gas associated with hvc complex  c. because sulfur is little affected by depletion onto dust ( savage & sembach 1996 ; figure  6 ) , the column densities provided by the @xmath131250,1253,1259 lines yield a robust measure of the metallicity of complex  c and form the basis for much of our analysis .",
    "the hvc gas probed by mrk  290 appears to be of low metallicity ( @xmath00.1@xmath6 solar ) , confirming the work of wakker  ( 1999a , b ) .",
    "the mrk  817 and mrk  279 sightlines , however , probe complex  c gas that appears to be more metal - rich ( @xmath00.2@xmath10.4@xmath6 solar ) .",
    "conversely , the neutral nitrogen abundance along the mrk  876 sightline is @xmath140.1@xmath6 solar .",
    "we attempt to reconcile these new observations with the mrk  290 data by invoking variable ionization conditions within complex  c. to first order , such a reconciliation is difficult .",
    "we summarize our results in ",
    "[ summary ] and briefly discuss the implications of known published and preliminary metallicity measurements of complex  c made with fuse .",
    "we then suggest future observational tests with hst , fuse , and 21 cm telescopes that may unequivocally discriminate between the low - metallicity galactic fuel and associations appropriate for higher metallicity gas .",
    "the analysis of wakker  ( 1999a , b ) was restricted to a single probe of complex  c , provided by the background seyfert mrk  290 .",
    "a byproduct of the stocke - shull hst ghrs and stis program on the origin and physical conditions in the low - redshift ly@xmath7 forest ( hst pid#6593@xmath157345 ) has been the serendipitous detection of several major high- and intermediate - velocity cloud complexes ( penton , stocke & shull 2000 ) .",
    "our analysis of magellanic stream absorption features is described elsewhere ( gibson  2000 ) .",
    "five of the 31 targets in our full ghrs@xmath15stis sample , including mrk  290 , intersect the foreground hvc complex  c. figure  [ fig : map ] shows a 2100deg@xmath16 region of complex  c , constructed from the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ; hereafter , lds ) . to avoid confusion with galactic low- and intermediate - velocity gas ,",
    "we show only the velocity range @xmath17kms@xmath5 in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "the five targets discussed in the present complex  c abundance analysis ( mrk  290 , 817 , 279 , 501 , and 876 ) are labeled appropriately .",
    "the complex  c column densities n ( ) along each sightline span an order of magnitude , ranging from @xmath18@xmath19 ( mrk  876 sightline ) to @xmath20@xmath19 ( mrk  290 ) .",
    "we use the effelsberg data of wakker  ( 2001 ) in the analysis that follows ; the relevant column densities are listed in column 6 of table  [ tbl : summary ] .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that these column densities are derived using the 10@xmath21 effelsberg beam , while the absorption measurements discussed below sample gas at far higher sub - arcsecond scale resolution .",
    "it remains an open question as to how accurately emission radio measurements represent the gas that is sampled in the pencil beam represented by absorption measurements .",
    "variations as large as a factor of five in n ( ) may be encountered at the arcminute level ( wakker & schwarz 1991 ) . however , for seven targets for which both @xmath141@xmath21 and 10@xmath21@xmath112@xmath21 data exists ( table  1 of wakker  2001 ) , the ratio of n()@xmath22/n()@xmath23 is only 0.90@xmath20.13 ( with extrema of 0.75 and 1.24 ) .",
    "this might lead one to conclude that such spatial resolution limitations are not as critical as first imagined , although this conclusion is based upon only seven data points .",
    "comparisons have also been made of n ( ) derived from 21  cm mapping with measurements of n ( ) derived from ly@xmath7 absorption along the lines of sight to early type stars in the galactic halo ( lockman , hobbs & shull 1986 ) and toward extragalactic sources ( savage  2000 ) .",
    "the ratio n()@xmath24 / n()@xmath25 is somewhat less than unity , with a variation of less than @xmath250% , in agreement with the n()@xmath22/n()@xmath23 comparison noted above .    in summary",
    ", we adopt a conservative first - order estimate of the uncertainty of the adopted n ( ) for each sightline due to this mismatch in resolution of @xmath20.2dex ( @xmath250% ) .",
    "it remains possible that we may have been unfortunate enough to encounter a line of sight with a 10@xmath21-inferred n ( ) that differs from the `` pencil beam '' n ( ) by a factor of five or more .",
    "higher resolution radio mapping will better address this possibility .",
    "table  [ tbl : obs ] lists the 12 hst spectra , distributed over the five targets employed in the present study ; all but one ( mrk  876 ) are ghrs g160 m data . of the ghrs data , only one spectrum ( mrk  501 ) was a pre - costar observation .",
    "the data for mrk  290 ( pi : wakker ; pid # 6590 ) and mrk  876 ( pi cot : pid # 7295 ) were extracted from the hst archive , to supplement the three targets from our go programs .",
    "details concerning spectrum preparation are described by penton  ( 2000 ) .    in deriving the metallicity of complex  c , we have employed two different techniques , one based upon the assumption of optically - thin absorption features , and the other based upon the apparent optical depth method of sembach & savage ( 1992 ) . in the weak - line ( optically - thin ) limit , the column density n@xmath26 ( in @xmath19 ) and equivalent width of a line w@xmath27 ( in m )",
