    "it is believed in statistical physics that the superfluid transition in two - component fermi systems with attractive binary interactions is related to the appearance of long - range order in the so - called _ anomalous _ averages  @xcite . in symmetry breaking theories such as the bcs one , this feature corresponds to a non - vanishing value for the gap function defined as : @xmath121 which plays the role of the order parameter of the phase transition in a ginzburg - landau approach . in number conserving approaches , quantities like ( [ eq : anomalous ] ) are zero .",

    "<S> a recently developed quantum monte carlo algorithm based on the stochastic evolution of hartree - fock states has been applied to compute the static correlation functions of a one - dimensional model of attractively interacting two component fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results have been extensively compared to existing approximate approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover to a condensate of pairs can be identified as the first - order pair coherence extending throughout the whole size of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of revealing the onset of the transition with other observables such as the density - density correlations or the second - order momentum space correlations is discussed . </S>"
