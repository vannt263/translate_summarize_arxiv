    "one of the prime unresolved issues in the dynamics and evolution of galaxy disks remains the origin and evolution of large - scale bar and spiral structure .",
    "though the persistence of grand - design spirals has been tied observationally to the presence of bars or companions @xcite , virtually nothing is known about the actual lifetimes of spiral patterns . additionally , despite indications that the relation between bar and spiral pattern speeds ( which @xcite first argued may not be equal ) may be important for understanding the role of bars in angular momentum transfer during secular disk evolution ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , there are as yet unanswered questions about the connections between multiple patterns in different radial zones . while mode - coupling between patterns , which allows efficient outward angular momentum transfer in disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) seems a most promising link , in 2d n - body simulations with a dissipative gas component @xcite find evidence for spiral structure in the absence of a bar , bar - spiral mode coupling , spiral - spiral mode coupling , and multiple pattern speeds without mode coupling .    clearly , to address questions about the persistence of spiral patterns and the relation between bars and spirals requires not only determination of the pattern speed but how it varies with radius",
    "; only with accurate measurement of bar and spiral or inner and outer spirals pattern speeds in the same galaxy can we confirm whether spiral structure is steady or winding , whether bars and spiral pattern speeds are equal or are unrelated , whether mode - coupling exists , and the domain and number of patterns that can be sustained in a disk .",
    "because they are not directly accessible through observation , pattern speeds are often determined with indirect means such as the identification of predicted behavior at resonance radii ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) or kinematic and morphological comparisons of simulated and observed structure ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also clearly desirable to employ methods for estimating pattern speeds which do not rely on theoretical models or simulation .",
    "many other pattern speed determinations have therefore centered on the use of the model - independent method of tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ; hereafter tw ) which presents a rigorous derivation for the pattern speed @xmath1 based on the requirement of continuity using observationally accessible quantities .",
    "the determination of @xmath1 involves surface density - weighted position and velocity line integrals parallel to the galaxy major axis under several essential assumptions .",
    "specifically , the method requires that the disk of the galaxy is flat ( unwarped ) and contains a single , well - defined rigidly - rotating pattern ; that the surface density of a kinematic tracer of a disk component , which must obey continuity , becomes negligibly small at some radius and all azimuths within the map boundary ( thereby critically yielding converged integrals ) ; and that the relation between the emission from this component and its surface density is linear , or if not , suspected deviations from linearity can be modeled .    in that",
    "information from all sampled radii is associated with a single , constant pattern speed , the tw calculation poses a challenge for extracting multiple distinct or radially varying pattern speeds .",
    "non - axisymmetric structures beyond a dominant pattern such as a bar in the disk of a galaxy will interfere with the measurement of @xmath1 of the bar ; when a non - axisymmetric disk can be decomposed into two components with different pattern speeds , then the tw estimate is a luminosity- and asymmetry - weighted average of the two patterns @xcite .",
    "the tw estimate for the secondary pattern speed in the inner disk of ngc 6946 observed in h@xmath2 , for example , is estimated to be limited to an uncertainty of as much as 50% given the primary pattern s contribution to the tw integrals @xcite .",
    "such issues notwithstanding , there have been several recent adaptations of the tw method to positive effect .",
    "applications of the tw method to sb0 galaxies using stellar light as a tracer extend the limits of integration in the tw calculation to just past the end of the bar in order to minimize contributions to the tw integrals from non - axisymmetric ( and several magnitudes dimmer ) features beyond the bar ; in such cases , integrating past the structure of interest is found to be sufficient for achieving converged integrals .",
    "the bar pattern speeds in ngc 7079 @xcite and ngc 1023 @xcite , for example , have both been successfully measured in this way",
    ".    when there exist more than one pattern in distinct radial zones , however , arguments about the convergence of the tw integrals are less straight - forward . to measure the secondary bar pattern speed in ngc 2950 ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite explore decoupling the inner secondary and outer primary bar pattern speeds by associating each component with unique surface brightness contributions in the tw calculation .",
    "the tw integrals are modified by the presence of the inner pattern based on an assumption about how and where the two patterns decouple ( to first order ) .",
    "this analysis has confirmed the existence of , if not measured , a unique secondary bar pattern speed possibly indicating counter - rotation with respect to the primary bar .    at their best  improving the accuracy of pattern speed estimates to about 20% @xcite  these kinds of adaptations of the tw method for measurement of single or multiple patterns still require assumptions about bar extent based on morphological or kinematic signatures . to separate the observed surface brightness in ngc 2950 into secondary and primary bars components",
    ", @xcite must assume that the patterns indeed decouple at the inner - bar end , or that the outer pattern is axially symmetric at least within the inner s extent .",
    "there , the transition between the two is inferred from the location of a plateau in the tw surface brightness - weighted position integral as the limits of integration are extended from zero . perhaps more critically ,",
    "as investigated in @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] , the direct association of bar length measured in this manner ( or perhaps others ) with pattern extent may introduce error into tw calculations .",
    "furthermore , adaptations of the tw method based on this type of identification are likely to be inapplicable for spiral pattern estimation . in spiral galaxies , not only can identifying transitions between patterns be less clear , but non - axisymmetric motions are significantly smaller ( e.g. @xcite ) than in bars ( at least those typically analyzed with the tw method ) .",
    "indeed , the tw method has yet to be tested on a simulated spiral .",
    "a recent modification to the tw calculation ( merrifield , rand & meidt 2006 ; hereafter mrm ) in which @xmath1 is allowed radial variation promises to be an invaluable resource for tests of long - lived density wave theories and for understanding the connection , if any , between bar and spiral pattern speeds . like the tw method ,",
    "the so - called radial tw ( twr ) method uses measurements of observables to extract radially varying pattern speeds .",
    "as first applied using the bima survey of nearby galaxies co observations of the grand - design sb galaxy ngc 1068 ( mrm ) , the twr method returned a spiral pattern speed solution that declines with radius , allowing a winding time for the pattern to be estimated ( e.g. mrm ) .",
    "as described in mrm , the nature of the discretized calculation presents numerical solutions that are highly susceptible to fluctuations as a result of compounded noise in the data . in this paper ( @xmath3 [ sec : regularization ] )",
    ", we develop the twr method with regularization as a means of smoothing intrinsically noisy solutions as well as testing model solutions of different radial dependence ( described in @xmath3 [ sec : smooth ] ) .",
    "these and other commendations notwithstanding , with regularization one may risk introducing an unrealistic prejudice to twr solutions . in @xmath3 [ sec : bias ] , we address a means of identifying when this is likely to occur , and in @xmath3 [ sec : fourier ] describe a scheme for minimizing such regularization - induced bias .    using evidence that arises from these considerations , as well as other a priori information , theoretically and observationally motivated models for @xmath4 can be developed which constrain the number and extent of patterns present in a disk .",
    "once solutions for these models are calculated , the goodness of each must be assessed in order to identify the best - fit solution . in @xmath3 [ sec : weight ] , we outline the criteria with which the models are judged and describe our concept of error evaluation in the final solutions .    beginning in @xmath3 [ sec : nbody ] ,",
    "we analyze three simulated galaxies with known pattern speeds ( a barred spiral , a slowly winding spiral , and a double barred spiral , marking the first application of the tw method to simulated spiral patterns ) in order to develop a general stratagem for application to real galaxies . as applied to these simulations , we find that the twr method is able to extract multiple pattern speeds with accuracies on the order of ( and , as we will see in some cases , better than ) the traditional tw method . with the barred spiral simulation in @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ]",
    "we show that twr bar pattern speed measurement presents an improvement over traditional tw bar estimates , particularly when there is evidence of a significant contribution from the spiral pattern to the tw integrals .",
    "we find that the regularized twr method can recover information from both patterns effectively by identifying and treating the bar - to - spiral transition radius ( which the tw values themselves may not indicate ) as a free parameter in the calculation . in @xmath3 [ sec",
    ": ierror ] , we analyze the results of the method in detail , particularly with regard to morphological limitations .",
    "we compare our twr results with tw estimates in @xmath3 [ sec : twtwr ] and examine the influence of systematic errors due to the assumed disk position angle and inclination ( shown to be crucial for tw estimates in @xcite ) on both in @xmath3 [ sec : err ] .",
    "we also explore the reliability of a fixed parameterization for the bar - to - spiral transition radius .",
    "( @xmath3 [ sec : trans ] ) .    in the last third of the paper ,",
    "we investigate the prospects for extracting spiral pattern speed solutions that are winding in nature ( @xmath3 [ sec : sim2 ] ) , marking the first application of the tw method to a spiral simulation , and in @xmath3 [ sec : sim3 ] we address the use of the twr method for the purposes of parameterizing an independently rotating nuclear bar in a double barred simulation .",
    "there , the techniques we employ for decoupling and extracting measurements of the pattern speeds of both the primary and secondary bar components may present an interesting corollary to recent attempts with the tw method to measure secondary bar pattern speeds in the presence of a strong primary bar pattern .",
    "we note here that the twr method is a generalized version of the procedure used on ngc 2950 ( see @xcite ) ; separating the surface brightness into two components can be thought of as the coarsest version of the discretization that is the back - bone of numerical twr solutions .",
    "based on our experience with these simulations , we conclude with comments on the applicability of the method to observations of real galaxies in @xmath3 [ sec : caveats ] where we also outline a general prescription for using the twr calculation with regularization .",
    "by proceeding under the aforementioned assumptions of tremaine @xmath5 weinberg ( 1984 ) , but allowing that @xmath1 may possess spatial variation in the radial direction whereby the surface density of the chosen tracer can be written @xmath6 , with appropriate mathematical generalizations , the derivation and measurement of the pattern speed @xmath4 can be made from observable intensities and kinematics of a chosen tracer .    following the derivation given in mrm , integrating the continuity equation obeyed by the tracer ( with the replacement @xmath7 ) @xmath8 over @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( thereby eliminating the unobservable @xmath11 and the spatial derivative @xmath12 ) , and changing from cartesian to polar coordinates yields @xmath13 a final integration with respect to @xmath14 results in a volterra integral equation of the first kind for @xmath4 : @xmath15r\\right\\}\\omega_p(r)dr=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\sigma v_y dx \\label{eq : volt}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "note that with constant @xmath1 in equation ( [ eq : volt ] ) , we arrive at the regular tw result @xmath17 which , with normalization by @xmath18 ( e.g. @xcite ) , leads to @xmath19 where @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22=@xmath23 and @xmath20@xmath9@xmath22=@xmath24 .    for a galaxy projected onto the sky plane with inclination @xmath25 ( so to distinguish from index @xmath26 ) , both the kernel on the left and the integral on the right of equation ( [ eq : volt ] ) are observationally determined quantities with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the coordinates in the plane of the sky along the major and minor axes , respectively , and @xmath32 is the observed line - of - sight velocity .",
    "solutions can be extracted numerically by replacing the integral on the left with a discrete quadrature for different values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see figure [ fig - quad ] ) whereby equation ( [ eq : volt ] ) is converted to @xmath35 or to a matrix equation of the form : @xmath36 with @xmath37 an upper triangular @xmath38 square matrix . note that numerical quadratures on either side of the galaxy ( @xmath10 @xmath200 or or @xmath10 @xmath220 ) occur independently , providing two measures of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , as governed by the information available , the slices which delimit the quadrature on a single side need not be uniformly spaced . in this case",
    ", solutions inherit a variable bin width @xmath39 .",
    "also , the calculation allows for no azimuthal dependence for the pattern speed , which we assume throughout .",
    "the size of @xmath37 depends on the desired coarseness or fineness of the quadrature ; the separation between slices at positions @xmath40 ( limited by either the resolution or the sampling of the data ) translates into a radial bin width ( modulo @xmath41 ) via equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) .",
    "the quadrature , perhaps more critically , depends on the limits of integration in equation ( [ eq : volt ] ) .",
    "these limits @xmath42 should be chosen based on where the integrals have converged . while in the case of a single bar pattern integrating past the structure of interest is often suitable , as shown in @xcite ( figures 9 - 11 ) , in the presence of strong , extended asymmetry tw values are highly dependent on the extent of integration along each slice @xmath26 . in cases where multiple patterns exist in a single disk , then",
    ", it is equally favorable ( and hopefully sufficient ) to extend all integrals to the edge of the surface brightness distribution .",
    "meeting the requirement of integral convergence in this manner as applied to the twr calculation determines the location of the last radial bin @xmath43 associated with elements @xmath44 along each slice . for a given radial bin width , with the requirement that @xmath43 equals @xmath45 we are presented with the size of @xmath37 as well as the outermost slice position , since @xmath43 must also equal @xmath46 .",
    "one should check to see that @xmath47 , the last entry in @xmath37 associated with the outermost slice , is associated with a fully converged @xmath48 ( which achieves convergence at least by the map boundary ) .    since @xmath37 is an upper triangular matrix ,",
    "the @xmath49 can be solved for via simple back - substitution . in this way",
    ", solutions are generated from the outermost to the innermost radius ( from light gray to black in figure [ fig - quad ] ) according to @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( from eq .",
    "[ eq : twr ] ) .",
    "such solutions , however , are especially susceptible to wildly oscillatory behavior as errors from large radii propagate inward .",
    "these compounded errors arise from uncertainties in the velocities and intensities ( which get translated into the @xmath52 ) and can be particularly severe since the outermost bins often cover the lowest signal - to - noise regions in the data .",
    "the errors thus introduced can be systematic .",
    "figure [ fig - unregularized ] shows an example of ( unregularized ) twr solutions for two different binnings using data from the barred spiral simulation of @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] . by increasing the bin width the largest oscillations",
    "are reduced , but ( as will become clearer ) even tripling the bin width will not necessarily limit the propagation of noise to the level required for the extraction of realistic solutions .",
    "( a more thorough discussion of the implications for twr solutions will be deferred until the beginning of @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] . )",
    "though the initial application of the twr method on a real galaxy , namely ngc 1068 ( mrm ) , showed little of the oscillatory behavior common to noisy , discretized volterra - type solutions ( outside @xmath53@xmath541.5 kpc , anyway ) , the solutions were generated over relatively few bins ( only five at most , over the region @xmath53=1.5 to 2.8 kpc ) .",
    "in general , while large bin widths can often minimize the propagation of noise in the calculation , they can be expected to compromise solutions , as will be discussed in the sections to follow ; naturally , the smaller the quadrature element , the more accurately the true radial variation of the pattern speed can be ascertained .",
    "this is particularly critical as applied to disks sustaining multiple patterns where , as described later , a certain degree of radial precision is required for accurate separation of the pattern speeds .    barring a large , limiting resolution",
    ", one should expect to be able to perform a sufficiently smooth quadrature wherein the number of elements in @xmath37 becomes large .",
    "since more elements in @xmath37 ( and more bins over which to generate solutions ) result in intrinsically noisy behavior  an effect most pronounced in the inner - most bins  gaining a finer , more accurate quadrature often means forfeiting control of the solution . by combining regularization with the twr calculation to force a smooth solution , however",
    ", one can counter this effect while maintaining the required precision .",
    "regularization also serves to alleviate the impact of non - global features that are most likely not included in the overall pattern ( and which can singularly introduce large errors into the integrals ) . since rapid fluctuations in @xmath4",
    "are penalized , discrepant points need not be avoided or ignored ( as demanded in performing the twr calculation on ngc 1068 in mrm ) . while one may also use the alternative , which would be to fit models of @xmath1 directly to equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) and perform a grid - search to find the best model form and coefficients , we pursue regularization here , its speed making it preferred .",
    "our procedure entails the following . as a modification to the @xmath55 estimator minimized by solutions @xmath49 of equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) , namely @xmath56 with implicit sum over @xmath26 ( and @xmath57 ) and errors @xmath58 representing the measurement error of the @xmath59 data point @xmath60",
    ", we introduce a regularizing operator , or smoothing functional @xmath61 , containing a priori information in the manner of tikhonov - miller regularization ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in which ( in matrix form ) solutions @xmath62 minimize @xmath63 here , the elements of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , and the role of @xmath68controlling the relative amount of @xmath55 minimization on the left to entropy maximization on the right  is explicit",
    ".    reduced to a linear set of normal equations , this minimization returns smoothed solutions according to a modified version of equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) : @xmath69 note that the regularizing functional , not necessarily upper triangular , introduces an anticipatory quality to solutions @xmath49 whereby all bins at the same radius are coupled . furthermore , solving for components @xmath49 no longer only involves a procedure like back - substitution , but requires rather an l - u decomposition ( for instance ) as well .",
    "the real power in applying regularization to twr calculations is in the freedom to choose how the smoothness of solutions is achieved . for the purposes of distinguishing between different possible radial dependences for @xmath70",
    ", we choose @xmath61 to reflect a priori assumptions based on simple expectations from theory and observation .",
    "model solutions , then , each incorporating its own @xmath61 , represent smoothed , testable realizations of the pattern speed .",
    "these we restrict to simple forms in order to minimize the additional amount of information to be extracted from the data relative to the traditional tw method .",
    "for polynomial solutions , we consider only constant , linear and quadratic radial dependence .",
    "the elements of the smoothing @xmath61 are associated with the minimization of the @xmath71 derivative of @xmath70 for each polynomial solution of order @xmath72 .",
    "for instance , for linear solutions this entails minimizing @xmath73 whereupon @xmath74    one may also choose a form for @xmath61 that identifies two or more distinct regions of independent radial behavior by invoking a step - function model . for the case of a barred spiral with a constant bar and quadratic spiral , for instance",
    ", this corresponds to minimizing @xmath75 the elements of @xmath61 with @xmath76 reflect the a priori assumption that the bar pattern speed is constant , while those for @xmath77 associate a quadratically varying pattern speed with the spiral .",
    "the index @xmath78 , a free parameter , locates the radial bin where the transition between the two patterns occurs .",
    "obviously , the number of available bins constrains the order of the polynomial in a given radial zone .",
    "once we have chosen @xmath61 , we initially choose @xmath68 to reflect comparable amounts of @xmath55 minimization and regularization by letting @xmath79 .",
    "since we are in the business of generating solutions based on particular models , @xmath68 is modified to arrive at the regularization required to return solutions of a given type .",
    "this modification generally consists of an increase in @xmath68 over @xmath80 .",
    "consider how the regularizing parameter @xmath68 regulates the degree of smoothness of the solution to the weight placed on the data : with @xmath68=0 , equation ( [ eq : tichonov ] ) corresponds to @xmath55 minimization ( and becomes an unbiased estimator with the smallest variance ) , however yielding highly oscillatory solutions , while @xmath68@xmath81@xmath82 corresponds to a maximally smooth estimator with non - vanishing variance .",
    "fitting data sets with different spatial coverage will change the effect of @xmath68 on the solution ( e.g. larger bins require less regularization ) . the most appropriate choice for @xmath68 ( and @xmath61 ) should be made on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis , according to the quality of information to be extracted from observations .",
    "by imposing assumptions about the smoothness of the pattern speed , regularization inevitably introduces complications for extracting realistic solutions . to understand how these arise ,",
    "consider the solution for a barred spiral galaxy .",
    "the nature of the calculation ( from out to in ) has implications for the accuracy of the bar estimates , in particular .",
    "not only do the @xmath49 for bins covering the bar rely on the greatest number of matrix elements ( and errors therein ) , but the bar estimate depends critically on the solution for the spiral and all outer bins via equation ( [ eq : outin ] ) .",
    "consequently , merely requiring the pattern speed in the outer bins to be constant with regularization out to the edge of the surface density ( for instance)effectively removing fluctuations that might better fit the data  will have consequences for the bar solutions .",
    "so while the regularization is particularly fast and effective for tests for the radial behavior of patterns , it can also hinder the realization of accurate solutions .    for the simulations studied here",
    ", the risk of regularization - induced bias is inherited from the adopted quadrature .",
    "recall our requirement that all slices cover the full extent of the ` emission'so as to insure all integrals be fully converged  and relatedly , that the last matrix element governs the outermost slice position . in the barred spiral simulation of @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] , for example , such an extensive quadrature presents us with outermost slices that pass through a region where there is simply no discernible pattern ( as indicated by the surface brightness distribution and its fourier decomposition ; see next section ) . while these slices themselves do not provide direct estimates of the patterns of interest , the corresponding bin values are necessary for calculating the bar and spiral solutions .",
    "moreover , the quality of these solutions will be intimately related to the treatment of the outermost bins .",
    "we therefore find that identifying , and reducing the influence of , the compromised zone by not enforcing regularization on these bins to be essential for accurate pattern speed measurement .      with the above concerns in mind , we have tested and used the following scheme .",
    "given slices that pass through an outer region which either contains little information from a strong pattern , is suspected of sustaining multiple patterns , or displays only faint emission , we choose in such a case to let the values in the outermost bins be calculated without regularization with the restriction , only , that they minimize the @xmath55 .",
    "once a particular bin  at @xmath83 , the cut radius  has been reached , regularization is imposed with all remaining inward bins generated accordingly .    in our procedure",
    "this corresponds to using an @xmath61 indexed by the cut bin @xmath84 that is lowest - block zero .",
    "and the ` cut ' radius identifies the location in the disk where the outermost discernible pattern ends .",
    "note that this is in contrast to altogether ignoring the outer portion of the disk .",
    "we prefer this procedure for two reasons : 1 ) as qualified later in @xmath3 [ sec : twtwr ] , when each integral is truncated within the disk , the quadrature is at greater risk of ignoring information critical for characterizing the patterns uniformly throughout the disk and 2 ) like the transition radius @xmath85 , we can easily incorporate @xmath83 as a free , though restricted , parameter in our models .    in practice , extracting the bar and spiral pattern speeds for the simulated barred spiral in @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] involves generating a group of solutions with various bar - to - spiral pattern transition radii for a given ` cut ' location . throughout the analysis",
    ", we choose the cut radius to reflect a priori knowledge of the outermost measurable pattern s termination radius estimated from the surface brightness and its fourier decomposition .",
    "when referred to , the power in each fourier component , or mode @xmath86 , is given by the norm of the complex fourier amplitude @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the angular coordinate of each of the @xmath45 particles at each measured radius .",
    "for the barred spiral in @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] , for example , we combine evidence from the surface density  where beyond the bar there is enhanced spiral surface density from only a limited radial zone  with the fourier spectrum to identify a region in the disk outside the spiral which is susceptible to regularization - induced bias .",
    "specifically , the fourier power spectrum ( figure [ fig - bspowersem ] ) shows that at @xmath53@xmath545.0 the second clean hump in @xmath86=2 power decreases to almost zero , marking the end of the spiral .",
    "past this radius , the ( strong ) @xmath86=2 component ( between @xmath53@xmath546.0 - 8.0 ) is not associated with visible spiral structure ( see figure [ fig - simi ] ) . reckoning this outer zone to be incompatible with a simple pattern speed model , then",
    ", we consider only the inward bar and primary spiral pattern speeds to be measurable with regularization .",
    "figure 19 of @xcite for this simulation ( figure [ fig - d06 ] in this paper ) confirms this ; not only does the spiral pattern terminate at @xmath83@xmath545.0 , but beyond this radius the pattern speed is multi - valued ( this , of course , would be indiscernible in a real galaxy ) . in this case , imposing form with regularization on bins of suspect quality and behavior outside the spiral will likely impair the solution of interest .",
    "we therefore restrict the cut bin for the barred spiral simulation to 4.5@xmath20@xmath83@xmath206.0 , representative of where the primary spiral pattern terminates in the disk .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] , this step is substantiated by our finding that a cut radius of @xmath83=4.8 is one of several @xmath55 minima given a range of possible cut radii . and",
    "furthermore , solutions generated in this manner are judged to overall provide a considerably better fit to the data than solutions where regularization is imposed out to the edge of the surface brightness ( according to the scheme described in the next section ) .",
    "given the data , we simultaneously generate model solutions with different radial dependences for direct comparison for each side ( y@xmath220 or y@xmath200 ) independently .",
    "we then average the two like - model solutions together to construct a global solution .",
    "( in those instances when model solutions include a cut bin , the averaging occurs over the regularized part of the solutions only , in order to maintain the ` unbiased ' quality of the unregularized part of the solutions for each side of the galaxy . )",
    "note that while the assumption that the patterns are indeed global is not overly inspired for the simulated galaxies studied here , putting this into practice on a real galaxy requires that the assumed galaxy kinematic parameters are accurate and that such symmetry exists .    with each global model solution we generate a complete set of @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 using equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) .",
    "we then judge each model through the @xmath89 ( @xmath55 per degree of freedom ) goodness - of - fit estimator of the reproduced to actual @xmath20@xmath21@xmath90 given measurement errors @xmath91 , in keeping with the standard tw analysis .",
    "note that with this choice the @xmath58 in equation ( [ eq : chisq ] ) are related to the errors @xmath91 by @xmath92 .",
    "that is , the calculation fits to the @xmath60 given errors @xmath58 while our @xmath55 estimator considers the differences from @xmath20@xmath21@xmath93 given errors @xmath94 .",
    "while for a real galaxy inaccuracies in the assumed position angle ( pa ) have the largest potential for introducing errors into @xmath20@xmath21@xmath93 , we prefer that the measurement errors @xmath95 reflect random noise in the data , only .",
    "( systematic errors prove more practically assessed through direct tests of the sensitivity of the results to departures from the nominal values for the pa or inclination , for instance . ) for the simulations studied here , then , we obtain errors @xmath91 under the assumption that the inverse mirror image of each @xmath20@xmath21@xmath93 on one side of the galaxy should be the same as on the other side ( i.e. the patterns are symmetric ) . we then assign a global error @xmath95 to each slice where @xmath95=@xmath96/2n ( and @xmath45 is the number of bins / slices used in the twr calculation on a single side ) .    in practice ,",
    "the simplest @xmath97 weighting schemes are either uniform weighting for all slices or weighting by the intensity , which should give more weight to slices where the signal is strongest .",
    "we have chosen the former since we are interested in @xmath1 over a broad radial range , and prefer that our result is not dominated by just the slices with the highest signals ( which can vary dramatically ) .",
    "furthermore , the choice of assigning an identical error @xmath95 to each slice carries with it an implicit weighting scheme for equation ( [ eq : tichonov ] ) .",
    "for an exponential surface brightness profile , for example , slices on either side of the galaxy will have progressively smaller @xmath18 as @xmath98 increases .",
    "this corresponds to errors @xmath58 proportional to @xmath18 , then , that grow larger from out to in . since in most cases the uniform weighting scheme will be in actuality most restrictive of the outer bins  the goodness of which will affect the solution inward  this choice is particularly well suited for the twr calculation",
    ".    given our choice of weighting scheme , there are two important considerations which demand that we calculate the @xmath55 over all slices .",
    "first , the inner - most bins contribute to the @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 in only the inner most slices and hence contribute relatively negligibly to the @xmath55 , despite possibly larger weights @xmath52 ( reflective in part of a surface brightness that is centrally peaked , say ) than bins at larger radius .",
    "this is especially true when an inner pattern appears only over a small fraction of the total bins , and the reproduced @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 of even those slices that pass directly through the inner pattern still rely ( perhaps predominantly ) on the solution out to the largest radial bin .",
    "however , since the goodness of the inner bins is directly related to the goodness of the bins at larger radii , by considering all slices we more effectively judge the whole solution .",
    "secondly , in cases when some number of outermost bins are calculated without regularization , it is critical to account for the ( largely positive ) effect that these bins have on the solution inward , especially from model to model . in our current scheme , the values of the ` unregularized ' bins are not quite identical to those in the completely unregularized solution since the quantity that they minimize still includes participation from non - zero elements in the smoothing functional @xmath61 and what is currently a model - dependent @xmath68 .",
    "that is , slight variation in the values of the ` unregularized ' bins from model to model is apparent , and we can not ignore the minor differences this introduces to the regularized part of the solution . though this is a minor effect , by considering the @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 of all slices in the @xmath55 we prevent solution - preference based on the ` unregularized ' bins ( which act essentially as stand - ins ) from being introduced .",
    "the first consideration above also prevents us from calculating judicious error bars on the solutions according to the variation of individual model parameters over a typical @xmath55 confidence interval ; in practice , the value of an inner pattern with minimal radial extent can change considerably with little effect on the @xmath55 . indeed",
    ", we find that the errors generated according to such a prescription are unrepresentative of the goodness of the solutions as returned by the calculation .    in @xmath3 [ sec : ierror ] , we describe the dependence of both inner and outer speeds on the location assigned to the transition between the two .",
    "an obvious progression for future applications of the twr method would be an exploration of the covariance of what we consider here , to first order , ` free parameters ' , especially for the purposes of improved error estimation .",
    "presently , however , we construct error bars for model solutions by considering the range of parameters in the best solutions at different assumed projections . as will pertain to the sections that follow , by considering an overall solution in this manner we can fairly account for the uncertainty introduced for real galaxies by the reality that each can be sampled at only a single pa .",
    "in order to establish guidelines for applying the regularized calculation to observations of real galaxies , we next perform tests of the method on simulations with known pattern speeds .",
    "each case invokes unique models for @xmath4 which we motivate and discuss in detail .",
    "the procedure for engaging the method with maximum accuracy then follows from careful examination of the quality of solutions given the available information .",
    "though quite detailed , these individual studies together constrain general scenarios and practices to extrapolate onto observations of similarly structured , real galaxies .",
    "we use three simulations in this study .",
    "the first , which we refer to here as simulation i , constitutes a barred galaxy with spiral structure .",
    "originally presented in @xcite ( hereafter d06 ) where it is referred to as run l2.t12 , it consists of a live disk immersed in a rigid halo . a complete description of the model parameters are contained in d06 .",
    "the second ( spiral ) simulation , which we refer to here as simulation ii , is unpublished .",
    "it was designed with the main aim of generating strong spiral structure using the groove mode mechanism of @xcite and @xcite in which dynamical instability develops from a groove , or narrow feature , in the phase - space density at a particular angular momentum",
    ". a trailing spiral wave is generated , and at the lindblad resonances of the wave , further grooves develop such that the instability is recurrent .",
    "like simulation i , it consists of a rigid halo and live disk , but also includes a live bulge component .",
    "the bulge constitutes @xmath99 of the baryonic mass and is sufficiently concentrated that a bar is very slow in forming .",
    "the disk has toomre-@xmath100 ; in order that a strong spiral was seeded , @xmath101 of disk particles in a narrow angular momentum range were removed leaving 4@xmath10210@xmath103 - 169480 particles including the bulge .",
    "the result , as can be seen in figure [ fig - sim2 ] , is the formation of a strong but transient spiral .",
    "the last simulation in this paper , simulation iii , is a double - barred galaxy generated using the method of @xcite .",
    "this high - resolution simulation consists of live disk and bulge components in a rigid halo potential .",
    "the model has @xmath104 million equal mass particles , with @xmath105 million in the disk and @xmath106 million in the bulge such that the bulge has mass @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the disk mass .",
    "the initial toomre-@xmath109 of the disk is @xmath110 .",
    "the formation of the secondary bar is induced by making the bulge rotate ( to mimic a pseudobulge ) .",
    "more details of the simulation can be found in @xcite where it is referred to as run d.    as in d06 , all lengths and velocities are here presented in natural units .",
    "we analyze a snapshot of each simulation at a single time step with the disk in the @xmath111 plane . by rotating the system about the @xmath112 axis",
    "we assign a line - of - sight direction to establish the kinematical major axis .",
    "another rotation about the @xmath9 axis gives the system an inclination @xmath25 ( chosen throughout at @xmath25=45@xmath113 , unless otherwise specified ) .",
    "the snapshot is then projected onto the sky - plane where @xmath30=@xmath9 and @xmath31=@xmath114 . for a given slice spacing ,",
    "the slices along which the calculations occur are aligned perpendicular to the line - of - sight direction ( parallel to the kinematical major axis ) .",
    "the orientation of these slices , which is identical to the disk pa in a real observation , is designated uniquely the slice angle ( sa ) in the studies that follow .      the bar and spiral structure in this simulation , first presented in d06 ,",
    "is featured out to @xmath53@xmath545.0 , clear in the surface density ( figure [ fig - simi ] ) and its fourier decomposition ( figure [ fig - bspowersem ] ) . beyond @xmath53@xmath545.0 ,",
    "the fourier decomposition indicates the possible presence of a third pattern . with step - models for @xmath4 ,",
    "then , we might reasonably extract pattern speeds for three distinct structures .",
    "however , the @xmath86=2 mode between 5.0@xmath20@xmath53@xmath208.0 is not associated with a strong surface density enhancement . and",
    "as remarked upon in @xmath3 [ sec : fourier ] , figure 19 in d06 reproduced here in figure [ fig - d06 ] shows that the pattern in this radial zone is maintained by multiple distinct pattern speeds .",
    "( note that a real galaxy would not be disposed to the analysis provided with this type of plot .",
    "it is available for this simulation , only , and we include it here for the sake of comparison ) . in a clear account of regularization - induced bias , test solutions based on a three - pattern speed model have considerably larger @xmath55 than those parameterizing a bar and single spiral .",
    "we therefore reject models with a third pattern speed and use our ` cut ' scheme where solutions are generated without regularization up to a cut radius @xmath83 which parameterizes the end of the primary spiral pattern .",
    "the actual pattern speeds of the bar and spiral structure to be reproduced by our solutions are @xmath115=0.29 for the bar , and a constant @xmath116=0.18 for the spiral , as estimated from figure [ fig - d06 ] ( from which we also estimate a bar - to - spiral pattern transition radius @xmath53@xmath542.5 ) . in our models of @xmath4",
    ", we express the a priori assumption that the bar pattern speed is constant by using an @xmath61 like that in equation ( [ eq : sdiv ] ) but where , for @xmath77 , @xmath61 is reflective of either a constant , linear , or quadratically varying spiral pattern speed .",
    "solutions with spirals of order 0 , 1 , and 2 , then , have a total of 4 , 5 , and 6 degrees of freedom , respectively . the free parameter @xmath78 we restrict for all models such that 1.8@xmath20@xmath85@xmath203.0 , according to bar - length estimates from figure [ fig - simi ] ( @xmath117@xmath542.2 ) and figure [ fig - bspowersem ] .    for @xmath39=0.3 bins , we require a total of 71 slices ( 35 on each side ) to reach the edge of the surface brightness at @xmath53@xmath5410.5 .",
    "this places the cut bin between 15@xmath20@xmath84@xmath2020 , according to the previously motivated restriction 4.5@xmath20@xmath83@xmath206.0 estimated from figures [ fig - simi ] and [ fig - bspowersem ] .    in light of the discussion in @xmath3 [ sec : weight ] , we construct errors for our estimates to reflect the expected accuracy of twr bar and spiral solutions given a particular observational scenario . specifically , we perform the calculation for a range of sas spanning the upper half - plane of the galaxy ( quadrants i and ii ) , namely @xmath11815@xmath113 , @xmath11845@xmath113 , and @xmath11875@xmath113 .",
    "each sa corresponds to a unique disk pa .",
    "the resultant bar and spiral estimates generated using the @xmath39=0.3 bin width ( to be discussed at length in the following sections ) are listed in table [ tab - bsall ] and the average and rms of the best - fit solutions for this sa range are shown in figure [ fig - bssol ] .",
    "there , horizontal error bars represent the dispersion in @xmath85 and @xmath83 in the solutions based on variations from sa to sa for the @xmath39=0.3 radial bin width .",
    "rewardingly , the best - fit solutions are quite accurate ; the comprehensive spiral and bar estimates in figure [ fig - bssol ] are 6.7% and 8.3% from their actual values ( with @xmath548% error in @xmath115 but a slightly larger error of @xmath5418% in @xmath116 ) .",
    "so , too , are the determinations of @xmath85 and @xmath83 , according to figures [ fig - bspowersem ] and [ fig - d06 ] .",

    "that there is little to no indication of @xmath115=0.29 in the left plot is perhaps not surprising : the large number of bins which accompany the choice of the small bin width would seem to guarantee a high level of noise propagated throughout the solution .",
    "however , in the slightly more stable solution with the wider bin width , the inner bins are still unrepresentative of the actual pattern speed in this zone",
    ". we can understand this as a systematic error introduced by the noise which not only propagates but also compounds as the full solution assembles from the outermost to the innermost radius ; @xmath4 in a given bin reflects errors from all exterior radial bins making the value in that bin more likely far removed from the actual value .",

    "figure [ fig - bssol ] suggests that the twr method should perform well for any given viewing angle .",
    "however , though still quite small , the rms in each estimate is largely reflective of the non - trivial effect that the orientation of the pattern with respect to the slice angle used in the calculation can have on solutions .",
    "we can understand the origin of the differences in solutions for the range of sas in table [ tab - bsall ] by considering the impact of the limited azimuthal range of the bright spiral enhancement ( clear from the surface brightness distribution in figure [ fig - simi ] where the spiral extends almost perpendicular to the bar major axis ) .",
    "that is , at all slice angles the quadrature accumulates fragmentary information from the spiral since only some of the slices that cross the full radial zone of the spiral pattern intersect the strong spiral structure . but whereas both the bar and spiral estimates seem to suffer at sas in quadrant ii ( i.e. positive sas ) , our measurements of @xmath116 in quadrant i are quite accurate . according to the morphology , in quadrant ii it appears that the limited sampling of the spiral asymmetry implicit in slices other than those that also pass through the bar entails slightly less accurate spiral estimation .    to interpret the distinction between solutions from the two quadrants ,",
    "consider the combined influence of regularization and our chosen weighting scheme . specifically , since the regularizing @xmath61 induces the coupling of all bins within the same radial zone , even when the spiral - zone crossing slices do not intersect the strong spiral enhancement , the bins there inherit information from bins at the same radius from slices which do intersect the arms .",
    "according to our weighting scheme , however , this coupling is not uniform ; the degree of support at each azimuth is influenced by the measurement errors for each slice which grow larger from out to in . as a result",
    ", @xmath116 is best constrained by information from slices passing through the outer radial zone of the spiral alone ( not those passing through the bar ) .",
    "so when in quadrant ii the spiral asymmetry appears in only the inner slices , @xmath116 is less precise then when these outer slices clearly intersect the spiral arms .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : outin ] ) , since the bar estimate is directly related to that of the spiral , the result for these sas is error in both @xmath116 and @xmath115 .",
    "the corresponding determination for the radial domain of the bar pattern , on the other hand , is not as obviously sensitive to this issue .",
    "not only is the bar - end reasonably well defined in both quadrants , but information from the bar which contributes to the parameterization of @xmath85 is reinforced with regularization in the manner described above .",
    "the spiral termination radius , too , seems fairly consistent from sa to sa .",
    "but since the asymmetry is weaker ( and there is less information ) at that location in the disk , we find that this parameter requires the most restriction ( indeed , our determinations of @xmath83 completely span the allowed range ) .",
    "overall , then , our determinations for @xmath85 and @xmath83 are stable and accurate , each with less than 11% error , even in quadrant ii .",
    "nevertheless , since the pattern speed estimates from sas in quadrant i seem to comparatively benefit from the high quality of information from both patterns , we conclude that position angles which provide the most uniform slice coverage of all patterns in the disk are preferred .    the largest disparity between step - model solutions from various slice angles can largely be attributed to limitations in determining the location of the transition between the two patterns .",
    "that is , solutions are affected by the finite bin width inherent to the numerical calculation ; slight incompatibility between the actual transition and that to which the solution is limited ( given the bin width ) can result in errors around 10% .",
    "this is a more pervasive effect than morphology alone and more obvious with the use of a slightly larger bin width than @xmath39=0.3 .",
    "nonetheless , we can make several informed inferences about the result of the finite bin width by considering the nature of the twr calculation .",
    "specifically , since the transition determines the contributions of inner and outer patterns to the integral on the right hand side of equations ( [ eq : twint ] ) and ( [ eq : twr ] ) through the matrix elements @xmath52 , a mismatch between the transition bin and the actual transition radius will corrupt the separation of the contributions of the two patterns .",
    "note that this is precisely the source of the covariance between model parameters intimated in @xmath3 [ sec : weight ] .    to understand the effects of ( minor ) radial pattern misassignment ,",
    "consider a step - function solution that parameterizes the extent of a bar pattern speed along with that of a spiral .",
    "when the transition bin between the two patterns underestimates the actual transition by a fraction of the bin width , for instance , we would expect the numerical calculation to effectively subtract off from @xmath60 a contribution from the ( lower ) outer pattern where a higher pattern actually exists ( e.g. eq.[[eq : outin ] ] ) , slightly raising the value of the inner pattern speed .",
    "conversely , we expect an overestimation of the transition to result in a slightly lower inner pattern speed .",
    "more subtle effects can occur , however , depending on the geometry of the patterns , as illustrated for this simulation in @xmath3 [ sec : trans ] .    for a range of sas",
    ", we emphasize that the resultant errors  in possible combination with an undersampled transition  are minimal , as long as the bin size is sufficiently small , and are not the result of vastly different transitions for each sa ; we find that the transition between patterns in the best solutions is generally relatively stable with changes in slice angle .",
    "this may be unexpected from the perspective of the traditional tw method since the projected length presented to the slices by the bar will depend on the relative orientation of the slices with its major axis ( and slice - orientation errors tend to be large , as detailed next for this simulation ) .      in light of the above results ,",
    "we next examine the improvements available to pattern speed estimation using the twr calculation relative to the tw method .",
    "we specifically compare the bar pattern speed estimates arrived at using the twr method with those using fully extended tw integrals .",
    "though tw estimates of @xmath115 in the presence of a secondary structure may also be attempted using truncated integrals that extend to just past the end of the bar ( such that information from the bar alone is dominant ) , we examine the former case for two reasons : 1 ) to compare the two methods under identical conditions ( i.e. using the same data points @xmath20@xmath21@xmath93 ) and 2 ) to study the influence of the relatively weak spiral ( and evaluate the assumption of negligible non - axisymmetric motions beyond the bar ) .",

    "this aspect of the calculation allows for the return of pattern speed solutions without reference to an assumed pattern extent , and provides , moreover , an independent means of determining the radial domain of patterns .",
    "of course , this is not to imply that a deficiency of usable slices in tw estimates prevents accurate pattern speed measurement , or determination of pattern extent , for that matter ; using slices that cross primarily through the enhanced emission from the bar , tw estimates from sb0 galaxies have been successfully used to observationally confirm that bars end at or inside their corotation radii .",
    "however , it does suggest that in the presence of non - negligible asymmetry exterior to the bar , tw bar estimates are susceptible to errors introduced by the use of slices positioned near the bar end which are presumed to reflect the bar pattern speed but in reality include a significant contribution from this structure . consider a typical plot of @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 vs. @xmath20@xmath9@xmath22 for bar - crossing slices .",

    "( see @xcite where studies with a simulated sb0 include a number of slices sampling the full extent of the bar . )",
    "but when there is considerable asymmetric structure present beyond the end of the bar , similarly positioned slices will reflect this contribution , impairing measurement of the true bar pattern speed .    in the barred spiral simulation",

    "indeed , past @xmath126@xmath543.2 where @xmath20@xmath9@xmath22 crosses zero we can infer that this bar - crossing slice contains substantial participation from the spiral ; both @xmath20@xmath9@xmath22 and @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 decrease to a dip between @xmath126=4.0 and 6.0 before reaching a plateau .",
    "this is evidence that , despite the relative weakness and limited extent of the spiral as indicated by the surface brightness distribution , the asymmetry in the disk should not be considered dominated by the bar alone .",
    "moreover , this is a clear indication that the twr calculation , which identifies and effectively removes the spiral contribution from the fully extended @xmath127-weighted velocity integrals , can improve upon traditional tw bar estimates that also use fully extended integrals .",
    "of course , as displayed by figure [ fig - integrals75b ] , integrating only between @xmath128@xmath54 2.5 may alone provide a reasonable bar pattern speed and relieve all other tw slices from the spiral contribution .",
    "however , this would provide only a single pattern speed estimate where two are possible ; using the twr method and fully extended integrals , both @xmath115 _ and _ @xmath116 can be measured .",
    "figure [ fig - integrals75b ] also raises a crucial point related to the required limit of integration along each slice in the twr calculation : if there is a clear plateau in the integrals reached before the edge of the map boundary , why not simply truncate the integrals where they have converged ( common to tw estimates ) rather than use integrals extending to the edge of the surface brightness and which present outermost bins that we demand must be ` cut ' ( that is , calculated without regularization ) , anyway ?",
    "the plateau reached at @xmath126@xmath548.0 would suggest that truncating the integral there could suitably account for information from the major sources of asymmetry in the disk .",
    "however , this same distinction is not clearly shared by all slices , especially those at large @xmath121 .",
    "if we associate the plateau in this slice at @xmath10=1.2 with the limit of integration @xmath125=8.2 and hence the total radial extent @xmath129 required of the quadrature where @xmath130 , then this locates the outermost slice position at @xmath131=@xmath132 as well as the extent of the integral along this slice .",
    "it is easy to check that ( at least for this slice orientation ) the integral has not achieved convergence by this point , nor have most other integrals in the disk by @xmath129 .    rather than risk ignoring information critical for characterizing the patterns uniformly throughout the disk , then , we choose to include in the quadrature all information out to the edge of the surface density .",
    "indeed , this serves to perform a function similar to truncating tw integrals .",
    "the difference in the two procedures arises from the fact that while the limits of integration for each individual slice can be adjusted for a given structure of interest in the tw calculation , the quadrature in the twr method delineates specific bounds which must encompass complete information from all extended patterns in the disk .      in this section",
    "we use the barred spiral simulation to consider the errors introduced to twr pattern speed estimates in real galaxies .",

    ", we test the aptitude of the twr method in measuring a radially varying spiral pattern speed that subsists over a large radial zone . since the strong spiral surface density enhancement in this simulation ( figure [ fig - sim2 ] ) has only moderate azimuthal range like the spiral in @xmath3 [ sec : sim1 ] , we further explore the likely limitations intrinsic to detecting spiral nonaxisymmetry with a given slice orientation .",
    "the two - armed spiral featured in this simulation extends over a large portion of the disk and is strong both in the surface brightness distribution ( figure [ fig - sim2 ] ) and as traced by departures from axisymmetric rotation ( streaming motions ) in the velocity field ( figure [ fig - sim2vel ] ) .",
    "we estimate the extent of the spiral structure from that of the dominant @xmath86=2 component in the fourier power spectrum plotted in figure [ fig - pplot30s ] . with the expectation , then , that the spiral structure exists between 0.5@xmath153@xmath53@xmath1533.5 , we restrict our spiral pattern speed solutions to the radial zone @xmath85@xmath20@xmath53@xmath20@xmath83 bordered at the innermost and outermost radii by two independent sets of unregularized bins .",

    "the vertical error bars on bins at large and small @xmath53 similarly reflect variations in the location of @xmath83 and @xmath85 with sa . principally , the solution suffers contamination from bins that perhaps yet contain information from the inner or outer axisymmetric zones .",
    "but we also find that solutions in quadrant ii tend to decrease from @xmath154 to a value @xmath83 that is further in by about 10% than for solutions using slices at the perpendicular orientation .",
    "nevertheless , we find the average @xmath85=0.8@xmath1180.2 and @xmath83=3.2@xmath1180.3 to be in agreement with the bounds of the spiral pattern indicated by the disk surface density and its fourier decomposition .    despite these pa - dependent effects , the values implied by the average solution ( @xmath154 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 )",
    "are accurate to within 5% , 11% and 10% , respectively . that we have correctly reproduced the high - order variation of @xmath4 ,",
    "regardless of sa , however , is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the twr solutions , even though the detectable variation is only at the 30% level .",
    "naturally , our solution for @xmath4 lends itself to pattern winding time estimates . with the average values for the maximum and minima implied by our solution we can estimate the winding time of the pattern according to @xmath158 for the outer spiral arm , for example",
    ", we estimate an average time to wind @xmath159= 71.64 which is less than 10% from the actual winding time @xmath160=78.53 observed from the time evolution of the simulation .",
    "( this , of course , assumes that @xmath4 does not vary over this time . )    as this simulation would indicate , even without uniform slice coverage , though it may be slightly more difficult to determine with confidence the radial domain of the pattern ( given large errors in @xmath85 and @xmath83 ) , the overall shape , or functional form , for @xmath4 can be ascertained .",
    "of course , this is largely influenced by the adopted measurement errors @xmath95 for each slice and the quality of a priori information that can be gathered and employed . with larger errors @xmath95 , for instance , the @xmath55 criterion becomes less discriminating , and it may be difficult to distinguish between several different radial dependences for @xmath4 . additionally , without clear evidence that limits where the spiral pattern terminates , we risk misidentifying intrinsic radial variation .",
    "indeed , if we restrict @xmath83 to less than that implied by the best - fit solutions  and search instead for solutions at a second @xmath83-@xmath161 minimum  the pattern speed solutions for all six sas are constant between @xmath162@xmath540.47 and @xmath163@xmath542.47 . as may be expected , the average value for this constant pattern speed @xmath1=0.236@xmath1180.051 is similar to that suggested by traditional tw estimates where @xmath164=0.207@xmath1180.046 on average .      in this section",
    "we address the use of the twr method for the purposes of nuclear bar detection and measurement using the double barred sb0 simulation pictured in figure [ fig - simiii ] . in performing the regularized twr calculation",
    "we again act under the assumption of multiple patterns in distinct radial zones .",
    "our models for @xmath4 parameterize unique , constant pattern speeds for both the primary and secondary bars , known to have pattern speeds of @xmath165=0.23 and @xmath166=0.41 , respectively . from inspection of the surface density and its fourier decomposition ( for which the power spectrum is plotted in figure [ fig-2bpower ] ) , we associate the drop in power of the @xmath86=2 component at @xmath53@xmath540.8 and again at @xmath53@xmath543.0 with the end of each bar . in step - models for @xmath4 ,",
    "then , we restrict the secondary - to - primary bar and primary bar - to - disk transitions to within 0.4@xmath20@xmath167@xmath201.2 and 2.5@xmath20@xmath168@xmath203.2 , respectively .    to isolate the bars from the rest of the disk we extend the quadrature to the edge of the surface density and employ our ` cut ' procedure in light of the argument set forth at the end of @xmath3 [ sec : twtwr ] .",
    "this is particularly compelling here since , despite the apparent axisymmetry beyond the primary bar in this sb0 simulation , the fourier decomposition shows power in the @xmath86=2 mode beyond @xmath53@xmath543.0 , especially in the last third of the disk .",
    "if the asymmetry in this radial zone ( which appears only very weakly in the surface density ) is sustained by an ill - defined , non - unique or perhaps unrigid pattern  for which the tw / twr assumptions break - down  then associating it with a measurable pattern speed will likely introduce regularization - induced bias to the solution for the interior patterns of interest .",
    "critically , asymmetry such as this may prevent clear integral convergence beyond the primary bar end .",
    "so , too , can its presence in the integrals be expected to degrade the reliability of pattern speed estimates for the structures of interest .",
    "removing the influence of the information in this outer radial zone by calculating the bins there without regularization is our best chance for accurate pattern speed measurement . given that the departure from axisymmetry manifest by a small nuclear bar will be relatively minor compared with that of other patterns in the disk , this is especially relevant for accurate measurement of @xmath116 .",
    "in this case , non - axisymmetry on a comparable scale may easily upset this structure s contribution to the integrals and , if prescribed an incorrect pattern speed model , may introduce consequences for the inner most bins in solutions .    our procedure for this simulation , however , does not quite involve calculating without regularization all bins up to the patterns of interest ( i.e. to the end of the primary bar ) .",
    "as in all cases , but particularly here where we are compelled to ` cut ' approximately two thirds of the disk , leaving a large portion of the total bins unregularized may begin to reintroduce unamendable propagating noise . to reduce this risk , careful attention has been paid to the development and testing of models which prevent the destabilization of solutions .",
    "( indeed , the appropriate balance between noise and stability in models for @xmath4 must be explored on a galaxy by galaxy basis . ) here , we find that the most stable and realistic models for @xmath4 are those which include a third , constant pattern past the end of the primary bar . from this we might infer that , though weak and difficult to discern in figure [ fig - simiii ] , there exists a spiral pattern outside the primary bar , perhaps corresponding to the @xmath86=2 component beyond @xmath53@xmath543.0 which remains clear , though modest out to @xmath53@xmath545.0 .",
    "indeed , we assume that the third minimum in the power of the @xmath86=2 component at this radius corresponds to the end of the spiral pattern , and moreover , since counts are low in the rest of the disk , that the bins beyond @xmath53@xmath545.0 are best calculated without regularization .",
    "we note , however , that we do not necessarily expect to measure a realistic pattern speed in this third radial zone .    compiling this evidence for two bars and a possible spiral we search for the best - fit solutions parameterizing two constant pattern speeds ( one for the primary bar , one for the inner secondary bar ) out to the end of the primary bar , in addition to a third constant pattern speed @xmath116 restricted to extend out to 4.3@xmath20@xmath83@xmath205.3 .",
    "we find that solutions generated in this manner provide much more accurate estimates for the primary and secondary bars compared with solutions that are either regularized over the full extent of the surface density or unregularized up to the end of the primary bar .    for the purposes of further establishing favorable conditions for nuclear bar detection",
    ", we adopt a small bin width @xmath39=0.15 in the quadrature . as described in @xmath3 [ sec : ierror ] and @xmath3 [ sec : trans ] , the mismatch by a fraction of a bin width or more between the actual transition and that to which the solution is confined can have consequences for both inner and outer twr pattern speed estimates .",
    "real nuclear bars will need to be well resolved in order to accurately separate the contributions of the two bars .",
    "the secondary bar in this simulation is known to be non - rigidly rotating ; in @xcite and in @xcite , the amplitudes and pattern speeds of secondary bars formed in purely collisionless @xmath45-body simulations through the introduction of a rotating pseudobulge oscillate as the bars rotate through the companions in which they are nested . in @xcite , tw estimates of the secondary bar pattern speed measured using bulge - only kinematics ( the bulge supports the nuclear bar alone and a primary bar contribution need not be accounted for in the tw integrals ) are subject to marked errors consistent with an origin in non - rigid rotation .",
    "these errors result in estimates of @xmath166 too high on one side of the galaxy and too low on the other , in accord with being a manifestation of the oscillations driving radial pulsations which contribute with different signs on the two sides of the galaxy .",

    "these solutions are much more stable and accurate ; at less than 8% from their actual values , the comprehensive primary and secondary bar pattern speeds evidently benefit from the integrity of the calculated transitions between patterns ( we find @xmath167=0.75@xmath1180.09 , @xmath168=3.0@xmath1180.21 , and @xmath83=4.6@xmath1180.33 ) .",

    "the comparative worth of twr solutions can be deduced in light of the distinction between the traditional tw and the twr methods .",
    "our twr pattern speed measurement for the primary bar is comparable to that from the traditional tw calculation ; using slices covering @xmath1702.25 ( such that the bar contribution is maximal in all slices ) , the tw method returns @xmath171=0.214@xmath1180.011 . the twr secondary bar estimate , on the other hand , greatly improves upon the tw estimate @xmath172=0.338@xmath1180.149 available using slices covering @xmath1700.6 .",
    "since the nuclear bar appears in only a very small number of slices and its contribution is , moreover , easily overwhelmed in the extended tw integrals , the tw method only modestly recovers @xmath166 . in the twr calculation , however , the few bins that cover the nuclear bar are supplied with large weights @xmath52 compared with the rest of the information along each slice .",
    "together with a suitable bin width , this effectively isolates information from throughout the nuclear bar extent from that of all other patterns in the disk .",
    "the quality with which @xmath166 can be constrained then depends on how well the contribution from these other patterns is identified and removed from slices intersecting the nuclear bar , and moreover relies on regularization over both sides of the galaxy to construct a global solution .    aside from the unavoidable error introduced by the non - rigid rotation of nuclear bars expected from n - body simulations , from our current study it seems likely that similar calculations may be limited according to the degree of resolution and the relative size of the secondary bar .",
    "that is , the former dictates the precision with which the secondary - to - primary bar transition can be determined , and the latter sets the leverage supplied by the secondary bar to the @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , given that the measurement of an inner , nuclear bar pattern speed is subsequently largely affected by how well the other patterns present in the disk can be measured , success with the twr method requires appropriate models for @xmath4 that account for such concerns .",
    "the successes of the twr method as applied to simulated data should be obtainable with real galaxies , provided that adequate attention is paid to several considerations .",
    "since the calculation foremost requires integration along slices parallel to the galaxy major axis which reflect information from all patterns of interest in the disk , observations must be able to present a number of these .",
    "as governed by the resolution or sampling of the data , the placement of these slices must be able to define a quadrature wherein the position @xmath10 of the outermost slice corresponds to that of the last matrix element along the slice requiring the largest limit of integration @xmath125 for integral convergence ; when convergence can be reached only clearly at the map boundary ( perhaps far beyond the extent of the patterns ) , this is essential for correctly accounting for all information along each slice .",
    "establishing the slice positions and orientation for an accurate quadrature also clearly requires superior knowledge of kinematic and morphological parameters . in general , the same restrictions to the quality of input data in traditional tw calculations",
    "apply to the twr method .",
    "as described in @xmath3 [ sec : err ] , errors in the assumed pa which impair tw estimates can also introduce considerable inaccuracy to the twr solutions .",
    "the inclination angle of the disk must also be well - determined and should be preferably restricted to only moderate values ( which , beyond the observational requirements of the tw method , will keep errors from corrupting the association of information into accurate radial bins ) .    additionally ,",
    "though more easily overcome in traditional tw estimates @xcite , errors in the systemic velocity and galaxy center might prove critical for the twr solutions since each side of the disk provides an independent solution for @xmath4 .",
    "care must be taken not to impair the prevailing symmetry along each slice , given that each integral bears more than one estimate .",
    "the incorrect placement of radial bins according to a mis - assigned galaxy center position , for example , could significantly over- or under - estimate the actual pattern speed , and moreover make assessment of the true radial variation unlikely .",
    "the regularization procedure developed here itself makes further demands on the quality and amount of information necessary to perform the calculation .",
    "but by keeping the amount of information beyond that required of the tw method to a minimum , and using standard diagnostics such as fourier decomposition , the requisite set of a priori assumptions can be invoked quite reliably .",
    "as long the information is accessible , requiring at the least theoretical motivation to develop testable models , and limited in principle only by the quality of information from which it is to be gathered , then the regularization should proceed without impediment .    of course ,",
    "unlike the simulated galaxies studied here where there is plenty of signal throughout the disk , observations of real galaxies may present sensitivity issues . while regions of low signal - to - noise in the outer disk can be superseded using the ` cut ' procedure developed here",
    ", high quality information from the rest of the disk is an obvious priority for the method ; the departures from axisymmetry induced by all patterns present in the disk must be clearly detectable .",
    "not only does the calculation depend on the presence ( or lack ) of these signatures  in both the surface density and in the velocity field  but the mere identification of the number and domain of patterns is critical for developing appropriate models for @xmath4 .",
    "this latter necessity may be hard met since , for instance , it will be rare to observe galaxies with surface densities that can be fourier - decomposed as cleanly as is possible with simulated galaxies .",
    "furthermore , unlike simulations , it is impossible to establish whether or not there exists more than a single pattern speed at each measured radius in real galaxies . since the models developed with regularization here are incompatible with non - unique pattern speeds , for real galaxies , the choice of when and where to consider a transition or to keep solutions unregularized may be based on a more qualitative assessment of where clear structure ends .",
    "inevitably , the combination of the above considerations ( related , overall , to the quality of the data ) will determine the extent to which the model for the true radial behavior of @xmath4 can be differentiated from other models .",
    "that is , the @xmath55 criterion with which we judge the goodness of solutions becomes less discriminating the larger the measurement error @xmath95 . since the adopted measurement error @xmath95 for each slice used in the calculation and in the @xmath55 estimator must necessarily incorporate observational errors based on random noise in the data , with severe enough errors different model solutions from real , imperfect data may be indistinguishable .",
    "in addition , systematic errors ( likely dominated by pa uncertainty ) will undeniably challenge the accuracy of solutions . in all applications of the method",
    "it is critical to assess the influence of these errors through direct tests of the sensitivity of solutions to departures from the nominal values of pa , inclination , and kinematic center , for instance .",
    "clearly , this makes 2-d coverage desirable ; here , 2 - 3@xmath113 uncertainties in the pa alone are shown to introduce around 15% error in measurements of @xmath4 for the barred spiral simulation",
    ".    insufficient resolution or sampling may also impair twr solutions from real galaxies .",
    "a large adopted bin width not only limits the detectable radial variation in @xmath4 , but also restricts how well multiple patterns can be separated in the resultant quadrature ; a mismatch between the actual transition and that to which the solution is confined can have consequences for the estimates of both inner and outer patterns .",
    "naturally , depending on the models to be tested and relative size of the disk , a resolution - constrained bin width is not guaranteed to impair solutions for all galaxies .",
    "we nonetheless foresee that the only true way to preserve the integrity of solutions is with high - resolution observations .",
    "data cubes lend themselves well to analysis with the twr method , since unlike long - slit spectroscopic observations , the galaxy pa , inclination , systemic velocity and ( kinematic ) center can be derived with errors from the data using a tilted - ring analysis on the first moment of the cube .",
    "additionally , multiple slices can be defined with a single observation .",
    "so between radio and sub - mm investigations of spiral structure , for instance , and ifu spectroscopy with which double bar systems ( and eventually double barred spirals , given larger , more sensitive ifus ) can be studied , applications of the twr method could be extensive .    of course , like all applications of the tw method , the observed tracer",
    "must be found to obey continuity and",
    "the relation between the intensity of the tracer and the surface density must be linear or well - determined everywhere . reviews of several possible tracers argued to suitably obey the tw continuity requirement can be found throughout the literature , but we note here that the work of @xcite studying the effect of dust on tw measurements of bars may find meaningful extension in future twr studies of multiple patterns in late - type galaxies .",
    "there , model dust lane features associated with bars introduce errors on the order of 20 - 40% @xcite .",
    "in addition to these errors , twr solutions could possibly be prone to increased error from spiral dust lanes at larger radii . though it is beyond the scope of this work to make a detailed assessment of the sensitivity of twr solutions to dust",
    ", we argue that such noise could well be mitigated through the use of regularization , and expect no greater an effect in twr measurements than tw , which moreover , will be apparent with the use of only optical tracers .    in the immediate future",
    ", we plan to apply the twr method to several high - resolution bima song co observations of molecule dominated galaxies to search for spiral winding , relations between bar and spiral pattern speeds , and spiral - spiral mode coupling .",
    "( these observations include single - dish data and therefore do not suffer from missing flux which would be a violation of the continuity requirement . ) for those galaxies with isms not dominated by molecular gas , we plan to combine the co with hi data to make total column density maps ( assuming the ionized component is negligible ) .",
    "since the co - h@xmath173 conversion factor is critical in combining the co and hi maps ( and , of course , in establishing molecule dominance in the former case ) , it will be necessary to test the sensitivity of the twr method to the adopted conversion factor for such combinations .",
    "additionally , since warped disks ( common in hi ) are a violation of the tw assumptions , we will also perform tests to determine if our cut - off scheme can be used to circumvent the warp and thereby extract solutions from the rest of the disk . for these applications of the twr method",
    ", we plan to construct measurement errors @xmath120 for each slice that reflect uncertainties related to the flux cutoff chosen in creating the moment maps .",
    "the effect of pa and other systematic errors will be assessed by testing the sensitivity of solutions to departures from the nominal values .",
    "although in the interest of testing our strategy for each simulated galaxy is somewhat tailored to its unique properties , with the above caveats in mind our studies have enabled us to develop a general and reasonably objective prescription for applying the regularized twr calculation :    1 .   establish the bin width and the corresponding number of slices ( not necessarily uniformly spaced ) that are required to achieve converged integrals using an @xmath38 quadrature . for the purposes of measuring multiple patterns in a single disk , this will likely extend to the map boundary .",
    "2 .   compile a priori information by inspecting the surface density , its fourier decomposition , and the velocity field for indications of patterns and to establish the expected number and domain of measurable pattern speeds .",
    "this should include the identification of regions in the disk susceptible to regularization - induced bias .",
    "3 .   develop theoretically and/or observationally motivated models which parameterize @xmath4 according to the a priori information .",
    "4 .   incorporate measurement errors into a single @xmath95 ( and @xmath120 ) for each slice .",
    "these should represent uncertainties in the adopted intensity noise level , and/or other random noise - related errors ; systematic errors are preferably determined through direct testing ( see item 9 ) .",
    "develop the weighting scheme for a reduced @xmath55 estimator which accounts for the total degrees of freedom for the models to be tested .",
    "this should reflect expectations for which slices , if any , are most critically to be reproduced by the models .",
    "generate preliminary solutions for the models . at this point , the degree of regularization required to return solutions according to type should be explored .",
    "7 .   with finalized solutions , use equation ( [ eq : twr ] ) to generate a complete set of @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 for each and calculate the corresponding @xmath174 .",
    "use the @xmath174 to identify the best - fit solution .",
    "test the sensitivity of the results to other systematic effects peculiar to the observation , e.g. adopted pa and/or the co - h@xmath173 conversion factor , for instance .",
    "in this paper we have shown that regularizing the twr calculation is an effective means of smoothing intrinsically noisy solutions for more precise measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , ( barring a large , limiting resolution ) regularization admits the use of a much smaller bin width than that required to achieve comparable smoothness in the unregularized calculation .",
    "this affords improved assessment of radial variation as well as more accurate determination of the transitions between multiple pattern speeds ( and thus of the values of the pattern speeds themselves , in principle ) .",
    "moreover , with the regularized twr calculation , different theoretically and observationally motivated models for the radial dependence of @xmath4 can be tested in fairly short time and with only the minor addition of information compared to the unregularized twr and tw methods .    with a simple scheme for generating @xmath71 order polynomial solutions which can be incorporated into step models",
    ", we have shown that the twr method can be used to parameterize the radial domains of multiple pattern speeds . together with a priori information identifying zones in the disk which may be incompatible with measurement ( either because they are characterized by low signal - to - noise or show no evidence for a pattern )",
    ", we can further constrain the extent of patterns while optimally reducing regularization - induced bias in pattern speed solutions .    as applied to three simulated galaxies ,",
    "we find that the twr method developed in this manner performs with a high degree of accuracy ( with less than 15% error ) both in measurement and in extracting information about the true functional form for the pattern speed . tests on a simulation of a barred spiral galaxy indicate that not only can the constant pattern speed for a relatively weak spiral be reliably reproduced , but information about both the pattern speed and the radial extent of the bar pattern can also be extracted .",
    "( indeed , we find that the bar pattern speed estimate is strengthened by the proper use of information from beyond the bar end . ) and though the bar pattern speed estimates is highly susceptible to systematic errors  with pa errors introducing the largest uncertainty to twr pattern speeds , as with tw estimates  we find that the identification of the transition between the two is relatively stable .",
    "the twr method can also be effectively employed to measure patterns that are winding in nature . in a simulation of a two - armed spiral",
    ", the best - fit twr solutions from several slice orientations correctly reproduce the high - order radial variation of the pattern speed , despite modest indication that not all orientations supply the same authority ( this , of course , would seem to depend on the morphology of this spiral , in particular ) . indeed , though the twr method can , in principle , handle any ( presumably random ) alignment of patterns , in all of the simulations studied , slice orientations which provide the most uniform coverage of the patterns are preferred .",
    "this is of particular importance for nuclear bar pattern speed measurement , as found in tests of the method on a double barred simulation . since the innermost bins which provide the foremost leverage on the nuclear bar are also the most susceptible to errors from throughout the disk , confident measurement requires all other patterns to be well constrained .",
    "in principle , comparable accuracy should be achievable on real galaxies .",
    "however , these tests do not constrain how well the twr method can perform under severe observational limitations which may commonly arise . not only can determinations of the pa , inclination , and dynamical center be subject to considerable errors given low - quality data , but identifying constraints on the patterns present in the disk to be incorporated into models for @xmath4 could prove challenging . additionally , though regularization can reduce the impact of noise on solutions , large measurement errors for each slice could make discriminating between several possible models for @xmath4 difficult . and",
    "most critically , since the nature of the numerical calculation relies on a relatively small bin width to achieve its greatest accuracy , without high resolution , some observations may not afford practical solutions .",
    "nevertheless , if restricted to high resolution observations with adequate sensitivity , and given radially stable kinematic parameters , twr solutions can be used to study the connection between multiple patterns and the nature of spiral winding .",
    "so , too , can we expect progressively more satisfactory applications of the method ; though the number of galaxies to which the method can be successfully applied is limited by the current generation of instruments , in the future , larger ifus , alma , and eventually , ska should yield much higher quality data with larger areal coverage and higher angular resolution .",
    "this prospect in itself should warrant future studies with the twr method .",
