    "semiconductor spintronics , which aims at utilizing or incorporating the spin degree of freedom in electronics , has attracted much interest.@xcite during the last decade , the fast developments of techniques of coherent manipulation of electron spins via optical or electrical methods@xcite have intrigued a lot of studies.@xcite many of the important findings are developed in bulk gaas or gaas epilayers , where the spin relaxation time ( srt ) was found to be as long as 130  ns,@xcite and the spin diffusion length was reported as large as 100  @xmath2m.@xcite remarkably , it has been found that the srt can vary by more than three orders of magnitude with temperature or electron density.@xcite the relevant spin relaxation mechanisms for electron system in the metallic regime have been recognized for a long time as : ( i ) the elliot - yafet ( ey ) mechanism in which electron spins have a small chance to flip during each scattering due to spin mixing in the conduction band;@xcite ( ii ) the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism in which the electron spins decay due to their precession around the * k*-dependent spin - orbit fields ( inhomogeneous broadening@xcite ) during the free flight between adjacent scattering events;@xcite ( iii ) the bir - aronov - pikus ( bap ) mechanism in which electrons exchange their spins with holes.@xcite the hyperfine interaction is another mechanism which is usually important for spin relaxation of localized electrons and ineffective in metallic regime where most of the carriers are in extended states.@xcite    despite decades of study , a detailed theoretical investigation from a fully microscopic approach in bulk system has not yet been performed . although song and kim have investigated electron spin relaxation due to all the three relevant mechanisms for various conditions in both @xmath0- and @xmath1-type semiconductors,@xcite in their work they use the analytical expressions based on single - particle approach which are only applicable for the non - degenerate electron system , and hence make the discussion in low temperature and/or high density regime questionable .",
    "more importantly , the carrier - carrier coulomb scattering , which has been shown to be very important for spin relaxation in two - dimensional systems,@xcite has not yet been well studied in bulk system .",
    "also , at finite spin polarization , the coulomb hartree - fock ( hf ) term acts as an effective longitudinal magnetic field , which has been demonstrated to be able to increase the srt by more than one order of magnitude when the initial spin polarization is high in two - dimensional electron system ( 2des).@xcite however , the effect of the coulomb hf term in bulk system has not been investigated .",
    "another issue is that the commonly used analytical formula for spin relaxation due to the bap mechanism is based on the elastic scattering approximation , which has been proved to be invalid for low temperature due to pretermission of the pauli blocking of electrons very recently by zhou and wu.@xcite consequently , the bap mechanism has been demonstrated to be unimportant in two - dimensional system at moderate and high excitation density first theoretically@xcite and then experimentally,@xcite which is in stark contrast with the common belief in the literature . whether it is still true in bulk system remains unchecked .",
    "furthermore , in most works only the short - range electron - hole exchange interaction was considered , while the long - range part was ignored.@xcite all these questions suggest that a detailed fully microscopic investigation is needed . in this work ,",
    "we perform such a study from the fully microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach.@xcite we focus on the metallic regime where most of the carriers are in extended states .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the zero magnetic field case.@xcite    previously , the ksbe approach has been applied extensively to study spin dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures in both markovian and non - markovian limits and in systems both near and far away from the equilibrium ( under strong static or terahertz electric field or with high spin polarization).@xcite the ksbe approach has been demonstrated to be successful in the study of spin relaxation in semiconductor quantum wells where good agreements with experiments have been achieved and many predictions have been confirmed by experiments.@xcite this approach has also been applied in the investigation of spin relaxation / dephasing in bulk gaas many years ago by wu and ning , where only the electron  nonmagnetic - impurity and electron - phonon scatterings are included.@xcite in this work , we include all the scatterings , especially the electron - electron coulomb , electron - hole coulomb , and electron - hole exchange scatterings together with the ey mechanism which were not considered in ref .  .",
    "an important goal of this work is to find the dominant mechanism in different parameter regimes and for different materials from the fully microscopic ksbe approach .",
    "previous investigations in the literature indicate that for @xmath0-type iii - v semiconductors , the spin relaxation is mostly dominated by the dp mechanism , except at low temperature where the ey mechanism is most important ; for intrinsic and @xmath1-type iii - v semiconductors , the bap mechanism dominates at low temperature when the hole density is high , whereas the dp mechanism dominates in other regimes.@xcite in the present work , from the fully microscopic ksbe approach , however , we find that the ey mechanism is less important than the dp mechanism in @xmath0-type iii - v semiconductors even for narrow band - gap semiconductors , such as inas and insb . for @xmath1-type iii - v semiconductors ,",
    "we find that the bap mechanism dominates spin relaxation in the low temperature regime only when the photo - excitation density is low enough . however , when the photo - excitation density is high , the bap mechanism can be comparable with the dp mechanism only in the moderate temperature regime roughly around the fermi temperature of electrons , and for higher or lower temperature it is unimportant .",
    "the relative importance of the bap mechanism decreases with the photo - excitation density and eventually becomes negligible for sufficiently high photo - excitation density . for intrinsic iii - v semiconductors ,",
    "the bap mechanism is negligible .",
    "an important method of spin injection is the hot - electron spin injection where high electric field is applied.@xcite moreover , in 2des , the spin relaxation can be effectively manipulated by the high in - plane electric field.@xcite in this work , we also study spin relaxation in @xmath0-type bulk semiconductors under high electric field .",
    "we show that there is some essential difference of the electric field effect on spin dynamics between 2des and the bulk system . using gaas as an example",
    ", we demonstrate that the electric field dependence of spin lifetime can be nonmonotonic or monotonic depending on the lattice temperature and the densities of impurities and electrons .",
    "the underlying physics is analyzed .",
    "the results indicate that the spin lifetime can be effectively controlled by electric field .",

    "in this work , we reexamine the problem from the fully microscopic ksbe approach .",
    "let us first examine the case of insb .",
    "insb is a narrow band - gap semiconductor where the spin relaxation is believed to be dominated by the ey mechanism at low temperature previously.@xcite the factor @xmath102 is much smaller than that of gaas , which indicates the importance of the ey mechanism according to eq .",
    "( [ eydp2 ] ) ( a list of the factor @xmath102 for different materials is given in table ii ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eyinsb](a ) , we plot the ratio of the srt due to the ey mechanism , @xmath103 , to that due to the dp mechanism , @xmath104 , calculated from the ksbes , as function of temperature for various electron densities . in the calculation , @xmath105 .",
    "remarkably , it is noted that the ratio @xmath106 is always larger than 1 , and in most cases it is even larger than 10 , i.e. , the spin relaxation in @xmath0-type insb is _ not _ dominated by the ey mechanism .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence is not monotonic , which is different from the intuition given by eq .",
    "( [ eydp2 ] ) . this can be understood as following : the increase of the ratio comes from the increase of @xmath107 which is understood easily .",
    "the decrease of the ratio comes from the decrease of @xmath108 due to the increase of the electron  lo - phonon scattering with temperature which becomes important for @xmath109  k in insb .",
    "therefore , after a crossover regime , the ratio eventually decreases with temperature .",
    "moreover , for large electron density @xmath110  @xmath111 , the electron system is in the degenerate regime and @xmath107 changes slowly with temperature which further facilitates the decrease of the ratio . to elucidate it clearly",
    ", we plot the srt due to the ey mechanism and dp mechanism in fig .",
    "[ fig : eyinsb](b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eyinsb](b ) that the srt due to the ey mechanism always decreases with temperature due to both the increase of @xmath107 and the enhancement of the scattering . from fig .",
    "[ fig : eyinsb](c ) , it is further noted that the temperature dependence of the srt due to the dp mechanism is , however , different for low density and high density regimes : in low density regime , the srt decreases with the temperature , whereas in high density regime it increases .",
    "the decreases of srt with temperature at low density is consistent with previous studies in the literature.@xcite the increases of srt with temperature at high density , however , is because that the electron  lo - phonon scattering increases with temperature faster than the inhomogeneous broadening @xmath112 in the degenerate regime .",
    "note that the increase of the srt with temperature at such high temperature ( @xmath113  k ) without any magnetic field has neither been observed in experiment nor been predicted in theory .",
    "note that the results for high density cases are only given at high temperatures due to the limitation of our computation power .",
    "however , according to the above analysis , the ratio in the low temperature regime should be larger than its value at 300  k for high density cases . for low density cases with temperature lower than our calculation range , both the momentum scattering and the inhomogeneous broadening change little with temperature as the electron system is degenerate .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath106 changes slowly .",
    "consequently , it does not change the conclusion that the ey mechanism is less efficient than the dp mechanism in @xmath0-type insb.@xcite in contrast , based on eq .",
    "( [ eydp2 ] ) , song and kim reported that the ey mechanism is more important than the dp mechanism for temperature lower than 5  k.@xcite    what makes our conclusion different from that in the literature is that most of the previous investigations use eqs .",

    "<S> electron spin relaxation in bulk iii - v semiconductors is investigated from a fully microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation approach where all relevant scatterings , such as , the electron  nonmagnetic - impurity , electron - phonon , electron - electron , electron - hole , and electron - hole exchange ( the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism ) scatterings are explicitly included . </S>",
    "<S> the elliot - yafet mechanism is also fully incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> this approach offers a way toward thorough understanding of electron spin relaxation both near and far away from the equilibrium in the metallic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the dependences of the spin relaxation time on electron density , temperature , initial spin polarization , photo - excitation density , and hole density are studied thoroughly with the underlying physics analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these dependences are usually _ qualitatively _ different in the non - degenerate and degenerate regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous investigations in the literature , we find that : ( i ) in @xmath0-type materials , the elliot - yafet mechanism is _ less _ important than the dyakonov - perel mechanism , even for the narrow band - gap semiconductors such as insb and inas . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the density dependence of the spin relaxation time is nonmonotonic and we predict a _ peak _ in the metallic regime in both @xmath0-type and intrinsic materials . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) in intrinsic materials , the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism is found to be negligible compared with the dyakonov - perel mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict a peak in the temperature dependence of spin relaxation time which is due to the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the electron - electron coulomb scattering in intrinsic materials with small initial spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) in @xmath1-type iii - v semiconductors , the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism dominates spin relaxation in the low temperature regime only when the photo - excitation density is low . when the photo - excitation density is high , the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism can be comparable with the dyakonov - perel mechanism only in the moderate temperature regime roughly around the fermi temperature of electrons , whereas for higher or lower temperature it is unimportant . </S>",
    "<S> the relative importance of the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism decreases with the photo - excitation density and eventually becomes negligible at sufficiently high photo - excitation density . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of electric field on spin relaxation in @xmath0-type iii - v semiconductors is also studied with behaviors very different from those in the two - dimensional case reported . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find good agreement of our calculation with the experimental results . </S>"
