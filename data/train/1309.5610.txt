    "the experimental data for @xmath25 are presented in figure [ fig2 ] ( colored dots ) , in the complex plane .",
    "the color code gives an insight of the driving frequency @xmath0 .",
    "globally , we observe that @xmath25 draws a spiral in the complex plane . for @xmath26",
    "ghz , we observe that @xmath27 , reflecting the fact that the current injected in the outer channel remains in this channel ( @xmath28 ) . at low frequencies ( @xmath29 ghz )",
    ", @xmath25 is mainly imaginary , as expected for a capacitive coupling between the two edge states . as frequency increases , @xmath25 winds around , reaching a maximum @xmath30 for @xmath31 ghz , meaning that 75% of the charge density wave has been transferred to the inner channel . for increasing @xmath0",
    ", @xmath25 continues to spiral , decreasing to @xmath32 , then increasing again above 9 ghz ( for clarity , the corresponding data are not shown on fig.2 but the modulus and phase of @xmath25 in the range 9 ghz @xmath33 11 ghz are shown on fig.[fig3bis ] ) .",
    "this behavior demonstrates coherent oscillations of the charge density wave from one edge to the other as the driving frequency @xmath0 is varied .",
    "these oscillations can be understood in a simple manner .",
    "taking here as eigenmodes ( this assumption is discussed later ) the symmetric charge mode @xmath34 and the antisymmetric neutral mode @xmath35 , the current @xmath36 can be decomposed in the eigenbasis as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the coordinates in the eigenbasis , @xmath39 .",
    "their propagation reduces to a phase factor @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the phase velocities of respectively the charge and neutral modes , with : @xmath42 where we have assumed in eq.([s21velocity ] ) that the charge mode propagates much faster than the neutral mode , @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 .",
    "the term @xmath45 in eq.([s21velocity ] ) shows that the oscillation stems from the progressive phase shift between the charge and neutral components of the emp propagating at different velocities . in the complex plane",
    ", @xmath25 should describe a circle of radius 1/2 centered at @xmath46 , with angle @xmath47 when the frequency is varied . at low frequency , the propagation length @xmath17 is much smaller than the wavelength of the neutral mode @xmath48 and propagation effects can be neglected .",
    "one then recovers the well - established@xcite rc - circuit limit where @xmath25 starts from @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 can be expressed in term of discrete elements @xmath54 and",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 ( see methods ) .",
    "@xmath55 is the electrochemical capacitance given by the series association of a quantum capacitance @xmath57 for each channel ( where @xmath58 is the velocity in the edge channels in the absence of inter or intra edge channel interactions ) and the geometrical capacitance between channels @xmath59 .",
    "the resistor is @xmath60 , the series combination of a charge relaxation resistance @xmath61 for each channel .",
    "this corresponds to the low frequency velocity @xmath62 . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the propagation length becomes comparable with the wavelength of the neutral mode and propagation effects can not be ignored . using eq.([s21velocity ] ) , the trajectory followed by @xmath25 in the complex plane then gives a direct access to the neutral mode velocity @xmath63 or , in an equivalent way , to the @xmath11 dependence of the wave vector @xmath64 ( the dispersion relation ) related to the phase velocity by @xmath65 .",
    "one can see on fig.[fig2 ] that when the frequency is increased , @xmath25 follows the expected circle for @xmath66 ghz ( eq.([s21velocity ] ) is plotted in black line ) .",
    "however , for frequency ranging from 4 to 9 ghz , data points deviate from the expected circle and the experimental curve seems to spiral down towards a state where the charge density wave is evenly distributed between both channels with @xmath67 .",
    "this can be understood as a dissipation of the emp during propagation and can be accounted for by introducing an imaginary part in the wave vector @xmath64 .",
    "these considerations bring to light the remarkable robustness of the nyquist diagram presented on fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "separation between the charge and neutral mode show up in the inter - edge oscillations revealed by the winding of @xmath25 around the point @xmath68 , which corresponds to an equal repartition of the emp .",
    "this feature , clearly visible on fig.[fig2 ] in spite of dissipation , does not depend on the details of the interaction .",
    "the interaction characteristics are encoded in the dispersion relation @xmath64 or equivalently in the @xmath11-dependence of the phase @xmath69 . to depict interactions ,",
    "the most frequently used approach is a zero - range model@xcite .",
    "it has no characteristic length , so that the velocity @xmath70 is frequency independent : @xmath71 . since @xmath70 is frequency",
    "independent , @xmath72 draws a circle with a linear @xmath11-dependence of the phase @xmath73 .",
    "any deviation from this linear dependence reflects the existence of a finite range in the interactions which can be unveiled through a careful study of the frequency dependence of @xmath25 .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] presents our measurements of the dispersion relation @xmath64 where the complex value of @xmath74 is extracted from eq.([s21velocity ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the existence of an imaginary part @xmath75 in the wave vector @xmath74 signals the presence of dissipation .",
    "two non - dispersive regimes are observed : at low frequency , @xmath76 , with @xmath77 m.s@xmath78 .",
    "this regime of constant velocity with respect to frequency is consistent with a short range description of interactions in the low frequency limit .",
    "however , for @xmath79 ghz , a second linear dispersion relation regime appears @xmath80 , with @xmath81 m.s@xmath78 .",
    "we attribute this decrease of @xmath70 to the finite range of interactions . to go beyond this qualitative discussion",
    ", we now rely on a quantitative comparison between our experimental data for @xmath25 and various models of intra - edge and inter - edge interaction .      in figure [ fig3bis ] ,",
    "experimental data for @xmath82 and @xmath83 are presented as a function of driving frequency @xmath0 . at low frequency , the rc - circuit behavior is recovered and the agreement with the experimental data is good in the range 0.73 ghz , with a value of @xmath84 ps extracted from the low - frequency regime of the dispersion relation .",
    "however , this rc - circuit model ( green small dashes ) does not predict oscillations . the zero - range interaction model , obtained by locally coupling the electrostatic potential of the edges to the charge densities ( see methods and fig.[fig5 ] ) for which the velocity is frequency independent , @xmath85 is plotted in dashed red line . as already discussed",
    ", it does predict the oscillations , but fails to describe accurately the regime of high frequencies ( 3 to 11 ghz ) .",
    "once @xmath53 , which prescribes the low frequency behavior , is fixed , no other parameter is to be fixed for the zero range model .    to capture these features ,",
    "an heuristic long range model has been developed ( see methods and fig.[fig5 ] ) based on a discrete element description @xcite .",
    "an effective range on the order of the propagation length @xmath17 is introduced by assuming that the electrostatic potentials of each edge state are constant over @xmath17 , and by coupling these potentials to the total charges in the channels via a capacitance @xmath59 .",
    "this long range model depends on two timescales @xmath86 and @xmath87 such that the velocity @xmath88 becomes frequency dependent , @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 .",
    "an intrinsic dissipation inside each edge channel that accounts for the damping of the charge oscillations is introduced through the parameter @xmath92 .",
    "we choose the following @xmath11 dependence , @xmath93 , which is still compatible with a discrete circuit elements description at low frequency .",
    "dissipation modifies the value of the resistance in the rc circuit description : a resistor of @xmath94 is added in series with the charge relaxation resistor @xmath61 . putting first @xmath95 ( no dissipation ) , this long - range interaction model captures already both the low - frequency behavior and the period of oscillation ( see the blue dash - dotted curve on fig.[fig3bis ] ) from which we extract @xmath96 ps ( which implies @xmath97 ps since we have set @xmath98 ps ) . a good agreement with experimental data including dissipation",
    "can then be obtained using @xmath99 ps ( black curve on fig .",
    "[ fig3bis ] ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath100 extracted from our data is rather small , @xmath101 such that the low - frequency regime is not strongly affected . from the evaluated value of @xmath102 , we also deduce @xmath103 m.s@xmath78 , consistently with the velocity @xmath104 m.s@xmath78 extracted from the dispersion relation .",
    "these values are compatible with the assumption @xmath105 estimating the charge velocity from experiments performed with similar samples@xcite . in ref .",
    "indeed find a charge velocity of a few @xmath106 m.s@xmath78 at filling factor @xmath3 for an ungated two dimensional electron gas .",
    "their sample characteristics are close to ours , it is made from a gallium arsenide heterostructure , the electron gas has a density of @xmath107 and mobility @xmath108 ( close to our values , see methods ) and the sample edges are defined by chemical etching ( as ours ) .",
    "simulations of the dispersion relation with the same parameters are also presented in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the overall behavior of re(@xmath74 ) is well - rendered : though not as abrupt , the change in the velocities is as expected described by the long - range interaction . in the meantime , im(@xmath74 ) is also correctly depicted with our choice of dissipation for the emp : @xmath109 .      throughout the paper ,",
    "the case of symmetric edge channels has been considered which naturally leads to the existence of pure charged and neutral eigenmodes . as there is no reason for both edge channels to have identical propagation properties",
    ", one should consider in full generality the decomposition @xmath110 , where the eigenmodes @xmath111 and @xmath112 are parametrized by the angle @xmath113 : @xmath114 the case @xmath115 corresponds to completely independent channels while @xmath116 corresponds to the strong coupling case where the eigenmodes are the charged ( @xmath117 ) and neutral ( @xmath118 ) modes .",
    "as already discussed , the latter situation occurs in the case of identical edge channels but can also occur for non - identical channels as long as the interchannel interaction is strong enough ( see methods ) .",
    "any other intermediate case corresponds to partially charged eigenmodes for which one can define the ratio @xmath119 of the total charge carried by modes @xmath120 and @xmath121 from the expression of the eigenmodes , eq.([eigenvecs ] ) : @xmath122 . for @xmath123 ,",
    "the contribution of the antisymmetric mode to the current is 0 , reflecting its neutrality . in this general case ,",
    "the expressions for @xmath72 and @xmath124 , and thus for the measured quantity @xmath25 , differ from eqs .",
    "( [ srho ] ) , ( [ sn ] ) , ( [ s21velocity ] ) : @xmath125 eq.([s21theta ] ) , shows that @xmath72 describes coherent oscillations from channel 1 to channel 2 , whose amplitude are given by the factor @xmath126 .",
    "this amplitudes only reaches unity at strong coupling @xmath123 , the only regime where a complete charge transfer from one channel to the other can be achieved .",
    "@xmath127 is also affected and oscillates ( either with frequency @xmath0 or length @xmath17 ) reflecting the fact that in this general case , the charge mode @xmath128 is no longer an eigenmode such that the total current @xmath129 oscillates instead of simply accumulating a phase . as a result , @xmath25 still follows a circle in the complex plane but with a @xmath113 dependent radius and center . from these general expressions and the comparison with our experimental data",
    ", one can assess that the eigenmodes are indeed the charge and neutral ones , within an accuracy of @xmath130 for the charge ratio between the eigenmodes .",
    "the first argument comes from the low frequency behavior of @xmath25 where dissipation can be safely neglected .",
    "both the modulus @xmath82 and the phase @xmath83 follow a linear @xmath11 dependence but with two different @xmath113 dependent slopes , @xmath131 , @xmath132 . by measuring the ratio of these slopes",
    ", one can directly measure the angle @xmath113 .",
    "remarkably , in the strong coupling case , @xmath133 , data points for @xmath82 and @xmath134 should follow the exact same frequency dependence in the low frequency regime . data points in the low frequency @xmath135 ghz range are plotted on fig.[fig6 ] , with their linear fits . a linear fit for @xmath82 ( in the @xmath136 ghz range , as @xmath82 approaches its maximum for @xmath137 ghz ) is presented in black plain line , yielding @xmath138 .",
    "similarly , @xmath134 is fitted in red line in the range @xmath139 ghz range , with @xmath140 .",
    "data below 1.2 ghz are not used in the fitting procedure due to their dispersion , as , at low frequency , @xmath83 is obtained from the ratio between two small currents .",
    "the slope of @xmath82 , that is , the value of @xmath141 for small @xmath11 , is determined with a 10% accuracy .",
    "it thus defines two bounds ( dashed blue lines ) that correspond to the slopes of @xmath134 for @xmath142 ( upper bound ) @xmath143 ( lower bound ) .",
    "these extremum values of the angle @xmath113 correspond to a charge ratio @xmath144 .",
    "our data points for @xmath134 fall between these bounds which assesses the neutrality of the slow mode with a 10% accuracy .",
    "the second argument comes from the study of the full trajectory of @xmath25 in the complex plane . from the amplitude of the oscillations of the emp from one edge to the other ,",
    "a lower bound for @xmath113 can be obtained , @xmath145 corresponding to @xmath146 .",
    "this lower bound is obtained by assuming that the amplitude of the oscillation is only limited by the value of @xmath113 and neglects fully the dissipation .",
    "taking into account dissipation , the full trajectory and in particular the position of the center of the spiral described by @xmath25 confirm @xmath147 with the same accuracy of @xmath148 as in the low frequency regime .",
    "we have directly observed the collective excitations of two coupled chiral edge channels at filling factor 2 and demonstrated that it consisted in an antisymmetric neutral mode and a symmetric mode carrying the charge . by creating selectively a charge density wave at frequency @xmath0 in the outer edge and measuring the current transferred to the inner one , we have observed oscillations as a function of frequency that reflect the phase shift between the charge and neutral modes .",
    "the minima of these oscillations correspond to integer values of the ratio @xmath149 between the propagation length and the wavelength of the neutral mode . from these measurements ,",
    "we have deduced the dissipation and dispersion relation of the neutral mode , @xmath150 . we have observed two non - dispersive regimes , corresponding to a phase velocity @xmath77 m.s@xmath78 at low frequency and @xmath81 m.s@xmath78 at high frequency .",
    "comparing our results with various models of inter - edge interactions , our results show that edge channel propagation differs from the ideal luttinger limit of dissipationless propagation with short range interaction , but rather agrees with a model of dissipative channels coupled through a long range interaction .",
    "dissipation could be caused by the internal structure of compressible edges leading to a coupling of emp to acoustic modes @xcite but a non ambiguous diagnosis will require further investigation .",
    "the sample is realized in a standard gaas / ga(al)as two dimensional electron gas located 100 nm below the surface , of density @xmath151 and mobility @xmath152 .",
    "the sample is then patterned using e - beam lithography and chemical etching of the heterojunction , and by deposition of metallic gates at the surface .",
    "the electron gas is contacted using gold / germanium ohmic contacts schematically represented as white squares on fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the sample is placed in a strong magnetic field @xmath153 t so as to reach a filling factor @xmath3 in the bulk ( see fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "a driven mesoscopic capacitor ( described in references @xcite ) is used to selectively inject current in the outer edge channel ( labeled 1 ) .",
    "the mesoscopic capacitor comprises a small portion of the electron gas ( of submicronic size ) , called a quantum dot , capacitively coupled to a metallic top gate , see fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "a quantum point contact is used to fully transmit the outer edge channel ( 1 ) inside the dot while the inner channel ( 2 ) is fully reflected .",
    "a sine drive of frequency @xmath154 is applied on the metallic top gate deposited on top of the dot , so that an emp of frequency @xmath0 is capacitively induced in the outer channel , carrying a current @xmath155 .",
    "the propagation takes place on a length @xmath156 m , during which channels are interacting .",
    "the emp then reaches a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , that allows to reflect or transmit selectively each edge channel .",
    "the reflected ac current flows toward ohmic contact a , situated at distance @xmath157 m from the qpc , and where the total current is measured .",
    "note that the propagation after the qpc , on length @xmath158 , is irrelevant in the analysis of the data : according to eq.([srho ] ) , measuring the total reflected current in ohmic contact a is equivalent , up to a phase factor @xmath159 , to measuring the total current flowing right after the qpc .",
    "the current is measured using a wideband room temperature homodyne detection .",
    "a set of microwave filters and room - temperature low noise amplifiers enables a proper measurement in the 0.7 to 11 ghz range .",
    "note that @xmath25 does not depend on the total gain of the amplifying detection scheme which varies considerably in the studied frequency range .",
    "each reported data point results from a simple averaging protocol , and the statistical analysis is in good agreement with the observed dispersion of the experimental data . at low frequency ( below 1 ghz ) , the quality of our measurements is limited by the bandwidth of our filters and amplifiers . at high frequency ( above 10 ghz ) , it is limited for the same reason , combined with increased attenuation of the output rf coaxial cables .",
    "experiments were performed in a dilution fridge of base temperature 50 mk . by performing coulomb thermometry on the mesoscopic capacitor@xcite , we have calibrated the electronic temperature to @xmath160 mk .      in the integer quantum hall regime , edge magnetoplasmons in channel 1 ( outer ) and",
    "2 ( inner ) are described by a chiral bosonic field @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) . in this approach",
    ", the two edge channels are bosonized in the spirit of wen s description of quantum hall edges as chiral luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "the current in channel @xmath163 is then determined by @xmath164 , while the charge density is @xmath165 .",
    "both are related via the current conservation equation . in",
    "fourier space , the motion of the chiral field @xmath166 along the edge obeys : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the velocity of edge channel @xmath163 in the absence of interactions and @xmath169 the potential in edge channel @xmath163 .",
    "the term @xmath92 models an intrinsic dissipation inside the edge states that accounts for the damping of the charge oscillations .",
    "eq.([eqphi ] ) can be rewritten as a function of the current in edge channel @xmath163 : @xmath170    first , let us consider the non - damped case @xmath171 .",

    "<S> coulomb interactions have a major role in one - dimensional electronic transport . </S>",
    "<S> they modify the nature of the elementary excitations from landau quasiparticles in higher dimensions to collective excitations in one dimension . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the direct observation of the collective neutral and charge modes of the two chiral co - propagating edge channels of opposite spins of the quantum hall effect at filling factor 2 . generating a charge density wave at frequency @xmath0 in the outer channel </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the current induced by inter - channel coulomb interaction in the inner channel after a 3-mm propagation length . </S>",
    "<S> varying the driving frequency from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ghz , we observe damped oscillations in the induced current that result from the phase shift between the fast charge and slow neutral eigenmodes . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the dispersion relation and dissipation of the neutral mode from which we deduce quantitative information on the interaction range and parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> most studies of collective excitations in one dimensional systems performed so far have focused on non - chiral quantum wires @xcite . in these systems , </S>",
    "<S> the collective excitations carrying the charge and the spin propagate at different velocities leading to the separation of the charge and spin degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this spin - charge separation has been probed by measuring the tunneling spectroscopy of individual electrons between a pair of one dimensional wires @xcite , or alternatively , between a wire and a two dimensional electron gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a direct observation of the collective modes is experimentally challenging as the relevant energy scales are too high for usual low frequency measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> the edge channels of the quantum hall effect provide another implementation of one dimensional transport , where propagation is chiral and ballistic over large distances . </S>",
    "<S> these specificities have inspired several experiments that aim at reproducing , in solid state , optical setups where light beams are replaced by electron beams@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one major difference between electrons and photons comes from interaction effects , which are amplified in the one dimensional geometry and should enrich electron optics compared to its photonic counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the case of filling factor @xmath3 where transport along the sample edge occurs through two copropagating edge channels of opposite spins . due to coulomb interaction , the two edge states are coupled and new propagating eigenmodes , with different velocities , appear@xcite , similarly to the physics arising in 1d wires . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , considering edge channels with the same propagation characteristics ( but different spins ) , and denoting @xmath4 the current components in edge channels @xmath5 and @xmath3 at position @xmath6 and time @xmath7 , a current @xmath8 in channel @xmath5 decomposes in the symmetric fast charge mode @xmath9 and the antisymmetric slow neutral mode @xmath10 ( also called dipolar mode ) . as these two modes propagate at different velocities , </S>",
    "<S> the current initially injected in channel 1 separates into the charge and the neutral modes of the two coupled edges . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is at the heart of the decoherence@xcite and relaxation@xcite of electronic excitations propagating in these systems . as such </S>",
    "<S> , it has been probed through mach - zehnder interferometry@xcite or spectroscopy of edge channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this situation bears strong analogies with the spin - charge separation of conventional 1d wires except that the two spin species are carried by two separated edge channels . </S>",
    "<S> the direct observation of the neutral and charge eigenmodes is thus particularly favorable in the filling factor 2 case as , contrary to a conventional wire , each spin channel can be individually addressed due to their spatial separation . </S>",
    "<S> still , the observation remains challenging as transport properties remain unaffected up to ghz frequencies , where the wavelength of the eigenmodes becomes comparable with the propagation length of a few microns . </S>",
    "<S> many experimental works have studied charge transport in quantum hall edge channels and interaction effects between copropagating and counterpropagating edge channels either in time @xcite or in frequency @xcite domains . however , none directly addressed the separation in charge and neutral modes as the individual control of edge channels was missing .    in this work , by addressing edge channels individually , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a direct observation of the neutral - charge eigenmodes . using a driven mesoscopic capacitor ( fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) , see methods for details ) , a sinusoidal charge density wave , or edge magnetoplasmon ( emp ) is induced at pulsation @xmath11 and position @xmath12 in channel 1 , thus creating a current @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as initially introduced in the context of a non chiral one dimensional wire @xcite and later developed for chiral edge channels @xcite at filling factor @xmath3 , coulomb interaction during propagation can be described as the scattering of the charge density waves . for the case of filling factor @xmath3 of interest here , scattering properties of emps </S>",
    "<S> are encoded in the @xmath15 scattering matrix @xmath16 that relates the amplitudes of the output emp in channels 1 and 2 after propagation length @xmath17 to the amplitudes of the input emp at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> after an interaction length @xmath18 m , both edge channels reach a quantum point contact ( qpc ) which is used to transmit or reflect channels 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1](b ) presents the principle of measurement for two typical sets of data ( for @xmath19 and 5.5 ghz ) . in configuration </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 , channel 1 is transmitted and channel @xmath3 is reflected . </S>",
    "<S> the current in channel 2 resulting from the interaction , denoted @xmath20 , can then be measured in ohmic contact @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . when the qpc is closed ( configuration 2 ) , both channels are reflected so that the total collected current in @xmath21 is @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> . consequently , the ratio of the currents collected in these two configurations yields the complex quantity @xmath24 , which encodes the effect of coulomb interaction on the propagation along the edge states . </S>"
