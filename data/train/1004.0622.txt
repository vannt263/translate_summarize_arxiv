    "frustrated quantum antiferromagnets have long been a subject of active research , since anderson@xcite suggested resonating - valence - bond ground state for a triangular lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "recent experimental studies of quasi - two - dimensional compounds , such as the organic mott insulator@xcite @xmath8-(bedt - ttf)@xmath6cu@xmath6(cn)@xmath9 and the transition metal chloride cs@xmath6cucl@xmath10,@xcite have further prompted theoretical research of anisotropic triangular lattice antiferromagnets.@xcite in these anisotropic quasi - two - dimensional antiferromagnets combination of frustrated exchange interactions and strong quantum fluctuations suppresses tendency toward conventional magnetic orders , thereby opening up possibilities of exotic quantum states .",
    "a zigzag spin ladder is a one - dimensional ( 1d ) strip of the anisotropic triangular lattice spin system , and can be regarded as a minimal , toy model of ( strongly anisotropic quasi - two - dimensional ) frustrated quantum magnets .",
    "furthermore , the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model on the zigzag ladder is in itself a good model for various quasi-1d magnetic compounds , such as ( n@xmath6h@xmath11)cucl@xmath9,@xcite rb@xmath6cu@xmath6mo@xmath9o@xmath12,@xcite and licuvo@xmath10.@xcite despite its simplicity , the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model has been shown to exhibit various unconventional phases under magnetic field ( as we summarize below).@xcite in this paper we aim to clarify the nature of the phases in the ground - state phase diagram of the 1d spin-@xmath13 @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model under magnetic field , when both the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor exchange couplings are _ antiferromagnetic _ ( af ) . to this end",
    ", we study in detail spin correlations in each phase using the numerical density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method as well as low - energy effective theory based on bosonization .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg zigzag spin ladder is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a spin-@xmath13 operator at @xmath16th site , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are respectively the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor exchange couplings ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , and @xmath2 is external magnetic field along the @xmath19-direction .    in the classical limit",
    ", the ground state of the zigzag ladder @xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet has a helical magnetic structure @xmath20 with a pitch angle @xmath21 and a canting angle @xmath22 for @xmath23 , whereas the ground state has canted nel order for @xmath24 .    in the quantum ( @xmath25 ) case , the ground - state properties of the model ( [ eq : ham ] )",
    "change drastically from the classical spin state .",
    "the ground state at zero magnetic field @xmath26 has been understood quite well . for small @xmath27 ,",
    "the ground state is in a critical tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) phase with gapless excitations .",
    "the model undergoes a quantum phase transition at @xmath28,@xcite to a gapped phase with spontaneous dimerization@xcite for @xmath29 .",
    "it is also known that the model exhibits a long - range order ( lro ) of vector chirality in the case of anisotropic exchange couplings.@xcite    with applied magnetic field , the phase diagram becomes even richer . from numerical studies of the magnetization process",
    ", it has been found that for a certain range of @xmath3 the magnetization curve exhibits a plateau at one - third of the saturated magnetization and cusp singularities.@xcite in this @xmath5-plateau phase , the ground state has a magnetic lro of _ up - up - down _ structure .",
    "furthermore , it was found that away from the @xmath5-plateau and at @xmath30 , the total magnetization @xmath31 changes in units of @xmath32 , indicating that two spins form a bound pair and flip simultaneously as the field @xmath2 increases.@xcite these characteristic changes in the magnetization process give accurate estimates of phase boundaries , which divide the parameter space into several regions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] below ) , although the magnetization process alone can not give much information on the nature of each phase .",
    "another interesting feature of the @xmath0-@xmath1 zigzag ladder in magnetic field is a field - induced lro of the vector chirality , @xmath33 in zero field , the vector chiral lro has been found when and only when the system has an easy - plane anisotropy.@xcite in this case , due to the anisotropy , symmetry of the system in spin space is lowered from isotropic @xmath34 to @xmath35 , where the @xmath36 and @xmath37 symmetries correspond to the rotation in the easy plane and the sign of pitch angle of helical spin order , respectively .",
    "while the continuous @xmath36 symmetry is preserved in the quantum case @xmath38,@xcite the discrete @xmath37 symmetry can be spontaneously broken even in the quantum limit @xmath25 , thereby resulting in the vector chiral phase .",
    "this line of symmetry consideration suggests that the magnetic field , which induces the same symmetry reduction , should also lead to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "indeed , this possibility was first pointed out by kolezhuk and vekua,@xcite who have predicted from a field - theoretical analysis that the vector chiral lro may set in for a large @xmath3 regime . recently",
    ", the appearance of the vector chiral lro under magnetic field was verified numerically.@xcite    in this paper , we report our numerical and analytic results of the ground - state properties in the various phases that appear under magnetic field . from a thorough comparison of long - distance behavior of correlation functions ,",
    "we identify effective theories that describe the low - energy physics of each phase . for this purpose , we calculate numerically various correlation functions , which include longitudinal - spin , transverse - spin , vector chiral , and nematic ( two - magnon ) correlation functions using the dmrg method.@xcite comparing the numerical results with asymptotic forms derived from bosonization analysis , we find that , in addition to the gapped dimer phase , @xmath5-plateau phase , and fully polarized phase , the system exhibits four critical phases : ( i ) a phase with one - component tll which is adiabatically connected to the ground state of the 1d heisenberg antiferromagnet ( tll1 phase ) , ( ii ) a two - component tll phase ( tll2 phase ) , ( iii ) a vector chiral phase , and ( iv ) a spin - density - wave phase with two - spin bound pairs ( sdw@xmath6 phase ) .",
    "the low - energy states in the tll1 , vector chiral , and sdw@xmath6 phases turn out to be one - component tlls ( a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath39 ) .",
    "furthermore , we provide quantitative estimates of non - universal parameters appearing in the low - energy effective theories , such as the tll parameter and incommensurate wavenumbers of spin correlations , as functions of @xmath3 and the magnetization . in particular , our results of the tll parameter , which controls decay exponents of correlation functions , have direct relevance to experimental observables , e.g. , a magnetic lro emerging in real quasi-1d compounds with weak interladder couplings and temperature dependence of relaxation rates ( @xmath40 ) in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.@xcite we also propose a two - component tll theory to describe the tll2 phase .",

    "these critical phases consist of three one - component tll phases ( the tll1 , sdw@xmath6 , and vector chiral phases ) and a two - component tll phase , the tll2 phase . from the fitting , we numerically estimated the tll parameter in one - component tll phases as a function of @xmath3 and the magnetization @xmath42 .",
    "the results allow us to determine the decay exponents of the algebraic spin correlation functions and reveal the dominant correlation function in each phase .",
    "in addition , we developed an effective theory for the two - component tll , which reasonably reproduces numerically obtained correlation functions in the tll2 phase , which appears in two parameter regions in between the tll1 and vector chiral phases .",

    "the dominant algebraic correlation in the purely 1d model leads to the magnetic lro in the real quasi-1d compounds . based on our results on the correlation functions",
    ", we can thus predict that several different magnetic - ordered phases appear in the quasi-1d zigzag ladder compounds ; in the parameter regime of the tll1 phase , we expect a canted antiferromagnetic ordered phase for small @xmath3 and an incommensurate longitudinal spin - density wave ordered phase with a wavenumber @xmath519 for slightly larger @xmath3 .",
    "the region of the sdw@xmath6 phase will be replaced by an incommensurate longitudinal spin - density wave ordered phase with @xmath91 .",

    " fan \" phase characterized by the coexistence of incommensurate longitudinal- and transverse - spin lros .",
    "this is consistent with the argument by ueda and totsuka;@xcite they showed , using a dilute bose gas description , that the coplanar fan phase appears near saturation in the quasi-1d system in a wide parameter region around @xmath520 .",
    "another related quasi-1d system is a spatially anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet , with interchain exchange @xmath521 much weaker than the intrachain exchange @xmath522 .",
    "this model was studied recently@xcite and the obtained phase diagram shows a resemblance to that of the zigzag ladder . in 1d limit of @xmath523 , starykh and",
    "balents@xcite found a collinear spin - density wave with wave vector @xmath524 in intermediate magnetic field regime and a cone phase with spiral transverse order in high magnetic field regime .",
    "kohno@xcite also found instability to the ordering of incommensurate longitudinal spin - density wave with momentum @xmath524 applying weak - coupling analysis to 1d exact solution .",
    "if we take a zigzag ladder out of this anisotropic triangular system , the nature of the incommensurate spin - density wave and cone phases , respectively , is essentially the same as that of the sdw@xmath6 and vector chiral phases we showed in the regime of @xmath221 .",
    "( note that the definition of the unit length along chains on the anisotropic triangular lattice is twice larger than that we used in the zigzag ladder . )",
