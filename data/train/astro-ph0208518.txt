    "after the failure of the main mission of the wide field infrared explorer ( _ wire _ ) satellite , launched by nasa in 1999 march , its star tracker was used for asteroseismology of bright objects ( buzasi et al . 2000 ; buzasi 2002 ) . here we report on preliminary analysis of observations of the red giant arcturus ( @xmath3 boo ) , which is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere , and has been observed in velocity several times ( belmonte et al . 1990a ; 1990b ; merline 1995 ) .",
    "nearly 1.2 million 0.1-s exposures were obtained during 19 successive days in 2000 july - august .",
    "1 presents the light curve .",
    "the data from each orbit were binned into a single mean point with a typical error of about 15 ppm .",
    "the light curve shows changes on time scales of hours to days .",
    "the upper panel of fig .  2 displays the amplitude spectrum of the data .",
    "there is an excess of power at low frequencies .",
    "the highest peak at 4.11 @xmath2hz is in agreement with the ground - based radial velocity and photometry study of belmonte et al .",
    "( 1990a ; 1990b ) .",
    "table  1 lists the ten highest peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "the typical frequency error is @xmath10.1 @xmath2hz .",
    "peak 4 ( 0.98 @xmath2hz ) is questionable as the data extend over only @xmath12.5 cycles of it .",
    "3 presents the amplitude spectrum at the frequency range of 0 - 20 @xmath2hz .",
    "the dotted vertical lines show the locations of the ten highest peaks .    [ cols=\">,>,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the amplitude and frequency of the power excess in arcturus are consistent with solar - like oscillations ( kjeldsen & bedding 1995 ) .",
    "the strongest peaks have a frequency spacing of @xmath4  0.8@xmath5hz , which is in excellent agreement with the expected value of 0.9@xmath60.1 ( kjeldsen & bedding 1995 ) , but not with the value of 5.0 @xmath2hz reported by belmonte et al .",
    "( 1990a ; 1990b ) .",
    "we note , however , that our value of @xmath7 is very close to our frequency resolution ( @xmath10.55 @xmath2hz ) , which is set by the length of the run .",
    "the same was true for the observations by belmonte et al .    could granulation noise , rather than oscillations , be responsible for the excess power ?",
    "this is unlikely , since the variability is also detected in velocity , with an amplitude of @xmath160 m/s at 4.3@xmath2hz ( belmonte et al .",
    "1990a ; 1990b ) .",
    "the ratio of the photometric amplitude to the velocity amplitude is as expected for sound waves , and about ten times greater than expected for granulation noise .",
    "we conclude that the variations in arcturus can be explained by sound waves , but it is not clear whether these are coherent p - mode oscillations or perhaps a single mode with a short lifetime .",
    "a longer time series is required to distinguish between the two options .",
