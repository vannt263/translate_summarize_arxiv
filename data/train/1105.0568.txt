    "in recent years the thermodynamic properties of a quantum system driven out of equilibrium have attracted more and more attention  @xcite . especially , in mesoscopic transport a standard method of studying nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) has been established by using the evolution approach in keldysh formalism  @xcite . in mesoscopic transport",
    "we study small quantum systems with a few degrees of freedom which must be described by quantum mechanics .",
    "the small system is connected to several infinite reservoirs which are in thermal equilibrium with different temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "the nonequilibrium steady state is approached by an evolution starting from the supposed initial condition .",
    "the evolution approach has been widely used to study the transport through quantum point contacts , quantum dots , single molecules and carbon nanotubes .",
    "good agreements between theoretical predictions and experimental results have been obtained .",
    "now a fundamental question arises as to whether the concepts in equilibrium thermodynamics apply to the mesoscopic system driven out of equilibrium .",
    "for example , temperature is an important concept in equilibrium thermodynamics , where it is also called the intensive thermodynamic variable of a system . according to the zeroth law of thermodynamics",
    ", it is always possible to assign a temperature to a system in thermal equilibrium . even if the whole system is out of equilibrium , when the conditions of local equilibrium are fulfilled",
    ", we can divide the system into small cells which are in thermal equilibrium to a good approximation . in principle",
    "we are then able to define the local temperature in each cell .",
    "however , up to now the sole way of calculating temperature according to the density matrix of a system is by using the extremal principle in statistical mechanics .",
    "according to glansdorff and prigogine  @xcite in systems away from equilibrium there is no general variational principle .",
    "then temperature , arising from the lagrangian multiplier in statistical mechanics , loses its meaning .",
    "even if many authors make their efforts in the local extremal principles  @xcite which can be used for local solutions when the system is not far from equilibrium and dissipative processes dominate there , there is no consensus in if these principles can be applied to mesoscopic transport  @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic transport should have been a touchstone of the principles in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "but it is not the case because of lack of definitions of local intensive thermodynamic variables , which play central roles in statistical mechanics . in evolution approach",
    "even if the currents can be easily calculated , up to now there is no way of calculating the temperature in a local region of the mesoscopic device . because the current and the temperature are two different kinds of physical quantities .",
    "the current is calculated as the expectation value of the quantum operator of current with respect to the density matrix of the system . while the temperature is intensive , which in statistical mechanics is introduced by hand as a lagrangian multiplier before one writes down the density matrix .",
    "there is no `` temperature operator '' , although in fact temperature is also measurable like all the other physical quantities .",
    "such a discrepancy between temperature and other physical quantities causes troubles in the theory of quantum transport .",
    "in fact there is no reason for ignoring the local intensive variables in mesoscopic device , since in principle we could continuously increase the device size without meeting a breakdown point of the physical laws behind , i.e. the schrdinger equation , until the device is in the macroscopic region where the driving forces are the gradients of intensive variables rather than their differences in reservoirs .    in this paper",
    "we get rid of this discrepancy by introducing a method of checking if the local equilibrium condition is fulfilled in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states and of calculating the local temperature and chemical potential .",
    "we apply our method in a disordered chain subject to a current , and study the onsite chemical potential by attaching an auxiliary site to it .",
    "we study the distribution of onsite chemical potentials at different disorder strength and reservoir voltage bias . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss how to reach the nonequilibrium steady state in an evolution approach by taking thermodynamic limit before taking @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the condtion of local equilibrium and suggest a method of calculating the local intensive variables . in sec .",
    "iv , we introduce the model of disordered 1d chain and show the distribution of onsite chemical potentials inside it subject to finite voltage bias .",
    "v is a short summary .",
    "when we say that a system evolves into a nonequilibrium steady state , we mean that when time goes to infinity the system relaxes towards a stationary state in which some flows are nonzero , but there is no time variation .",
    "the ness should be distinguished with the equilibrium state in which some nonzero flows exist in a ring structure .",
    "the latter can exist in an isolated system with finite number of degrees of freedom , such as the mesoscopic ring in a magnetic field with a persistent current .",
    "but an isolated system with finite number of degrees of freedom will never evolve into ness . since if there exists a flow in an irreversible process , the flow carries some quantity ( mass , energy or charge ) from one part of the system to the other part , causing a continuous decreasing of the quantity in one part and increasing in the other part due to the conservation law .",
    "this contradicts the steady state argument .    to avoid the paradox between irreversibility and stationarity",
    ", we embed the system in an environment so that the composite isolated system is infinite .",
    "then the total quantity in the whole system is infinite , so that any global conservation law is invalidated . at the same time",
    "if we see the local subsystem , the density of matter and the flow are both time invariant .    in practice , to approach a nonequilibrium steady state we generally begin with a finite model and then increase the number of degrees of freedom into infinity .",
    "this process is called taking thermodynamic limit .",
    "one must notice that in most cases taking thermodynamic limit and taking @xmath1 are not exchangeable . to get the nonequilibrium steady state one must take thermodynamic limit before taking @xmath2 .",
    "next we give two examples , namely single impurity anderson model and an infinite chain .",
    "let us recall single impurity anderson model which describes a quantum dot coupled to two leads ( the left and right leads ) .",
    "this model is exactly solvable without considering electron - electron interaction and has been extensively studied in condensed matter community .",
    "it is well known that a stationary current through the dot will be established if the two leads are in different chemical potentials and the coupling between leads and the dot has been switched on in the infinite past .",
    "the crucial condition for a stationary nonzero current is that the number of levels in leads must be infinite .",
    "otherwise the current perpetually oscillates with an average value of zero .",
    "this is easy to see if we suppose there is only one level in each lead .",
    "then the hamiltonian is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the annihilation operators in left lead , right lead and the dot respectively .",
    "the left lead is occupied by an electron at time @xmath7 . after switching on the coupling",
    ", we find the current to be @xmath8 which satisfies the conservation law @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the electron number in left lead .",
    "whatever finite number of levels there are in leads , the time - averaged current must be zero .",
    "otherwise the current will eventually empty one lead and overflow the other . in thermodynamic limit , however , the term in righthand side of eq .  [ conservation ] is nonsense since @xmath10 is infinite .",
    "so the conservation law does not prohibit a nonzero current any more .",
    "one should notice that the stationary current in ness is not carried by the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "the invariant term of current operator in anderson model is zero . in other words ,",
    "the expecation value of @xmath11 is zero with regard to arbitrary eigenstate , because the current operator is @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the fact that the eigenstates carry no current distinguishes ness with equilibrium states carrying nonzero current .      in single impurity anderson model",
    "we employ the open boundary conditions , while the ness can also be approached in an infinite chain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian of a chain of length @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions is written as @xmath14 in momentum basis it is diagonal as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the operator at site @xmath17 is expressed in momentum basis as @xmath18 then we immediately have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the propagator .",
    "now we suppose that the sites from @xmath21 to @xmath22 are all occupied by electrons and sites from @xmath23 to @xmath24 are empty at initial time @xmath7 .",
    "then the hopping interaction in eq .",
    "[ hoppinghamiltonian ] is switched on . the local current and electron density at arbitrary time",
    "are worked out easily , given the current operator from site @xmath17 to @xmath25 as @xmath26 obviously this definition satisfies the local conservation law @xmath27 .",
    "the current evaluates to @xmath28 and the electron density at site @xmath17 evaluates to @xmath29 according to the behavior of scaled parameter @xmath30 as @xmath31 , the system will evolve into either a ness with nonzero local current or a steady state with zero current everywhere .",
    "to @xmath32 for different chain length when @xmath33 is a constant . here",
    "we set @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35-axis is the ratio of current to @xmath30 and @xmath36-axis the time .",
    "one should notice that the unit of time is not shown in the figure .",
    "but it is in fact @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath38 has converged when @xmath39 is as large as @xmath40.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    if @xmath33 keeps a constant , the electron density @xmath41 and the ratio @xmath42 oscillate around some values with a period which does not vary with @xmath39 ( see fig .  1 ) . as @xmath43 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 both",
    "have well defined thermodynamic limits . for arbitrary",
    "@xmath17 , the oscillation amplitudes of @xmath41 and @xmath42 decay in course of time .",
    "when time goes to infinity the electron density approaches to @xmath44 and the current to zero everywhere .    if @xmath30 keeps a constant , however , as @xmath39 increasing the period of functions @xmath41 and @xmath45 increases accordingly . for any finite @xmath39 ,",
    "the current eventually decays towards zero .",
    "but if we take thermodynamic limit firstly , the period of oscillations goes to infinity .",
    "the current at some sites will approach to a nonzero value when we take @xmath0 thereafter .     when @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "here we set @xmath46 .",
    "with increasing @xmath39 the period of current will go to infinity .",
    "if one takes @xmath43 before taking @xmath1 , the steady limit of current will be around @xmath47.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    let us first study the currents at sites @xmath48 as @xmath49 is a constant .",
    "one should notice @xmath17 will vary with @xmath39 . in thermodynamic limit these sites are infinitely far away from the electron reservoir ( the sites from @xmath50 to @xmath39 ) , so that the current @xmath51 and the electron density @xmath52 both approach to zero . on the other hand at the site @xmath48 as @xmath53 , which is in the reservoir , the current approaches to zero and the electron density approaches to one .",
    "the site @xmath54 as @xmath55 is an arbitrary integer is in the boundary between the reservoir and the vacuum . there the current approaches approximately to @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , a nonzero value . at the same time the electron density approaches to @xmath44 . here @xmath55 can be arbitrarily large or small since in thermodynamic limit we always have @xmath56 whatever @xmath55 is .",
    "then in the system consisting of sites @xmath54 , which can be even macroscopic in size , there exists a well defined nonequilibrium steady state .    as shown above , solving equations of motion and taking thermodynamic limit before taking @xmath1 supply a platform for studying the ness . in next section",
    "we will discuss how to define the thermodynamic intensive variables , such as temperature and chemical potential , in the ness got by this approach .",
    "the definition of intensive variabls is important both in experiments where they can be measured and in the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics where they must be given before hand .",
    "today quantum mechanics is believed to be the universal theory describing the evolution of both microscopic and macroscopic systems . in quantum mechanics the observables",
    "are represented by linear operators acting on the hilbert space . on the other hand the concepts in themodynamics , such as temperature @xmath57 and chemical potential @xmath58 ,",
    "have been widely used to describe the macroscopic systems in everyday life .",
    "but unfortunately these intensive variables in thermodynamics can not be directly related to quantum operators . instead , in statistical mechanics @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "are introduced by hand as the lagrangian multipliers for the energy @xmath59 and the particle number @xmath60 respectively .",
    "the lack of interpretations for @xmath57 and @xmath58 at the microscopic level causes problems in nonequilibrium thermodynamics , where there is no generally accepted variational principle and then the temperature and chemical potential ( or more strictly the local temperature and local chemical potential ) can not be determined by the density matrix of the system . in other words",
    "there is no way of calculating @xmath57 and @xmath58 in a ness which is not the result of variational principle but the steady limit of the state evolving according to schrdinger equation .",
    "we contribute to solve this problem by providing a method of calculating the local temperature and chemical potential in a system according to its density matrix .    to avoid ambiguity we would like to emphasize that we do not define local temperature and chemical potential in arbitrary ness .",
    "in fact the definitions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 make sense only in systems where the local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are fulfilled . in other words , if we divide the system into small cells each cell must look like being in an equilibrium state , even if the whole system undergoes an irreversible process . in systems violating the local equilibrium arguments one would get arbitrary @xmath57 and @xmath58 by employing different measurement schemes which give unique result in an equilibrium system .",
    "as will be shown , an approach examining if the local equilibrium conditions are fulfilled naturally arises from our method .",
    "let us recall the process of using a mercury thermometer to measure the temperature of an object .",
    "we attach the thermometer closely to the target and wait for long enough until the temperatures of the target and the thermometer are the same .",
    "if the target is much larger than the thermometer , its temperature will not be changed during the equilibration process .",
    "then we read out the temperature according to the volume of mercury .",
    "this procedure suggests a general scheme of measuring local @xmath57 and @xmath58 of a system either in equilibrium or out of equilibrium by attaching an auxiliary apparatus to the region we want to measure . after waiting for a period longer than the equilibration time",
    ", the auxiliary apparatus will equilibrate if the conditions of local equilibrium are satisfied even if the whole system may be still out of equilibrium .",
    "then @xmath57 and @xmath58 are read out in the auxiliary apparatus according to their orthodox definitions in equilibrium .",
    "the auxiliary apparatus ( the `` thermometer '' ) should satisfy the following conditions : it must be very small so that it almost has no effect on the original state of the system ; and there is a simple relation between its temperature and some measurable property .",
    "obviously a single site is a suitable candidate of such auxiliary apparatus , since it is the smallest apparatus and its occupation number for fermions can be expressed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath58 are the energy level , the inverse of temperature and the chemical potential respectively .    our method bases on an ambitious assumption that a single site will equilibrate after attached to a large system .",
    "this is true only under special conditions , i.e. , the coupling between the site and the system is infinitesimal . consider an impurity site coupled to a fermi sea with chemical potential @xmath58 and temperature @xmath57 .",
    "this is just the single impurity anderson model without interaction .",
    "we switch on the coupling at time @xmath7 . given the energy level @xmath62 and the level width @xmath64 at the impurity site , in steady limit",
    "when time goes to infinity we find the occupation number to be @xmath65 only in weak coupling limit @xmath66 we have @xmath67 and then recover eq .",
    "[ occupation ] .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "[ occupation ] as @xmath68 then @xmath63 and @xmath58 can be easily determined by plotting @xmath69 with respect to @xmath62 .    if the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium is satisfied , according to the definition , the auxiliary site attached to the system must be in equilibrium and then eq .  [ linearrelation ] must be satisfied .",
    "conversely , if the linear relation in eq .",
    "[ linearrelation ] is satisfied at the attached site , we would make sure that the condition of local equilibrium is fulfilled .    in summary",
    ", we let a system evolve into a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "then we couple an auxiliary site to a local region of the system",
    ". the coupling strength should be infinitesimal .",
    "we switch on the coupling and calculate the occupation number @xmath70 at the site in steady limit .",
    "we adjust the energy level @xmath62 at the auxiliary site to obtain a series of pairs @xmath71 . if we can not fit eq .",
    "[ linearrelation ] to the series of data points , we conclude that the local region is not in equilibrium",
    ". if we succeed , we then determine the local temperature and chemical potential from the fitting parameters .",
    "this is our method of using one auxiliary site to calculate the local intensive thermodynamic parameters in a ness .",
    "next we give some comments on the possible applications of it . up to now solving the equation of motion is the only generally accepted way to reach a ness in mesoscopic transport . in this approach",
    "we usually assume a central conductor connected to at least two infinite reservoirs which are in equilibrium at initial time .",
    "the boundary conditions of the central conductor are given by the temperatures and chemical potentials of the reservoirs , which are assumed not to vary with time .",
    "the steady current through the central conductor can be calculated .",
    "the curve of current vs. voltage bias is plotted and compared with experimental results . however , sometimes we are more interested in the distribution of local chemical potentials inside the central scattering region , which can not be resolved from boundary conditions .",
    "our method provides a way to calculate the local @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the central conductor .",
    "the results can be compared with experiments .",
    "the local @xmath57 and @xmath58 are more important than reservoir temperature and chemical potential in the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics , where the gradients of intensive variables are called thermodynamic forces and are the reasons of flows .",
    "a chain connected to two reservoirs has been widely used to model the quantum point contact and the quantum wire fabricated in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "if the two reservoirs are in different chemical potentials , a current will be driven through the wire .",
    "this is the landauer - bttiker picture for mesoscopic transport . in ballistic transport regime",
    "when the wire is clean , there is only contact resistance in the device . in other words , there are sharp voltage drops at the interface between the reservoirs and the wire , while the voltage is equal everywhere inside the wire .    what is more interesting is a dirty wire , where we would expect the intrinsic resistance and a gradual drop of voltage through the wire . as in a macroscopic circuit , in a dirty wire the current can be treated as the result of the gradient of voltage inside the wire instead of the voltage bias of the reservoirs .",
    "the reservoirs are no more than the simulation of the voltage source in a circuit , while they are necessary for preparing the ness .",
    "a disordered chain is obtained by proposing random onsite potentials @xmath72 , where @xmath17 denotes the chain site . for simplicity",
    "we suppose that there is no correlation between @xmath72 at different sites . the average of @xmath72 is denoted as @xmath73 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath72 has a uniform distribution at the interval @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75 denotes the disorder strength . then the total hamiltonian including the two reservoirs is written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the annihilation operator of the electron in the lead",
    ", @xmath78 denotes the spin and @xmath79 denotes the left and right lead .",
    "the leads are in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and in chemical potential @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively . the operator @xmath84 with @xmath85 denotes the annihilation operator at site @xmath17 in the chain .",
    "the coupling strength between nearby sites in the chain is set to be @xmath30 , and that between the leads and the chain is set to be @xmath86 .    for general parameters ,",
    "the above hamiltonian is non - integrable due to the existence of coulomb interaction .",
    "several complicated numerical methods and approximation schemes have been developed for solving this model . for simplicity ,",
    "in this paper we will first solve the model without considering interaction by setting @xmath87 .",
    "then we consider the effect of the interaction in self - consistent mean field approximation . without interaction the electrons in different spin channels will transport independently and the spin index can be neglected .",
    "the simplified hamiltonian becomes @xmath88    in the left and right electron reservoirs we employ the momentum basis and assume a constant density of states denoted by @xmath89 . at the same time the reservoirs",
    "can also be simulated by the semi - infinite chains . in this sense",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ chainhamiltonian ] describes an infinite chain with emphasized central sites , similar to the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ hoppinghamiltonian ] .",
    "if we define @xmath90 as the energy unit ( like what we do in single impurity anderson model ) and set @xmath91 , the coupling strength between central sites has the same amplitude as that between nearby sites in reservoirs .",
    "this corresponds to a comparatively strong coupling between central sites . in following text",
    "we always set @xmath91 .",
    "one could also take different values of @xmath30 .",
    "but as @xmath92 the transmission spectrum has very sharp peaks , and one should be very careful when performing numerical integration routines .      the steady current and electron density at arbitrary site @xmath93 in the disordered chain",
    "are got by the keldysh technique , in which an adiabatic evolution is proposed with @xmath30 and @xmath86 switched on little by little . in this model",
    "adiabatically switching on the coupling makes no difference with a quench of coupling for the physical quantities in steady limit . in details",
    "we define the retarded green functions as @xmath94 and the lesser green functions as @xmath95 where @xmath96 denote the sites in the chain .",
    "the electron density and current at arbitrary site in the chain can be related to the simultaneous lesser green functions .",

    "this is contrary to the familiar phenomena in macroscopic circuits where we expect a monotonic drop of voltage through the resistance wire .",

    "such a chain will evolve into a nonequilibrium steady state after a quench of coupling between leads and the chain if the two leads are in different chemical potentials .",
