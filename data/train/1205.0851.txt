    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows two parties ( typically called alice and bob ) to generate a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "it performs the detection of any eavesdropping , and the security is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics , such as , noncloning theorem and heisenberg uncertainty ( see ref.@xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "qkd has attracted a great deal of research interest since bb84 qkd protocol was reported @xcite .    up to now ,",
    "there have already been several typical qkd protocols @xcite .",
    "for example , bb84 @xcite , b92 @xcite and sarg04 @xcite protocols are nonorthogonal single - photon protocols . e91 protocol @xcite , and bbm protocol @xcite are based on entangled photons . gg02",
    "protocol @xcite and distributed - phase - reference ( dpr ) protocol @xcite are continuous - variable protocols .",

    ", some qkd systems have already been commercialized @xcite .",
    "most of these qkd protocols rely on either polarization or phase of faint laser pulse as information carrier @xcite , the use of polarization encoding limits the degree of a photon to encode information . unlike the limited degree of freedom on polarization or phase states , orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states have attracted much attention since there is an infinite oam eigenstates in a single - photon @xcite . in 2007 , molina - terriza _ et al .",
    "have reviewed the use of oam of photons and discussed its potential for realizing high - dimensional quantum spaces @xcite . with the help of oam entanglement ,",
    "the group of kwiat has beaten the channel capacity limit for linear photonic superdense coding @xcite . in 2010 , leach _ et al .  demonstrated the quantum correlations in optical angle - orbital angular momentum variables .",
    "their experimental results of angular epr correlations have established that angular position and angular momentum are suitable variables for applications in current quantum information processing .",
    "they also experimentally demonstrated the violation of a bell inequality in two and eleventh dimensional oam state - space @xcite . _ _    apparently , the high capacity property of oam states results in their applications in qkd protocol @xcite .",
    "recently , gruneisen _ et al .",

    "oam states are used to design the high - dimensional mutually unbiased bases .",
    "they are in principle the extension of bb84 protocol . _ _    in this paper , we demonstrate a application for oam entanglement in quantum key distribution .",
    "we experimentally realize a large - alphabet qkd protocol using oam entanglement .",
    "this qkd protocol is quite different from the traditional one because the protocol is dependent on the oam entanglement , and the security is ensured by the property of entangled photon pairs and the special information modulation . with the protocol ,",
    "alice and bob can share keys without information reconciliation or privacy amplification .",
    "meanwhile , there is no classical channel in the protocol .",

    "our proposed qkd protocol is dependent on the the encoded states",
    ". we will first introduce it in this section .          the configuration considered for the protocol",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the pump source is a laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beam , which has zero orbital angular momentum .",
    "as oam is conserved , the two - photon states generated from bbo crystal by spdc process can be represented by@xcite @xmath5 where subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote signal ( alice s ) and idler ( bob s ) photons respectively , @xmath8 is the probability to generate an entangled photon pairs ( one photon in signal arm with oam @xmath9 and the other photon in idler arm with oam @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the oam eigenmode with mode number @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the plank constant divided by @xmath14 .",
    "the oam state of beam could then be changed by a phase filter , which is implemented by computer - controlled slms @xcite . here , the slms act as reconfigurable holograms .",
    "the modulated photons is collected via a single - mode fiber ( smf ) which is fed to a single photon detector .",
    "as only the oam eigenmodes @xmath15 couples into the fiber ( selected only for @xmath15 ) , a count in the detector indicates a detection of the state in which the slm was prepared for @xcite , where @xmath12 is the azimuthal index for oam states of photons@xcite . at last ,",
    "the outputs from the detectors are fed to a coincidence counter .",
    "experiments have justified that the generated two photons are in entanglement @xcite . using the modified pointcar sphere in an analogous fashion to polarization states",
    ", we use the sector state to encode symbol sequence in our qkd protocol .",
    "a sector sector state is defined as an equally weighted superposition of @xmath11 and @xmath16 with an arbitrary relative phase , which is represented by a point along the equator @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 relates to the orientation of the sector state in the modified pointcar sphere . actually , it is the angle between the sector state and the superposition state @xmath19 on the equator .    for an entangled photon pairs , the coincidence of one photon in sector state @xmath20 and",

    "we use these sector states to encode key sequences at bob s side and recover the symbol information from the coincidence rate at alice s side in our proposed qkd protocol .      as shown in the sketch of the setup in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the regions in the left box and the right box are alice s and bob s private places in our protocol , respectively . based on the configuration and the sector states shown in eq.([eq2 ] ) , the proposed qkd protocol is designed as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) with bbo crystal , alice generates entangled photon pairs , named signal photons and idler photons .",
    "alice keeps the signal photons for herself and sends the idler photons in the free - space channel to bob .",
    "\\(2 ) alice selects a sector state @xmath24 for the signal photons . here , the sector state is implemented by a computer - controlled @xmath25 with a special hologram in combination with smf on the signal photons .",
    "\\(3 ) at the same time , bob will encode his symbol sequence with his sector states .",
    "he also selects the sector states using @xmath26 with different phase holograms in combination with smf on the idler photons .",
    "the corresponding sector states are @xmath27 , which are codes for key elements@xmath28\",@xmath29\", ... ,@xmath30 \" , respectively . for a stream of key elements ,",
    "bob successively chooses the corresponding phase hologram and modulate them in his slm .",
    "for each key element , the corresponding modulation continues for a regular time interval @xmath31 for enough coincidence counting .",
    "of course , if the detectors have high enough detection efficiency , the regular time interval is not needed .",
    "\\(4 ) alice and bob transmit the modulated photons to the detectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 at alice s private place through a single mode fiber , respectively .",
    "\\(5 ) alice performs a coincidence measurement at her site . according to the different coincidence rates ,",
    "alice can retrieve the key sequences prepared by bob , so that they could share the same keys .",
    "note that the suitable modulations for bob in the _",
    "step , mean that in the _ 5th _ step , the corresponding coincidences expressed in eq.([eq3 ] ) are in distinct value regions .",
    "+ on the other hand , in the above @xmath29@xmath34 steps , alice and bob replace each other , then bob can recover keys sent by alice .",
    "in other words , if there are two such setups , alice and bob can send keys to each other .",
    "in order to testify this protocol by experiment , we setup an experimental system as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where a quasi continuous - wave , mode - locked @xmath35 laser is selected as the pump source .",
    "it is focused into a nonlinear crystal [ @xmath36-barium borate ( bbo ) ] , which can generate oam entangled photons through a frequency - degenerate type - i spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) process .",

    "it shows that they all obey gaussian distribution due to the gaussian noise of light sources . for key elements",

    "there are large enough gaps between arbitrary two nearest ranges . in other words ,",
    "the coincidence rates are in distinct value regions for different key elements .",
    "therefore , alice can judge the key element sent by bob according to which region the value of the coincidence rate belongs to , i.e. , alice can recover bob s keys . to test this",
    ", we let bob send another @xmath54 keys in experiments . we find that alice can fully recover bob s keys with the decision criteria .",
    "the corresponding partial experimental results are illustrated in table i.",
    "next , we will present our argument about the security of our qkd protocol from two aspects .",
    "one aspect is the security at the light way , and the other is the security against typical attacks .      in the protocol , alice generates the signal and idler photons from bbo crystal by spdc",
    ". then , alice modulates a fixed phase on the photons in order to select special oam states from the superposition of all oam states from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "the modulated photons travel in smf .",
    "last , alice take coincident measurement and extract the key from the measurements . as shown in the left box in fig.[fig1 ] , all these happen in alice s site . during all the procedures , eve can not access the signal photons .",
    "therefore , the signal photons are safe .    as shown in the right box in fig.[fig1 ] , bob modulate the idler photons in his site .",
    "eve can not access the idler photons during bob s modulation .",
    "they are safe at the above procedure .",
    "there are two chances for eve to access the idler photons when idler photons travel in public quantum channels . as displayed in fig.[fig1 ] , one chance is when the idler photons are transmitted from alice to bob in free spaces after alice generates the oam entangled photons . the other is when the idler photons are transmitted from bob s private place to alice s site in smf after bob modulates his information . for simplicity , we call the two chances the atb chance and the bta change , respectively . for the atb chance , at that time , the state carried by idler photons is a superposition of all oam states and does not have bob s information .",
    "furthermore , the idler photons are entangled with the signal photons .",
    "hence , even eve accesses these photons , she can not steal any bob s information from the idler photon .",
    "actually , alice could detect this action since she keep the other entangled photon .",
    "for the bta chance , there is only @xmath90 mode in the idler photons when they travel in smf , and @xmath90 mode has no key information in bob s encoding scheme . as entangled photon pairs",
    "are used in our protocol , bob s information can be recovered only using coincidence measurement between idler and signal photons . however",
    ", in our protocol , eve has no change to access signal photons , therefore , she also can not get any bob s key information at the procedure .    from all the above , we find that eve can not get bob s key information for all the light way .",
    "furthermore , the photon losses are unavoidable when photons travel in light ways nearly for all systems . here",
    "alice ( bob ) recovers a key sent by bob ( alice ) using coincidence measurements .",
    "the corresponding coincidence counting rate is a statistical result , therefore , the value of key can also be recovered even at the condition that small fraction of photons loss .      during qkd , there are many eavesdropping strategies for eve to get key information .",
    "the typical attacks are the intercept - resend ( ir ) attack , the man - in - the - middle ( mirm ) attack , and the photon - number - splitting ( pns ) attack , _ et .",
    "al_. eve can perform these attacks in the atb chance or the bta chance that mentioned above . in the following , we analysis them respectively .",
    "( i)the ir attack : eve measures out every signal emitted by alice and prepares a new one , depending on the result obtained , that is given to bob .",
    "as described above , in the atb and the bta chances , there is no difference between these idler photons .",
    "eve can intercept and measure them .",
    "however , there is no meaning for these measurement results .",
    "therefore , eve can not get any key information .",
    "as entangled photon pairs are used , the photon resent by eve will not satisfied with eq.([eq3 ] ) , so alice can detect the eavesdropper .",
    "( ii)the mirm attack : eve pretends to be bob to alice and simultaneously pretends to be alice to bob .",
    "qkd is vulnerable to this attack when used without authentication . in our protocol , alice ( bob ) can fully recover bob s ( alice s ) keys .",
    "they can also send deterministic keys to each other .",
    "if alice and bob have an initial shared secret , they can use these deterministic keys to authenticate each other .",
    "( iii)the pns attack : weak pulses may contain more than one photon and eve can simply keep some of the photons while letting the others go to bob . in our protocol , many photons in a regular time interval @xmath31 generate a qudit , which is equivalent to the many - photon case .",
    "eve can keep some of the photons while let the others go to bob during one @xmath31 .",
    "as entangled photon pairs and sector states are used , eve ca nt get key information carried by photons for she has no chance to perform coincidence measurements .",
    "in the paper , we have experimentally demonstrated the proposed large - alphabet qkd protocol with the entangled - photon in bob s side carrying trits of information .",
    "theoretically , bob uses oam as information carrier , so that he can encode more than one bits on his key sequences every time .",
    "we have analyzed the security of the protocol both from the light way and the typical attacks .",
    "the results show that the security of the protocol is ensured by the property of the entangled photons and the special fashion of the information modulation .",
    "the experimental results also show that alice could recover fully bob s information , so that alice and bob can share keys without information reconciliation or privacy amplification .    in principle , our qkd protocol have some advantages over the traditional qkd protocols .",
    "first , we use oam states as the information carrier , there is in principle no limit to how many bits encoded in each entangled photon pairs , which results in a potentially very large - alphabet size .",
    "second , we utilize the entangled photons and the special fashion of the information modulation in the protocol , and recover the key sequences by coincidence counting . since one photon is always kept in alice s private space , eve has no way to eavesdrop the key sequences during the protocol steps .",
    "all these assure the security of our proposed protocol .",
    "in addition , in the protocol , alice and bob do not need any classical communications for the key recovery , which makes the protocol efficient and simple .    in practice",
    ", the bits encoded in each entangled photon pairs is determined by the light source properties , noise intensity and the photon detection to distinguish the corresponding coincidences expressed in eq.([eq3 ] ) .",
    "experimentally , we could recover four - based keys with the distinct coincidences if we set the regular time interval @xmath91 so that more than @xmath53 entangled photon pairs could be produced during the time interval .",
    "hence , we got @xmath34 four - based keys per second with @xmath92 bits per second ( bps ) at this case .",
    "currently , the coincidence rate is in the order @xmath93 to @xmath94 counts per second using different entangled photon sources , and the corresponding key generation rates are in the order @xmath92 to @xmath95 bps with our qkd .",
    "this is slower than qkd technologies based on weak coherent pulses .",
    "but , with the development of techniques about the photon detection and the generation of entangled photon pairs , the key generation rate will be improved greatly .    generally , the practical implementing of qkd based on oam states will confront two big problems , such as , decoherence by atmospheric turbulence and photon losses in quantum channel .",
    "theoretically and experimentally , these two problems have been attracted a lot of attention @xcite , and some solutions have been proposed to overcome these problems @xcite .    finally ,",
    "as the keys can be recovered completely , the protocol can also be used to quantum authentication , quantum direct communication @xcite and so on .",
