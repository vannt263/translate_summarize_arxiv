    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xmath3  @xcite , with its accompanying axion  @xcite , continues to be the most attractive solution to the strong cp problem in qcd . at present axions",
    "are of great interest not only in theoretical aspects of elementary particle physics , but in some astrophysical and cosmological applications as well  @xcite .",
    "although the original axion is excluded experimentally , modified pq models with very light and weakly coupled `` invisible '' axions are still tenable  @xcite .",
    "invisible axion models are classified into two types depending on whether or not they have a direct coupling to leptons . in ksvz model",
    "@xcite axions have only induced coupling to leptons . in dfsz model",
    "@xcite axions couple to leptons at tree level .    at present axions",
    "are strongly constrained by astrophysical and cosmological considerations which leave a rather narrow window  @xcite : @xmath4 in which they can exist and provide a significant fraction or all of the cosmic dark matter .",
    "the extremely small value of the axion mass @xmath5 and , consequently , a gigantic axion lifetime in vacuum : @xmath6 does not leave any hope to observe @xmath7 decay in laboratory conditions .    it is known that an external electromagnetic field can affect substantially decays of very light , weakly interacting particles .",
    "the examples of the strong catalyzing influence of the field on processes allowed in vacuum are radiative decays of the massive neutrino @xmath8  @xcite and the axion @xmath7",
    "one of the results obtained in  @xcite is that the external field removes the main suppression caused by the smallness of the decaying particle mass . to illustrate this for @xmath7 decay  @xcite we give the comparison of the decay probability @xmath9 induced by the field with the vacuum one @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is some function of the field dynamical parameter .",
    "another special feature of the external field influence is that the field can open novel channels forbidden in vacuum .",
    "in particular , the axion decay into electron - positron pair @xmath0 is opened due to a specific kinematics of charged particles in the field .",
    "we have studied this decay in two classes of invisible axion models  @xcite .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the axion lifetime in dfsz model is reduced to @xmath13  s in the case of the decaying axion energy @xmath14  mev in the magnetic field of strength @xmath15",
    "g while for ksvz axions the lifetime becomes even of order seconds  @xcite for the above mentioned parameters .",
    "however considering axions effects in astrophysical and cosmological environments it is important to take into account not only the magnetic field influence , as it was done in  @xcite , but the plasma one as well .",
    "the most physically realistic situation is that when from both components of the active medium the plasma dominates .",
    "so , the magnetic field @xmath16 is relatively weak @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron chemical potential and temperature , respectively ) and a great number of the landau levels is excited .",
    "whereas the condition @xmath20 is fulfilled , the magnetic filed is strong enough , @xmath21 , in comparison with the known schwinger value @xmath22  g. possible mechanisms to generate fields as strong as @xmath23  g in astrophysical objects  @xcite and in the early universe  @xcite are widely discussed .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the field - induced axion decay into electron - positron pair @xmath0 in the plasma .",
    "the axion decay @xmath24 is described by two diagrams in fig .  [",
    "fig : agee - sum ] where solid double lines imply the influence of the magnetic field on the electron wave functions and undulating double lines imply the influence of medium on the photon propagator .",
    "the diagram  ( a ) describes this process in the model  @xcite with a direct axion - fermion coupling : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a dimensionless coupling constant ; @xmath27 is the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale ; @xmath28 is a model - dependent factor ; @xmath29 is the fermion mass ( electron in our case ) ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fermion and axion fields , respectively .",
    "the diagram  ( b ) describes the decay via a photon intermediate state .",
    "the effective axion - photon coupling can be presented in the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the four potential of the quantized electromagnetic field , @xmath34 is the dual external field tensor ; @xmath35 is an effective coupling in the presence of the magnetic field with the dimension @xmath36",
    "@xcite : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 corresponds to the well - known @xmath39 coupling in vacuum ( diagram  ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : ag - eff ] ) with a constant @xmath40  @xcite , where @xmath41 is the model - dependent parameter .",
    "the second term in  ( [ eq : gag1 ] ) is the field - induced contribution to the effective coupling @xmath35 which comes from a diagram  ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : ag - eff ] : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the hardy - stokes function and @xmath44 is the dynamic parameter : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the elementary charge , @xmath48 is a relative electric charge of a loop fermion ; @xmath49 is the four - momentum of the axion .",
    "as it was pointed in  @xcite this term gives a contribution comparable with @xmath38 for the fermions with @xmath50 only .",
    "the decay probability of particles in the magnetic field depends on invariant field parameters . in a general case of arbitrary values of particles energies and the magnetic field strength two independent field invariants @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath52 exist .",
    "therefore the decay probability is a function of these parameters . in the case of a relatively weak magnetic field ,",
    "when a great number of the landau levels is excited , and ultrarelativistic particles the invariant @xmath52 occurs the largest one .",
    "so , the decay probability depends actually on the dynamic parameter @xmath44  ( [ eq : chi ] ) only .",
    "it means that we can perform calculations in a crossed field ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) with zeroth field invariants @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath0 decay corresponding to the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : agee - sum ] is a sum : @xmath57 where @xmath58 corresponds the diagram  ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : agee - sum ] : @xmath59 and @xmath60 describes the contribution from the diagram  ( b ) : @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is the exact solution of the dirac equation in the external crossed field  @xcite ; @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the quasi - momenta of final electron and positron ( @xmath65 ) ; @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the dirac @xmath68-matrices .",
    "the condition of the relative weakness of the magnetic field , @xmath69 , means that from both components of the active medium the plasma determines basically the properties of the photon propagator @xmath70 .",
    "the propagator can be presented as a sum of transverse and longitudinal parts : @xmath71 here , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the transverse and longitudinal eigenvalues of the polarization operator ; @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 denote the transverse and longitudinal photon polarization vectors : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the four - velocity of medium .",
    "being integrated over the variable @xmath79 the matrix element  ( [ eq : s1 ] ) is : @xmath80 \\ ; u ( - p ' ) , \\nonumber \\\\ u^2 & = & - \\frac{e^2 a^2}{m_e^2 } , \\qquad    z = \\left ( \\frac{\\chi_a}{2 \\chi \\chi ' } \\right ) ^{1/3 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\chi^2 & = & \\frac{e^2 ( p f f p)}{m_e^6 } , \\qquad   { \\chi'}^2 = \\frac{e^2 ( p ' f f p')}{m_e^6 } , \\qquad   % \\nonumber \\\\ \\chi_a^2 = \\frac{e^2 ( q f f q)}{m_e^6 }",
    ".    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the crossed field tensor ; @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the perpendicular to @xmath85 component ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the bispinor @xmath87 , which is normalized by the condition @xmath88 , satisfies the dirac equation for the free electron @xmath89 .",
    "finally , @xmath90 is the airy function : @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "after integration over the phase space of the @xmath93 pair the decay probability is : @xmath94 where the variable @xmath95 is the relative electron energy ; @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the fermi - dirac distributions of electrons and positrons , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath98 have a meaning of the average values of suppressing statistical factors and are , in general case , inside the interval @xmath99 .    the second term in  ( [ eq : prob - tot ] ) describes the contribution of the longitudinal plasmon intermediate state only and has a resonant character at a particular energy of the decaying axion @xmath100 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the axion and the longitudinal plasmon dispersion relations always cross for a certain wave - number @xmath101 .",
    "the contribution of the transverse plasmon to the decay probability of @xmath102 in the ultrarelativistic case is negligibly small .",
    "the dimensionless resonance width @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob - tot ] ) is : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total width of the longitudinal plasmon ; @xmath105 is the renormalization factor of the longitudinal plasmon wave - function : @xmath106 note that without the external field the plasmon decay into neutrino pair is kinematically allowed only . in the presence of the strong magnetic field ( @xmath107 ) the main contribution to the width @xmath104",
    "is determined by the process of the longitudinal plasmon absorption @xmath108  @xcite which becomes possible in this kinematical region also .",
    "below we give the expressions for @xmath109 and @xmath68 in two cases : i ) degenerate plasma ( @xmath110 ) @xmath111 ii ) nondegenerate hot plasma ( @xmath112 ) @xmath113 considering possible applications of the result to cosmology we estimate the axion lifetime in a hot plasma . under the early universe conditions the hot plasma is nondegenerate one and the medium parameters @xmath98 are inside the interval @xmath114 . with @xmath109 and @xmath68  ( [ eq : nondegen ] ) we obtain the following estimation for the axion lifetime ( diagram  ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : agee - sum ] ) in the resonance region : @xmath115 it is interesting to compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : time - ksvz ] ) with the axion lifetime without taking into account the resonant contribution via plasmon @xmath116    the expressions  ( [ eq : time - ksvz ] ) and  ( [ eq : time - dfsz ] ) demonstrate the strong catalyzing influence of medium , the plasma and the magnetic field , on the axion decay .",
    "nevertheless , the axion lifetime is determined by the axion decay via the longitudinal plasmon in both invisible axion models  @xcite .",
