    "spins that are aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector ( as expected under the action of external torques provided by a circumbinary accretion flow , see @xcite ) yield recoil velocities below @xmath32 , while the configuration producing the maximum recoil kick corresponds to equal - mass maximally rotating holes with anti - aligned spins oriented parallel to the orbital plane , @xmath33 @xcite .",

    "galaxy mergers are also a leading mechanism for supplying gas to their nuclear mbhs , and a recoiling hole can retain the inner parts of its accretion disk , providing fuel for a continuing luminous phase along its trajectory .",
    "two possible observational manifestations of gravitational - radiation ejection have then been suggested : ( 1 ) spatially offset active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity @xcite ; and ( 2 ) broad emission lines that are substantially shifted in velocity relative to the narrow - line gas left behind @xcite .",
    "the effect of gravitational wave recoil in the mass buildup of mbhs is more prominent at high redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "observational evidence of recoiling mbhs is scarce and highly controversial .",

    "however , several authors have challenged this hypothesis , proposing that the object is a mbh binary @xcite or an interacting galaxy pair @xcite .",
    "the observability of recoiling mbhs depends sensitively on their dynamics in galaxy halos .",
    "the radial orbit of a recoiling hole in a spherically symmetric potential was first studied analytically by @xcite and numerically by @xcite .",
    "these early studies showed that large kicks ( @xmath36 ) can displace mbhs tens of kiloparsecs away from the center of a milky way - sized stellar bulge and that , after the kick , the mbh undergoes several oscillations before decaying back to the bottom of the potential .",
    "most of the orbital energy is lost during the mbh passages through the center , where dynamical friction is most efficient : the cuspy central stellar density profile is flattened by the heating effect of dynamical friction , and the mbh decay timescale correspondingly lengthened .",
    "@xcite have recently substantiated these results by performing direct summation @xmath0-body simulations of mbh recoil in spherical galaxies with binary - depleted cores .",
    "they found that initially the mbh loses its energy due to dynamical friction as predicted by chandrasekhar s theory @xcite .",

    "we show that , owing to departures from axisymmetry in the dark matter potential , the orbit of the hole is highly non - radial , resulting in a significantly increased decay timescale compared to a spherical halo .",
    "the simulations are used to construct a more realistic semi - analytic model of the motion of the mbh in a time - varying triaxial navarro ",
    "white ( nfw ) halo plus a fixed isothermal stellar bulge , where the dynamical friction force is calculated directly from the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "such a model should offer a more realistic picture of the dynamics of kicked mbhs in situations where gas drag , friction by disk stars , and the heating effect of the returning hole on the central cusp are all negligible .",
    "the vl - i simulation was performed with pkdgrav ( stadel 2001 ) a cosmological tree code that includes gravitational multipoles up to hexa - decapole order to reach high accuracy in the force calculation .",

    "the time - stepping criterion is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the local acceleration .",
    "the resolution of vl - i allows us to adopt the mass of sgra * , @xmath54 @xcite , for the central mbh particle : this implies a mbh - to - particle mass ratio of 175 , enough to accurately reproduce the effect of dynamical friction .",

    "2006 ) . as detailed in @xcite , we approximate the shape of the vl - i host potential by diagonalizing the unweighted kinetic energy tensor @xmath66 where @xmath67 is related to the potential energy tensor @xmath68 through the tensor virial theorem @xmath69 here , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we assume @xmath72 so that the eigenvectors of @xmath67 reflect the principal axes of the potential ellipsoid .",
    "the latter is significantly rounder than the mass distribution , and neither its shape nor orientation varies much with the radius @xcite .",
    "the degree of triaxiality of the halo potential , @xmath73 , is given by @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the time - dependent intermediate - to - major and minor - to - major axis ratios , respectively ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "a halo is said to be oblate for @xmath78 , triaxial for @xmath79 , and prolate for @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ shapes ] shows the evolution of the potential shape parameters with redshift at different radii . in the inner regions the axis ratios remain approximately constant after around @xmath81 , but",
    "before @xmath82 there are significant changes in the outer regions , as the halo becomes more spherical .",
    "the triaxiality parameter remains mostly in the prolate regime ( @xmath83 ) in the inner regions , while in the outer halo evolves from prolate at @xmath84 to triaxial or slightly oblate at @xmath85 , to back to prolate at later times .",
    "note that the vl - i host accretes some fairly massive subhalos between @xmath82 and @xmath86 .",
    "dynamical friction causes these subhalos to spiral in to the center over a few orbits , and they lose most of their mass in this process .",
    "the associated redistribution of material probably contributes to the observed shape adjustments .",
    "we placed the mbh particle at the position of the densest point of the main vl - i halo at an initial redshift @xmath87 , 300 myr after the last major merger . at this epoch",
    "the host has @xmath88 and @xmath89 kpc .",
    "the kick was oriented at an angle of 20@xmath90 to the minor axis of the host halo at @xmath91 .",
    "the mbh orbit was tracked at every time step in our simulations , and its position and velocity were measured with respect to the central position and center of mass velocity , respectively . the five halo@xmath92mbh runs corresponding to kick velocities @xmath93 = 80 , 120 , 200 , 300 , and 400 @xmath3 and labeled vl080 to vl400 were evolved for 1.15 gyr ( i.e. , until a final redshift @xmath49 ) .",
    "all kick velocities are below the escape speed at @xmath91 , @xmath94 .",
    "each run consumed 13,000 cpu hours on the pleiades supercomputer cluster at ucsc , and followed the mbh for 10,000 time steps .",
    "the resulting trajectories are shown in figure  [ all_runs ] , the orbits parameters are listed in table 2 , and the three - dimensional rendering of the orbits in simulations vl120 , vl200 , and vl300 are shown in figure  [ orb3d ] .",
    "only @xmath95 trajectories actually sample the outer halo with pericenter distances @xmath96 kpc , and only @xmath97 trajectories return within 0.5 kpc from the center during the duration of the simulation .",
    "the motion of the hole remains nearly rectilinear for one or two oscillations only , as the @xmath98- and @xmath99-components of its orbit become rapidly important due to asphericities in the halo potential .",
    "this increases the mbh decay timescale compared to a spherical model , as we show below .",
    "dynamical friction has only a weak effect on the maximum displacement of the mbh .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ orb3d ] ( right top panel ) , where a sixth simulation was carried out with the recoiling hole treated as a massless test particle of initial kick velocity @xmath100 .",
    "a comparison with vl080 shows how , for the first 2 - 3 oscillations , dynamical friction does not strongly influence the motion of the hole , and the maximum displacement is similar to that of the energy - conserving orbit .",
    "it is only at later times that the effect of friction sets in , reducing the amplitude and period of the oscillations and bringing the hole back to the center .",
    "note how , for @xmath101 , and because of the aspheric nature of the halo , the mbh spends most of its time @xmath102 kpc away from the center and does not have a significant dynamical heating effect on the dark matter distribution in the nucleus .",
    "it is interesting at this stage to compare the results of our numerical simulations with a semi - analytic model of the motion of a recoiling mbh in an nfw halo .",
    "such a model will allow us to follow the trajectory of a recoiling black hole for a hubble time or until it returns to the center .",
    "we define the return time , @xmath103 , as the time it takes for the mbh to decay to within @xmath104 pc of the center of the halo with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the total energy ( kinetic + potential ) of the mbh and @xmath107 is its initial energy . the energy condition is set to ensure that the mbh is not simply going through a close periastron passage .",
    "we start by approximating the potential as spherically symmetric and static , with the @xmath45 host halo parameters given in table 1 . under these assumptions",

    "the proper definition of the coulomb logarithm , @xmath110 , has been extensively debated .",

    "several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that a dynamically varying value for @xmath110 provides a better estimate of dynamical friction than a constant value when compared to @xmath0-body simulations . here",

    "we use @xmath118 and set @xmath119 , the radius of influence of the mbh .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath120 for an nfw profile can be solved numerically from the jeans equation or approximated analytically for @xmath56 between 0.01 and 100 by the function @xcite @xmath121 we integrate the equation of motion numerically using an adaptive adams - bashforth - moulton integration scheme .",
    "the resulting radial orbits for kick velocities @xmath122 , and @xmath32 are shown in figure  [ orbits_both ] ( left panels ) .",
    "the decay timescale of a recoiling hole in a spherical potential is significantly shorter compared to the results of @xmath0-body simulations , mainly because of the efficiency of dynamical friction during each passage through the nuclear regions . in the @xmath123 case , for example",
    ", the mbh is back to the center after 0.6 gyr in the spherical case , while it is still wandering close to @xmath124 in the simulations .",
    "a self - consistent estimate of the decay timescale must include the flattening of the cuspy central density profile by the oscillating hole .",
    "such a cumulative heating effect , however , is negligible in this case , since due to the triaxiality of the potential the mbh does not affect the central density and velocity dispersion profiles dramatically .",
    "the next - order approximation is to model the motion of the recoiling hole in a triaxial , dynamically evolving nfw dark matter halo , using the vl - i halo parameters given in table 1 and the potential shape parameters plotted in figure [ shapes ] .",

    "a correct estimate of the velocity dispersion as a function of radius and redshift is crucial in the calculation of dynamical friction . here , we take the following approach .",
    "first , we measure the  true \" shape and orientation of the local velocity dispersion ellipsoids directly from the vl - i simulation ( model a ; see section  [ local_quantities ] for details ) .",

    "the mbh receives a kick velocity of @xmath2 = 80 , 120 , 200 , 300 , and 400 @xmath3 following the coalescence of its progenitor binary , and moves within the  live \" host subject only to gravity and dynamical friction against the dark matter background .",
    "we have used these calculations to build realistic semi - analytic models of the hole s trajectory in a time - varying triaxial nfw potential , where the dynamical friction force is calculated directly from the velocity dispersion tensor , and in a two - component triaxial halo+spherical bulge model .",
    "the latter case should offer a more realistic picture of the dynamics of kicked mbhs in situations where gas drag , friction by disk stars , and the heating effect of the returning hole on the central cusp are all negligible .",
    "our results on the trajectories of recoiling mbhs can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "owing to asphericities in the dark matter potential , the black hole s orbits are highly non - radial , resulting in a significantly increased decay timescale compared to the spherical case .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with earlier results by @xcite .",
    "2 .   in a triaxial nfw halo return timescales to the center exceed 5 gyr already for @xmath149 , and are longer than the hubble time for @xmath198 .",
    "3 .   in a triaxial halo+spherical bulge potential ,",
    "decay timescales are much shorter than in the bulgeless case .",
    "for kick velocities @xmath199 , dynamical friction against bulge stars now efficiently damp the motion of the mbh already on the first outward trajectory , and reduces the decay timescale to less than 2 gyr .",
    "for recoil velocities @xmath200 the mbh does not return to the center of its host within a hubble time . recoling black holes do not leave the bulge and remain within a few tens of parsecs from the center for @xmath193 .",
    "a kicked mbh can retain the inner parts of its accretion disk , providing fuel for a continuing luminous phase along its trajectory .",
    "let us assume all recoiling holes accrete at a fraction @xmath201 of the eddington rate @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "the duration of the luminous phase depends on the amount of disk material out to the radius @xmath204 that is carried by the hole . in the case of an @xmath205-disk ,",
    "this is given by ( loeb 2007 ) @xmath206 where @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 is the viscosity parameter . the condition @xmath211 then requires @xmath212 for lower kick velocities @xmath213 , corresponding to an agn lifetime of @xmath214 . a recoiling hole / disk system with ( @xmath215 could then be shining for half a gigayear as an off - center quasar over a large fraction of its  wandering \" phase .",
    "thus , cases where the recoil kick is large enough to launch the mbh into the triaxial halo are favorable for the detection of off - nuclear quasars .",
    "however , if the mbh is initially embedded in a gas - rich environment , gas drag may damp its motion significantly @xcite , even for moderate kicks , lowering the detection probability .",
    "furthermore , the spins of both black holes in a mbh binary tend to align due to torques induced by the surrounding gas , reducing the kick velocity to @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "the motion of a recoiling mbh in a gas - rich merger including a stellar and dark matter component will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
