    "in his classic paper , griffiths@xcite found that the magnetization of the site - diluted classical ising ferromagnet exhibits , _ in the paramagnetic phase _ , an essential singularity as a function of external magnetic field @xmath8 , at @xmath9 .",
    "the singularity occurs for a range of temperatures t above the actual critical temperature @xmath10 of the system , but below the critical temperature of the parent uniform ferromagnet .",
    "this effect , known as the griffiths singularity , arises as a result of fluctuations in the distribution of the disorder in models with quenched randomness .",
    "clusters which are coupled to each other more strongly than the average appear locally ordered , even though the system as a whole is still in the disordered phase .",
    "if these ( usually rare ) `` griffiths clusters '' occur with sufficiently large probability , their effects can dominate the properties of the average system .",
    "griffiths singularities in the static properties of classical site- or bond - diluted random spin systems are quite weak .",
    "consequently , they have not yet been observed in actual experiments or in high precision computer simulations@xcite .",
    "there have also been studies of the dynamic effects of griffiths clusters in classical spin systems .",
    "such regions lead to non - exponential relaxation of the temporal spin correlation function in the paramagnetic phase , at temperatures below the @xmath10 of the pure system .",
    "analytical bounds for the diluted ferromagnet@xcite and spin glass@xcite suggest a relaxation that is slower than not only an exponential in time @xmath11 , but also an exponential in any power of @xmath11 ; however , the bound decays faster than any power of @xmath11 .",
    "non - exponential relaxation is observed in monte carlo simulations of the symmetric @xmath12 ising spin glass model@xcite , though the functional form appears to fit a stretched exponential , rather than the asymptotic form obtained from the analytic considerations of dynamic griffiths singularities@xcite .",
    "thus , it is not clear to what extent the observed non - exponential relaxation is related to the rare unfrustrated clusters considered in formulating the analytical bounds , nor is there a well - formed picture of the dominant dynamic griffiths singularities in these systems .    for random quantum systems",
    "the situation is very different , as can be seen from the work of mccoy@xcite , and as has been recently emphasized by fisher@xcite . in quantum systems the dynamics",
    "are inextricably linked to statics , so static and dynamic griffiths singularities are essentially the same phenomenon .",
    "further , griffiths singularities are greatly enhanced by quantum fluctuations , leading to many cases where system properties are dominated by rare regions of the sample .",
    "thus , for example , the magnetic susceptibility in insulating random antiferromagnets both in one dimensional compounds such as tcnq salts ( e.g. qn(tcnq)@xmath13)@xcite and in three dimensional lightly doped semiconductors ( e.g. silicon doped with phosphorus@xcite or boron@xcite ) is dominated at low temperatures by the divergent contribution from rare , weakly coupled spins .",
    "various theoretical studies justifying the observed divergent form exist , based on models of random quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnets with short range interactions@xcite .",
    "similar explanations have also been suggested for divergent susceptibilities for dimerized spin-1/2 chains with randomness@xcite , and for amorphous metallic systems with magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "the random quantum ising model in a transverse field , which we study here , undergoes a @xmath5 quantum phase transition from a spin - glass ordered phase at low field , to a disordered phase at high field .",
    "while this is true in all dimensions at @xmath5 , most is known about the model in @xmath1@xcite . in this case ,",
    "griffiths singularities dominate both the disordered phase as well as the critical region . among the more spectacular results",
    "is the demonstration@xcite ( more than 25 years ago ) that the average linear magnetic susceptibility diverges in the disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase as the transverse field is reduced from a large value , well before the transition to the ordered phase .",
    "further , the dynamical exponent , @xmath14 , characterizing the scaling of the temporal and spatial correlation lengths at the phase transition , is found to be infinite ( the correlation time scales exponentially with the spatial correlation length ) .",
    "as shown by fisher@xcite , there is a significant difference between average and typical spin - spin correlation functions , and the former are dominated by griffiths singularities coming from rare events .",
    "note that for the linear chain ( @xmath1 ) there is no frustration even when the exchanges are of random sign .",
    "the @xmath1 transverse - field ising spin glass is simply mapped onto an equivalent random - exchange ferromagnet by a variable change that interchanges the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states at the appropriate sites .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "effects of griffiths singularities are expected on general grounds to be weaker for both the spin glass and the random ferromagnet .",
    "however , as argued by thill and huse@xcite , divergences due to griffiths singularities do survive for any finite @xmath17 , although they may be confined to very high - order susceptibilities .",
    "it is the quenched disorder that produces the griffiths singularities , so the frustration present in the spin glass is not essential to the phenomenon .",
    "however , the spin glass is in a certain sense the simplest system to study , since there is a standard no - parameter model , namely the edwards - anderson model with gaussian - distributed exchange couplings with variance one and mean zero .",
    "a model random ferromagnet has an additional parameter to set , namely the strength of the random variations in the exchanges relative to the mean exchange .",
    "although it would be interesting to also study the random ferromagnet , here we confine our attention to the spin glass .",
    "numerical simulations of the quantum ising spin glass in @xmath2@xcite as well as in @xmath3@xcite suggest that in both cases , the scaling at the @xmath5 quantum phase transition is characterized by a finite dynamical exponent ( so that the relation between temporal and spatial correlation lengths is of the conventional power - law type ) .",
    "however , the average linear susceptibility is found to be divergent@xcite at the phase transition in @xmath2 ( where the spin - glass ordered phase , and hence the transition occurs only at @xmath5 ) , whereas in @xmath3 , which has a transition both at @xmath5 and at nonzero t , the average linear susceptibility remains finite at the transition@xcite .",
    "the non - linear susceptibility is found to be divergent ( as expected ) in both cases ; however , the exponent characterizing the divergence is found to be considerably larger than the one obtained in experiments on a related system , the diluted , dipolar coupled , ising system , liho@xmath18y@xmath19f@xmath20@xcite .",
    "the present work has thus been motivated on a number of grounds .",
    "firstly , it would be of interest to see whether the strong effects of griffiths singularities seen in @xmath1 are a purely one - dimensional phenomenon ( as many unusual properties turn out to be ) , or are more general .",
    "secondly , a systematic study of griffiths singularities in higher dimensions would help ascertain their importance in quantum systems without any theoretical assumptions or biases .",
    "( previous studies in higher dimensions are based on the applicability of certain schemes - e.g. phenomenological arguments in the case of thill and huse@xcite , and convergence of perturbative renormalization schemes in the case of quantum antiferromagnets@xcite ) . finally , it would be of interest to investigate the possibility that strong griffiths singularities may be complicating the comparison between numerical simulations on the transverse ising spin glass and the experiments on the diluted dipolar system . here",
    "we study both the two- and three - dimensional quantum ising spin glass ; the accompanying paper by rieger and young@xcite is a substantially more thorough study of the two - dimensional case .",
    "the previous simulation studies of these systems@xcite focussed on the quantum phase transition ; here , to study the quantum griffiths singularities , we instead focus on the paramagnetic phase .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review the model , as well as the basic concepts concerning the effect of rare strongly - coupled clusters . in the latter discussion ,",
    "we follow the description of thill and huse@xcite .",
    "the model we study is the quantum ising spin glass in a transverse field , which is governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath21 where @xmath22 s are the pauli spin matrices representing the quantum mechanical spin-1/2 at site @xmath23 , and the exchange interactions @xmath24 between the nearest neighbors on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice are taken to be independent quenched random variables with a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance unity .",
    "the second term represents the coupling to a transverse field @xmath7 applied along the @xmath25-axis .",
    "the ground state of the above model , in any dimension @xmath26 , undergoes a phase transition at @xmath27 from a spin - glass ordered state at low field , to a disordered paramagnetic state at high field . for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the lower critical dimension for the classical ising spin glass ( currently believed to be between 2 and 3)@xcite , such a transition exists also at finite temperature ( see figure 1 ) , close enough",
    "to which the critical behavior is that of the classical model ; the quantum behavior is recovered in the @xmath0 limit .    as explained in previous work@xcite , the quantum mechanical hamiltonian ( 1 ) above",
    "may be approximately mapped onto an equivalent classical hamiltonian in @xmath30 dimensions given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are classical ising variables taking on the values @xmath33 , with roman indices referring to sites on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice composed of the space dimensions of the original quantum mechanical hamiltonian , and the index @xmath34 referring to the @xmath30-th imaginary time dimension obtained by transforming the quantum hamiltonian to a path integral .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 2 ) has nearest - neighbor _ ferromagnetic _ couplings in the imaginary time direction , and further the random couplings in the @xmath17 space dimensions are independent of @xmath34 .",
    "our simulations are done on the classical model of eq .",
    "( 2 ) on hypercubic lattices in ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions for a range of spatial sizes l and `` time '' sizes @xmath35 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in both spatial and imaginary time directions . in the transformation to the classical hamiltonian",
    ", the length @xmath35 corresponds to the inverse temperature of the quantum hamiltonian ( so @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath36 ) , and the temperature @xmath37 of the classical statistical mechanical problem corresponds to the strength of the transverse field , @xmath7 , with higher @xmath37 corresponding to larger @xmath7 .",

    "( also shown are the variables of the equivalent classical model ) .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath41 remains slightly larger than @xmath4 for @xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 shows the schematic phase diagram of the quantum mechanical model for @xmath38 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the lower critical dimension of the classical short range ising spin glass , currently believed to be between @xmath39 and @xmath40@xcite .",

    "next , we examine the effect of griffiths singularities in quantum ising spin - glass systems , following thill and huse@xcite . consider a rare strongly - coupled or less - frustrated cluster ( at @xmath5 ) with local critical transverse field @xmath43 higher than the critical @xmath4 of the whole system .",
    "the probability of finding such a cluster with linear length scale @xmath44 is exponentially small in the cluster volume : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a nonnegative constant depending continuously on the difference between @xmath43 and @xmath4 ; @xmath46 vanishes only for @xmath47 .",
    "we are interested in the disordered phase where the applied transverse field @xmath48 , but @xmath49 such that the rare cluster is locally ordered .",
    "this situation may be examined in terms of the equivalent classical spin system ( 2 ) .",
    "it is easily seen that the anomalous bond configuration of the rare cluster in the spatial hyperplane is replicated along the imaginary time direction .",
    "thus we have a one dimensional chain of special spins in this classical spin system .",
    "as argued by thill and huse@xcite , this cluster can be modeled by a 1d ising model at @xmath50 , with the ising spins @xmath51 describing the two degenerate classical ordered states that the cluster flips between as @xmath34 varies .",
    "the ferromagnetic exchange coupling , @xmath52 , between adjacent ising spins along the imaginary time direction is the action to flip the cluster and is proportional to the droplet volume in the spatial hyperplane : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 depends continuously on the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath43 and is positive for @xmath55 when the cluster is ordered . as usual , the correlation length of this 1d ising model along the imaginary time direction , @xmath56 , is proportional to @xmath57 , thus grows _ exponentially _ with the cluster volume @xmath44 : @xmath58 as a consequence , the probability of a spin being in a cluster with @xmath43 and imaginary time correlation length greater than @xmath56 varies as @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "the exponent @xmath61 depends on both @xmath7 and @xmath43 . for a given transverse field",
    "@xmath7 the clusters that are most likely to produce large correlations will be those with the @xmath43 that minimizes this exponent ; let us call the minimum value @xmath62 .",
    "it is this exponent @xmath62 that characterizes the tail of the distribution of strongly - coupled clusters that produce griffiths singularity effects .",
    "in particular , we will be studying the distribution of the local nonlinear susceptibility , which is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "thus the probability of a spin having a local nonlinear susceptibility larger than @xmath25 falls off as @xmath64 , for large @xmath25 .",
    "we do observe such a power - law tail of the distribution in our simulations , with the exponent varying continuously with @xmath7 , as expected .",
    "let us compare the dynamic griffiths singularities for the @xmath5 quantum random paramagnetic phase and the classical paramagnetic phase at @xmath65 .",
    "in both cases the probability of a locally - ordered cluster is exponential in the volume of the cluster as in ( 4 ) .",
    "however , at @xmath65 a cluster can flip by thermal activation as well as by quantum tunnelling .",
    "the free energy barrier for thermally - activated flipping is at most proportional to the cross - section of the cluster , so the correlation time grows no faster than @xmath66 , ( @xmath67 is another constant ) in contrast to the result ( 5 ) for @xmath5 .",
    "the large - time tail of the resulting distribution of local relaxation times decays faster than any power of time .",
    "thus the power - law tails discussed above are unique to the @xmath5 quantum case where the griffiths clusters can flip only by quantum tunnelling .",
    "in the disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase , griffiths singularities arise as a result of clusters which have finite correlation in space and rare sets of stronger - than - average bonds ; these griffiths clusters are strongly correlated in imaginary time . in fact",
    ", one obtains a power law decay in the average imaginary time spin autocorrelation function above @xmath4 ; the power law provides a measure of the strength of the griffiths singularities .",
    "the @xmath5 linear susceptibility to a uniform magnetic field oriented along the ising axis is proportional to the time - integral of the average spin - autocorrelation function . for the @xmath68-dimensional quantum ising spin glass case@xcite , the uniform linear susceptibility is divergent for a range of @xmath69 in the paramagnetic phase , due to strong griffiths singularities .",
    "for @xmath70 the linear susceptibility is divergent at @xmath4 but may not be divergent for @xmath7 just above @xmath4@xcite . for the @xmath71-dimensional system ,",
    "on the other hand , we find that this uniform linear susceptibility is finite even at the critical point@xcite .",
    "thus we see that the linear susceptibility gets progressively less divergent with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , it remains of interest to see what is obtained in the case of the average non - linear susceptibility .",
    "it is the non - linear susceptibility that is directly related to spin - glass order and it is always divergent at @xmath4 .",
    "since griffiths singularities originate from local , strongly coupled clusters , we can study them by directly measuring various average local susceptibilities , obtained from the distribution functions of the single - site local magnetizations . in our simulations",

    "the simulations done are performed on massively - parallel maspar computers available at princeton ( with 4096 processors ) and at at&t bell laboratories ( with 16384 processors ) , taking advantage of the fast nearest - neighbor message - passing connections among processors of the machines . in @xmath3 case",
    "the number of independent samples simulated ranges from 1024 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , to 64 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "since we are measuring local quantities on each site ( there are @xmath83 sites per sample ) , the resulting histogram represents quite a substantial amount of data even for the largest sizes where we have the fewest number of samples . up to @xmath84 monte carlo steps",

    "the plots are size dependent for small l , but converge for large sizes to an asymptotic limiting distribution with a power - law tail , as expected .",
    "similar power - law behavior is obtained for the single - site linear susceptibility as well@xcite , with different , but related exponents .",
    "if the probability distribution , @xmath88 , of the nonlinear susceptibility has a power law tail with @xmath89 , then its integral @xmath90 behaves as @xmath91 for large @xmath25 , with a slope @xmath92 in our figures , where we plot @xmath85 vs. @xmath76 on logarithmic scales .",

    "we have found for our model for @xmath117 that the nonlinear susceptibility does diverge in the paramagnetic phase .",
