    "we note that these results for the radial distribution of c@xmath2h within the disk ( i.e. , the best - fit values for @xmath43 , @xmath43 , and @xmath47 ) are not sensitive to the assumed vertical placement of the layer from which the c@xmath2h emission arises .    the distribution of c@xmath2h in the best - fit surface layer model is shown schematically in fig .

    "the modeling described in  3.1 ( and illustrated in fig  [ fig : modelplot ] ) indicates that the inner edge of the c@xmath2h ring imaged by the sma , @xmath61 au , lies roughly midway between the inner edge of n@xmath2h@xmath10 emission as imaged by alma ( @xmath030 au ; * ? ? ?",

    "the n@xmath2h@xmath10 emission inner cutoff likely traces the radius at which co freezes out onto grain surfaces @xcite , whereas the submm continuum outer cutoff marks the radius at which the large ( radius @xmath631 mm ) dust grain population drops precipitously .",

    "the location of the c@xmath2h emission inner cutoff with respect to the co snow line  and the persistence of c@xmath2h emission at disk radii well beyond the drop in large - grain surface density  suggests that the c@xmath2h abundance is enhanced in radial zones where small , ice - coated grains are plentiful .",

    "a large number of pure gas - phase processes could be responsible for production of c@xmath2h ( see , e.g. , fig .  7 in",
    "many of these channels are initiated via destruction of co and the consequent generation of ionized c . near the disk surface  above the layer where co is photodissociated by stellar uv and x - ray photons  c ions and atoms can react with h@xmath2 and ch@xmath65 , respectively , to form c@xmath2h@xmath66 , followed by recombination and dissociation to c@xmath2h .",

    "* ) do yield a ring - like distribution of enhanced c@xmath2h , with inner radius @xmath050 au , deep within the disk .",
    "however , this placement of the emitting c@xmath2h ( near the disk midplane ) appears to be inconsistent with considerations of molecular excitation (  3.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that these pure gas - phase models underpredict the c@xmath2h column densities by at least an order of magnitude ( similar modeling results were obtained by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it therefore appears that pure gas - phase processes fail to explain the presence of the observed bright c@xmath2h ring in the tw hya disk .      in disk environments such as tw hya s , where primitive organics ( e.g. , cn , hcn and c@xmath2h@xmath2 ) are relatively abundant @xcite",
    ", it is likely that more complex organic molecules form and freeze out onto dust grains .",
    "desorption of such ice - coated grains by stellar high - energy radiation  especially x - rays  can then be a rich source of dissociation products of the parent organics @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether an x - ray - dominated mechanism could produce c@xmath2h high in the atmosphere of the outer disk , given that the stellar x - rays should penetrate relatively deeply within the disk @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that increasing gas / dust ratios in these more remote disk regions can facilitate the dredging of small , ice - coated grains to the disk surface , where they are efficiently irradiated by ice - destroying uv .",
    "however , this uv - driven photodesorption process should result in efficient c@xmath2h production at radii @xmath6745 au , i.e. , at least to the co `` snow line '' at @xmath030 au ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . hence  as in the case of pure gas - phase processes that are driven by stellar irradiation (  4.2.1 )  `` shadowing '' of the disk outer regions ( by inner disk material ) might be required to explain the fact that the c@xmath2h generated by ice photodesorption is evidently restricted to somewhat larger disk radii ( @xmath6345 au ) .",
    "dust grain fragmentation / coagulation equilibrium models predict both a faster rate of grain growth in the inner disk , where gas densities are high , and more efficient collisional shattering of grains at large disk radii , where the gas surface densities are lower .",
    "the combination of the relatively sharp cutoff of submm emission in the tw hya disk at @xmath060 au @xcite and the much larger extent of the disk in scattered near - infrared light @xcite is consistent with such modeling .",
    "this contrast likely reflects a transition within the disk from efficient dust grain coagulation and settling to more efficient grain fragmentation and levitation .    the outer disk environment",
    "hence may harbor an enhanced abundance of very small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , particularly in the disk s upper layers ( see , e.g. , fig .  7 in",
    "* ) . once exposed to stellar uv and x - rays",
    ", these small grains and pahs would undergo photodegradation to form loose c@xmath2h@xmath2 groups , which would then photodissociate to produce the observed c@xmath2h .",
    "preliminary calculations , based on a simple scheme whereby uv irradiation breaks pahs into c@xmath2h@xmath2 units , suggest that to explain the c@xmath2h column density inferred here ( i.e. , @xmath68 @xmath13 ) , the relative abundance of pahs per h nucleus in the upper layers of the disk would need to be perhaps an order of magnitude larger than the canonical relative pah abundance in the interstellar medium .",
    "as noted , such an enhanced pah abundance could be a byproduct of the steeply falling gas surface density in the outer disk , which should yield disk conditions favorable for the production of small grains .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of x - rays in the pah photodestruction model would lower the required pah abundance . hence , in light of the modeling results presented in (  3.1 , 3.2 ) , we consider photodestruction of small grains and pahs in disk surface layers to be a plausible source of the observed c@xmath2h .",
    "the c@xmath2h production rates from irradiated small grains would be further enhanced if organic ices coat these grains (  4.2.2 ) .",
    "we propose the following schematic model to explain the c@xmath2h spatial distribution , and its apparently subthermal excitation , within the tw hya disk .",
    "large surface densities are required to form submm - sized grains , which also drift radially as the disk evolves ; such grain growth and migration manifests itself as a sharp edge in the submm dust grain distribution @xcite .",
    "a corresponding increase in small grain surface density in the disk upper layers moving radially outward , evidently beginning at radii as small as @xmath045 au , then provides `` fertile ground '' for uv and soft x - rays generated at tw hya ( via chromospheric activity and accretion shocks ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to efficiently destroy small grains , pahs , and/or grain mantles composed of organic ices .",

    "<S> based on a model in which the c@xmath2h column density follows a truncated radial power - law distribution , we find that the inner edge of the ring lies at @xmath045 au , and that the ring extends to at least @xmath0120 au . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with previous ( single - dish ) observations of c@xmath2h @xmath6 emission indicates that the c@xmath2h molecules are subthermally excited and , hence , that the emission arises from the relatively warm ( @xmath7 k ) , tenuous ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) upper atmosphere of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> based on these results and comparisons of the sma c@xmath2h map with previous submm and scattered - light imaging , we propose that the c@xmath2h emission most likely traces particularly efficient photo - destruction of small grains and/or photodesorption and photodissociation of hydrocarbons derived from grain ice mantles in the surface layers of the outer disk . </S>",
