    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the current energy density of the cmb and @xmath6 is a free parameter , defined as the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the cosmic dark radiation background . in the standard scenario ,",
    "the expected value is @xmath7 , corresponding to the three active neutrino contribution and considering effects related to non - instantaneous neutrino decoupling and qed finite temperature corrections to the plasma .",
    "the most recent cmb data analyses gives @xmath8 ( @xmath9  cl )  @xcite , see also refs .",
    "the simplest scenario to explain the extra dark radiation @xmath10 arising from cosmological data analyses assumes the existence of extra sterile neutrino species .",
    "however , there are other possibilities which are as well closely related to minimal extensions to the standard model of elementary particles , as axions , extra dimensions or asymmetric dark matter models .    dark radiation ,",
    "apart from being parametrized by its effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath6 , is also characterized by its clustering properties , i.e , its rest - frame speed of sound , @xmath11 , and its viscosity parameter , @xmath12 , which controls the relationship between velocity / metric shear and anisotropic stress in the dark radiation background  @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath12 different from zero , as expected in the standard scenario , sustains the existence of dark radiation anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "the standard value of @xmath13 implies that the anisotropies in the dark radiation background are present and they are identical to the neutrino viscosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the case @xmath14 cuts the boltzmann hierarchy of the dark radiation perturbations at the quadrupole , representing a perfect fluid with density and velocity ( pressure ) perturbations exclusively .",
    "a value of @xmath11 different from the canonical @xmath15 leads to a non - adiabatic dark radiation pressure perturbation , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the density perturbation in the rest frame , where the dark radiation velocity perturbation is zero .",
    "interacting dark radiation arises naturally in the so - called asymmetric dark matter models ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , in which the dark matter production mechanism is similar and related to the one in the baryonic sector . in these models , there exists a particle - antiparticle asymmetry at high temperatures in the dark matter sector .",
    "the thermally symmetric dark matter component will annihilate and decay into dark radiation degrees of freedom . since the dark radiation and",
    "the dark matter fluids are interacting , there was an epoch in the early universe in which these two dark fluids were strongly coupled .",
    "this results in a tightly coupled fluid with a pressure producing oscillations in the matter power spectrum analogous to the acoustic oscillations in the baryon - photon fluid before the recombination era . due to the presence of a dark radiation - dark matter interaction ,",
    "the clustering properties of the dark radiation component can be modified  @xcite .",
    "in other words , if dark radiation is made of interacting particles , the values of the clustering parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 may differ from the canonical @xmath18 .",
    "the cosmological implications of interacting dark radiation with canonical clustering properties have been carefully explored in refs .",
    "@xcite , see also the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we generalize the analysis and leave the three dark radiation parameters @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 to vary freely within a @xmath20cdm scenario with a dark radiation - dark matter interaction .",
    "we will see that the bounds from current cosmological data on the dark radiation properties derived in non interacting schemes in refs .",
    "@xcite will be , in general , relaxed , when an interaction between the dark radiation and the dark matter fluids is switched on . while the bounds on the number of extra dark radiation species will not be largely modified in coupled schemes , the errors on the dark radiation effective velocity and viscosity parameters will be drastically increased in interacting scenarios .",
    "we also show here how future cmb measurements , as those from the planck  @xcite and core  @xcite experiments , can lead to large biases on the dark radiation clustering parameters if the dark radiation and dark matter fluids interact in nature but the data is analyzed in the absence of such a coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : drm ] presents the parametrization used for dark radiation , describing the dark radiation - dark matter interactions explored here and their impact on the cosmological observables used in the analysis , as the cmb temperature anisotropies and the matter power spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the data sets used in the monte carlo analyses presented in sec .  [ sec : results ] , which summarizes the constraints on interacting dark radiation properties from current cosmological data .",
    "future cmb dark radiation measurements are presented in sec .",

    "we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the evolution of the dark radiation linear perturbations reads  @xcite    @xmath21    where the dots refer to derivatives with respect to conformal time , @xmath22 is the scale factor , @xmath23 is the wavenumber , @xmath11 is the effective sound speed , @xmath12 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the dark radiation energy density perturbation and velocity divergence , respectively , and @xmath26 are the higher order moments of the dark radiation distribution function . in the set of equations above , @xmath27 is the anisotropic stress perturbation , and @xmath28 is the metric shear , defined as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the scalar metric perturbations in the synchronous gauge",
    ". the anisotropic stress would affect the density perturbations , as in the case of a real fluid , in which the stress represents the viscosity , damping the density perturbations .",
    "the relationship between the metric shear and the anisotropic stress can be parametrized through a `` viscosity parameter '' , @xmath12  @xcite :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the divergence of the fluid velocity .",
    "although the perturbed einstein and energy - momentum conservation equations are enough to describe the evolution of the cosmological perturbations of non - relativistic particles , it is convenient to introduce the full distribution function in phase space to follow the perturbation evolution of relativistic particles , that is , to consider their boltzmann equation . in order to determine the evolution equation of dark radiation , the boltzmann equation is transformed into an infinite hierarchy of moment equations , that must be truncated at some maximum multipole order @xmath34 .",
    "then , the higher order moments of the distribution function are truncated with appropriate boundary conditions , following ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the presence of a dark radiation - dark matter interaction , the euler equations for these two dark fluids",
    "read    @xmath35    where the momentum transfer to the dark radiation component is given by @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , the former quantity is the differential opacity , which gives the scattering rate of dark radiation by dark matter  @xcite . the complete euler equation for dark radiation , including the interaction term with the dark matter fluid , reads    @xmath37    following refs .",
    "@xcite we parameterize the coupling between massless neutrinos and dark matter through a cross section given by @xmath38    if it is constant , or @xmath39    if it is proportional to @xmath40 , where the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants in @xmath43 mev@xmath44 units .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the cosmological implications of both constant and t - dependent interacting cross sections are very similar .",
    "therefore , in the following , we focus on the constant cross section case , parameterized via @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ ws ] , upper panel , shows the cmb temperature anisotropies for @xmath45 @xmath43mev@xmath44 and one dark radiation interacting species , i.e. @xmath46 , as well as for the non interacting case for the best fit parameter values from wmap seven year data analysis  @xcite together with wmap and south pole telescope ( spt ) data  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the behavior of the temperature anisotropies for different assumptions of the dark radiation clustering parameters .",
    "notice that the presence of a dark radiation - dark matter interaction enhances the height of the cmb peaks due to both the presence of an extra radiation component ( @xmath47 ) and the fact that dark matter is no longer pressureless ( due to a non zero @xmath41 )",
    ". therefore @xmath47 and @xmath41 will be negatively correlated .",
    "the location of the peaks also changes , mostly due to the presence of extra radiation @xmath47 .",
    "the peaks will be shifted to higher multipoles @xmath48 due to changes in the acoustic scale , given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the comoving angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface and the sound horizon at the recombination epoch @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath50 almost remains the same for different values of @xmath47 , @xmath51 becomes smaller when @xmath47 is increased .",
    "therefore , the positions of the acoustic peaks are shifted to higher multipoles ( smaller angular scales ) if the value of @xmath19 is increased .",
    "notice , however , that this effect can be compensated by changing the cold dark matter density , in such a way that @xmath52 remains fixed , see ref .",
    "changing @xmath12 modifies the ability of the dark radiation to free - stream out of the potential wells  @xcite .",
    "notice from fig .",
    "[ ws ] ( upper panel ) , that lowering @xmath12 to the value @xmath14 , the tt power spectrum is enhanced with respect to the standard case without the dark radiation and the dark matter species interacting .",
    "this situation can be explained , roughly , as the dark radiation component becoming a perfect fluid .",
    "that is , we are dealing with a single fluid characterized by an effective viscosity . disregarding the fluid nature and the physical origin of the viscosity ,",
    "the general consideration holds : for a given perturbation induced in the fluid , the amplitude of the oscillations that the viscosity produces ( see , e.g. @xcite ) increases as the viscosity is reduced .",
    "therefore , lowering @xmath12 diminishes the amount of damping induced by the dark radiation viscosity , and , consequently , in this case , the amplitude of the cmb oscillations will increase , increasing in turn the amplitude of the angular power spectrum .",
    "therefore , we expect the interaction strength size @xmath41 and the @xmath12 parameter to be positively correlated .",
    "on the other hand , a change of @xmath11 implies a decrease of pressure perturbations for the dark radiation component in its rest frame . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ws ] ( upper panel ) , a decrease in @xmath11 from its canonical @xmath0 to the value @xmath53 leads to a damping of the cmb peaks , since dark radiation is behaving as a pressureless fluid from the perturbation perspective . in the case of @xmath11",
    ", we expect this parameter to be negatively correlated with @xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ ws ] ( lower panel ) depicts the matter power spectrum in the presence of a dark radiation - dark matter interaction for different values of the dark radiation clustering parameters ( including the standard case with @xmath54 ) for one dark radiation interacting species , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "we illustrate as well the case of a pure @xmath20cdm universe .",
    "notice that , since the dark matter fluid is interacting with the dark radiation component , the dark matter component is no longer presureless , showing damped oscillations",
    ". the smaller wave mode at which the interaction between the dark fluids will leave a signature on the matter power spectrum is roughly @xmath56 , which corresponds to the size of the universe at the time that the dark radiation - dark matter interaction becomes ineffective  @xcite , i.e. when @xmath57 ( being @xmath58 the hubble parameter and @xmath59 the effective dark radiation - dark matter scattering rate @xmath60 ) . for the case of constant dark radiation - dark matter interacting cross section , the typical scale @xmath61 reads , for @xmath46 :    @xmath62    notice however from fig .",
    "[ ws ] ( lower panel ) that , while varying @xmath12 the matter power spectrum barely changes , a change in @xmath11 changes dramatically the matter power spectrum , washing out any interacting signature .",
    "for instance , if @xmath63 , dark radiation is a presureless fluid which behaves as dark matter , inducing an enhancement of the matter fluctuations , and , consequently , the presence of a dark radiation - dark matter interaction will not modify the matter power spectrum , see the lower panel of fig .  [ ws ] . therefore , one might expect a degeneracy between the dark radiation - dark matter coupling and the dark radiation @xmath11 parameter : the larger the interaction is , the smaller @xmath11 should be to compensate the suppression of power at scales @xmath64 .

    "standard dark radiation is made of three light active neutrinos . however , many extensions of the standard model of elementary particles predict an extra dark radiation component in the form of sterile neutrinos , axions or other very light degrees of freedom which may interact with the dark matter sector .",
    "in fact , once that one assumes the existence of extra dark radiation species as well as the existence of a dark matter sector there is a priori no fundamental symmetry which forbids couplings between these two dark fluids .",
    "if one allows for such a possibility , the clustering properties of these extra dark radiation particles might not be identical to those of the standard model neutrinos , since the extra dark radiation particles are coupled to the dark matter . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the constraints from recent cosmological data on the dark radiation abundances , effective velocities and viscosity parameters .",
    "while the bounds on @xmath47 are very close to those of uncoupled models , the errors on the clustering dark radiation properties are largely increased , mostly due to the existing degeneracies among the dark radiation - dark matter coupling and @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the cosmological bounds on the dark radiation effective velocity @xmath11 found in non - interacting schemes are degraded by an order of magnitude when a dark radiation - dark matter interaction is switched on . in the case of the viscosity parameter @xmath12 ,",
    "the errors on this parameter are a factor of two larger when considering interacting scenarios .",
    "we have also explored the perspectives from future cosmic microwave background data . if dark radiation and dark matter interact in nature , but the data are analysed assuming the standard , non interacting picture , the reconstructed values for the effective velocity and for the viscosity parameter will be shifted from their standard @xmath0 expectation , namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath3  cl for the future core cmb mission .",
