    "executing computation and communication tasks @xcite in quantum information processing ( qip ) are very attractive in recent years , since these tasks can be accurately completed with suitable boundary condition of time - dependent interactions .",
    "for example , based on the idea of guiding the evolution of the system `` riding '' the adiabatic eigenstates from its initial state to the target state , adiabatic methods have been proposed , and widely used successfully in many research fields , such as laser cooling and atom optics @xcite , metrology @xcite , interferometry @xcite , chemical reaction dynamics @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , etc .. the most famous examples of adiabatic methods are the stimulated raman adiabatic passages ( stirap ) and its variants @xcite , which have shown many advantages .",
    "for instance , the protocols with the stirap have great robustness against pulse area and timing errors .",
    "moreover , when the system stays in the instantaneous ground state of its time - dependent hamiltonian during the whole evolution process under an adiabatic control , the populations of the lossy intermediate states can be restrained so that the dissipation caused by decoherence , noise and losses can be repressed .",
    "although the adiabatic passages hold several advantages , the methods with stirap require the system being restricted by the adiabatic condition , which may greatly reduce the evolution speed of the system and make the system suffering more from the dissipation of its initial state and target state .",
    "for example , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , by using stirap to create entanglement , the fidelities of obtaining the target states are very sensitive to the dephasing due to a long time evolution .",
    "it is generally known that in the field of quantum computing and quantum - information processing , the speed and precision are two primary factors .",
    "therefore , in order to drive a system from a given initial state to a prescribed final state in a shorter time without losing the robustness property , a new sort of technique called `` shortcuts to adiabatic passages '' ( stap ) @xcite has been put forward .",
    "the stap aims at leading an adiabatic - like way between the system s initial state and the target state while the adiabatic condition is completely broken so that the evolution of the system can be accelerated a lot .",
    "moreover , when suitable boundary condition of time - dependent interactions are set , the robustness of stap against parameter variations and decoherence mechanisms is also quite nice . because of the attractive advantages",
    ", the stap has been applied in many kinds of research fields , e.g. , `` fast cold - atom '' , `` fast ion transport '' , `` fast quantum information processing '' , `` fast wave - packet splitting '' , `` fast expansion '' , and so on @xcite . among these works @xcite ,",
    "shortcut protocols @xcite with the method named `` transitionless quantum driving '' ( tqd ) are interesting . in these protocols",
    "@xcite , modifications of original hamiltonians could be constructed to compensate for nonadiabatic errors by adding `` counter - diabatic driving '' ( cdd ) terms with tqd . however , as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cdd terms sometimes paly roles as either direct couplings between the initial state and the target state @xcite or couplings not available in the original hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in some previous protocols @xcite that , a direct coupling between the initial state and the target state may be hard to be realized in several cases , such as the special one - photon 1 - 3 pulse ( the microwave field ) for an atom transition .",
    "therefore , many other interesting approaches @xcite have been presented to construct stap and avoid the issues caused by tqd .",
    "for example , torrontegui _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have used the dynamical symmetry of the hamiltonian to find alternative hamiltonians that achieved the same goals as speed - up protocols via lie transforms without directly using the counterdiabatic hamiltonian .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested to use iterative interaction pictures ( also called the `` multiple schrdinger pictures '' ) to obtain hamiltonians with physically feasible structure for quantum systems .",
    "they have also studied the capabilities and limitations of superadiabatic iterations to construct a sequence of shortcuts to adiabaticity by iterative interaction pictures @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the method with multiple schrdinger pictures has been expanded by song _",
    "@xcite to a three - level system .",
    "they have shown an interesting result that the hamiltonian in the second iteration of the interaction pictures has the same form as the hamiltonian in the original schrdinger picture @xcite .",
    "recently , baksic _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed an interesting protocol about significantly speeding up adiabatic state transfers by using dressed states .",
    "moreover , they have indicated in their article @xcite that the populations of the intermediate states can be controlled by choosing one of the controlled parameters and such control is unable in the protocols with superadiabatic iterations .",
    "this result is quite attractive , since one can decrease the populations of the intermediate states by adjusting the corresponding parameters in order to reduce the dissipation of the intermediate states and improve the fidelity of obtaining the target state . considering the advantages of the method by using dressed states , it is worthwhile to dig out the applications of this method for qip in various physics systems .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been reported in the recent developments in circuit quantum electrodynamics , superconducting devices ( including single cooper pair boxes , josephson junctions , and superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) ) have a natural superiority for their scalability to be regarded as very prospective candidates to implement qip @xcite .",
    "superconducting qubits are relatively easy to scale up and have a long decoherence time @xcite . moreover , using squid qubits in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) have several advantages .",
    "for example , the positions of squid qubits in a cavity are fixed while for cavity - atom systems it remains a significant technical challenge to control the center of mass motion of a neutral atom @xcite . besides , by changing local bias fields or designing suitable variations , level structure of every individual squid qubit can be adjusted readily @xcite . furthermore , when squid qubits are embedded in a cavity , the strong - coupling limit of the cavity qed can be easily realized while for atoms in a cavity , that is difficult to be achieved @xcite .",
    "therefore , squid qubits are attractive tools for implement quantum information tasks .    combining the advantages of the method with dressed states @xcite and squid qubits",
    ", we investigate the entanglement preparation in the present protocol .",
    "considering the importance of w states in both examining quantum nonlocality @xcite and implementing quantum information tasks @xcite , we prepare w states for three squid qubits by using dressed states as an example . in this protocol , laser pulses can be designed so that a w state of three squid qubits can be obtained with high speed without using any additional couplings . besides , the rabi frequencies of pulses designed by the method with dressed states could be realized without challenges in experiments since they can be expressed by the linear superpositions of gaussian functions . by selecting suitable controlled parameters ,",
    "the populations of the intermediate states can be restrained , hence the system will suffer less from dissipation of intermediate states .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that the protocol is robust against the parameter variations and decoherence mechanisms .",
    "different from the protocol for generating w states with the adiabatic passages in ref .",
    "@xcite , in this paper , through choosing a set of dressed states suitably , the protocol can be used to accelerate the adiabatic passages while additional couplings are unnecessary .",
    "so , the w state can be generated faster than that in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , limited by the adiabatic condition , the w state generation in ref .",
    "@xcite is more sensitive to the dephasing . on the contrary , since the w state can be fast generated here , the present protocol is much more robust against the dephasing .",
    "therefore , the present protocol is more feasible for experimental realization .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will review the method to accelerate the adiabatic passages by using dressed states proposed in ref . @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we will describe how to prepare w state of three squid qubits by using dressed states . in sec .",
    "iv , we will investigate the performance of the protocol via numerical simulations . and",
    "finally , the conclusion will be given in sec .",
    "in this section , we would like to review the method to accelerate the adiabatic passages by using dressed states proposed in ref .",
    "firstly , we define a picture transformation @xmath0 , where , @xmath1 are the instantaneous eigenstates of the original hamiltonian @xmath2 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are a set of time - independent states . in adiabatic picture , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath5 in which @xmath6 generically has off - diagonal matrix elements connecting the various instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath2 and causing nonadiabatic errors . in order to correct the nonadiabatic errors , a correction hamiltonian @xmath7",
    "is introduced such that the modified hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , in adiabatic picture , the modified hamiltonian becomes @xmath9    secondly , we define another picture transformation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are a set of dressed states . assuming that the initial time is @xmath12 and the final time is @xmath13 , the unitary operator @xmath14 should satisfy the condition @xmath15 .",
    "then , we move from the adiabatic picture to the new picture called `` dressed - state picture '' .",
    "@xmath16 in adiabatic picture will become @xmath17 afterwards , @xmath7 should be carefully designed so that the modified hamiltonian @xmath18 and the dressed states @xmath11 satisfy @xmath19 @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath7 has to be designed for canceling the unwanted off - diagonal elements in @xmath21 .",
    "let us investigate the entanglement preparation with squid qubits by using dressed states .",
    "as an example , we will expound how to prepare w states of three squid qubits by using dressed states .",
    "the squid qubits considered here are rf squid qubits .",
    "each squid qubit consisting of a josephson tunnel junction in a superconducting loop .",
    "the hamiltonian of each rf squid qubit can be described as @xcite @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the junction capacitance and @xmath24 is the loop inductance , @xmath25 is the total charge on the capacitor , @xmath26 is the magnetic flux threading the loop , @xmath27 is the external flux applied to the ring , @xmath28 is the flux quantum , @xmath29 is the josephson energy with @xmath30 being the critical current of the junction .",
    "we consider that there are four squid qubits , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , coupled to a single - mode microwave cavity field .    as shown in fig . 1 , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) has the @xmath37-type configuration formed , that is , an excited level @xmath38 and two lowest levels @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the classical field with rabi frequency @xmath41 drives the transition resonantly between the levels @xmath38 and @xmath40 , while the cavity field couples resonantly to the levels @xmath39 and @xmath38 with coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are given in refs .",
    "@xcite as @xmath43 where , @xmath44 is surface bounded by the loop of the @xmath35 , @xmath45 is the loop inductance of @xmath35 , @xmath46 is the cavity frequency , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the magnetic components of the cavity mode and the classical microwave in the superconducting loop of the @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the interaction picture with the rotating - wave approximation can be described as ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 in which @xmath51 denotes photon annihilation operator of the cavity mode . for simplicity , we set @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which can be realized by adjusting location or parameters of @xmath35 ( e.g. @xmath45 and @xmath44 )",
    ". moreover , we assume the system is initially in state @xmath54 ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the vacuum state and one - photon state of the cavity mode , respectively ) . defining the excited number operator of the system as @xmath57",
    ", one can obtain that @xmath58=0 $ ] and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the system will stay in the one - excited sub - system spanned by @xmath60 of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is used to provide a photon to the cavity .",
    "then , we rewrite @xmath61 in this one - excited subspace as @xmath62 . assuming @xmath63 , we have @xmath64",
    ". the eigenstates of @xmath61 are calculated in the following @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , respectively . for simplicity ,",

    "a general adiabatic state transfer from the initial state @xmath78 to the target state @xmath79 can be performed via @xmath80 with boundary condition @xmath81 and @xmath82 . to speed up the evolution using dressed states , we firstly go into the adiabatic picture . by using picture transformation @xmath83 , the hamiltonian in adiabatic picture is @xmath84 where @xmath85,\\ \\",

    "@xcite , moving to `` dressed - state picture '' , one can chose a picture transformation @xmath88\\exp[i\\mu(t)m_x]\\exp[i\\xi(t)m_z],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is parametrized as a rotation of spin with euler angles @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . moreover , to full fill the condition @xmath92 , the angle @xmath90 should satisfy @xmath93 , and the other two angles can have arbitrary values .",
    "if we want the correction hamiltonian @xmath7 to has the same form as @xmath74 , @xmath7 can be chosen to have the general form @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are two controlled parameters .",
    "therefore , what we need is only a simple modification of the original angle @xmath97 and amplitude @xmath98 as @xmath99    in addition , to cancel the unwanted transitions between dressed states in the `` dressed - state picture '' , the controlled parameters should be chosen as @xmath100 and they are independent of @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , the population of the intermediate state @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 .",
    "to full fill boundary condition @xmath93 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 as well as avoid the singularity of the expression for each pulse , we adopt the following parameters @xmath103,\\cr\\cr & & \\dot{\\mu}(t)=\\frac{\\pi a}{t}\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi t}{t}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is a time - independent parameter which controls the maximal value of @xmath90 .",
    "if we set @xmath105 , when @xmath104 decreases , the population of intermediate state @xmath101 also decreases , however , according to the expression of @xmath96 , the value of @xmath106 will increase ; that means one has to increase the interaction time @xmath107 when the pulses amplitudes @xmath108 has a fixed value .",
    "therefore , it is better to choose a suitable @xmath104 , so that both population of intermediate state @xmath101 and interaction time can be restricted in a desired range .",
    "we find that @xmath109 can meet our requirement , which gives @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "till now , there is still a question being remained , that is , the expressions of pulses @xmath112 and @xmath113 are too complex for realization in experiments . in order to make the protocol more feasible in experiments , the rabi frequencies of pulses should be expressed by some frequently used functions , e.g. gaussian functions and sine functions , or their linear superpositions . thanks to the curve fitting , we find two replaceable pulses @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively for @xmath116 and @xmath117 as @xmath118 ^ 2}+\\zeta_{a_2}e^{-[(t-\\tau_{a_2})/\\chi_{a_2}]^2},\\cr\\cr & & \\bar{\\omega}_b(t)=\\zeta_{b_1}e^{-[(t-\\tau_{b_1})/\\chi_{b_1}]^2}+\\zeta_{b_2}e^{-[(t-\\tau_{b_2})/\\chi_{b_2}]^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath119 here , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) is the pulse amplitude of the @xmath123-th component in pulse @xmath124 , @xmath125 describes the extreme point of the @xmath123-th component in pulse @xmath124 , and the @xmath126 controls the width of @xmath123-th component in pulse @xmath124 .    as a comparison , we plot @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) with @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) versus @xmath127 in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ( fig .",
    "2 ( b ) ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the solid blue curve for @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) and the dashed red curve for @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) are considerably close to each other . in the next section , pulses with rabi frequencies @xmath128 ,",
    "@xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 will be demonstrated to drive the system from its initial state @xmath132 to the target state @xmath133 with high fidelity via numerical simulations for the sake of proving the replacements here for the rabi frequencies of the pulses are effective .",
    "in this section , we will investigate the performance of the protocol via numerical simulations .",
    "the fidelity of the target state @xmath79 is defined as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the density operator of the system .",
    "firstly , as condition @xmath70 is set to obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath74 , so before doing numerical simulations and further discussions based on the original hamiltonian @xmath136 in the interaction picture , we need to choose a suitable value for coupling constant @xmath137 .    in present protocol ,",
    "the pulses amplitudes are @xmath138 , and condition @xmath70 can be replaced by @xmath139 . seen from fig .",
    "3 , the final fidelity @xmath140 is almost 1 when @xmath141 .",
    "that means even if condition @xmath139 is violated , one can also obtain a w state by using the present protocol . generally speaking , since the coupling constant @xmath137 has an upper limit in real experiments , the condition @xmath139 may cause the speed limit of the system s evolution .",
    "but when @xmath139 is full filled , the system is guided by the effective hamiltonian @xmath74 , so the dark state @xmath101 of @xmath61 has an absolutely predominance among all the intermediate states . since @xmath101 has a lower energy compared with other eigenstates of @xmath61 , using @xmath101 as the intermediate state while restraining populations for other eigenstates of @xmath61 can help us to reduce the dissipation .",
    "however , when @xmath137 is not large enough , the system will evolve along an unknown path , which does not decided by the effective hamiltonian . as a result , the population of each intermediate state can not be forecasted as before , meanwhile @xmath101 does not predominant in this case .",
    "thus dissipation will increase , finally resulting in a relatively bad performance when decoherence mechanisms are taken into account .",
    "therefore , for both high speed and robustness against dissipation , we adopt @xmath142 , slightly larger than @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) . after coupling constant @xmath137 being chosen",
    ", we would like to examine the population @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) of state @xmath147 during the evolution .",
    "so , we plot @xmath148 versus @xmath127 in fig .",
    "4 .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the population @xmath149 ( see the solid pink line of fig .",
    "4 ) , which is not the component of @xmath101 , keeps nearly 0 during the evolution .",
    "this result is coincide with the dynamics governed by @xmath74 .",
    "finally at @xmath150 , the target state @xmath79 can be obtained .    secondly , since accelerating the adiabatic passage is a purpose for implementing the present protocol , it is necessary to show the present protocol is faster than preparing w state with adiabatic passages . here , considering stirap is a famous method for the adiabatic passages , we start with constructing an adiabatic passage to prepare w state by using stirap . we can design the rabi frequencies of pulses as @xmath151 ^ 2},\\ \\omega_4'(t)=\\omega_0'e^{-[(t+t_0-t/2)/t_c]^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath152 is the pulses amplitudes for stirap , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are two related parameters .",
    "then , to compare the present protocol with that by stirap , we plot fig . 5 to show the fidelities of obtaining the target state @xmath79 versus @xmath127 with different methods .    as shown in fig . 5 , the fidelity of the present protocol can reach 1 at @xmath150 ( see the dotted red line in fig .",
    "5 ) while with the same condition for stirap ( @xmath155 , @xmath142 , see the dashed and dotted blue line in fig . 5 ) , the fidelity is only about 0.275 due to the badly violation of the adiabatic condition .",
    "so we increase the pulses amplitudes @xmath152 and the coupling constant @xmath137 to @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively . in this case",
    "( see the dashed black line in fig .",
    "5 ) , the fidelity can increase close to 1 , however , the final fidelity is only 0.985 , still a little disappointing . finally ,",
    "when the pulses amplitudes @xmath152 are increased to @xmath158 , and @xmath137 is increased to @xmath159 , the fidelity even more approach to 1 ( above 0.99 ) , however its performance is still worse than that of the present protocol ( see the solid pink line in fig .",
    "5 ) . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "iii , for a relatively high speed , the product of the pulses amplitudes @xmath160 and the total interaction time @xmath107 is the smaller the better . because when @xmath160 takes a fixed value ( such as the upper limit for the system ) , the one has the smaller product @xmath161 will have less interaction time . in the present protocol ,",
    "the pulses amplitudes @xmath143 is only @xmath162 , while for stirap , to obtain an enough high fidelity , one should set @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , the speed of the present protocol to obtain the target state is faster a lot compared with that with stirap .",
    "thirdly , in real experiments , the dissipation caused by decoherence mechanisms are ineluctable .",
    "therefore , we would like to check the fidelity @xmath140 when decoherence mechanisms are taken into account in order to help us to forecast the experimental feasibility . in the present protocol ,",
    "the major factors of decoherence mechanisms are ( i ) cavity decay ( with decay rate @xmath164 ) , ( ii ) the spontaneous emissions from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and @xmath40 with spontaneous emission rates @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively , ( iii ) the dephasing between @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath38 and @xmath40 ) with dephasing rate @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the evolution of the system can be described by a master equation in lindblad form as following @xmath169+\\sum\\limits_{l}[l_l\\rho l_l^{\\dagger}-\\frac{1}{2}(l_l^{\\dagger}l_l\\rho+\\rho l_l^{\\dagger}l_l)],\\ ] ] where , @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) is the lindblad operator .",

    "in conclusion , we have proposed a protocol to prepare w states with squid qubits by using dressed states .",
    "firstly , we examined and simplified the system s dynamics and obtained the effective hamiltonian so that the simplified model can be regarded as a three - level system .",
    "this greatly help us to further investigate about the speeding up of the system s evolution with dressed states .",
    "secondly , we applied the method with dressed states to the simplified three - level model , in order to keep the system evolving along a suitable dressed state during the evolution .",
    "and we carefully designed the parameters @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , which are shown in eq .",
    "( [ e16.1 ] ) . with these parameters ,",
    "the rabi frequencies of pulses being designed can be expressed by the superpositions of gaussian functions with curve fitting , so that they are feasible for experimental realization .",
    "thirdly , we selected a suitable coupling constant @xmath137 for both robustness and speediness . with the designed pulses and the chosen coupling constant , we continued to explore the robustness against all kinds of influencing factors , including the cavity decay , the spontaneous emissions of squid squbits , the dephasing and some parameter variations caused by the imperfect operations , and we found that the present protocol holds great robustness against these influencing factors . meanwhile , we compared the evolution speed of the present protocol with that of stirap .",
    "the results showed that the evolution speed of the present protocol is much faster than that of stirap . on the other hand , in experiment , the squid qubits have a lot of advantages as we discussed in sec .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a protocol to prepare w states with superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) by using dressed states . through choosing a set of dressed states suitably </S>",
    "<S> , the protocol can be used to accelerate the adiabatic passages while additional couplings are unnecessary . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can optimize the evolution of the system with the restraint to the populations of the intermediate states by choosing suitable controlled parameters . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations show that the protocol is robust against the parameter variations and decoherence mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the protocol is faster and more robust against the dephasing , compared with that by the adiabatic passages . as for the rabi frequencies of pulses designed by the method </S>",
    "<S> , they can be expressed by the linear superpositions of gaussian functions , which does not increase difficulties to the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the protocol could be controlled and manipulated easily in experiments with a circuit quantum electrodynamics system . </S>"
