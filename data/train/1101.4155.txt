    "underlying event ( ue ) was originally defined by the cdf collaboration  @xcite and used to investigate properties of the remaining of the events , after jets were identified and removed from there .",
    "the cdf definition of the underlying event is a simple tool in order to work , however detailed structure or information on off - jet particles can not be obtained . on the other hand",
    "the definition is not capable to analyze more than 2-jet structures .",
    "this motivate us to develop a new definition for the underlying event .",
    "to enhance the information content to be extracted from underlying events , we modified the above cdf s definition introducing multiple surrounding belts ( sb ) around the identified jets  @xcite .",
    "this new definition is immediately leads a more detailed analysis of the underlying event , even in case of multiple jets . on the other hand , as a specific case of our new method",
    ", one can get the originally extracted physical observables corresponding to the analysis based on the cdf - definition .    in this short contribution we present the basic properties of the two ways of defining underlying event .",
    "we recall the original cdf - based and our new definition of the underlying events , which will be compared .",
    "we used two physical quantities for our comparison : ( i ) the average hadron multiplicity within the defined areas and ( ii ) the mean transverse momenta _ versus _ multiplicity in the given regions .",
    "quantities were investigated for both definition in parallel .",
    "our analysis is based on jet production and identification in proton - proton collisions at @xmath1 tev .",
    "we used the lhc10e14 jet - jet sample generated by pythia6.2  @xcite framework with cone - based ua1  @xcite jet finder .",
    "any definition of underlying event should strongly depend on a jet - identification method applied in the analysis .",
    "there are various state - of - the - art development on this direction  @xcite , which are very promising .",
    "on the other hand there are still a problematics of these definitions  the strong process dependence .",
    "e.g. changing from proton - proton to nucleus - nucleus collisions need to re - tune the properties of the algorithms in order to find and separate jets and the baseline / background of each event  @xcite .",
    "the cdf - based underlying event definition corresponds to the jet identification in case of a one- ( or two- ) jet events .",
    "near side jets easily define the _ toward _ and the opposite _ away _ regions of the event geometry .",
    "our original concept was to improve the cdf - based definition on a two - folded way :    * to develope an underlying event definition which is capable to handle multijet events . * to investigate the surrounding areas around identified jets , even without major changes of the jet - findig parameters in a case of nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "these requirements are led us to the definition of surrounding belts on the basis of the event - background such as underlying event , which completely satisfy our requirements above .    in our method",
    ", we are using jet - finding algorithms also .",
    "we define jets , than based on the physical properties of the concentrical surrounding belts and the remaining particle multiplicities , a better background or baseline can be provided . on the other hand the analysis of the surrounding area around the identified jets ,",
    "can even give feedback on the goodness of the jet finding parameters .        on fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf - sb - ue ] the visual comparison of the two definitions can be seen .",
    "_ left side _ of the figure is for the cdf - based definition , the _",
    "right side _ displays the sb - based one .",
    "the two definitions can be summarized in a following ways , using the azimuth , @xmath2 and ( pseudo)rapidity , ( @xmath3 or ) @xmath4 plane :    cdf - based definition : :    of the underlying event is based on the subtraction of two areas of    the whole measured acceptance : one around the identified near jet    ( _ toward region _ ) and another to the opposite ( _ away _ ) direction .",
    "both    regions are @xmath5-slices of the    measured acceptance around the near jet and to the opposite , with the    full @xmath6 range and    @xmath7 in azimuth .",
    "sb - based definition : :    uses all identified jets of the event to subtract them from the    background .",
    "each jet can have an approximate dial - like area , around    which concentric bands ( or rings ) can be defined .",
    "if a jet cone angle ,    @xmath8 is given , a first    @xmath9 and a second @xmath10 surrounding    belt can be defined for any jet with the thicknesses of    @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,    respectively . generally , @xmath13 with respect    to the @xmath14 values .",
    "it is easy to see our    underlying event definition is no longer jet - number dependent .",
    "+    furthermore , increasing @xmath15 values , similar    ( but not the same ) area can be covered as in the original cdf - based    definition . in this way",
    "the two model can be comparable too .",
    "now we investigate the basic properties of the areas and parallel the physical quantities for the selected regions .",
    "here we compare the details of the cdf- and surrounding belt ( sb ) based underlying event definitions . for our test",
    "we used pythia6-simulated  @xcite proton - proton collisions ( perugia-0 tune  @xcite ) , namely lhc10e14 jet - jet at 7 tev center - of - mass energy with @xmath16 events .",
    "this sample contains jets identified by ua1 method  @xcite .",
    "we restricted our analysis to the settings of @xmath17 gev / c and @xmath18 gev / c .",
    "primarily we investigated the multiplicities of various geometrical regions of the generated events based on the full sample . after applying ua1 jet finding algorithm to identify jets , we compared the selected areas using both cdf- and sb - based definitions of the underlying events . on left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : n - vs - ntot ] we plotted the multiplicities , @xmath19 of the cdf - selected areas versus the total event multiplicity . here",
    "@xmath19 refers for followings : the multiplicities of the identified leading / near jet ( _ blue squares _ ) , the jet - excluded toward area ( _ green dots _ ) , the away side area to the opposite direction ( _ purple dots _ ) , and the cdf - defined underlying is event , transverse ( _ pink dots _ ) .",

    "[ fig : n - vs - ntot ] shows multiplicity in almost all regions : @xmath19 increases almost linearly with the total multiplicity , in the @xmath26 region of the event for both cases . in case of the cdf - based definition ,",
    "the away region gives the biggest contribution , and the jet belongs to the smallest one .",
    "the transverse ( underlying event ) area lies between the two extremal contribution .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to see , after excluding the jet from the toward region , the remaining area has almost the same multiplicity as the underlying event .",
    "this shows the goodness of the jet finding algorithms and the `` safety '' of the cdf - based underlying event definition ( e.g. 1/3 of the whole acceptance far from any jet - contaminated areas ) .",
    "the multiplicity relations of the sb - based definition differs from the cdf - based .",
    "the near jet has the same contribution , away side jet and the @xmath27s have small fraction from the @xmath25  due to the small areas . on the other hand , the newly defined underlying event , @xmath24 dominates the event multiplicity since it has almost the whole acceptance .    in general the multiplicity fraction of the defined areas are almost proportional to the geometrical surface , only the jet - content part violates this dependence , as fig .",
    "[ fig : n - vs - ntot ] displays .",
    "thus , the sb - based @xmath24 has larger multiplicity comparing to the cdf - based one , which might gives better statistics for an underlying event analysis .    .",

    "we use the same color and mark encoding for the selected regions of the event as on fig .",
    "[ fig : n - vs - ntot ] above .",
    "we found the mean-@xmath29 distributions of the regions are similar in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the identified leading jet has the highest values @xmath30 gev / c , which are decreasing to @xmath31 gev / c as going to larger @xmath25 , for both definition s cases .",
    "the mean-@xmath29 for both underlying event cases are the same with the constant value @xmath32 gev / c . for the cdf - based definition",
    "this is similar to the jet - excluded toward area also , and for the sb - based definition surrounding belts , @xmath27 have also similar , but a slightly higher @xmath33 gev / c .",
    "differences between the left and the right panels are originating from the handling of the near and away side jet .",
    "cdf - based definition contains the jet to the near ( leading ) direction , and fully or partially to the opposite away region : @xmath34 gev / c and @xmath35 gev / c .",
    "sb - based case since away side jets were also identified , @xmath36 gev / c .",
    "we can state generally , both underlying - event definition give the same result and they are differ only in the separation ( or inclusion ) of leading or away side jet to the given areas .         finally on fig .",

    "in parallel the mean-@xmath29 values for the underlying event are almost the same for the average multiplicity events and slightly higher for the rare ones .",
    "we studied our new underlying event definition in @xmath39 tev proton - proton collisions with 150,000 events .",
    "we investigated and compared the multiplicities and the mean-@xmath29 vs. multiplicities for the cdf - based and our sb - based definition .",
    "we found the multiplicity fraction of the defined regions are almost proportional to the geometrical surface , only the jet - content part differs , due to the separation ( or inclusion ) of the leading or away side jets .",
    "the sb - based underlying event , @xmath24 found to have larger multiplicity comparing to the cdf - based , @xmath37 one , which might gives better statistics for the underlying event analysis .",
    "the mean-@xmath29 vs. @xmath25 analysis led us to compare both definition on the same level .",
    "we got the same dependence of the underlying event for both , cdf- and sb - based cases . on the other hand ,",
    "the above mentioned jet and near / away - area handling leads to differences .    finally , we compared our definitions by the mean-@xmath29 vs. the self - defined underlying event multiplicities , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
