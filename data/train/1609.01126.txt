    "recent cosmological data indicate that the universe has undergone two acceleration phases : an early acceleration phase called inflation , prior to a radiation - dominated era , and a more recent era of accelerated expansion which appears to continue today @xcite .",
    "the gravitationally repulsive stress that is responsible for the current acceleration of the universe is called dark energy and must possess sufficient negative pressure to exert gravitational repulsion .",
    "its specific identity is still unknown and it may result from a modification of general relativity when gravity is very weak or the presence of a specific unknown matter field .    whilst a range of exotic  fluids and modifications of the gravitational action can provide cosmological acceleration , scalar fields are the simplest candidates to explain the acceleration phases of the universe .",
    "moreover , scalar fields also have various applications in the inflationary phase of the universe , for instance in driving chaotic inflation @xcite .",
    "while the same scalar field might explain both of the periods of accelerated expansion , no convincing cosmological model has been found with this as a natural feature . in a scalar field",

    "however , scalar - field cosmology is conformally equivalent to other scalar - tensor theories , like brans - dicke or @xmath0-gravity .",
    "hence , closed - form solutions of the conformally equivalent theories ( see @xcite and references therein ) can be used to construct closed - form solutions or to find new integrable systems for the non - minimally coupled scalar - field model .    recently , with the use of nonlocal conservation laws in @xcite , the general analytical solution has been expressed for an arbitrary scalar field with an arbitrary number of independent perfect fluids possessing constant equation of state parameters in spatially flat or nonflat flrw universes .",
    "these general results are applied in this paper to derive precise forms of the scalar field potential for various simple time - dependent forms for the expansion scale factor , or for particular equation of state parameters for the scalar field .",

    ". it can be seen that ( [ sfa.03 ] ) is just equation ( [ sfa.02 ] ) .    by assuming that the universe is spatial isotropic and homogeneous we select the four - dimensional spacetime to be that of flrw @xmath21",
