    "it is well known that proteins consist of amino acids whose number may vary in the range from hundreds up to tens of thousands .",
    "small fragments of proteins are usually called polypeptide chains or polypeptides .",
    "this work is devoted to a study of the conformational properties of alanine polypeptide chains .    since recently , it became possible to study experimentally small fragments of proteins and polypeptides in the gas phase with the use of the maldi mass spectroscopy @xcite and the esi mass spectroscopy @xcite . from theoretical viewpoint , investigation of small polypeptides",
    "is of significant interest because they can be treated by means of _ ab initio _ methods which allowing accurate comparison of theoretical predictions with experiment .",
    "the results of _ ab initio _ calculations can be then utilized for the development of model approaches applicable for the description of larger and more complex protein structures .",
    "polypeptides are characterized by the primary and the secondary structure @xcite .",
    "different geometrical configurations of a polypeptide are often called as the conformations .",
    "one can expect that chemical and physical properties of various conformations of complex molecules might differ significantly .",
    "the number of various conformations ( isomeric states ) grows rapidly with the growth of a system size .",
    "thus , a search for the most stable conformations becomes an increasingly difficult problem for large molecules . with the help of the nmr spectroscopy and the x - rays diffraction analysis",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that the sheet and the helix structures are the most prominent elements of the protein secondary structure .",
    "the main difference between the sheet and the helix structures is due to the difference of the dihedral angles formed by the atoms of the polypeptide chains in the two cases .",
    "these degrees of freedom are responsible for the transition of the molecule from one conformation to another . by increasing the temperature of the system , the degrees of freedom responsible for twisting of the polypeptide chain can be activated .",
    "the study of this transition and evaluation of its characteristic duration are of significant interest , because this problem is closely related to one of the most intriguing problems of the protein physics - the protein folding . to study this transition",
    "it is necessary to investigate the potential energy surface of amino acid chains with respect to their twisting .",
    "besides the protein folding , the potential energy landscapes of polypeptides carry a lot of detail and useful information about the structure of these molecules .    in the present paper",
    "we have studied the potential energy surfaces for small alanine chains .",
    "these molecules were chosen because they are often present in native proteins as fragments , and also because they allow _ ab initio _ theoretical treatment due to their relatively small size .",
    "previously , only glycine and alanine dipeptides were studied in detail .",
    "sometimes their analogues were used to reduce the computational costs ( for example , ( s)-@xmath2-(formylamino)propanamide ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite alanine and glycine dipeptides were investigated within the hartree - fock theory . in these papers",
    "the potential energy surfaces were calculated versus the twisting angles of the molecules .",
    "different stable states of the dipeptides , corresponding to different molecular conformations , were determined .",
    "each stable state of the molecule was additionally studied on the basis of the perturbation theory , which takes into account many - electron correlations in the system . in refs .",
    "@xcite different conformations and their energies were determined within the framework of the density functional theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite dynamics of the alanine dipeptide analog was discussed and the time of the transitions between the two conformations of the alanine dipeptide was found .",
    "a number of papers were devoted to the study of tripeptides . in refs .",
    "@xcite dynamics of the alanine and glycine tripeptides was studied by means of classical molecular dynamics and with the use of semi - empirical potentials ( such as gromos , charmm and amber ) . in @xcite within the framework of the hartree - fock theory several stable conformations of alanine and glycine tripeptides",
    "were found . in ref .",
    "@xcite the raman and ir spectra for alanine and glycine tripeptides were measured in neutral , acidy and alkali environments .",
    "polypeptides have been studied less .",
    "we are aware of only several related papers .",
    "in particular , stable conformations of neutral and charged alanine hexapeptides were obtained with the use of empirical potentials and discussed in ref .",

    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite with the use of empirical molecular dynamics based on monte - carlo methods , a polypeptide consisting of 21 amino acids was described .    in the present paper",
    "we have performed an _ ab initio _ calculation of the multidimensional potential energy surface for the alanine polypeptide chains consisting of three and six amino acids .",
    "the potential energy surface versus twisting degrees of freedom of the polypeptide chain has been calculated .",
    "the calculations have been performed within _ ab initio _ theoretical framework based on the density functional theory ( dft ) accounting for all the electrons in the system .",
    "previously , this kind of calculations were performed only for dipeptides ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for larger molecules ,",
    "only a few conformations were considered ( see citations above ) .",
    "we have calculated the energy barriers for the transitions between different conformations and determined the energetically most favorable ones .",
    "using a thermodynamic approach , we have estimated times of the characteristic transitions between the most energetically favorable conformations .",
    "the results of our calculation have been compared with other theoretical simulations and with the available experimental data .",
    "we have also analyzed how the secondary structure of polypeptide chains influences the potential energy landscapes .",
    "in particular , the role of the secondary structure in the formation of stable conformations of the chains of six amino acids being in the sheet and in the helix conformations has been elucidated .",

    "the atomic system of units , @xmath3 , is used throughout the paper unless other units are indicated .",
    "in the present paper we study the multidimensional potential energy surfaces for alanine polypeptides within the framework of the density functional theory .",
    "the potential energy surfaces are multidimensional functions of atomic coordinates . in our work",
    "the potential energy surfaces are considered as a function of the dihedral angles formed by the atoms of the polypeptide chain . for this calculation the born - oppenheimer approximation allowing to separate the motion of the electronic and ionic subsystems is used .    the density functional theory ( dft )",
    "is a common tool for the calculating of properties of quantum many body systems in which many electron correlations play an important role . the dft formalism is well known and can be found in many textbooks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore in our work we present only the basic equations and ideas of this method .",
    "electronic wave functions and energy levels within the framework of dft are obtained from the kohn - sham equations , which read as ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath4    where the first term represents the kinetic energy of the @xmath5-th electron with the wavefunction @xmath6 and the energy @xmath7 , @xmath8 describes the electron attraction to the ionic centers , @xmath9 is the hartree part of the interelectronic interaction ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath10 is the local exchange - correlation potential .",

    "however , no unique potential @xmath12 , universally applicable for different systems and conditions , has been found so far .",
    "approximate functionals employed by the dft usually partition the exchange - correlation energy into two parts , referred to as the _ exchange _ and the _ correlation _ terms :    @xmath13= e_x(\\rho)+e_c(\\rho ) \\label{ex_core}\\ ] ]    both terms are the functionals of the electron density , which can be of two distinctly different types : either a _ local _ functionals depending only on the electron density @xmath14 , or a _ gradient - corrected _ functionals depending on both @xmath14 and its gradient , @xmath15 .",
    "a variety of exchange correlation functionals can be found in literature . in our work",
    "we have used the hybrid becke - type three - parameter exchange functional ref . @xcite",
    "paired with the gradient - corrected lee , yang and parr correlation functional ( @xmath16 ) refs .",
    "in this section we present the potential energy surfaces for the glycine polypeptide chains calculated versus dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 defined in figure [ angles_def ] . in particular , we focus on the chains consisting of three and six amino acids .",
    "and @xmath1 used to characterize the potential energy surface of the polypeptide chain . ]",
    "both angles are defined by the four neighboring atoms in the polypeptide chain .",
    "the angle @xmath17 is defined as the dihedral angle between the planes formed by the atoms ( @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath6 is defined as the dihedral angle between the ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) planes . beside the angles @xmath17 and @xmath6 there is an angle @xmath22 , which is defined as the dihedral angle between ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath23 ) planes .",
    "the atoms are numbered from the @xmath24 terminal of the polypeptide .",
    "the angles @xmath17 , @xmath6 and @xmath22 take all possible values within the interval [ @xmath25;@xmath26 . for the unambiguous definition",
    "we count the angles @xmath17 , @xmath6 and @xmath22 clockwise , if one looks on the molecule from its @xmath24 terminal ( see fig . [ angles_def ] ) .",
    "this way of angle counting is the most commonly used @xcite .",
    "the angles @xmath17 and @xmath6 can be defined for any amino acid in the chain , except the first and the last ones .",
    "below we omit the subscripts and consider angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the middle amino acid of the polypeptide .      in order to study twisting of a polypeptide chain",
    "one needs first to define its initial structure .",
    "although , the number of its conformations increases with the growth of the molecule size , there are certain types of polypeptide structure , namely the sheet and the helix conformations , which are the most typical . in the present paper",
    "we have investigated twisting of the polypeptide chains of the sheet and the helix conformations . by varying the angles @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 in the central amino acid one can create the structure of the polypeptide differing significantly from the pure sheet or helix conformations .",
    "if the structure of a polypeptide can be transformed to a helix or a sheet one by a trivial variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , such polypeptides for the sake of simplicity are referred below as belonging to the group of the helix or the sheet structure , respectively .        in figure [ stable_geom ]",
    "we present the optimized geometries of alanine polypeptide chains that have been used for the exploration of the potential energy surfaces .",
    "all geometries were optimized with the use of the b3lyp functional . figure [ stable_geom]a shows the alanine tripeptide structure . in the present work we choose the sheet conformation , because the tripeptide is too short to form the helix conformation . figures [ stable_geom]b and [ stable_geom]c show alanine hexapeptide in the sheet and the helix conformations , respectively .",
    "the total energies ( in atomic units)of the molecules are given below the images .",
    "calculated by the b3lyp/6 - 31g(d ) method at different values of angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 . ]    for each amino acid there are only three dihedral angles formed by atoms of the polypeptide chain which describe its twisting . the angle @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ angles_def ] ) differs from the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 , because @xmath28 atom has the @xmath29 hybridization state , what leads to formation of a quasi - double bond between @xmath28 and @xmath30 atoms .",
    "therefore , the angle @xmath27 is often referred as a `` stiff '' degree of freedom , whose value depends only slightly on both the polypeptide constituent amino acids and the values of other degrees of freedom . to illustrate this fact , in figure [ omega_scan ] we present the energy dependencies on @xmath27 calculated for alanine dipeptide with different values of angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the cenral amino acid .    from this figure",
    "it is clear that there are two stable states in the system with @xmath31 and @xmath32 which do not depend on the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the heights of the barriers between these states are weakly depend on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , being equal to @xmath331 ev=23.06 kcal / mol .",
    "the calculation shows that at temperatures close to the room temperature , the value of the angle @xmath27 changes insignificantly . the potential energy surface as a function of the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 appears to be much more complex as it is shown in the next section .          ) . below each image we present angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which have been obtained with accounting for relaxation of all degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "values in brackets give the angles calculated without accounting for relaxation . above each image the energy of the corresponding conformation is given in ev .",
    "the energies are counted from the energy of conformation 1 ( the energy of conformation 1 is given in a.u . ) .",
    "values in parentheses correspond to the energies obtained without relaxation of all degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "dashed lines show the strongest hydrogen bonds .",
    "their lengths are given in angstroms .",
    "]    in figure [ map_ala3 ] we present the potential energy surface for the alanine tripeptide calculated by the b3lyp/6 - 31g(2d , p ) method .",
    "the energy scale is given in ev , kcal / mol and kelvin .",
    "energies on the plot are measured from the lowest energy minimum of the potential energy surface .    from the figure",
    "follows that there are several minima on the potential energy surface .",
    "they are numbered according to the value of the corresponding energy value .",
    "each minimum corresponds to a certain conformation of the molecule .",
    "these conformations differ significantly from each other . in the case of alanine tripeptide",
    "there are six conformations , shown in figure [ geom_ala3 ] .",
    "dashed lines show the strongest hydrogen bonds in the system , which arise when the distance between hydrogen and oxygen atoms becomes less then 2.9 angstroms .    to calculate the potential energy surface the following procedure was adopted .",
    "once the stable structure of the molecule has been determined and optimized , all but two ( these are the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the central amino acid ) degrees of freedom were frozen .",
    "then the energy of the molecule was calculated by varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this procedure was used to calculate all potential energy surfaces presented below in this section .",
    "it allows one to find efficiently the minima on the energy surface and to determine the main stable conformations of the molecule .",
    "the absolute energy values of different conformations of the tripeptide found by this method are not too accurate , because the method does not account for the relaxation of other degrees of freedom in the system . to calculate the potential energy surface with accounting for the relaxation one needs 20 - 30 times more of the computer time .",
    "therefore , a calculations with accounting for the relaxation have not been performed in our work .",
    "instead , we have performed a complete optimization of the molecular conformations , corresponding to all minima on the calculated potential energy surface .    in figure [ geom_ala3 ]",
    "we compare stable conformations of the alanine tripeptide calculated with and without accounting for the relaxation of all atoms in the system .",
    "as it is seen from this figure the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 differ by about 10 percent in the two cases .",
    "this difference arises due to the coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with other degrees of freedom .",
    "note the change of the sign of the relative energies of some conformations .",
    "this effect is due to the rearrangement of side atoms ( radicals ) in the polypeptide chain which lowers the energies of different conformations differently .    in our work",
    "the potential energy surface has been calculated and interpolated on the grid with the step of @xmath34 .",
    "this step size is an optimal one , because the interpolation error is about @xmath35 , i.e. comparable with the angle deviations caused by the relaxation of all degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "note that for the alanine tripeptide an additional maximum appears at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , while it is absent on the potential energy surface for the glycine tripeptide @xcite .",
    "this maximum is a result of overlapping of the side ch@xmath38- radicals , which are substituted in the case of the glycine polypeptide with the @xmath39- atoms .    [",

    "[ ala_experiment]a we show the distribution of the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 of alanine residues in protein structures selected from the brookhaven protein data bank @xcite .",

    "note , that these ellipses are used for illustrative purposes only , and serve for a better understanding of the experimental data .",
    "the regions in which most of the observed angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are located correspond to different secondary structures of the poly - alanine .",

    "region iii corresponds to the right - handed @xmath42helix , right - handed @xmath43helix , right - handed @xmath44 helix and @xmath40turn of type i. region iv corresponds to the left - handed @xmath45helix , right - handed @xmath46helix , left - handed @xmath47 helix and @xmath40turn of type ii . in some cases there",
    "are several types of secondary structure within one domain . in the present work",
    "we have not studied the secondary structure of proteins systematically enough to establish the univocal correspondence of the observed experimental points to different types of the secondary structure .",
    "let us now compare the distribution of angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 experimentally observed for proteins with the potential energy landscape calculated for alanine polypeptides and establish correspondence of the secondary structure of the calculated conformations with the predictions of the simple ramachandran model .",
    "region i corresponds to the minimum 1 on the both potential energy surfaces of the alanine tripeptide ( fig .",
    "[ ala_experiment]b ) and the alanine hexpeptide with the secondary structure of sheet ( fig .",

    "the structure of conformations 2 on the surfaces [ ala_experiment]b and [ ala_experiment]c differs from the structure of this particular helix type .",
    "only the central alanines , for which the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figures [ ala_experiment]b and [ ala_experiment]c are defined , have the structure of @xmath41 helix .",
    "thus , one can refer to the conformations 2 as to the mixed states , where the central part of the polypeptide chain has the conformation of helix and the outermost parts have the conformation of sheet .",
    "conformation 3 on the surface [ ala_experiment]d is also a mixed state . here",

    "conformation 5 on the potential energy surface of the alanine hexapeptide can be characterized as a partially formed @xmath40turn because the alanine , for which the dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure [ ala_experiment]c are defined has the geometry of @xmath40turn , but its neighbor forms a @xmath40sheet ( see fig .",
    "[ ala6]a ) .",
    "conformation 4 on the potential energy surface [ ala6]b changes significantly after accounting for the relaxation of all degrees of freedom in the system , and gets outside the region iii . in this conformation",
    "one can locate fragments of right - handed @xmath41 and @xmath44 helixes .",

    "conformation 3 on the surface [ ala_experiment]c corresponds to partially formed @xmath40turn , because the alanine , for which the dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure [ ala_experiment]c are plotted has the configuration of @xmath40turn but the neighboring amino acid in the polypeptide chain forms @xmath40sheet ( see fig .
