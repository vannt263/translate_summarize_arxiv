    "the magnetic excitations in quantum spin systems , which have a singlet ground state with an excitation gap , are a new subject in magnetism .",
    "recently , neutron inelastic scattering experiments have been actively performed to investigate the magnetic excitations in various coupled spin - dimer systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , ( vo)@xmath8p@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite , cu(no@xmath0)@xmath10d@xmath8o @xcite , bacusi@xmath8o@xmath11 @xcite , srcu@xmath8(bo@xmath0)@xmath8 @xcite and kcucl@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a variety of dispersion relations for the propagation of the excited triplet have been observed in these systems , and the true nature of the exchange networks , which was not expected from the crystal structures , has been revealed in ( vo)@xmath8p@xmath8o@xmath9 and kcucl@xmath0 .",
    "since large single crystals of kcucl@xmath0 can be obtained , its magnetic excitations have been extensively investigated by neutron inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relations were first analyzed using the effective dimer approximation , in which the exchange interactions between individual dimers are reduced to an effective interaction between dimers @xcite .",
    "later , the cluster series expansion was applied by mller and mikeska @xcite to describe the dispersion relation in order to evaluate the individual exchange interactions . from these analyses ,",
    "the exchange network in kcucl@xmath0 was elucidated .",
    "consequently , kcucl@xmath0 has been characterized as a weakly and three - dimensionally coupled spin - dimer system .    in this study , we investigate the magnetic excitations in tlcucl@xmath0 , which is isostructural with kcucl@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this compound has a monoclinic structure ( space group @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure is composed of planar dimers of cu@xmath8cl@xmath11 , which are stacked on top of one another to form infinite double chains parallel to the crystallographic @xmath13-axis .",
    "these double chains are located at the corners and center of the unit cell in the @xmath14 plane , and are separated by tl@xmath15 ions .",
    "figure 1 shows the projection of cu@xmath16 ions with spin-@xmath17 on the @xmath18 plane and the exchange interactions between cu@xmath16 ions . for the notation of the exchange interaction ,",
    "see reference @xcite .",
    "the magnetic ground state of tlcucl@xmath0 is a spin singlet with an excitation gap , as observed in kcucl@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the spin gap @xmath19 in tlcucl@xmath0 was evaluated from the critical field of the magnetization curve @xcite and the excitation energy of the direct esr transition @xcite as @xmath1 mev .",
    "the lattice parameters , the critical fields and the saturation fields for kcucl@xmath0 and tlcucl@xmath0 are listed in table i. the crystal lattice of tlcucl@xmath0 is compressed along the @xmath13-axis and enlarged in the @xmath14 plane as compared with kcucl@xmath0 .",
    "thus , substituting tl@xmath20 for k@xmath20 produces uniaxial stress along the @xmath13-axis .",
    "although the crystal structures of tlcucl@xmath0 and kcucl@xmath0 are the same , there is a significant difference between their magnetic properties , @xmath21 , the spin gap for tlcucl@xmath0 is one - quarter of that for kcucl@xmath0 , while the saturation field for tlcucl@xmath0 is about twice as large as that for kcucl@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the interdimer interactions in tlcucl@xmath0 are much stronger than those in kcucl@xmath0 .",
    "however , the details of the individual exchange interactions in tlcucl@xmath0 have not been clarified so far .    recently the field - induced magnetic phase transition was observed by magnetization and specific heat measurements @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the nature of the phase transition can be described in terms of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the triplet excitations ( magnons ) @xcite . in the magnon bec theory ,",
    "the magnons around the lowest excitation are relevant to the phase transition . for these reasons",
    ", we have investigated the magnetic excitations in tlcucl@xmath22 .",
    "recently cavadini _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also independently investigated the magnetic excitations in tlcucl@xmath0 by means of neutron inelastic scattering .",
    "they measured mainly the dispersions parallel to the principal axes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and evaluated the intradimer exchange interaction and the effective interactions between dimers , which are given by the linear combinations of the individual exchange interactions as shown in section iii . although the present measurements are confined in the @xmath26-plane , we measured the dispersion relations not only parallel to the @xmath23 and @xmath25-axes , but also for two diagonal directions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are roughly perpendicular to each other .",
    "as shown in the next section , the magnetic excitation is most dispersive along @xmath27 , while it is less dispersive along @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath27 direction is parallel to the cleavage @xmath29 plane , in which the hole orbitals of cu@xmath16 spread .",
    "the dispersion relations along @xmath27 and @xmath28 are essential , because the interdimer exchange interactions can not be uniquely determined without them , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is another set of exchange parameters which can fit the dispersion relations principal axes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we analyzed the dispersion relations using a cluster series expansion to sixth order to evaluate the individual interdimer exchange interactions , which can not be determined within the framework of the effective dimer approximation @xcite .",
    "the effective interactions calculated with these individual interdimer exchange interactions are significantly different from those obtained by effective dimer approximation .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is as follows . in the next section , experimental details",
    "are described , and the experimental results are presented . in section iii ,",
    "the experimental results are supplemented by a theoretical analysis based on dispersion curves calculated from a cluster series expansion , and the individual exchange interactions are determined .",
    "section iv is devoted to conclusions .",
    "tlcucl@xmath0 single crystals were grown from a melt by the bridgman method .",
    "the details of sample preparation have been reported in reference @xcite .",
    "the tlcucl@xmath0 crystal cleaves easily parallel to the ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) plane , in which lie the @xmath23- and @xmath25-axes .",
    "neutron inelastic scattering was performed using the issp - ponta spectrometer installed at jrr-3 m , tokai .",
    "the constant-@xmath30 mode was taken with a fixed final neutron energy @xmath31 of 14.8 mev . in order to gain intensity",
    ", collimations were set as open - monochromator - @xmath32 - sample - @xmath32 - analyzer - @xmath32 - detector .",
    "the energy resolution was about 2 mev because of loose collimations .",
    "a pyrolytic graphite filter was placed after the sample to suppress the higher order contaminations .",
    "we used a sample with a volume of approximately 2.5 @xmath33 .",
    "the sample was mounted in an ill - type orange cryostat with its @xmath23- and @xmath25-axes in the scattering plane .",
    "the crystallographic parameters were determined as @xmath34 1/@xmath35 , @xmath36 1/@xmath35 and @xmath37=0.0967 at helium temperatures .    in the previous neutron inelastic scattering measurements for tlcucl@xmath0 @xcite , three excitations were observed in the energy range @xmath38 mev for the scans along @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . from the temperature dependence of the excitation spectra",
    ", we concluded that the lowest dispersive excitation is of magnetic origin .",
    "since the phonon excitation has been observed at almost the same energy in the isostructural kcucl@xmath0 @xcite , we inferred that the highest dispersionless excitation can be attributed to the phonon excitation .",
    "however , the origin of the second excitation was unclear .",
    "we first investigated the temperature variation of these excitations for @xmath46 . at @xmath47 k , three excitations were observed at @xmath48 , 7 and 12 mev . at room temperature , which is much higher than the temperatures corresponding to the excitation energies , the peak intensity of the lowest excitation decreases to the background level , while the intensities of the two higher excitations appear to be almost independent of temperature .",
    "this indicates that the two higher excitations are not intrinsic magnetic excitations .",
    "if the cause of the excitations is phonons , their intensities should increase with increasing temperature .",
    "hence , it is too early to conclude that the two higher excitations are attributable only to phonons .    in the present study , we focused on the lowest magnetic excitation , and investigated the precise dispersion relations along @xmath40 , @xmath49 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 by constant-@xmath2 energy scanning for @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the present scan area is closer to the origin of the reciprocal space than the previous one , so that the magnetic excitations can gain intensity due to the magnetic form factor .",
    "the dispersion relations along diagonal directions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are necessary to determine the exchange network uniquely within the data for the @xmath3 scattering plane .",
    "figure 3 shows the scan profiles for @xmath52 , @xmath49 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 measured at @xmath47 k. a well - defined single excitation can be observed in almost all scans .",
    "the scan profiles were fitted with a gaussian function to evaluate the excitation energy , as shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "3 . the horizontal bars in fig .",
    "3 denote the calculated resolution widths .",
    "almost all peaks have widths equal to the resolution limit .",
    "figure 4 shows the constant-@xmath2 scans for @xmath53 measured at @xmath47 k and 80 k. a single excitation is clearly observed at @xmath54 mev and @xmath47 k. at @xmath55 k , the excitation spectrum broadens out to the background level .",
    "this indicates that the excitation can be attributed to a magnetic origin .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath56 obtained for the @xmath3 scattering plane is summarized in fig .",
    "it is evident that the lowest excitation occurs at @xmath57 .",
    "however , since the excitation energy is lower than 1 mev , we could not determine the excitation energy due to the incoherent scattering and the low energy resolution . in fig .",
    "5 , we substituted the gap energy @xmath58 mev , which was evaluated from the previous magnetization @xcite and esr measurements @xcite , for the excitation energy at @xmath57 . recently",
    "et al_. @xcite investigated the magnetic excitations in tlcucl@xmath0 by neutron inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "their experimental results along the @xmath23-and @xmath25-directions are in agreement with our results .    based on the present results , together with the previous ones ,",
    "it is evident that the periodicity of the magnetic excitation in tlcucl@xmath0 is the same as that of the nuclear reciprocal lattice along the @xmath23-axis , but doubled along the @xmath25-axis , as observed in kcucl@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hence , it is deduced that the lowest excitation occurs at @xmath4 with integer @xmath5 and odd @xmath6 in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "this is consistent with the results of recent neutron elastic scattering experiments in magnetic fields @xcite . when a magnetic field @xmath59 is applied in the present system , the single excitation splits into three excitations , since the excitation should be a triplet excitation .",
    "the lowest excitation energy decreases with increasing magnetic field , and finally becomes zero at the critical field @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "the system can undergo magnetic ordering due to three - dimensional ( 3d ) interactions .",
    "such field - induced magnetic ordering has actually been observed by neutron elastic scattering for @xmath62 and @xmath63 t @xcite .",
    "magnetic bragg reflections were observed at @xmath4 with integer @xmath5 and odd @xmath6 in the @xmath3 plane , and are equivalent to those for the lowest excitation at zero field .",
    "there is a sharp contrast between the dispersion curves for @xmath64 and @xmath28 which are roughly perpendicular to each other .",
    "the magnetic excitation is most dispersive along @xmath27 , which is parallel to the @xmath29 cleavage plane , and is less dispersive for @xmath2 perpendicular to it .",
    "the dispersion curve for @xmath64 has a local minimum at @xmath65 .",
    "this dispersion behavior is similar to that in kcucl@xmath0 , which implies that the principal exchange pathways in tlcucl@xmath0 should be the same as those in kcucl@xmath0 .",
    "however , the dispersion range in tlcucl@xmath0 ( @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 ) is much larger than that in kcucl@xmath0 ( @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath68 ) .",
    "this suggests that the exchange interactions in tlcucl@xmath0 are much stronger than those in kcucl@xmath0 .",
    "the details of the exchange interactions are evaluated in the next section .",
    "the main point in the analysis of the experimental results is that the magnetic interactions in tlcucl@xmath0 are dominated by the exchange between the two spins forming the planar @xmath71 dimer ( intradimer exchange ) , whereas exchange interactions between other spin pairs ( interdimer exchange ) can be considered as weaker .",
    "the strong antiferromagnetic intradimer interaction is the origin of the singlet ground state .    since",
    "notable anisotropy effects have not been observed in the static measurements of tlcucl@xmath0 @xcite , the full magnetic interactions will be described by the spin-@xmath17 heisenberg model    @xmath72    for the exchange interactions between spins , we will use the notation given in ref .",
    "@xcite : the main intradimer exchange is denoted as @xmath73 .",
    "the exchange interaction per bond between spins in dimers separated by a lattice vector @xmath74 is denoted as the exchange energy @xmath75 for pairs of spins at equivalent positions in their respective dimer and as @xmath76 for spins at inequivalent positions .",
    "finite values of interdimer interactions @xmath77 will be considered for the following exchange paths only : @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in",
    "the following we present an analysis of the lowest elementary triplet excitation based on this picture , in three steps .",
    "\\(i ) the simplest picture is to assume unperturbed propagation of the excitation of one dimer from the singlet to triplet state , neglecting the excitation of further triplets during propagation .",
    "this leads to the basic dispersion    @xmath80   \\nonumber \\\\   & & { \\pm } 2   [ j_{(1\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{2})}^{\\rm eff } { \\cos}\\{{\\pi}(2h+l)\\}{\\cos}({\\pi}k ) +    j_{(0\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{2})}^{\\rm eff } { \\cos}({\\pi}k){\\cos}({\\pi}l)\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this level , only certain combinations of the exchange interactions enter the dispersion law : these are known as effective dimer interactions :    @xmath81    the factor in front of the individual exchange constants @xmath73 and @xmath82 results from the number of identical exchange paths for the same lattice vector between dimers ; it is one of 1 ( identical exchange on two legs or on two diagonals ) , @xmath17 ( exchange on one diagonal only whereas there is no exchange path for the other diagonal ) or 0 ( the exchange path does not contribute ) .",
    "dispersion relation ( 2 ) is valid in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "since there are two different dimers per chemical unit cell , the dispersion law has two branches , distinguished by @xmath84 in eq.(2 ) .",
    "however , the structure factor at the zeroth order is of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the spin separations in the cu@xmath8cl@xmath11 dimers located at the corner and at the center of the unit cell in the @xmath14 plane . under the present experimental condition , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath2 in the @xmath3 plane , the @xmath88 branch gives the only nonvanishing contribution .",
    "hence , we can assume that the observed single excitation corresponds to the @xmath88 branch .",
    "\\(ii ) the simple approach ( i ) gives a qualitatively correct picture , which confirms the assumption of one dominating intradimer exchange interaction , quantitatively .",
    "however , it is not sufficient .",
    "the standard way to improve on this has been to treat the intermediate excitation of two or more triplets in an rpa - like approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation continues to treat dimers as units and results in the dispersion law @xmath89 this result depends only on the effective interactions @xmath90 ; the dispersion law does not distinguish between the contributions to the interdimer interactions from the different exchange paths .",
    "the measured dispersions were fitted to eq .",
    "( 6 ) using all the effective exchange constants given in eq .",
    "the results are presented in table ii .",
    "\\(iii ) a systematic approach to improve on the one triplet dispersion law of eq . ( 2 ) , is to expand the energy of the elementary triplet excitation order by order in the interdimer exchange interactions .",
    "the method has been described in @xcite , and it has been found that , from the second order , new terms which are not present in the expansion of the square root of eq . ( 6 ) appear . to determine individual exchange couplings ,",
    "we have implemented the cluster expansion technique @xcite to allow us to calculate one magnon dispersion relations up to the sixth order . for tractability ,",
    "only exchange paths along ( 100 ) , ( 201 ) and @xmath91 were taken into account , whereas the small ( as evident from approach ( ii ) ) interactions along ( 200 ) and @xmath92 were disregarded . due to the complex interaction structure , it was not possible to take into account only topologically different clusters , and we had to consider all embeddings , _",
    "i.e. _ , all the different ways of setting a given cluster on the lattice , up to the desired order .",
    "this leads to an exponentially growing number of cluster from order to order . in the present case ,",
    "we perform calculations for the sixth order treating 18084 colored clusters and 673826 embeddings .",
    "the series expansion gives the dispersion relation in the form @xmath93\\cos(\\pi",
    "n_k k),\\ ] ] where @xmath94 s are the individual exchange interactions in units of @xmath73 : @xmath95 leading terms in ( [ eq : seromega ] ) can be combined to an expansion of a square root , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the coefficients @xmath96 explicitly up to the fourth order , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath97 ; these coefficients are available up on request . up to the sixth order , we are able to obtain the dispersion numerically for a given parameter set @xmath98 . in order to demonstrate the convergence of the cluster expansion we show in fig .",
    "6 the results for increasing orders in the dimer expansion for the direction @xmath99 .    for the analysis of the data , we proceeded in two steps .",
    "we first performed a least - squares fit to the measured data using the analytically known dispersion to the fourth order with the intradimer interaction @xmath100 mev , which was obtained in ( ii ) .",
    "guided by the result of this fit , we performed calculations to the sixth order .",
    "the parameters for the best sixth order calculation are given in table iii .",
    "the solid lines in fig . 5 indicate the calculated results .",
    "the experimental dispersion curves can be reproduced well by the present calculation .    the results for the effective exchange constants are well defined and imply , in particular , a significant increase in the value of @xmath101 , when compared to the rpa - like approach ( ii ) above .",
    "the individual exchange constants are well defined for @xmath102 and @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath103 the individual exchange constants are determined less reliably .",
    "a fit of comparable accuracy is obtained for @xmath104 , @xmath105 and minor changes in the remaining parameters .",
    "similar to the situation in @xmath106 , the neighboring dimers couple magnetically along the chain and in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "the most important interdimer interaction is the diagonal @xmath107 interaction , which is about half of the intradimer interaction .",
    "we have presented the results of neutron inelastic scattering for the spin gap system tlcucl@xmath0 .",
    "well - defined magnetic excitation spectra were observed in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "the dispersion relations of the magnetic excitations in tlcucl@xmath0 were determined as shown in fig .",
    "5 , and were analyzed by the cluster series expansion .",
    "the individual exchange interactions , which could not be obtained from the effective dimer approximation , were evaluated , as shown in table iii .",
    "tlcucl@xmath0 is a strongly coupled spin - dimer system , in contrast to kcucl@xmath0 which is characterized as a weakly coupled spin - dimer system .",
    "the analysis of the individual exchange constants shows that the ladder system in @xmath108 , similar to @xmath106 , is much closer to an alternating spin chain than has been previously believed .",
