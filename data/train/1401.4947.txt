    "the transient turn - on dynamics of lasers is a topic which has received a considerable amount of attention over the years ( cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite ) , not only for the fundamental understanding of its evolution but also , and especially , for the importance that it represents in data encoding in telecommunications with directly - modulated semiconductor lasers . while multiple quantum well  @xcite ( or even quantum dot  @xcite ) lasers have been proven to possess a peculiar modal dynamics ",
    "modelled with the help of mutual nonlinear coupling and noise  @xcite , with a complex ginzburg - landau approach  @xcite or based on multiscale analysis  @xcite where the resulting model provides proof for a true phase instability  @xcite  , inexpensive , edge - emitting devices show a dynamics  @xcite which is more appropriately characterized by cooperation , rather than competition  @xcite .    for these latter devices ,",
    "we have recently shown  @xcite that a realistic model for a multimode semiconductor laser , with experimentally matched parameters  @xcite , predicts a slow , hidden dynamical mode - evolution governed by a master mode .",
    "an overall agreement exists between our recent predictions and a wealth of experimental data ( e.g.  @xcite ) since it has been time and again shown that a gradual line narrowing exists in the progress of the multimode laser transient ( cf . also previous theoretical calculations , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , no specific experiments seem to have been carried out to quantify the physical features of the multimode dynamics in edge - emitting semiconductor lasers ( beyond its more technical aspects ) , and the physical origin of our predictions concerning the slow components of the dynamics remain so far unexplained .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the deterministic dynamics of the multimode laser transient and determine the modal intensity distribution at the end of the fast transient starting from a below - threshold condition and leading into the slow dynamics  @xcite with the characteristic oscillations of a class - b laser  @xcite .",
    "the * apparent * _ equilibrium solution _ , taking place at the end of the fast transient , in reality amounts to an inherent _ out - of - equilibrium one _ , when analyzed in terms of modal intensity distribution .",
    "our interest for answering the questions related to this non - equilibrium intensity distribution is of a fundamental nature and extends , beyond strongly multimode semiconductor lasers , to all those other types of laser ",
    "e.g. fiber lasers  @xcite or solid state lasers  @xcite  which are characterized by the simultaneous operation , at least in transient , of a large number of longitudinal modes .    from the point of view of dynamical systems",
    ", our model can be viewed as an ensemble of globally coupled modes possessing a common , stable attractor .",
    "globally coupled systems have been , and are still , a topic receiving a large amount of attention given their potential for application to various fields ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "multimode lasers and laser arrays have been recognized very early on as interesting physical examples of globally coupled systems ( cf . , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . at variance with most other investigations , we do not study synchronization or the appearance of collective states , but the transient evolution towards a fixed point ( attractor ) by a collection of modes with unequal degrees of coupling to a global energy source . however , transient dynamics can become part of self - sustained dynamics if the system parameters are modulated on a time scale comparable to ( at least one ) of its internal constants .",
    "the results are non - trivial and show the existence of multiple time scales and of collective dynamics which contribute to a fast evolution ( studied in this paper ) , which precedes the slow , hidden dynamics already presented elsewhere  @xcite . the discussion is entirely cast in terms of laser physics , but , making abstraction from the direct physical meaning of the variables  i.e. , identifying the carrier number as a global coupling field and the laser modes as oscillators nonlinearly coupled to that ( mean ) field  , the results can be transposed to a generic dynamical system consisting of a large number of oscillators each individually coupled to a global field .",
    "the model is briefly discussed in section  [ modelsect ] and the transient evolution is analyzed in section  [ analysis ] , which is divided into three subsections .",
    "the first two provide a detailed analysis of the below - threshold , deterministic dynamics for the population  where an analytical solution can be found for the carrier density ( section  [ carrier - density ] )  and for the modal intensity distribution ",
    "describable in terms of approximate iterative analytical solutions ( section  [ decoupled - modes ] ) .",
    "this detailed analysis paves the way for the central point of the paper : the analysis of the strongly coupled ( multimode ) transient in the oscillatory regime ( section  [ strong - coupling ] ) .",
    "this regime , which displays the characteristic damped oscillations both in the carrier number and in the total intensity , connects the below - threshold dynamics with the slow modal one previously reported  @xcite .",
    "in particular , its final state  corresponding to the disappearance of oscillations in the carrier density and in the total laser intensity  is responsible for the ensuing , hidden modal dynamics  @xcite .",

    "the fast transient , leading to the intensity peak and the usual damped oscillations , can be divided into two parts . a first one , where the carrier number @xmath1 can be decoupled from the modal intensities @xmath16 s , and a second one where  due to the strong coupling  the fully nonlinear system must be retained .    in the decoupled regime",
    ", the carrier number plays the role of an energy reservoir , virtually unaffected by the presence of the laser modes ( too weak to have an impact on the carriers ) .",
    "thus , it is possible to find an analytical solution for its evolution  starting from an initial condition  towards a transient final state defined by the breakdown of this approximation ( section  [ carrier - density ] ) . in this regime ,",
    "the modal intensities are decoupled from one another ( section  [ decoupled - modes ] ) and evolve under the action of the ( time - dependent ) energy reservoir , @xmath1 , whose behaviour has been analytically obtained with good accuracy in section  [ carrier - density ] .",
    "this approximate but accurate treatment allows us to define a  threshold \" for the multimode laser ( including spontaneous emission ) in analogy with a basic single mode laser model , where spontaneous emission is traditionally neglected  @xcite .",
    "the strongly coupled regime is analyzed in detail in section  [ strong - coupling ] on the basis of the knowledge acquired in sections  [ carrier - density ] and  [ decoupled - modes ] and of _ ad hoc _ considerations .",
    "the analysis of the fast transient is best conducted by choosing an initial state with the laser ( almost ) entirely off . a small amount of prebias ( @xmath52 , well below the lasing threshold  @xcite which is placed around @xmath53 ) is useful since it provides an average contribution of the spontaneous emission to each mode , without having to wait for the carrier number to grow .",
    "this choice is not restrictive and does not limit the validity of our results .",
    "our analysis holds any time the laser starts from an injection current value below threshold , which corresponds to an initial energy repartition among modes which strongly differs from the final one , above threshold .",
    "if instead the laser is already pumped above threshold and we suddenly change its pump to another value above threshold  @xcite , the ensuing dynamics will reflect the slow modal intensity redistribution examined in  @xcite .",
    "a good understanding of the initial phases of the laser turn - on requires a description , even though approximate , of its evolution away from noise .",
    "a good deal of work has been dedicated to an analytical or semi - analytical description of this question  @xcite . in the following",

    "the quantitative comparison will show that the analytical approximation provides excellent results even in the initial stages of the transient when the e.m .",
    "field intensity reaches relatively high values , i.e. , exactly where one would expect the approximate solution to already fail .",
    "the contribution of the spontaneous emission ( intrinsic noise ) to each mode is quite small . as a first approximation",

    "the initial positivity of the relative deviation,@xmath78 , resides in the fact that the full solution requires a somewhat larger initial carrier number to support the different field modes , while in the approximate form no energy is lost to support them .",
    "the switch in sign in the difference between the exact and the approximate value for the carrier number comes from the fact that once the different lasing modes grow sufficiently large , the carrier number saturates , instead of continuing its growth , as in the approximate expression .",

    ", this value sets the upper limit to the carrier number for which we can consider its dynamics decoupled from that of the modal intensities ( when growing out of noise ) , thus we can extend the concept of  threshold \" even in the presence of spontaneous emission .",
    "we begin this section with an overview of the modal dynamics during the transient evolution , regardless of the degree of coupling with the carrier number .",
    "this allows us to get a general picture , which we then refine in the analysis of the decoupled regime ( this section ) and of the strongly coupled one ( next section ) .",
    "the individual mode traces in fig .",
    "[ time - trace ] show that at short times the lateral modes contribute more than their steady state share .",
    "their peak ( cf . , e.g. , curves ( f ) and ( g ) corresponding to modes 5 and 7 places away from line center ) is much higher than the asymptotic intensity towards which they tend , contrary to those modes close to line center ( for the central mode even the peak intensity is lower than its steady state value )  @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that a mechanism must exist for these modes to grow , in transient , well beyond their final value , while the very few central modes do not .",

    "the inset shows that below threshold @xmath86 ( c ) gives a contribution larger than that of the central mode ( a )  until @xmath87  and that after a small maximum , at @xmath88 , it drops down again .",
    "thus , the influence of the very far modes is of some importance only in the very first phases of the dynamics .",
    "considering , though , that these modes are very far out in the wings and that their asymptotic value is order of magnitudes lower than that of the central mode , their strong influence on the dynamics up to threshold is an indicator of the essential difference between the transient intensity distribution and the asymptotic one !    the picture changes more dramatically if we include the lateral modes , @xmath82 , which carry little energy at steady state ( globally of the order of 3% of the total intensity ) , but which in transient give a cumulative peak larger than the one of the central mode ( curve ( b ) ) .",
    "this contribution is rather striking .",
    "indeed , it displays a faster growth than the central mode and deformed ( incomplete ) oscillations .",
    "the latter are explained by the fact that the effective relaxation frequency is not constant over the whole set of modes ( cf .",
    "@xcite for discussion on a slightly different model and section  [ strong - coupling ] , in this paper ) , thus the sum over the ensemble deforms and attenuates the oscillations .",
    "the substantial contribution of @xmath82 to the peak in transient is a consequence of the observation that in the initial phases of the dynamics the lateral modes contribute , relatively , much more than they do at steady state ( or at least on the long time scales ) .",
