    "ab - initio electronic structure theory for bulk materials has experienced tremendous advances in many areas such as density functional theory @xcite , improved post - dft @xcite and , e.g. , van der waals functionals,@xcite as well as highly accurate quantum chemical @xcite and monte - carlo approaches@xcite .",
    "however , many problems are still out of reach of an advanced theoretical description due to their size : the accurate description of , for example , defect structures requires both a highly accurate treatment of the local defect region , as well as the treatment of a large number of atoms of the environment@xcite .",
    "it is often challenging for a single method to meet both requirements .",
    "embedding is therefore a suitable strategy to evercome this hurdle .",
    "its underlying idea is to treat the local structure or , more generally , the subsystem of interest by a high - level method while treating the environment with the help of a numerically less demanding lower level method . consistently combining different electronic structure methods within the same calculation",
    "is both the advantage and the challenge of the embedding approach @xcite .",
    "several embedding schemes have been proposed @xcite , relying either on some form of a local embedding potential @xmath0 that mediates the interaction between the subsystem referred in the following as the cluster and the surrounding environment .",
    "more elaborate operator - based approaches @xcite introduce a nonlocal embedding @xmath1 .",
    "typically , subsystems are treated in the presence of @xmath0 [ or @xmath2 using a high - level method , while the entire system is handled by density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the individual subsystem densities are then added to obtain an approximation for the total density of the entire system . while conceptually simpler , local embedding potentials feature the distinct disadvantage that no set of mutually orthogonal orbitals of the entire system exists",
    ". consequently , evaluation of the total energy becomes challenging : in particular the kinetic energy needs to be approximated .",
    "huang et al .",
    "@xcite used an optimized effective potential method to recover the kinetic energy given a total electron density .",
    "conversely , fornace et al . presented an embedded mean - field theory @xcite partitioning the one - particle density matrix of the system based on its basis functions .",
    "a single hamiltonian then describes the entire system , avoiding any issues with evaluating the kinetic energy for cluster and environment separately .",
    "additionally , this approach , by construction , allows for direct charge exchange between the cluster of interest and the environment .",
    "however , a direct extension to plane - wave basis sets used in periodic solid state computations seems challenging .",
    "goodpaster et al .",
    "@xcite have presented a scheme relying on projection operators to ensure mutual orthogonality of orbitals belonging to different subsystems . in the present article ,",
    "we present an alternative strategy to generate and maintain mutually orthogonal orbitals for the subsystems throughout the calculation .",
    "we determine wannier - like orbitals localized within the cluster by performing unitary rotations within the subspace of fully occupied kohn - sham orbitals while the orthogonal complement of remaining orbitals resides within the environment @xcite . during the optimization cycle for the cluster involving an advanced functional , the environment orbitals remain frozen and thus orthogonality",
    "is preserved .",
    "this approach avoids the inaccuracies associated with approximating the kinetic energy .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate the power of our embedding scheme in a proof - of - principle calculation adressing two problems for which standard kohn - sham dft is known to be inadequate : defects in silicon and polarons in titania .",
    "we use the following hierarchy of methods : the cluster is treated by the ( expensive ) hybrid functional pbeh while the environment is treated only by the pbe functional .",
    "we show that this embedding scheme implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( ` vasp ` ) is robust and efficient .",
    "we emphasize that the present embedding scheme is not limited to hybrid - dft in dft embeddings .",
    "future extensions will adress the treatment of the cluster by rpa or quantum chemistry approaches .",
    "we partition a system into two parts : a cluster of interest @xmath3 with atomic sites @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 ) with @xmath6 the number of atomic sites included in the cluster , and the surounding environment @xmath7 , containing @xmath8 atomic sites @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 ) . in a first step , the entire system ( @xmath11 )",
    "is solved using a single , comparatively cheap exchange - correlation functional , e.g. , pbe @xcite , @xmath12 yielding kohn - sham orbitals @xmath13 with orbital energies @xmath14 and the density matrix @xmath15 with occupation numbers @xmath16 $ ] , where the index @xmath17 goes over all orbitals and physical spin . note that we we have not included @xmath18-point sampling in the present ansatz , since it is not straightforward to treat the transformations at different @xmath18-points independently .",
    "we aim to find a unitary rotation within the subspace of fully occupied orbitals ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) that yields a set of orbitals aligned with the atomic orbitals @xmath21 localized around the atomic sites of the cluster .",
    "the index @xmath22 of the atomic orbitals includes both the site index as well as radial and angular momentum quantum numbers . to this end",
    "we apply to the orbital overlap matrix w , @xmath23 a singular value decomposition according to @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath26 represents the rotation in the space of the @xmath27 occupied orbitals that optimally aligns @xmath28 of these orbitals with the atomic orbitals @xmath29 keeping the remaining @xmath30 orbitals orthogonal . the singular values @xmath31 provide a measure for the degree of overlap between the orbitals @xmath29 and the rotated orbitals @xmath32 , @xmath33 orbitals with indices @xmath34 outside the space of occupied orbitals are unaffected by the rotation , @xmath35 . using the rotated @xmath32 , we can thus partition the occupied space into orbitals which have an overlap with the @xmath29 , and those who do not .",
    "ideally , if the kohn sham orbitals are well covered by the atomic wavefunctions , we expect the singular values @xmath31 to be close to 1 .",
    "after the orbital rotations , a subset @xmath36 of those @xmath37 with @xmath38 can now be optimized based on a more expensive exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional @xmath39 , e.g. , a hybrid functional @xcite , while freezing the orthogonal complement of @xmath40 environment orbitals @xmath41 . in general",
    ", the number of orbitals @xmath42 used in the embedding procedure may be smaller than the number of atomic basis functions @xmath28 : in principle , one may choose any subset of the localized orbitals @xmath43 .",
    "in practice , we sort the rotated orbitals by their singular values @xmath31 , and choose the @xmath42 orbitals corresponding to the largest @xmath31 , where @xmath42 is chosen according to the number of orbitals of interest within the cluster .",
    "a typical cut - off will be @xmath44 .",
    "we find that our results do not strongly depend on @xmath42 , as long as the number of optimized orbitals is sufficiently large as to properly describe the local bonding .",
    "we will discuss the choice of @xmath42 in more detail in the results section below .",
    "note that after the orbital rotation , the @xmath32 are no longer eigenvectors of the kohn - sham hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "the diagonals of the hamiltonian are given by the expectation values @xmath46 related to the original eigenvalues through the invariance of the trace @xmath47 under unitary rotations .",
    "in the case of fractional occupations of some of the orbitals in @xmath48 , the above considerations remain valid in the subspace of the @xmath49 fully occupied orbitals . all orbitals with fractional occupation",
    "are assigned to cluster @xmath3 , even if they are not well localized .",
    "however , extension of the present approach to quantum - chemistry based correlated wavefunction approaches may face difficulties for such delocalized metallic states .",
    "taking into consideration that different exchange - correlation functionals will be employed for the cluster @xmath3 and the environment @xmath7 we write the energy functional for the entire system @xmath11 as @xmath50 + e_{{\\mathrm{xc}}}[\\gamma_a,\\gamma_b]\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the density , and @xmath52 $ ] the hartree energy @xmath53 = \\frac 12 \\sum_{i , j=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{tot}}}f_if_j{\\left < i\\;j \\right|}\\mathcal{c}{\\left| i\\ ; j \\right>},\\ ] ] with @xmath54 denoting the coulomb operator . the mixed exchange - correlation",
    "functional @xmath55 $ ] containing both the lower ( @xmath7 ) and higher ( @xmath3 ) level functionals can be written as @xmath56 =   e_{xc}^a[\\gamma_a ] + e_{{\\mathrm{xc}}}^b[\\gamma_b ] + e^{\\mathrm{int}}_{{\\mathrm{xc}}}[\\gamma_a,\\gamma_b].\\ ] ] to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : xcab ] ) in practice within our embedding approach , the contribution due to the interaction between the two subsystems , @xmath57 , should be approximated by the lower - level functional ( @xmath7 ) applied also to the environment , i.e. , @xmath58 = e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{int},b}[\\gamma_a,\\gamma_b]$ ] with @xmath59 = e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{b}[\\gamma_{\\mathrm{tot } } ] - e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^b[\\gamma_a ] - e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^b[\\gamma_b]\\ ] ] this allows for very expensive functionals to be used in the cluster @xmath3 , including rpa or quantum chemistry approaches .",
    "the drawback is that the error introduced in such a mixed approach is difficult to quantify a priori .",
    "for the special case of hybrid functionals chosen in the present work as the `` higher - level '' functional @xmath3 the interaction term @xmath57 can be much more accurately approximated by the full hybrid functional itself @xmath60 & = & e_{{\\mathrm{xc}}}^a[\\gamma_a+\\gamma_b ] - e_{{\\mathrm{xc}}}^a[\\gamma_a ] - e_{{\\mathrm{xc}}}^b[\\rho_b ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the most expensive summation @xmath61 is constant and hence not relevant for the optimization of orbitals in @xmath3 .",
    "the only approximation here is that the orbitals in @xmath7 are kept frozen .",
    "even when optimizing large supercells , only a subset @xmath62 of the full @xmath63 orbital pairings needs to be calculated to evaluate the relevant exchange contribution @xmath64 , greatly reducing the numerical effort .",
    "the orbitals in @xmath3 can now be efficiently optimized minimizing the energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ eq : etotal ] ) , while the orbitals in @xmath7 are kept frozen . consequently , during a single optimization , any change in the electronic structure of @xmath3 due to",
    "a more accurate xc functional can not lead to a redistribution of charge in @xmath7 .",
    "the embedding can now be made self - consistent by alternating between subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath7 in freeze - and - thaw cycles : after the initial solution of the entire system using the lower - level functional , an orbital rotation is performed to partition into orbital sets @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "then , starting with @xmath3 , alternatingly one of the subsystems is optimized while the other one is kept frozen .",
    "each cycle that optimizes the orbitals @xmath3 uses the higher - level xc functional @xmath3 while each cycle that optimizes the orbitals in @xmath7 employs the lower - level functional @xmath7 .",
    "for the example of polarons in titania discussed below , we find rapid convergence after about six freeze - and - thaw cycles @xcite .",
    "since the interaction of the cluster region ( e.g. defect ) with its periodic image needs to be minimized , conventional defect modeling is hampered by the requirement of large supercells .",
    "if the bulk material could well be described by conventional xc functionals , and only the defect structure requires more advanced techniques , conventional techniques still require an expensive evaluation of the entire exchange contribution . the embedding procedure outlined above",
    "is ideally suited to significantly reduce computational effort while retaining high accuracy .",
    "we have implemented the embedding scheme outlined above in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( ` vasp ` ) using the projector augmented wave method of blchl in the implementation of kresse and joubert@xcite .",
    "usage is simple : in a first step , a conventional dft calculation of a system is performed . in a second step , the localized atomic basis functions @xmath29 are defined .",
    "our implementation currently supports the paw basis functions ( the pseudo partial waves ) and standard spherical harmonics ( including hybrid orbitals such as @xmath65 ) with the radial dependence taken from suitably scaled hydrogen functions . `",
    "vasp ` then starts an embedded calculation , performs the orbital rotation and optimizes the set of @xmath66 orbitals localized on the cluster @xmath3 while the remaining fully occupied kohn - sham orbitals of the environment @xmath7 are frozen ( for spin - polarized calculations the two spin components are handled independently in terms of the rotation and the number of optimized orbitals ) . during the freeze - and - thaw cycles , no further localization procedure according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotation ] ) is required , and orbital sets @xmath3 and @xmath7 are interchanged . to enforce orthogonality between the currently optimized orbitals and the frozen environment we use the frozen orbitals as projector .",
    "we do not currently support @xmath18-point sampling in the embedding calculation , since the orbital rotations at different @xmath18-points are not independent .",
    "likewise , forces are not currently implemented in our formalism .",
    "the geometries used in this work were taken from ref .",
    "for the defects in silicon and where relaxed using the hse functional similar to ref .   for the polarons in titania",

    "we benchmark our embedding approximation against a fully self consistent optimization of all orbitals using the hybrid functional .",
    "additionally , we compare against evaluating the hybrid functional with orbitals obtained from using a conventional functional ( pbe ) .",
    "obviously , both the embedded and the pbe orbitals are , by construction , not self - consistent with respect to the hybrid functional . in comparison with a full self - consistent optimization , a single evaluation step using the full hybrid functional with non - self consistent orbitals takes a small amount of time , while substantially improving the accuracy : errors in an inexact evaluation of the interaction between subsystems in eq .",

    "we use a 64 atom supercell , and neglect @xmath18-point sampling both in the full hybrid benchmark and in the embedding calculations . due to the localized nature of the covalent bonds",
    "involved , conventional kohn - sham dft fails to correctly reproduce experimental observations . by using hybrid functionals or even more advanced rpa formulations",
    "@xcite , these problems are mitigated .",
    "however , comparison with more accurate correlation functionals such as rpa and experiment show that currently available methods yield a wide range of predictions depending on the employed functional @xcite , highlighting the necessity to move towards higher level correlated wavefunction approaches .    due to the large supercells required to avoid interaction of the defect sites with their periodic images , embedding the orbitals close to",
    "the defect site seems desirable .",
    "as benchmark for our embedding scheme , we consider defect formation energies of a set of common interstitial defects and vacancies .",
    "we aim to reproduce the energetics of full hybrid functional calculations based on pbeh by a cheaper embedding calculation in which only a few ( six to ten ) orbitals localized in the immediate vicinity of the defect ( taken to be the @xmath3 orbitals of the cluster ) are treated using the hybrid functional , while the remaining  118 - 122 orbitals ( taken to be the @xmath7 orbitals ) are only treated by pbe .",
    "we also compare our results to purely dft - based predictions .    for all si defect calculations , we choose as atomic orbitals @xmath29 the paw pseudo - partial waves of the si atoms at and directly adjacent to the defect site , resulting in @xmath70 ( vacancies ) or 20 atomic basis functions ( 1 @xmath71 + 3 @xmath72 per atom ) for most cases .",
    "increasing the number of basis functions per atom increases the overall overlap of the occupied kohn - sham orbitals with the defect site at the cost of a larger @xmath28 , and thus a larger overlap matrix @xmath73 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "consequently , the number of singular values @xmath31 increases . to obtain a set of orbitals well localized at the defect site , we choose all orbitals with singular values @xmath44 as embedded orbitals .",
    "this procedure yields a number of selected embedded orbitals @xmath42 from 9 ( x defect ) to 16 ( t - defect ) , in line with the number of si - si bonds one would expect for the respective defect sites .",
    "for example , each of the two defects atoms of the dumpbell defect ( x ) interacts strongly with four close neighbors in the surrounding lattice and with the other atom in the dumpbell , yielding a total of nine covalent bonds .",
    "indeed , we find nine singular values substantially larger than 0.5 for this defect .",
    "the paw basis functions we choose yield a set of orbitals with a bimodal distribution : a significant number of orbitals with @xmath74 , well seperated from delocalized orbitals with small overlap @xmath75 with the defect site .",
    "the threshold of 0.5 is therefore a good compromise between choosing all @xmath28 possible orbitals ( which will include orbitals with very small singular values ) and too few orbitals that will not allow for reasonable optimization .",
    "note , however , that care must be taken to check that there are no singular values close to 0.5 , to avoid arbitrarily including ( or discarding ) orbitals upon small fluctuations in @xmath31 .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , calculating the defect formation energies from the total energies of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : estart])-([eq : excint ] ) for the defects and the defect - free ( bulk ) system proves challenging . for the embedded case , vacancies and interstitials change the number of orbitals , and",
    "make a comparison of absolute energies problematic .",
    "we therefore compare the predictions by different methods for the formation energies by evaluating the same hybrid energy functional with the help of all orbitals ( i.e. , not just the ones localized at the defect ) generated by the different methods [ denoted by an asterisk ( * ) ] .",
    "our results for various defect structures are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : resultsdefects ] .",
    "overall , we find excellent agreement between the hybrid functional benchmark and our embedding approach . for simple , non - metallic defects such as the dumbbell configuration ( x ) , the hexagonal hollow ( h ) and a lower - symmetry variant ( c@xmath68 ) we find that both the embedding , as well as the evaluation of the hybrid functional with the low - level dft orbitals produces good agreement with benchmark calculations ( see second column of tab .  [ tab : resultsdefects ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the metallic tetragonal site is badly described by dft : it features one interstitial si atom coordinated to its four nearest neighbors , so that the local coordination of the interstitial is identical to the other si atoms .",
    "this position is unique insofar that the highest occupied orbital is threefold degenerate ( @xmath76 symmetry ) but only occupied by two electrons .",
    "this degeneracy is preserved in dft yielding three fractionally occupied orbitals with occupation numbers @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , the evaluation of the hybrid energy functional based on these orbitals fails to yield reasonable formation energies .",
    "by contrast , the embedding method locally breaks the degeneracy as does the full hybrid calculation , leading to good agreement of the embedding results with the benchmark ( see t , vjt and v lines in tab .",
    "[ tab : resultsdefects ] ) .",
    "our results compare poorly with experimental data : one important reason is the interaction of periodic images of the defects to the supercell size .",
    "we therefore consider a larger supercell of 512 atoms , still with a single defect .",
    "we note that on our hardware , the full hybrid calculations takes ten times as long as the embedded one , with a relative error of 0.4% in total energy .",
    "we find a substantial change in results for the larger cell ( compare tab .",
    "[ tab : resultsdefectslarge ] ) , that now fit well to experimental results for the h defect . to achieve better agreement also for vacancies ( v )",
    "requires a more accurate treatment of electronic correlation ( e.g. , rpa ) or inclusion of van der waals contributions @xcite .",
    ".same comparison as in tab .",
    "[ tab : resultsdefects ] for an eight times larger supercell containing 512 atoms .",
    "rightmost column shows the range of available experimental data taken from [ ] . [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     as a second demonstration of our method , we consider the formation of polarons in titania .",
    "we consider a @xmath78 supercell with 24 ti and 28 o atoms in the rutile structure . in an accurate hybrid functional description , an additional electron localizes , distorting the lattice and forming a small polaron .",
    "the distortion decreases the energy compared to a delocalized charge .",
    "a full hybrid functional calculation yields a decrease in energy by 514 mev for the distorted geometry .",
    "we will use this value in the following as benchmark for our embedded description of the polaron .",
    "concerning the atomic basis functions @xmath29 used for the initial localization , we typically use the 1 @xmath71 and 5 @xmath79 orbitals of the ti atom centered at the small polaron deformation , as well as all @xmath71 and @xmath72 orbitals of the six nearest neighbor oxygen atoms , yielding a total of @xmath80 orbitals .",
    "geometries for the distorted structure were relaxed using hse calculations .",
    "our results for the small polaron formation energy are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : selfcons ] .",
    "conventional density functional theory invoking a pbe functional is not capable of reproducing small polaron formation , predicting even a negative energy gain ( i.e. energy costs ) of -355 mev to form the polaron . inserting the dft orbitals in the hybrid energy functional leads to a correction of the sign .",
    "however the energy gain is underestimated by a factor of two ( 270 mev ) , see tab .",
    "[ tab : selfcons ] .",
    "a single - cycle embedding calculation yields a slightly larger error predicting 190 mev .",
    "the origin of this error is obvious : while the hybrid functional tries to localize the charge in the cluster region @xmath3 , the surrounding region @xmath7 can not react to the substantial change in the electrostatics , since all @xmath7 orbitals are frozen .",
    "subsequent freeze - and - thaw cycles rapidly improve the result : we alternate between optimizing the two sets of orbitals @xmath3 and @xmath7 , one with the expensive hybrid , the other with pure gga ( pbe ) .",
    "we find convergence in about seven iterations , quite independent of the number of embedded orbitals @xmath42 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : selfcons ] ) . as minimum requirement for @xmath42 , the ti atom at the center of the distortion and the surrounding oxygen atoms need to be treated accurately , which is already achieved with as few as six orbitals ( tab .",
    "[ tab : selfcons ] ) .",
    "note that only choosing the central ti atom as atomic basis , @xmath81 , yields a smaller polaron energy than chosing the six orbitals with the highest singular values from the @xmath80 localized orbitals including also the closest oxygen atoms .",
    "the reason is that in the latter case , the response of the surrounding shell of oxygen atoms is - to some degree - also treated by the hybrid functional .",
    "however , further increasing the number of localized orbitals @xmath28 by , e.g. , also including a shell of neighboring ti atoms does not result in a stronger overlap of @xmath3 orbitals on the central ti atom ( note that the localization procedure does not distinguish between the different atomic basis functions @xmath29 ) .",
    "consequently , such a large @xmath28 would require a comparatively large @xmath42 to ensure that orbitals close to the central site are included in the embedded calculation .",
    "otherwise accuracy is lost .",
    "indeed , we find a better agreement with the benchmark for @xmath82 than for @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : selfcons ] ) .",
    "since the numerical effort of the embedding calculation scales with a power of @xmath42 , in practice a small @xmath28 that allows for @xmath85 is preferable .",
    "it is intstructive to follow the charge density variations along the freeze - and - thaw cycles [ fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] ] .",
    "additional charge is localized in the @xmath3 cycles using the hybrid funcional in the cluster ( top row in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] ) .",
    "the density spreads out again and the environment relaxes in the @xmath7 cycles when the orbitals @xmath7 of the environment are optimized using the dft functional .",
    "however , the magnitude of these changes quickly decreases with the iteration number and yields a well - converged density ( and well - converged energy ) within 7 iterations .    the full hybrid and the converged embedded unpaired spin densities closely match ( fig .",
    "[ fig : methodcomp ] ) ( b , c ) .",
    "by contrast , the dft density does not show a strong localization of the surplus electron at all ( fig .",
    "[ fig : methodcomp ] ) ( a ) . indeed , projecting the converged polaron orbital ( i.e.",
    ", the occupied majority spin kohn - sham orbital with the highest energy ) onto the central ti atom of the distortion yields quite small values for the overlap ( 0.39 ) for dft , while the full hybrid ( 0.69 ) and embedded calculations ( 0.65 ) agree quite well .",
    "this underlines that despite the correct sign for the energy gain when using the dft orbitals in the hybrid energy functional , the dft description of the charge density is qualitatively deficient .",
    "we have demonstrated a new embedding framework based on a suitable rotation in the subspace of fully occupied kohn - sham orbitals . using a projection on local basis functions ,",
    "a set of orbitals may be localized at a site of interest , for example a defect .",
    "subsequently , these localized orbitals inside the cluster can now be optimized based on a more expensive exchange - correlation functional , such as a hybrid functional involving the exact evaluation of fock exchange . since exchange interactions within the frozen environment",
    "are neglected , the computation time is drastically reduced .",
    "the response of the environment to the charge rearrangement in the cluster can be self - consistently included by freeze - thaw cycles in which alternatingly the orbitals in the embedded cluster or in the environment are optimized .",
    "we have implemented our ansatz in the popular ` vasp ` software package .",
    "as proof of principle , we have applied our method to two problems of interest : a set of defects in bulk silicon , and small polarons in bulk titania .",
    "we find excellent agreement with ( much more expensive ) benchmark bulk hybrid calculations .",
