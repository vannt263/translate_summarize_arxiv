    "the novel type of quantum metamaterials @xcite composed of arrays of superconducting two - level systems ( qubits ) offers a platform for quantum simulators and quantum memories @xcite .",
    "quantum metamaterials can be employed as test bench for studies of fundamental phenomena as ensemble quantum electrodynamics and spin resonance physics on macroscopic level @xcite .",
    "the flux qubit @xcite , which can be viewed as a artificial atom @xcite , is a @xmath0m - sized superconducting loop with several josephson junctions acting as nonlinear circuit elements .",
    "the strongly anharmonic potential of the flux qubit results in an effective two - level structure of the lowest pair of energy levels of the system , where the excitation frequencies fall into ghz range .",
    "ground and excited levels of the qubit correspond to quantum superpositions of states with opposite directions of macroscopic persistent currents in the qubit loop .",
    "when coupled to a photon field in a superconducting cavity , the qubit becomes `` dressed '' with photons .",
    "the experimental studies of superconducting qubit - cavity quantum electrodynamics have shown vacuum rabi oscillations @xcite , spin echo and ramsey fringes @xcite , emission of single microwave photons @xcite , and lamb shift @xcite .    while the artificially made ensembles of superconducting qubits have an unavoidable spread of excitation frequencies , in contrast to identical natural atoms , they are easily tunable by varying an external magnetic flux .",
    "this fact makes possible observation of the fundamental phenomena as dynamical casimir effect by applying of a non - stationary external drive @xcite , under which ghz photons are created from cavity vacuum fluctuations . in case of the multi - qubit system",
    ", a cm - long cavity is used as a transmission line where the virtual photon exchange provides a long - range qubit - qubit interaction in a sub - wavelength metamaterial .",
    "it was shown by tavis and cummings @xcite that @xmath1 identical two - level systems coupled to the single photon mode generate a collective enhancement of the coupling constant proportional to @xmath2 . in a qubit array with disordered values of excitation frequencies photons",
    "are also coupled to a collective superradiant mode and decoupled from other @xmath3 subradiant modes . collective enhancement combined with a possibility of tuning the parameters of",
    "the metamaterial by external magnetic field opens new possibilities for quantum information technology .",
    "for example , it has been suggested , that by applying gradients of magnetic field along the array of qubits , the system can be operated as a quantum memory with information encoded in collective qubit states @xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by recent experiments by macha et al .",
    "@xcite where the collective states of an array of superconducting flux qubits were probed by microwave photons transmitted through the resonator , in the regime of relatively strong decoherence and disorder in qubit excitation frequencies .",
    "the experiment has shown that resonant photon phase shift effect is quite prominent and stable against the decoherence .",
    "we perform simulations of the phase shift as a function of external flux that modifies the qubit excitation energies , in the setting similar to ref . @xcite . in our approach",
    ", we perform a diagonalization of the hamiltonian in a single excitation basis .",
    "we analyze the phase shift portrait for different number of qubits and various values of disorder in qubit excitation frequencies .",
    "we show that photon phase shift measurements are capable to resolve individual resonances for up to @xmath4 qubits .",
    "our simulations closely reproduce the experimental observations .",
    "considering the interaction of @xmath1 qubits with a photon in a resonator ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) , we start from the tavis - cummings hamiltonian , which includes qubit - qubit interaction term @xmath5 bosonic operators @xmath6 in ( [ h0 ] ) correspond to the photon mode @xmath7 in the cavity and the single @xmath8-th qubit is described in terms of uppering and lowering pauli operators @xmath9 acting on its ground and excited states . the first and the second terms in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) correspond to photon and qubit excitations of frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath10 , the third one is qubit - cavity coupling written in rotating wave approximation .",
    "the last term is an effective direct nearest neighbor qubit - qubit interaction .",
    "sketch of quantum metamaterial formed by an array of flux qubits embedded into a microwave resonator . ]",
    "the qubit excitation frequency @xmath11 follows from microscopic josephson and charging energies , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which imply @xmath14 in the operating regime of flux qubit .",
    "when the external magnetic flux threading the qubit loop is equal to half of the magnetic flux quantum @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , the total energy of the qubit has two symmetric minima related to the opposite circulations of persistent currents @xmath17 and @xmath18 where the tunneling rate @xmath19 between two wells depends on @xmath12 and @xmath20 . the condition that @xmath19 is higher than dephasing rate @xmath21 allows for quantum superpositions of @xmath17 and @xmath18 resulting in two non - degenerate states @xmath22 being the basis of ( [ h0 ] ) . by detuning the magnetic flux from @xmath15 one",
    "shifts the two minima by the energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath8-th qubit nominal current @xcite .",
    "the excitation frequency of @xmath8-th qubit is given by the floquet relation @xmath25 the qubit - cavity coupling constants in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) are renormalized bare constants @xmath26 written in the rotated basis @xmath22 .",
    "everywhere below we work with the effective constants . under uniform flux biasing conditions ,",
    "the spread in @xmath10 depends mainly on qubit excitation gaps @xmath27 , rather than @xmath24 , due to exponential dependence of @xmath28 on the @xmath29 ratio which fluctuates from one flux qubit to another .",
    "the system under consideration @xcite is strongly disordered because the spread of excitation gaps @xmath27 is estimated as high as @xmath30 .",
    "the system has an intermediate collective coupling strength value @xmath31 , which is smaller than decoherence rate @xmath21 but larger than relaxation rate @xmath32 of the cavity @xmath33 in the experiment by macha et al .",
    "@xcite , the external magnetic flux @xmath34 tunes qubit excitation frequencies in resonance with the cavity mode providing the shift of the phase @xmath35 of a weak external probe signal at cavity mode frequency @xmath36 ghz . from the measured @xmath35",
    "it was found that number of qubits in an ensemble , which form a collective mode , corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "relevant parameters of the studied metamaterial are the following : qubit - cavity coupling strength @xmath38 mhz , dephasing @xmath39 mhz , persistent current @xmath40 na and average value of the excitation gap @xmath41 ghz .",
    "the qubit - qubit interaction , estimated as @xmath42 mhz , has negligible effect on @xmath35 .",
    "the interaction only slightly shifts energies of collective states and does not contribute directly to the collective qubit - cavity coupling strength @xmath31 , which is the most relevant for the phase shift .",
    "the qubit dephasing in the system under consideration leads to smearing of the photon density of states which becomes not informative .",
    "however , the experimentally measured phase locking effect is quite prominent @xcite . in our work here , we focus on the influence of relatively large diagonal disorder in the qubit excitation frequencies and their number @xmath1 on the phase shift @xmath35 of the transmitted photons .",
    "we calculate the phase shift from a complex phase of the photon green function @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the probe frequency and @xmath34 is the external flux , counted from the symmetry point value @xmath45 , which shifts all excitation energies in the qubit ensemble .",
    "considering approximately resonant regime where the excitation frequencies of qubits and resonator mode are close to each other @xmath46 we find a spectrum of the system in a regime of single excitation by means of exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "this regime is realized under experimental conditions due to small microwave probe power and low temperature of the system .",
    "our solution corresponds to the fully quantum regime where all the variables @xmath47 are quantum fields .",
    "below we introduce the basis of @xmath48 states of approximately equal energies which are related to single excitation either in the photon cavity or in one of @xmath1 qubits .",
    "namely , the state where a single photon is excited and all qubits are in the ground state reads @xmath49-st , @xmath8-th or @xmath1-th qubits without the photon are given by @xmath50    @xmath51 and @xmath52 the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) in a matrix form @xmath53 in terms of this single excitation basis @xmath54 reads    @xmath55 . \\ ] ] the photon green function @xmath56 is given by the first diagonal @xmath57 element of the resolvent matrix @xmath58 @xmath59^{-1}.\\ ] ] this is the matrix of retarded green functions , where the last term @xmath60 introduced in order to take into account the damping in the cavity @xmath61 khz and dephasing of qubits .",
    "we note that the above expression for the photon green function @xmath56 and @xmath62 allowing us to calculate the phase shift coincides with the generic equations obtained earlier by volkov and fistul @xcite .",
    "in our numerical studies , we model the system with large amount of qubits and in the presence of disorder between them .",
    "namely , we fix metamaterial parameters and plot the phase shift increasing qubit number @xmath1 , but keeping spread of @xmath27 constant , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and vice versa , see fig .",
    "the reported results for the @xmath35 are obtained at the experimental values @xmath63 ghz , @xmath64 na and the following parameters : decoherence rate @xmath65 mhz , average qubit excitation gaps @xmath66 ghz with normal distribution and dispersion @xmath67 , effective qubit - cavity coupling @xmath68 mhz with small dispersion @xmath69 and @xmath70 qubits in the ensemble .",
    "these parameters give best fit in the experimental regime at small @xmath1 discussed in the next section [ exp_res ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows plots of the phase shift dependence on magnetic flux for @xmath71 qubits in the system and fixed spread @xmath67 of the normal distribution of @xmath27 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath72 the phase shift fluctuates and depends on a particular realization of the qubit frequencies , while for @xmath73 it appears rather smooth and regular , meaning that the array of qubits can be treated as a continuous system at these parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show results for different values of disorder with the following dispersions @xmath74 , keeping qubit number @xmath75 fixed .",
    "one can see from the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that , with increasing disorder , the phase shift pictures start to reveal fluctuations . for the realistic spread @xmath76",
    "the system remains far from the ensemble limit , even for this relatively large number of qubits .",

    "the resonator frequency @xmath63 ghz and persistent current @xmath64 na are fixed . in our numerical method , we assume a normal distribution of the qubit excitation gaps and effective coupling .",
    "we selected a parameter distribution with dispersions @xmath67 and @xmath69 for a system containing @xmath70 qubits with an average excitation gap @xmath66 ghz , which closely resembles the experimental data .",
    "subsequently , we fitted the decoherence rate and effective qubit coupling and found @xmath65 mhz and @xmath79 mhz , respectively . while the assumed spread is less than the experimentally expected one ( @xmath80 ) all found parameters are in correspondence with those quoted in @xcite , where @xmath81 ghz , @xmath82 mhz , @xmath83 mhz and @xmath84 . the values for qubit number and dephasing reported in ref .",
    "@xcite were found under the assumption of identical qubits .",
    "here we show , that the experimental data can be reproduced fairly well under the assumption of randomly distributed qubit parameters . in the experiment",
    "it was observed , that an ensemble of @xmath84 qubits , resonantly interacting with the cavity mode and monitored over long time , spontaneously dissolved into two sub - ensembles of @xmath85 qubits each , resulting into two jumps in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left panel ) . in our exact diagonalization procedure we do not find the formation of sub - ensembles but arrive at correspondence with the experimental curves if parameters of the metamaterial and disorder are close to the experimental values .",
