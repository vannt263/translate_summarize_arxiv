    "cryogenic gravitational wave ( gw ) antennas entered into long term data taking operation in 1990 ( explorer  @xcite ) , in 1991 ( allegro  @xcite ) , in 1993 ( niobe  @xcite ) , in 1994 ( nautilus  @xcite ) and in 1997 ( auriga  @xcite ) , with gradual performance improvements over the years .",
    "analysis of the data taken in coincidence among all cryogenic resonant detectors in operation during the years 1997 and 1998 was performed  @xcite .",
    "no coincidence excess was found above background using the event lists produced under the protocol of the international gravitational event collaboration ( igec ) , among the groups allegro , auriga , explorer / nautilus and niobe .",
    "later @xcite , a coincidence search between the data of explorer and nautilus was carried out by introducing in the data analysis considerations based on physical characteristics of the detectors : the event energy and the directionality .",
    "the result was a small coincidence excess when the detectors were favorably oriented with respect to the galactic centre .",
    "here we extend our analysis to new data obtained in the year 2001 , when both explorer and nautilus were operating at their best sensitivity , using the same procedures applied for the previous analysis @xcite . as previously done in ref .",
    "@xcite we shall sometimes use the word @xmath0 , although we are well aware that its significance might be jeopardized by any possible data selection . with this @xmath1",
    "we shall use probability estimations in comparing different experimental conditions .",
    "the resonant mass gw detectors nautilus , operating at the infn frascati laboratory , and explorer , operating at cern , both consist of an aluminium 2270 kg bar cooled to very low temperatures .",
    "a resonant transducer converts the mechanical oscillations into an electrical signal and is followed by a dcsquid electronic amplifier .",
    "the bar and the resonant transducer form a coupled oscillator system with two resonant modes .    with respect to the year 1998",
    "the following changes were made in the set up of the detectors : the nautilus detector operated at a thermodynamic temperature of 1.5 k instead of 0.14 k ; the explorer detector was equipped with a new transducer providing a larger bandwidth and consequently enhanced sensitivity .",
    "the characteristics of the two detectors are given in the table [ dire ] .    0.1 in    .",
    "main characteristics of the two detectors in the year 2001 .",
    "the axes of the two detectors are aligned to within a few degrees of one other , the chance of coincidence detection thus being maximized .",
    "the pulse sensitivity for both detectors is of the order of @xmath2 for 1 ms bursts . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ coinci ]    we have verified that , using the cosmic ray detector of nautilus , these events are not due to cosmic ray showers .",
    "the analysis presented here differs slightly ( eg . for the use of the sidereal time ) from that",
    "applied previously @xcite .",
    "we therefore present the 1998 data also in terms of the sidereal time .",
    "we must consider that the 1998 data are noisier than the 2001 data .",
    "in particular the explorer data have a noise @xmath3 ten times larger than that of the 2001 data , whilst the nautilus noise was of the same order .    for the coincidence search we change the window from @xmath4 ( the igec choice at that time ) used in the paper @xcite to the present @xmath5 used here .",
    "the result is given in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "an effect similar to the one found for the 2001 data is noticed , although weaker than that obtained with the less noisy 2001 data .",
    "in any data analysis care must be taken to avoid choosing procedures which favour particular results .",
    "thus we considered the possibility that our result be biased , although involuntarily , by any such choices . in the present analysis all choices were made `` a priori '' and already published in the scientific literature ; in particular the igec choice for the coincidence window of @xmath6 , the energy filter ( see ref . @xcite and @xcite ) and the threshold for definition of an event ( see ref.@xcite ) .    nevertheless , we tested whether our present choices were indeed , to accident , most apt to produce the coincidence excess .",
    "this proved not to be the case .    to find the @xmath7 parameters , that is the threshold and the energy filter parameter , we considered only the coincidences in the sidereal hour interval 3 to 5 and minimized the probability of a coincidence excess by chance .",
    "we found that the most favorable threshold for the definition of event is at @xmath8 , instead of @xmath9 .",
    "the most favorable parameter for the energy filter is 50% , instead of 68% .",
    "we thought it interesting to report the result for these most favorable choices , @xmath8 for the threshold and 50% for the energy filter .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig12 ] .",
    "we notice an indication that the coincidence excess might extend to the sidereal hour interval 3 to 6 , including two more coincidences in the period 5 to 6 sidereal hours ( see also fig.[fig10 ] ) .",
    "we want to remark that this hour was not included in the optimization process .",
    "as far as the coincidence window is concerned , we found ( @xmath10 ) that the best choice for having a coincidence excess in the 3 to 5 sidereal hour interval is @xmath11 , and any coincidence window from @xmath12 to @xmath13 gives comparable results .",
    "the igec search for coincidences @xcite was performed without applying the event energy algorithms based on the event amplitude and on the directional properties of the detectors ; it gave a no coincidence excess .",
    "with new data taken in the year 2001 and with improved sensitivity we repeated the coincidence search with the detectors explorer and nautilus ( no other detector was in operation during the year 2001 ) , applying data analysis algorithms based on known physical characteristics of the detectors , namely energy of the events and directionality of the detectors .",
    "we obtained a coincidence excess at sidereal hours between 3 and 5 .    at a given sidereal time",
    "the intersection of the celestial sphere with the plane perpendicular to the detector axis is a circle .",
    "we show in fig.[striscia - ora ] two of these circles ( i.e. , at 1 and at 13 sidereal hours ) in the right ascension - declination plane . in the representation of fig.[striscia - ora ] the line which indicates the point sources perpendicular to the detector axis ( we call this @xmath14 ) moves to the right with sidereal time .",
    "this line intersects the location of the galactic centre twice a day ( at 4.3 and at 13.6 sidereal hours ) . only once per day",
    "( at 4.3 sidereal hour ) this line overlaps with the entire galactic disk .",
    "the overlapping takes place because of the particular orientation of the detectors on the earth surface ( see table [ dire ] ) , and would not occur for a different azimuth angle of detector orientation .",
    "if all gw sources were concentrated in the galactic centre we would have found a coincidence excess twice a day .",
    "the coincidence excess occurs only once per day , just when the line of maximum sensitivity of the detectors overlaps with the galactic disk , as if gw sources were distributed in the galactic disk and not just located in its center .    as for the energy balance , in the year 2001 we find in the interval from 3 to 5 sidereal hour a coincidence excess of , very roughly , @xmath15 coincidences occurring in five days ( two sidereal hours out of twentyfour , in a total time period of 1490 hours @xmath1660 days ) . in terms of energy conversion into",
    "gw we have , very roughly , about one coincidence per day with a signal energy of about 100 mk .",
    "this corresponds , using the classical cross - section , to a conventional burst with amplitude @xmath17 and to the isotropic conversion into gw energy of 0.004 solar masses , with sources located at distance of 8 kpc .",
    "the observed rate is much larger than the models today available predict , for galactic sources .",
    "we note , however , that our rate of events is within the upper limit determined by igec @xcite for short gw bursts and by the 40m - ligo prototype interferometer @xcite for coalescing binary sources in the galaxy .",
    "we think it is unlikely that the observed coincidence excess be due to noise fluctuations , but we prefer to take a conservative position and wait for a stronger confirmation of our result , before reaching any definite conclusion and claim that gravitational waves have been observed .",
    "furthermore , although we have excluded that the events are due to cosmic ray showers ( see section 6 ) , we can not completely rule out that they be due to some other exotic , still unknown , phenomenon .",
    "a possible way to distinguish gw from other causes is to measure other vibrational modes of the detectors and verify that , as predicted by general relativity , only quadrupole modes are excited .",
    "this requires multimode detection ( with bars or spheres ) and to improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the apparatuses .",
    "we expect to collect new data with explorer and nautilus with improved sensitivity .",
    "we plan to repeat the same analysis with these new data and also with any other new data provided by other gw groups , those which operate the resonant detectors and those which operate or are beginning to operate the interferometric detectors geo , ligo , tama and virgo .",
    "we are indebted to professor ugo amaldi for very useful discussions and suggestions .",
