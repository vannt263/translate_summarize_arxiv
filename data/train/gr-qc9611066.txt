    "in a recent paper by bonnor @xcite , the equilibrium conditions for a charged test particle in the field of a spherically symmetric charged mass ( reissner - nordstrm solution ) were investigated .",

    "a balance solution was originally thought to have been found @xcite within the herlt class for both sources having @xmath4 , but it was subsequently shown that the intervening line singularity could not be removed @xcite .",

    "he found that condition ( [ classical ] ) holds for electrostatic balance .",
    "however he stated that his solution can not be interpreted as the non - linear superposition of two reissner - nordstrm solutions and thus the masses are not spherically symmetric .    in the present paper , an exact electrostatic solution of the einstein - maxwell equations representing the exterior field of two",

    "thus , apart from one special case , neither the paper  i nor the paper  ii parameterizations can be interpreted in as the invariant physical parameters .",
    "the only exception is for identical bodies ( with or without a line singularity ) in the parameterization of paper  i. in this very special case of the weyl - class , the parameters @xmath112 are the physical masses and charges .",

    "the separation dependence of cases 47 can not be studied in the exact solution using the present methods for the same reasons cases 23 can not be studied .",
    "since the separation dependence can not be tested using the present methods , there is little value in numerically calculating the proper separation of the sources in cases a  c .    the physical parameters in case c could approximate a test body in a strong gravitational field . using these values in case 7 and transforming from spherical coordinates to cylindrical coordinates for a single reissner - nordstrm body using the transformation ( with @xmath208 )",
    "@xmath209 bonnor s method yields a coordinate separation of @xmath210 . since the separation of the bodies from these two methods",
    "are not consistent , it would appear that case c does not sufficiently approximate a test body .",
    "the essential departure in the present paper from previous work is the attempt to parameterize the solution in terms of true physical constants of the space - time . for a static axially symmetric solution of the einstein - maxwell equations , the integrals of eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and ( [ charge ] ) provide the invariant parameters required for meaningful analysis of the properties of the solution .",
    "there are three cases of the exact solution which have not been examined .",
    "they are an extreme body with respectively a reissner - nordstrm black hole , a superextreme body , and another extreme body for which the solution is not of the weyl - class .",
    "knowledge of the solution analytically in terms of the physical parameters is required to analyze these cases adequately .",
    "ref .   defines the terms `` undercharged '' , `` overcharged '' and `` critically charged '' as follows ( @xmath86 ) : @xmath211 for the weyl - class , the `` lengths '' of the weyl rods are @xcite @xmath212 .",
    "if body 1 is `` critically charged ''",
    "@xcite , then @xmath213 since @xmath214 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the terminology `` critically charged '' body and `` extreme '' body may be used interchangeably for weyl - class solutions . if body 1 is `` undercharged '' , @xmath215 and @xmath216 are real quantities .",
    "thus `` undercharged body '' and `` black hole '' are synonymous terms in the weyl - class .",
    "finally , if body 1 is `` overcharged '' , @xmath217 and @xmath218 are complex conjugates .",
    "thus the terms `` overcharged '' and `` superextreme '' are equivalent descriptions in the weyl - class . unlike the weyl - class solutions where the `` lengths '' of the weyl rods ( real or complex ) depend only upon the mass and charge of that source , it is strongly suggested from the analysis of section  [ equilibsec ] that for the general ( non - weyl - class ) solution , the `` lengths '' of the rods also depend on the mass and charge of the other source and the distance separating the bodies as well .",
    "it would thus be possible to have a `` critically '' charged body ( according to eq .",
    "( [ criticaldiscussion ] ) ) for which the `` rod '' is either of non - zero `` length '' or `` complex '' .",
    "this is important in terms of nomenclature for describing the physics of the space - time .",
    "since the transition of a pair ( eg .  ( @xmath219 ) ) from real values to a complex conjugate pair in sibgatullin s @xcite method defines a differentiation of an object with a horizon to one without , it would seem that the appropriate description would be respectively , a black hole ( horizon ) , `` extreme '' body ( zero `` length '' weyl rod ) and `` superextreme '' body ( no horizon or naked singularity ) as described in paper  i. the descriptions `` under '' , `` over '' and `` critically '' charged body should be reserved for the relations @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 respectively between the individual masses and charges .",
    "this classification scheme would describe equilibrium conditions more precisely once all are identified .",
    "the appropriateness of such a scheme would become apparent when the analytic physical parameterization of the solution is known .",
    "bonnor s @xcite test particle analysis has been modified @xcite in such a way that the equilibrium conditions of a charged test particle in the field of a kerr - newman source can be studied .",
    "the generalization of the mathematical solution to two spinning sources ( kerr - newman sources ) is already known @xcite .",
    "one is able to invariantly define angular momentum for a stationary space - time in a manner similar to eqs .",
    "( [ mass][charge ] ) because of the presence of a spacelike killing vector ( rotational symmetry ) ( see ref .",
    "and references therein for definitions of mass and angular momentum of stationary vacuum fields ) .",
    "it is unknown how the subsequent analysis of two identical spinning bodies in paper  i based on the invariant definitions will affect their results , if at all .",
    "however , it is clear that the parameterization given is inadequate for the physical analysis of the general case ( non - identical bodies ) .",
    "the solution derived in papers i , ii and this paper is a generalization of the weyl - class double reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "however , the analytic parameterizations presented in papers i , ii and this paper can not in all cases be interpreted as the true physical constants of the spacetime . the invariant physical charge for each source",

    "numerical methods were used to evaluate the invariant individual masses and charges for the axially symmetric superposition of two reissner - nordstrm bodies .",
    "it was found that neither the newtonian balance condition nor critically charged bodies are necessary for electrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the dependence of the balance condition on the separation of the bodies is not yet known due to the complexities involved in expressing the solution analytically in terms of the true physical set of parameters",
