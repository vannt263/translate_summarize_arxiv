    "the low - mass slope is taken to be unity .    as can be seen in figure [ mainplot ]",
    ", adopting this star - forming sequence effectively removes the rapid growth of low - mass galaxies .",
    "this is due to a steeper low - mass slope , which in turns implies longer mass - doubling timescales ( @xmath92 ) for low - mass galaxies .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ tdouble ] , which shows the mass - doubling timescale at @xmath11 as a function of low - mass slope in equation [ bpl_eqn ] . extrapolating the observed high - mass slope of 0.44 at @xmath11 to low masses results in a doubling time of less than 10 million years for a galaxy of mass @xmath83 = 7 , compared to @xmath93 myr for a slope of unity .",

    "this model has four parameters : the transition mass @xmath98 , the high - mass slope @xmath99 , the low - mass slope @xmath100 , and the normalization @xmath101 .",
    "as the model is not very sensitive to the location of the transition mass , we fix @xmath102 in all fits .",
    "this lack of sensitivity comes from the fact that , in reality , the slope changes smoothly with mass in the transition region .",
    "however , lacking the theoretical basis for a more physically motivated functional form , we prefer a double power law for simplicity .",
    "the best - fit redshift evolution of these parameters is shown in figure [ parms ] .",
    "in general , at higher redshifts , the mass function prefers a steep low - mass slope and a shallow high - mass slope . at low redshifts , the high - mass and low - mass slopes head towards convergence",

    "is overpredicted by @xmath105 dex .",
    "these low - mass galaxies were below the mass - complete limit at the start of the simulation , and so both their original number densities and their expected growth rates came from fits to galaxies at higher masses , extrapolated to low mass . thus , their low - redshift number densities are not expected to match the observed number densities exactly .",
    "the other noticeable difference is around the transition mass of @xmath106 , where the number density is under - predicted below and over - predicted above by @xmath107 dex .",
    "this is a natural result of fitting a bimodal double - power law to an intrinsically curved distribution of star formation rates : the star formation rates directly below the transition mass are slightly over - predicted , and the star formation rates directly above the transition mass are slightly under - predicted .",
    "a more physically motivated functional form will resolve these differences in the future .",
    "below @xmath108 , the high - mass slope becomes considerably steeper than the low - mass slope .",
    "this is a direct result of the number density of high - mass galaxies increasing substantially at low redshift , an increase which is both intrinsic to the zfourge mass functions and also arises naturally when zfourge is combined with the sdss-@xmath26 mass functions .",
    "we caution that while our model interprets this as an increase in the star formation rate of star - forming massive galaxies at low redshift , this is not seen in observations ( e.g. , noeske et  al .",
    "an alternate explanation is that mergers , both major and minor , are important in the evolution of massive galaxies and correspondingly in the evolution of the mass function at the high - mass end ( van dokkum 2005 ; bezanson et  al .",

    "the equation is identical to the continuity equation in stellar dynamics ( e.g. binney & tremaine ( 2008 ) , equation 4.204 ) . in this case , the mass @xmath151 is the x - position , and the star formation rate is the velocity .",
    "as further discussed by franx et al ( in preparation ) , the consequence is that the evolution of the mass function due to star formation at any @xmath151 is determined by @xmath150 only , and is the same for all models with a given @xmath152 and @xmath150 .",
    "hence the scatter in the star formation at a given @xmath151 does not influence the evolution of the mass function - as long as @xmath150 is given .",
    "it is not important on what timescale galaxies may move below or above the average .",
    "as shown by franx et al ( in preparation ) , another way to see this quickly is by assuming that scatter is caused by two populations of galaxies with two different star formation rates . in appendix b , we show that sum of the two populations will satisfy the continuity equation , just like the two populations separately .",
    "this argument can be extended to an arbitrary number of subpopulations .",
    "thus , any galaxy population for which the mean star formation rate as a function of mass is identical will evolve in the same fashion .",
    "the actual distribution of star formation rates does not affect the evolution of the stellar mass function : as long as the mean star formation rate as a function of mass is identical in any given distribution at _ every time step _ , the mass function will evolve in an identical fashion .",
    "we adopt an instantaneous stellar mass loss model . in reality",
    ", the mass loss rate of galaxies is time - dependent , with the majority of it occurring in the first hundred million years .",
    "the efficiency of the instantaneous approximation will thus scale inversely with the specific star formation rate of galaxies , meaning that low - mass galaxies at high redshift are most affected by this approximation .",
    "stellar mass functions are tabulated using the current mass in stars and stellar remnants , thus implicitly taking this effect into account . to account for this in our model ,",
    "the fraction of mass returned to the ism , @xmath62 , would have to be modeled as sfh - dependent .",
    "this would likely elevate the implied star formation rates at low masses by @xmath153 .",
    "this is not a dominant effect , but would contribute towards reconciling stellar mass growth and star formation rates at high redshift and low masses .",

    "we find that a simple extrapolation of the observed slope to low stellar masses is inconsistent with the observed evolution of the mass function .",
    "we conclude from this comparison that one or all of the following must be true : ( 1 ) the star - forming sequence steepens at low masses , ( 2 ) the destruction rate of low - mass galaxies by mergers is very high , ( 3 ) there is a dominant population of low - mass quiescent galaxies missing from high - redshift surveys .",
    "we use merger rates from semi - analytical models to show that the merger rate of low - mass galaxies is several orders of magnitude too low to solve the issue .",
    "we also show that there would have to be several orders of magnitude more quiescent galaxies than observed at @xmath11 to solve the issue , which is unlikely to be true in the mass - complete regime of stellar mass surveys .",
    "we thus conclude that , in order to decrease the star formation rates for galaxies with mass @xmath154 m@xmath33 , the star - forming sequence must steepen at low masses .",

    "note that it is not a functional fit that is shown ( as is true for the star formation rates derived from the mass function without mergers ) , but the actual inferred star formation rates .",
    "including the mergers when fitting for the star - forming sequence slightly increases the star formation rates at low masses , while decreasing them substantially at high masses .",
    "this is due to the fact that the main effect of mergers at low mass is the destruction of galaxies , while the main effect of mergers at high mass is additional mass growth .",
    "in fact , applying the guo et  al .",
    "( 2013b ) sam merger growth rates to the high - mass end is more than sufficient to model the growth of high - mass galaxies in the zfourge mass function : presumably , the merger growth rates in the real universe are lower than those measured from the sam .",
    "we also fit the merger - modulated star formation rates with a double power law with the same form as equation [ brokenpowerlaw ] .",
    "the redshift evolution of the normalization and the slopes is shown in figure [ bpl_append ] .",
    "crucially , the evidence for a mass - dependent slope is not altered by including the growth rate due to mergers .",
    "in fact , this conclusion is strengthened , though this highlights an important point : deriving the high - mass slope of the star - forming sequence is very sensitive to the merger rate ( conversely , the low - mass slope is very stable to the merger rate ) .    however , using merger growth rates measured directly from the sam violates mass conservation . specifically , the guo et  al .",
    "( 2013b ) mass functions have a higher number density of low - mass galaxies than is observed in zfourge , which means that for the same rate of destruction of galaxies , the merger growth rates from the semi - analytical model will be higher than the simple 1:10 merger growth rates assumed in our model .",
    "this results in mass growth at the high - mass end which is more than enough to explain the growth of the mass function .",
    "this extra growth is reflected in the high - mass drop off in the merger - modulated star formation rates from the stellar mass functions , visible in figure [ mainplotappend ] .",
    "in this section , we prove that equation [ galaxycont ] presented in the text is linear , and thus can be generalized to the entire galaxy population .",
