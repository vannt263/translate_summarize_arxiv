    "the concept of dissipative solitons , being localized , dynamical objects with non - trivial internal energy flows , which may exist in open , nonlinear systems due to balance between gain , loss , dispersion / diffraction and nonlinearity , is by now established in many branches of physics @xcite , and in particular in optics where many applications have been devised @xcite .",
    "although originally conceived for spatially continuous systems , they have lattice counterparts as discrete dissipative solitons / breathers , which also have been discussed in a large number of physical contexts ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) .    in order to provide a feasible mechanism for transport of localized quantities of energy ,",
    "mobile dissipative solitons are highly important objects .",
    "while their existence as exponentially localized modes for continuous systems is well - known and not surprising ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the issue is more delicate for lattices where , for the corresponding conservative systems , the lattice can be viewed as inducing a periodic peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential , which must be overcome during the motion . as a consequence , in a generic conservative lattice system moving localized modes",
    "are not expected to exist as exact solutions , since their motion in the pn potential causes radiation to be emitted and thereby decay of a single moving soliton / breather ( see , e.g. , @xcite for discussion and further references , and @xcite for a mathematical treatment ) . however , in a dissipative environment with energy input , one might hope that a balance ( at least in average ) between gain and loss could still be established to sustain a moving discrete soliton indefinitely , and at the same time damp out its radiation into a tail exponentially decaying to zero .    in fact , scenarios similar to that outlined above have already been observed in several contexts , theoretically / numerically as well as experimentally .",
    "probably the first thorough numerical studies of mobile discrete breathers in dissipative lattices were reported in a series of papers by the zaragoza group @xcite , for the damped and ac - driven discrete sine - gordon ( frenkel - kontorova ) model .",
    "they were found to appear as dynamical attractors for a rather large range of parameters , with phonon tails exponentially decaying due to the damping , and asymmetric due to doppler shifts of radiation emitted in forward and backward directions .",
    "two different types of moving breathers , with a small regime of bistability , were discussed in @xcite : `` induced fast '' breathers , generated from superthreshold , symmetry - breaking dynamical perturbations of stable , pinned breathers , and `` spontaneous slow '' breathers appearing from depinning parametric instabilities of pinned , quasiperiodic breathers . an intermediate regime with breathers moving in a seemingly random , diffusive way was also identified .",
    "other properties of moving breathers described were the possibility for formation of bound states , and regimes of mode locking of the breather velocity at rational multiples of the driving frequency .",
    "however , one should note that due to the spatially homogeneous driving force , the oscillation amplitude of the breather tails does not decay to zero but to some constant value , and thus for an infinite system all those excitations would have an infinite energy .    in optics , discrete dissipative solitons are probably most commonly discussed for arrays of coupled - waveguide resonators , `` discrete cavity solitons '' ( dcss ) @xcite , for which the standard coupled - mode equations , in the case of kerr nonlinearity , share many basic features with the small - oscillation limit of the damped - driven frenkel - kontorova model . in @xcite",
    "it was found that resting dcss could be made mobile by imposing a symmetry - breaking perturbation on the system by inclining the holding beam , thereby introducing a phase gradient for the effective driving force .",
    "further numerical analysis for a similar system with saturable nonlinearity @xcite also reached the conclusion that , generally , a sufficiently large symmetry - breaking was needed for a stable stationary soliton to move .",
    "this scenario should be analogous to that of the `` induced fast '' breathers of @xcite , except that the symmetry breaking perturbation is applied to the physical system rather than to the initial condition .",
    "a more recent work @xcite also identifies `` spontaneously walking '' , as well as uniformly moving , dcss in the absence of external symmetry breaking , in regimes of hopf instability of stationary dcss .",
    "these are thus analogous to the diffusively moving and `` spontaneous slow '' breathers , respectively , of @xcite .    experimentally , moving discrete dissipative breathers",
    "have been observed in damped - driven electrical lattices , one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite as well as more recently two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite . in the 1d lattice in @xcite",
    ", traveling breathers locked to a uniform driver were found as generic nonlinear excitations in certain parameter regimes , with velocities precisely tunable by the driver amplitude and frequency .",
    "the mechanism for mobility was explained in @xcite in terms of a self - induced dc - distortion `` propelling '' the breather . in 2d @xcite ,",
    "an erratic motion was found , comparable to that from @xcite discussed above .",
    "however , in all above discussed cases , the moving discrete dissipative solitons / breathers were supported by uniform external driving , leading necessarily to modes with non - zero tails and infinite energy . by contrast , in this work we address the question whether moving nonlinear localized lattice modes may be supported solely by an intrinsic gain mechanism , thereby allowing for finite - energy solutions with tails decaying to zero .",
    "although the question is of generic nature , we will address it here in the context of a generalized discrete ginzburg - landau type model , introduced by rozanov s group @xcite to describe the propagation of monochromatic radiation in a system of weakly coupled single - mode active optical fibers , characterized by saturable amplification and absorption @xcite and a kerr nonlinear refractive index .",
    "the properties of stationary , strongly localized discrete solitons in this system were studied in @xcite , generalizing earlier results obtained in a cubic - quintic approximation @xcite . indeed , also moving solitons were reported for this system in @xcite , but only for a special case with zero kerr nonlinearity , and with broad , continuum - like shapes .",
    "by contrast , here we will mainly focus on showing that also strongly localized moving solitons exist in presence of a standard , on - site kerr nonlinearity , and illustrate the mechanisms by which the interplay by gain and damping makes it possible to overcome the peierls - nabarro barrier of the corresponding conservative system , through self - induced time - periodic oscillations .",
    "it should be noted that similar self - induced oscillations of a moving soliton were recently also noticed @xcite in the transient dynamics for a continuous model with linear gain and nonlinear loss and a spatially periodic modulation of the linear as well as the kerr nonlinear refractive index ; however , due to the linear gain the background of these solutions were unstable and therefore they were not dynamical attractors .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the generalized discrete ginzburg - landau model of @xcite , which we also extend with possible inter - site kerr - nonlinearities and on - site disorder .",

    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the model to be used in this paper is a generalization of the model from @xcite , which we take in the following form : @xmath0 here , the dot will be referred to as a time - derivative , although evidently it should be interpreted as a derivative with respect to a longitudinal coordinate @xmath1 for the physical system of coupled identical fibers in @xcite , describing discrete spatial optical solitons . in this model",
    ", @xmath2 is the mode amplitude in the @xmath3th fiber , and @xmath4 is the coupling constant between neighboring fibers , which we here take to be real and thus neglecting losses in the medium between the fibers ( in @xcite , possible absorption or gain in this medium was also considered by adding a small imaginary part to @xmath4 ) .",
    "we have also included a linear , real on - site potential @xmath5 to allow for possible disorder in the fiber properties ( although we will take @xmath6 for most of the paper ) .",
    "the real function @xmath7 describes the amplification and absorption characteristics of each fiber , and is taken as in @xcite to have the form @xmath8 here , @xmath9 describes the linear , non - resonant losses , @xmath10 and @xmath11 the strength of the saturable gain and absorption , respectively , and @xmath12 the ratio between the gain and absorption saturation intensities .",
    "we have chosen to normalize the field according to the gain saturation intensity and without loss of generality assumed that the kerr coefficient is equal to unity . a related model with purely linear losses ( @xmath13 ) was also studied in @xcite in the context of dcss ( i.e. , with an additional constant term in the right - hand side describing the amplitude of a holding beam ) , where also real - world parameter estimates for coupled gaas semiconductor waveguide resonators were given .",
    "in addition , we have augmented eq .",
    "( [ master - eq ] ) with a term describing a possible inter - site kerr nonlinear refractive index with a strength @xmath14 , of the form @xmath15 the form of this term follows from coupled - mode analysis of a waveguide array embedded in a nonlinear kerr medium @xcite ; for simplicity we consider here a special case of the two - parameter form derived in @xcite by equating the parameters to the single parameter @xmath14 . as shown in @xcite , the conservative version of eq .",
    "( [ master - eq ] ) ( @xmath16 ) also appears as a rotating - wave type approximation of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled with anharmonic inter - site potentials , with @xmath17 corresponding to pure on - site ( klein - gordon chain ) and @xmath18 to pure inter - site ( fermi - pasta - ulam chain ) anharmonicity .",
    "the reason for incorporating @xmath19 into our model is , that this type of inter - site nonlinearity may drastically reduce the peierls - nabarro potential for the conservative model ( in the two - parameter model it may even be strictly zero at special parameter values @xcite ) , and therefore highly facilitate the movement of even strongly localized solutions @xcite . as we will see later , the term @xmath19 is not necessary for finding strongly localized moving solutions as dynamical attractors to eq .",
    "( [ master - eq ] ) ( and indeed we will put @xmath17 for the main part of this paper ) ; however a nonzero @xmath14 increases considerably their existence region and also allows for a richer dynamical scenario .    in the conservative case @xmath16 , the two conserved quantities of eq .",
    "( [ master - eq ] ) are the total power ( norm ) , @xmath20 and the total energy ( hamiltonian ) @xcite , which for the general case with nonzero @xmath5 and @xmath14 can be expressed most conveniently on the form",

    ", one imagines a localized mode sliding with small velocity across the lattice , and the pn barrier is then defined as the difference in @xmath23 , at fixed @xmath24 , between the two stationary modes centered at , respectively in - between , lattice sites . in typical situations ,",
    "one of these modes is stable and the other unstable , and therefore they usually correspond to min and max , respectively , of an imagined pn potential .",
    "however , in some models ( and notably the model ( [ master - eq ] ) with nonzero @xmath14 @xcite ) , these two modes exchange stability through symmetry - breaking bifurcations under parameter variation , and there exists a small parameter regime of existence of additional , symmetry - broken , stationary solutions @xcite which also must be taken into account when determining the `` true '' pn - barrier .    as explained in @xcite , a necessary ( but by no means sufficient ) condition to have nontrivial localized solutions for the fully dissipative model ( [ master - eq ] ) can be obtained as a restriction of the gain parameter to an interval , @xmath25 the upper limit follows from the condition of existence of a stable zero - amplitude tail , and the lower limit from the condition of existence of a solution with non - zero amplitude for which the dissipative function @xmath26 in ( [ fd ] ) is not always negative .",
    "notice also that the condition to have a nonvanishing interval in ( [ ginterval ] ) imposes an additional restriction on the damping parameters @xmath27 , which can be expressed as @xmath28 let us finally in this section also remark , that expanding the dissipative function in ( [ fd ] ) for small @xmath29 yields ( in a cubic - quintic approximation for @xmath30 such as in @xcite ) @xmath31 however , as we will see , the relevant solutions describing moving localized modes are typically found with peak values of the order of unity or larger , and thus result essentially from the strong saturabilities of the gain and damping parts of the dissipative function on different intensity scales , and can not be described by the cubic - quintic approximation ( [ 3 - 5 ] ) .",
    "in order to systemize and get out the most essential features of the moving localized solutions found in certain regimes of parameter space , we will from now on fix the damping parameters in ( [ fd ] ) to have the same values as those used for the study of stationary localized modes in @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) , namely @xmath32 numerically , the largest possible existence regime ( [ ginterval ] ) then becomes @xmath33 .",
    "notably , the large value of @xmath12 implies that the absorption saturates at a much lower intensity than the gain .",
    "we have checked that these parameter values are not exceptional , e.g. , by varying @xmath9 up to 1.5 , @xmath11 down to 0.5 , and @xmath12 up to 20 . although evidently quantitative features change , the qualitative picture remains similar as long as the possible existence regime determined by ( [ ginterval])-([dampcond ] ) remains non - negligible . unless otherwise noted we will assume @xmath6 . we first ( sec .",
    "[ sec : q0 ] ) describe the scenario observed for pure on - site nonlinearity ( @xmath17 ) when varying the gain amplitude @xmath10 and coupling constant @xmath4 , and then ( sec .",
    "[ sec : qne0 ] ) discuss additional features appearing in the presence of inter - site nonlinearities ( @xmath34 ) .    in order to seed a moving localized solution ,",
    "an initial gaussian pulse with an imposed phase - gradient was used as a trial solution . by properly adjusting parameters ,",
    "such pulses were found by direct time - integration of the equations of motion to belong to the basin of attraction of exact moving localized solutions with specific velocities @xmath35 . once found , these solutions were used as new initial conditions in continuation versus the parameters @xmath36 .",
    "( in practice , since the existence regime of moving solutions is larger in presence of inter - site nonlinearities , it turned out to be easier to first find moving solutions for some nonzero @xmath14 , which then could be continued back to the , possibly more physically interesting , case @xmath17 . )",
    "the velocities were determined directly as @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the translation of the soliton peak during a ( large ) time @xmath39 , disregarding the initial transient before reaching the attracting state . as we will see below",
    ", a moving soliton generally exhibits an internal oscillation frequency of its intensity @xmath40 , yielding oscillations also in the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath23 , thereby allowing the pn - barrier of the corresponding conservative system to be overcome . assuming a single internal frequency @xmath41 , a moving soliton can be assumed to have a form analogous to a moving discrete breather as defined in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being a function which is @xmath44-periodic with respect to its first argument and localized with respect to the second .",
    "if , for some integers @xmath45 , the internal frequency and the velocity are related by a commensurability relation , @xmath46 the solution will return to its initial shape after a time @xmath47 , translated @xmath48 sites . as we discuss below , in the case",
    "@xmath17 with pure on - site nonlinearity , apparently the pinning potential is strong enough to always force such a commensurability ( in most cases with @xmath49 ) . on the other hand , for nonzero @xmath14 the weakening of the pn potential also allows for incommensurate regimes ( @xmath50 ) , where the solution ,",

    "the oscillations and the velocity are 1:1-locked [ @xmath65 ] for @xmath116 , where a hopf - type bifurcation appears and the oscillations develop an additional modulation frequency , incommensurate with the translational dynamics as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : qp ] .    the quasiperiodically moving slow soliton can be found for @xmath117 ( note that this corresponds roughly to the regime where the pn - potential of the corresponding conservative system is expected to be weakest as discussed above ) .",
    "however , as the modulation frequency varies ( generally increases as @xmath14 decreases in this interval ) , we also find small intervals of nontrivially phase locked states , where the two fundamental frequencies lock to rational values ( i.e. , analogous to arnold tongues ) . as an example",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2:5 ] the 2:5-locked state [ @xmath107 ] which is a stable attractor for @xmath119 with other parameters as above .",
    "decreasing @xmath14 further leads to a larger interval of @xmath120 locking , @xmath121 , which for a further decrease undergoes a sequence of period - doubling bifurcations leading to a chaotically moving solution for @xmath122 , similarly as described above for @xmath17 .",
    "finally , at @xmath123 it gets trapped into a mode oscillating around a fixed site , similarly as described in @xcite .     in a lattice with uniform disorder of strength @xmath124 , for @xmath125 and other parameters same as in fig .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]      finally , we illustrate that the existence of moving lattice solitons is not crucially dependent on having a perfect lattice , but also survive in presence of weak disorder .",
    "generally , disordered photonic structures are of large current interest , e.g. in the contexts of random lasers and anderson localization of light ; see , e.g. , recent reviews @xcite . here , we choose the on - site potential @xmath5 in ( [ master - eq ] ) to have a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath127 $ ] , and launch initially a soliton found as an attractor in the regular lattice .",
    "if the disorder is sufficiently weak , the soliton settles into a new attracting moving mode after a short transient , as illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : dis ] , which for @xmath126 belong to the branch of fast solitons for @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig : q0vel ] , a moving attracting state appears for @xmath128 , while the soliton generally gets trapped for a slightly stronger disorder . the velocity of the soliton in the disordered lattice in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis ] is only slightly smaller than for the corresponding parameter values in the regular lattice ( @xmath129 compared to @xmath130 ) . from the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : dis ] , we see apparently irregular oscillations of power and hamiltonian , compensating for the irregularities in the disordered lattice so that the moving soliton still can travel with a constant velocity . note from fig .",
    "[ fig : dis ] that the oscillation patterns exactly repeat themselves after one round - trip in the periodic lattice .",
    "thus , even in a disordered lattice the soliton may at each point adjust its internal parameters according to its local environment , in order to travel with constant velocity .    as could be expected",
    ", the critical disorder below which a traveling mode can be sustained is generally considerably smaller for the slow , large - amplitude oscillation modes .",
    "for example , with the parameter values of fig .",
    "[ fig : q0vel ] , we found that the moving solution with @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tails ] keeps traveling with constant velocity for many round trips in the lattice when @xmath131 , but gets trapped for slightly larger disorder .",
    "also in this case the velocity gets slightly smaller in presence of disorder ( @xmath132 compared to @xmath133 for the above parameter values ) .",
    "in conclusion , we showed that exact traveling , exponentially localized , discrete solitons exist as stable dynamical attractors in a model for active waveguide arrays with kerr nonlinearity , supported only by the intrinsic gain and damping , without explicit external forcing or symmetry - breaking perturbations .",
    "the traveling soliton self - adjusts its internal parameters during the motion in order to travel with a constant velocity , leading to oscillations of its total power and hamiltonian . in most cases",
    "these oscillations are 1:1 locked to the translational motion , but in certain regimes period - doubling bifurcations to chaotically walking modes are observed , and likewise hopf - bifurcations to incommensurate oscillations and non - trivial phase - locking intervals may appear if also inter - site kerr nonlinearities are present . for pure on - site nonlinearity",
    "traveling solitons exist only in a rather narrow parameter regime , which widens considerably with the inclusion of inter - site nonlinearities , thereby reducing the peierls - nabarro potential obstructing the motion in the corresponding conservative system .",
    "the moving solitons can be divided into two types , between which bistability appears in certain regimes : fast modes with small oscillations , and slow modes with large oscillations .",
    "the former may even survive as exact traveling modes if a reasonably strong disorder is included , while the latter are highly sensitive to trapping .    in our model , the saturable gain and absorption result from the properties of the active optical fibers as described in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , in this model , all parameter values describing the gain and damping need to be nonzero for stable traveling localized solitons to exist ; e.g. , they would not exist for purely linear damping , or purely linear gain .",
    "evidently , it would be highly interesting to understand more precisely what are the necessary conditions for existence of traveling intrinsic gain - driven localized modes in more general physical lattice systems , not necessarily restricted to optics .",
    "one particularly interesting example concerns the so called quodons in layered crystals such as mica , where it has been suggested that nonlinear lattice excitations could travel for macroscopic distances by an energy gain resulting from the lattice being in a metastable configuration @xcite . in the optical context ,",
    "extensions to non - kerr nonlinearities and higher dimensions are also relevent , in particularly as it is known that saturable @xcite or quadratic @xcite nonlinearities may considerably decrease the peierls - nabarro barriers and increase mobility of localized modes also for two - dimensional lattices in the conservative case .",
