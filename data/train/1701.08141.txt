    "the question of how best to predict the evolution of a dynamical system has received substantial interest in the scientific community . while traditional mechanistic modeling approaches have dominated , data - driven approaches which rely on data to build predictive models have gained increasing popularity .",
    "the reality is , both approaches have their drawbacks and limitations . in this article",
    "we ask the question of whether or not a hybrid approach to prediction , which combines characteristics of both mechanistic modeling and data - driven modeling , can offer improvements over the standalone methodologies .",
    "we analyze the performance of these methods in two model systems and then evaluate them on experimentally collected population data .",
    "parametric modeling involves defining an underlying set of mechanistic equations which describe a system s dynamics .",
    "these mechanistic models often contain a number of unknown parameters as well as an uncertain state , both of which need to be quantified prior to use of the model for prediction .",
    "the success of parametric prediction is tied closely to the ability to construct accurate estimates of the model parameters and state .",
    "this can be particularly challenging in high dimensional estimation problems as well as in chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "additionally , there is often a degree of model error , or a discrepancy between the structure of the model and that of the system , further complicating the estimation process and hindering prediction accuracy .    despite these potential issues ,",
    "mechanistic models are frequently utilized in data analysis .",
    "the question we aim to address is when is it advantageous to use them ?",
    "under suitable conditions where model error is relatively small and parameters can be reliably estimated , parametric predictions can provide a great deal of accuracy .",
    "however , as we will see in the subsequent examples , a large uncertainty in the initial parameter values often leads to inaccurate estimates resulting in poor model - based predictions .",
    "an alternative approach to modeling and prediction abandons the use of any mechanistic equations , instead relying on predictive models built from data .",
    "these nonparametric methods have received considerable attention , in particular those methods based on takens delay - coordinate method for attractor reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the success of nonparametric methods is strongly influenced by the amount of data available as well as the dimension of the dynamical system . if only a sparse amount of training data is available , the result is often inaccurate predictions due to the lack of suitable nearby neighbors in delay - coordinate space .",
    "furthermore , as the dimension and complexity of the dynamical system increases , nonparametric prediction becomes significantly more difficult due to the necessary data requirements @xcite .",
    "several recent works have investigated the situation where only a portion of a mechanistic model is known @xcite .",
    "our motivation here though is to explore how best to use a full mechanistic model when it is available .",

    "a subset of a mechanistic model s equations are replaced by nonparametric evolution .",
    "these nonparametrically advanced variables are then incorporated into the remaining mechanistic equations during the data fitting and prediction process .",
    "the result of this approach is a more robust estimation of model parameters as well as an improvement in short - term prediction accuracy when initial parameter uncertainty is large .",
    "the utility of this method is demonstrated in several example systems .",
    "the assumption throughout is that noisy training data from a system are available as well as a mechanistic model that describes the underlying dynamics .",

    "<S> scientific analysis often relies on the ability to make accurate predictions of a system s dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> mechanistic models , parameterized by a number of unknown parameters , are often used for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> accurate estimation of the model state and parameters prior to prediction is necessary , but may be complicated by issues such as noisy data and uncertainty in parameters and initial conditions . at the other end of the spectrum exist nonparametric methods , which rely solely on data to build their predictions . </S>",
    "<S> while these nonparametric methods do not require a model of the system , their performance is strongly influenced by the amount and noisiness of the data . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a hybrid approach to modeling and prediction which merges recent advancements in nonparametric analysis with standard parametric methods . </S>",
    "<S> the general idea is to replace a subset of a mechanistic model s equations with their corresponding nonparametric representations , resulting in a hybrid modeling and prediction scheme . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find that this hybrid approach allows for more robust parameter estimation and improved short - term prediction in situations where there is a large uncertainty in model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate these advantages in the classical lorenz-63 chaotic system and in networks of hindmarsh - rose neurons before application to experimentally collected structured population data . </S>"
