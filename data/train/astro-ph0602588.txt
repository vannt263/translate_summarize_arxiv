    "the last decade has been characterized by the growing interest into the cosmic microwave background polarization ( cmbp ) , that has stimulated the design of polarimeters featured by low systematic effects and high sensitivity in microwave frequencies .",
    "the cmbp , in fact , is among the most powerful tool to investigate the early stages of the universe @xcite . due to the faint expected signal ( a few @xmath6k over the @xmath7 3 k unpolarized component ) , any instrumental effect that can produce spurious polarization must be analyzed in detail in order to minimize its impact .",
    "weak signals call for high sensitive radiometers that are usually realized by cooling down the front - end to cryogenic temperatures by means of cryostats . in radioastronomy ,",
    "homogeneous and low loss dielectric slabs are used to allow the signal to enter the cryostat ( e.g. see experiments in ref . ) .",
    "usually , such materials are considered isotropic and then not generating instrumental polarization .",
    "hence , no analysis is performed to study polarization effects related to isotropic flat dielectrics .",
    "this work arises from the need to investigate the linear instrumental polarization introduced by flat vacuum windows in microwave polarimeters when considered isotropic , thus providing the relationship with the material properties through either the complex dielectric constant or the complex index of refraction .",
    "however , the results reported in this paper are not exhaustive as far as the complete design of vacuum windows is concerned .",
    "other effects may occur to enhance the systematics , such as possible intrinsic or manufacturing induced birefringence of the sample @xcite , and the present work should be considered as a first attempting to investigate and minimize the spurious instrumental polarization that may arise from flat isotropic dielectric slabs .",
    "we find that a uniform diffuse radiation does not generate instrumental polarization , which , instead , is generated by anisotropic components ( e.g. cmb ) .",
    "we also estimate the amount of the effects in the specific case of isotropic dielectric which works in ka frequency band , centered at 32 ghz , an interesting band in microwave cosmology .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ is_diel_sp_pol ] ) we present the theoretical model used to derive the polarization effects introduced by flat isotropic dielectrics , while in section  ( [ is_diel ] ) we present the total intensity analysis which provides reflectance , transmittance and absorptance of the materials .",
    "measurements of their complex dielectric constants are presented in section ( [ micro_test ] ) and , finally , estimates of the spurious effects predicted by the model for the dielectrics experimentally investigated are reported in section ( [ application ] ) .",

    "( [ spt_beam_fig ] ) .",
    "such a level matches the requirements for cmbp experiments .",
    "the systematics generated by flat dielectric slabs prevail on that produced by good feeds for beams greater than @xmath7 15@xmath133 , thus requiring either thickness optimization analysis or the choice survey to control spurious polarizations .",

    "thanks to the selected thickness and materials , the loss of the polarized signal is marginal ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the thickness @xmath152 maximizing the transmittance also minimizes the depolarization ( see the magnified frame of right panel in fig .",

    "( [ leakage_isotropic_fig ] ) . for the selected thickness and materials ,",
    "the maximum leakage from @xmath187 to @xmath3 in the 30.433.6 ghz band is about 0.07@xmath188 .",
    "a more rigorous computation , which takes into account the beam pattern , provides the result shown in fig .",
    "( [ leakage_isotropic_fig ] ) ( bottom - left panel ) .",

    "+ we presented an overall analysis of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and isotropic dielectric at microwave frequencies , by analyzing transmittance , reflectance , absorptance , spurious polarization , leakage and depolarization by means of the mueller formalism .",
    "+ the important result is that spurious polarization , and leakage between the stokes parameters are produced even by optically isotropic dielectrics , but only when they are thermally inhomogeneous or the incident radiation is anisotropic . in particular , it has been provided an estimate of the expected systematic effects introduced by teflon , polypropylene and hdpe , together with algorithms for their thickness optimization to minimize the effects .",
    "+ measurements of dielectric constant and electric tangent loss of teflon , hdpe , polypropylene and nylon have been provided between 27 ghz and 37 ghz at 300 k of physical temperature .",

    "moreover , we found that no optical anisotropy at level of 1@xmath201 has been measured from our teflon sample about the index of refraction .",
    "+ the analysis shows that teflon , among the selected materials , is the best material in the investigated band which minimizes the systematic effects . + as discussed in section ( [ application ] ) , the optimal thickness to maximize transmission ( @xmath202 ) and reduce emission ( @xmath203 ) is @xmath204 cm .",
    "the maximum thermal noise introduced by this slab is 162 mk at a physical temperature of t@xmath205 k. this thickness , which minimizes also the transmitted spurious polarization ( @xmath0 , thus producing in emission a spurious level @xmath1 ) , the leakage ( @xmath2 from @xmath206 to @xmath4 , or @xmath187 to @xmath3 , @xmath7 5  @xmath199 10@xmath207 from @xmath99 to @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) and the depolarization ( @xmath7 1.3 @xmath199 10@xmath208 ) , corresponds to @xmath209 . broadly speaking , in the approximation of low absorbing material and high feed horn directivity ,",
    "such a thickness maximizes the transmission and reduces all the other effects .",
    "+ we have also shown that for dielectrics in far field regime , the transmitted spurious polarization prevails on the one produced by good feeds ( cross - polarization @xmath7  40 db ) for beams greater than @xmath7 15@xmath133 , thus showing the need of either thickness optimization analysis or the choice survey of flat dielectrics to control spurious polarizations .",
    "the position of such thicknesses , which set maxima and minima of the spurious response , depends on the beam adopted .",
