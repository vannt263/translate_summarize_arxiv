    "among the surprising effects recently discovered in quantum mechanics is that a quantum system retains a memory of its motion when it undergoes a cyclic evolution @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in the existence of the berry phase , a phase acquired by the quantum state of the system in addition to the better known dynamic phase .",
    "the berry phase is a purely geometrical effect that can be linked to the notion of parallel transport @xcite : it depends only on the area covered by the motion of the system , and is independent of details of how the motion is executed .",
    "berry phases have been demonstrated in a wide variety of systems @xcite , including nmr @xcite , the closely related technique of nqr @xcite , optical systems @xcite , and others .",
    "an equally exciting recent development in the field of quantum mechanics has been the discovery that quantum systems can be used to perform novel information processing tasks , including computations which are more efficient than any algorithm known on a classical computer  @xcite .",
    "quantum information processing requires the ability to execute conditional dynamics @xcite between two quantum bits ( qubits ) , where the state of one qubit influences the evolution of another qubit during a quantum computation .",
    "simple quantum information processing has been demonstrated using nmr @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "recent experimental work has managed to combine these two quantum phenomena in the form of geometric quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "( for a more abstract approach see @xcite . ) in this paper we seek to detail the theoretical ideas behind geometric quantum computation . in particular we show that berry s phase may be used to implement conditional phase shifts , and thus any quantum gate  @xcite .",
    "we begin with brief introductions to both quantum gates and networks as well as to geometric phases , proceeding to analyse the dynamics of a spin - half system in order to see in detail how the theory of geometric phases applies there .",
    "finally , we extend the ideas to pairs of spin - half particles , showing how to introduce a conditional geometric phase between the two particles .",
    "a _ qubit _ is a quantum system in which the boolean states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are represented by a prescribed pair of normalised and mutually orthogonal quantum states labeled as @xmath2 . unlike a simple boolean variable , a qubit ,",
    "typically a microscopic system such as an atom , a nuclear spin , or a polarised photon , can exist in an arbitrary superposition @xmath3 , making it more powerful as a computational resource .    in quantum computation , we set some _ register _ of qubits to an `` input '' state , evolve the qubits unitarily using simple building - block operations and then take the final state as `` output '' .",
    "more formally , a _",
    "quantum logic gate _ is a device which performs a fixed unitary operation on selected qubits in a fixed period of time and a _ quantum network _ is a device consisting of quantum logic gates whose computational steps are synchronised in time  @xcite .",
    "the outputs of some of the gates are connected by wires to the inputs of others .",
    "the _ size _ of the network is the number of gates it contains .",
    "the most common quantum gate is the hadamard gate , a single qubit gate @xmath4 performing the unitary transformation known as the hadamard transform .",
    "it is defined as @xmath5 the matrix is written in the computational basis @xmath6 and the diagram on the right provides a schematic representation of the gate @xmath4 acting on a qubit in state @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the addition of another single qubit gate , the phase shift gate @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , or , in matrix notation , @xmath12 is actually sufficient to construct the following network ( of size four ) , which generates the most general pure state of a single qubit ( up to a global phase ) , @xmath13 consequently , the hadamard and phase gates are sufficient to construct _ any _ unitary operation on a single qubit .",
    "thus the hadamard gates and the phase gates can be used to transform the input state @xmath14 of @xmath15 qubits into any state of the type @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary superposition of @xmath20 and @xmath21 these are rather special @xmath15-qubit states , called the product states or the separable states . in general , a register of @xmath15 qubits can be prepared in states which are not separable , known as entangled states .",
    "however , in order to entangle two or more qubits it is necessary to have access to two - qubit gates .",
    "one such gate is the controlled phase shift gate @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 the matrix is written in the computational basis @xmath24 @xmath25 and the diagram on the right shows the structure of the gate .      an important result in the theory of quantum computation states that the hadamard gate , and all @xmath22 controlled phase gates form a _ universal set of gates _ : if the hadamard gate as well as all @xmath22 gates are available then any @xmath15-qubit unitary operation can be simulated exactly with less than @xmath26 such gates , for some constant @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "consequently , being able to implement 1 and 2-qubit phase gates is of crucial importance in quantum computation . in this paper",
    "we describe a new method for implementing the controlled phase gates based explicitly on geometric phases  @xcite rather than dynamic ones .",
    "the states of a quantum system are usually described as being represented by vectors of norm 1 ( @xmath28 ) in a complex hilbert space @xmath29 . however , there is redundancy in this description since the state @xmath30 is physically indistinguishable from the state @xmath31 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to consider instead the projective space @xmath32 , in which vectors are grouped into equivalence classes under the relation @xmath33 for any @xmath34 and real @xmath35 , thereby eliminating the ambiguity .",
    "the associated projection map is @xmath36 =                                \\left\\{\\ket{\\psi ' } :                                  \\ket{\\psi'}=r e^{i\\phi}\\ket{\\psi}\\right\\}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    if a system undergoes a cyclic evolution , the ket representing the system state traces out a path , @xmath37\\longrightarrow\\hilb$ ] , where @xmath38 is a closed curve in @xmath32 , as illustrated in figure  [ cyclic ] . in other words",
    ", the initial and final states should be on the same ray in @xmath29 , but may be related by a phase , @xmath39 .",
    "we will measure this phase with respect to a reference curve in @xmath29 : for each point @xmath40 on @xmath41 , we can choose a smoothly varying representative @xmath42 from @xmath43 in such a way that @xmath44 .",
    "we can then write @xmath45 so that the phase change of @xmath46 associated with the cyclic evolution is given by @xmath47 .",

    "let @xmath111 be the closed curve in @xmath32 traced out by @xmath112 during the first cyclic evolution and @xmath113 the one traced out by @xmath114 , with corresponding dynamic and geometric phases @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . referring back to eq .",
    "( [ ephasehalf ] ) we see that @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "similarly , if we write @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the second cyclic evolution , these are simply @xmath111 and @xmath113 carried out in opposite orientations so they have corresponding phases @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in summary , we can follow the states through the compound evolution as follows : @xmath126 since the global phase factor @xmath127 is not physical this sequence of operations behaves as promised .",
    "the dynamic phases are eliminated and we are left with an exclusively geometric phase difference of @xmath128 .",
    "this geometric phase can be used to implement a 2-qubit controlled - phase gate . consider to begin with a system of two non - interacting spin - half particles @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in a reference frame",
    "aligned with the static field , the hamiltonian reads @xmath131 or , in the basis @xmath132 , @xmath133 where the frequencies @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the transition frequencies of the two spins and we have used the scaled pauli operators @xmath136 .",
    "( from now on we assume that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are very different with @xmath139 . )    if the two particles are sufficiently close to each other , they will interact , creating additional splittings between the energy levels . in the case of two spin - half particles ,",

    "we have seen that the berry phase acquired by a spin depends on its transition resonance frequency as given by eq .",
    "( [ costheta ] ) .",
    "therefore , at the end of a cyclic evolution , the berry phase acquired by the spin @xmath129 will be different for the two possible states of spin @xmath130 .",
    "indeed , when spin @xmath130 is in state @xmath158 , the berry phase acquired by the spin @xmath129 is @xmath162 , with the sign negative or positive depending on whether spin @xmath129 is up or down , respectively , and @xmath163 similarly , when spin @xmath130 is in state @xmath160 , the berry phase acquired by the spin @xmath129 is @xmath164 where @xmath165 as in the single - particle case , it is necessary to eliminate the dynamic phase in order to construct a purely geometric conditional phase gate .",
    "this can be accomplished using almost the same technique as in the single - particle case described in section [ selimination ] .",
    "in this case , however , we must apply the sequence of operations @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are @xmath110-pulses applied to particles @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively , and @xmath41 and @xmath171 are adiabatic transformations as in section [ selimination ] . if we define the differential berry phase shift @xmath172 then the net transformation , up to global phases , is given by @xmath173 thus , we have succeeded in engineering a conditional evolution since the state of the qubit @xmath130 influences the phase acquired by a second qubit @xmath129.@xcite this gate , which introduces a phase of @xmath174 if the two spins are aligned and @xmath175 if they are anti - aligned , is equivalent to the controlled phase gate introduced in section [ sbasics ]  @xcite .",
    "the form of the dependence of @xmath176 on the detuning @xmath177 and the amplitude of the oscillating field @xmath97 builds into the geometric phase gate a natural type of fault tolerance not present in the simple non - geometric conditional phase gate . in many experiments , such as nmr , it is easy to control the detuning quite precisely , but relatively difficult to control the amplitude of the oscillating field .",
    "figure [ gfaulttolerance ] plots @xmath176 as a function of these parameters in units of @xmath178 for a range of values : for fixed @xmath177 , we see that there is a peak in @xmath176 as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath97 is chosen to coincide with this peak then @xmath176 will be insensitive to errors in @xmath97 to first order .",
    "as the height of the peak depends on the detuning , any desired controlled phase gate can be achieved .",
    "the techniques described in this paper constitute a novel approach to quantum computation , one that builds entangling gates entirely out of conditional geometric phases .",
    "these techniques are readily implementable with current technology in quantum optics and have already been demonstrated by some of the authors using nmr  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to further analyse the robustness of geometric quantum computation to errors . while it has been observed that geometric phases are robust to certain types of noise in the classical parameters controlling the hamiltonian , it has not been determined how geometric phases behave in the presence of decoherence or depolarisation of the quantum system .",
