    "the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) theory is a successful marriage between standard friedmann cosmology and nuclear physics , explaining the origin and abundances of the light elements d , @xmath1he , @xmath2he and @xmath3li .",
    "its only one input parameter , the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the number density of baryons and photons ) has now been determined by the observations of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) with rather good accuracy @xcite , so that there are essentially no free parameters in this scenario . because the bbn predictions are sensitive to a set of physical quantities which depend on various fundamental constants such as the gauge couplings , the yukawa couplings and gravitational constant ( see sections iii and iv for details ) , it would provide stringent constraints on the cosmological variations of these constants .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors use bbn to constrain the change of fine structure constant , in @xcite constraints on the change of higgs vacuum expectation value are considered , and the effects of a varying strong coupling are discussed in _ e.g. _ @xcite ; the variation of gravitational constant has also been investigated @xcite in the context of bbn . besides , there is another reason for the interests in the interplay between varying fundamental constants and bbn : in contrast to the excellent consistency between bbn theory and observation with @xmath7 given by wmap for the deuteron ( d ) abundance , the predicted @xmath1he and @xmath3li abundances are smaller than the results implied by wmap @xcite ; it is then suggested that the variations of fundamental constants such as the fine structure constant @xcite or the deuteron binding energy @xmath8 @xcite ( @xmath8 itself is certainly not a fundamental constant , but its variation possibly originates from some other fundamental constants as suggested in @xcite ) _ etc_. might partly or completely solve this discrepancy .",
    "the theoretical investigations of varying fundamental constants date back to the early work of dirac in 1930 s , and have re - aroused great attentions because of the recent discovery of webb _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that the quasar absorption lines at redshifts of @xmath9 = 1 @xmath10 3 suggest a small evolution of the fine structure constant between that period and present .",
    "although variations of the fundamental constants do not occur in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the two leading paradigms of the physics beyond sm , namely the string theory @xcite and the kaluza klein theory @xcite , generally predict such variations . in these scenarios a dilaton field or the size of extra dimensions may evolve cosmologically ; thus until their vacuum expectation values ( vev ) are fixed , there might be a co - variation of several fundamental constants .",
    "this picture is similar to the discussions in grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite and implies that considerations of one varying constant alone may be incomplete , although indeed such a co - variation itself is in general rather model - dependent ( see @xcite for one case derived from string theory ) . for a detailed discussion of the theoretical and observational ( experimental ) aspects of varying fundamental constants , see @xcite .",
    "the recent interests in the extra dimensional theories have stimulated other considerations of varying fundamental constants .",
    "of the frequently discussed extra dimension models , the original add @xcite and rs @xcite brane models do not induce changes in the gauge couplings even though their moduli fields evolve @xcite because of the conformal invariance of the gauge kinetic terms ( see however @xcite for an alternative ) , and so in this work we will concentrate on the universal extra dimension ( ued ) model , in which the fields can propagate in all dimensions .",
    "this model was first proposed in @xcite and became extremely interesting for cosmology since it was found later that it predicted the presence of a stable massive particle , the lightest kk partner ( lkp ) , which is a natural dark matter candidate ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "our purpose in this work is twofold : firstly , we study how the fundamental constants in the low energy effective theory change if the size of the universal extra dimensions , the radion field , undergoes a slow cosmological evolution and to what extent the changes are allowed by the bbn observations ; secondly , we show that if the volume of the extra space at the time of bbn is slightly larger than its present value , the discrepancy between bbn and wmap discussed above may be reduced .",
    "the arrangement of this work is the following : in section ii we derive the effective low energy actions for the gravitational and matter sectors in the model ; then we shall find the radion dependences of the fundamental constants in section iii .",
    "in section iv we briefly review the standard bbn , point out the most relevant physical quantities for its prediction and relate these quantities to the radion field .",
    "section v contains the numerical results of this work , which are obtained by modifying the standard code of bbn @xcite and including the effects discussed in section iv .",
    "finally section vi is devoted to discussion and conclusion . throughout this work",

    "note that in @xcite the authors , while quoting their results in terms of the pion mass @xmath186 , were varying the ratio of the quark mass to @xmath70 , and so they indeed showed a range of @xmath8 vs @xmath186 which is effectively a function @xcite ( using eq .",

    "( 43 ) and the theoretical cross section for @xmath181 , it is then straightforward to obtain the radion - dependence ( @xmath75-dependence ) of the thermo - averaged rate for this reaction .    for the other two neutron - induced reactions @xmath201 and @xmath202 , there is no theoretical calculation like that for @xmath180 , and so we simply use the data - fitting results and neglect their coupling dependences .",

    "the effects of a larger @xmath75 other than that of @xmath8 come mainly from the coulomb barrier : the charged - particle - induced reaction rates will be less suppressed since both @xmath86 and @xmath15 are smaller in this case , consequently more @xmath206 is processed and more @xmath136 is produced . to see this point more explicitly , we plot in fig .",

    "however , the inclusion of varying @xmath8 ( as in fig .",
    "1 ) changes these abundances dramatically , indicating the important role of the deuteron binding energy in bbn @xcite .",
    "our results as shown in fig .",
    "1 suggest that the discrepancy between the standard bbn theory and wmap observations tends to be reduced if @xmath75 is greater than 1 @xcite . using the wmap - implied value of @xmath7 @xcite , the standard bbn can reproduce the observed d abundance , but not the @xmath132 and @xmath136 abundances ; an @xmath7 smaller than the wmap value is needed to obtain the observed @xmath132 and ( or ) @xmath136 abundances . while this discrepancy may result from some systematic errors in the @xmath132 and @xmath136 observations , the possibility of nonstandard bbn or new physics can not be excluded .",
    "in fact , there have been many attempts of solving this discrepancy from a theoretical aspect , for example , by nonstandard expansion rate @xcite , varying fine structure constant @xcite , and lepton asymmetry @xcite _ etc_. these effects separately can not solve the whole inconsistency and a combination of them is needed , _ e.g. _ @xcite ( there are also works which use a single quantity to account for the inconsistency , such as a varying deuteron binding energy @xcite and the brans - dicke cosmology with a varying @xmath207 term @xcite ) .",
    "but from a theoretical viewpoint , such combinations may not be necessary since , as mentioned in the introduction , the variation of one fundamental constant will often be accompanied by the variations of some other constants ; these changes together would play the role of several effects combined . because the co - variation of the fundamental constants is rather model - dependent , a general study is not practical .",
    "our present work serves as a specific example and shows how the variations of several fundamental constants are correlated with one parameter @xmath75 and driven by the same physics - in this case , the variation of the volume of extra - dimensional space .    in fig .",

    "in summary , we have considered in this work the implications of a slowly evolving radion field on the fundamental constants and the big bang nucleosynthesis predictions in the context of the universal extra dimensions model . we have included in our modified bbn code various effects of the varying constants , of which the most important ones being the neutron - proton mass difference , the deuteron binding energy , the free neutron lifetime and the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "these effects may act in either the same or the opposite directions and lead to distinct and complex behaviors of the light nuclei yields .",
    "we have also calculated the chi - squared as a function of @xmath75 , the ratio between the extra space volumes at the time of bbn and now , and @xmath7 , the baryon - to - photon ratio ; this analysis then gives a bound on the variation of the fine structure constant as @xmath232 at 68% c. l. and @xmath233 at 95% c. l. the allowed range for @xmath234 in our result is much larger than that obtained from quasar absorption systems @xcite , which is @xmath235 .",
    "however , because bbn probes physics up to redshifts of order @xmath236 while the quasar absorption systems are at @xmath237 , there should be no apparent inconsistency .    it is suggested that a larger extra dimension size at the time of bbn may help reduce the discrepancy between the bbn theory and observation , and here we make several comments about this conclusion .",
    "firstly , the expression for the neutron - proton mass difference @xmath139 ( eq .  ( 32 ) ) is phenomenological but reasonable , even though it may not be definitive @xcite ; we here use it because it is the most - commonly - used and we find no competing ones . secondly , there is an uncertainty for the parameter @xmath188 in the deuteron binding energy formula ( eq .  ( 41 ) ) derived by the effective field theory , but as we stated above , changing @xmath188 from 10 to 6 only induces a small variation of the numerical results while having no influence on the qualitative features we have discussed .",
    "thirdly , our discussion on the variations of nuclear reaction rates follows that in @xcite and we have neglected several effects due to the lack of theoretical understandings for them .",
    "one example is the influence of a varying @xmath8 on the reaction rates of @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , which are dominant or subdominant in the destruction of @xmath120 .",
    "lacking an explicit expression for this effect , we choose not to include it in the modified code .",
    "instead we can make an estimation about the error introduced by neglecting it , by assuming the cross sections of these reactions to scale with the deuteron radius and thus @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath243 @xcite . adopting this parametrization in the code",
    ", we find that the outputs of @xmath120 , @xmath172 and @xmath244 are changed by @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 respectively in our interested range of @xmath248 ( see fig .  4 ) , which lie well within the corresponding @xmath208 observational uncertainties ( @xmath249 for @xmath120 , @xmath250 for @xmath172 and @xmath251 for @xmath244 ) .",
    "another example is the influence of resonances in some key cross sections such as those of @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath252 .",
    "these resonant terms are generally of the form @xcite @xmath253\\ ] ] in which @xmath254 is a function of the temperature and @xmath255 is the resonance energy . without a reliable calculation of how these terms depend on the strong coupling , we roughly estimate the corrections from them by assuming @xmath256 . then using the fitting values of @xmath255 in these cross sections @xcite in the modified code we find that the @xmath120 and @xmath257 abundances decrease by @xmath258 and @xmath259 in the same range of @xmath248 as above , while the @xmath260 output stays essentially unchanged .",
    "these values again fall well in the corresponding observational uncertainties .",
    "although the points discussed in this paragraph would not change our results much , they do reflect the important role these effects play in reducing possible errors , and in any case the precisions of the bbn constraints will improve with future progress in particle and nuclear physics relevant for these topics .",
    "it is also interesting to look at whether the allowed range for @xmath75 in our constraint would imply additional effects that are too large to be dangerous for other observations , such as the existence of bound di - proton / di - neutron and the stability of @xmath261 .",
    "it is well known that the bound di - proton will open a rapid channel for the hydrogen fusion @xcite and thus be catastrophic to the star lifetimes . the binding condition for di - nucleon systems",
    "was considered by , _ _ e.g .  _",
    "_ dent and fairbairn @xcite , and a rough criterion for these systems to be stable was a decrease of @xmath262 to @xmath263 of its present day value ( see @xcite for more details ) , which is much larger than our constrained range for the gauge coupling variations .",
    "the stability of @xmath264 is also important in the consideration of varying fundamental constants as , if stable , @xmath264 would fill the mass-5 gap in the bbn nuclear reaction chain , drastically enhancing the production of @xmath257 .",
    "this issue was discussed by , _ _ e.g .  _",
    "_ flambaum and shuryak @xcite , and it was found there that the limit from @xmath264 binding can not compete with that from @xmath8 .",
    "for example , even the more stringent criterion to avoid a stable @xmath264 quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath265 , is well satisfied by our @xmath266 range of @xmath75 .    as a final point",
    ", we comment on the choices of observational @xmath260 and @xmath257 abundances . the value given in eq .",
    "( 44 ) is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and is certainly not the only observational result of @xmath267 .",
    "other data analysis give different results , such as @xmath268 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath269 in ref .",
    "it is apparent from figs .  1 and 3 that , if these larger abundances are used , the @xmath260 contour will shift rightward .",

    "1 and 3 we see that , with the latter result adopted , the right branch of the @xmath257 contour ( which we are interested in ) will shift leftward .",

    "<S> the successful prediction of light element abundances from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) has been a pillar of the standard model of cosmology . because many of the relevant reaction rates are sensitive to the values of fundamental constants , such as the fine structure constant and the strong coupling constant , bbn is a useful tool to probe and to put constraints on possible cosmological variations of these constants , which arise naturally from many versions of extra - dimensional theories . in this paper , we study the dependences of fundamental constants on the radion field of the universal extra dimension model , and calculate the effects of such varying constants on bbn . </S>",
    "<S> we also discussed the possibility that the discrepancy between bbn and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data on the baryon - to - photon ratio can be reduced if the volume of the extra dimensions was slightly larger - by @xmath0 - at the bbn era compared to its present value , which would result in smaller gauge couplings at bbn by the same factor . </S>"
