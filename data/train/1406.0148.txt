    "during the early stages of the cell cycle the mammalian genome is organized in chromosome territories @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "when dna damaging agents , such as radiation , cross the cell nucleus they introduce double strand breaks that produce chromosome fragments .",
    "these chromosome fragments need to be rejoined with their original partners for the cell to survive .",
    "a small percentage of breaks however are incorrectly rejoined introducing exchange type chromosome aberrations ( etcas ) .",
    "etcas between non - homologue chromosomes can be detected in the laboratory by means of diverse chromosome painting and sequencing techniques ( see figure [ sky_image ] for an example of etcas detected by the chromosome painting technique sky ) .",
    "it is expected that chromosomes that are in close spatial proximity form etcas more often than those that are far apart @xcite .",
    "therefore the frequency of etcas between non - homologous chromosomes is informative of their relative position and it can be used to reconstruct the three dimensional structure of the genome .",
    "chromosome painting techniques such fluorescence in - situ hybridization ( fish ) or its multicolor versions such as spectral karyotyping ( sky ) and multiplex fish ( mfish ) @xcite paint every pair of homologue chromosomes the same color ( figure [ sky_image ] ) .",
    "these techniques have shown that the position of chromosome territories with respect to the center of the nucleus is driven by gene density , chromosome size and/or local chromatin geometry @xcite . in human lymphocytes gene - rich chromosomes such as \\{1 , 19 , 17 , 22 } are located near the center of the nucleus @xcite while gene - poor chromosomes such as @xmath0 are located closer to the periphery of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "studies measuring the relative position of chromosomes , using radiation induced etcas , on the other hand have shown that chromosomes are randomly located with respect to each other with the exception of a few chromosome clusters @xcite .",
    "interestingly this overall random relative organization has been corroborated by new sequencing techniques @xcite .",
    "quantification of the relative position of chromosome territories commonly use tables whose entries are the number of etcas detected for any two non - homologue chromosomes such as the one we use in table [ table : lympho2004 ] .",
    "several methods have been proposed to study frequency tables of radiation induced etcas . in @xcite tables of radiation",
    "induced etcas detected by fish were analyzed . in this type of studies frequency tables",
    "were densely populated and with large entries , therefore chi - square statistics were used to find significant clusters of chromosomes . in @xcite similar tables were generated employing mfish data . although more accurate in some respects , the latter data were more sparse and with small entries . in this case",
    "the proximity of chromosome territories was tested by assigning p - values to clusters of previously reported chromosome territories .",
    "here we propose a model - based approach that builds a simple log - linear model to test the proximity of pairs of chromosome territories , referred to as chromosome pairs from now on , and we use a markov chain monte carlo method based on the theory of algebraic statistics to assign significance .",
    "the mfish data we analyze have already appeared in the literature @xcite .    in our study",
    "we test a no - proximity effect model and a single pair proximity model by sampling tables that have the same sufficient statistic as those observed experimentally .",
    "sampling of the tables is performed by running a markov chain monte carlo algorithm that uses a markov basis @xcite for a second hypersimplex @xcite .",
    "this kind of method is one of the early contributions of algebraic statistics , hence `` classical algebraic statistics '' in the title of this work .",
    "our results indicate that we could not reject the hypothesis of random relative arrangement of chromosome territories when radiation induced chromosome aberrations were analyzed .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with previous studies @xcite and suggests that the specific positions of any two pairs of chromosomes do not influence the frequency of aberrations observed .",
    "however , by assuming the existence of a proximity biasing factor we found chromosome pairs @xmath1 and @xmath2 to be significant . we conclude that methods develop in algebraic statistics are suitable for analyzing genetic data of moderate size in which data sparsity or low numbers of measurements are present .",
    "to test for proximity of chromosome territories we used a radiation induced exchange type chromosome aberration table published in @xcite . in these experiments cells from healthy donors were irradiated with sparsely ionizing @xmath3-rays at different doses , and mfish @xcite was used to detect etcas .",
    "this table includes a total of 3585 records of human peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with sparsely ionizing radiation at different doses .",
    "the frequency of etcas was summarized by recording the number of cells in which at least one exchange between two non - homologous chromosomes occurred .",
    "this quantity is robust with respect to noise introduced by apparently incomplete aberrations ( i.e. those aberrations with not all fragments accounted for ) and reduces false positives .",
    "following previous publications @xcite we denote these values by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the chromosomes that participate in the exchange .",
    "these values are presented in table [ table : lympho2004 ] as a @xmath7 upper - triangular table .",
    ".table of etcas in 3585 human lymphocytes as reported in @xcite .",
    "each entry @xmath4 holds the number of cells in which at least one exchange between chromosomes @xmath5 and @xmath6 was recorded .",
    "the total number of cells in which a given chromosome was involved in at least one exchange appears in the `` sum '' column .

    "these chromosomes include those that are found in the center of the nucleus @xcite and those that form the nucleolus @xcite .",
    "this observation is further supported by the large positive deviations between entries in the experimentally observed table and the mle table .",
    "the differences between the observed table and the mle table are shown in table [ table : lympho2004dev ] .",
    "a positive entry indicates that the observed table had more exchanges than the number predicted by the mle table while a negative entry shows cases where the mle table had more exchanges than the observed table .",
    "the largest positive entries in the table are those for chromosome pairs \\{1,22 } , \\{13,14 } , \\{1,15 } , and \\{9,18}. we therefore tested all chromosome pairs on the single - pair proximity effect model and performed the log - ratio tests considering the original log - linear models against the modified modelsfor all chromosome pairs .",
    "we found eight pairs of chromosome pairs that were significant ( column 1 in table [ table : pval ] ) .",
    "however only two of them were significant after correction for multiple testing using bonferroni @xcite ( column 4 in table [ table : pval ] ) .",
    "in this work we have presented a model - based approach to determine the relative positioning of chromosome territories from etca frequency tables that are sparse and with small entries . in previous work a method for dealing with small entries was reported @xcite , however the assignment of p - values to specific clusters of chromosome territories was based on groups of chromosomes previously found in the literature .",
    "our method builds on the techniques developed in classical algebraic statistics by diaconis and sturmfels @xcite .",
    "our results show that the overall distribution of chromosome exchanges can be simply explained by a model in which the relative position of chromosome territories is random .",
    "this finding does not quantitatively agree with the results reported in @xcite since a small deviation from randomness was reported in those studies .",
    "however all studies agree upon a rather random organization of chromosome territories .",
    "several sources can be contributing to this apparently random organization of the genome .",
    "the first is imposed by the limitation of the data .",
    "chromosome painting techniques are limited by the fact that homologue chromosomes are painted the same color , and this evidently introduces unavoidable noise since territories of homologous chromosomes can be positioned in very different environments ( i.e. with different neighbouring chromosome territories ) .",
    "it is also possible that cell to cell variation is very large or that there is a severe reorganization of the chromosome territories after the radiation insult .",
    "the fact that new sequencing analysis is consistent with this overall picture suggest that radiation has a small repositioning effect .",
    "our study shows that a small fraction of chromosome pairs deviate from this picture of random etca formation .",
    "we identified eight pairs of chromosome territories that were significant prior to multiple testing correction ( table 4 ) .",
    "the first two pairs of chromosome territories ( ie . @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) were also significant in @xcite .",
    "there is an easy explanation for the significance of these pairs although their true functional significance remains to be determined @xcite .",
    "the pair @xmath2 is part of the cluster of chromosomes in the nucleolus @xmath16 , an organelle that brings chromosome territories together for specific needs of the cell .",
    "the second pair @xmath1 has been found to be part of a cluster of chromosome territories @xmath17 located in the center of the nucleus of lymphocyte cells .",
    "we used a bonferroni correction method for multiple testing .",
    "this method is known to be very conservative and it is possible that we rejected some informative pairs .",
    "in fact all the pairs that were not significant after bonferroni correction have been reported in several clinical blood malignancies suggesting that proximity of these pairs of chromosome territories may be somewhat common and furthermore may have an important role in the development of these diseases @xcite .",
    "it is our intention to improve our results by including better outlier detection tools that help identify other chromosome pairs @xcite and by incorporating these results into the developent of biophysical models .",
    "these models are based on different properties of the genome that can obtained from basic physical priciples such as the radial organization of chromosomes using overlapping sphere or ellipsoid packings @xcite , gene density @xcite or dna decondensation processes @xcite or through the folding of chromatin fibers @xcite    * acknowledgements * this work is partially supported by nsf grant dms-1217324 and nih grant ro1-gm109457 to j. arsuaga .",
    "we want to thank j. l. garca from centro de investigaci del cancer de la universidad de salamanca ( spain ) for sharing figure 1 .",
    "in this last section we return to our remark that none of the @xmath18 tables generated for table [ table : lympho2004 ] in our mcmc procedure had a test statistic smaller than @xmath19 . in order to give a heuristic explanation for this behavior we will estimate the size of @xmath20 and also estimate the size of the set of the tables @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "we first give a lower bound for the cardinality of @xmath20 , which is the set of lattice points in a polytope . a standard computational tool such as latte @xcite can not compute the cardinality of this immensely large set .",
    "instead we employ a divide - and - conquer approach where we consider the subtables consisting of the chromosomes 1 through 8 ( subtable a ) , chromosomes 8 through 15 ( subtable b ) , chromosomes 15 through 22 ( subtable c ) in table [ subtables : lympho2004 ] .",
    "the @xmath5th entry in the _ sum _ column in each subtable refers to the sum of @xmath4 over all chromosomes @xmath24 included in the subtable .",
    "see for instance @xmath25 in subtable a in table [ subtables : lympho2004 ] .",
    "the remaining entries of table [ table : lympho2004 ] were subdivided into six rectangular subtables .",
    "each of these subtables are indexed by two subsets of chromosomes @xmath26 and @xmath27 : subtable 1 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , subtable 2 ( @xmath30 , @xmath29 ) , subtable 3 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , subtable 4 ( @xmath33 , @xmath32 ) , subtable 5 ( @xmath34 , @xmath32 ) , subtable 6 ( @xmath35 , @xmath32 ) in table [ subtables2:lympho2004 ] .        in the above tables ,",
    "the @xmath5th entry in the rsum column refers to the sum of the numbers in the @xmath5th row in the corresponding table , and the @xmath6th entry in the csum row refers to the sum of the numbers in the @xmath6th column in the corresponding table .",
    "any table that has been subdivided in a total of @xmath37 subtables where subtables @xmath38 have same sum column as in the subtables @xmath38 of the data table and where subtables @xmath39 have the same rsum and csum columns / rows as in subtables @xmath39 of the data table is in @xmath20 .",
    "so a lower bound for the cardinality of @xmath20 can be obtained by the product of the number of subtables of type @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the given sum and rsum / csum columns / rows .",
    "the total number of such subtables range from @xmath42 for table a to @xmath43 for table [ subtables2:lympho2004 ] .",
    "the exact number of tables calculated by latte @xcite are shown in table [ latte : lympho2004 ] .",
    "the product of these numbers is in the order of @xmath45 .",
    "this estimate however can be improved by the following arguments .",
    "most of the @xmath46 markov moves can be applied to table [ table : lympho2004 ] without changing the sum column .",
    "the few moves that can not be applied are those that make the @xmath47 entry negative .",
    "in addition , only @xmath48 moves will not change the sum or rsum / csum entries of the above 9 subtables since the moves occur completely inside each of the subtables .",
    "the remaining @xmath49 markov moves will alter at least two of these subtables so that their sum and/or rsum / csum entries will change . if we repeat the above latte calculations for the nine subtables obtained after the application of each one of these @xmath49 markov moves ( in other words those that change sum and/or rsum / csum ) we will find that the number of these new tables will be again of the order @xmath50 .",
    "we can repeat the same argument when two or more markov moves are considered .",
    "for instance if we applied exactly 30 markov moves of the 27706 possible moves in sequence then we would obtain a total number of new tables in @xmath51 given by @xmath52 times @xmath53 this is approximately @xmath54 .",
    "this calculation however may have some tables that are counted more than once because two distinct sequences of moves starting from table [ table : lympho2004 ] can lead to the same table .",
    "this overcounting should be more than compensated by tables that could be reached with more or fewer than @xmath55 moves . in conclusion",
    "we estimate that a lower bound of @xmath56 possible tables is justified , but to be on the safe side we adopt @xmath57 as a very conservative estimation of the possible size of @xmath51 .",
    "now we provide a very liberal upper bound on the number of tables whose @xmath58 value is smaller than the @xmath58 value of the data table ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the volume @xmath60 of the ellipsoid defined by equation ( [ chi - square ] ) is bounded above by @xmath61 using the volume formula for multidimensional ellipsoids .",
    "it is known that the number of lattice points in an @xmath62-dimensional ellipsoid defined by @xmath63 is approximately equal to @xmath64 @xcite and in our case @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and we arrive at @xmath67 as an upper bound on the number of tables which are inside the ellipsoid defined by ( [ chi - square ] ) .",
    "we note that this must be a gross estimate , since we should be counting the tables in the ellipsoid that are also in the fiber @xmath51 .",
    "for this we should be counting the lattice points in another ellipsoid of lower dimension @xmath68 .",
    "we conclude that a very conservative estimate of proportion of tables @xmath21 where @xmath69 in @xmath51 is extremely small : @xmath70 we believe that the true proportion is much smaller .",
