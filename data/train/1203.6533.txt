    "the energy mesh of the present calculations substantially differs from that of our previous theoretical treatment on photoionization of c@xmath0 ions @xcite . due to the large calculational effort required when using a fine mesh ,",
    "the energy steps were chosen to be 1.36 mev in that previous investigation , i.e. they were a factor 100 more coarse than in the present study .",
    "the effect of the size of the energy mesh is discussed in the results section of this paper .",

    "the experiment was performed at the ion - photon - beam ( ipb ) end - station of the undulator beamline 10.0.1 at the als .",
    "a detailed description of the experimental setup has been provided by covington @xcite . for the present study on be - like c@xmath0 , n@xmath1 , and o@xmath2 ions similar procedures were utilized as in our earlier photoionization cross section measurements for be - like boron and carbon ions @xcite .",
    "the berylliumlike ions were generated inside a compact all  permanent - magnet electron cyclotron - resonance ( ecr ) ion source @xcite .",
    "collimated ion - beam currents of typically 30 to 100  na were extracted by putting the ion source on a positive potential fixed between + 5 and + 6.5  kv .",
    "the ions were then passed through a bending dipole magnet selecting the desired ratio of charge to mass .",
    "the mass- and charge - selected ion beam was centered onto the counterpropagating photon beam by applying appropriate voltages to several electrostatic ion beam steering and focusing devices .",
    "downstream of the interaction region , the ion beam was deflected out of the photon beam direction by a second dipole magnet that also separated the ionized c@xmath1 ( n@xmath2 , o@xmath15 ) product ions from the respective c@xmath0 , ( n@xmath1 , o@xmath2 ) parent ions .",
    "the product ions were counted with nearly 100% efficiency using suitable single - particle detection @xcite , and the parent ion current was monitored for normalization .",
    "the measured product count rate @xmath39 was only partly due to photoionization events .",
    "it also contained identical ions produced by electron removal collisions of the parent ions with residual gas molecules and surfaces .",
    "this background was determined by mechanically chopping the photon beam .    in the present experiments",
    "relative energy - scan measurements were carried out by stepping the photon energy through a preset range of values at different photon beam energy resolutions .",
    "the desired experimental energy spread was preselected by adjusting monochromator settings of the beamline accordingly .",
    "it is not possible , however , to choose a well defined resolution by just setting the monochromator slits .",
    "the real resolution has to be determined from the measured results after the experiment .",
    "the reason for this is in the slit geometry and the small size of the photon beam at the entrance slit of the monochromator in the beamline used .",
    "measurements were pushed to the practical limits of resolution which were mainly determined by limitations in the signal - to - background ratios acceptable for experiments and by the photon beamtime available , since finer energy steps are needed to resolve features at higher resolution . resolving powers @xmath40 of more than 20,000",
    "were reached .",
    "the scan data were normalized to absolute measurements available from previous work @xcite .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty of the cross sections thus determined is about @xmath4120  % .",
    "additional uncertainty arises from the presence of unknown fractions of metastable and ground - state ions in the parent beams .",
    "the energy scales of the experiments are calibrated with uncertainties of 1 to 10  mev depending on photon energy .",
    "the calibration was accomplished by carrying out separate photoionization measurements with neutral he , ar ( l - shell resonances in 2@xmath42 order ) , and kr gas and by comparing the results with the well known resonance features @xcite at energies between about 60  ev and 120 ev .",
    "calibrated monochromator settings from these ranges were linearly interpolated to obtain the scaling factors for measured energies in the present range of interest .",
    "since the parent ions are in motion , a doppler correction has to be carried out transforming the nominal laboratory energies to the center of mass frame of the ions before applying the calibration factor .",
    "with all this carefully included , we estimate an absolute uncertainty of at most @xmath43  mev for the energy scale of the present measurements , at some energies close to the calibration energies the absolute uncertainties are as small as @xmath44  mev . since the precision of peak position determinations is of the order of only 0.1  mev , the possible calibration error almost exclusively determines the absolute uncertainties of the resonance energies .",
    "relative uncertainties of resonance energies within the range of one scan measurement are very much smaller than @xmath43  mev . especially in scan ranges of only about 2 to 3 hundred mev",
    "the relative uncertainties of peak positions are only about 0.1  mev .",
    "the results of the present work are described in detail in the following subsections for each of the be - like ions investigated .",
    "theoretical cross sections were calculated separately for each of the initial ( 1s@xmath122s@xmath12  @xmath3s@xmath45 ) , ( 1s@xmath122s2p  @xmath4p@xmath6 ) , ( 1s@xmath122s2p  @xmath4p@xmath7 ) and ( 1s@xmath122s2p  @xmath4p@xmath8 ) states of the be - like c@xmath0 , n@xmath1 , and o@xmath2 parent ions .",
    "the calculated unconvoluted cross sections show very rich details with numerous resonances of very different widths . in order to assess the strengths contained in these features it is convenient to convolute the calculated cross sections with a gaussian distribution of defined width .",
    "the convoluted spectra provide an immediate overview over the relative importance of the different resonance contributions .",
    "for comparison with experiments such convolution has to be carried out anyway in order to simulate the limited experimental energy resolution .    in the experiments all the above initial states were present in the parent ion beams used for the measurements .",
    "the ecr ion source has to provide electron energies sufficiently high to produce the desired multiply charged ions .",
    "hence , population of the metastable @xmath4p@xmath5 states with excitation energies of 6.50  ev for c@xmath0 , 8.34  ev for n@xmath1 , and 10.19  ev for o@xmath2 ions @xcite was unavoidable .",
    "moreover , the lifetimes of the @xmath4p@xmath5 states of the investigated ions are at least about 470  @xmath17s ( for o@xmath2(1s@xmath122s2p  @xmath4p@xmath7 )  @xcite while the time of flight between the ion source and the photon - ion interaction region is at most 8  @xmath17s",
    ". therefore ions in these metastable states constituted part of the primary ion beam .",
    "comparison of the theoretical cross sections with the measured ( apparent ) cross sections indicates a fractional content @xmath46 of metastable @xmath4p@xmath5 states in the parent ion beams with @xmath47 while the fraction of ground state @xmath3s ions is @xmath48 .",
    "the individual numbers found in each experiment will be discussed in the appropriate subsections .",
    "the energy spacings between the 3 individual fine - structure states within the @xmath4p@xmath5 manifolds are very small as compared to the excitation energies .",
    "the splitting between the energetically lowest state , @xmath4p@xmath6 , and the highest , @xmath4p@xmath8 , is only 9.9  mev for c@xmath0 , 25.7  mev for n@xmath1 , and 54.9  mev for o@xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of energy splitting versus excitation energy is the largest for the o@xmath2 ions where it amounts to not more than 0.0054 .",
    "statistical population of the fine structure states therefore appears to be a good assumption , i.e. , 1/9 of @xmath46 is in the @xmath4p@xmath6 state , 3/9 are in the @xmath4p@xmath7 state , and 5/9 of @xmath46 are in the @xmath4p@xmath8 state .",
    "the present comparisons of theory and experiment fully support this assumption . in our previous work on photoionization of the b@xmath10 ion @xcite",
    "the assumption of an overall population of metastable states was @xmath49 and all of that in the @xmath4p@xmath7 state gave the best result for a fit of the experiment with theory using the metastable fractions as fit parameters .",
    "the present analysis casts some doubt on those fractions .",
    "our first study on photoionization of be - like ions was carried out with c@xmath0 ions  @xcite .",
    "the calculations performed in that work were similar in nature to the present theory , but were carried out with an energy mesh of 1.36 mev , compared to a mesh of 13.6  @xmath17ev for the present calculations .",
    "it was discovered that such a finer mesh for the theory was needed to properly characterize the narrower resonances in be - like ions , as illustrated in subsection 4.1 .",

    "in the present study , photoionization experiments on four - electron be - like c@xmath0 , n@xmath1 and o@xmath2 ions were carried out with ion beams containing not only ions in their ( 1s@xmath122s@xmath12  @xmath3s@xmath45 ) ground state but also in the metastable ( 1s@xmath122s2p  @xmath4p@xmath6 ) , ( 1s@xmath122s2p  @xmath4p@xmath7 ) , and ( 1s@xmath122s2p  @xmath4p@xmath8 ) states .",
    "relative cross sections were obtained by scanning the photon energy and observing the ionization signal , the ion beam current and the photon flux .",
    "the relative data were normalized to published absolute measurements by mller  @xcite and by bizau @xcite . for several prominent features in the photoionization",
    "spectra the experimental energy resolution was pushed to the limit of feasibility in order to scrutinize the details of individual transitions between initial and final states and their contributions to the photoionization cross sections . resolving powers of up to 21,200",
    "were accomplished .",
    "the measurements were accompanied by state - of - the - art breit - pauli r - matrix calculations showing extremely good agreement with even the finest details revealed in the high resolution experiments . supporting calculations employing the online version of the cats los alamos national laboratory atomic physics codes package @xcite facilitated assignments of observed structures and resonances to individual transitions @xmath4p@xmath89d@xmath90 and @xmath4p@xmath89p@xmath91 with j=0,1,2 , j=1,2,3 and j=0,1,2 .",
    "the oscillator strengths @xmath55 for the most important photoexcitation processes were calculated on the same footing providing additional information about the relative strengths of individual state - to - state selective contributions to the observed resonance features in the photoionization cross sections .",
    "for such a comparison of theory and experiment , the fractions of the ground state and the long lived excited states have to be assessed .",
    "a plausible assumption about the relative fractions of the three initial metastable @xmath4p@xmath92 states is a statistical population of the fine structure states , i.e. , relative weights of 1/9 : 3/9 : 5/9 for total angular momenta j=0,1,2 , respectively .",
    "the ratio of metastable ( @xmath46 ) versus ground state ( @xmath93 ) ion components in the primary ion beam was found to be about @xmath46 : @xmath93 = 0.5 : 0.5 with possible excursions of that ratio from 0.4 : 0.6 to 0.6 : 0.4 .",
    "while the detailed comparisons of theory and experiment always support statistical population within the @xmath4p@xmath92 manifold , the fractions @xmath46 could not be determined equally well because of the uncertainties of the absolute experimental cross sections .",
    "considering the related limitations of the experimental data , the agreement between theory and the high resolution experiments even in finest details of the cross section functions is truely remarkable . evidently , the present state - of - the - art breit - pauli r - matrix approach is very well suitable for providing excellent predictions of photoionization cross sections for be - like ions in low charge states even at the level of state - to - state resolved data .",
