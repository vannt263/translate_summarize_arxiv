    "the international effort to emulate the behavior of correlated electrons in solids using ultracold atomic systems @xcite is by now a familiar topic .",
    "experimental progress has been rapid , and the mott insulating state of fermionic atoms in a 3d cubic optical lattice has been observed @xcite . however , to explore the key open questions about the hubbard model  for example , how similar its phase diagram really is to that of the high - temperature superconductors @xcite  it is necessary to achieve a significantly lower entropy per particle than at present . to be quantitative , the entropy per particle must drop below @xmath0 ; this is the scale at which antiferromagnetic correlations begin to set in .",
    "the role of theory in recent work on this problem has been vital .",
    "on the one hand , experimental work is being conducted to help elucidate the properties of the hubbard model at low temperatures . on the other ,",
    "the interpretation of the data taken in experiments often depends heavily on the theoretical understanding of the hubbard model itself .",
    "for example , one experiment @xcite measured the density profile of the cloud under varying amounts of harmonic confinement ; the mott insulator was identified by close comparison with theoretical predictions of the same . in more recent experiments",
    "@xcite , measurements of the fraction of doubly occupied sites in the optical lattice , @xmath1 , were compared with theory to show that these experiments are still dominated by thermal ( rather than quantum ) fluctuations , a topic we take up below .    as well as being relevant for interpretation of measurements on ultracold atomic systems , good theoretical understanding is crucial for the development of experimental cooling protocols . here also the behavior of the double - occupancy fraction as a function of temperature is important , as it has a direct relation to the entropic properties of the system .",
    "for example , the pomeranchuk - like cooling method outlined in @xcite relies on an entropy enhancement , observable as a surprising suppression of double occupancy at intermediate temperatures . whether this effect is strong enough to be useful is thus a key question ; recent numerical calculations tackling this issue in 3d lattices @xcite are suggestive but results in 2d lattices @xcite are mixed .",
    "highly accurate theoretical methods will be needed at low temperatures .",
    "motivated by these requirements  interpretation of data and design of cooling protocols  we address in this work the following two questions .",
    "first , how good is the double occupancy as a probe of the temperature ? and second , under what circumstances do we see the suppression of double occupancy at intermediate temperatures required for the adiabatic cooling protocol of ref .",
    "we construct an accurate theoretical framework for treating low temperature fermions in one dimension .",
    "we shall find that , in a 1d optical lattice , @xmath2 is a non - monotonic function of temperature . from the point of view of temperature measurement , this is a disadvantage ; on the other hand , the resulting double - occupancy suppression indicates a large entropy enhancement , offering a clear route to adiabatic cooling .",
    "we shall argue that the enhancement of double occupancy occurs for different reasons in different temperature regimes :  it is driven by thermal fluctuations at high temperatures , but by quantum fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "we thus interpret the suppression in double occupancy at intermediate temperatures as occurring because the system is  loosely speaking  too hot for quantum coherence , but too cold for significant thermal excitation of double occupancy .",
    "finally , we shall show that these local effects can be measured quantitatively with a bulk observable even in the presence of realistic harmonic confinement .",
    "our method combines zero - temperature bethe ansatz ( ba ) studies with finite - temperature series expansions .",
    "recent implementations of ba @xcite compute observables such as the core compressibility @xcite . here",
    ", however we show that double occupancy alone indicates a large entropy enhancement , even though the 1d system is not a fermi liquid . by focusing on 1d hubbard physics",
    "we demonstrate that exact calculations over the entire temperature range can be used as a platform to guide experiments in the construction of low temperature quantum states in optical lattice emulators .",
    "we consider the hubbard model of cold fermionic atoms in a one - dimensional optical lattice : @xmath3 the indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 are integers labeling the sites of the lattice ; the index @xmath6 labels two different hyperfine states of the @xmath7 atoms in question , and we take both of these states to have equal total populations @xmath8 .",
    "the operator @xmath9 annihilates a fermion of species @xmath10 on site @xmath5 ; the number operator @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 .    the first term in ( [ hubbard ] ) represents the quantum tunneling of atoms between neighboring sites of the lattice ; the second the repulsion due to @xmath13-wave scattering when two atoms are present on the same site ; and the third the single - atom site energy .",
    "this last term may be site - dependent ; for example , if the system were confined to a ` box ' of length @xmath14 we would have @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 otherwise . in the more realistic case of harmonic trapping",
    ", it would be given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lattice spacing and @xmath20 is a length scale related to the curvature of the trap .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath21 depends on the depth of the optical lattice ; the on - site repulsion @xmath22 on the @xmath13-wave scattering length , which is tunable via feshbach - resonance methods ; and the on - site energies @xmath23 on the shape and amplitude of the trapping potential .    .",
    "the dashed line indicates the low-@xmath24 expansion ( [ doublelowt ] ) ; the solid line is the fourth - order high-@xmath24 expansion ; the dot - dashed line is the exact result for a two - site hubbard model in the grand canonical ensemble ; and the dotted line is the same but with the number of particles set to exactly two . at low @xmath24 ,",
    "non - zero @xmath1 arises from coherent quantum fluctuations , but at intermediate temperatures this coherence is destroyed , leading to a suppression of @xmath2 shown by the double - headed arrow.,width=288 ]",
    "we begin our analysis with an analytic study of the zero temperature double occupancy in the bulk limit ( obtained by assuming a ` box ' potential as defined above and taking the thermodynamic limit @xmath25 , @xmath26 constant ) at half filling ( @xmath27 ) .",
