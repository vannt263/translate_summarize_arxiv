    "our knowledge of the transition form factors in the antineutrino induced quasielastic process of hyperon production ( @xmath6 ) is far from satisfactory . recently , with the development of high intensity ( anti)neutrino beams in the few gev region , considerable interest has developed in understanding these weak transition form factors specially in the axial vector sector .",
    "these form factors have been determined experimentally and theoretically using cabibbo theory assuming su(3 ) symmetry and other symmetries of weak hadronic currents in the standard model .",
    "most of these form factors are determined from the analysis of semileptonic decay of hyperons and neutron which are limited to very low momentum transfer .",
    "these form factors are found to be consistent with su(3 ) symmetry which relates them to the form factors in @xmath7 sector of ( anti)neutrino  nucleon scattering and to the various couplings in semileptonic hyperon decays . however , the status of g  invariance , conservation of vector current(cvc ) , partial conservation of axial current(pcac ) , etc . which seem to work quite well in the nucleon sector",
    "are not well understood when extended to octet of baryons using su(3 ) symmetry which is known to be an approximate symmetry .",
    "even though , the vast amount of data available on semileptonic decay of hyperons is consistent with the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry , the violation of g  invariance and su(3 ) symmetry is not ruled out  @xcite .",
    "there is no unambiguous way to implement su(3 ) symmetry as far as cvc and pcac are concerned but the prescriptions which have been used in literature to implement the symmetry , seem to work well  @xcite .    the charged current quasielastic production of hyperons by antineutrinos ( charged current quasielastic production induced by neutrinos is prohibited by @xmath8 rule while any neutral current production induced by @xmath5 and @xmath9 is prohibited by the absence of flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) in the standard model ) is the most appropriate place to study the nucleon - hyperon transition form factors which enables us to extend the study of form factors to higher @xmath10 beyond the @xmath10 values accessible in semileptonic hyperon decays .",
    "there are some experimental studies performed to determine these form factors from the cross section measurements done for these processes at cern  @xcite , bnl  @xcite , fnal  @xcite and serpukhov  @xcite which are limited by low statistics .",
    "theoretically , these reactions have been studied for more than 50 years  @xcite but recently there has been renewed interest in studying these reactions  @xcite due to the feasibility of doing experiments with the availability of high intensity antineutrino beams  @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical calculations have been done only for the production cross section but there exist some calculations also for the polarization of the produced hyperons  @xcite .",
    "there is only one experiment done at cern which has reported the results for the polarization observables for @xmath0 hyperon produced in the quasielastic @xmath11 reaction  @xcite .    experimentally , there is now possibility to study the production cross section of hyperons and other strange particles as well as polarization of hyperons at present facilities at fermi lab  @xcite and j - parc  @xcite where high intensity beams of ( anti)neutrino are available",
    ". the experiments planned with liquid argon tpc ( lartpc ) detectors at microboone  @xcite and argoneut  @xcite , and the proposed dune  @xcite experiment at fermi lab will be able to see charged hadrons in coincidence , thus making it possible to measure polarization in addition to the cross section measurements being done at miner@xmath5a  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , most appropriate time to theoretically perform the calculations for the polarization observables in the standard model using cabibbo theory and/or quark models , using the present state of knowledge about the symmetry of weak hadronic currents and the properties of transition form factors associated with the matrix element between the hadronic states .",
    "this will facilitate the analysis of experimental results when they become available .",
    "we propose to study theoretically the production and polarization of hyperons produced in the following reactions : @xmath12 using cabibbo theory in the standard model with gim mechanism for extension to strangeness sector .",
