    "it has been widely accepted that more than 80% of matter in the universe is dark matter ( dm ) , most of which believed to be non - baryonic , possibly weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) .",
    "compelling evidences for dm include observations of the flatness of galactic rotation curves , measurements of the cosmic microwave background and baryon - acoustic oscillations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) . nevertheless , the properties of dm particles , including their spin , mass and interactions , are still largely unknown .",
    "the effects of various dm candidates on stellar evolution and structure have been discussed in the literature .",
    "it is hoped that constraints on the properties of dm particles may be obtained from observations of stellar objects such as the sun or compact stars .",
    "such studies can be divided into two classes : non - self - annihilating dm and self - annihilating dm .",
    "self - annihilating dm affects a star by supplying energy through their annihilations into photons .",
    "the role of dm in the first generation stars as stellar seeds , together with the possibility of dm annihilation as the energy source in the first phase of stellar evolution are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the dm annihilation energy might provide sufficient pressure to delay the star from entering the main - sequence stage .",
    "also , the main - sequence lifetime can be extended @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the dm self - annihilation energy may broaden the path in the h - r diagram . by considering dm self - annihilation in the sun ,",
    "authors of @xcite suggest that solar neutrino flux and helioseismology data can be used to constrain dm particle properties . in compact stars ,",
    "dm annihilation becomes the only heat - generation mechanism , and their cooling curves or luminosity may be altered @xcite , which may in turn provide information on the dm properties , scattering cross - sections , as well as local dm distributions . on the other hand , it has also been suggested that self - annihilating neutralino dm stars can not exist @xcite .",
    "non - self - annihilating dm affects a star through its gravity by accumulating in the stellar core , or through its cooling of stellar materials by scattering with ordinary particles . in @xcite",
    "it is suggested that the cooling by dm scattering may increase the minimum mass for hydrogen - burning stars and a longer main - sequence lifetime .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that the solar composition problem may be solved by admixing non - self - annihilating dm .",
    "the changes in the orbits of stellar objects due to the increase of stellar mass from accreted dm are studied in @xcite .",
    "convection zone profile may also be changed , bringing impact on the helium flash @xcite .",
    "similar studies are applied to compact stars .",
    "the first study is pioneered in 1989 by goldman and nussinov @xcite , which sets a limit on dm particle mass and scattering cross - section by considering very old compact stars .",
    "the idea of using compact stars to probe the dm particle properties is further elaborated in @xcite .",
    "limits on the mass and scattering cross - sections for different classes of dm , such as bosonic and fermionic dm with different scattering channels , are derived from compact star observations @xcite . in @xcite , models of non - self - annihilating dm , including asymmetric dark matter and mirror matter , are examined .",
    "it is found that a more compact neutron star is resulted when a dm core is included .",
    "the gravity from the accumulated dm might even be strong enough to trigger a phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter inside the star and produce a gamma - ray burst @xcite .    in our previous work @xcite , we considered non - self - annihilating dm particles of mass @xmath3 gev to study the equilibrium structure and radial oscillations of dm admixed neutron stars using a general relativistic two - fluid formulation .",
    "in particular , we found a new class of compact stars which consists of a small normal matter ( nm ) core with radius of a few kilometers embedded in a ten - kilometer sized dm halo . here",
    "nm refers to ordinary particles in the standard model .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our investigation by employing the two - fluid formulation to study white dwarfs ( wd ) with dm cores .",
    "we shall in general refer to these stellar models as hybrid white dwarfs ( hwd ) in the following . the impact of annihilating dm on the cooling of traditional wd is well studied @xcite .",
    "however , the study of non - self - annihilating dm on the structure of wd is a relatively unexplored area .",
    "a recent study using bosonic condensate dm can be found in @xcite .",
    "if the mass and/or radius of traditional wd near the chandrasekhar limit are altered significantly due to the presence of dm cores , the initial conditions of type ia supernova explosions would be affected , making it doubtful whether they can still be regarded as standard candles - a key assumption in the discovery of dark energy .    in this work , we shall study the equilibrium structure of hwd by assuming that the dm particles are non - self - annihilating fermionic particles with particle mass @xmath4 ranging from 1 to 100 gev .",
    "the mass range is chosen based on two reasons .",
    "first , the most popular dm candidate , wimp , is expected to have a mass of the order 100 gev . _ second , data from the dama , cogent , and cresst experiments @xcite are consistent with detecting light dm particles with a few gev , though the results are in conflict with the null results reported by cdms and xenon @xcite .",
    "more recently , the cdms - ii collaboration has also reported signals that are consistent with dm particles with mass @xmath5 gev @xcite .",
    "_    the major difference between our current work and our previous work @xcite lies in the nm equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the pressure inside a hwd is due mainly to a degenerate electron gas instead of nuclear matter .",
    "apart from the eos , the typical length scales of nm and dm in a hwd differ by many orders of magnitude .",
    "as we shall see below , for dm particles with mass 100 gev , the typical size of a dm core can be smaller than the radius of the whole star by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly outline the formulation for constructing hwd . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we study the structure of hwd for different dm particle masses in detail . sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] summarizes our results and discusses possible future investigation .",
    "finally , appendix  [ sec : appendix ] discusses briefly the radial oscillation modes of hwd .",
    "appendix b discusses how our proposed hwd might be formed .",
    "we use units where @xmath7 unless otherwise noted .",
    "in our previous work @xcite , we study the structure and oscillations of dm admixed neutron stars using a general relativistic two - fluid formalism . here we adopt the formulation to study hwd with dm cores .",
    "the essential structure equations and numerical technique for constructing a two - fluid star can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the full derivations ) .",
    "here we only outline the essential equations .    for a static and spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath8 ,",
    "the structure equations for a two - fluid compact star are given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number densities of nm and dm , respectively .",
    "the primes refer to derivatives with respect to @xmath12 , and the coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are functions of the master function @xmath19 , which is the negative of the thermodynamics energy density .",
    "the generalized pressure @xmath20 is calculated from the master function @xmath19 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the explicit expressions .    in the two - fluid formalism , the master function @xmath19 plays the role of the eos information needed in the structure calculation . in this work",
    ", we assume that dm couples with nm only through gravity .",
    "hence , the master function is separable in the sense that @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the negative of energy densities of nm and dm , respectively .    to model the nm , we choose the akmal - pandharipande - ravenhall eos @xcite to describe the high - density nuclear matter . as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we need to model matter in the nuclear density range ( @xmath24 ) because the nm in the core of a hwd can indeed reach this density range . at lower densities",
    "we use the sly4 @xcite and baym - pethick - sutherland eos @xcite . on the other hand , we consider degenerate ideal fermi gas eos for dm .",
    "we shall consider dm in the mass range from 1 gev to 100 gev .",
    "in this section , we study the stellar properties of hwd with different dm core masses @xmath25 and particle mass @xmath26 . before presenting our results in detail ,",
    "let us first give a brief summary of our finding .",
    "since the dm core is described by an ideal fermi gas , and it is well known that the maximum stable mass of a self - gravitating fermi gas depends on the particle mass @xmath26 , thus the maximum amount of dm that can exist inside a stable hwd is determined by @xmath26 . as we shall see below , a stable hwd can only have a tiny dm core ( @xmath27 ) if the core is composed of massive dm particles with @xmath28 gev .",
    "if the mass of the dm core increases beyond the maximum stable limit , the whole star would collapse promptly to a black hole . on the other hand , for low - mass dm particle @xmath29 gev , the dm core can reach the level @xmath30 and affect the structure of the star significantly .",
    "the relation between @xmath26 and the maximum dm core mass can be obtained from the energy argument of landau ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , from which we have the scaling relation @xmath31 . for @xmath32 gev ,",
    "the dm core becomes so small in spatial size that it is difficult to be resolved .",
    "however , extrapolating our results to @xmath32 gev , we expect almost no change to the mass - radius relation .      here",
    "we study the mass - radius relation of hwd composed of dm with different particle mass @xmath26 ranging from 1 gev to 100 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr100 ] , we plot the mass - radius relations of hwd with dm core formed by @xmath33 gev dm particles .",
    "results for three different dm core mass @xmath34 are plotted together with the case without dm . for these massive dm particles",
    ", we find that hwd models can not be constructed with @xmath35 , the value of which is set by the maximum mass limit of a self - gravitating degenerate fermi gas .",
    "it should be noted that the mass of the nm fluid inside the dm core also decreases the stability of the dm core .",
    "the total masses of these hwd models are dominated by the nm fluid , and hence the dm cores have negligible effects on the stellar structures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr100 ] .",
    "decreasing the dm particle mass can increase the maximum stable mass limit of the degenerate dm cores inside hwd .",
    "one may thus expect to see a significant difference between hwd and traditional wd models in the low @xmath26 regime .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr10 ] , we show the mass - radius relation of hwd for @xmath36 gev . we see that the maximum stable mass of the dm core increases to about @xmath37 , beyond which no hwd model can be constructed . although the dm core can now be more massive than that in the case of @xmath38 gev , it is still not large enough to change the mass - radius relation significantly .",
    "in particular , the dm core has little effect on the chandrasekhar mass limit of wd .",
    "hence , for non - self - annihilating massive dm particles , we conclude that stable hwd can only have tiny dm cores ( @xmath39 ) . as a result ,",
    "the global properties of these stellar models are very similar to traditional wd .    .",
    "the dm particle mass is @xmath33 gev .",
    "we choose @xmath25 up to the value @xmath40 , beyond which no stable dm core can exist .",

    "we plot the corresponding mass - radius relation in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr1 ] .",
    "the maximum stable mass limit of the dm core is @xmath43 in this case .",
    "in contrast to the previous cases @xmath36 and 100 gev , we now see that the mass - radius relation of hwd depends sensitively on @xmath25 . in particular",
    ", the chandrasekhar mass limit decreases from about @xmath44 to @xmath45 as @xmath25 increases from 0 to @xmath46 .",
    "however , the radius of the stellar model corresponding to the chandrasekhar mass limit does not depend sensitively on @xmath25 .",
    "it should be noted that while both fluids contribute to the gravitational potential , the pressure of each fluid does not support the other one .",
    "therefore , extra pressure gradient is needed for one fluid to balance the extra gravitational force exerted by the other fluid .",
    "however , because the dm core is much more compact than the nm , a slight increase in @xmath25 results in a large gravitational attraction in the core and induces the collapse of the chandrasekhar - mass model . in order to achieve a new stable equilibrium model , the hwd should have a much lower @xmath47 .",
    "note that the total mass of a hwd is dominated by the nm , thus the chandrasekhar mass drops significantly with a slight increment in @xmath25 . on the contrary",
    ", the radius of the chandrasekhar - mass model displays a mild change . along the sequence of chandrasekhar - mass models ,",
    "the increase in @xmath25 leads to a smaller radius because of a stronger gravitational attraction . on the other hand ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath47 makes a hwd larger . as these factors partially cancel each other , the radius of the chandrasekhar - mass model is thus insensitive to @xmath25 .",
    "one may also notice that , for a given total mass @xmath48 , the radius of the star decreases significantly as the amount of dm increases .",
    "[ fig : mr1 ] shows that the radius of a 0.6 @xmath49 traditional wd without dm is about 6600 km . due to the strong gravity of the dm core",
    ", a hwd with the same total mass and @xmath43 has a radius of 2800 km only . for comparison ,",
    "the radius of the moon is about 1700 km , whereas the largest satellite in the solar system , ganymede , has a radius of about 2600 km .    , but for @xmath42 gev.,width=302,height=226 ]      since dm and nm are assumed to couple with each other only through gravity in our calculations , the nm is supported by its own pressure against gravitational attraction , which is sourced by both fluids .",
    "therefore , comparing to traditional wd models without dm , the presence of a dm core in a hwd can provide extra gravitational attraction to squeeze the nm in the core region to a higher density .",
    "it is known that the global structure of a traditional wd is determined by the eos below neutron drip ( @xmath50 ) , while that of a neutron star is determined mainly by the eos near or above nuclear density ( @xmath51 ) . in the domain between @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,",
    "the nuclei become more neutron rich and the electron gas degeneracy pressure drops significantly as the density increases . as a result",

    "the vertical line at a lower density divides the stable ( labeled as wd ) and unstable branches of traditional wd models , while the other vertical line at a higher density marks the onset of the stable branch of neutron stars ( labeled as ns ) .",

    "it should be noted that despite the difference in the density profiles in the core regions of the hwd and traditional wd models in fig .",

    "the properties of nm in the inner cores of these hwd are very different from those of traditional wd which have typical central densities below neutron drip . however , from the observational point of view , these hwd and traditional wd models could be indistinguishable because their global properties are essentially the same .    in our view , the more interesting result in our study is obtained from the case of low - mass dm particles with @xmath66 gev .",
    "the dm core of a hwd in this case can reach the level @xmath30 and affect the structure of the star significantly",

    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that compact wds are formed by other mechanisms , such as with the help of a strange matter core @xcite .",
    "finally , let us remark that as the chandrasekhar mass limit of hwd formed by 1-gev scale dm particles depends sensitively on @xmath34 , the initial conditions of type ia supernovae might not be as universal as generally assumed , making it doubtful to what extent type ia supernovae can be regarded as standard candles - a key assumption in the discovery of dark energy .",

    "in @xcite we studied the radial oscillation modes of dm admixed neutron stars and found a new class of modes which are characterized mainly by the oscillations of dm fluid .",
