    "scalar field , associated with spin-@xmath0 particles in quantum field theory , has been an object of great interest for physicists in the latest years .",
    "one of the main reasons is that the models with scalar fields are relatively simple , which allows us to probe the detailed features of the more complicated physical system . in cosmology ,",
    "scalar fields can be considered as candidate to explain the inflation of the early universe @xcite and the accelerated expansion of the current universe @xcite . in the standard model of particle physics",
    ", the scalar field presents as the higgs boson @xcite , which would help to explain the origin of mass in the universe .",
    "moreover , it has been found that scalar field plays the important roles in other fundamental physical theories , such as , jordan - brans - dicke theory @xcite , kaluza - klein compactification theory @xcite and superstring theory @xcite , and so on .",
    "in general , the action contained scalar fields in einstein s theory of gravity is @xmath1+s_m,\\label{act1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are corresponding to scalar field , ricci scalar and scalar potential , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath5 represents the coupling between ricci scalar @xmath3 and the scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the scalar field in the theory ( [ act1 ] ) have been investigated very extensively in the modern physics including cosmology and black hole physics .",
    "the more general form of the action contained scalar field in other theories of gravity is @xmath6+s_m,\\label{act2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are arbitrary functions of the corresponding variables .",
    "obviously , the more coupling between scalar field and curvature are considered in these extensive theories .",
    "the non - minimal coupling between the derivative of scalar field and the spacetime curvature may appear firstly in some kaluza - klein theories @xcite .",
    "amendola @xcite considered the most general theory of gravity with the lagrangian linear in the ricci scalar , quadratic in @xmath2 , in which the coupling terms have the forms as follows @xmath9 and then he studied the dynamical evolution of the scalar field in the cosmology by considering only the derivative coupling term @xmath10 and obtained some analytical inflationary solutions @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated a more general model of containing coupling terms @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and found that the de sitter spacetime is an attractor solution in the model .",
    "recently , daniel and caldwell @xcite obtained the constraints on the theory with the derivative coupling term of @xmath10 by solar system tests .",
    "in general , a theory with derivative couplings could lead to that both the einstein equations and the equation of motion for the scalar are the fourth - order differential equations .",
    "however , sushkov @xcite studied recently the model in which the kinetic term of the scalar field only coupled with the einstein tensor and found that the equation of motion for the scalar field can be reduced to second - order differential equation .",
    "this means that the theory is a  good \" dynamical theory from the point of view of physics .",
    "gao @xcite investigated the cosmic evolution of a scalar field with the kinetic term coupling to more than one einstein tensors and found the scalar field presents some very interesting characters .",
    "he found that the scalar field behaves exactly as the pressureless matter if the kinetic term is coupled to one einstein tensor and acts nearly as a dynamic cosmological constant if it couples with more than one einstein tensors .",
    "the similar investigations have been considered in refs.@xcite .",
    "these results will excite more efforts to be focused on the study of the scalar field coupled with tensors in the more general cases .",
    "since black hole is another fascinating object in modern physics , it is of interest to extend the study of the properties of the scalar field when it is kinetically coupled to the einstein tensors in the background of a black hole . in this letter",
    ", we will investigate the greybody factor and hawking radiation of the scalar field coupling only to the einstein tensor @xmath12 in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime by using the matching technique , which has been widely used in evaluating the absorption probabilities and hawking radiations of various black holes @xcite .",
    "we find that the presence of the coupling terms enhances both the absorption probability and hawking radiation of the scalar field in the black hole spacetime .",
    "moreover , we also find that for the stronger coupling , the absorption probability and hawking radiation of the scalar field increase with the charge of the black hole , which is different from those of scalar one without coupling to einstein s tensor .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in the following section we will introduce the action of a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor and derive its master equation in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime . in sec.iii",
    ", we obtain the expression of the absorption probability in the low - energy limit by using the matching technique . in section iv",
    ", we will calculate the absorption probability and the luminosity of hawking radiation for the coupled scalar field .",
    "finally , in the last section we will include our conclusions .",
    "let us consider the action of the scalar field coupling to the einstein s tensor @xmath12 in the curved spacetime @xcite , @xmath13.\\label{acts}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coupling between einstein s tensor @xmath12 and the scalar field @xmath2 is represented by the term @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is coupling constant with dimensions of length - squared . in general , the presence of such a coupling term brings some effects to the original metric of the background .",
    "however , it is very difficult for us to obtain an analytic solution for the action ( [ acts ] ) . actually , comparing with the mass of the black hole",
    ", one can find that the energy of a scalar field is very tiny so that its back - reaction effects on the background can be neglected exactly . here , we treat the weak external scalar filed as a probe field , and then study the effects of the coupling constant @xmath15 on the greybody factor and hawking radiation of the scalar filed in the background of a black hole spacetime .    varying the action with respect to @xmath2 ,",
    "one can obtain the modified klein - gordon equation @xmath16 = 0,\\label{we}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a second order differential equation .",
    "obviously , all the components of the tensor @xmath12 vanish in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime because it is the vacuum solution of the einstein s field equation .",
    "thus , we can not probe the effect of the coupling term on the greybody factor and hawking radiation in the background of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the simplest black hole with the non - zero components of the tensor @xmath12 is reissner - nordstrm one , which can be described by the metric as follows @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass and @xmath20 is the charge of the black hole .",
    "the einstein s tensor @xmath12 for the metric ( [ m1 ] ) has a form @xmath21 adopting to the spherical harmonics @xmath22 , we find that the equation ( [ we ] ) can be separable and the radial function @xmath23 obeys to @xmath24 + \\bigg[\\bigg(1+\\frac{\\eta q^2}{r^4}\\bigg)\\frac{\\omega^2}{f}-\\bigg(1-\\frac{\\eta q^2}{r^4}\\bigg)\\frac{e_{lm}}{r^2}\\bigg]r(r)=0,\\label{radial}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the eigenvalues coming from the angular equation .",
    "clearly , the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) contains the coupling constant @xmath15 , which means that the presence of the coupling term will change the evolution of the scalar field in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime .",
    "moveover , as the charge @xmath20 vanishes , it is easy to obtain that the effects of the coupling constant @xmath15 disappears and the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) reduces to that in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime .    the solution of the radial function @xmath23 will help us to obtain the absorption probability @xmath26 and the luminosity of hawking radiation for a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime .",
    "in this section , we will present an analytic expressions for the greybody factors for the emission of a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime .",
    "since the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) is generally nonlinear , it is very difficult to obtain its analytic solution .",
    "however , following refs.@xcite , we can provide an approximated solution of the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) by employing the matching technique .",
    "firstly , we can derive the analytic solutions in the near horizon ( @xmath27 ) and far - field @xmath28 regimes in the low - energy limit ( i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , respectively .",
    "then , we can match smoothly these two radial functions @xmath23 in an intermediate region since the wave function in physics is continuous everywhere . through this matching technique",
    "we can construct a smooth analytical solution of the radial equation valid throughout the entire spacetime and extract further the ratio between two coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ rf6 ] ) , which helps us define the greybody factor .",
    "the main reason that we here adopt to the low - energy approximation is that in this limit we can neglect the back - reaction of a scalar field to the background metric during the emission process .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the greybody factor modifies the spectrum of emitted particles from that of a perfect thermal blackbody . however , in the high - energy regime , the greybody factor is independent of the energy @xmath33 of the particle and the spectrum is exactly like that of a perfect blackbody for every particle species @xcite , while in the low - energy regime , it encodes information about the near horizon structure of a black hole and about the particles emitted by the black hole .",
    "now , we focus on the near - horizon regime and perform the following transformation of the radial variable as in refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 the equation ( [ radial ] ) near the horizon @xmath36 can be rewritten as @xmath37r(f)=0,\\label{r1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 making the field redefinition @xmath39 , one can find that the equation ( [ r1 ] ) can be rewritten as a form of the hypergeometric equation @xmath40\\frac{d f(f)}{d f}-ab f(f)=0,\\label{r2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 considering the constraint coming from coefficient of @xmath42 , one can easy to obtain that the power coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 satisfy @xmath45 and @xmath46=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "these two equations admit that the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 have the forms @xmath47 } \\;\\bigg\\},\\label{bet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following the operation in ref.@xcite and using the boundary condition that no outgoing mode exists near the horizon , we can obtain that the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus the asymptotic solution near horizon has the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "let us now to stretch smoothly the near horizon solution to the intermediate zone . as done in ref.@xcite ,",
    "we can make use of the property of the hypergeometric function @xcite and change its argument in the near horizon solution from @xmath7 to @xmath52 @xmath53.\\label{r2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath54 , the function @xmath55 can be approximated as @xmath56 and then the near horizon solution ( [ r2 ] ) can be simplified further to @xmath57 with @xmath58 @xmath59 in order to obtain a solution in the far field region , we expand the wave equation ( [ radial ] ) as a power series in @xmath60 and keep only the leading terms @xmath61 this is usual bessel equation .",
    "thus the solution of radial master equation ( [ radial ] ) in the far - field limit can be expressed as @xmath62,\\label{rf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the first and second kind bessel functions , @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 are integration constants . in order to stretch the far - field solution ( [ rf ] ) towards small radial coordinate ,",
    "we take the limit @xmath68 and obtain @xmath69 in the low - energy limit , the two power coefficients in eq.([rn2 ] ) can be approximated as @xmath70 respectively . by matching the corresponding coefficients between eqs.([rn2 ] ) and ( [ rfn2 ] ) , we can obtain two relations between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "removing @xmath73 , we can obtain the ratio between the coefficients @xmath74 @xmath75^{2l+1 } \\bigg(\\frac{2l+1}{2}\\bigg)\\gamma^2(l+\\frac{1}{2 } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\;\\frac { \\gamma(c - a - b)\\gamma(a)\\gamma(b)}{\\gamma(a+b - c)\\gamma(c - a)\\gamma(c - b)}. \\label{bb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the asymptotic region @xmath76 , the solution in the far - field can be expressed as @xmath77 the absorption probability can be calculated by @xmath78 inserting the expression of @xmath79 ( [ bb ] ) into eq.([gfa ] ) , we can probe the properties of absorption probability for the scalar field coupled with einstein s tensor in the charged black hole spacetime in the low - energy limit .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the absorption probability and discuss hawking radiation of a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor in the background of a reissner - nordstrm black hole .    in fig.1 , we fixed the coupling constant @xmath15 and plotted the change of the absorption probability of a scalar particle with the charge @xmath20 for the first partial waves ( @xmath80 ) in the reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "one can easily see that with for the smaller @xmath15 the absorption probability @xmath81 decreases with the charge @xmath20 of black hole , which is similar to that for the usual scalar field without coupling to einstein s tensor . however , for the larger @xmath15 , the absorption probability @xmath81 increases as the charge @xmath20 increase , which means that the stronger coupling between the scalar field and einstein s tensor changes the properties of the absorption probability of scalar field in the black hole spacetime . this phenomenon has not been observed elsewhere . from fig.2",
    ", we also find that the absorption probability increases with the increase of the coupling constant @xmath15 for fixed values of charge @xmath82 .",
    "these results about the absorption probability hold true for other values of @xmath83 .",
    "it is also shown in figs . 3 and 4 , in which we plotted the dependence of the absorption probability on the angular index .",
    "moreover , we see the suppression of @xmath84 as the values of the angular index increase . this can be explained by a fact that the absorption probability @xmath85 in the low - energy approximation @xmath86 @xcite , which means that the first partial wave dominates over all others in the absorption probability .",
    "it is similar to that of the scalar field without coupling to einstein s tensor as shown in refs.@xcite .",
