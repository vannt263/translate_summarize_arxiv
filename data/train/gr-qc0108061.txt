    "in this section we give an overview of the general problem , and describe what is known in the @xmath7 case .",
    "most of this material was first discussed by low ( see @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and can be found in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath0-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime with a fixed time orientation , and consider the set @xmath2 of all its null geodesics ( we define a null vector to be a _",
    "vector @xmath10 such that @xmath11 , and hence the constant geodesic is _ not _ a null geodesic ) .",
    "if @xmath12 is a cauchy surface , then every null geodesic intersects @xmath13 exactly once . on the other hand , at any event @xmath14 two future - pointing null vectors are initial conditions for the same null geodesic _",
    "iff _ they are linearly dependent , or , equivalently , _",
    "iff _ their orthogonal projections on @xmath15 are linearly dependent .",
    "consequently , @xmath2 can be identified with the tangent sphere bundle @xmath16 ( recall that @xmath13 endowed with the metric induced by @xmath17 is a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath18 ) .",
    "we use this fact to define a differentiable structure on @xmath2 , and notice that , due to smooth dependence of the solutions of the geodesic equation on its initial data , this structure is independent of the choice of cauchy surface .",
    "thus the set of all null geodesics of a globally hyperbolic @xmath0-dimensional spacetime is a differentiable manifold of dimension @xmath19 , which we call its _ manifold of light rays_.",
    "the _ sky _ of an event @xmath4 is the subset @xmath20    if @xmath14 then @xmath21 is a fibre of the tangent sphere bundle @xmath16 , and therefore is an embedded submanifold of @xmath2 diffeomorphic to @xmath6 . since we are free to regard @xmath2 as a fibre bundle over _ any _ cauchy surface , and every event in @xmath22 belongs to _ some _ cauchy surface , we see that any sky is an embedded @xmath6 .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath22 is orientable .",
    "then by choosing a global time function @xmath23 and using the globally defined nonvanishing future - pointing timelike vector field @xmath24 we can orient all cauchy surfaces @xmath25 ; hence we can define an orientation on each sky by orienting tangent spheres on each cauchy surface ( it is easy to check that this orientation does not depend on the choice of global time function ) .    if @xmath8 are not in the same null geodesic then @xmath26 is a _ smooth link _",
    ", i.e. , a disjoint union of embedded @xmath6s in a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath27 .",
    "recall that a smooth one - parameter family of diffeomorphisms @xmath28 \\times n \\to n$ ] is said to be a _",
    "smooth ( ambient ) isotopy _ if @xmath29 is the identity map .",
    "two links @xmath30 and @xmath31 are said to be _ equivalent _ if there exists a smooth isotopy @xmath28 \\times",

    "if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two pairs of non - causally related events , one can easily construct smooth curves",

    "this induces a smooth motion of @xmath30 into @xmath31 , which are therefore equivalent .",
    "we conclude that the skies of any two non - causally related events belong to the same equivalence class , which we define as the _ unlink _ in @xmath2 ( notice that although there exists a natural choice for the unlink in @xmath50 or @xmath51 , this is not the case in general for an arbitrary smooth @xmath3-dimensional manifold ) .",
    "having said that , we now focus on the case when @xmath7 and @xmath13 is diffeomorphic to a subset of @xmath52 . in this case , @xmath2 is diffeomorphic to a subset of the tangent sphere bundle of @xmath52 , which in turn is diffeomorphic to the interior of a solid torus in @xmath53 .",
    "it will prove useful to fix a particular embedding @xmath54 ( which we shall call the _ standard embedding _ ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath55 are the usual polar coordinates in @xmath52 , and @xmath56 is the coordinate in the fibres of @xmath57 corresponding to the angle with the positive @xmath58-direction , we define @xmath59    this particular embedding has the advantage of carrying the unlink in @xmath2 ( as defined above ) to the usual unlink in @xmath53 .",
    "notice that the skies of events on @xmath13 are mapped to circles of constant @xmath55 , which for convenience we call _",
    "meridians_. from now on we shall identify @xmath2 with @xmath60 .",
    "clearly a smooth motion of a smooth link in @xmath2 is a smooth motion of this link in @xmath53 , and consequently if two links are equivalent in @xmath2 they must be equivalent in @xmath53 .",
    "recall that in @xmath53 there is a well - known link invariant , namely the _ linking number_. given a link @xmath26 , this is simply the integer given by the _",
    "gauss integral _ ,    @xmath61    ( where @xmath62 are embeddings for @xmath63 ) , or , equivalently , the integer such that @xmath64 $ ] is @xmath65 times an appropriate generator of @xmath66 , depending on the orientation of @xmath67 ( see @xcite ) . in particular",
    "if @xmath26 is the unlink then @xmath68 .",
    "notice also that , as is easily seen from the gauss integral formula , @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath8 be two events not in the same null geodesic .",
    "recall we can always assume that @xmath70 , i.e. , that @xmath67 is a meridian . in general",
    ", however , @xmath71 .",
    "since we can think of @xmath2 as @xmath16 , we have a natural smooth projection @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , @xmath73 is the intersection of the light cone of @xmath74 with @xmath13 , and is a piecewise smooth closed curve not containing @xmath75 ; we call this the _ wavefront _ generated by @xmath74 at @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath21 is an oriented curve , @xmath73 can be given the induced orientation .",
    "we can think of @xmath76 as quotienting @xmath2 by its meridians , and consequently we can identify @xmath13 with the quotient space .",
    "thus any smooth surface on @xmath2 intersecting each meridian exactly once can be identified with @xmath13 . in this manner we can think of @xmath75 and @xmath73 as a point and a curve on @xmath77 .",
    "one can always choose @xmath77 such that @xmath78 is finite .",
    "it is then possible to construct an isotopy of @xmath2 deforming @xmath21 into a curve which approaches ( with any required accuracy ) the wavefront @xmath73 plus a finite number of meridians , one hanging from each intersection of @xmath21 and @xmath13 . indeed",
    ", if @xmath56 is the angular coordinate along the meridians such that @xmath79 , one has but to consider isotopies of the form @xmath80 , where @xmath81 \\times [ 0,2 \\pi ] \\to [ 0 , 2 \\pi]$ ] is a nonnegative smooth function vanishing for @xmath82 and @xmath83 and approaching @xmath84 from below as @xmath85 . since the linking number of any two disjoint meridians is zero , we see that @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the winding number of the curve @xmath88 around the point @xmath70 ( recall that @xmath13 is diffeomorphic to a subset of @xmath52 ) .",
    "( this result plus the fact that @xmath69 allows us to make the following nontrivial observation : if @xmath89 are not in the same null geodesic and @xmath90 are arbitrary cauchy surfaces through @xmath89 then the winding number of the wavefront generated by @xmath74 at @xmath91 around @xmath75 is equal to the winding number of the wavefront generated by @xmath75 at @xmath92 around @xmath74 ) .    as an example , consider minkowski s @xmath93-dimensional spacetime , i.e. , @xmath53 endowed with the line element @xmath94 , and take hypersurfaces of constant @xmath95 as cauchy surfaces .",
    "then all wavefronts are circles , and all linking numbers are therefore either zero or one .",
    "since an event on the cauchy surface is causally related to the event generating the wavefront _ iff _ it is either inside the wavefront ( in which case the winding number is @xmath96 ) or on it , we see that two events in minkowski @xmath93-dimensional spacetime are causally related _ iff _ their skies either intersect or are linked with linking number @xmath96 .",
    "another example is provided by schwarzschild s @xmath93-dimensional static spacetime , i.e. , the region of @xmath53 given in cylindrical coordinates @xmath97 by @xmath98 endowed with the line element @xmath99 ( we ve taken the schwarzschild radius as our length unit ) .",
    "if we again take hypersurfaces of constant @xmath95 as cauchy surfaces , then it is possible to show that the wavefronts are as shown in figure [ picture ] , wrapping around the event horizon any number of times .",
    "it is then easy to see that all winding numbers are either zero or positive , and that an event in the cauchy surface not on the wavefront is causally related to the event generating the wavefront _ iff _ the winding number is positive .",
    "consequently , two events in schwarzschild @xmath93-dimensional static spacetime are causally related _ iff _ their skies either intersect or are linked with positive linking number ( but links do occur with any positive linking number ) .",
    "it is not true in general that all links formed by the skies of causally related events have nonvanishing linking number .",
    "a simple counter - example is provided by @xmath53 endowed with the line element @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is an appropriate smooth function ( equal to @xmath96 except on the circles @xmath102 or @xmath103 , where it increases radially towards the centre ) .",
    "the wavefront of the event @xmath104 on the cauchy surface @xmath105 is as depicted in figure [ picture ] , each pair of cusps corresponding to scattering by one of the circles where the metric is not flat .",
    "the appearance of the second pair of cusps allows the existence of events @xmath75 that , although clearly causally related to @xmath74 , are such that the winding number of @xmath73 around @xmath75 is zero , and consequently @xmath68 .",
    "however @xmath26 is _ not _ the unlink .",
    "to see that , we notice that the riemannian metric induced on @xmath13 is conformally related to the euclidean metric , and that we can therefore use the usual angle with the @xmath74-axis as a coordinate on @xmath16 .",
    "to decide on the value of this coordinate along the wavefront , we recall that the tangent vector @xmath106 to any null geodesic is orthogonal to the light cone of @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , the element of @xmath16 corresponding to the null geodesic is the normal vector ( on @xmath13 ) to the wavefront , oriented so that it points outwards when the wavefront is in the boundary of the causal future . using these rules",
    "one constructs the link shown in figure [ picture ] , which is the so - called _ whitehead link _ ( and famously _ not _ the unlink ) .",
    "the above examples have led low to conjecture that then @xmath8 are causally related _ iff _ @xmath9 are linked .",
    "we now proceed to prove low s conjecture for a ( large ) class of static spacetimes ( which in particular includes the above example ) .",
    "recall that a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime @xmath1 is said to be _",
    "static _ if it admits a nonvanishing timelike killing vector field @xmath107 whose orthogonal distribution is integrable .",
    "the integral submanifolds of the orthogonal distribution endowed with the induced riemannian metric are isometric riemannian manifolds ( the isometry being generated by the flow of @xmath107 ) , which we call _ space manifolds_. notice that if @xmath13 is any space manifold then the integral lines of @xmath107 provide a natural projection @xmath108 .",
    "a static @xmath93-dimensional spacetime is said to be _ regular _ if    1 .",
    "@xmath1 is globally hyperbolic and orientable ; 2 .",
    "the space manifolds are cauchy surfaces diffeomorphic to a subset of @xmath52 ;    from this point on we shall assume that @xmath1 is a regular static @xmath93-dimensional spacetime .",
    "notice that all three examples considered in the previous section are regular .",
    "any chart @xmath109 defined on a space manifold @xmath13 can be extended to a chart @xmath110 by using the parameter @xmath95 along the integral curve of @xmath107 from the point in @xmath13 with coordinates @xmath111 . in this chart",
    "we have @xmath112 .",
    "if @xmath113 are the components of the space manifold ( riemannian ) metric on the chart @xmath109 , the line element of the full spacetime manifold on the chart @xmath110 is    @xmath114    where    @xmath115    one has the following _ fermat principle _ ( see @xcite ) :    [ fermat ] let @xmath1 be a globally hyperbolic spacetime , @xmath23 a global time function , @xmath4 an event and @xmath116 a smooth timelike curve such that @xmath117 .",
    "for each future - directed null curve @xmath118 through @xmath74 and @xmath119 ( in that chronological order ) let @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the first intersection of @xmath122 and @xmath119 to the future of @xmath74 .",
    "then the null geodesics through @xmath74 and @xmath119 are the critical points of @xmath107 .",
    "any segment of null geodesic in the chart @xmath110 satisfies    @xmath123    using this plus theorem [ fermat ] ( with the integral curves of @xmath107 in the role of @xmath119 ) it is easy to prove    let @xmath1 be a regular static @xmath93-dimensional spacetime and @xmath124 a space manifold . then the projections of null geodesics on @xmath13 parametrized by the time coordinate @xmath95 are the geodesics of the riemannian metric @xmath125 on @xmath13 .    for convenience , we make the following    let @xmath1 be a regular static @xmath93-dimensional spacetime and @xmath124 a space manifold",
    ". then the riemannian metric @xmath126 on @xmath13 is called the _ light metric _ , its geodesics the _ light geodesics _ , the corresponding geodesic spheres the _ light spheres _ and the corresponding geodesic balls the _ light balls_.    clearly light spheres on a space manifold are just the wavefronts generated by various events . consequently , the light geodesics are perpendicular to the wavefronts ( both in the light and space metrics , as they are conformally related ) .",
    "this can also be seen to be a simple consequence of the fact that null geodesics are orthogonal to the null cone , as the tangent vector of the light geodesic is parallel to the orthogonal projection of the tangent vector of the null geodesic on @xmath127 .",
    "since the space manifolds are diffeomorphic to a subset of @xmath52 , we can fix global coordinates @xmath128 on any particular space manifold @xmath13 .",
    "again we set the section defined on @xmath16 by the vector field @xmath129 as the surface @xmath130 on @xmath2 , and define the ( multivalued ) coordinate @xmath56 in @xmath2 as the angle with this vector at each point ( measured in either metric ) .",
    "notice that for our purposes it is immaterial whether we use the space metric @xmath131 or the conformally - related light - metric @xmath132 in the construction of @xmath16 .",
    "for obvious simplicity reasons we shall prefer the latter .",
    "the same nondegenerate light sphere on a space manifold is the wavefront generated by exactly _ two _ events . indeed ,",
    "if the centre of the sphere is the point in @xmath133 with coordinates @xmath134 and its radius is @xmath135 , then the sphere is the wavefront generated by the events with coordinates @xmath136 in the induced chart .",
    "although the skies of these two events project down to the same wavefront on @xmath13 , they are disjoint curves in @xmath2 , as each point on the wavefront is the projection of two antipodal points in the corresponding fibre of @xmath16 ( one in each sky ) .",
    "thus any sky is completely defined by its wavefront as long as we indicate a unit normal vector on the wavefront ( it suffices to do so at a particular point of the wavefront , as the rest follows from continuity and orthogonality ) . this extra bit of information",
    "is called a _",
    "coorientation _ of the wavefront ; it can be thought of as an indication of which way the wavefront is moving .",
    "consider the event @xmath4 with coordinates @xmath137 .",
    "for convenience , let us define @xmath138 to be the event with coordinates @xmath139 , so that @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "it should be clear that an event @xmath70 is causally related to @xmath74 _ iff _ there is a null geodesic through @xmath75 and @xmath142 for some @xmath143 .",
    "consequently the set of all events in @xmath13 which are causally related to @xmath74 is the union of the light spheres with centre @xmath144 and radius @xmath143 , i.e. , is the light ball @xmath145 of radius @xmath146 and centre @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath145 can also be thought of as the union of all light geodesic segments with endpoint @xmath144 and length @xmath146 .",
    "if one gives the light spheres the obvious coorientation , or , equivalently , the light geodesics the corresponding orientation ( away from @xmath144 ) , one can lift @xmath145 onto a surface @xmath147 on @xmath148 by lifting each cooriented light sphere to the corresponding sky , or , equivalently , by lifting each point in the oriented light geodesic to its unit tangent vector .",
    "the surface @xmath149 is called the _ causality surface _ of the event @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for this name is given in the following    an event @xmath70 is causally related to @xmath74 _ iff _ @xmath150 .",
    "we ve seen that @xmath70 is causally related to @xmath74 _ iff _",
    "@xmath151    this is a fundamental step in the proof of low s conjecture , inasmuch it gives us a precise criterion to decide which skies in @xmath2 correspond to causally related events .",
    "notice that if one is given a pair of skies it is not obvious in general whether the corresponding events are causally related , even when one of the skies projects down to a point in @xmath13 , as the wavefront generated by the other event can easily be a very complicated curve .",
    "we now analyse the structure of the causality surface @xmath147 in detail .",
    "since @xmath147 can be seen as a union of skies of events in the line segment @xmath152\\right\\}$ ] and one can move from sky to sky along the lifts of light geodesics , it is easy to see that    the causality surface is a immersion of @xmath153 $ ] in @xmath2 .",
    "consequently the boundary of @xmath147 has two connected components : one is the sky of @xmath74 , and the other is the sky of @xmath144 , which is a meridian . for completeness , we identify how @xmath147 can fail to be an embedding :    if the causality surface is not embedded then it self - intersects along segments of lifts of light geodesics . the number of such self - intersection curves is finite if @xmath144 is not conjugate to itself with respect to the light metric .    if @xmath147 is not an embedded submanifold of @xmath2 , then @xmath154 for some @xmath155 , r < s$ ] ( as @xmath153 $ ] is compact ) .",
    "thus @xmath142 and @xmath156 are in the same null geodesic @xmath122 . in other words , @xmath157 is a light geodesic containing a segment of length @xmath158 which connects @xmath144 to itself .",
    "consequently , @xmath159 for @xmath160 $ ] , and @xmath147 self - intersects along a curve .",
    "finally , considering the simultaneous time evolution of the light spheres of centre @xmath144 and radii @xmath161 and @xmath162 it is easy to see that this curve is simply the lift of the segment of light geodesic given by @xmath163 .",
    "the fact that if @xmath144 is not conjugate to itself there are only finitely many self - intersection curves is a consequence of theorem [ conjugate ] .",
    "recall that @xmath147 is ruled by the lifts of all light geodesics through the point @xmath140 .",
    "each point in @xmath164 is the initial condition for one such geodesic , and since @xmath165 is a meridian it can be parametrized by the coordinate @xmath56 in @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , an immersion @xmath166 \\to n$ ] of @xmath147 is obtained by defining @xmath167 to be the unit tangent vector to the light geodesic with initial condition in @xmath165 corresponding to @xmath168 at the point a distance @xmath95 from @xmath144 along that geodesic ( in particular @xmath169 ) . also , notice that @xmath170 is the unit tangent vector to the light geodesic corresponding to the appropriate value of @xmath168 , whereas @xmath171 is the jacobi field corresponding to this family of light geodesics . since @xmath172 and @xmath173",
    ", it is therefore clear that the critical points of @xmath174 are the zeroes of @xmath175 , i.e. , the conjugate points to @xmath144 in the light metric .",
    "we now introduce some useful terminology .",
    "a vector @xmath176 is said to be _ vertical _ if @xmath177 , i.e. , if it is a multiple of @xmath178 . a vertical vector is said to point _ up _ if it is a _ positive _ multiple of @xmath178 , and to point _ down _ if it is a _ negative _ multiple of @xmath178 .",
    "a vector @xmath176 is said to be _ horizontal _ if it is orthogonal to @xmath178 ( in the usual euclidean metric of @xmath179 ) .",
    "these definitions have obvious extensions to curves and surfaces : a curve or surface will be said to be _ vertical _ at a given point if its tangent space at that point contains a nonzero vertical vector , and will be said to be _ horizontal _ at a given point if all vectors in its tangent space at that point are horizontal .",
    "thus meridians are vertical curves , whereas curves of constant @xmath56 are horizontal surfaces .    to prove low s conjecture we just have to show that for every @xmath70 such that @xmath150 and @xmath180 the link @xmath26 is not the unlink .",
    "we start by showing that we can assume @xmath181 to be finite .",
    "[ conjugate ] if there exist infinitely many light geodesics of length @xmath182 connecting @xmath183 then these points are conjugate .",
    "let @xmath184 be _ different _ initial conditions at @xmath165 for light geodesics connecting @xmath144 to @xmath75 , and @xmath185 their lengths .",
    "since @xmath186 $ ] is compact , we can assume that @xmath187 as @xmath188 ( otherwise extract a convergent subsequence ) .",
    "it is a simple consequence of the continuous dependence of geodesics on their initial conditions that the light geodesic with initial condition @xmath189 connects @xmath144 to @xmath75 , and that the light distance between @xmath144 and @xmath75 measured along this geodesic is @xmath190 .",
    "clearly we can assume @xmath191 to be on the same chart of @xmath192 .",
    "let us define @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( where @xmath195 is the usual euclidean norm in @xmath52 ) .",
    "since @xmath196 , it has at least one sublimit @xmath197 .",
    "we assume that @xmath198 was already chosen so that @xmath199 is in fact convergent .",
    "setting @xmath200 we have from lagrange s theorem that there exists @xmath201 such that @xmath202 where the partial derivatives on the right - hand side are calculated at point @xmath203 for some @xmath201 .",
    "thus at this point @xmath204 and taking the limit we get @xmath205 at point @xmath206 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath207 , and we therefore conclude that @xmath197 is in the kernel of @xmath208 at @xmath206 . consequently , @xmath144 is conjugate to @xmath209 .",
    "for every @xmath210 there exists @xmath211 such that at most finitely many light geodesics connect @xmath144 to @xmath212 .",
    "we just have to notice that the set of points in @xmath13 which are conjugate to @xmath144 has zero lebesgue measure ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "there exists @xmath213 such that @xmath214 is equivalent to @xmath26 and @xmath215 is finite .",
    "since the light sphere @xmath73 is a closed set and @xmath216 , there exists @xmath217 such that @xmath218 .",
    "any path in @xmath219\\to b_\\varepsilon(y)\\subset\\sigma$ ] with @xmath220 , @xmath221 induces a smooth motion of @xmath26 into @xmath214 .",
    "thus we just have to choose @xmath222 such that at most finitely many light geodesics connect @xmath144 to @xmath212 .",
    "therefore we shall assume @xmath181 to be finite .",
    "it is clear from the above that we can assume that @xmath75 is not conjugate to @xmath144 along any light geodesic , and hence that @xmath67 is not tangent to @xmath147 at any of the intersections .",
    "recall that @xmath147 is ruled by lifts of light geodesics and has @xmath165 and @xmath21 for boundaries .",
    "consequently , each point of @xmath21 is connected to a unique point of @xmath165 through the lift of a light geodesic . since @xmath165 is a meridian , and",
    "therefore is a much simpler curve than @xmath21 , a natural idea is to deform @xmath21 into @xmath165 using the light geodesics connecting them .",
    "each intersection of @xmath67 and @xmath147 is then an obstruction to deforming @xmath26 into @xmath223 ( which is the unlink ) in this fashion .",
    "let us assume then that @xmath150 , @xmath224 .",
    "suppose that @xmath225 is one of the intersections .",
    "then the @xmath226-_ribbon _ corresponding to this intersection is the subset @xmath227 ( for @xmath228 ) .",
    "notice that this set is a ( closed ) neighbourhood in @xmath147 of the lift of a light geodesic segment joining @xmath144 to @xmath75 .",
    "since the lifts of light geodesics can not intersect , we conclude that for @xmath226 sufficiently small the ( finitely many ) @xmath226-ribbons do not intersect .",
    "see figure [ picture2 ] for a schematic illustration in the simplest case ( minkowski spacetime ) .",
    "let @xmath229 be a disk with boundary @xmath165 not intersecting @xmath67 , so that @xmath230 is a disk with boundary @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath231 be the union of @xmath232 with all @xmath226-ribbons corresponding to all intersection points in @xmath181 .",
    "notice that @xmath230 must always have self - intersections : since the derivative of the geodesic exponential map at the origin is the identity , for small values of @xmath95 the light geodesics are close to flat metric geodesics , and hence @xmath233 must approach a circle with centre @xmath144 and radius @xmath95 ; consequently , for @xmath234 small enough , @xmath165 and @xmath235 are linked with linking number @xmath96 , and hence @xmath235 must intersect any disk spanned by @xmath165 .",
    "however , @xmath231 does nt necessarily have to self - intersect .",
    "a regular static @xmath93-dimensional spacetime @xmath1 is said to be _ hyper - regular _ if :    1 .",
    "no light geodesic is closed or self - intersects ( i.e. , all causality surfaces are embedded ) ; 2 .",
    "for any two causally related points @xmath8 it is always possible to choose @xmath232 and @xmath228 such that @xmath231 does not self - intersect .",
    "although this definition may seem somewhat artificial ( and indeed is introduced to accommodate the proof of the main result ) , the class of hyper - regular static @xmath93-dimensional spacetimes is fairly large .",
    "for instance , all sufficiently small static perturbations of minkowski spacetime are hyper - regular , as we now show .",
    "a curve @xmath236 is said to _ join _",
    "@xmath237 _ to infinity _ if it is unbounded .",
    "the set of points in all light geodesics joining two points @xmath238 is represented @xmath239 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the following result holds :    if no light geodesic self - intersects and for all @xmath240 there exists a curve @xmath241 joining @xmath242 to infinity such that @xmath243 then @xmath1 is hyper - regular .",
    "this proposition implies in particular that any sufficiently small perturbation of minkowski spacetime is hyper - regular .",
    "also , it is possible to show that from the three examples in the previous section only schwarzschild s spacetime is not hyper - regular .    if @xmath1 is hyper - regular then for @xmath228 small enough , @xmath26 can be deformed into @xmath244 .",
    "since @xmath1 is hyper - regular the causality surface is embedded and hence we can deform @xmath21 into along @xmath245 along the lifts of light geodesics without ever intersecting @xmath67 .",
    "we shall assume from this point on that @xmath1 is hyper - regular .",
    "we see that to understand the link @xmath26 we just have to understand the behaviour of the ribbons .",
    "since we can take @xmath217 as small as we like , we just have to consider the vector field @xmath246 along the lift of the corresponding light geodesic , which we do by studying the jacobi field @xmath175 .    at @xmath82",
    "we have @xmath247 , and hence the ribbon starts out vertical . since the derivative of the geodesic exponential map at the origin is the identity , for small @xmath95 the light geodesics are close to flat metric geodesics , and hence @xmath175 points towards the _ left _ with respect to the unit tangent vector @xmath248 .",
    "this means that the ribbon twists _ clockwise _ around @xmath249 as one follows the light geodesic in that direction .    in any time interval @xmath250",
    "such that @xmath251 we can deform the ribbon so that it stays horizontal ( thus initially the ribbon twists by an angle of @xmath252 with respect to the vertical direction ) . however , when a conjugate point is reached this is no longer possible . at such a point one",
    "has @xmath247 , but since any jacobi field satisfies a second order linear differential equation we must have @xmath253 ( where @xmath254 is the levi - civita connection for the light metric ) .",
    "thus if prior to reaching the conjugate point the jacobi field points _ left _ , afterwards it must point _ right _ , and vice - versa .",
    "consequently , either @xmath175 or @xmath255 go from left to right .",
    "this means that the corresponding boundary line of the ribbon goes from left to right , and it is easily seen that it does so at smaller values of @xmath56 than those of the geodesic ; in other words , the ribbon twists _ clockwise _ around @xmath249 by an angle of @xmath76 at each conjugate point as one follows the light geodesic in that direction ( as once it has passed the conjugate point the ribbon can be deformed back into the horizontal position ) .    since we are assuming that @xmath67 is not tangent to @xmath147 at the intersections , all ribbons are horizontal at the intersections .",
    "consequently we have proved    as one follows a light geodesic connecting @xmath144 to @xmath75 in the direction of @xmath249 , each ribbon rotates clockwise around this vector by an angle of @xmath256 with respect to the vertical direction , where @xmath257 is the number of conjugate points along the light geodesic .",
    "one of the key ingredients in the proof of the main result will be the following trivial observation :    as one follows a light geodesic connecting @xmath75 to @xmath144 in the direction of @xmath258 , each ribbon rotates _ clockwise _ around this vector by an angle of @xmath256 with respect to the vertical direction , where @xmath257 is the number of conjugate points along the light geodesic .",
    "the fact that the rotation is _ still _ clockwise is a consequence of the fact that we have reversed _ both _ the direction in which we are following the curve and the direction of the rotation axis .",
    "notice that @xmath259 is a disk , and hence orientable and two - sided . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath245 has a natural orientation as a deformation of @xmath21 .",
    "we can therefore introduce in @xmath231 the orientation induced by the orientation of @xmath245 , and use it to attribute a sign to each of the intersections in @xmath260 . as is well known",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , @xmath261 is exactly the sum of all signs of all these intersections .",
    "let @xmath1 be a hyper - regular static @xmath93-dimensional spacetime , and @xmath8 two causally related events not in the same null geodesic .",
    "then @xmath26 is not the unlink .",
    "we argue by contradiction : assume that @xmath262 is the unlink in @xmath2 ; then it is the unlink in @xmath53 , i.e. , there exists a smooth isotopy carrying @xmath244 to the boundaries of two disjoint disks , say .",
    "consequently there exists a disk @xmath263 such that @xmath264 and @xmath265 . since @xmath266 , however , we know that @xmath267 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath231 and @xmath263 are transverse ( since both @xmath245 and @xmath263 are compact , we just have to deform @xmath263 in an open neighbourhood of itself not intersecting an open neighbourhood of @xmath245 to get rid of any tangency points ) .",
    "then @xmath268 is a manifold , and hence consists either of closed curves or curves joining two points in the nonempty finite set @xmath269 ( which in particular must have an even number of points ) .",
    "take any curve of the latter kind . as a subset of @xmath263 it joins two points in the boundary , and",
    "hence we can turn it into a closed curve @xmath270 by adding a segment of @xmath271 between these two points .",
    "since the intersection curves can not intersect , it is possible to choose the initial curve such that @xmath270 contains exactly two intersection points in @xmath269 .",
    "notice that the subset of @xmath263 bound by @xmath270 is a disk @xmath272 .",
    "consider the curve @xmath273 obtained from @xmath270 by moving it by a small amount to the interior of @xmath272 .",
    "the subset of @xmath272 bound by @xmath273 will be another disk @xmath274 , and @xmath275 .",
    "consequently , we must have @xmath276 .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath270 is just a curve in @xmath231 joining two intersection points at the end of two ribbons plus a segment of @xmath67 , which is a meridian .",
    "the curve @xmath273 , in turn , is the push - off of @xmath270 away from @xmath231 along the transverse surface @xmath263 plus a segment close to the corresponding segment of @xmath67 in @xmath270 .",
    "this segment can not wind around @xmath67 , because @xmath277 and consequently @xmath278 .",
    "let @xmath279 be the number of conjugate points along the two light geodesics corresponding to the two ribbons . since @xmath280 , we must have @xmath281 ; consequently , the intersection points in @xmath270 must have opposite signs , and hence @xmath282 is necessarily odd .",
    "as @xmath273 is the push - off of @xmath270 away from @xmath231 , @xmath273 must wind around @xmath270 by an angle of @xmath283 with respect to the vertical direction along the ribbons ( see figure [ picture3 ] ) .",
    "deforming @xmath270 and @xmath273 along the meridians we then see that we must have @xmath284 , in contradiction with our previous assertion .",
    "we conclude that @xmath262 can not be the unlink .",
