    "universality  independence of the quantifiers of the geometry of orbits and bifurcation cascades in families of maps of the choice of a particular family  has been abundantly observed in area - preserving maps , both as the period - doubling universality @xcite and as the universality associated with the break - up of invariant surfaces @xcite , and in hamiltonian flows @xcite .    to prove",
    "universality one usually introduces a _ renormalization _ operator on a functional space , and demonstrates that this operator has a _ hyperbolic fixed point_. the renormalization approach to universality has been very successful in one - dimensional dynamics , and has led to explanation of universality in unimodal maps @xcite , critical circle maps @xcite and holomorphic maps with a siegel disk @xcite .",
    "there is , however , at present no deep understanding of universality in conservative systems , other than in the `` trivial '' case of the universality for systems `` near integrability '' @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that universality in conservative systems seems to be completely different from that in one - dimensional and dissipative maps . as it has been shown in @xcite , the case of very dissipative systems",
    "is largely reducible to the one - dimensional feigenbaum - coullet - tresser universality .    for families of area - preserving maps a universal infinite period - doubling cascade",
    "was observed by several authors in the early 80 s @xcite .",
    "the existence of a hyperbolic fixed point for the period - doubling renormalization operator has been proved with computer - assistance in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we used the method of covering relations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) in rigorous computations to construct hyperbolic sets for all maps in some neighborhood of the fixed point of the renormalization operator .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of these hyperbolic sets has been estimated with the help of the duarte distortion theorem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) which enables one to use the distortion of a cantor set to find bounds on its dimension .    in this paper",
    ", we prove that _ infinitely renormalizable _ maps in a neighborhood of existence of the hyperbolic sets also admit a `` stable '' set .",
    "this set is a bounded invariant set , such that the maximal lyapunov exponent at any point of this set is zero .",
    "together with our result from @xcite , this demonstrates that for all reversible area - preserving infinitely renormalizable maps in some neighborhood of the renormalization fixed point , there are coexisting hyperbolic and stable sets .",
    "we also address the issues of rigidity of the stable set and invariance of its hausdorff dimension .",
    "similar issues have been investigated in @xcite for attractors of very dissipative two - dimensional maps , where it has been shown that the regularity of conjugacy of attractors for two infinitely renormalizable maps @xmath8 and @xmath9 has a definite upper bound @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the `` average '' jacobian of the map @xmath8 .",
    "the authors of @xcite put forward two questions : 1 ) whether the hausdorff dimension of the attractor of an infinitely renormalizable map depends only on its average jacobian , and 2 ) how regular is the conjugacy when @xmath12 . in this regard ,",
    "we obtain a partial result along similar lines in the `` extreme '' case of area - preserving maps ( constant jacobian equal to one ) : we prove that there exists a subset of locally infinitely renormalizable maps such the actions of any two maps from this subset on their stable sets are conjugate by a bi - lipschitz map which preserves the hausdorff dimension .",
    "we can not make a definite conclusion about whether this subset is equal to the whole set of locally infinitely renormalizable maps , or strictly smaller , because a sharp bound on the convergence rate of renormalizations of infinitely renormalizable maps is not known to date .",
    "finally , we provide an upper bound on the hausdorff dimension of the stable set for all infinitely renormalizable maps .",
    "an `` area - preserving map '' will mean an exact symplectic diffeomorphism of a subset of @xmath0 onto its image .",
    "recall , that an area - preserving map can be uniquely specified by its generating function @xmath13 : @xmath14    furthermore , we will assume that @xmath8 is reversible , that is @xmath15    for such maps it follows from @xmath16 that @xmath17 and @xmath18    it is this `` little '' @xmath19 that will be referred to below as `` the generating function '' .",
    "if the equation @xmath20 has a unique differentiable solution @xmath21 , then the derivative of such a map @xmath8 is given by the following formula :    @xmath22.\\ ] ]    the period - doubling phenomenon can be illustrated with the area - preserving h ' enon family ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath23    maps @xmath24 have a fixed point @xmath25 which is stable for @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 this fixed point becomes unstable , at the same time an orbit of period two is born with @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "this orbit , in turn , becomes unstable at @xmath30 , giving birth to a period @xmath31 stable orbit .",
    "generally , there exists a sequence of parameter values @xmath32 , at which the orbit of period @xmath33 turns unstable , while at the same time a stable orbit of period @xmath34 is born .",
    "the parameter values @xmath32 accumulate on some @xmath35 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the accumulation rate @xmath36 is universal for a large class of families , not necessarily hnon .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath34 periodic orbits scale asymptotically with two scaling parameters @xmath37    to explain how orbits scale with @xmath38 and @xmath39 we will follow @xcite . consider an interval @xmath40 of parameter values in a `` typical '' family @xmath41 . for",
    "any value @xmath42 the map @xmath43 possesses a stable periodic orbit of period @xmath44 .",
    "we fix some @xmath45 within the interval @xmath40 in some consistent way ; for instance , by requiring that the restriction of @xmath46 to a neighborhood of a stable periodic point in the @xmath44-periodic orbit is conjugate , via a diffeomorphism @xmath47 , to a rotation with some fixed rotation number @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 be some unstable periodic point in the @xmath33-periodic orbit , and let @xmath50 be the further of the two stable @xmath44-periodic points that bifurcated from @xmath49 . denote with @xmath51 , the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",
    "the new elliptic point @xmath50 is surrounded by invariant ellipses ; let @xmath52 be the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath49 in the direction of the minor semi - axis of an invariant ellipse surrounding @xmath50 , see figure [ bifgeom ] . then , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ratio of the smaller and larger eigenvalues of @xmath55 .",
    "this universality can be explained rigorously if one shows that the _ renormalization _ operator @xmath56=\\lambda^{-1}_f \\circ f \\circ f \\circ \\lambda_f,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is some @xmath8-dependent coordinate transformation , has a fixed point , and the derivative of this operator is hyperbolic at this fixed point .    it has been argued in @xcite that @xmath57 is a diagonal linear transformation . furthermore , such @xmath57 has been used in @xcite and @xcite in a computer assisted proof of existence of a reversible renormalization fixed point @xmath1 and hyperbolicity of the operator @xmath58 .",

    "we have demonstrated that the hausdorff dimension of the stable set for the maps @xmath8 in the subset @xmath283 of the infinitely renormalizable maps is independent of @xmath8 , and that the stable dynamics for two infinitely renormalizable maps in @xmath283 is bi - lipschitz - conjugate .",
    "this is quite weaker than the corresponding result about the invariance of the hausdorff dimension of the feigenbaum attractor for all infinitely renormalizable unimodal maps ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it does demonstrate that one should expect at least some kind of rigidity of invariant sets for infinitely renormalizable maps in conservative dynamics  rigidity which was absent in dissipative maps ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our proof of the bi - lipschitz property of the conjugacy between stable sets @xmath284 and @xmath285 balances two phenomena that , in a sense , work against each other : convergence of renormalizations of maps @xmath286 versus the fact that the rates of contraction of distances in different directions by maps @xmath57 and @xmath287 are essentially different . a careful look at the proof shows that the bi - lipschitz property is achieved if the convergence rate @xmath288 is sufficiently small to `` counteract '' the relative size of contractions .",
    "however , this is not the case with the upper bound @xmath104 on @xmath288 at hand .",
    "although this upper bound is by no means sharp , it does indicate that one might need to choose a submanifold @xmath283 of @xmath126 on which the convergence rate is smaller .",
    "another obvious issue for investigation is whether the bi - lipschitz conjugacy of the stable sets extends to their neighborhood as a @xmath289 map .",
    "again , this is the case for the conjugacies between attractors of the unimodal maps ( see @xcite ) , and it is not for very dissipative maps where , as we have already mentioned , the regularity of the conjugacy of attractors for two maps @xmath8 and @xmath9 has a definite upper bound @xmath290 .",
