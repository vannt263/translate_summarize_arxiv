    "it is clear that in the underdoped region the difference between these two characteristic temperatures is larger than the overdoped side , suggesting a larger superconducting fluctuation effect in the underdoped region with a more conventional behavior in the overdoped region .",
    "how do we understand the superconducting fluctuations in the electron - doped cuprates ?",
    "it is known that superconductivity is characterized by a complex order parameter @xmath29 , with an amplitude @xmath30 and a phase @xmath31 at each space point .",
    "@xcite fluctuations in either amplitude or phase will affect the superconducting properties .",

    "@xcite calculated the transverse thermoelectric coefficient which results from the amplitude fluctuations : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the transverse peltier conductivity , @xmath34 is the magnetic length and @xmath35 is the in - plane coherence length .",
    "the vortex nernst signal , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the conductivity ) , is mainly proportional to the in - plane coherence length @xmath38 . in the electron - doped cuprates , the in - plane coherence length increases with doping ( h@xmath26 decreases rapidly with doping  @xcite ) and thus from eq .",
    "[ 1 ] one would expect a stronger fluctuation effect as doping increases .",
    "however , the absence of fluctuation effects in the overdoped pcco contradicts this theoretical expectation .",
    "in addition , compared to the hole - doped cuprates ( e.g. lsco ) , electron - doped cuprates have a much longer coherence length ( about one order of magnitude larger  @xcite ) , yet a weaker fluctuation effect is observed : the fluctuation regime , @xmath39 is about 0.5 for pcco with _ _ x__=0.13 and 4 for lsco with _ _ x__=0.1 ( t@xmath4=20 k ) .",
    "@xcite these two results strongly suggest that conventional amplitude fluctuation theory can not explain the nernst effect results in underdoped electron - doped cuprates .",
    "now we turn to phase fluctuations , which are claimed to explain the anomalous nernst effect in the hole - doped cuprates . in conventional superconductors ,",
    "phase fluctuations plays an insignificant role in determining the transition temperature because of the large superfluid density @xmath6 .",
    "however , in the high - t@xmath4 superconductors , the proximity to the mott insulator leads to a very small superfluid density .",
    "therefore , it is possible that long - range phase coherence is destroyed at t@xmath4 while the local cooper pairing amplitude remains sizable .",
    "the significance of the phase fluctuation can be assessed by evaluating the phase stiffness temperature ,  @xcite @xmath40 , at which phase order would disappear ( here @xmath41 the spacing between adjacent cuo@xmath42 layers , @xmath43=0.9 is a numeric factor for quasi-2d systems and @xmath44 the effective mass ) . if t@xmath45t@xmath46 , phase fluctuations are relatively unimportant , and t@xmath4 will be close to the mean - field transition temperature , t@xmath47 , as predicted by bcs theory .",
    "on the other hand , if t@xmath48t@xmath4 , then t@xmath4 is determined primarily by phase ordering , and t@xmath47 is simply the characteristic temperature below which pairing becomes significant locally . in conventional superconductors , t@xmath46 is orders of magnitude larger than t@xmath4 , and phase coherence is so strong that t@xmath4 is the cooper pair formation temperature . in the overdoped hole - doped cuprates , t@xmath46/t@xmath4 is around 2 - 5 , suggesting that phase fluctuations become more important . in the underdoped hole - doped cuprates ,",
    "t@xmath46 is very close to t@xmath4 , suggesting that phase fluctuations are dominant in determining the superconducting phase transition .",
    "the fluctuations suppress the transition temperature from the mean - field value t@xmath49 , at which cooper pairs form , to the observed t@xmath4 where long - rang phase coherence is established . in the electron - doped cuprate pcco",
    ", penetration depth measurements gave @xmath50=9 , 15 and 40 @xmath51 for _ _ x__=0.13 , 0.15 and 0.17 respectively .",
    "using the relation @xmath52 , we can estimate the t@xmath46/t@xmath4 value for pcco .",
    "simple calculation gives t@xmath46/t@xmath4=2 , 2.4 and 11 for 0.13 , 0.15 and 0.17 respectively .",
    "thus , phase fluctuations are suppressed in the overdoped region since @xmath53 and then @xmath54 . although the values of t@xmath46/t@xmath4 of the underdoped and optimally - doped pcco are close to those of optimally - doped and overdoped lsco , the fluctuation regime is somewhat narrower in pcco than lsco ( @xmath55=0.5@xmath200.1 for pcco with @xmath56=0.13 , 1.2@xmath200.1 for lsco @xmath56=0.17 .",
    "@xcite ) a likely reason is the weaker coupling of the cooper pairs in the electron - doped cuprates .",

    "@xcite the value of @xmath57 is smaller in pcco ( @xmath21 3.5 ) than in lsco ( @xmath21 8) .",
    "this suggests that the temperature driven pair - breaking effect is stronger in pcco , so that any local pairing can not survive with increasing temperature .",
    "thus , the thermal pair breaking competes with the phase fluctuation effect and reduces the size of the fluctuation region .",

    "solid line is the zero - field resistivity .",
    "inset shows the procedure of obtaining the zero - field normal state resistivity [ dashed lines in ( a ) and ( b ) ] . ]",
    "in addition , our resistivity measurements on the underdoped and optimally - doped pcco films also show some interesting results . as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the solid curves are the zero - field resistivity of @xmath56=0.13 and 0.15 . in order to eliminate the negative magnetoresistance at these dopings , we measured the in - plane resistivity versus field at different temperatures and extrapolated the data to get the  effective \" zero - field normal state resistivity .",
    "its temperature dependence is shown as dashed curve in fig .",
    "the arrows mark the temperature where the zero - field resistivity deviates from the zero - field normal state resistivity .",
    "interestingly , the onset temperature of the deviation is slightly higher than the onset temperatures of the vortex nernst effect in both underdoped and optimally - doped samples . although the excessive conductivity ( paraconductivity ) is usually attributed to amplitude fluctuations ,  @xcite this is not certain in pcco case because phase fluctuations could also induce the enhanced conductivity above t@xmath4 . however , to distinguish these fluctuations is difficult theoretically and experimentally and it is beyond our knowledge and the scope of this paper .",
    "we mention that a planar tunneling experiment in pcco observed a normal state energy gap throughout the entire doping range .",
    "@xcite this normal state gap persists to a temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath4 in the underdoped region but follows t@xmath4 on the overdoped side ( inset of fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this was interpreted as a result of finite pairing amplitude above t@xmath4 in the underdoped region .",
    "the onset temperature of the vortex nernst signal extends into this region , suggesting that may be related to the normal state gap seen the tunneling .      to summarize this part , we carefully investigated the superconducting fluctuation effects in pcco films by nernst effect measurements .",
    "we found that the fluctuations are stronger in the underdoped region than in the overdoped region .",
    "we argued against amplitude fluctuations as an explanation of this observation .",
    "it is likely that phase fluctuations are responsible for the normal state vortex signal in the underdoped pcco films .",
    "this is consistent with the anomalous nernst effect found in the hole - doped cuprates .",

    "let us first compare the vortex nernst signal ( t@xmath63t@xmath4 ) and the normal state ( t@xmath27t@xmath4 ) for h=2 t in an underdoped _ _ x__=0.13 film . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , two peaks are prominent in the temperature dependence of the nernst signal .",

    "[ 6 ] will vanish and the first term will be enhanced . meanwhile , the counterflow of carriers with different sign in eq .",
    "[ 7 ] , i.e. , @xmath117 , will lead to a small thermopower . thus",
    ", in pcco , the enhanced nernst signal and small thermopower near optimal doping supports the two - band model . for the underdoped _",
    "_ x__=0.13 and 0.11 , a larger thermopower is found  @xcite and the nernst signal is still large .",
    "this could be due to a contribution from the emerging hole band , as found in the arpes experiments .",
    "@xcite      the small thermopower  @xcite and sizable nernst signal ( comparable to the optimal doping ) in the overdoped _ _ x__=0.19 also suggests a possible two - band contribution .",
    "however , this appears to be incompatible with the single large hole pocket seen in arpes .",
    "@xcite to explore this further , we look at @xmath118 obtained from the thermopower  @xcite and the hall angle measurements ,  @xcite for all the doped pcco films . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , @xmath118 decreases with increasing doping and its magnitude is much smaller than the nernst signal in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for all the dopings except the extremely underdoped _ _ x__=0.05 . as we just described , to have a large nernst signal , the difference between @xmath118 ( the second term in eq .",
    "[ 7 ] ) and @xmath119 ( the first term in eq .  [ 7 ] ) has to be large . in pcco ,",
    "the large difference in the magnitude of @xmath58 and @xmath118 ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] and fig .  [ fig7 ] ) suggests a large thermal hall angle @xmath120 ( recall that _ s _ is small ) .",
    "therefore , the large value of @xmath121 indicates a two - carrier contribution .",
    "this is also seen in the overdoped pcco from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , strongly suggesting the incompatibility with the single hole - like fs expectation .",
    "note , for a single carrier system , such as the extremely underdoped @xmath56=0.05 pcco , the small nernst signal is comparable to @xmath118 , suggests a negligible @xmath119 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that two - band transport in the highly overdoped pcco is also consistent with the high - field nonlinear hall resistivity .",
    "@xcite    we have shown that the anomalous large normal state nernst effect and small @xmath118 in the overdoped pcco films are qualitatively consistent with a two - band model .",
    "however , this is contrary to the arpes experiments ,  @xcite in which a simple hole - like fermi pocket is found for doping @xmath1220.17 .",
    "another possible reason for the enhanced nernst signal , as indicated in eq .",
    "[ 2 ] , could be a strong anisotropic energy dependence of the scattering @xmath123 at the fermi surface .",
    "the remanent contribution of `` hot spots '' near the ( @xmath124 ) region to the nernst signal could be dominant even in the overdoped regime .",
    "the magnetoresistance in a two - carrier system is closely related to the nernst effect . from eq .  [ 6 ] and [ 8 ] , one can rewrite the nernst coefficient as  @xcite : @xmath125 the magnetoresistance for a two - band system is  @xcite @xmath126 the second term of eq .  [",
    "9 ] is responsible for the potentially larger nernst signal with respect to a single carrier system .",
    "the factor @xmath127 can reach a maximum value if the mobilities are large and @xmath128 , which will lead to an enhanced nernst signal .",
    "from eq .",
    "[ 10 ] , we can identify the same mobility coefficient , @xmath129 , found in the nernst coefficient .",
    "this indicates that a maximum of the magnetoresistance is likely to coincide with a maximum of the nernst coefficient as the doping and the mobilities change .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show the magnetoresistance at 50 k as a function of ce content .",
    "we see that the transverse magnetoresistance is large and positive ( compared to the magnetoresistance in the p - doped cuprates , which is one order of magnitude smaller ) for all the superconducting films .",
    "the maximum magnetoresistance occurs around optimal doping , at which doping , the nernst signal [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ] also reach a maximum .",
    "the strong correlation between nernst effect and the magnetoresistance strongly suggests that pcco is a two - band system for dopings in the superconducting dome region of the phase diagram .",
    "finally , we discuss the higher temperature peak feature that found in the temperature dependence of the nernst signal [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] .",
    "a similar peak feature was found in thermopower measurements which suggests a common origin .",
    "a prior work  @xcite proposed that the thermoelectric power of the underdoped hole - doped cuprates could reveal the opening of a pseudogap .",
    "the pseudogap increases the thermopower leading to a broad maximum above t@xmath4 but below t@xmath28 . for the pcco system",
    ", we also observed a maximum thermopower at fairly high temperature ( between 50 k and 100 k ) with respect to t@xmath4 in the underdoped region .",
    "it is possible that the thermopower is influenced by the high temperature gap found in the optics and arpes measurements .",
    "@xcite the transverse thermoelectric effect , i.e. , nernst effect , also presents a broad higher temperature peak in the entire doping range .",
    "the peak feature could also be a result of the influence of the high energy gap and fluctuations in the overdoped region .",
    "further understanding of this will require future study .",
    "the peak feature in the temperature dependence of the nernst signal could also be a result of a phonon - drag effect . as proposed by behnia _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for bismuth , in the ettingshausen geometry ( transverse temperature gradient generated by external magnetic field when a longitudinal electrical current is present ) , when electrons interact with phonons , the electric current gives rise to an entropy current of phononic origin , and a significant ettingshausen effect . since the onsager relation ties the amplitudes of the ettingshausen and nernst effects , this implies that the nernst effect should also be enhanced .",
    "however , the application of this model to the pcco case is not clear at this time and future work is required .",
    "we performed measurements of the magnetic field driven normal state nernst effect on electron - doped cuprate pr@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 films over a wide range of doping and temperature .",
    "we find an anomalously large nernst signal near optimal doping , which is consistent with prior reports .",
    "more interestingly , the nernst signal is still large in the highly overdoped films and the slightly underdoped films .",
    "this can not be explained by a single - band model , and a two - band model has to be considered .",
    "the qualitative consistence between the experimental transport data and the two - band model for the overdoped films , which appears inconsistent with arpes experiments , will require further research .",
