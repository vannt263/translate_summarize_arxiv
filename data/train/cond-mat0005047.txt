    "understanding the structure of the states of three dimensional ( @xmath0 ) ising spin glasses at finite temperature is a very interesting problem .",
    "long time ago a mean field theory for spin glasses has been constructed and successfully compared with the numerical properties of a long range model , the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , where mean field theory is exact by definition @xcite .    in the mean field approach one",
    "finds that the free energy landscape is strongly corrugated , and it is characterized by the presence of many local minima , which correspond to spin configurations very different one from the other .",
    "there are many low free energy local minima which have a total free energy which differs from the ground state free energy of an amount which is of order @xmath1 ; these minima contribute to the probability distribution of the spins also for arbitrary large volumes .",
    "in some sense one can say that in the infinite volume there are many equilibrium states ( for a better qualification of the terminology see @xcite ) : these states are locally different one from the other . for historical reasons",
    "this picture goes under the name of _ replica symmetry breaking _ ( rsb ) .",
    "since analytic progress on finite dimensional system is hard , the study of @xmath0 systems has mainly been based on numerical simulations .",
    "most of the numerical simulations have investigated systems of size up to @xmath2 and temperature values greater or equal than half of the critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) : the results are in very good agreement with the rsb picture . using the best techniques that are available to us today it is impossible to thermalize in a reasonable amount of time systems of this size at much lower temperature : because of that at today the very low temperature region can not be explored using monte carlo simulations . on the other",
    "end a different class of algorithms exists which allow the determination of the ground state at zero temperature for systems of comparable size @xcite : it is clear that it would be very interesting to compare the results of the rsb approach with the numerical results at zero temperature .",
    "we face however a difficulty : in the rsb approach one computes quantities at finite temperature in the infinite volume limit , while if we look first for the ground state in a finite volume and only later we send the volume to infinity we are exchanging the order of the two limits .",
    "one can assume in a tentative way that the two limits can be exchanged , in the sense that in the zero temperature limit the probability distributions of the free energies of different equilibrium states becomes the probability distributions of the local minima of the energy : this has been the point of view of the authors that have employed this technique in the last months , it is not incompatible with any of the findings obtained to date , and we will do the same in the following .    of course at zero temperature",
    "the ground state ( i.e. the global minimum of the energy ) of a finite volume system with quenched random couplings selected under a continuous distribution is unique , so that interesting information can be extracted for example if we consider the effects of an external perturbation .",
    "different choices are possible . in a recent , very interesting paper , palassini and young @xcite have shown that it is possible to get useful information about the nature of the low @xmath4 phase of @xmath0 ising spin glasses with gaussian distributed couplings by studying the behavior of the ground state after changing the boundary conditions of an @xmath5 lattice system from periodic ( @xmath6 ) to anti - periodic ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "they analyze ground states ( @xmath8 ) obtained with the same realization of the quenched disorder and different boundary conditions ( or with disorder realizations that differ only in some locations ) for @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we perform a more detailed analysis of the same systems by considering a larger set of observables . here",
    "we use a modified genetic algorithm which is more efficient than the original algorithm and that will be described in details elsewhere @xcite . this modified algorithm has allowed us to study larger systems ( @xmath10 ) than in former work .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the whole set of data strongly suggests that the picture based on replica symmetry breaking is correct in describing the behavior of @xmath0 spin glasses .",
    "as we have already discussed in the introduction we consider a @xmath0 ising spin glass with quenched couplings assigned under a gaussian probability distribution with zero expectation value , and we study the behavior of the ground state after changing the boundary conditions ( @xmath11 ) of a simple cubic lattice system of size @xmath12 from periodic ( @xmath13 ) to anti - periodic ( @xmath14 ) . when we do such a change the ground state is usually modified and in the new ground state some spins are reversed .",
    "let us call @xmath15 and @xmath16 the spins in the ground states with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions respectively .",
    "the local overlap on site @xmath17 is defined as    @xmath18    the link overlap is defined on the links and it is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the direction of the link , that can take @xmath21 positive and @xmath21 negative values . if two spin configurations differ by a global reverse of the spins their link overlap is identically equal to one ( while their overlap is equal to @xmath22 ) .",
    "we will consider in the following the case where we flip the boundary conditions in the direction @xmath23 , while we leave them unchanged in directions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    in a first approximation ( neglecting the points at the boundaries ,",
    "see next subsection ) we can define the interface among the flipped and the non flipped region as the sets of link where @xmath26 .",
    "we are interested in finding out the geometrical properties of this interface in the infinite volume limit .",
    "of course the probability of finding the interface on a random link is given by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the disorder expectation value of @xmath29 , averaged over sites @xmath17 and directions @xmath20 .",
    "here we discuss a few possible situations :    1 .",
    "the interface is confined in a region of width @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 ) : inside this region the interface may have overhangs .",
    "the interface density goes to zero as @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "this is what happens in ferromagnetic models , both with ordered and disordered hamiltonians , where @xmath34 , al least in the ordered case .",
    "we will see immediately that this possibility is completely excluded by the data .",
    "the wandering exponent @xmath25 is equal to one and the interface density goes to zero as @xmath32 .",
    "we also assume than in the large volume limit the interface is a fractal object with fractal dimension @xmath35 ( where the space dimension @xmath21 is equal to 3 ) .",
    "more precisely we assume that if we define a continuous coordinate ( in the interval @xmath36 $ ] ) as @xmath37 , in the infinite volume limit the interface becomes a fractal object defined on the continuum characterized by a fractal dimension @xmath38 .",
    "in other words we are assuming that the interface is not a multi - fractal ( i.e. that it can be characterized by a single fractal dimensions as usually happens for fractal objects one defines on a lattice in statistical mechanics ) , and so the relation @xmath35 is consistent .",
    "the exponent @xmath39 is equal to zero and the density @xmath40 goes to a non zero value ( i.e. @xmath28 does not go to @xmath1 in the large volume limit ) . here",
    "the interface is space filling and in the above described continuum limit , the interface is a dense set of measure @xmath1 .",
    "we expect that the probability that the interface does not intersect a region @xmath41 , whose size is proportional to the system size , goes to zero when the volume goes to infinity . on the contrary in the previous case",
    "such a probability would be a non trivial function of @xmath41 . as we shall see later , this possibility is the one realized in the case of rsb .",
    "4 .   there is a last possibility , which is unusual , and we mention for completeness ( although its description will take a disproportionate amount of space ) : this is when the wandering exponent @xmath25 is equal to one and @xmath39 is greater than zero , but in continuum limit the interface does not become a fractal object of dimension @xmath35 , but it becomes a dense set .",
    "this happens for example if we consider a set of parallel planes at distance proportional to @xmath42 or a set of isolated points at distance @xmath43 . in both cases the density goes to zero as @xmath32 , but",
    "the resulting object is _ not _ a fractal in the infinite volume limit .",
    "a similar case happens in three dimensions if we take a random walk of length @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the system is a fractal of dimension @xmath38 up to a distance @xmath46 , while it looks homogeneous at larger distances .",
    "+ in this case the density - density correlation function will scale as + @xmath47 + in the region @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the co - dimension of the fractal ( the underlying random walk in our case ) .",
    "we will denote by the upper bar the average over the quenched disorder . on the contrary in the region",
    "@xmath50 the correlation function will scale as + @xmath51 + the condition that at large distances the term in equation ( [ dis ] ) dominates over the one in equation ( [ con ] ) implies that @xmath52",
    ". moreover the two formulas must be consistent in the crossover region where @xmath53 . imposing this condition",
    "one finds that @xmath54 and therefore we obtain that + @xmath55 + this case is anomalous in the sense that usual scaling is not valid and there is a crossover length which increases as a fractional power of the side of the system .",
    "the usual scaling law ( valid in the region @xmath56 ) + @xmath57 + is not satisfied and it is replaced by the unusual relation + @xmath58 + only in the case @xmath59 we are in a familiar situation : in this case the crossover length @xmath60 does not diverge for large @xmath61 and we recover the third case of our list .      in the replica approach",
    "one finds that at zero temperature there are many different local minima of the hamiltonian such that even in the limit where @xmath61 goes to infinity the difference among the energy of the ground state and the energy of such minima is of order @xmath1 .",
    "it is crucial that the among these minima there are some whose site overlap @xmath62 and link overlap @xmath63 with the ground state remains different from @xmath1 in large volume limit .",
    "it is also important to assume that for large volumes there exists a function @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , in other words that for fixed overlap @xmath62 the link overlap @xmath28 does not fluctuate when the volume goes to infinity .",
    "when in a @xmath0 spin glass the boundary conditions in the @xmath23 direction are flipped from positive to negative it is known that the total energy changes by an amount @xmath66 , which increases as a power of @xmath61 . in a ferromagnet , where the ground state is unique",
    ", the ground state obtained under anti - periodic condition would be locally similar to the ground state obtained under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in other words in any region of side @xmath67 , if the region does not intersect the interface , which is just a flat surface , the ground state spin configuration obtained under anti - periodic boundary conditions will be equal ( or equal to the reverse ) to the ground state obtained under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a similar conclusion holds in the case of a spin glass behaving according to the predictions of the droplet model @xcite , where the boundary may be a corrugated surface : in this case we expect that the link overlap among the ground states obtained with @xmath6 and @xmath7 tends to one in the infinite volume limit . on the contrary in the case of a rsb like behavior the ground state obtained under @xmath7",
    "can be locally similar to one of the low energy excited states : in this case the link overlap among the two ground states can tend to a value _ different _ from one as @xmath68 .",
    "that an excited state may be selected as new ground state when changing the boundary conditions is strongly suggested by the fact that the energy difference among ground states obtained with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions increases with @xmath61 , while the difference among the ground state energy and the excited state energy at fixed boundary conditions remains fixed .",
    "the nature of the excited state that is selected when we change the boundary conditions can not easily derived using simple arguments .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in three dimensions , where @xmath66 which increases as a power of @xmath61 , the new ground state will be as different as possible from the old ground state : one expects the overlap @xmath62 among the two ground states to vanish in this limit .",
    "the interest in changing the boundary conditions is also due to the fact that this is also a convenient method to to study the properties of the excited states .",
    "other methods can be used to clarify similar questions , but we will not use them here .      in order to change the boundary conditions in the @xmath23 direction we can change the sign of all the couplings connecting the plane @xmath69 with the plane @xmath70 .",
    "the choice of @xmath71 does not matter : the ground state energy does not depend on @xmath71 , and the ground state obtained after a different choice of the reversed plane ( e.g. @xmath72 ) can be obtained starting from the ground state where anti - periodic boundary conditions have been enforced at @xmath71 , by flipping all the spins in the interval @xmath73 .",
    "in other words going from periodic to anti - periodic boundary conditions is a global change that locally is not visible . at this end",
    "it is convenient to define quantities which are gauge invariant , in the sense that they do not change when the plane where the anti - periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "let us consider a very simple example : the correct definition of @xmath74 is    @xmath75    where @xmath23 is the first component of the three dimensional vector @xmath17 .",
    "a more complex case is the definition of the window overlap @xcite in a box of side @xmath67 which intersects the plane @xmath69 . here",
    "the overlap @xmath76 can be defined as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the set of points of the box which are respectively on the right and on the left of the plane @xmath69 .",
    "the advantage of this prescription ( which can be easily generalized to more complex situations ) is that in absence of a magnetic field nothing depends on the actual position of the plane where the boundary conditions are enforced : the fact that the reversal of the spins is imposed at a given value of @xmath23 is immaterial .",
    "the presence of this translational invariance is very effective from a practical point of view : the expectation value of @xmath28 does not depend on the point , so that data can be taken on the whole lattice .",
    "the possibility of doing measurements on the whole lattice and not only far from the point where the boundary conditions are changed reduces the statistical errors in a substantial way .",
    "we have computed @xmath80 couples of ground states on three dimensional lattices of linear size @xmath81 , @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 for @xmath87 , @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 : for each sample of the quenched disorder ( gaussian couplings ) we have computed the two ground states under periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions , using a modified genetic algorithm which will be described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the introduction of anti - periodic boundary conditions breaks the discrete rotational invariance of the simple cubic lattice , so that the expectation value of @xmath92 , i.e. of the link overlap in the @xmath23 direction , can be different from that of the link overlap in the other two directions . in the ferromagnetic case ( without disorder )",
    "the change of the boundary conditions produces an interface in one of the @xmath93 planes .",
    "we will call _ perpendicular link overlap _ @xmath94 the expectation value of @xmath92 averaged over the lattice sites , since it is perpendicular to the @xmath93 interface , while we will call _ transverse link overlap _ @xmath95 the average over sites of the quantity @xmath96 .    in the ferromagnetic case ( without disorder )",
    "one finds that    @xmath97    we show in figure ( [ qlink ] ) the numerical data for @xmath98 and @xmath99 in our @xmath0 spin glass .",
    "it is clear that the difference @xmath100 goes to zero with @xmath101 : it can be very well fitted as @xmath102 with @xmath103 and a normalized @xmath104 of order one .",
    "it is also evident that @xmath99 is with a very good approximation a linear function of @xmath105 in the same way it would be in the ferromagnetic case , with the difference that here the extrapolation in the @xmath68 limit is clearly different from zero .",
    "a closer look shows that @xmath99 is not exactly a linear function of @xmath105 , and it can be very well fitted ( with a normalized @xmath106 of order one ) as a second order polynomial in @xmath105 .",
    "the same polynomial fit works very well also for @xmath98 .",
    "the two fits extrapolate to the same value ( in the limit given by the statistical error ) . in the same picture",
    "we show also the data for @xmath107 , i.e. the value we measure for @xmath99 in our spin glass minus its _ a priori _ lower bound , which coincides with the value in the ferromagnetic case , and we note it has a very weak dependence over @xmath61 .    ,",

    "the fits are good ( they would also be good for similar values of @xmath179 ) so that the whole data can be reconstructed by the knowledge of the parameters @xmath180 and @xmath181 , which are shown in figure ( [ ab ] ) .     with @xmath170 as a function of @xmath167 . here",

    "we show both a a power fit and a polynomial fit in @xmath101 .",
    "[ ab],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    while @xmath180 displays some dependence on @xmath61 , there is no hint that the quantity @xmath181 should go to zero when @xmath182 .",
    "certainly both of them do not go to zero as @xmath32 with @xmath183 as expected in the case of possibility ( 4 ) , and they can be consistently extrapolated to a non - zero value . if we would insist on power law fits we would find a value of @xmath184 for @xmath180 and a ridiculous value of @xmath185 for @xmath181 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath180 , that should tend to the link overlap in the @xmath68 limit , tends to @xmath186 , to be compared with the value @xmath187 ( see equation ( [ e - twofourfive ] ) ) that we have derived from a completely different analysis : the picture that emerges from these data give consistent support to a rsb physical scenario .",
    "also it is worth to comment more on the power fit of figure ( [ ab ] ) : even if they are compatible with the data it looks clear they are only minimally consistent with the physical behavior shown by the measured points .",
    "typically these fits stay basically constant for all measured @xmath61 values , and than they forecast a sharp descend at very high @xmath61 values : the polynomial fits show on the contrary a consistent behavior in the measured @xmath61 range and in the @xmath68 limit .",
    "the second scenario we have discussed is in complete variance with the behavior of the correlation function data .",
    "the exponent @xmath179 should be @xmath188 , not @xmath189 , as indicated by the data .",
    "this conclusion is in perfect agreement with the results of the hole probability distribution .",
    "we are now ready to analyze the possible correctness of the fourth scenario we have discussed ( the interface is a dense set in the continuum limit ) .",
    "the results of figure ( [ deltag ] ) show that we should have @xmath190 .",
    "the fact that the interface would have a fractal dimension less than 2 is strange , but not impossible : the interface could look like the surface of t - lymphocytes , which is full of microvilli , i.e. quasi one dimensional objects .",
    "however in this case the correlation function ( and therefore the correlation functions at fixed distance ) should go to zero as @xmath32 : the correlation functions at distances of order @xmath61 should go to zero as @xmath191 .",
    "the scaling observed in figure ( [ deltag ] ) should not be there .",
    "the two exponents @xmath192 and @xmath193 should be both equal to @xmath194 , which we have already seen it is not true .",
    "it is evident that also the exotic possibility ( 4 ) is not compatible with the observed form of the link overlap correlations ( which are perfectly compatible with simple scaling laws without anomalies ) , and the only possibilities is given by the behavior implied by the rsb scenario .",
    "here we consider the overlap correlation function . in this case",
    "we can define two interesting correlation functions : the transverse correlation function    @xmath195    and the perpendicular correlation function    @xmath196    where @xmath197 is factor which implements gauge invariance : it is equal to @xmath22 if the line which connects the points @xmath23 and @xmath198 crosses the plane where boundary conditions are changed .",
    "the two correlations functions are respectively periodic and anti - periodic functions of @xmath21 with period @xmath61 ( @xmath199 ) .     as a function of @xmath200 .",
    "the upper dots are for the perpendicular correlation function divided an additional factor @xmath201 .",
    "lines are best fits ( see the text ) .",
    "[ overcf],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we notice that    @xmath202    consequently an analysis of the combined @xmath167 and @xmath61 dependence of the overlap - overlap correlation functions can give information on the origin of the @xmath61 dependence of the link overlap , which coincide with the overlap - overlap correlation function at distance @xmath1 .",
    "according to the previous analysis of the window overlap we expect that the two correlations functions to scale as    @xmath203    the plot of figure ( [ overcf ] ) shows a very good scaling , and two parameter polynomial fits work very well .",
    "transversal and perpendicular correlation functions go to the same limit when @xmath204 .",
    "since the perpendicular correlation function is identically zero in @xmath205 , we also plot the perpendicular @xmath206 divided times @xmath201 , removing in this way the main @xmath200 dependence , which comes from a kinematical effect : it goes very smoothly to the correct limit when @xmath207 .",
    "the extrapolated values are @xmath208 for the transverse correlation function and @xmath209 for the perpendicular one .",
    "this is well consistent with the estimate quoted before ( and obtained by measuring a completely different quantity ) for the link overlap , @xmath210 .    as a consistency check we plot in figure ( [ meta ] ) the correlation function @xmath211 as function of @xmath61 .",
    "the data can be fitted very well by simple power fit @xmath212 , with @xmath213 .",
    "it is clear that we have identified a physical mechanism which naturally generates an @xmath101 dependence in @xmath28 ( correlation functions do usually feel the size of the system ) : simple scaling laws are valid and the ground state structure is non trivial . on the contrary a trivial structure ( in the sense of the droplet model ) would imply that the quantities @xmath214 extrapolate at @xmath1 when @xmath215 goes to zero ( which is evidently not true ) or they do not satisfy a simple scaling and there is a crossover region of length @xmath46 which goes to infinity with @xmath61 .",
    "both these possibilities are not compatible with the data which strongly suggested the rsb scenario .     as function @xmath61 @xmath109 @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",

    "we have studied the overlap among the two ground states obtained under periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions for @xmath0 lattice of linear sizes @xmath61 up to @xmath91 .",
    "we have analyzed many different observables : the average of the link overlap , the probability that the a cube of size @xmath67 or a plane hits the interface , the window overlap probability distribution and the correlation functions of the link overlap and the overlap .",
    "the droplet model in the usual form assumes that the interface density ( which is one minus the link overlap ) goes to zero for large @xmath61 as @xmath32 , and that the interface is a fractal with dimension @xmath216 .",
    "a small subset of our numerical data is consistent with the possibility the interface density could go to zero as @xmath32 , but other data can not be fitted as a simple power and strongly suggest that the interface density remains finite in the limit @xmath217 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath218 is completely excluded by the data .",
