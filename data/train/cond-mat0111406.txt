    "in the past few years a great amount of work has been devoted to studying the kondo effect in mesoscopic systems@xcite .",
    "a motivation for these efforts was the recent experimental observation of the kondo effect in tunneling through a small quantum dot@xcite . in these experiments",
    "the effective ( or excess ) electronic spin of the dot acts as a magnetic impurity .    a different set of problems relating the kondo effect to the physics of quantum dots is encountered when studying fluctuations of the charge of a large coulomb - blockaded quantum dot .",
    "the setup we have in mind consists of a large quantum dot coupled to a reservoir via a quantum point contact ( qpc ) and capacitively coupled ( with a capacitance @xmath0 ) to a back - gate ( see fig .",
    "[ dot ] ) .",
    "the amount of charge on the dot can be changed through the gate voltage @xmath1 .",
    "the term `` large '' implies that the spacing @xmath2 of the energy levels on the dot ( almost ) vanishes and is much smaller than the dot s charging energy @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the capacitance between the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and the dot can be neglected .",
    "there are two limits in which a mapping to a kondo hamiltonian can be used to calculate the charge on the quantum dot .",
    "these two limits roughly correspond to the cases of very strong and very weak reflection at the qpc . before elaborating on this point",
    "we will here give the standard multi - channel kondo hamiltonian @xmath4\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a very general form to be used as a point of reference for later discussions@xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is an impurity spin and @xmath6 is the spin of conduction electrons with flavor @xmath7 at the place of the impurity .",
    "we will consider only the two - channel case @xmath8 . in the discussion of the coulomb blockade problem",
    "we will encounter kondo hamiltonians which are both spin- ( @xmath9 ) and channel - anisotropic ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "a large quantum dot is coupled to a 2deg via a quantum point contact .",
    "the number of electrons in the dot can be controlled through the gate voltage @xmath1 .",
    "the auxiliary voltage @xmath11 can be used to open or close the point contact and thus to adjust the reflection amplitudes for the transport channels in the qpc.,title=\"fig : \" ] 0.3 cm    we now want to return to the original problem and first want to discuss the limit of weak tunneling between the dot and the reservoir ( strong reflection at the qpc ) . for low enough temperatures ( @xmath12 ) the charge on the dot is quantized . when the gate voltage @xmath1 is increased the charge on the dot changes in a step - like manner .",
    "this behavior is referred to as a coulomb staircase .",
    "charge fluctuations are important only for those values of the gate voltage at which two neighboring charge states ( e.g. with @xmath13 and @xmath14 electrons on the dot ) are energy degenerate .",
    "matveev demonstrated the equivalence of the effective hamiltonian describing the charge dynamics close to such a degeneracy point to a spin - anisotropic kondo hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "if the dot and the reservoir are connected by @xmath15 transport channels with the same transmission probability the problem can be mapped on a channel - isotropic m - channel kondo model @xcite with @xmath16 and @xmath17@xcite .",
    "the similarity of the charge dynamics on the dot to the spin dynamics in a kondo model was already observed by glazman and matveev in there discussion on the conductance of a metallic grain ( a quantum dot ) tunnel - coupled to two reservoirs@xcite .    the limit of a point contact with one ( electrons without spin ) or two ( electrons with spin ) transport channels close to perfect transmission has also been treated .",
    "an effectively one - dimensional model for the dot - qpc system , which makes it possible to calculate the total charge on the dot using bosonization , was developed by flensberg@xcite and by matveev@xcite .",
    "matveev@xcite also calculated the dot s capacitance as a function of the gate voltage and the reflection amplitude at the point contact . in his calculation",
    "he demonstrated that the hamiltonian of the original problem can be mapped onto a kondo hamiltonian in the generalized toulouse limit ( @xmath18 ) . in this limit",
    "the two - channel kondo model is exactly solvable as was shown by emery and kivelson@xcite .",
    "it was one of the main results of ref .",
    "that coulomb blockade oscillations ( accompanied by a logarithmic singularity in the expressions for the charge or the capacitance close to `` half - integer '' values of the number of electrons in the dot ) persist also in the limit of weak reflection , as recently checked experimentally by berman et al.@xcite .",
    "they are completely smeared out only if at least one transport channel is at perfect transmission , the charge in the dot then increases linearly with the gate voltage @xcite . a review of these results and more generally of interaction effects in quantum dots can be found in ref .  .",
    "extending our previous work@xcite we here want to discuss the effect of a _ channel - anisotropy _ on the results for the capacitance in the two limits of almost perfect transmission and almost total reflection discussed above .",
    "we will show that the coulomb staircase behavior is smeared out by a small channel anisotropy both in the weak and strong reflection limit .",
    "we will concentrate on the case of two transport channels .",
    "channel - anisotropy then means that the reflection ( or transmission ) amplitudes for the two channels are different .",
    "such a situation can be realized applying a magnetic field to the sample .",
    "a weak in - plane magnetic field leads to different reflection amplitudes for spin - up and spin - down electrons . in a strong magnetic field electrons",
    "are spin polarized and the number of open channels in the qpc and their respective reflection amplitudes depend on the opening of the qpc .",
    "the confinement potential at the qpc and thus its opening can be tuned changing the auxiliary gate voltage @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ dot ] ) . in the limit of small reflection an intuitive physical picture for the transition from the channel symmetric case@xcite to the case of a weak asymmetry between the two channels",
    "can be obtained @xcite from the use of the _ channel - anisotropic _ two - channel kondo model at the emery - kivelson line @xcite .",
    "this model has also been investigated in ref .  .",
    "the two coupling constants of the asymmetric kondo model are directly related to the reflection amplitudes of the two transport channels in the qpc . in this paper",
    "we will elaborate on this mapping and discuss its limitations .",
    "although the physical picture associated with the _ channel - anisotropic _ two - channel kondo model is very appealing , the coulomb blockade problem in the high transparency limit with two transport channels with different reflection coefficients can also be solved through a mapping on the _ channel - isotropic _ two - channel kondo model as we will show .",
    "such a procedure was applied by matveev and furusaki@xcite when they calculated the inelastic cotunneling through a quantum dot strongly coupled to two quantum point contacts with one transport channel each ( electrons in a strong magnetic field ) .",
    "we will see furthermore that in the case of tunnel - coupling ( small transmission ) an asymmetry between transmission amplitudes of different channels will lead to a mapping of the hamiltonian on a channel - anisotropic kondo model with ( @xmath19 .",

    "we introduce the channel index @xmath24 and we denote the wave - function of an electron in this channel by @xmath25 . in the further analysis we neglect transport channels that are totally reflected at the qpc , since electrons from these channels are confined to the reservoir and will not contribute to the charging of the dot .",
    "we will concentrate on the case where only two channels are open .",
    "this can be realized in two different ways . if a weak ( or zero ) in - plane magnetic field is applied ( see sec .",
    "[ anisotropic ] ) , the two channels correspond to the two spin polarizations of electrons in the lowest ( @xmath26 ) energy eigenstate of the lateral hamiltonian ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the role of the magnetic field is to introduce an asymmetry between the reflection coefficients for spin - up and spin - down electrons @xcite . in a strong magnetic field",
