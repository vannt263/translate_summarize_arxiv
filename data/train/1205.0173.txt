    "as tumors seriously threaten human health , extensive attention has been paid to this issue by researchers in various fields@xcite .",
    "it is known that tumor cell growth is a complex process , and is governed by environmental fluctuations such as the people s spiritual status , as well as other diseases from which they suffer .",
    "recently , researchers from the field of nonlinear physics have introduced noise into the model of tumor cell growth , where @xmath0 refers to the various disturbances involved in tumor growth .",
    "for example , ai and coworkers@xcite studied the effects of correlated gaussian white noise in a logistic growth model .",
    "this model is often as a basic model for cell growth , particularly tumor cell growth@xcite , to describe such growth under ideal conditions without fluctuation .",
    "ai and coworkers found that noise during tumor cell growth can induce phase transition , and that intensive environmental fluctuations may even cause the extinction of tumor cells .",
    "furthermore , zhong and coworkers@xcite investigated the random resonance of tumor growth with noise .",
    "it was found that the steady distribution probability of tumor growth changed from a uni - peak state to a bi - peak state when the intensity of multiplicative noise increased .",
    "an appropriate intensity of multiplicative noise can destroy the mechanism of tumor growth .",
    "in contrast , superfluous noise can be beneficial for their growth .",
    "mei and coworkers@xcite investigated the tumor cell growth model in the presence of correlated noises and found that the correlation intensity @xmath1 and correlation time @xmath2 play opposite roles in the static properties and the state transition of the system .",
    "an increase in @xmath1 can produce a smaller mean value of the cell population and slow down the state transition .",
    "however , an increase in @xmath2 can produce a larger mean value of the cell population and enhance the state transition .",
    "+ the abovementioned results demonstrate that tumor growth models with noise are closer to the real situation , although most models exhibit some differences from the real process of tumor growth . in such studies ,",
    "researchers have attempted to obtain deeper insights into the intrinsic mechanisms of tumor growth and provide new ideas for tumor treatment .",
    "+ the noises introduced into the tumor growth model are generally a single noise , correlated multiplicative noise@xcite , etc .",
    "it has been shown that different types and numbers of noise may be operating in the context of tumor growth@xcite , and the corresponding tumor growth behaviors have also been observed to be different .",
    "the random fluctuations introduced in our study are different from those in previous studies . in this paper",
    ", the effects of two uncorrelated gaussian white noises on tumor growth will be studied .",
    "these are the effect of additive noise on the birth rate of tumor cells and that of multiplicative noise on the predation rate of anticancer cells .",
    "it is shown that the effect of noise on the tumor growth is mainly determined by the predation rate of anticancer cells . with changes in the parameters , the steady distribution probability of tumor growth changes between a single steady state and bi - stable state .",
    "lefever and garay@xcite studied tumor growth under immune surveillance against cancer using the enzyme dynamics model .",
    "the model is as follows :    normal cells @xmath3 @xmath4 ,    @xmath4 @xmath3 @xmath5 ,    @xmath4 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath3 @xmath8 @xmath3 @xmath7 + @xmath9 ,    @xmath9 @xmath3 ,    here , @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are cancer cells , dead cancer cells , immune cells , and the compounds of cancer cells and immune cells , respectively .",
    "this model reveals that normal cells can transform into cancer cells , and then the cancer cells reproduce , decline , and ultimately die out .",
    "+ based on the model by lefever and garay , we investigate the logistic model of verhulst , and only consider the growth of tumor cells and anticancer cells .",
    "we assume that tumor cells satisfy the following equation[31,32 ] : @xmath10 where @xmath4 is the relative number of tumor cells , @xmath11 is the birth rate of the tumor cells , and @xmath12 is carrying capacity .",
    "@xmath13 represents predation generated by anticancer cells .",
    "we take the @xmath13 expression suggested by ludwing[31 ] . in his work @xmath13",
    "is expressed by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a positive constant and @xmath16 represents the predation rate of the anticancer cells .",
    "+ as we do not intend to investigate the constant @xmath15 , it was concealed in the model for the convenience of discussion .",
    "the transformation parameters can be given by @xcite : @xmath17 and by substituting this into eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we obtain : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the tumor cell growth rate and @xmath20 is the predation rate of anticancer cells . by letting @xmath21 , we can obtain the steady states of the system from the eq .",
    "( 3 ) . clearly",
    ", one of the solutions is @xmath22 , while the other solutions satisfy : @xmath23 when @xmath19 varies and keeps @xmath20 and @xmath24 constant , the number of solutions ( namely equilibria ) changes between one and three@xcite .",
    "the range with three solutions changes with the values of @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "this also occurs for a variable @xmath20 ( or @xmath24 ) and fixed @xmath19 and @xmath24 ( or @xmath20 ) .",
    "+ based on eq .",
    "( 3 ) ( let @xmath25 ) , we can draw the curves of @xmath26 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for a curve with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath29 are unstable states , since @xmath30 at @xmath22 , @xmath31 .",
    "however , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are stable steady states since @xmath34 at these two points .     + in fig .",
    "1 , when @xmath19 decreases or @xmath20 increases , the solutions @xmath31 and @xmath33 will disappear and only the stable state @xmath32 on the left side can be observed ( e.g. the curve for @xmath27 , @xmath35 ) . in contrast , when @xmath19 increases or @xmath20 decreases , only the stable state @xmath33 on the right side can be observed ( as shown in fig .",
    "2 ) . clearly",
    ", @xmath32 is the refuge equilibrium , while @xmath33 is the outbreak equilibrium . from a tumor control point of view",
    ", we need to keep the number of tumor cells in the refuge state rather than allowing it to reach an outbreak situation .",
    "+    when considering the noise , the range of three equilibria is also related to the noises .",
    "similarly , the equilibrium state changes between 1 and 3 by varying the parameters .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to investigate them by using the steady probability distribution function(spdf ) .",
    "equation ( 3 ) only describes the tumor growth behavior under ideal conditions , without fluctuation .",
    "when considering a real situation , external environmental disturbances such as the individual s state of health , body temperature , and other disease may affect tumor growth .",
    "in addition , artificial behavior like chemotherapy may also have an effect .",
    "because of these external disturbances , the growth rate of tumor cells and the predation rate of anticancer cells may vary greatly . in our work ,",
    "the effects of additive noise on the birth rate of tumor cell and multiplicative noise on the predation rate of anticancer cells are further considered .",
    "hence the tumor growth equation considering external disturbances can be rewritten as : + @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are gaussian white noises .",
    "they have the following properties : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the strength of the noises @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . from this",
    ", we can derive the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the evolution of spdf based on eq .",
    "( 5 ) and eq . (",
    "the equation is as follows [ 11 ] : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability of the relative numbers of tumor cells , and : @xmath44 @xmath45^{2}+d.\\ ] ] +",
    "usually , what we are concerned with is the steady state . for eq .",

    "( 8) , ( 9 ) , and ( 12 ) together , we can obtain : @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 + equation ( 11 ) is the main result in this study . based on this equation",
    ", we can plot the figures and obtain the curves for @xmath65 , @xmath19 , @xmath41 , @xmath20 , and @xmath40 . in this way",
    ", we can determine the mechanisms of tumor growth model .",
    "in order to discuss the effects of the fluctuation on the steady probability distribution ( spd ) of tumor growth , it is necessary to discuss the relationships between @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the condition to obtain the extremum of spdf is : @xmath67 by considering eqs .",
    "( 8) , ( 9 ) , and ( 27 ) together , we can obtain : @xmath68 based on eq .",
    "( 28 ) , we can draw the curves of @xmath19 - @xmath66 and @xmath20 - @xmath66 in fig . 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3 , when @xmath69 , one value of @xmath19 ( @xmath70 ) corresponds to three values of @xmath66 with a fixed @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "that is , the spdf of tumor growth will exhibit two peaks ( corresponding to the three solutions , namely the two stable steady states in the section 2 ) if @xmath19 is in that range . for different values of @xmath40 ( or @xmath20 ) , the curves almost overlap with each other , except in the position around @xmath71 .",
    "this demonstrates that only when @xmath66 is around 1 can we observe the difference of @xmath19 for different values of @xmath40 ( or @xmath20 ) .",
    "+     + similarly , adopting @xmath27 in fig . 4",
    ", one value of @xmath20 ( @xmath72 ) corresponds to three values of @xmath66 .",
    "the range of the two peaks is different with different @xmath19 values . + as eq .",
    "( 28 ) is irrelevant to @xmath41 , the ranges of the two peaks is mainly determined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned ranges , for smaller or larger values of @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) , each curve has only one peak ( mono - stability ) .",
    "this corresponds to the situation shown in the section 2 , but there are four parameters here(@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath24 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "+ it is clear that the spd of tumor growth switches between bi - stability and mono - stability when the parameter @xmath19 changes . as shown in fig . 5 ,",
    "the positions of the peaks vary with the different @xmath19 values . for a small @xmath19 value ,",
    "there is only one peak on the left side , which represents a small quantity of tumor cells in healthy people or the annihilation of tumor cells . with the increase of @xmath19 value , two peaks can be observed . with a further increase in the @xmath19 value ,",
    "the peak number is again reduced to one and its position shifts to the right side , indicating the steady growth of the tumor cells . comparing the growth behaviors under different @xmath19 values",
    ", it can be concluded that a large value of @xmath19 is favorable for tumor cell growth .",
    "+     +     + fig .",
    "6 shows the effects of the @xmath20 value on the tumor growth . with the increase of the @xmath20 value , the number of peaks on the curve changes from one to two , and finally back to one",
    "it is clear that a large predation rate is unfavorable for tumor growth .",
    "+      figure 7 shows the effects of @xmath41 on tumor growth for a small @xmath20 value ( e.g. @xmath73 ) . when the value of @xmath41 increases , the peak intensity of the probability density decreases , which demonstrates that an increase in @xmath41 is unfavorable for tumor growth . +    in the case of a large @xmath20 value ( e.g. @xmath74 ) , the peak position shifts to the left side , as shown in fig .",
    "when the @xmath41 value increases , the spd of tumor cells moves to the more positive @xmath66 direction .",
    "when healthy people receive chemotherapy , normal tissue cells and anticancer cells may be killed rather than tumor cells .",
    "therefore , in such a case , chemotherapy is favorable for tumor growth ( although there is usually a small quantity of tumor cells in healthy people , they can be controlled by the immunity of the human body ) . + it",
    "can thus be concluded that @xmath20 plays a very important role in tumor growth , especially if @xmath20 is very small or very large , while @xmath40 is less important for the tumor growth . in a real situation",
    ", the magnitude of the predation rate can determine the body s anticancer ability .",
    "+    for a moderate @xmath20 value , for example @xmath75 , there are two peaks for all the @xmath41 values , as shown in fig . 9 and 10 . for a fixed @xmath20 ,",
    "the spdf curve becomes flatter with an increase in @xmath41 .",
    "the noise interferes with the tumor growth as well as the predation rate of anticancer cells .",
    "for example , by using chemotherapy , tumor cells may be extinguished . at the same time , normal tissue cells and anticancer cells may also be damaged . here , whether or not the increase of @xmath41 is favorable for tumor growth is determined by @xmath40 . for a small value of @xmath40 , as shown in fig . 9 ( @xmath76 ) ,",
    "the intensity of the right peak decreases with an increase in @xmath41 , which means that it is unfavorable for tumor growth .",
    "in contrast , for a large value of @xmath40 , as shown in fig .",
    "10 ( @xmath77 , even though the intensities of two peaks decrease at the same time , the spd of tumor cells moves to the more positive direction of @xmath66 .",
    "that is , when @xmath40 is larger , interference with the anticancer cells is dominant . thus , the increase of @xmath41 in the case of a larger @xmath40 when @xmath20 is a middle value is favorable for tumor growth .",
    "+    for a different value of @xmath19 , for example , @xmath78 , the results indicate that the laws acting on @xmath65 and @xmath41 are same as that of @xmath27 .",
    "however , the range of the two peaks is different . if the curves for @xmath27 shift to the more positive direction of @xmath20 , they can nearly overlap with the curves for @xmath78 . for example ,",
    "11 is almost same to fig . 9 , except that the relevant @xmath20 value ( 2.72 ) is higher by around 0.46 larger than that for @xmath27 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "this means that the laws of tumor growth are similar even with a different tumor growth rate .",
    "+      different values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 are adopted in this study .",
    "the corresponding results show that the effects of fluctuations on @xmath20 are similar to those on @xmath19 . for a small value of @xmath20 , an increase in @xmath40",
    "is unfavorable for tumor growth . for a large value of @xmath20 , on the other hand , an increase in @xmath40",
    "is favorable for tumor growth .",
    "this effect is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "however , for a moderate value of @xmath20 , whether or not the noise is favorable for tumor growth is determined by @xmath41 . for a small value of @xmath41 , interference with @xmath20",
    "is dominant ; this is favorable for tumor growth . in contrast",
    ", large values of @xmath41 are unfavorable for tumor growth . if @xmath19 is changed , the laws are same as those mentioned above , but the corresponding @xmath20 will be different .",
    "this is also similar to the effects of the fluctuation of @xmath19 .",
    "we investigated the effects of the environmental disturbances on tumor cell growth . by solving the corresponding fokker - planck equation",
    ", we obtained analytic expressions of the steady state probability distribution of tumor cells .",
    "it was found that the effects of noise on the tumor growth are mainly determined by the predation rate @xmath20 : ( 1 ) for a small value of @xmath20 , the effects of the disturbance on tumor growth and anticancer cells are unfavorable for tumor growth ; ( 2 ) a large value of @xmath20 is favorable for tumor growth .",
    "( 3 ) for a moderate value of @xmath20 , the effect is determined by the fluctuation in the relative strength of the two noises : ( a ) if the fluctuation strength of the predation rate @xmath40 is small , the increase of the tumor growth rate fluctuation intensity @xmath41 is unfavorable for tumor growth ; in contrast , it is favorable for tumor growth if @xmath40 is large ; ( b ) if @xmath41 is small , increasing @xmath40 is favorable for the tumor growth ; in contrast , decreasing @xmath40 is unfavorable for tumor growth .",
