    "metallic and oxidic nanoparticles have been the subject of intense studies in recent decades because of their catalytic activity.@xcite for example , gold becomes an active catalyst for oxidation reactions when divided down to the nanoscale.@xcite titania nanoparticles are also highly active catalysts@xcite and there is a large number of other nanometric systems with promising catalytic properties.@xcite use in catalytic reaction requires a simple and secure handling of nanoparticles by a suitable macromolecular carrier system , in particular when working in solution .",
    "such a carrier system should not impede the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles but keep them firmly stabilized throughout the reaction and the subsequent work - up .",
    "reactants should also be able to quickly enter and leave the carrier .",
    "a catalytic system thus defined acts in many ways as a nanoreactor , that is , it contains and shelters the catalytic reaction .",
    "examples of these nanoreactors are given , e.g. , by dendrimeric systems@xcite or those based on spherical polyelectrolyte brushes.@xcite    in recent years , a new class of carrier systems is emerging that can be termed active nanoreactors.@xcite here the nanoparticles are embedded in a polymer gel that reacts to external stimuli . in solution , diffusion within the gel may be manipulated by parameters such as temperature or ph .",
    "the best - studied examples of such active carriers are colloidal gels made from crosslinked poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) that undergo a volume phase transition at 32@xmath2c .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles embedded in such gels can be manipulated using temperature as the external stimulus.@xcite    in particular , a simple model system has been prepared by enclosing a single gold nanoparticles in a hollow pnipam sphere , a so - called yolk - shell architecture.@xcite this active carrier in aqueous phase provides the ideal means to investigate the manipulation of the activity of a nanoparticle in a stimuli - responsive nanoreactor .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the reactivity of the nanoparticle can be switched depending on the hydrophilicity of the reactants.@xcite these findings open a new way to introduce selectivity into the catalysis with nanoparticles .",
    "another model system , introduced by liz - marzn and co - workers @xcite , is made up by a single gold particle embedded in the middle of a colloidal pnipam sphere , a core - shell architecture .",
    "for this system , carregal - romero _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated that the reduction of hexacyanoferrate ( iii ) ions by sodium borohydride is slowed down drastically above the temperature of the volume transition , that is , when the gel has shrunken and most of the water has been expelled.@xcite these workers explained this decrease of the rate constant by the decrease in the reactant s diffusion coefficient in the gel in its dense , collapsed state using a two - state model for the gel . in this way carregal - romero _ et al .",

    "_ called attention on the fact that the thermodynamic interaction of the reactants with the pnipam network must be considered in this case , and used the debye - smoluchowski theory of diffusion on an energy landscape,@xcite to explain the observed results .    here",

    "the predictions of this model are compared to recent experimental data for both yolk - shell @xcite and core - shell@xcite systems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : first , in the theory section we present a step - by - step derivation of our model , carefully stating its underlying assumptions .",
    "we then perform in the discussion section a parameter study to highlight the effects of the various parameters in the model , and discuss the main predicted trends providing a comparison with available experimental data .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion will wrap up all results .",
    "we start with the rate equation describing a chemical reaction of first order : @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the concentration of reactants in solution , and @xmath5 is the experimental rate constant . by using a microscopic description",
    "we will arrive at an expression for the number of reactants transformed _ by one _ nanoreactor per unit time _ at a constant bulk density @xmath6 _ , ending up with an equation of the form :    @xmath7    in order to connect @xmath5 and @xmath0 , one needs to assume that nanoreactors do not interact with each other and can be treated independently ( i.e. , we can use a cell model , as explained in more details elsewhere@xcite ) . given",
    "that under relevant experimental settings low nanoreactors concentrations are used , this condition should be typically satisfied . within this approximation :    @xmath8    leading to @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the total number of nanoreactors present in a volume @xmath11 of solution .",
    "eq.([eq : k - exp2 ] ) provides a link from the rate @xmath5 typically used to describe experiments and the microscopic rate at which nanoreactors transform reactants .",
    "+ since the reaction catalyzed by the nanoparticle takes place directly on its surface , the reaction rate per total surface area of catalyst ( i.e. , total nanoparticle surface area ) and per volume of solution @xcite is necessary to compare different systems in an unbiased manner , hence :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is now the surface area of a single nanoparticle inside the nanoreactor . via eq.([eq : k - exp3 ] ) , we see how this latter normalized rate constant @xmath14 is truly an intensive measure of the properties of a single - nanoreactor , and is the quantity that should be used for comparison within different systems .",
    "we next proceed to describe our microscopic model for the calculations of @xmath0 .          a schematic representation of a yolk - shell nanoreactor is shown in fig.[fig : system ] .",
    "for such a spherically symmetric system , we intend to model the rate for the catalytic reaction occurring at the surface of the nanoparticle , which requires taking into account the diffusion process that brings a reactant from the bulk solvent to the surface of the nanoparticle inside the nanoreactor s core.@xcite the kinetics of this process is governed by two key functions , the diffusion coefficient of the reactants along the trajectory expressed by a diffusivity profile @xmath15 and a thermodynamic free enthalpy of solvation profile @xmath16 .",
    "this local free enthalpy @xmath16measures the difference in the local excess chemical potential and the reservoir chemical potential of the reactants far away from the nanoreactor . along its trajectory",
    ", the reactant encounters a different chemical environment in the gel , and its average interaction with it then results in local @xmath15 and @xmath16different than in bulk .    in order to keep the model as simple as possible , we take both @xmath15 and @xmath16to be a step function centered in the polymer cage of the nanoreactor , of width equal to the shell width @xmath17 ( see fig.[fig : system ] for reference ) .",
    "this is a good approximation for spatially homogeneous gels that have been under consideration recently.@xcite thus , we get : @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20is the inner radius of the polymer shell and @xmath17 its width , cf .",
    "the choice of step functions basically implies that a reactant sees only two distinct environments , the interior of the polymer shell or the bulk solution .",
    "hence , in this form , @xmath1can be identified with the difference in the solvation free enthalpy of the reactants in the gel with respect to that in the bulk solvent . as such , @xmath1does",
    "not depend solely on the reactant - polymer interaction , but also on the solvent constituting the bulk solution . by measuring the equilibrium partitioning coefficient of the molecule in the gel",

    "the diffusion of solutes through hydrogels is a complex process@xcite and depends not only on the individual properties of the polymer , solvent , and solutes , such as size and concentration , but also on the particular interactions of the solute with the polymer network . in our case ,",
    "we restrict the discussion to homogeneous gels with semiflexible polymers in the dilute and semi - dilute regimes with very small diffusing solutes with a size comparable to a polymer monomer . in this case",
    "obstruction or hydrodynamic theories for small diffusing particles should better describe our problem.@xcite regardless , the important point we want to emphasize is that all theoretical approaches to the diffusion process in our regimes predict a _ decrease _ of diffusion for higher packing fractions .",
    "the detailed dependence of @xmath26 on the system parameters is thus not of importance to discuss the qualitative features of the temperature dependence of the reaction rate of nanoreactors .",
    "once the diffusivity profile and the underlying free enthalpy on which the diffusing reactant must move to reach the surface of the nanoparticle are specified , it is possible to use an approach , initially developed by smoluchowski @xcite and then extended by debye , @xcite to calculate the diffusion - controlled part of the reaction rate in our system .",
    "this approach was first used to describe the rate of collision between charged ions in solution,@xcite but the underlying physical picture is equivalent to our model . for the reader",
    "s convenience we provide a step - by - step derivation of the final equations in the supplementary information , and we also suggest to consult the reviews of calef and deutch @xcite and berg and von hippel @xcite on diffusion - controlled reactions .",
    "the debye - smoluchowski model describes the rate at which a particle , driven by gradients in the chemical potential , diffuse from a bulk solution kept at constant concentration @xmath28 towards a fixed sink of radius @xmath29 .",
    "close to the sink , a certain number per unit time of the molecules arriving are allowed to absorb ( react ) as expressed by a surface reaction rate constant @xmath30 .",
    "restated in our language , the sink is nothing but the nanoparticle inside the nanoreactor , and absorption into the sink means reacting in the proximity of the nanoparticle s surface .",

    "+ before we conclude , let us now briefly discuss the main limitation of our model . since we treat the reaction within the debye picture , the polymer cage simply acts as a _ fixed _ , external field for the diffusing reactant . a more complete description instead would account for the fact that the state of the polymer , e.g. its local density , will adapt to the presence of the diffusing specie .",
    "although description of the reaction kinetics including such a coupling is possible using techniques such as ( classical ) dynamic density functional theory @xcite or coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulations , the intrinsic complication arising in this more complex case would make the problem analytically intractable , and one would need to resort to numerical calculations .",

    "<S> metallic nanoparticles embedded in stimuli - responsive polymers can be regarded as nanoreactors since their catalytic activity can be changed within wide limits : the physicochemical properties of the polymer network can be tuned and switched by external parameters , e.g. temperature or ph , and thus allows a selective control of reactant mobility and concentration close to the reaction site . </S>",
    "<S> based on a combination of debye s model of diffusion through an energy landscape and a two - state model for the polymer , here we develop an analytical expression for the observed reaction rate constant @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our formula shows an exponential dependence of this rate on the solvation free enthalpy change @xmath1 , a quantity which describes the partitioning of the reactant in the network versus bulk . </S>",
    "<S> thus , changes in @xmath1 , and not in the diffusion coefficient , will be the decisive factor affecting the reaction rate in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with recent experimental data on switchable , thermosensitive nanoreactors demonstrates the general validity of the concept . </S>"
