    "tin sulphide ( sns ) is formed from elements belonging to the iv - vi group of the periodic table @xcite . like other sulphide compounds ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 _ etc . _ ) , sns too attracted attention in the 1970 and 1980 s for possible application as an optical storage medium @xcite .",
    "however , recent investigations are directed towards studying its potential as a photovolatic or solar cell essentially due to its high absorption coefficient , low cost and low toxicity @xcite .",
    "a pertinent point is that both applications require sns to be in its thin film state .",
    "being a layered chalcogenide @xcite of relatively low melting point @xcite , sns has been found to be a suitable candidate for thin film fabrication .",
    "depending on film thickness , the color of sns films varies from orange to brown when viewed in transmission .",
    "thus , the last 30 - 40 years has seen substantial work in fabrication of sns thin films using various methods like thermal evaporation @xcite , rf sputtering @xcite , chemical vapor deposition @xcite , electrodeposition @xcite and spray pyrolysis @xcite .",
    "the reported optical band - gap of sns films lies between 1.1 - 2.1  ev @xcite depending on the fabrication method used .",
    "while there are large number of reports on sns , more systematic studies should be undertaken considering its potential commercial application as a solar cell . especially to understand why the band - gap of sns varies so much . with this intention ,",
    "we have carried out systematic studies on sns thin films of varying thicknesses grown by thermal evaporation .",
    "the structural , morphological , compositional and optical properties of the films are reported here .",
    "the role of the intra - planar forces in the layer structured ( as seen from the lattice parameters of unit cells within the nano - crystalline sns grains ) and the grain size on the band - gap of the films have been discussed .",
    "sns thin films of varying thickness were grown on glass substrates maintained at room temperature by thermal evaporation at vacuum better than @xmath3  torr . a hind high vac ( 12a4d ) ,",
    "bengaluru thermal evaporation coating unit was used for the thermal evaporation process .",
    "sns powder of 99% purity supplied by himedia ( mumbai ) was used as the starting material .",
    "the thicknesses of the as grown films were then measured by a veeco dektak surface profiler ( 150 ) .",
    "the standard structural , morphological and optical characterization of the films were done using bruker d8 diffractometer ( in the @xmath4 mode ) , renishaw invia raman microscope , field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( fe - sem fei - quanta 200f ) and systronics uv - vis double beam spectrophotometer ( 2202 ) .",
    "chemical composition of the films were determined using kratos axis ultra dld s x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) with @xmath5 target .",
    "the x - ray diffractograms of very thin sns films ( thickness less than 150  nm ) were unmarked with a hump between ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 .",
    "the absence of peaks suggests that the samples were not crystalline .",
    "this is not surprising since chalcogenides grown at room temperature are usually amorphous in nature .",
    "however , the hump indicates that there might be some short range order among the atoms .",
    "as the sample thickness increases ( 270  nm and above ) , a small diffraction peak emerges on the hump around @xmath8 .",
    "thus , it would appear that ordering increases with increasing film thickness .",
    "fig  ( 1a ) shows the x - ray diffraction patterns of samples of different thicknesses .",
    "the peak positions matched with those reported in astm card no .",
    "83 - 1758 implying an orthorhombic unit cell structure with lattice parameters of 4.148 , 11.48 and 4.177   .",
    "the standard relationship @xcite was used to determine the lattice parameters using the peak positions @xmath9 the lattice parameters ` b ' and ` c ' were found to be @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the lattice parameters were found to remain constant with increasing film thickness within experimental error ( fig  1b ) .",
    "fig  ( 1b ) however , shows an initial decreasing trend of lattice parameter ` a ' with increasing film thickness .",
    "however , for film thicknesses greater than 600  nm , there is no tensile stress acting on the films and ` a ' remains constant .",
    "fig  2 is a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) image of a 480  nm thick film .",
    "the image clearly shows the layered nature of the sns films .",
    "the interplanar distances was found to be 2.45 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this would mean the films are oriented with the ( 040 ) plane lying parallel to the substrate .",
    "the oriented nature of the films is also seen in the xrd patterns with the ( 040 ) peak standing out as the most intense peak in agreement with observations reported @xcite .",
    "the x - ray diffraction peak s full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) gives the grain size using scherrer formula @xcite .",
    "fig  ( 3 ) shows a linear relationship between the average grain size and film thickness .",
    "the raman spectra of sns thin films were collected using argon laser in back scattering mode .",
    "the laser power ( 15  mw ) , exposure time ( 30  sec ) and beam area were maintained constant for all the samples . since sns is known to show changes induced by photo - thermal absorption of light @xcite , all the raman spectra were collected using low power laser .",
    "the nano - crystalline samples showed three prominent peaks which were consistently present in all the samples ( fig  4 ) in varying proportions around @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , each sample showed slight displacement in peak position compared to those reported for single crystal raman peaks @xcite .",
    "the consensus in literature is that the @xmath16 peak indicates existence of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this may have resulted due to the growth technique , since starting material s raman does not exhibit peak at @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 contribution decreases with thickness as is evident from the decreasing @xmath16 peak intensity and area with increasing film thickness .",
    "this was also confirmed by the chemical composition analysis done on the films of different thicknesses using x - ray photo - electron spectroscopy ( xps ) .",
    "fig  5 compares the xps peaks of sulphur and tin for 270 and 600  nm thicknesses .",
    "the 600  nm thick sample had lone sulphur 2p and tin @xmath18 peaks that could not be deconvoluted .",
    "the number of sulphur ( @xmath19 ) and tin atoms ( @xmath20 ) in bonding per @xmath21 area can be evaluated using the area under the curve ( @xmath22 ) and cross - sectional values ( @xmath23 ) @xcite in the standard formula @xcite @xmath24 the ratio of sulphur to tin in this sample was found to be @xmath25 , suggesting within experimental error that the 600  nm sample is of sns . however , in comparison with this , the 270  nm sample s sulphur ( 2p ) and tin ( @xmath18 ) peaks can be deconvoluted into two peaks . based on the raman results , we associate the major peaks with sns and the minor ones with @xmath17 . using the above mentioned formula and area under the curves ,",
    "the ratio of s / sn from the major peaks give 1.1 while from the minor peaks @xmath26 .",
    "thus , thin samples ( 270  nm and 480  nm ) have both species of sns and @xmath17 . from the ratio of two tin peaks",
    ", we may say only @xmath27 of the film is @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath28 peak or the @xmath29 peak is associated with interaction along the inter - layer ` b ' axis @xcite while the @xmath30 peak is the symmetric sn - s bond s stretching mode ( @xmath31 ) @xcite . as the film thickness increases , the position of these two peaks shifts ( fig  6 shows the variation ) .",
    "initially , the peak position of @xmath32 was found to decrease with increasing film thickness , however , after 600  nm the peak position remained fixed @xmath33 .",
    "the region of saturation corresponds to where samples have constant lattice parameters .",
    "hence , we believe that the peak position of @xmath31 is intimately related to the lattice size . a plot between @xmath31 and ` a ' ( fig  6a ) confirms a linear relation between the two .",
    "an increase in wave - number ( vibration frequency ) marks the increase in restoring force ( bond strength ) .",
    "hence , the results suggest that increasing tensile stress along ` a ' direction is accompanied with increased restoring force acting between the tin and sulphur atom .",
    "fig  6 exhibits the variation in @xmath29 peak position with film thickness .",
    "this shows a monotonous decrease with film thickness .",
    "shift in raman peak position may also be related to grain size @xcite-@xcite and nature of defect on the grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "fig  ( 7b ) plots @xmath29 peak position with respect to the grain size .",
    "we find that the plot conforms to results of zhu _ et al _ @xcite where a shift to lower wave numbers takes place with increasing grain size .",
    "as reported , sns are layered compounds with layers formed by ` sn ' and ` s ' zig - zagged molecules .",
    "these layers arrange themselves normal to the ` b ' axis with weak van der - waal  inter - planar \" forces acting between them .",
    "the layers themselves , due to this zig - zagging , have finite thickness with strong  intra - planar \" forces acting within it .",
    "if any stress acts along the ` b ' axis , the  inter - planar \" distances vary with no effect on the  intra - planar \" distances @xcite .",
    "variation in grain size seems to effect ",
    "inter - planar \" distances , thus effecting @xmath29 peak position .",
    "increased grain size is accompanied with lower raman wave - numbers and hence indicate lower restoring forces , which from our above analysis on @xmath34 , would imply lattice constant ` b ' would decrease with increasing grain size .",
    "however , the variation in ` b ' ( @xmath35 ) as seen from x - ray diffraction results ) is too small to justify this comment .      fig  ( 8) shows representative sem images of sns as grown films of different thicknesses , namely 150 , 480 , 600 and 900  nm .",
    "the grain morphologies are similar to those reported earlier @xcite . in the case of the thicker films ( 480 , 600 and 900  nm )",
    ", the morphology of the films appear very similar to each other , with noticeable increase in grain density with increasing film thickness . however , the morphology of the 150  nm thick film is distinctly different consisting spherical grains . as discussed above , raman spectra",
    "( fig  4 ) and xps analysis clearly shows that this sample contains @xmath17 .",
    "this should explain the distinctly different morphology of this sample from the remaining samples .",
    "though results related to this sample have not been used in this present study , we have included its sem to show very thin films are dominated with @xmath17 marked by spherical grains .",
    "grains of these morphology are absent in samples with thicknesses greater than 250  nm , highlighting , no or negligible contribution by @xmath17 in these samples .",
    "the absorption spectra of as grown sns films with varying thicknesses were obtained between 300 and 1100  nm at room temperature .",
    "the band - gaps were evaluated using the absorption coefficient ` @xmath36 ' obtained from the uv - visible spectra using standard formula @xcite @xmath37 where ` a ' and ` t ' are the film s absorbance and thickness respectively .",
    "the band - gap of the films can be evaluated from this information .",
    "sns is reported to have both indirect @xcite and direct band - gap @xcite .",
    "band - gaps are usually evaluated using tauc s method @xcite where a graph between @xmath38 is plot with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the linear region of this plot is extrapolated to intersect the ` x'-axis at y=0 .",
    "the point of intersection gives the band - gap of the material .",
    "for direct allowed transitions , the absorption coefficient is related to the photon energy by equation @xcite-@xcite @xmath40 where ` k ' is the proportionality constant .",
    "fig  ( 9 ) shows the variation of the band - gap with grain size .",
    "the 270 and 480  nm thin films have a considerably large band - gap .",
    "while one may suspect this to be due to the existence of @xmath17 in these samples , it should be noted that only @xmath41 of the sample is @xmath17 .",
    "they are predominantly sns films . also , the linear trends shown in fig  7(a ) and ( b ) argue little or no significant contributions are made by @xmath17 .",
    "we hence shall assume the large energy band - gaps to be manifestations of structural and morphological trends of sns . before commenting on this however , notice the nature of band - gap variation with grain size .",
    "experimental data fits to @xmath42 where ` r ' is the radius of the nanoparticle and ` m ' the effective mass of the system . in other words , the band - gap is inversely proportional to the grain size .",
    "this fit suggests quantum confinement of the electrons @xcite .",
    "note that the data points represented by unshaded circles in fig  ( 9 ) have different ` a ' lattice parameter .",
    "fig  ( 10 ) uses the same data points of fig  ( 9 ) , abid in three dimension .",
    "we can now see the band - gap dependence on both grain size and lattice parameter .",
    "mathematically , the band - gap of sns nano - crystalline thin films is a two variable function of grain size and lattice parameter , @xmath43 .",
    "while the relation between the band - gap and grain size is a well known ( eqn  [ eeg ] ) , there is no known relation between the band - gap and lattice parameter ( ` a ' ) .",
    "hence , more studies would be required to establish the observed two variable dependency .",
    "tin sulphide films grown on glass substrates at room temperature by thermal evaporation were found to be nano - crystalline in nature for thicknesses more than 270  nm .",
    "x - ray diffraction shows that the grain size increased linearly with film thickness .",
    "diffraction studies and electron microscope images show that the atoms of sns are arranged in an layered and oriented manner with ortho - rhombic structure and residual tensile stress acting along the ` a ' axis .",
    "the films had direct band - gaps ranging from 1.8 - 2.1  ev depending on the grain size and lattice parameter .",
    "thus , the study reveals that the band - gap of sns is a two variable function , which can be tailored as per requirement by controlling the grain size and lattice parameter .",
