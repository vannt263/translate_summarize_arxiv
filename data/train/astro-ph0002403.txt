    "the first paper in this series ( hansen et al .",
    "@xcite , paperi ) presented infrared data for the abell2670 cluster .",
    "we identified 3 far - infrared sources apparently related to star forming galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the present paper concerns the rich cluster srsic159 - 03 . the central part of the srsic159 - 03 cluster was mapped by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) satellite , using the pht - c camera ( lemke et al .",
    "@xcite ) at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . the observations were performed twice with slightly different position angles which gives an opportunity to do independent detections and to study possible instrumental effects .    the srsic159 - 03 cluster ( abell s1101 , z=0.0564 ) is of richness class 0 , bautz - morgan typeiii with a central dominant cd galaxy ( abell et al .",
    "a cooling flow is present , and allen and fabian ( @xcite ) found a mass deposition rate of @xmath4 from rosat pspc data .",
    "the cooling flow is centered on the cd  galaxy which exhibits nebular line emission .",
    "crawford and fabian ( @xcite ) obtained optical spectra and found from line - ratio diagrams that the ratios obtained along the slit bridged the gap between classi and classii in the scheme of heckman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "their spectra had position angle @xmath5 . west of the center they discovered a detached filament of emission having extreme classii characteristics .",
    "they argued that the different line ratios are due to changes in ionization properties .",
    "below in fig .",
    "[ emission ] we show the extent of the nebular emission . in a subsequent paper crawford and fabian ( @xcite ) included iue data to obtain the optical - ultraviolet continuum .",
    "they announced that a strong ly@xmath6 line is present in the iue spectrum .",
    "a rectangular area centered on the cd galaxy of srsic159 - 03 was mapped by iso may 7 , 1996 on revolution 173 .",
    "the projected z - axis of the spacecraft had a position angle of @xmath7 on the sky ( measured from north through east ) .",
    "the observation was repeated june 4 , 1996 , during revolution 200 , but this time with position angle @xmath8 .",
    "the observing mode was pht32 as for abell2670 ( paperi ) .",
    "the 9 pixel c100 detector was used for @xmath9 and @xmath10 to map an area of @xmath11 . for @xmath12 and @xmath3 the 4 pixel c200 detector was applied to cover a mapped area of @xmath13 .",
    "the target dedicated times were 1467 seconds for c100 and 1852 seconds for c200 .",
    "= 8.7 cm    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ velo ]    donahue and voit ( @xcite ) obtained spectra of the nuclear emission from the srsic159 - 03 cd galaxy .",
    "they argued that the lack of [ caii ] @xmath14 emission indicates that ca is depleted onto dust grains .",
    "we have added all our spectra of the center together and all of the filaments .",
    "no [ caii ] emission was visible in any of the two resulting spectra .",
    "we then shifted the [ nii]@xmath15 to the expected position of [ caii ] and added the shifted line after scaling with various constants . in this way we find that no [ caii ] emission stronger than 0.20 times",
    "[ nii]@xmath15 is present .",
    "figure  1 of donahue and voit ( @xcite ) predicts ( from ionization calculations ) that this ratio should never be smaller than 0.24 .",
    "although marginal compared to the case of hydra  a the discrepancy can be explained by the condensation of ca onto grains in accord with donahue and voit s result .",
    "the presence of dust in the nebular gas does not necessarily exclude that it originates from the cooling cluster gas .",
    "dust may grow in dense , cool clouds in connection with star formation .",
    "for the nebular gas in hydra  a donahue and voit ( @xcite ) found a much tighter limit on the [ caii ] line strongly suggesting the presence of dust . in hydra  a the nebular gas is concentrated to a central disk - like structure of several kpc where vigorous star formation has taken place , and hansen  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) argue that it is a result of the cooling flow ( see also mcnamara , @xcite ) . in srsic159 - 03",
    "the extended nature of the filaments and the presence of the blue , star forming object is more in favour of a merger scenario , however .",
    "there are no striking optical identifications to the off - center sources .",
    "the position of c100 - 2 is relatively well determined by the overlap of the two observations . the nearest object visible in fig .",
    "[ field ] is @xmath16 to the south - west , is unresolved and of blue colour .",
    "it is not a known qso ( no qso is closer than @xmath17 in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) , and it is just outside the overlap of the two observations .",
    "there are several faint optical objects in the area of c100 - 3 , but no show up in our data with characteristics favouring a candidateship .",
    "the difficulties in pointing out candidates are even more pronounced for c100 - 4 which agrees poorly with the nearest faint objects in fig .",
    "[ field ] . however , c100 - 4 is also the most uncertain of the sources as it is only visible at @xmath9 .",
    "the availability of two observations covering essentially the same field at several wavelengths allows us to identify 4 faint ( @xmath18  jy ) far - infrared sources with some confidence . a central source , c100 - 1 ,",
    "is attributed to the cd galaxy which contains optical filaments , but our optical images do not reveal significant evidence of dust lanes .",
    "the fluxes measured for c100 - 1 are of the same order of magnitude as expected from dust related to star formation in the cooling flow . for the non - central sources we can not point out any particular optical candidates in contrast to the results from the abell2670 field ( paperi ) where galaxies with enhanced star formation were found coincident with the infrared sources .",
