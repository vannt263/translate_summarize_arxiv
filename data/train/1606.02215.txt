    "consider two distant observers , say alice and bob , sharing an entangled quantum state @xmath0 .",
    "alice performs one measurement chosen in a set @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , and bob performs a measurement chosen in a set @xmath4 ( with similar conditions ) .",
    "given that they choose the measurements labelled by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , the resulting statistics are given by @xmath7 the state @xmath0 is said to be local for measurements @xmath1 , @xmath4 if the distribution admits a bell - local decomposition @xmath8 that is , the quantum statistics can be reproduced using a lhv model consisting of a shared local variable @xmath9 , distributed with density @xmath10 , and local response functions given by distributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "if for some sets of measurements @xmath1 and @xmath4 a decomposition of the form can not be found , the distribution @xmath13 violates ( at least ) one bell inequality @xcite . in this case , we conclude that @xmath0 is nonlocal for the measurements @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "another concept that will be useful here is that of epr - steering @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "it is a weaker form of nonlocality which captures the fact that if alice makes a measurement on her half of the state @xmath0 she remotely steers bob s state .",
    "this nonlocal effect can be detected in the statistics of the experiment if bob measures his part of the state as well .",
    "specifically , if alice and bob perform measurements @xmath1 and @xmath4 , respectively , we say that @xmath0 is ` unsteerable ' ( from alice to bob ) if @xmath14 that is , the quantum statistics can be reproduced by a so - called local hidden state model ( lhs ) , where @xmath15 denotes the local quantum state and @xmath11 is alice s response function .",
    "if such a decomposition can not be found , @xmath0 is said to be ` steerable ' for the set @xmath16 ; note that one would usually consider here a set of measurements @xmath17 that is tomographically complete , and thus focus the analysis on the set of conditional states of bob s system @xmath18 referred to as an assemblage .",
    "note that any lhs model is also a lhv model , although the converse does not hold .",
    "if a state @xmath0 admits a decomposition for all measurements @xmath1 and @xmath4 we say that @xmath0 is local , i.e. @xmath0 admits a lhv model .",
    "similarly if @xmath0 admits a decomposition for all measurements @xmath1 we say that @xmath0 is unsteerable . with these definitions we have that entanglement , steering and nonlocality",
    "are strictly different concepts , even taking all possible povms into account .",
    "more precisely , one can show that there exist entangled states which are unsteerable ( hence local ) states , as well as entangled local states which are steerable .",
    "indeed , werner showed that some entangled quantum states admit a lhs model for _ all _ projective measurements @xcite .",
    "this result was later extended to general povms @xcite .",
    "similarly , certain steerable states were shown to admit a lhv model for projective measurements @xcite , and the same hold considering general povms @xcite .",
    "lhv and lhs models for different classes of entangled states were also constructed , see e.g. @xcite .     and perform local filters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . when the filtering is successful",
    ", they perform a standard bell test . if the resulting statistics @xmath13 violate a bell inequality , the state @xmath0 displays hidden nonlocality . here",
    "we ask if this effect is possible for all entangled states , and show that this is not the case . ]",
    "one could conclude from the above that local entangled states are somehow classical , as they can always be replaced by classical variables @xmath9 ( with no noticeable difference in any bell experiment ) .",
    "nevertheless the nonlocality of some local entangled quantum states can in fact be revealed in more complex ways than the traditional bell scenario . as first imagined by popescu @xcite",
    ", one could submit a quantum state to a _ sequence _ of measurements . indeed in quantum mechanics a measurement generally changes the state , leading to different statistics when a second round of measurements is applied .",
    "note that a measurement does not necessarily break the entanglement of the quantum state . on the contrary , for a given measurement outcome , entanglement can be increased .",
    "the simplest way to implement this idea is that of local filtering : alice and bob first perform local filters on their shared state @xmath0 , given by a set of kraus operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and similarly for bob .",
    "alice and bob keep the post - filter state only when @xmath0 ` passes ' the filter , meaning alice obtained the outcome corresponding to @xmath19 and bob the outcome corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "the state they hold in that case is given by @xmath24 in terms of state transformation the operation which transforms @xmath0 into @xmath25 can be seen as a stochastic local operation ( slo ) .",
    "note that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are any linear operators acting on @xmath26 ( respectively @xmath27 ) and can in particular increase or decrease the dimension of the hilbert space of the quantum state .",
    "next alice and bob can perform a standard bell test on @xmath25 , that is they perform a second round of local measurements @xmath28 and @xmath29 . repeating the process many times one can access the statistics @xmath30 , and check whether it admits a bell - local decomposition .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in figure 1 .    can @xmath25 be nonlocal although @xmath0 admits a lhv model ( in the standard bell scenario ) ?",
    "ref @xcite showed that indeed this can be the case for certain werner states admitting lhv models for projective measurements , while ref .",
    "@xcite extended this result by considering a state @xmath0 admitting a lhv model for general povms .",
    "hence there are entangled states that can not lead to nonlocality in the standard bell - scenario ( even taking general povms into account ) , but nevertheless violate a bell inequality after local filtering .",
    "these examples open the question of whether all entangled states can lead to hidden nonlocality .",
    "that is , for any entangled state @xmath0 , can we find local filters @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that the resulting state @xmath25 is nonlocal ?",
    "we answer this question in the negative by constructing an explicit counter - example .",
    "consider the two - qubit werner state : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the maximally entangled two - qubit state and @xmath35 is the maximally mixed state .",
    "the state @xmath36 is entangled if and only if @xmath37 . while werner originally constructed a lhs model for @xmath38 and projective measurements , this was later extended .",
    "indeed , local models were presented , for all projective measurements and @xmath39 @xcite , and for povms for @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the state is steerable for @xmath41 @xcite , and nonlocal for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "our main result is that @xmath36 remains local , considering arbitrary povms , after _ any _ local filtering for @xmath43 .",
    "hence the entangled state @xmath44 displays no hidden nonlocality .",
    "this can be formalized with the following theorem :    * theorem 1 . * for @xmath45 the state @xmath46 is local for all povms . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 represent any possible local filters ; @xmath47 .    _ proof .",
    "_ we will proceed in two steps .",
    "first we characterize the filtered state when only alice applies a local filter .",
    "then we show that this state remains local over all operations applied locally by bob .",
    "consider again the werner state @xmath36 defined in .",
    "alice applies a local filtering @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath36 passes the filter , alice and bob hold the state @xmath48 given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the identity operator in bob s hilbert space .",
    "one can show that this state is unsteerable from alice to bob ( for all povms ) if and only if the state @xmath51 is unsteerable from alice to bob ( povms ) , for all @xmath52 $ ] . here",
    ", @xmath53 is the partially entangled state and @xmath54 its partial trace .    to prove this claim consider first the unnormalized filtered state @xmath55 using the singular value decomposition one can write @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are unitary matrices and @xmath58 is diagonal and positive . note that since @xmath19 is a @xmath59 matrix , @xmath60 is @xmath61 , @xmath58 is @xmath59 and @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "we thus have @xmath64 we can then use the fact that if the state @xmath0 is unsteerable so is @xmath65 ( for an arbitrary unitary @xmath66 acting on alice s subspace ) as the statistics coming from a measurement @xmath67 is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is another ( valid ) measurement .",
    "we can therefore focus on the unormalized state @xmath70 by the same observation as above we can apply any unitary @xmath71 on bob s side . choosing @xmath72 we get @xmath73 using the @xmath74 symmetry of @xmath36 .",
    "finally , note that the normalization @xmath75 is independent of @xmath76 .",
    "the one - side filtered werner state @xmath77 is thus equivalent ( up to local unitaries ) to @xmath78 , as stated above .",
    "note also that for @xmath79 @xmath80 is equivalent to @xmath78 , up to local unitaries .",
    "therefore , we can focus only on the interval @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "after alice has applied her filter , we are left with the state , on which bob will now apply his filter @xmath20 .",
    "a possible approach to deal with bob s filter is to use the concept of steering , introduced above . indeed",
    "if a state @xmath0 is unsteerable from alice to bob , then the state remains unsteerable ( hence local ) after any local operation on bob s side . for a proof see @xcite , lemma 2 . in our case , this implies that if @xmath78 is unsteerable ( from alice to bob ) , then the state @xmath81 is unsteerable , hence local .",
    "thus we can prove the theorem by showing that the state @xmath82 is unsteerable ( from alice to bob ) for all @xmath52 $ ] and for all povms . note that if we restricted ourselves to projective measurements on alice s side we could use the family of lhs models presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the requirement of general povms forces us to find another approach .",
    "in particular the restriction of projective measurements would prevent alice s filter from increasing the dimension of the hilbert space , and is thus not general enough .    in order to construct a lhs model for states of the form",
    "@xmath78 we use several methods , in particular the algorithmic method presented in @xcite . in principle",
    "this method allows us to find a lhs model for any given unsteerable state .",
    "however , here we need to prove that the entire class of states @xmath82 admits a lhs model , for a fixed value @xmath83 and the whole interval @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "to do so we first choose finitely many angles @xmath84 $ ] in order to get pairs @xmath85 such that @xmath86 admits a lhs model .",
    "then we consider convex combinations of these states with separable states in order to extend the model to the whole interval .",
    "to finish the proof , we must treat the interval boundaries , i.e. the two limits @xmath87 and @xmath88 , for which we use different techniques .     of eq .",
    "admit a lhs model for all povms . as explained in the main text , we separate the interval @xmath52 $ ] in three regions",
    ". in interval @xmath89 $ ] , the existence of a lhs model is guaranteed below the black dashed horizontal line . in interval",
    "@xmath90 $ ] , a lhs model is demonstrated for all points below the blue dashed curve . in interval",
    "@xmath91 $ ] , a lhs model exists below the green dash - dotted curve .",
    "overall , this guarantees that the state @xmath78 admits a lhs model for @xmath92 and for all values of @xmath52 $ ] , i.e. all points below the red solid horizontal line . ]",
    "we consequently break the interval @xmath93 $ ] in three sub - intervals : @xmath94 $ ] , @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "let us start with @xmath99 . here",
    "@xmath100 is in the neighbourhood of @xmath101 .",
    "we decompose the target state @xmath78 as a mixture of states admitting a lhs model for povms . specifically , we search for which values of @xmath100 and @xmath76 , we can find a convex combination of the form : @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "recall that the werner state @xmath104 admits a lhs model for povms @xcite . here",
    "@xmath105 is an unspecified two - qubit state , and as long as @xmath105 admits a lhs model , this implies that @xmath78 is unsteerable , as one can write it as a probabilistic mixture of two unsteerable states .",
    "a simple solution is to demand that @xmath106 be separable . by setting @xmath107",
    ", we obtain a diagonal matrix @xmath105 ( for all @xmath76 and @xmath100 ) . to verify that @xmath105 represents a valid state",
    ", we only need to ensure that its eigenvalues are positive .",
    "one can check that this is the case when @xmath108    now we focus on the interval @xmath109 . in this regime",
    "we essentially use the technique presented in @xcite .",
    "more precisely we choose finitely many values @xmath110",
    "( @xmath111 ) . for each of them , a slightly improved version of protocol 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to find a value @xmath112 such that @xmath86 admits a lhs model for povms ( more details in appendix a ) .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are shown on the blue dashed curve of fig .",
    "2 . in order to extend the result to the continuous interval @xmath109 , we use the following lemma , which is proven in appendix b :    * lemma 1 . *",
    "if the state @xmath78 is unsteerable from alice to bob ( for povms ) then the state @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , is also unsteerable from alice to bob ( for povms ) as long as @xmath116    therefore , given a point @xmath117 for which the state admits a lhs model , we can ensure that @xmath78 admits a lhs model as long as @xmath118 and @xmath119 . as expected",
    "this is a decreasing function of @xmath100 , but we only need to cover the interval @xmath120 $ ] , implying that the minimal value of @xmath76 in this interval is @xmath121 , which is close to @xmath112 if @xmath113 and @xmath122 are close . therefore , we have to choose @xmath122 sufficiently close to @xmath113 , such that the value of @xmath76 does not drop below @xmath83 .",
    "we are thus left with the interval @xmath123 , where @xmath100 is in the neighbourhood of @xmath124 .",
    "we can not use the same method as in @xmath109 as whatever smallest @xmath125 we choose , lemma 1 only allows us to say something about some @xmath126 , leaving the interval @xmath127 $ ] unsolved .",
    "note also that by setting @xmath128 we get a separable state and consequently mixing it with another separable state can not give rise to an entangled one ( note that setting @xmath129 in lemma 1 , one obtains @xmath130 ) .",
    "however , in this region , an explicit lhs model for projective measurements is known @xcite .",
    "the model holds for @xmath78 as long as @xmath131 to take povms into account we use a method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , protocol 2 .",
    "starting from an entangled state @xmath0 admitting a local model for projective measurements , we can construct another entangled state @xmath25 admitting a local model for povms . note that while the method was originally developed for lhv , we use it here for lhs models ( i.e. only on alice s side ) .",
    "specifically , we now apply this method to the state @xmath78 where condition is fulfilled , thus ensuring that the state admits a lhs model for projective measurements .",
    "we obtain the class of states @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "this state is therefore unsteerable from alice to bob , for all povms .",
    "the last step consists in showing that @xmath78 , where @xmath134 can be written as a convex combination of @xmath135 and a separable state , for all @xmath136 .",
    "this proof is given in appendix c for @xmath137 .    finally , we summarize these results in fig .",
    "this implies that the state @xmath78 is unsteerable for @xmath138 , and for all @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "therefore the werner state @xmath139 displays no hidden nonlocality .",
    "we proved that there exist entangled quantum states which do not display hidden nonlocality , i.e. which remain local after any local filtering on a single copy of the state .",
    "specifically we showed this to be the case for some two - qubit werner states .",
    "this consequently proves that local filters ( or equivalently slocc procedures before the bell test ) are not a universal way to reveal nonlocality from entanglement .    the natural question now is wether the use of even more general measurement strategies could help to reveal the nonlocality of the states we consider .",
    "in particular , one could look at sequential measurements @xcite , beyond local filters , and consider the entire statistics of the measurements . here , one chooses between several possible measurements ( or filters ) at each round . in order to show that a quantum state is local",
    ", one should now construct a lhv model that is genuinely sequential .",
    "that is , the distribution of the local variable should be fully independent of the choice of the sequence of measurements .",
    "indeed , this is not the case in our model , as the distribution of the local variable depends on alice s filter .",
    "nevertheless , as our model is of the lhs form , the distribution of local states does not depend on the choice of local filter for bob , and more generally covers any possible sequence of measurements on bob s side .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to see if one can find a model that holds for arbitrary sequences of measurements on alice s side as well .",
    "if this is not the case , then a sequence of measurements should be considered strictly more powerful than local filtering in bell tests .",
    "there exists however another possible extension of the bell scenario , where alice and bob share many copies of the state . here",
    ", in each run of the experiment , the two observers can now perform joint measurements on the many copies they hold .",
    "it has been shown that some local entangled states ( in the standard bell scenario ) produce nonlocal statistics in this setup @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is known as ` super - activation ' of quantum nonlocality .",
    "while it is not known whether super activation is possible for all entangled states , it was nevertheless shown that any entangled state useful for teleportation ( or equivalently , with entanglement fraction greater than @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the local hilbert space dimension ) can be super activated @xcite .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the class of states we considered , i.e. two - qubit werner states , are always useful for teleportation @xcite and can thus be super activated .",
    "our result thus demonstrates that quantum nonlocality via local filtering or many - copy bell tests are inequivalent .",
    "finally , the main open question is still whether there exists an entangled state that would display no form of nonlocality , considering arbitrary sequential measurements on many copies , or in quantum networks @xcite where stronger notions of nonlocality could be considered @xcite .",
