    "collisions of electrons or positrons with protons ( @xmath1 ) are among the particle reactions which have been intensively used to study different mechanisms for heavy quarkonium production . in this report",
    "we limit ourselves to the production of @xmath0 mesons , which have an experimentally very clean signature due to the large branching ratios of their leptonic decay modes .",
    "let us start with some definitions . in @xmath1 collisions the electron interacts with the proton almost entirely via a bremsstrahlung photon @xmath2 . in most reactions",
    ", this photon is quasi - real , its squared momentum @xmath3 being very small .",
    "this kinematic region is called _ photoproduction _ , while the region in which the photon retains a high virtuality @xmath4 is called _",
    "leptoproduction_. a second way to classify the reactions is to look at the inelasticity variable @xmath5 . in the proton rest frame",
    ", @xmath6 is the ratio of the photon momentum taken over by the @xmath0 meson . at values @xmath7 ,",
    "the @xmath0 absorbs nearly all of the photon momentum , and a rapidity gap can be observed .",
    "this kinematic range is called _ elastic _ or _ diffractive _ production .",
    "we call it _ elastic _ in case of a really exclusive @xmath8 process , and _ diffractive _ , if during the reaction the initial proton evolves into a low lying nucleon resonance . the kinematic region with @xmath9",
    "is called _ inelastic _ production , and inelastic leptoproduction is called _ deep inelastic scattering _ ( dis ) .",
    "there are different models on the market which aim to describe the inelastic production of heavy quarkonia . in all these models ,",
    "the photon interacts with only one parton inside the proton . in the usual",
    "_ collinear _ factorization , the initial parton is assumed to be on shell and collinear to the proton .",
    "we obtain the hadronic cross section by folding the partonic ones with parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton @xmath12 , which can be a gluon or ( anti-)quark . within the framework of _",
    "nonrelativistic qcd _",
    "( nrqcd ) @xcite , the partonic @xmath0 production cross section factorizes further according to @xmath13+x ) \\ ; \\langle{\\cal o}^{j/\\psi}[n ] \\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] into perturbative short distance cross sections @xmath14+x)$ ] and long distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) @xmath15\\rangle$ ] , usually fitted to experimental data .",
    "@xmath16 can be any intermediate fock state , including color octet ( co ) states .",
    "according to nrqcd , each @xmath15\\rangle$ ] scales with a definite power of the relative quark velocity @xmath17 , which then serves as an additional expansion parameter besides @xmath18 .",
    "the main contribution stems from the @xmath19}$ ] term , which equals the _ color singlet model _ ( csm ) prediction and the next - to - leading contributions stem from intermediate @xmath20}$ ] , @xmath21}$ ] , and @xmath22}$ ] co states .    the idea behind using the _ @xmath23 factorization _",
    "@xcite method is that in quarkonium production processes with typical hard scattering scales much lower than the collision energies , the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 is so small that the parton s transverse momentum @xmath23 should not be neglected .",
    "therefore the initial parton is off shell .",
    "the partonic cross section , which is so far only evaluated at leading order in @xmath18 , is then convoluted with _ unintegrated _ , @xmath23 dependent pdfs , which are derived from the usual gluon pdfs either in a bfkl @xcite or dglap @xcite approach . usually , only color singlet ( cs ) contributions are considered for @xmath0 production calculations in this formalism . the monte carlo program cascade @xcite simulates initial gluon radiation in such an approach .",
    "born level calculations for the @xmath0 photoproduction yield have been performed in the color singlet model @xcite already in 1980 , and the calculation including the color octet states @xcite has been performed soon after the invention of nrqcd . while these leading order predictions do include _ resolved _ contributions , in which the photon interacts via its hadronic content , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions are so far only known for the _ direct _ processes .",
    "figure  [ figa ] shows the result of our recent nlo nrqcd analysis @xcite of the inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction cross section using values for the co ldmes obtained from a combined nlo fit to the @xmath24 distributions of cdf tevatron @xcite and h1 hera @xcite @xmath0 production data .",
    "the cs contributions alone undershoot the h1 data @xcite typically by a factor of three , which is however a much lesser deviation than in the hadroproduction case .",
    "our cs results are in agreement with previous nlo csm calculations @xcite .",
    "apparent differences to the early work of @xcite are only due to different parameter choices .",
    "the sum of the cs and co contributions on the other hand describes the data sufficiently well .",
    "as for the @xmath6 distribution , the cross section at low @xmath6 is expected to rise once we include the resolved photon contribution . near the high @xmath6 endpoint region ,",
    "the nrqcd expansion is understood to break down , and the nrqcd series could be resummed via the introduction of universal _ shape functions _",
    "@xcite , possibly in the context of soft collinear effective theory @xcite",
    ". the main achievement of our recent work @xcite , which is a continuation of @xcite , is to show that @xmath0 photoproduction at h1 hera and hadroproduction at cdf tevatron , phenix rhic and cms lhc can consistently be described by a unique set of co ldmes .",
    "figure  [ figb ] shows the monte carlo results of cascade compared to the same h1 hera2 data @xcite .",
    "it gives very good results , even though , according to the author , there is no kind of tuning of cascade parameters to the data involved .",
    "the @xmath23 factorization calculation @xcite also shows good agreement with h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite hera1 data .     the h1 hera2 data @xcite compared to cascade @xcite predictions .",
    "relative to figure [ figa]a , the cross section is divided by an averaged photon flux factor 0.102 .",
    "this plot is taken from @xcite.,width=188 ]                      as for polarization observables , theoretical predictions have been made for the color singlet contributions at nlo @xcite .",
    "the color octet contributions , however , are so far only known at leading order @xcite . in figure",
    "[ figc ] , these are compared to recent zeus data @xcite together with the @xmath23 factorization prediction @xcite . here , the polarization parameter @xmath25 is defined according to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the polar angle of the decay - muons in the target reference frame",
    ". values @xmath28 ( -1 ) correspond to fully transversely ( longitudinally ) polarized @xmath0 mesons . like in the h1 polarization analysis in @xcite , which is done in the helicity and collins - soper frame ,",
    "both theoretical and experimental errors are still too large to draw definite conclusions about the agreement for the different production mechanisms .",
    "specifically , no nlo calculation including co contributions has been performed yet .      in contrast to inelastic photoproduction , dis squared matrix elements contain a further scale @xmath4 , which may be one reason , why until now only leading order calculations have been performed for @xmath0 production in dis . in figure  [ figd ] ,",
    "the results of the nrqcd calculation @xcite , the @xmath23 factorization calculation @xcite and cascade @xcite predictions are compared to zeus @xcite and h1 data @xcite . due to the large theoretical uncertainties , conclusions are difficult to be drawn , but the cs prediction in collinear factorizations again seems to lie rather below the data , while we again see an overshoot of the co contributions at high @xmath6 .    as for @xmath0 polarization in dis",
    ", no measurement and only the csm calculation @xcite have been done so far .",
    "in elastic or diffractive @xmath0 production , the photon couples to the @xmath29 pair , which then in turn interacts with the proton through the exchange of an object with vacuum quantum numbers , for example two or more gluons . within the two - gluon - ladder model",
    ", the leading logarithms of this ladder can be resummed using bfkl @xcite evolution .    in figure  [ fige ] , diffractive @xmath0 photoproduction cross sections measured at zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite",
    "are compared to theoretical predictions using a dglap @xcite or bfkl @xcite approach .",
    "measurements for elastic @xmath0 production have been performed by the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite collaborations for both photoproduction @xcite and leptoproduction @xcite .",
    "collisions of electrons or positrons and protons at hera have been a very important testing field for different models for the production of heavy quarkonia , of @xmath0 in particular .",
    "the results must , of course , be seen in combination with quarkonium production in other particle reactions , for example in hadron collisions .",
    "the simple collinear factorization color singlet model seems to be disfavored by inelastic @xmath0 production data .",
    "therefore , promising attempts have been made to explain the data either within nrqcd via the introduction of intermediate color octet states or within the @xmath23 factorization approach . however",
    ", none of the models is ruled out yet .",
