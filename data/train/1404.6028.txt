    ", at @xmath6 , the atomic wave functions are diffracted into three branches ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) by a short standing - wave pulse of light , the `` splitting pulse . ''",

    "the contrast of the density grating , and thus the reflected light signal intensity , oscillates as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an amplitude envelope caused by the finite spatial extent of the initial condensate , as opposed to the infinite plane waves of the simple model , and @xmath15 is the time - dependent phase of the @xmath16 branch .",
    "this signal oscillates due to the kinetic energy of the @xmath17 branches .",

    "this may then be combined with other fundamental constants to arrive at the fine structure constant@xcite .",
    "the experiments reported in this paper were performed in the apparatus described in @xcite .",
    "all experiments used the isotope @xmath26 , which has a recoil frequency @xmath27 . for this work",

    "we also verified that a ci signal could be obtained with a non - degenerate ( i.e. , above the condensation temperature ) source .",
    "however , the signal quality was substantially inferior to that obtained from a bec source .",
    "we used a single , retro - reflected laser beam to create the standing - wave gratings .",

    "some data sets were taken with blue detuning and others with red detuning .",
    "no substantial differences were found between the two as , even at our peak @xmath6 densities of @xmath35 , index of refraction effects fall below our level of sensitivity . for the readout light ,",
    "the detuning was reduced to @xmath36 .",
    "a substantial technical advantage of using such a narrow transition is that all of these frequencies can be accessed with a single @xmath37 acousto - optic modulator .    for the splitting pulse we used a square pulse of length @xmath38 .",
    "the mirror pulse was a gaussian with intensity @xmath39 half - width @xmath40 .",
    "this pulse achieved a second - order diffraction efficiency of @xmath41 .",
    "the readout pulse was typically a @xmath42 square pulse .",
    "most interferometer geometries use an externally applied diffraction grating  either material gratings or standing waves of light  as a ruler to read out the final phase . in a ci , two matter - wave gratings are produced which serve as phase rulers for one another .",
    "this eliminates the requirements for complex control of the external grating . for a light - pulse interferometer",

    "to compare the ci to a more traditional atom interferometer , we created an identical , three - branch interferometer , but with an external diffraction grating readout .",
    "the weak traveling - wave pulse at the end of the ci was replaced by a short standing - wave pulse identical to the splitting pulse .",
    "the populations in the @xmath47 states oscillate at @xmath48 as the time of the final pulse is scanned .",
    "we observe this oscillation in time - of - flight absorption images . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b , the visibility of this signal begins to decline sharply around @xmath45 , while the ci signal continues essentially unchanged to @xmath49 .",
    "the current state of the art for recoil measurements is part per billion ( ppb ) accuracy@xcite .",
    "controlling unwanted interactions is key to this level of accuracy .",
    "the symmetry of the ci geometry controls several external perturbations .",
    "the phase measured in a ci , eq ( [ ciphasecombo ] ) , is insensitive to any external field that causes a constant shift of energy or an energy gradient across the interferometer .",
    "given the small volume sampled by the ci , and yb s lack of magnetic moment , the effects of external fields can be reduced or measured and subtracted to below the ppb level , as will be described in section [ sec : future ] .",
    "we now turn , instead , to the two largest systematic shifts for a fine structure constant measurement with a yb ci : diffraction phases and atomic interactions .",
    "the immunity of a ci to outside influence allows us to cleanly probe and control these effects .",
    "diffraction phases were first suggested as an important systematic effect in a ci by buchner et al .",
    "they have been studied previously with diffraction from material gratings@xcite and from light - pulse gratings near the raman - nath regime ( @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the length of the pulse and @xmath52 is the rabi frequency for one of the diffraction beams ) @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the diffraction phases are essentially unaffected by small fluctuations in intensity or pulse duration between shots and so cancel in the final analysis .",
    "while our splitting pulse falls in the raman - nath regime , the mirror pulse falls between it and the easy to calculate bragg ( @xmath53 ) regime@xcite .",
    "pulses in this intermediate regime are critical elements to recoil measurements both as mirror pulses and for acceleration of moving interferometer branches . in this regime ,",
    "diffraction phases depend sensitively on small changes of intensity or pulse shape from shot to shot . to correct for these changes , we record the time - dependent intensity of each mirror pulse .",
    "we treat the laser pulses as single - atom effects , ignoring collective effects and energy shifts due to inter - atomic interactions . for our detunings and the reduced atomic density at the time of the mirror pulse , collective effects",
    "( e.g. , super - radiance@xcite ) are negligible .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the energy difference between ground ( @xmath56 ) and excited ( @xmath57 ) electronic states , @xmath58 is the angular frequency of the light , and @xmath59 is the rabi frequency of the @xmath60 diffraction beam .",
    "we calculate the effect of each pulse numerically , using the measured time dependence of the intensity . for simulation purposes ,",
    "the intensity at the position of the bec is needed , whereas only the total power in the diffraction beams can feasibly be recorded .",
    "calibration of local intensity for a given power is obtained by recording the effect of mirror pulses with varying powers .        after calculating the diffraction phase",
    "we subtract it from the phase of the contrast signal , @xmath24 .",
    "we extract @xmath24 by fitting a sine wave to the signal and finding its phase at time @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows data before and after this correction .",
    "in addition to a uniform noise width , we also see a marked drift in phase over time .",
    "this drift is eliminated in the corrected data , showing that it arose from drifts in laser intensity .",
    "we also note that the noise width is reduced by the correction .",
    "overall , the standard deviation of the data set drops from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "the ability to correct for phase shifts induced by both laser drift and random laser noise gives good confirmation of our model .",
    "all data discussed below have these corrections applied .",
    "experiments with different @xmath23 have the atoms in different parts of the diffraction beam when the mirror pulse occurs .",
    "thus , local intensity will differ across @xmath23 , even for pulses with identical power and temporal shape .",
    "substantial differences in diffraction phase between experiments at different @xmath23 can accrue from these local intensity differences .",
    "so , the diffraction phase is an important systematic effect even with perfect control of laser pulse powers .",
    "our simulations can correct for this shift to the @xmath63 per pulse level , limited by the accuracy of the power to local intensity calibration .",
    "finally , we consider atomic interactions .",
    "we use the mean - field approximation , wherein all atoms are assumed to have the same single - particle wave function .",
    "each atom feels an effective potential due to the other atoms in the bec .",
    "the potential can be parametrized purely by the @xmath64-wave scattering length @xmath65 .",
    "this approach leads to the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mean - field wave function . in this work ,",
    "our yb becs typically contain @xmath68 atoms .",
    "this large number coupled with the small scattering length of @xmath26 ( @xmath69 ) make the gpe accurate to better than 1% .    to simplify the gpe , and to clarify the physics ,",
    "we combine scaling solutions and the slowly - varying envelope approximation ( svea)@xcite .",
    "these techniques allow each of the branches populated by the splitting pulse to be treated independently .",
    "each momentum branch of the condensate then obeys a gpe with extra interaction terms to describe interactions between branches .",
    "the phase evolution depends on the ratio in which atomic density splits between the various branches .",
    "we introduce an asymmetry parameter , @xmath70 , such that the ratio of densities is @xmath71 for the @xmath72 and @xmath9 branches .",
    "the four interaction effects seen in the svea are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .    , density at time of splitting , @xmath73 , the difference between @xmath18 and the time of perfect overlap , @xmath74 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the branches are represented by red , black , and blue lumps .",
    "solid lines show density profiles , and dashed lines show phase profiles .",
    "the gray box in the phase curvature illustration highlights that the center of the black @xmath75 branch interferes with the wings of the @xmath47 branches .",
    "values given to illustrate the relative sizes are for an experiment with @xmath76 , 2 ms of expansion time , and @xmath77 . ]    first , there are intrabranch energy shifts .",
    "these shifts arise from the interaction energy of a single branch of an atom with the total atomic density in that branch of the interferometer . from equation [ ciphasecombo ] , the phase of the signal will be shifted by the difference between intrabranch energy for the moving versus non - moving branches .",
    "thus , the phase shift is proportional to @xmath78 , where @xmath73 is the atomic density just before the initial splitting .",
    "there are similar interbranch interactions . during the time",
    "the branches of the interferometer are overlapped in space the @xmath79 branch of an atom will interact with the total atomic density in the @xmath8 branch of the bec .",
    "this gives an energy shift analogous to that from intrabranch interactions .",
    "similar shifts arise for all other pairs of momentum states .",
    "importantly , interbranch interactions are twice as strong due to the distinguishability of the two branches .",
    "the moving branches have a shift proportional to @xmath80 ( the @xmath81 comes from the moving branches overlapping with one another half the time they overlap with the nonmoving branch ) while the shift on the non - moving branch is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the overall effect scales as @xmath83 .    additionally , as the branches separate they exert forces on each other that accelerate the moving branches .",
    "this increases the momentum from @xmath6 to @xmath1 by an amount @xmath84 .",
    "however , the mirror pulse is not exactly a mirror .",
    "rather , it changes the momentum by @xmath85 .",
    "the branch with momentum @xmath86 just before @xmath1 will have momentum @xmath87 just after @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the term @xmath88 will cancel out of the total phase accumulation .",
    "only the term quadratic in @xmath89 from the total kinetic energy survives .",
    "thus , the total phase shift from this effect is proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "a final , less obvious effect of interactions involves the phase curvature across the condensate . due to the acceleration effect ,",
    "the branches may not be perfectly overlapped at time @xmath18 .",
    "the actual time of perfect overlap is referred to as the closing time of the interferometer . in this case , the grating is formed by the interference between non - analogous parts of the different branches . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] the gray box highlights the fact that the center of the @xmath8 momentum branch interferes with the wings of the @xmath47 branches .",
    "the phase accumulated due to interactions in the bec before splitting is curved like the density profile that generates it , as first demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the phase is greatest in the center of a branch and decreases into the wings .",
    "this effect scales like @xmath91 , where @xmath74 is the difference in time between the proper closing time and the time when data is taken .",
    "this shift can be made negligibly small by taking data at @xmath92 rather than at @xmath18 .",
    "taking data at @xmath92 spoils the cancellation of the @xmath88 term in the acceleration shift .",
    "thus , a trade - off must be made in deciding between @xmath18 and the closing time . in this work",
    "all data was taken around @xmath18 .    to test the accuracy of these calculated corrections ,",
    "we apply them to two @xmath49 data sets differing only in their density splittings , one with @xmath93 and another with @xmath94 . in these experiments ,",
    "the bec is allowed to expand for only @xmath95 before the splitting pulse . for a high - precision data set",
    ", the expansion time may be @xmath96 , which reduces the density , and thus the interaction effects , by a factor of more than 10 .",
    "the artificially short expansion time , and resultant high density , used for these two data sets magnifies the interaction effects . before applying interaction shift corrections",
    ", their phase difference is @xmath97 . after applying the corrections , the difference is @xmath98 .",
    "the large error bar is due to uncertainty in trap geometry and turn - off . in a high - precision recoil experiment",
    ", trap parameters can be both better controlled and better measured , reducing the uncertainty . together with longer expansion times",
    ", these should enable correction of interaction effects at the @xmath99 level .",
    "we apply the diffraction phase and atomic interaction corrections described in sections iii and iv to all our data . on separate data runs ,",
    "we have achieved accuracies of 45 and 60 ppm in the yb recoil frequency ( which translates into 23 and 30 ppm in alpha , respectively ) .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainty in trap shape and turnoff limits our current accuracy .",
    "comparing larger data sets taken on different days allows us to achieve higher precision .",
    "however , these comparisons show greater inaccuracy indicating that there are experimental parameters that drift from day to day",
    ". better measurement and control of all experimental parameters such as trap shape will be key to future work , but should not constitute a substantial impediment .    to assess the scalability of our interferometer , we have made two separate measurements of the yb recoil frequency with 7 ppm precision , one with @xmath100 ( uncertainty in @xmath24 , @xmath101 in 500 runs ) and a second with @xmath102 ( @xmath103 in 150 runs ) by combining data sets from different days .",
    "we use these precision benchmarks to discuss scaling to higher precision through acceleration of the moving branches .",
    "competitive recoil measurements will require acceleration of the moving branches of the ci to momenta @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is an integer .",
    "as the phase evolution in the ci scales with @xmath106@xcite , achieving @xmath107 would allow a precision of 0.7 ppb simply by scaling current results . at this level ,",
    "improved tests of qed could be made@xcite .",
    "achieving @xmath107 requires reasonable extension of previously demonstrated techniques for large coherent accelerations , using either bloch oscillations@xcite or a sequence of bragg pulses@xcite . the diffraction phase systematic scales like @xmath108 .",
    "the interaction systematic does not scale with @xmath105 at all .",
    "therefore , our demonstrated control of these effects is encouraging for the prospect of achieving sub - ppb accuracy in an @xmath107 experiment .",
    "systematic effects can be organized into three groups : interactions of atoms with external fields , the diffraction laser beams , and each other .",
    "having addressed atom - atom interactions in section [ sec : atomint ] , we consider the sizes of external field interactions and laser beam interactions other than the diffraction phase , which was dealt with in section [ sec : diffphase ] .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : systematicshifts ] .",
    "the phase of the signal depends on the combination of phases seen in .",

    "however , the linearly polarized light used for the diffraction pulses can be decomposed into equal magnitudes of right and left circularly polarized light .",
    "this shows that an applied magnetic field which splits the excited @xmath113 state will , to leading order , have no net effect , as one of @xmath114 will shift away from resonance while the other shifts toward . to reduce the residual shift of the diffraction phase ( largest laser beam interaction shift ) to the @xmath111 level",

    "<S> using a three - path contrast interferometer ( ci ) geometry and laser - pulse diffraction gratings , we create the first matter - wave interferometer with ytterbium ( yb ) atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we present advances in contrast interferometry relevant to high - precision measurements . by comparing to a traditional atom interferometer </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the immunity of the ci to vibrations for long interaction times ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize and demonstrate control over the two largest systematic effects for a high - precision measurement of the fine structure constant via photon recoil with our interferometer : diffraction phases and atomic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> diffraction phases are an important systematic for most interferometers using large - momentum transfer beam splitters ; atomic interactions are a key concern for any bec interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the prospects for a future sub - part per billion photon recoil measurement using a yb ci . </S>"
