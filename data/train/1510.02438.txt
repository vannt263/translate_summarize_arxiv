    "@xcite . in their full generality ( that is , without the restriction that the hypergraph is uniform )",
    ", the concept of threshold hypergraphs is equivalent to that of threshold monotone boolean functions , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a polynomial time recognition algorithm for threshold monotone boolean functions represented by their complete dnf was given by peled and simeone  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on linear programming and implies a polynomial time recognition algorithm for threshold hypergraphs .",

    "@xmath18 , defined by @xmath19 shows that the sets of hyperedges of threshold sperner hypergraphs are in a one - to - one correspondence with the sets of minimal feasible binary solutions to a linear inequality of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath13 .",
    "a set of vertices @xmath14 in a hypergraph is said to be _ independent _ if it does not contain any hyperedge , and _ dependent _ otherwise .",
    "thus , threshold hypergraphs are exactly the hypergraphs admitting a linear function on the vertices separating the characteristic vectors of the independent sets from the characteristic vectors of dependent sets .",
    "sperner hypergraphs can be equivalently defined as the hypergraphs such that every two distinct hyperedges @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy @xmath24 this point of view motivated chiarelli and milani to define in  @xcite a hypergraph @xmath1 to be _ dually sperner _ if every two distinct hyperedges @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy @xmath25 it was shown in  @xcite that dually sperner hypergraphs are threshold . in  @xcite , these hypergraphs were applied to characterize two classes of graphs defined by the following properties .",
    "every induced subgraph has a non - negative linear vertex weight function separating the characteristic vectors of all total dominating sets  @xcite ( resp . , connected dominating sets  @xcite ) from the characteristic vectors of all other sets .",
    "the non - negativity of the weight function @xmath26 in the definition of threshold hypergraphs implies that only minimal hyperedges matter for the thresholdness property of a given hypergraph . since dually sperner hypergraphs are threshold , we focus on the family of hypergraphs that are both sperner and dually sperner .",

    "@xmath0-sperner_. thus , a hypergraph @xmath1 is @xmath0-sperner if and only if for every pair @xmath2 of distinct hyperedges of @xmath1 both inequalities ,  hold .",
    "in other words , every two distinct hyperedges @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy @xmath27 note that by definition , all hypergraphs with at most one hyperedge ( possibly with no vertices ) are @xmath0-sperner .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we prove a decomposition theorem for @xmath0-sperner hypergraphs and examine several of its consequences , including the fact that the characteristic vectors of the hyperedges of a @xmath0-sperner hypergraph are linearly independent . from this",
    "we derive an upper bound on the size of a @xmath0-sperner hypergraph , as well as a lower bound on the size of a @xmath0-sperner hypergraph without universal , isolated , and twin vertices .",
    "second , we show that within the class of normal sperner hypergraphs ( that is , within the class of maximal clique hypergraphs of graphs ) , the classes of @xmath0-sperner hypergraphs , of threshold hypergraphs , and of @xmath4-asummable hypergraphs coincide .",
    "these classes provide three new characterizations of threshold graphs : a graph is threshold if and only if its clique hypergraph is @xmath0-sperner , or equivalently threshold , or equivalently @xmath4-assumable .",
    "every hypergraph @xmath28 with a fixed pair of orderings of its vertices and edges , say @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , can be represented with its _ incidence matrix _",
    "@xmath31 having rows and columns indexed by edges and vertices of @xmath1 , respectively , and being defined as @xmath32 note the slight abuse of notation above : the incidence matrix does not depend only on the hypergraph but also on the pair of orderings of its vertices and edges",
    ". we will be able to neglect this technical issue often in the paper , but not always .",
    "we will therefore say that two matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the same dimensions are _ permutation equivalent _ , and denote this fact by @xmath35 , if @xmath33 can be obtained from @xmath34 by permuting some of its rows and/or columns . for later use , we state a simple property of incidence matrices of a hypergraph .",

    "moreover , any matrix that is permutation equivalent to @xmath36 is the incidence matrix of @xmath1 with respect to some pair of orderings of its vertices and edges .",
