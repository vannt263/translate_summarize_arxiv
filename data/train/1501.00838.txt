    "the kpz problem @xcite describing the growth in time of an interface in the presence of noise have been the subject of intense investigations during the past almost three decades @xcite . during last five years",
    "the major progress in solving this problem has been achieved which resulted in derivation of the exact solutions for various types of the free energy probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i would like to consider the possibility to apply the ideas and technique developed in the studies of the kpz problem for formally equivalent problem of the randomly forced burgers turbulence ( the `` burgulence '' problem ) .",
    "here one considers a velocity field @xmath0 governed by the burgers equation @xmath1 where the parameter @xmath2 is the viscosity and @xmath3 is the gaussian distributed random force which is @xmath4-correlated in time and which is characterized by finite correlation length @xmath5 in space : @xmath6 $ ] . here u(x ) is a smooth function decaying to zero fast enough at large arguments and the parameter @xmath7 is the injected energy density . in this problem",
    "one would like to derive e.g. the the probability distribution functions of the velocity gradients @xmath8 $ ] or two - points distribution function @xmath9 $ ] at scales smaller than the length scale @xmath5 of the stirring force @xmath10 ( see e.g. @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "formally the above problem is equivalent to the kpz equation as well as to the ( 1 + 1 ) directed polymers . indeed , redefining @xmath11 and @xmath12 one gets the kpz equation for the interface profile @xmath13 ( which is the free energy of ( 1 + 1 ) directed polymers ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the temperature parameter of the directed polymer problem and @xmath16 is the gaussian distributed random potential .",

    "the only `` little problem '' is that unlike the usual kpz studies operating with the @xmath4-correlated in space random potential , in the burgulence problem one is mainly interested in the spatial scales comparable or much smaller than the random potential correlation length @xmath5 . in other words , in this approach , first one has to study kpz problem with random potentials having _ finite _ correlation length . in the present study ( as a matter of `` warming up '' exercise ) i m going to consider another `` extreme case '' in which the random potential @xmath16 of the kpz problem is changed by it s linear approximation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is gaussian distributed random force",
    "in this case we obtain the model introduced by larkin @xcite long time ago to study small scale displacements of directed polymers . in this approximation",
    "the model becomes gaussian and therefore exactly solvable .",
    "nevertheless , the statistical properties of its free energy ( as well as some others quantities ) turn out to be rather non - trivial ( see e.g @xcite ) . for that reason this model hopefully could serve as a good ground for testing various approaches developed in the recent kpz studies .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and formulate the main ideas of the replica approach which will be used in the further calculations of the two - time free energy distribution functions ( for the directed polymer model ) and the corresponding velocity distribution function ( in the burgulence problem ) . in section iii as the matter of the demonstration of the replica technique the explicit expression for the two - time ( two - point ) free energy distribution function is derived . in section",
