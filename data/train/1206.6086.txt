    "heavy ion collision experiments at rhic typically create a medium where the net baryon density is non - vanishing  @xcite . as we enter a new era of precision measurements , it is therefore important to consider the effect of a non - vanishing baryon chemical potential on the thermal photon yield of the quark gluon plasma . previously , the effect of non - zero chemical potential in @xmath2 processes was studied in @xcite .",
    "the complete leading order calculation of photon production including the effect of collinear enhancement in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases was first carried out by arnold , moore , and yaffe ( amy ) starting from first principles within the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite , however , is mostly carried out at zero chemical potential .",
    "the effect of adding a chemical potential was mentioned , but a detailed analysis was not fully performed .",
    "the chemical potential will modify the quark and gluon self - energies as well as change the statistical factors , thereby potentially modifying the power counting analysis of amy . in this paper",
    ", we will precisely determine under which circumstances the power counting must be modified to account for the presence of a chemical potential .",
    "we also explore numerically the consequences of including a chemical potential in the photon production .    as in the previous cases ,",
    "the most convenient basis to work in when analyzing the parametric sizes of diagrams is the keldysh or @xmath5 basis whereas the rates are most conveniently written in the usual @xmath6 basis .",
    "the addition of a finite chemical potential also changes the way in which we switch from the @xmath6 basis to the @xmath5 basis , and we will carefully explain the required changes .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sect : g1122 ] , we briefly recall the structure of perturbation theory in the real time formalism and outline the basic formula giving photon production in terms of feynman diagrams . in section [",
    "sect : heinz_and_wang ] , we show how to generalize a result of heinz and wang  @xcite that allows one to express green functions in the @xmath6 basis in terms of a reduced set of green functions in the @xmath5 basis . in section [",
    "sect : hard_thermal_loops ] , we show how a finite chemical potential alters quark and gluon thermal masses .",
    "then , in section [ sect : power_counting ] , we perform a power counting analysis to determine which diagrams contribute at leading order in the strong coupling @xmath7 and resum these in section [ sect : resummation ] .",
    "finally , some numerical results are shown in section [ sect : numerical_results ] .",
    "we start by briefly outlining the structure of real time perturbation theory at finite chemical potential .",
    "since we are interested in a qcd plasma , our starting point is the qcd lagrangian : @xmath8 where the sum is over the @xmath9 fermion flavors and the gauge group is @xmath10 with @xmath11 .. ] this lagrangian has a conserved charge @xmath12 which is equal to the net fermion ( quark ) number .",
    "the density operator describing the grand - canonical ensemble is therefore @xmath13 . in the imaginary time formalism",
    ", one can show that this changes the matsubara frequencies from @xmath14 to @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential here is hence the _ quark _ chemical potential which is 1/3 of the baryon chemical potential .",
    "to connect the imaginary and real time formalisms , one defines the retarded and advanced propagators : @xmath16 the anticommutators above are replaced with commutators for gauge fields . by using the spectral representation of imaginary time propagators ( for instance , see @xcite ) one can show that the retarded propagator is obtained by analytically continuing the matsubara propagator through the prescription @xmath17 and the advanced propagator from the continuation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an arbitrary real number .    in the real time formalism , one is forced to double the degrees of freedom because when constructing a generating functional from the partition function , the time integration contour has to traverse the real time axis once forward and backwards ( schwinger - keldysh closed time path ) @xcite .",
    "the first set of fields @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 corresponds to fields with a time argument on the forward directed part of the contour and conversely the set of fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 corresponds to fields with time arguments on the backwards directed part .    for computational purposes ,",
    "it is sometimes more convenient to use another basis than the @xmath6 basis above .",
    "one such basis is the @xmath5 or keldysh basis @xcite , defined as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes any of our fields . by using the above algebraic relation and the spectral representation of propagators in the @xmath5 basis",
    ", one can show that for fermions : @xmath28 the above allows us to compute real time propagators by analytically continuing imaginary time ones . from now on ,",
    "we use capital letters for 4-momenta and lower case letters to denote the magnitude of the 3-momenta .",
    "for instance , @xmath29 in the above expressions and @xmath30 .    to tie this formalism to the problem of photon production , we recall the standard formula that relates the emissivity of the plasma to a wightman current - current correlator @xcite @xmath31 where we have defined the wightman current - current correlator by : @xmath32 wightman functions are most naturally expressed in the @xmath6 formalism of the real time theory : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a fermionic four - point function where two external vertices are of the ` 1 ' types and the others are of the ` 2 ' types .",
    "the `` parallel '' component of @xmath35 is always defined relative to the fixed direction of the emitted photon momentum @xmath36 .    a schematic diagram for @xmath37 is shown in figure  [ fig : momenta_assignments ] .",
    "our convention is that fermion momenta flow into the shaded box .",
    "arrows going into the shaded box correspond to insertions of the particle operator @xmath38 , and arrows coming out of it correspond to antiparticle insertions @xmath39 .          for power counting and actual computations ,",
    "the @xmath5 basis is more convenient than the @xmath6 basis . by using the algebraic relation between fields in the @xmath6 and @xmath5 bases ( c.f .",
    "eq.([eq : def_ra_basis ] ) ) , we can express @xmath34 as a linear combination of the sixteen possible four - point functions in the @xmath5 basis .",
    "the result is : @xmath40 one can show that in general , @xmath41 , and hence we can immediately eliminate one of the sixteen terms in the above ",
    "see for example @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "wang and heinz showed that the remaining 15 terms can be re - expressed in terms of seven four - point functions and their complex conjugates .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite only considered the case of a real scalar field .",
    "however , their derivation works equally well for fermions  see appendix a. hence the following results from the reference still holds @xmath42 with the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 composed of fermi - dirac distribution functions instead of bose - einstein distribution functions and @xmath45 denoting the charge conjugate ( @xmath46 ) of @xmath47 . here",
    "all @xmath48 are functions of 4 momenta .",
    "our convention is that the momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspond to the insertion of @xmath38 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the insertion of @xmath53 .",
    "this expression greatly reduces the number of diagrams we need to estimate . as a matter of fact , what emerges from our power counting analysis is that only @xmath54 contributes to photon production at leading order .",
    "this is because only this labeling gives rise to pinching poles as we will explain shortly .",
    "thus , we only need to know the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these are given by @xmath57 this is proven in appendix a. one can intuitively understand the signs of @xmath58 in the above by recalling that @xmath59 is the distribution function for particles while @xmath60 is the distribution function for antiparticles . since @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to antiparticle insertions , they must be associated with the distribution @xmath61 , and conversely for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    as we will discuss in section",
    "[ sect : power_counting ] , all gluon exchange momenta must be soft at leading order in the strong coupling @xmath7 . therefore",
    ", we have that @xmath62 in figure [ fig : momenta_assignments ] .",
    "hence , @xmath63 and @xmath64 and consequently , @xmath65 .",
    "further , one can verify that @xmath66 see appendix b. therefore , only the real part of @xmath54 is relevant to photon production at leading order .",
    "when we compute the wightman correlator to derive the photon production , we need to do a power counting analysis to identify all leading order diagrams . in this analysis ,",
    "the appearance of `` pinching poles '' makes it crucial to resum the thermal self - energies into the quark and gluon propagators .",
    "therefore , we need to know how the presence of a chemical potential affects the self - energies of quarks and gluons .",
    "this is well - known and dates back to the original paper by braaten and pisarski on hard thermal loops @xcite .    in order to keep our work self -",
    "contained , we review the derivation of self - energies with a full inclusion of a chemical potential in appendix c. in this section , we simply quote the final results .    the gluon polarization tensor at finite chemical potential @xmath58 takes the form : @xmath67 where in the above , @xmath68 is the debye mass , and @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , the quark self - energy at finite chemical potential is : @xmath71    the above two results show that the only effect of the chemical potential is to shift the dependence of self - energies on @xmath72 by a @xmath73 term .",
    "as we will see , the consequence of this is that in carrying out our power counting analysis , we need not alter the arguments of arnold , moore , and yaffe as long as @xmath74 .",
    "when evaluating the wightman function , there are two regions of the spatial part of the loop momentum integration that are of interest .",
    "* the non - collinear region : @xmath75 and @xmath76 are both @xmath77 . * the near - collinear region :",
    "@xmath75 or @xmath76 is @xmath78 or less .",
    "the non - collinear region corresponds to the contributions of the basic @xmath79 processes treated by kapusta et al .",
    "@xcite and baier et al . @xcite .",
    "the near - collinear region will have both pinching pole and near - collinear enhancements .",
    "it corresponds to the contribution of the bremsstrahlung and inelastic pair annihilation processes modified by the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect .",
    "we briefly review how pinching pole enhancements arise . as will be shortly shown ,",
    "the leading order diagrams for photon radiation all contain a pair of fermionic propagators as shown in figure [ fig : pinching_poles ] .",
    "the spatial part @xmath35 of the loop momentum @xmath80 is assumed to be nearly collinear with @xmath36 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath81 .    .",
    "we assume that @xmath82 is nearly collinear with @xmath80 and that the other parts of the diagram are essentially constant over the region of width @xmath83 centered around the pinching poles of the integrand.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    given that we impose the collinearity of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we may focus just on the frequency integral @xmath84\\left[\\left(p^0+k^0-\\frac{i\\gamma_{{\\mathbf{p}}+{\\mathbf{k}}}}{2}\\right)^2-e_{{\\mathbf{p}}+{\\mathbf{k}}}^2\\right ] } \\label{eq : freq_int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have absorbed the dirac matrix structures into the vertices . in eq.([eq : freq_int ] ) , @xmath85 is the decay width of the quark generated by the imaginary part of the self energy . to leading order in @xmath7 ,",
    "it can be replaced by its asymptotic value @xmath86 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the poles of the integrand are at the following locations : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath89 when @xmath90 are @xmath77 and collinear .",
    "hence the two pole positions @xmath91 and @xmath92 almost coincide at @xmath93 although they are located on opposite halves of the contour ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : contour_pinch_aligned ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath36 are nearly aligned .",
    "the poles above the real line belong to @xmath94 and the ones below belong to @xmath95 .",
    "the integration contour is along the real axis .",
    "we see that two of the poles nearly coincide at @xmath96 .",
    "these poles are said to `` pinch '' the integration contour.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we use the residue theorem to close the contour and pick up the contributions of the poles located below the real axis .",
    "for the case where @xmath97 , this gives : @xmath98 when @xmath99 , the factors in the denominators should be replaced by the general expression @xmath100 therefore , the frequency integral is approximately : @xmath101 but @xmath102 and @xmath103 are both of order @xmath104 , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are hard .",
    "hence , we get a @xmath105 enhancement from the frequency integral .",
    "these enhancements make a large class of diagrams contribute to leading order even though we would naively expect them to be subleading .",
    "suppose that in the above demonstration we had not taken the integrand to be the product of an advanced and a retarded propagator but rather @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "then all poles would have been on one side of the frequency integration contour only and we could have closed it on the side with no poles . since the contribution from great circles at infinity vanishes , this means that the integral would vanish . hence pinching",
    "pole enhancements only arise when we have a retarded and an advanced propagator .",
    "this is the reason why only @xmath54 contributes to the leading order photon production .",
    "due to the fact that there is no @xmath108 propagator ( c.f .",
    "eq.([eq : gaa ] ) ) and that an interacting vertex must contain an odd number of @xmath109-fields  @xcite , any other labelling leads to reduction of the number of pinching poles .",
    "we will illustrate general power counting arguments by estimating the size of the ladder diagram shown in figure  [ fig : ladder_diagrams ] .",
    "we start with the ladder diagram that has only a single rung ( figure [ fig : one_rung_ladder ] ) .",
    "notice that the assignment of the @xmath5 indices ensures we have a retarded and an advanced propagator in each pair of quark propagators .",
    "propagator.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    to get a pinching pole enhancement , we need that the quark with momentum @xmath80 be nearly collinear with the emitted photon .",
    "further , if the gluon carries a soft exchange momentum @xmath110 , then it can not disturb the collinearity of the quark with the emitted photon .",
    "therefore , the second pair of propagators also gives a pinching pole enhancement .",
    "so we have a @xmath111 enhancement .",
    "a soft gluon @xmath112 propagator is of order @xmath113 because of the bose - einstein factor , _",
    "provided @xmath114_. however , a soft gluon also brings in a phase space suppression of order @xmath115 which cancels this enhancement .",
    "gathering all powers , we have for suppressions :    * @xmath116 from the integral over @xmath117 which is @xmath118 since this is the near collinear regime . * @xmath115 from the soft @xmath119 spatial integral over @xmath119 . * @xmath116 from two gluon exchange vertices . * @xmath116 from the @xmath120 factor arizing from the contraction with the external photons .    and for enhancements :    * @xmath111 from two pinching pole enhancements . * @xmath121 from the soft gluon propagator .",
    "adding up all powers of @xmath7 , we get that this two - loop diagram is of order @xmath116 , the same as the non - collinear one - loop diagram .",
    "the above analysis easily extends to ladder diagrams with an arbitrary number of rungs .",
    "each additional rung brings with it one more pinching pole enhancement , giving a @xmath122 , and a soft gluon propagator of order @xmath121 .",
    "it also brings in a @xmath115 suppression from the spatial integral over the new soft gluon momentum and a @xmath116 suppression from the two additional gauge boson exchange vertices . adding these up",
    ", we get a net contribution of @xmath123 , so that at least all ladder diagrams contribute to leading order .",
    "one ought to make an important remark at this point .",
    "since the thermal mass of the gluon goes roughly as @xmath124 , the spectral function can be of higher order than @xmath122 if @xmath58 is of order @xmath125 .",
    "in this case , the size of the soft @xmath112 gluon propagator fails to cancel the @xmath115 phase space suppression that we get from a soft gluon loop momentum .",
    "consequently , all ladder diagrams are subleading when @xmath126 , and it becomes unnecessary to resum the contributions of all ladder diagrams .",
    "the rest of the power counting analysis aims at identifying which combinations of external @xmath5 indices contribute at leading order , showing that all other diagram topologies are subleading , and also proving that gauge boson momenta of order higher or less than @xmath127 also give subleading contributions .",
    "as we have argued , as long as @xmath128 , the size of the propagators comprising each diagram is parametrically the same as in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we will not pursue it here in more detail .",
    "in the regime where @xmath114 , the power counting analysis of @xcite is unchanged . therefore , the conclusion that one needs to resum ladder diagrams ( and only these ) to get the photon emissivity to leading order is also valid .",
    "hence , we can apply the same resummation procedure as @xcite . here",
    "we briefly outline that resummation procedure .",
    "graphically , the sum we need to evaluate is illustrated in figure [ fig : graph_opt_d ] .",
    "sums all ladder diagrams with one photon vertex removed .",
    "all external legs are amputated.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    we have defined the photon resummed vertex @xmath129 as the sum of all ladder diagrams with the leftmost photon vertex and pair of quark propagators removed . from figure",
    "[ fig : graph_opt_d ] , one sees that each ladder is constructed from the previous one by concatenating a gluon rung attached to two quark - gluon vertices and a pair of quark propagators to the previous one , where the quark propagators must be evaluated at the location of pinching poles .",
    "the ladder diagrams form a geometric series .",
    "@xmath130 the graphical operator @xmath131 adds the pinching pole pair of propagators . in the above equation",
    ", each @xmath132 contributes a pair of pinching poles : @xmath133\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the operator @xmath134 adds the rung as illustrated in figure  [ fig : graph_opt_m ] @xmath135     adds a pair of propagators evaluated at the location of the pinching poles .",

    "adds a pair of propagators evaluated at the location of the pinching poles .",
    "the rung @xmath134 adds a soft gauge boson propagator . ]    finally , @xmath136 is the bare photon vertex on the far end of the ladder diagram as illustrated in figure [ fig : graph_opt_i ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the resummed vertex @xmath137 then satisfies the following integral equation : @xmath138 after defining the variable @xmath139 , the integral equation ( [ eq : int ] ) becomes @xcite : @xmath140\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after applying a sum rule , the collision kernel @xmath141 is found to have the simple form @xcite @xmath142 with @xmath143 and @xmath144 strictly colinear .",
    "the term @xmath103 is the difference between the locations of the pinching poles of the quark propagators , as seen in eq.([eq : pinch_difference ] ) . through the energies of the quarks , it includes their asymptotic thermal masses @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , the chemical potential enters through both @xmath146 and @xmath145 . recall that @xmath147    finally , the contribution of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes to the wightman correlator ( and thus to the photon emissivity ) is given by : @xmath148\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\times\\mathcal{i}^{\\mu}(p , k){\\mathrm{re}}[\\mathcal{f}(p , k)\\mathcal{d}^\\nu(p , k)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "this finding is consistent with the behavior of the @xmath2 emission rates .",
    "one of the reasons for this enhancement turned out to be just the statistical factors in eq.([eq : wightman ] ) .",
    "these factors represent 3 different processes depending on the sign of @xmath19 and the relative sizes of @xmath158 and @xmath159 . to illustrate the effect of non - zero @xmath58 in each of the three processes , consider the following ratio of the statistical factors in eq.([eq : wightman ] ) and the same statistical factors with @xmath156 .",

    "hence the rate is enhanced . this reflects the fact that a positive chemical potential enhances the number of quarks more than the pauli - blocking factor reduces the emission rate .",

    ", a positive chemical potential reduces the phase density of anti - quarks but enhances the pauli - blocking factor .",
    "but since pauli - blocking can never be enhanced above 1 , the effect is to reduce the photon emission rate .",
    "the combined effect of quark bremsstrahlung and anti - quark bremsstrahlung is a net enhancement as shown in figure  [ fig : brem ] .    for @xmath162 and @xmath166 ,",

    "[ fig : annih ] , we show the contribution of the annihilation process to the photon emission rate for various values of @xmath58 .",
    "among these three effects , the enhancement of the quark - bremsstrahlung dominates because it increases much faster than the reductions in the annihilation contribution and the anti - quark bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore , overall , the effect of having @xmath170 is to enhance the photon production at the same temperature as shown in figures  [ fig : photon_plot_restricted ] and [ fig : photon_plot ] .",

    "let us define the symbol @xmath211 to be equal to @xmath169 if the space - time point @xmath212 has a @xmath209 operator insertion at it , or @xmath213 if it has a @xmath38 insertion . with this notation",
    ", we obtain the following generalization of the kms boundary condition to @xmath214-point functions : @xmath215 finally , we use the well - known formula @xmath216 to obtain : @xmath217    we are allowed to take the @xmath218 operator outside of the time - ordering symbol provided we take time - ordering to be given by the @xmath219 prescription .",
    "that is , the time - ordered @xmath214-point function is _ defined _ to be the path integral of the product of the @xmath214 operators weighted by the exponential of @xmath220 times the action . for a discussion of this prescription , see for example @xcite .",
    "we define the `` tilde conjugate '' @xmath221 of a green function @xmath47 to have same @xmath6 index assignment but with the time - ordering symbols reversed .",
    "therefore , we can express our previous result as : @xmath222    in @xcite , wang and heinz use the fact that in momentum space , tilde conjugation is equivalent to complex conjugation .",
    "as this is a key fact , we proceed to extend it to fermion fields at finite chemical potential . for notational simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the case where there are four fermion operators two of which bear `` @xmath169 '' indices , and the other two of which bear `` @xmath199 '' indices .",
    "although this is not necessary for this discussion , we have also included the @xmath223 matrices which appear in the current - current correlator [ eq : current_current ] .",
    "extensions to other cases should be obvious .",
    "@xmath224 taking a complex conjugation and changing @xmath225 , we obtain : @xmath226 next , we make use of @xmath227 invariance . recall that the dirac bilinear @xmath228 transforms as follows under the anti - unitary @xmath227 transformation @xmath229 : @xmath230 then , using anti - unitarity , thermal expectations of a product of fields can be related as follows : @xmath231 we have used @xmath227 invariance in commuting @xmath229",
    "past @xmath232 and relabeling the eigenstates @xmath233 .",
    "further , note that the sign of @xmath58 changes as we commute @xmath229 past @xmath207 . combining the above with our previous result , we obtain :",
    "@xmath234 where @xmath45 denotes the charge conjugate ( @xmath46 ) of @xmath47 .",
    "recapitulating , we have the two equations : @xmath235 the above can be taken as the starting point to reproduce the derivation of heinz and wang",
    ". however , the latter also uses the energy conservation condition @xmath236 and the identity @xmath237 . in order for the derivation of heinz and wang to proceed in the same manner",
    ", we need suitable generalizations of these to treat fermions at finite chemical potential . by charge conservation",
    ", we must have that @xmath238  in other words , the green function in question must have an equal number of @xmath209 and @xmath38 insertions to not vanish .",
    "therefore , we can define @xmath239 and maintain `` energy conservation '' @xmath240 .",
    "also , by performing the customary replacement @xmath241 , we preserve the relation @xmath237 since @xmath242 in general .    the only relations among the @xmath243 s that heinz and wang use is energy conservation , and the only property of the bose - einstein distributions they use is @xmath237 .",
    "this is because after they have used the kms condition like we have done above , their work consists of algebraic manipulations such as solving large systems of equations involving the bose - einstein distribution . in their work , it is possible to treat @xmath47 and @xmath244 as independent variables rather than considering the real and imaginary parts of @xmath47 .",
    "hence , it causes no harm to their derivation to replace @xmath244 by @xmath245 as is required by .",
    "we conclude that we could in principle perform the exact same manipulations as heinz and wang by relabeling every @xmath246 as @xmath247 .",
    "the net result is that we make the same replacements in their final results , bearing in mind that @xmath209 insertions come with a @xmath248 and @xmath38 insertions come with @xmath249 .    in reference",
    "@xcite , heinz and wang obtain @xmath250 and @xmath251 by making the replacements we have prescribed above , we get : @xmath252 and @xmath253 as required .",
    "in this appendix , we want to show that @xmath254 .",
    "it is sufficient to prove the corresponding identity in position space . @xmath255",
    "in this appendix , we closely follow the zero @xmath58 analysis in @xcite to compute self - energies in the hard thermal loop approximation with a finite chemical potential .",
    "consider first the gluon self - energy @xmath256 .",
    "the color structure of this tensor is trivial , so that @xmath257 .",
    "we have four diagrams to consider : the quark loop , the gluon loop , the gluon tadpole , and the gluon ghost .",
    "only the quark loop is affected by the presence of a chemical potential and hence we make it the focus of our attention . with all momenta labeled , this diagram is shown in figure [ eq : quark_loop ] .",
    "our strategy is to evaluate this diagram in the imaginary - time , invert it to get the gluon propagator , and then analytically continue the result to retarded frequencies to get the real - time @xmath258 propagator from which all other propagators in the @xmath5 basis may be obtained . proceeding ,",
    "we first get : @xmath259 in the above , the integration measure is @xmath260 , where @xmath261 is the spatial momentum integration measure .",
    "since we have factored out the color structure of the gluon self - energy , there is no sum over @xmath109 in the @xmath262 factor .",
    "further , @xmath263 is the fermionic loop momentum and @xmath264 is the difference between the momentum of the gluon ( @xmath265 ) and the virtual quark .",
    "the frequency @xmath266 is bosonic , and the frequency @xmath267 is fermionic .",
    "the color matrices @xmath268 are the generators of @xmath269 in the fundamental representation . in this representation ,",
    "the group factor @xmath262 is simply @xmath270 .",
    "@xmath271 denotes the fermion propagator time evolved using the `` thermodynamics hamiltonian '' @xmath272 since this is what satisfies the periodic boundary condition ( see appendix a for kms conditions at finite @xmath58 ) .",
    "the cleanest way to compute the above is to use the spectral representation @xmath273 indeed , this expansion of the propagator makes the frequency sum trivial . after performing the spin trace and employing standard identities involving the fermi - dirac distribution ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath274 for the spatial component of the self - energy tensor , the result is @xmath275\\label{eq : spatial_gluon__pol_quark_loop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath276 .",
    "the above expression holds for arbitrary external momenta .",
    "henceforth , we only consider the hard thermal loop approximation so that @xmath277 after the analytic continuation @xmath278 has been performed .",
    "it turns out that the self - energies in the hard thermal loop approximation are also valid for arbitrary external momenta @xmath80 at the one loop order @xcite .",
    "hence , we will freely use our results as the self - energies of the gluons and quarks when estimating the size of their propagators .",

    ", we have @xmath283 .",
    "thus , we finally obtain the hard thermal loop part of the gluon polarization tensor .",
    "@xmath284    by going through the same analysis , we can evaluate the other components of the gluon polarization tensor . if we include the contributions of the three other loops , we finally have : @xmath67 where in the above",
    ", @xmath68 is the debye mass , and @xmath69 .",
    "the contribution of the quark loop to the gluon self - energy corresponds to the screening of the strong interaction by quarks in the medium .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that the chemical potential of the quarks will have an influence on the repeated scattering events that occur during the photon emission process .",
    "the chemical potential also appears explicitly in the quark propagator and thus affects the thermal mass of the quarks .",
    "this will affect the integral equation that we will derive for photon production , so we turn to computing the self - energy of the quarks .",
    "the relevant diagram is shown in figure [ fig : quark_self_energy ] .          in the above",
    ", @xmath286 denotes a sum over bosonic frequencies followed by an integration over the spatial part of @xmath119 . as usual , @xmath287 where @xmath288 is the identity matrix in @xmath269 . in the coulomb gauge",
    ", we find : @xmath289 where we have used the spectral representation of the longitudinal and transverse part of the coulomb gauge gluon propagator following @xcite .",
    "here @xmath290 .",
    "the above shows explicitly that we have three contributions to the quark self energy : @xmath291 .",
    "the term @xmath292 is the contribution of the @xmath293 term in the longitudinal piece of the gluon propagator .",
    "this corresponds to the instantaneous coulomb interaction term .",
    "explicitly , it takes the form : @xmath294 once again , using the spectral representation of the fermion propagator , we obtain : @xmath295 this has no term proportional to @xmath296 .",
    "thus , we will not pursue its computation any further , but we will rather focus on the transverse part . as for the longitudinal part , @xmath297 at tree level , so that it gives a vanishing contribution  this is not true for dressed propagators , and in particular , @xmath298 does contribute to the quark damping rate . after employing the spectral representation of the fermionic propagators , we obtain for the transverse self - energy : @xmath299",
    "retarded boundary conditions are obtained from the above by taking the analytic continuation @xmath300 . simplifying the dirac structure and applying the hard thermal loop approximation as in the gluon self - energy calculation , we get : @xmath71 with @xmath301 .",
