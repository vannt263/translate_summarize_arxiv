    "the photometric and spectral variability has been established as a characterizing feature of supergiant stars already a few decades ago ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , affecting virtually all luminous stars during their post - main sequence evolution .",
    "the light variations appear to be cyclic , characterized by semi - regular , rather than strictly periodic , patterns , obeying a semi - period  luminosity  color relationship ( @xcite , @xcite ) analogous to the relation valid for cepheids , with timescales ranging from a few days ( early b supergiants ) to hundreds of days ( red supergiants ) .",
    "the maximum light amplitudes , on the order of 0.1 mag , increase with stellar luminosity , and reach in the hot star domain a local maximum for early - b supergiants ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of photometric micro - variations on scales @xmath0 mag typifies variable massive oba supergiants , or @xmath1  cyg variables following the general catalogue of variable stars ( @xcite ; see also reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a semi - period  luminosity  color relationship suggests pulsational instabilities as the driving mechanism for the observed variability , where stochastic processes determine the quasi - regularity .",
    "several clues , including the large discrepancy between the theoretical periods for radial pulsations in the fundamental mode and the observed ones ( @xcite , @xcite ) , together with color variations smaller than predicted ( @xcite ) , indicate that non - radial oscillations are at work in blue supergiants ( @xcite , @xcite ) , possibly appearing in connection with evolutionary stages past the red supergiant phase ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "alternative or additional mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed photometric and spectroscopic variability , such as orbital motions in binary systems ( @xcite ) . in the case of late - b and early - a supergiants the variability of spectral line profiles originating in the photosphere is consistent with non - radial pulsation modes , while rotational modulation appears to be affecting the extended stellar wind regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the physical reasons for the observed variability , which concerns both the photospheric layers ( as deduced from the photometric variations ) and the extended winds of blue supergiants ( from time series spectroscopic investigations , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , it is interesting and necessary to determine its relevance when considering the use of blue supergiant stars as stellar candles ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite have discussed the preliminary calibration of the flux - weighted gravity  luminosity relationship ( fglr ) and its potential use as an extragalactic distance indicator .",
    "as originally proposed , such a relation applies to late - b to early - a supergiants , which belong to the visually brightest stars in galaxies , thus allowing tests of its validity to be carried out in galaxies located well beyond the local group .",
    "both the fglr and the wind momentum  luminosity relationship ( wlr , @xcite ) rely on the measurement of the apparent visual magnitude of blue supergiants , which are then transformed to bolometric luminosities from knowledge of the spectral type .",
    "an assessment of the reliability of such methods should involve tests concerning their sensitivity to time - dependent stellar properties , such as the mass - loss rate ( for the wlr ) , and to the above mentioned photometric micro - variations ( fglr and wlr ) .",
    "` normal ' ( non - lbv ) blue supergiants have been rarely monitored for variability beyond the magellanic clouds . in this paper",
    "we report on a medium - term ( five months ) _ v _ monitoring program of blue supergiants in the galaxy ngc  300 .",
    "the main motivation for this work is to demonstrate that the fglr is insensitive for all practical purposes to the micro - variations normally observed in b and a supergiants .",
    "the photometric measurements for the ngc  300 blue supergiants included in this study have been extracted from images obtained at the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope on la silla , equipped with its wide field imager 8k@xmath28k mosaic camera .",
    "these multi - epoch observations are part of the _ bvri _ cepheid monitoring program described by @xcite , where details on the calibration and the data reduction can be found . the data discussed in the current paper span the period 1999 july 312000 january 8 , covered by observations on 28 different nights , mostly under photometric conditions , roughly grouped in five blocks of data separated by temporal gaps up to 43 days long .",
    "only the _ v_-band temporal sequence will be discussed here ( _ b_-band magnitudes have a somewhat less reliable calibration , but still show variations similar to those observed in _ v _ ) .",
    "spectra of blue supergiants in ngc  300 have been obtained with the fors1 multi - object spectrograph at the eso very large telescope by @xcite , and we restrict the following analysis to the spectroscopically confirmed b- and a - type supergiants . for the individual stars we adopt the nomenclature introduced in the spectral catalog presented in that paper .",
    "the standard deviation from the mean magnitude and the maximum light amplitude were taken as a measure of the stellar variability .",
    "we selected stars having small dispersion in magnitude to serve as comparison stars in order to define the observational uncertainty , @xmath3 , as a function of magnitude .",
    "we then arbitrarily retained for further analysis only those objects for which @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ sigma ] ) . a selection based on the maximum light amplitude generates a similar sample of stars .",
    "this procedure is justified since we are not aiming at a complete compilation of variable supergiants in ngc  300 , but instead at an analysis of those spectroscopically confirmed supergiants displaying the largest variability , since these will have a maximum effect on the fglr .",
    "the 16 stars satisfying the selection criterion are labeled in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] with the identification number introduced by @xcite .",
    "their mean apparent _ v _ and absolute @xmath5 magnitudes , @xmath6 colors , standard deviations in the @xmath7 magnitude @xmath8 , maximum light amplitudes a@xmath9 and spectral types are summarized in table  [ variables ] .",
    "@xmath5 s have been determined assuming a distance modulus @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , and estimating the reddening ( and the extinction with @xmath11 ) based on the difference between the observed @xmath6 and the expected color index for the given spectral type .",
    "the photometric measurements differ slightly ( mostly at the 0.01 - 0.02 mag level ) from those in table  2 of @xcite , as a result of improved zero - points and photometry .",
    "all stars in table  [ variables ] are blue supergiants ( early - b to mid - a ) , with the exception of a5 , a red supergiant , which shows the largest light variation among the detected variables , apparently occuring over a period longer than our observing window . the wn11 ( or ofpe / wn9 ) star b16 analyzed by @xcite also appears in table  [ variables ]",
    ".    the _ v _ light curves of the selected variable stars are displayed in fig .  [ lightcurve ] . despite the gaps in the temporal sequence , photometric variations occuring on timescales of tens of days can be easily detected in most cases , often superimposed on variations at higher frequency .",
    "the periodicity of the photometric sequences has been analyzed utilizing the phase dispersion minimization algorithm introduced by @xcite , as implemented in the iraf astronomical data reduction package .",
    "our goal was simply to check whether semi - periods comparable in length to those of galactic and magellanic cloud supergiants could be found also in ngc  300 , aware of the fact that the irregular sampling of the data within our observing window is far from being optimal for an accurate frequency analysis .    only for two stars",
    "a clear isolated minimum in the @xmath12 statistics ( which is defined to vary between 0 and 1 , see @xcite ) is unambiguously identified , leading to a reasonable determination of the semi - periods .",
    "such is the case of d12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 days ) and a10 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 days ) , both of spectral type a2ia , shown in the phase diagrams of fig .",
    "[ phase ] ( the uncertainty in the quoted periods is on the order of 10% ) . for the remaining stars in the sample @xmath12 lies between 0.4 and 0.75 , and a unique semi - period determination was not possible , with multiple phase dispersion minima occuring at periods roughly between a few days and 30 - 40 days .",
    "the phased light curves for these stars display a large amount of scatter , but this is typical of the light variations of blue supergiants , as multiple pulsation modes can be excited in blue supergiants ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the semi - periods found for the two a2 supergiants d12 and a10 , of absolute magnitude @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , are roughly twice as long as those listed for similar stars in the milky way by @xcite .",
    "fundamental periods calculated from the respective stellar parameters are 42 days ( d12 ) and 27 days ( a10 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the findings of the previous sections confirm that the typical photometric micro - variability of blue supergiants , known from studies in the milky way and the magellanic clouds , is also found in our ngc  300 sample .",
    "the advantage of these data from the extragalactic point of view is that they allow us to carry out a simple but important test concerning the effect of the stellar variability on the fglr . given the typical amplitude of the broad - band photometric variations , @xmath190.1 mag , it is reasonable not to expect a significant effect , but a quantification of its size is desirable .",
    "the fglr , introduced by @xcite , expresses the proportionality between the bolometric magnitude of a blue supergiant and its flux - weighted gravity during its evolution across the hertzprung - russell diagram at roughly constant luminosity :      where @xmath21 , with slope and zero - point fixed by a preliminary calibration , based on the stellar parameters determined for stars in different galaxies : milky way , magellanic clouds , ngc  6822 , m31 , m33 , ngc  300 and ngc  3621 .",
    "it is not clear whether during the semi - periodic light variations the bolometric magnitude remains rigorously constant .",
    "if that were the case , then the fglr would be unaffected by the blue supergiant variability . on the other hand",
    ", one could imagine that the detected light variations are symptomatic of small changes in the total luminosity ( as in the pulsating massive star models by @xcite ) . in this case , and lacking additional constraints , we can test the corresponding effect on the fglr by determining the relationship at different epochs , letting @xmath22 vary by an amount equal to the broad - band variability .",
    "the flux - weighted gravity @xmath23 is kept constant , since spectra for the derivation of gravity and @xmath24 are available for one single epoch only , and therefore we have no way of estimating their possible variations .",
    "only spectral time series would allow us to verify if and how the stellar parameters change during the cyclic changes .    under these assumptions , we have calculated slope and zero - point of the fglr at each available epoch , using our photometric temporal sequence for the ngc  300 blue supergiants considered by kudritzki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , i.e.  14 stars of spectral type between b8 and a2 .",
    "the stellar parameters for these stars , as calculated by kudritzki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , are summarized in table  [ fglrstars ] , and the whole set of @xmath7 magnitudes at 28 different epochs is given in table  3 ( the uncertainty of the individual measurements is on the order of 0.010.02 mag ) .",
    "_ the zero - point and rms of the linear fit are found to be affected below the 10% level , when compared with the regression shown for ngc  300 stars alone ( @xmath250.2 mag ) by kudritzki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with variations in the slope only up to 4%_. it is clear that the supergiant variability introduces a negligible effect on the resulting fglr , which will remain negligible even when an improved calibration of the relation , including its possible dependence on the stellar metallicity , will become available in the near future .    in conclusion , the fglr appears to provide an extragalactic distance indicator which is robust against supergiant photometric variability , provided that the number of stars considered per galaxy is sufficiently large ( @xmath2610 ) . as for the future work , besides improving the calibration in terms of statistics and metallicities , additional efforts are required to establish whether spectral variations are important for the derivation of the stellar parameters .",
