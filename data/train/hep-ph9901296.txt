    "formation of defects during symmetry breaking phase transitions has found increasing attention in a variety of applications ranging from condensed matter systems to cosmological scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the idea to consider baryons as topological defects in an @xmath3-component chiral meson field @xmath4 constrained by @xmath5 const .",
    "@xcite , similarly has initiated attempts to estimate multiplicities of baryon and antibaryon production in high energy events or heavy ion collisions from the dynamics of defect formation during the cooling phase of an expanding hot hadronic gas  @xcite@xcite .",
    "there are strong theoretical indications that during this cooling process the chiral @xmath6 symmetry is spontaneously broken near a critical temperature @xmath0 , and since the critical temperature is estimated to be of the order of the pion mass @xmath7 ( @xcite and refs . therein ) , it may appear sufficient to describe this chiral transition in the framework of low - energy effective theory for the mesonic fields @xmath4  @xcite",
    ". however , perturbative methods for the evaluation of the relevant effective potential near the critical temperature are probably not very reliable , the role eventually played by other degrees of freedom is not really understood , so at present it is not even clear whether this chiral transition would be first or second order ( see e.g. the discussion in  @xcite@xcite ) .    in analogy to phenomena observed in condensed matter systems",
    "there also have been speculations about the simultaneous ocurrence of extended domains with different average orientation of the aligned field ( disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) ) which rearrange into a uniform vacuum on a much longer time scale and therefore could manifest themselves through anomalous branching ratios for the production of differently charged mesons  @xcite . evidently , the existence of differently oriented domains and defect formation are intimately related , especially if the defects are of topological type which can not simply disappear from a field configuration by local unwinding .    depending on the physical system under consideration the nature of the defects",
    "is determined by the choice of the manifold on which the fields live  @xcite : if the constraint @xmath8 const .",
    "is enforced , the fields live on the @xmath9-dimensional sphere @xmath10 , conveniently parametrized by angular variables .",
    "this embedding can provide defects with a topologically protected winding number and thus in case of the chiral field allows to identify them with baryons .",
    "near the phase transition , however , it may be appropriate to relax the constraint and allow all @xmath3 components of @xmath11 to move independently .",
    "then a euclidean @xmath12 embedding appears most convenient and in fact , the possible formation of dcc s in the chiral phase transition has been investigated in this framework  @xcite .",
    "the winding number of a field configuration embedded in @xmath12 is , however , not topologically conserved : it will undergo discrete changes , if at some space - time point all field components vanish , i.e. if the field configuration moves across the origin @xmath13 .    in order to preserve the identification of winding number with baryon number it is necessary to insist on the angular nature of the chiral field , while the additional degree of freedom is picked up by the modulus @xmath14 , the scalar @xmath15-field .",
    "in other words , the topologically trivial @xmath12 embedding is replaced by the @xmath16 manifold with nontrivial homotopy group @xmath17 . here",
    "the origin @xmath18 is excluded as a highly singular branch point where different angular sheets are tied together . any field configuration which moves across this point , leaves a defect or antidefect of winding number @xmath19 at the spatial position where this happens , which remains connected to the rest of the moving field by a string .",
    "the spatial structure of string and defect are determined by the dynamics of the classical field .",
    "the nontrivial structure of the modulus of @xmath11 along the string constitutes the bag , which interpolates from the vacuum value of the @xmath15-field surrounding the defect to a ( small ) value in its center where the angular fields change rapidly from one sheet to the next . for a simple 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 model",
    "this has been discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "these considerations naturally pose two questions : how do different embeddings affect the average multiplicities of defects and antidefects and the possible existence of disoriented domains during the chiral transition ? and : what is the influence of the spatial structure of the topological defects ( as determined by the temperature - dependent effective action ) on their production multiplicities and on the possible formation of large extended disoriented domains",
    "?    one may hope that for the essential features of defect formation the order of the transition is not very important .",
    "if the transition is first order then it would proceed through nucleation of bubbles  @xcite , which in their interior are characterized by an aligned chiral field with nonvanishing average value @xmath20 of the chiral field as determined through the nontrivial minimum of the effective potential near @xmath0 .",
    "the orientation of the aligned field in different bubbles could be considered as random , so the average distance of their centers can be taken as an initial correlation length @xmath21 at @xmath0 .",
    "this length provides the relevant scale for defect formation , irrespective of its physical size . on this scale",
    "the total volume @xmath22 considered can be identified with the total number of bubble seeds near @xmath0 .",
    "growth and coalescence of bubbles then leads to the formation of topological defects within a typical formation time @xmath23 characteristic for the damping of local fluctuations .",
    "decisive for the multiplicity of the created defects is the ratio between their spatial extent , i.e. the radius or winding length @xmath24 of the defects at the time of their formation and the correlation length @xmath21 .",
    "the winding length is determined by the stabilization mechanism supplied through the effective action for the average field .",
    "if the winding length @xmath24 is much smaller than the correlation length the defects can be considered as pointlike on the scale @xmath21 .",
    "then the purely combinatorial rules  @xcite of random lattices apply for their formation , i.e. their average density @xmath25 is given by the kibble limit [ kibble ] n=(n_++n_-)/v=(2)^-d_d where @xmath26 is the number of defects plus antidefects , @xmath27 is the space dimension , and the factor @xmath28 is the average ratio of the numbers of @xmath27-simplices and vertices in a large random lattice , i.e. @xmath29 etc .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the random field fluctuations during the typical time @xmath23 get transformed into a rather dense ensemble of defects and antidefects .",
    "these may become diluted in the following due to annihilation processes on a much larger timescale .    if , however , the value of the winding length @xmath24 is larger than the average distance of the bubble seeds , then stabilization dynamics will prevent the formation of pointlike defects and antidefects inside the volume occupied by large extended stable defects or antidefects and ( [ kibble ] ) has to be replaced by [ modkib ] n=(n_++n_-)/v = ( 2)^-d_d .",
    "i.e. before they have a chance to form , point defects and antidefects get instantly ( i.e. within time @xmath23 ) eaten by big stable solitons which carry the net winding number of the chiral field within the volume occupied by them .",
    "the formation of these large extended solitons is a direct process which does not proceed through multiple annihilations of smaller defects .",
    "if for a sudden quench ( @xmath30 ) the effective potential at @xmath31 is established before any dynamical or dissipative mechanism can affect the initial random field configuration then the winding length @xmath32 near @xmath31 will be relevant for the size of the cold defects formed . with the relevant scale still given by the initial correlation length or average bubble distance @xmath21 near @xmath0",
    ", the ratio @xmath33 will enter into ( [ modkib ] ) .",
    "if typical quench times are much larger than the formation time ( @xmath34 ) then the number of initially created defects and antidefects will be given by ( [ modkib ] ) with winding length @xmath24 characteristic for @xmath35 .",
    "subsequent changes in the defect multiplicities during the continuation of the quench depend on the scaling behaviour of their winding length : if @xmath32 decreases with the decreasing temperature ( as in three spatial dimensions where @xmath24 scales like @xmath36 ) then the ( initially small ) number of ( initially large ) defects stays small , so the multiplicity remains near the ratio @xmath37 in ( [ modkib ] ) . on the other hand , if @xmath32 increases during the quench ( as in one spatial dimension where @xmath24 scales like @xmath38 ) , the growing defects swallow many of the defect - antidefect pairs , so at the end of the slow quench the resulting multiplicities are the same as for a sudden quench , i.e. determined by the ratio @xmath33 .",
    "if the transition is second order no bubbles appear and the average distance between bubbles should be replaced by an instantaneous correlation length @xmath39 . for finite rate of cooling",
    "@xmath39 remains finite near @xmath0 because critical slowing down prevents response over large distances  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "@xmath40 stays close to zero which ( in 3 dimensions ) implies large @xmath24 .",
    "so also in this case the relevant winding lengths may exceed the pertinent correlation length of the plasma , so defect multiplicities can be much smaller than the limiting value given by eq .",
    "( [ kibble ] ) .",
    "defect formation is intimately related with the size of dcc domains .",
    "if the transition proceeds in a way as to form a dense gas of pointlike defects and antidefects according to the kibble limit ( [ kibble ] ) , then domains of topologically trivial mesonic field which fill the remaining space between the different defects consequently have to be small ( in units of @xmath41 ) . with increasing ratio @xmath42 the number of defects created decreases rapidly according to ( [ modkib ] ) , but the chiral field in the spatial domains separating the defects is correlated due to the large winding length of the defects which organize  the field surrounding them . in both limiting cases there seems to be little room for large ( in units of @xmath41 ) domains of aligned but randomly oriented locally trivial field configurations .",
    "the actual physical size of these domains , of course , still depends on the magnitude of the basic length scale @xmath41 in physical units ; this , naturally , depends on the physical system considered and on the order of the transition . for the hot chiral gas in the chirally symmetric phase above @xmath0 numbers for @xmath41 typically quoted range from 0.5 fm to 1 fm .",
    "on a lattice with a lattice constant of that size individual cold baryons will cover just one lattice unit or less , while on formation near @xmath0 the melted baryons  @xcite may smoothly extend over a large number of cells .",
    "we therefore expect a situation where the above considerations about the relevance of the winding length typically apply .    for a discussion of the chiral phase transition in the framework of",
    "effective meson fields it is therefore necessary to embed the fields in a manifold which allows for the topological protection of winding number , i.e. to use a separation into angular field variables and one modulus @xmath15-field .",
    "practically , in lattice simulations , where topological arguments no longer apply , conserving algorithms have to be used for the updating of configurations during their evolution .",
    "we will describe the results of such simulations for the 1d-@xmath1 model in section ii , for the 2d-@xmath2 model in section iii .",
    "it is expected that the bias introduced into the initial configurations through explicit chiral symmetry breaking provides another efficient mechanism to suppress defect formation  @xcite .",
    "this effect should be discussed in connection with the evolution of the @xmath15 field .",
    "we shall concentrate here on the interplay between winding length and defect densities . because the winding length is mainly determined by the dynamics of the angular field variables we postpone a detailed discussion of features related to the evolution of the modulus @xmath15-field and , correspondingly , use unbiased initial configurations only .",
    "some of these features can be nicely visualized in the simple @xmath1 model in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "as discussed above we concentrate here on the relation between winding length and defect density . to define the notation and for completeness we repeat some facts discussed in  @xcite concerning the topologically trivial @xmath43 vs. nontrivial @xmath44 embedding .",
    "defects arise as stable static solutions for the effective lagrangian density taken in the standard @xmath45 form ( summation over @xmath46=1,2 and @xmath47=0,1 understood ) [ lagrange ] l_0 ( ) = _ _ a ^_a + ( ^2 - f^2)^2 - h _ 1 . the term @xmath48 in ( [ lagrange ] ) breaks chiral @xmath1 symmetry explicitly . in order to keep the minimum of the potential for finite @xmath49 at the @xmath49-independent value @xmath50 we define f^2 = f^2_0 - .",
    "in accordance with conclusions from 1-loop renormalization group applied to ( [ lagrange ] ) we will take @xmath51 and @xmath49 as temperature independent , while @xmath40 decreases as @xmath52 rises from @xmath31 towards @xmath53 .",
    "the cartesian components @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) define the euclidean @xmath43 embedding of this model , while modulus field @xmath15 and the angular variable @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) related to @xmath4 through [ sigpi ] _ 1(x , t)=(x , t)(x , t ) ,   _ 2(x , t)=(x , t)(x , t )",
    "define the embedding into the @xmath58 manifold .",
    "the @xmath15- and @xmath59-masses corresponding to these fields are [ masses ] m_^2= ,  m_^2=2 _ c f_0 ^ 2 + m_^2 .",
    "a convenient unit for dimensionful quantities is the temperature - independent symmetry breaker @xmath49 of mass dimension 2 .",
    "so , in the following , if numbers are given for dimensionful quantities , they are to be multiplied by appropriate powers of @xmath49 .    in the euclidean @xmath43 embedding the static part of ( [ lagrange ] ) leads to stable nontopological solitons as long as the inequality [ ineq ] f_0 ^ 3 > 21.28 is satisfied .",
    "otherwise , the only stable solution is the trivial ground state @xmath60 .",
    "this corresponds to approximately @xmath61 , as stability condition . for a typical coupling strength @xmath62 ( which we use in the following ) this implies @xmath63 . on the other hand , in @xmath44 , the winding number @xmath64 of topologically nontrivial field configurations with fixed angular boundary conditions @xmath65",
    ",  ( @xmath66 integer ) [ bnum ] b=_-^ ( x , t ) dx = n_+-n_- , is topologically conserved . for values of @xmath40 below the limiting value ( [ ineq ] ) the angular field @xmath56 of nontrivial static configurations collapses into pointlike defects at some position @xmath67 , while the modulus field @xmath15 describes a spatially extended bag profile satisfying [ radeq ] ",
    "-_c ( ^2-f^2)+h=0 @xmath68 the radius of this bag scales approximately like @xmath69 . therefore , with @xmath70 small near @xmath0 , where the stability condition ( [ ineq ] ) is not satisfied and the angular field collapsed to a point defect , the bag radius still is comparable to the angular winding length @xmath71 of the soliton , which solves the static @xmath1 model ( [ lagrange ] ) , if the constraint @xmath72 is enforced , i.e. , if we simply consider a u(1 ) model on a circle @xmath73 .    on the other hand , if the stability condition ( [ ineq ] ) is satisfied , the static solutions of the @xmath1 model in @xmath43 and in @xmath44 embedding coincide . because the modulus field of these configurations stays close to @xmath70 , the corresponding angular field essentially also coincides with the soliton of the model constrained to the circle @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "statistical ensembles of these stable solutions are expected at the end of a cooling process that evolves from an initial ensemble of random configurations with correlation length @xmath41 .",
    "the quench is defined through the variation of @xmath40 with time . for a numerical simulation the initial configurations before the onset of the quench we choose",
    "gaussian deviates in the field components @xmath75 , at the points @xmath76 of a spatial grid of total length @xmath77 with lattice constant @xmath41 which defines the correlation length or distance of bubble seeds near @xmath0 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed by choosing @xmath78 . from these random values of the cartesian field components the initial configuration of the angular field @xmath79 is obtained by taking the shortest path from the angle at point @xmath80 to the angle at a neighbouring point @xmath81 .",
    "this guarantees that the absolute value of the increment in the angle from one point to the next is always less than @xmath59 .",
    "due to the periodic boundary conditions in the cartesian field components the difference in the angular field @xmath82 then is an integer multiple of @xmath83 , which defines the winding number @xmath64 of that particular random initial configuration .",
    "as we discussed above the winding length of nontrivial solutions in different embeddings is similar to the winding length of the model with the modulus of @xmath11 constrained to @xmath84 .",
    "the essentials of the relation between defect winding length and defect density therefore can also be observed within the simple u(1 ) ( or nonlinear @xmath1 ) model .",
    "as an example we consider the sudden quench where the initially prepared configurations are exposed at time @xmath85 to the effective action with constant @xmath86 .",
    "then , within relaxation time @xmath23 , the configurations evolve into an ensemble of stable defects with winding length @xmath87 . in fig.1",
    "the average final density @xmath25 of defects plus antidefects averaged over an ensemble of 100 random initial configurations selected with total winding @xmath88 on an @xmath89=1000 lattice is plotted against the symmetry - breaking mass @xmath7 .",
    "the region where @xmath7 is less than @xmath59 is essentially characterized by a linear rise of the density @xmath25 as expected from ( [ modkib ] ) for @xmath90 . beyond this value",
    "the winding length becomes comparable to the lattice constant @xmath41 and we observe the onset of saturation with @xmath25 slowly converging towards the kibble limit ( [ kibble ] ) of @xmath91 ( for @xmath90 ) .",
    "a peculiar feature is that the increase in the number of finally surviving defects and antidefects with decreasing winding length proceeds in quite well - defined plateaus which are very robust against details of the evolution algorithm .",
    "note that the absolute number of defects in the ensemble underlying fig.(1 ) is rather large : e.g. in the sudden decrease of @xmath25 just below @xmath92 a total average number of @xmath93 defects are eaten by a tiny increase of the winding length , while in the region ( @xmath94 ) mainly empty space in between defects is reduced .",
    "evidently , this is an indication of a lattice effect : as we have noted , if @xmath7 drops below @xmath59 the defects start to grow beyond one lattice unit .",
    "as expected , for very small values of @xmath7 the average density is again rather smooth .",
    "altogether , we may conclude that the experiment confirms the expectation expressed in ( [ modkib ] ) .",
    "the squares connected by a full line in the left lower corner of fig.1 show average defect densities as calculated in the unconstrained @xmath1 model in euclidean @xmath43 manifold .",
    "the theoretical limit of defect stability here ( for @xmath95 ) is close to @xmath96 .",
    "however , in the finite lattice calculation the defects disappear already near @xmath97 . beyond that value",
    "the resulting defect densities are zero , while in the region of stability the average densities closely follow the linear rise as obtained in the @xmath98 model .",
    "irrespective of the stability condition , for the unconstrained @xmath1 model embedded in @xmath99 , the defect densities are similar to those of the @xmath98 model for all values of @xmath7 . however , in the region of instability where ( [ ineq ] ) is violated , average multiplicities in @xmath44 embedding slightly exceed the @xmath98 results due to the smaller size of the radial bag ( depending on the choice of @xmath51 ) ( cf .",
    "( [ masses ] ) ) .",
    "relations between winding length @xmath24 of defects and formation of dcc domains can not be addressed within the @xmath1 model , because the strength of the symmetry breaker necessary for finite @xmath24 prevents local alignment in random directions .",
    "outside the range of the defects the angle @xmath56 stabilizes always at multiples of @xmath83 .",
    "we therefore turn to the @xmath2 model whose additional freedom allows to at least discuss partial aspects of dcc formation .",
    "corresponding to our discussion of the constrained @xmath1 model we consider in this section only that version of the @xmath2 model where the modulus of @xmath11 is constrained to a fixed value @xmath70 .",
    "in two spatial dimensions @xmath70 is of mass dimension 1/2 , so we use appropriate powers of @xmath100 as units for all dimensionful quantities",
    ". then the fields @xmath11 are unit vectors @xmath101 which live on the sphere @xmath102 and conveniently are parametrized by two angles @xmath103 and @xmath56 @xmath104 if @xmath101 converges towards a fixed unit vector , say @xmath105 , for spatial infinity on @xmath43 ( sufficiently fast for the energy to converge ) then the configuration space for smooth fields is disconnected due to the nontriviality of the second homotopy group @xmath106 .",
    "individual configurations then are characterized by the winding number @xmath64 and local winding density @xmath107 [ b ] b= d^2x , [ rho ] _",
    "j ) ( summation over spatial indices @xmath108 understood ) .",
    "we consider the effective energy functional [ baby ] e [ ] = ( _ i _ i + ^2 ^2 + ( -)^2 ) d^2x .",
    "evidently , @xmath109 serves to scale the spatial extension of stable solutions , as it can be eliminated by @xmath110 . both terms in @xmath111 , the @xmath112 ( skyrme ) term and the explicitly symmetry - breaking last term , are necessary to stabilize solitons ( the baby skyrmions  @xcite ) with fixed winding length @xmath113 . for our present purpose to study the relation between @xmath24 and average defect densities created in a symmetry breaking transition it is therefore sufficient to impose the quench through an appropriate time dependence of @xmath109 .",
    "discretizing the spatial coordinates to a two - dimensional lattice , the limit @xmath114 will produce defects which are pointlike on the scale of the lattice constant , while @xmath115 will create smooth density distributions which extend over many lattice units .",
    "a characteristic problem arises in numerical simulations on a discrete lattice if the spatial extent of solitons is of the order of a few lattice constants or even less : this implies , that differences in the angles @xmath103 and @xmath56 between neighbouring lattice points may be of the order of @xmath59 . in that case the definition ( [ rho ] ) for the winding density @xmath107 no longer applies .",
    "it is only for infinitesimally small differentials that the surface element @xmath116 on @xmath102 which is the image of the elementary lattice cell @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 .",
    "but it is essential to maintain also for finite lattice constants the geometrical meaning of @xmath116 as the surface area which the image of the unit lattice cell cuts out from @xmath102 .",
    "this can be readily implemented by defining @xmath119 as the ( oriented ) area of the spherical triangle which is cut out on @xmath102 by the three geodesics which connect the end points of three @xmath120-vectors attached to three corners of an elementary lattice cell .",
    "this works for arbitrary relative orientations of these @xmath120-vectors and allows even to detect one complete soliton inside one elementary lattice cell may differ by @xmath121 , i.e. the winding number may differ by @xmath19 .",
    "however , for the ensemble average , this is not relevant . ] .",
    "clearly , this definition reduces to ( [ rho ] ) in the continuum limit .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( which compactify @xmath43 to a torus ) , or @xmath122 ( which compactifies @xmath43 to @xmath102 ) then lead to integer values of the total winding number @xmath64 obtained by summing up all oriented spherical triangles .    the topological considerations which guarantee conservation of @xmath64 for continuous fields do not hold on the discrete lattice , because @xmath120-vectors attached to neighbouring points on the lattice can differ arbitrarily . however , @xmath64-conservation can easily be re - implemented into the evolution of the configurations by allowing in each updating step only configurations only in the local vicinity of the points which are affected by the update . ] which conserve @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , this is a convenient way to compare evolutions which conserve @xmath64 with others that allow for local unwinding of defects .",
    "so it is also not necessary to introduce specific types of potentials ( see e.g.  @xcite ) into ( [ baby ] ) to avoid the exceptional configurations  @xcite as doorways for unwinding .    for the first term in ( [ baby ] )",
    "there is no similar compulsory extension to finite lattice constants because it is not of geometrical nature .",
    "so , as usual we just interprete it as nearest neighbour interaction .",
    "having thus defined the implementation of the model ( [ baby ] ) on a discrete lattice which conserves those features essential for our present purpose , it remains to specify the initial configurations before the onset of the quench .",
    "again we postpone here the question of any possible bias which may exist in these initial sets due to explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "instead we choose a uniformly random set of @xmath120-vectors on all interior lattice points . only on the boundaries we impose @xmath123 , i.e. @xmath124 with random @xmath56 .    in the following sense",
    "this initial random set realizes the maximal average number of defects which can be accommodated on this square lattice : first it should be noted that by definition of our map ( which maps a triangle formed by two adjoining orthogonal lattice links and the diagonal connecting their endpoints onto the interior of the _ smaller _ of the two complementary spherical triangles formed by the corresponding geodesics on @xmath102 ) the image triangle covers always _ less _ than half of the sphere , and thus by definition does not contain a defect .",
    "so , this is different from the kibble mechanism which allows for defects inside elementary triangles by considering an additional lattice point inside the triangle .",
    "however , if we add the ( oriented ) areas covered by the two adjoining images of both triangles which make up the elementary square lattice cell then it may happen that this sum covers more than half of the sphere , and by definition we then may count that as one defect inside this elementary lattice cell .",
    "in fact , if @xmath109 is very small , such a configuration will rapidly evolve into a configuration where the sum of these two spherical triangles ( which represent the image of the lattice cell ) is close to @xmath125 .",
    "we may call this the kibble limit for the square lattice .",
    "it differs from the triangular limit ( [ kibble ] ) by a factor @xmath126 ( in two dimensions ) , which we interprete as a difference in the definition of the correlation length @xmath41 by a factor of two for uniformly random configurations on the vertices of a square lattice , as compared to the original kibble counting which uses one additional point with random field asignment inside each of the two triangles which constitute the elementary square lattice cell .",
    "we consider the identification of @xmath41 with the lattice constant for a random asignment of field vectors to each vertex of the square lattice as the natural definition of the correlation length .",
    "this basic setup opens a wide variety of dynamical situations for systematic investigation . as just one example we shall discuss here only the case of a linear quench in the scale parameter @xmath109 [ quench ] = _ i+ t   ( 0 t t_q ) with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "starting from the initial random set , at the beginning of the quench a large value of @xmath129 attempts to establish long range order with very small values of the local winding density @xmath107 . when @xmath109 approaches values aound @xmath130 to @xmath131 , individual defects start to be formed out of this more or less organized low - density soup .",
    "near the end of such a quench , for very small @xmath109 we expext an ensemble of @xmath132 defects and @xmath133 antidefects each essentially localized on a single lattice cell .",
    "for @xmath134 the evolution can still be continued with @xmath135 to allow for final stabilization of the defects formed , or for possible mutual annihilations on a much longer time scale .    after the onset of the quench ordering of the configurations proceeds within typical relaxation times @xmath23 and the extent to which the ordering can spread before the local defects appear is governed by the ratio @xmath136 , which is the appropriate measure for the quench velocity . for a fast quench we expect the final defect density to be close to our modified kibble limit discussed above , because most of the initial random ( incomplete ) winding",
    "will directly evolve into complete local @xmath125 winding . for slow quenches",
    "the random winding will have time to be smoothed away into large areas of low winding density , before finally a few defects and antidefects reappear .",
    "this naturally provides the appropriate setting to investigate formation and size of dcc domains .",
    "there is , however , a severe limitation to this discussion , also within the model ( [ baby ] ) : the stabilization mechanism of the baby skyrmions relies on a strong symmetry breaker , the last term in ( [ baby ] ) .",
    "this term prevents formation of large areas of aligned but randomly oriented field configurations if we consider the complete field vectors @xmath120 . in the spatial domains outside the range of the topological defects the field",
    "will essentially be aligned in @xmath137 direction .",
    "still , a partial aspect of dcc formation can be studied : in the so called easy plane orthogonal to @xmath137 , the field components @xmath138 and @xmath139 can freely align in random directions and the partial correlation function [ corr ] c(|2 - 1|)=<(1)(2)+(1)(2 ) > ( where the arguments 1,2 stand for two arbitrary lattice points ) provides the information about the size of aligned domains .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the aligning force in the easy plane due to the first term in ( [ baby ] ) ( the nearest neighbour interaction ) is active only in areas where @xmath140 .",
    "this means that the formation of dcc domains can only be studied during the early parts of the quench where the strength of the symmetry breaker is not yet sufficient to form small localized defects with strictly aligned ( in @xmath137 direction ) domains in between .",
    "as soon as these local defects appear ( around @xmath141 ) the disoriented aligned areas in the easy plane begin to re - randomize due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "so , the formation of dcc domains is closely connected to small but non - vanishing winding density , which by itself is an interesting aspect .    in the following",
    "we describe some results of numerical simulations on a 51@xmath14251 lattice with an ensemble of random initial configurations which , however , have been selected as to satisfy @xmath88 . of course",
    ", other values of @xmath64 can be selected to study a possible influence of the total winding number .",
    "the algorithm conserves @xmath64 as discussed above . for illustration we present two intermediate steps in the evolution of one specific arbitrary configuration during a fast quench ( @xmath143 timesteps ) and a slow quench ( @xmath144 timesteps ) .",
    "the first set shows the situation shortly before @xmath145 crosses the value of @xmath130 , i.e. just before localized defects begin to form .",
    "the corresponding correlation functions ( [ corr ] ) in fig.2 indicate that the ordering in the easy plane has hardly progressed beyond one lattice unit during the fast quench , while it extends beyond five lattice units after the slow quench .",
    "this becomes very evident if we look ( in figs.3 ) at the field @xmath11 projected into the easy plane and normalized to unity in the easy plane ( i.e. the components of the arrows in the plot simply are @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) .",
    "this provides an instant view of dcc domains and defects and it shows that for the fast quench a high density of nascent defects leaves no space for large aligned domains while during the slow quench a well - developed dcc - pattern emerges .",
    "the corresponding winding density distributions @xmath107 display a rough surface ( fig.4a ) versus essentially smooth areas of low density with few emerging local spikes ( fig.4b ) . finally , figs.5 show the resulting ensemble of defects shortly after the end of the quench where @xmath109 has reached its final value of @xmath148 and the local defects have stabilized . counting the final number of defects and antidefects which evolve from this particular initial configuration we find @xmath149 for the fast ( @xmath150 )",
    "quench and @xmath151 for the slow ( @xmath152 ) quench .",
    "evolving @xmath153 = 50 randomly chosen ( but selected for @xmath88 ) initial configurations through the quench ( [ quench ] ) leads to an ensemble of defects and antidefects for each quench time @xmath154 as shown in fig.6 .",
    "the modified kibble limit as discussed above for the square lattice is @xmath155 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( @xmath156 ) reduce this value to about 144 for this lattice size . for the sudden quench ( @xmath157 )",
    "the measured numbers approach a mean value of only about 133 due to a few instant annihilations . for increasing quench time the defect numbers drop to a mean value of about 32 near @xmath152 as indicated by the full line in fig.6 which connects the mean values for the different quench times .",
    "the root mean square deviation from the average values decreases from about @xmath158 for the sudden quench to @xmath159 near @xmath152 . of course , these details depend on the specific choice of the quench mechanism used here . for applications to specific physical situations",
    "the appropriate temperature dependence of the effective action and temporal structure of the quench has to implemented .",
    "the purpose of this note is to study the influence of the spatial extent of topological defects on their formation during a dynamical quench in a symmetry breaking phase transition .",
    "apart from the combinatorial factors of the kibble mechanism it is the ratio of the momentaneous magnitude of the winding length @xmath24 ( as determined by the temperature dependent effective classical lagrangian ) to the correlation length @xmath41 near @xmath0 which is essential for the resulting multiplicities of defects and antidefects .",
    "this leads to a crucial role of the quench time on the scale of the relaxation time @xmath23 typically needed for defect formation .",
    "if during the early part of the quench the winding length is large on the scale of @xmath41 , the resulting defect multiplicities are much reduced as compared to the combinatorial kibble limit for pointlike defects .    as illustration we presented numerical simulations in the nonlinear 1d-@xmath1 and 2d-@xmath2 models which are characterized by a topologically conserved winding number @xmath64 , in view of applications where this number corresponds to a physically relevant observable . for the lattice simulation",
    "it is essential to implement the geometrical meaning of the winding density for the discrete map .",
    "then boundary conditions on angular variables still serve to enforce integer values for @xmath64 , although topological arguments for @xmath64-conservation no longer apply .",
    "however , by explicit control during the evolution @xmath64-violating steps can be excluded .",
    "if conservation of @xmath64 is an important feature of the physical system under discussion , like baryon number conservation in chiral meson field models , extensions to the linear versions of @xmath6 models have to include the additional degree of freedom in the form of a modulus variable in an @xmath160 embedding . for comparison",
    "we have briefly discussed the topologically trivial @xmath43-embedding of the linear @xmath1 model .",
    "unfortunately , in these low - dimensional models , the winding length of defects is closely tied to explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "this leads to a dramatic difference between euclidean and angular embedding if the symmetry breaking is sufficiently strong to destabilize nontrivial configurations .",
    "the same feature also hampers the investigation of dcc domains in these low - dimensional models .",
    "it is only in the easy plane of the @xmath2 model where partial aspects of randomly oriented alignment can be observed .",
    "it has been argued that the bias introduced into the ensemble of initial configurations ( for @xmath161 ) by explicit symmetry breaking causes another drastic reduction of defect multiplicities .",
    "this interesting aspect has been omitted here , again for the same reason that the symmetry breakers simultaneously have to serve as stabilizers for the defects .",
    "of course , the real challenge is the formation of 3d-@xmath162 skyrmions as a nonperturbative model of how baryons emerge in the cooling of the hot meson soup . in that model stabilization of defects and explicit symmetry breaking through small mesonic masses",
    "are almost unrelated .",
    "therefore all the interesting features concerning winding length , formation of dcc domains , effects of the modulus field , baryon number conservation , bias in the initial ensemble , all can be studied quite independently with the same methods used here for baby skyrmions .",
