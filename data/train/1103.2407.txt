    "three types of metal - insulator transitions have been observed in nickel oxides .",
    "the first one occurs in the rnio@xmath0 perovskites , by changing the r cation .",
    "lanio@xmath0 is a paramagnetic metal with enhanced correlations , but as the size of the lanthanide cation is increased , the series of rnio@xmath0 ( with r = y and from sm to lu in the lanthanide series ) are insulators that undergo a temperature induced metal - insulator transition,@xcite with the metal - insulator transition temperature ( accompanied by a transition to a low - temperature antiferromagnetic state ) grows as the r - o bond length increases.@xcite this transition is accompanied of a charge - ordering ( or at least charge disproportionation ) phenomenon , that has been observed in various members on the insulating side of the transition.@xcite    a second type of metal - insulator transition has been observed very recently in ultrathin films of lanio@xmath0 grown as multilayers on laalo@xmath0@xcite and also as thin films.@xcite in the multilayered case , spectroscopic studies showing a double peak structure developing in the insulating cases suggest the appearance of charge - order in the ni layer , similar to what happens in bulk rnio@xmath0 perovskites for certain types of rare earth other than la , as discussed above .",
    "it is likely that charge order is the origin of the insulating behavior in the case of thin films as well , but no spectroscopy has been performed yet to shed light on the cause of the insulating behavior observed .",
    "a similar phenomenon of charge disproportionation has been reported very recently@xcite at the interface between two srtio@xmath0 thin films when a monolayer of ro is grown at the interface , where r can be various lanthanides .",
    "it turns out that for the la case the interface is metallic , but for y and the other lanthanides it is insulating , due to a similar phenomenon of charge ordering as in perovskite nickelates .",
    "the third type of metal - insulator transition that has been experimentally observed in nickelates appears in the layered ruddelsden - popper series for n=2 and 3 , i.e. la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath9 and la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath11.@xcite la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath12 and la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath13 are both paramagnetic metals.@xcite however , at a certain value of @xmath3 , a doping - induced metal - insulator transition takes place .",
    "experimentally , various doping levels have been reached , up to la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath14 and la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath15 , showing this metal - insulator transition.@xcite in principle , a mott - transition could take place at the ni@xmath4 valence ( la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath16 or la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath17 ) , making those systems already insulating .",
    "this has to do with the formation of a ni@xmath4:d@xmath18 electronic state , which in an octahedral environment would form a s=1 state with an e@xmath8@xmath19 electronic configuration .",
    "the e@xmath8@xmath20 band will be fully occupied leading to a gap opening if the hund s coupling is larger than the bandwidth of the e@xmath8 bands and no big distortion from octahedral environment occurs that would split the otherwise degenerate e@xmath8 bands",
    ".    the situation would be reminiscent of what happens on la@xmath1nio@xmath10 , which also , by electron count , has nominally ni@xmath4 cations .",
    "the material shows insulating behavior at low temperature , and also a peculiar type of metal - insulator transition at high temperatures , that has been explained by goodenough@xcite as a splitting in the semi - itinerant d@xmath21 band that opens up a gap , with the d@xmath7 behaving always as localized electrons , according to his picture .",
    "how far the insulating region reaches in @xmath3 values will depend on how quick metallicity is reached when the insulating system is doped with either holes or electrons .",
    "experiments show that even la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath22 ( formal valence ni@xmath23 ) is an insulating compound,@xcite suggesting that the insulating phase is difficult to destroy by doping , more difficult than in the case of cuprates , probably due to the relatively small polaron size in doped nickelates .",
    "below , we will discuss the distinctions compared to layered cuprates that might help explaining this difference in behavior .",
    "the use of these low - valence layered nickelates has been recently suggested as a possible way to mimic the electronic structure of superconducting cuprates.@xcite    other ni@xmath4 insulating compounds have been found , e.g. lanio@xmath24 , with a superstructure based on the perovskite unit cell.@xcite when lowering the valence below ni@xmath4 , the layered nickelates that have been synthesized remain insulating .",
    "experiments on recently synthesized la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25@xcite show it is an insulator with antiferromagnetic ( af ) order that leads to a peculiarity in the susceptibility at high fields . in the case of la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25",
    ", an unusual type of molecular insulating state has been used to understand its electronic and magnetic properties,@xcite where the quantum confinement of the nio@xmath1 trilayers leads to a bonding - antibonding splitting that creates an insulating state with a correlated molecular origin .",
    "below , we will see how a similar picture applies to la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 , which is also insulating , but no af order has been observed down to 4 k.@xcite    even lower ni valence layered compounds exist and again a crossover from insulating to metallic state occurs as valence is reduced .",
    "the infinite - layer lanio@xmath1 has been synthesized , with single - valent ni@xmath26:d@xmath27 cations,@xcite showing a paramagnetic metallic behavior .",
    "electronic structure calculations show the origin of the metallicity of this compound and study the differences with the isoelectronic parent compounds of the high - temperature superconducting cuprates.@xcite",
    "we have studied the n= 2 members of the ruddelsden - popper@xcite series la@xmath28ni@xmath29o@xmath30 , with reduced oxygen content , to explore the regime of ni valencies around 2 + .",
    "these structures are characterized by the presence of two nio@xmath1 layers separated by a block of fluorite la / o@xmath1/la layer that produces the confinement of the nio@xmath1 bilayer in the structure ( see fig .",
    "[ structs ] ) and determines the valence .    as the oxygen content",
    "is varied , so does the ni coordination . in the insulating phase la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ structs ] ) , the ni environments are square planar . however , in the metallic la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath13 , every ni is in an octahedral oxygen environment ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ structs ] ) . on going from one oxygen content in the metallic limit to the other in the insulating side of the transition , apical oxygens need to be removed , that would otherwise be in the ni bi - layer . in the intermediate case , la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath16",
    ", we see that the reduction of oxygens leads to a mixture of octahedral and square - pyramidal environments .",
    "structures used for the calculations in the insulating and metallic limits were taken from refs . .",
    "for the relaxation of the intermediate structure , we have considered the possible apical oxygen removals and compared their total energies , leading to the structure presented in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ structs ] . in our calculations , we have studied an ordered alternation of octahedra and square pyramids .",
    "such an ordering need not happen in the real compound , but it is a specific way to calculate its electronic structure using a simple unit cell .",
    "one should keep in mind that the positioning of two neighboring square pyramids along the c - axis would change the d@xmath7-d@xmath7 @xmath31-bonding that has crucial consequences in the electronic structure of the compound ( see below ) . when analyzing the possible bonding - antibonding splittings",
    "produced by such a structure , it is important to keep in mind that a random distribution of square pyramids and octahedra would modify them .",
    "our electronic structure calculations were performed within density functional theory@xcite using the all - electron , full potential code wien2k@xcite based on the augmented plane wave plus local orbital ( apw+lo ) basis set.@xcite the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) was used for the structure optimization of the @xmath3= 0.5 compound for various ways to obtain that oxygen content starting from @xmath3= 0 . to deal with strong correlation effects",
    "we apply the lda+u scheme @xcite including an on - site repulsion u and hund s coupling j for the ni @xmath32 states .",
    "results that we present are not dependent on the specific values of u and j within a reasonable range , and we report results with u = 4.75 ev , j = 0.68 ev , values very similar to those determined from constrained density functional calculations@xcite for a similar layered nickelate .",
    "la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 has been studied experimentally recently , and also using ab initio calculations.@xcite the system shows largely insulating behavior that can be described by a variable range hopping model .",
    "no magnetic ordering is found down to 4 k. the calculations presented in that paper report only metallic results , hence they do not provide an understanding of the observed insulating behavior of the compound . in our recent paper,@xcite we describe the origin of the insulating behavior of the similar compound la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25 as being due to the gap opening that is produced by a bonding - antibonding splitting of the d@xmath7 bands closest to the fermi level .",
    "this comes about due to the spatial confinement of the nio@xmath1 trilayers in the compound . in the case of la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 ,",
    "the structure presents a nio@xmath1 bilayer , but the situation becomes similar to la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25 .",
    "figure [ bs_326 ] shows the band structure of the compound , with the different ni e@xmath8 states highlighted , calculated within the lda+u scheme . due to the square planar environment of the ni@xmath6 cations ( assuming a simple electron count with the usual valences for o@xmath33 anions and la@xmath34 cations ) , a large crystal - field splitting inside the ni e@xmath8 doublet is expected , with the d@xmath7 lying lower in energy .",
    "we can see this situation comparing the two band structures shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ bs_326 ] .",
    "it is not clear what spin - state one would expect in this compound , this would depend on the difference in energy between the intra - e@xmath8 crystal - field splitting and the hund s rule coupling strength .",
    "these differences can be derived from the two central panels of fig .",
    "[ bs_326 ] . focusing only on the ni atom ( of which we have two in the structure ) highlighted in fig .",
    "[ bs_326 ] ( the opposite spin would need to be used for the other one ) , if the down - spin d@xmath7 band were lower in energy than the up - spin d@xmath21 , a low - spin state would be expected , and the d@xmath21 up - spin band would be only half - filled leading to a metallic result .",
    "this low - spin state is the solution found in ref . .",
    "however , our calculations yield a high - spin state to be more stable . in this case , as we see in fig .",
    "[ bs_326 ] , the up - spin d@xmath21 is comparable in energy with the down - spin d@xmath7 . however , there is a third energy to consider .",
    "we observe that the d@xmath7 bands come in bonding - antibonding pairs , due to the spatial confinement of the nio@xmath1 bilayers and the large coupling of those orbitals along the c - axis , similar to what happens in la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25 . that bonding - antibonding splitting leads to a gap opening around the fermi level for this high - spin state that is favorable in energy according to our calculations .",
    "this result is consistent with the conductivity measurements performed in the compound .",
    "the fully occupied up - spin d@xmath21 stabilizes an in - plane af ordering , according to our lda+u calculations .",
    "a question remains as to why this system is not observed to have a long - range in - plane af ordering .",
    "we can try to compare the bandwidths of the d@xmath21 band in the case of this compound and also in la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25 , for which we have calculations : the la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 compound has a d@xmath21 bandwidth of about 1.5 ev , whereas la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25 has a bandwidth of only 1 ev .",
    "an increase in 50% in the bandwidth will lead to a significantly different behavior of the af in - plane coupling .",
    "also , in la@xmath1nio@xmath10 , only short - range@xcite af order exists , which suggests that af in - plane ordering caused by d@xmath21 orbitals is a marginal occurrence in this series of compounds .    to quantify the evolution of antiferromagnetism ,",
    "the role of the o p orbitals should be considered .",
    "the fact that in cuprates af is stronger@xcite and survives to larger values of doping could have to do with the o p bands playing a significant role in cuprates , but a lesser one in these layered nickelates . in the case of la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 , the o p bands are closer to the fermi level ( slightly more than 1 ev ) than in la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25 ( around 2 ev below the fermi energy )",
    ". since the in - plane coupling is mediated by o p bands , differences of this kind will have implications in the different magnetic properties observed in both compounds , where electronic structure calculations predict the same magnetic ground state , with a very similar molecular correlated insulating state produced by quantum confinement .",
    "this obvious difference ( the lower position of the fully occupied o p bands compared to the cuprates ) in the electronic structure between these molecular - insulating layered nickelates , both la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 and la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25,@xcite and the superconducting cuprates , where even zhang - rice singlets can occur@xcite due to the position of the o p bands quite close to the fermi level leads us to think that it could be interesting to explore the possibility of doping the oxygen sites with a larger isoelectronic anion like s. these s ions would create an anionic band with a larger bandwidth and situated higher in energy . the af coupling in the plane could be enhanced as a result , and also the participation of the anion @xmath35 bands in the electronic structure of these nickelates , making them more similar to the superconducting cuprates .",
    "another difference lies in the fact that superconducting cuprates have a very strong jahn - teller coupling that produces a large elongation of the oxygen octahedra . in the case of the insulating nickelates with an electronic structure closer to that of the cu@xmath4 superconducting compounds ,",
    "the environment is square planar . a much smaller coupling of the electronic degrees of freedom to the lattice",
    "would be expected in the nickelates as opposed to the case of the cuprates .",
    "one may ask : is it possible to have a pressure - induced metal - insulator transition in both la@xmath10ni@xmath0o@xmath25 and la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 ?",
    "the two energies controlling the spin - state in the ni cations are the intra - e@xmath8 crystal field splitting , which can increase by reducing the @xmath36 and @xmath37 lattice parameters , and the bonding - antibonding splitting caused by the d@xmath7-d@xmath7 strong bonding along the @xmath38-axis , which increases as the @xmath38 parameter gets reduced . in a layered system like this ,",
    "applying pressure will reduce the @xmath38 parameter by a larger amount than the @xmath39 in - plane lattice parameters .",
    "pressure will move both d@xmath21 bands higher in energy , and the antibonding part of the d@xmath7 bands also higher in energy .",
    "it would be a question of how pressure affects the position of both bands that would determine a transition to a metallic low - spin state by applying pressure in this compound . with the experimental lattice parameters , we see from our calculations that the intra - e@xmath8 crystal field splitting between d@xmath7 and d@xmath21 bands",
    "is about 2.8 ev , whereas the bonding - antibonding splitting between the d@xmath7 up - spin bands is only 0.8 ev .",
    "thus , if applying pressure increases the crystal - field splitting by a few tenths of an ev , a spin - state crossover may take place induced by pressure , leading to an energetically favored metallic state .",
    "the structure of la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath13@xcite is also layered , but compared to la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 , all the apical oxygens neighboring ni remain , leading to all ni atoms being in an equivalent octahedral environment .",
    "a simple electron count gives a ni@xmath40 : d@xmath41 state for both ni cations .",
    "experiments on the compound indicate a paramagnetic metal at all temperatures .",
    "however , the formation of local moments and the appearance of dynamic af coupling has been suggested by analyzing the susceptibility data.@xcite other studies confirm the system to be a paramagnetic metal , showing signatures of a low - dimensional localized electron system.@xcite the existence of a charge density wave has been suggested in the past.@xcite    due to its complicated magnetic and electronic structure properties , we have studied two different solutions .",
    "one is a non - magnetic solution with an identical electronic structure in each spin channel ( t@xmath42@xmath43e@xmath8@xmath44 ) , depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ bs_327 ] , with the ni states highlighted . around the fermi level",
    ", the e@xmath8 states can be noticed , with the d@xmath21 band also crossing the fermi level showing a 2 ev bandwidth .",
    "the d@xmath7 has a bonding and an antibonding branch due to the large interplanar coupling between those levels and the quantum confinement of the nio@xmath1 bilayers in the structure .",
    "this splitting leads to the d@xmath7 bonding states to be lower in energy and more occupied than the d@xmath21 bands , which would otherwise be degenerate for the two ni sub - layers .",
    "the bonding - antibonding splitting is slightly over 1 ev , larger than in la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 , showing that a large hopping occurs also through an apical oxygen in the octahedral environment .",
    "the interplanar ni - ni distance is 3.1   in la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 and 3.9   in la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath13 , which might seem contradictory .",
    "it is however difficult to quantify the different effects of u ( the on - site coulomb repulsion introduced in our lda+u calculations ) here due to the different occupation of that e@xmath8 level compared to the case of la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 . in both cases , we present results with the same value of u ( 4.75 ev ) .",
    "the other solution we have studied has a local magnetic moment for each ni cation . this solution is lower in energy than the non - magnetic solution by a large 100 mev / ni when lda+u method is used with u= 4.75 ev . however , in such a metallic system the lda+u description could be overestimating correlation effects , causing the energy difference to be too large .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to study a magnetic solution , considering the experimental evidence for magnetic behavior .",
    "in such a solution , the ni@xmath40 : d@xmath41 cations have a spin value s=3/4 , with the d@xmath7 orbital fully occupied , and the d@xmath21 band half - filled for each spin channel .",
    "this quarter - filling of the in - plane e@xmath8 band would stabilize an in - plane af coupling , if a localized electron picture is sufficiently valid in this itinerant compound .",
    "if correlation effects ( quantified by u in our calculations ) are eliminated from the calculations , the non - magnetic solution becomes more stable .",
    "the experimental evidence suggests correlated metallic behavior , which will require more sophisticated study .",
    "the mott metal - insulator transition in this series of compounds is expected to occur at the ni@xmath4 compound . starting to remove oxygen from the metallic la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath13 , and",
    "using the usual valences for o and la , the transition should take place at la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath16 , with ni@xmath4 : d@xmath18 cations , if these are in a high - spin s= 1 state .",
    "the square - planar environment of the ni cations in the insulating compound la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath45 suggests that on removing oxygen from la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath13 , the first oxygens that can be removed are the apical oxygens in the nio@xmath5 octahedra .",
    "there are four inequivalent oxygens in the structure of la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath13 , the choice of an apical oxygen that leads to a ground state is more stable by several hundreds of mev / ni compared to removing any other oxygen .",
    "those total energies were calculated at u= 0 , with a relaxation of the atomic coordinates done within the gga scheme .",
    "the removal of an apical oxygen leads to two different environments for the ni cations : a nio@xmath5 distorted octahedral environment and a square pyramidal nio@xmath46 environment .",
    "once the choice of oxygens to be removed is clarified by total energy calculations , we have further relaxed the lowest energy state within the lda+u scheme .",
    "additional distortions of the oxygen cages surrounding the ni cations that occur lead to the opening of a gap at the fermi level and the stabilization of a distinct s= 1 state in both the octahedral and the square pyramidal environments after relaxation",
    ".    we can describe the slightly different electronic structures of the two inequivalent ni atoms in the , respectively , square pyramidal and octahedral environments with the aid of the fat bands plots shown in fig .",
    "[ bs_3265 ] .",
    "both cations are in an s=1 state ( t@xmath42@xmath47e@xmath8@xmath19 ) .",
    "the main difference between them is in the position of the d@xmath7 band . in the case of the octahedral environment , it is in the same energy window as the d@xmath21 band , particularly easy to see in the down spin channel on the third panel of fig .",
    "[ bs_3265 ] , the flat band highlighted just below the fermi level . in the case of the square pyramidal environment , the absence of one of the apical oxygens leads the d@xmath7 band lying lower in energy than the d@xmath21 band , due to the higher repulsion with oxygen undergone by the latter .",
    "the bandwidth of the band that transfers the in - plane af coupling observed to be the ground state for this compound is small compared to that of the la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 , being only 0.6 ev .",
    "this small bandwidth could indicate that the in - plane af ordering is even less likely in this borderline compound than in the more insulating ones , where it is also only marginally stable .",
    "again , the o p bands that mediate the coupling are several ev below the fermi level , weakening the superexchange process .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the evolution of the electronic structure in low - valence layered nickelates with varying oxygen content ( hence , ni valence ) .",
    "the system la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 , with @xmath3= 0.0 , 0.5 and 1 , has been studied",
    ". a metal - insulator transition takes place between a molecular insulating state for @xmath3= 1 to a paramagnetic metal and @xmath3= 1 , via a mott - transition compound formed by ni@xmath4 : d@xmath18 cations , with half - filled e@xmath8 bands .",
    "the main difference with layered cuprates lies in the absence of the o p bands close to the fermi level ; in nickelates , only ni d states are close to the fermi level .",
    "one consequence of this is a less strong in - plane af coupling between ni @xmath48 orbitals , and also a different range of existence of the af ordering and the insulating phase with respect to oxygen doping .",
    "the insulating properties of la@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath5 are understood as a process due to quantum confinement of the nio@xmath1 bilayer that leads to a bonding - antibonding splitting between the ni d@xmath7 orbitals .",
    "the resulting gap gives the insulating behavior .",
