    "recent empirical analyses regarding the shape of the comoving spatial section of the universe , assuming a perturbed friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( perturbed - flrw ) model , have mostly focussed on the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) all - sky maps of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the results are presently inconclusive regarding both curvature and topology .",
    "the curvature has been found to be `` nearly ''",
    "zero , i.e. , comoving space could be hyperbolic , flat or spherical .",
    "writing the curvature as an effective density parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the total density parameter , , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the total density and the critical density , respectively .",
    "the latter is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hubble parameter and @xmath8 the gravitational constant . ]",
    "none of the three possible curvatures @xmath9 have been observationally excluded to high statistical significance .",
    "it is true that the precision in upper limits to @xmath10 has improved by about one a half orders of magnitude in the last decade and a half , and that the accuracy in @xmath10 upper limits has similarly improved , but these limits do not exclude any of @xmath9 .",
    "results regarding topology , i.e. the fundamental group @xmath11 of holonomy transformations of the comoving spatial section , are also inconclusive .",
    "several groups have found that the poincar dodecahedral space @xmath12 , with covering space @xmath13 and fundamental group @xmath14 , is preferred over simply connected infinite flat space @xcite in order to fit the wmap data , while others exclude detectable cosmic topology @xcite , or prefer simply connected infinite flat space @xcite .    while a well - established theoretical basis for cosmic curvature exists ( the einstein field equations match the spatial curvature of the universe to its matter - energy density ) , there are at present only hints as to what might constitute a theory of cosmic topology . various quantum gravity aspects of cosmic topology include the decay from pure quantum to mixed states ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , smooth topology evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and work that could contribute to a physical motivation for deciding which 3-manifold should be favoured by a theory of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "a recent heuristic result is that of the dynamical effect of cosmic topology in the presence of density perturbations .",
    "a residual weak - limit gravitational effect in the presence of a density perturbation selects well - proportioned spaces @xcite in general , and the poincar dodecahedral space @xmath12 in particular , to be special in the sense of being `` better balanced '' @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the residual gravity effect and many of the empirical analyses in choosing the same space , the poincar space , suggests that this effect might have been important in the early universe in selecting the comoving 3-manifold in which we live .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite @xcite have recently carried out several studies showing that a _ flat _ compact model ( specifically , @xmath15 ) generally provides a better fit to the wmap data than infinite flat models .",
    "this work provides one of the few ways of potentially showing that the universe is flat in the sense of being a flat 3-manifold ( apart from perturbations ) , if that is indeed the true shape of the universe , rather than a poincar space .",
    "approaches that ignore topology sometimes argue in favour of flatness while simultaneously stating ( correctly ) that they can not determine the curvature .",
    "for example , @xcite calculate the odds `` in favour of a flat universe '' , but also state that `` the [ curvature ] of the universe is not knowable '' if @xmath16 , and make no claim that @xmath17 .",
    "that is , they assert that either the curvature has not yet been determined , or it is unknowable . in contrast , use of the global properties of the comoving spatial section potentially offers a way to determine the curvature , even if the curvature is zero , as suggested by @xcite s work , and even in the ( realistic ) presence of perturbations .",
    "although flat , compact space models have been frequently modelled , they have generally been disliked for fine - tuning reasons , especially in relation to inflationary motivations and scenarios .",
    "it is frequently stated that the probability of the spatial section of the universe , according to the exact - flrw model , being exactly flat is zero .",
    "for example , in a discussion about common misconceptions regarding `` standard universe models '' and inflation , @xcite states that being exactly flat `` requires _",
    "infinite _ fine tuning of initial conditions ; if say the two millionth digit in the value of @xmath18 is non - zero at any time , then the universe is not spatially flat '' and that `` although the scale - free @xmath19 exponential case is the model underlying the way many people approach the problem , it is highly exceptional  it is of zero measure within the space of all inflationary fl models '' ( sect .",

    "that is , if the measure @xmath20 on the space @xmath0 of all exact - flrw models is a probability measure , i.e. if @xmath21 , then the probability of exact flatness is zero : @xmath22 .",
    "since inflationary scenarios only favour near flatness , not exact flatness , the subclass of inflationary scenarios @xmath23 can validly have @xmath24 , i.e. a positive probability , according to this implicit definition of a measure space @xmath25 .    however , is being exactly flat necessarily a physical possibility that has zero measure ?",
    "@xcite argue that finding a natural , plausible , measure in the `` full space of cosmological space - times '' is an open problem .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have typically only considered the curvature of the spatial section and not the fact that it is a 3-manifold that has both a curvature and a topology .",
    "in other words , the set @xmath0 of exact - flrw models is considered to be equivalent to @xmath26 , i.e. it is parametrised only by the density parameter @xmath1 . the measure is implicitly assumed to be a simple function of the lebesgue measure on @xmath27 that gives @xmath28 and a normalised measure @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that an flrw model has both a curvature and a topology is not a new insight .",
    "both curvature and topology have been mentioned quite clearly by several of the founders of relativistic cosmology @xcite .",
    "the curvature and topology of flrw models have usually been thought to be independent of one another , except that the set of possible 3-manifolds is divided between hyperbolic , flat , and spherical 3-manifolds .",
    "some work that does consider topology includes that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite defined a `` spectral distance '' function over pairs of universes with ( in general ) different spatial sections , but did not try extending this to a measure .",
    "@xcite applied a hartle - hawking `` no boundary '' path integral approach to the spatial section that constitutes a boundary to a global space - time .",
    "alternatively , a bayesian approach to measure spaces and the flatness problem , using jaynes principle , finds that the flatness problem is not a problem @xcite .    here , a more elementary approach to obtaining a measure on the set of exact - flrw models , considering both the curvature and topology of the models , is presented . in [ s - hypothesis ] , a physically motivated hypothesis is proposed .",
    "this hypothesis is used to determine the set of compact , 3-spatial sections of exact - flrw models where the density parameter @xmath1 is a _ derived _ rather than fundamental physical parameter .",
    "only compact models are considered , with the motivation that this is physically more reasonable than infinite models .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "the implicit assumption that the space of exact - flrw models consists of @xmath31 is a statement that @xmath1 is a free parameter , unconstrained by prior physics .",
    "one way of introducing some physical motivation for a theory of a set of possible universes is to extrapolate from known physics .",
    "local geometry is a fundamental and experimentally well - established part of modern physics , via the einstein field equations",
    ". it would be physically reasonable that as a result of quantum gravity processes or during ( mostly ) smooth early - universe topology evolution as explored by @xcite , some global physical properties of the universe in the flrw approximation ( not necessarily the density @xmath1 ) could be determined by a global geometrical property .",
    "the most obvious global geometrical property is _ geometria situs _",
    "@xcite , known today as topology . for exact - flrw models ,",
    "the topological characteristic that is usually discussed is equivalent to the choice of constant curvature 3-manifold .",
    "what property or properties could most reasonably be hypothesised to be determined by the choice of topology ?",
    "although density ( in an exact - flrw model ) can be evaluated globally , a more fundamental property in a classical , pre - relativistic sense , is mass . in pre - relativistic physics , conservation of mass in any closed system",
    "is a fundamental principle . in flrw",
    "cosmological models , let us define the global ( by volume ) , total ( by component ) non - relativistic plus relativistic mass - energy in the 3-spatial section as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total ( by component ) mass - energy density , and @xmath34 is the volume of the spatial section in physical units , if @xmath19 , and as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the curvature radius in physical units and @xmath37 is the volume of the spatial section in units of @xmath38 , if @xmath39 . since , in general , @xmath40 is not conserved with time , due to the change in frequency of ( in particular ) photons with respect to locally comoving observers , this should be evaluated at a given epoch .",
    "another parameter that could reasonably depend on the choice of 3-manifold is the hubble parameter @xmath7 .",

    "how does the topology of spatial sections invalidate this argument ?",
    "the reason is that while topology in some sense might appear to give `` additional '' parameter freedom to the flrw models , curvature can be thought of as a type of rigidity that together with topology reduces a continuous interval in the possible range of @xmath1 to a set of discrete points .",

    "it is this physical relation between @xmath1 being both local and global , which is a result of the rigidity of ( constant curvature ) curved 3-manifolds , that reduces the apparent continuum of values of @xmath1 in the curved case to a discrete set .",
    "the set of values of @xmath1 in the flat case is already discrete , since it contains just one member , @xmath129 .",

    "moreover , while hypothesis  [ hyp - m - h - dependonm ] reduces the freedom of @xmath1 in curved flrw models , it implies _ more _ parameter freedom in flat flrw models for other parameters .    in the 3-torus model @xmath15 , there are ( at least ) three parameters required to define the fundamental domain .",

    "let us set @xmath157 to be the smallest @xmath102-algebra that contains all open sets on @xmath158 induced by the usual topology on @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the lebesgue measure , is a measure space over @xmath139 , twice the injectivity radius of exact - flrw models of the universe .",
    "let us normalise this by defining @xmath161 where @xmath162 is given by ( [ e - defn - eta ] ) , yielding the probability space @xmath163 .    hence , under the obvious probability space over the size of the 3-spatial section of flrw models , the probability of a flat flrw model is unity and the probability of a curved flrw model is zero : @xmath164 this follows from ( [ e - frinj - set ] ) and ( [ e - normalise - lambda ] ) , since the lebesgue measure on an interval on the real line is the length of that interval , and the lebesgue measure on a set of discrete , isolated points is zero .",
    "an event that occurs with a probability of one is referred to as being _ almost sure _ ( a.s . ) in the kolmogorov construction of probability spaces .",
    "this should not be confused with certainty .",
    "for example , an event of a uniform random process that selects a value from the interval @xmath165 on the real line results in a specific value @xmath166 , despite the fact that the process a.s.[multiblock footnote omitted ]  does not choose that specific value @xmath166 .",
    "thus , an a.s .",
    "outcome is not certain , even though its probability is one . in the case of interest here , if the lebesgue measure is adopted and normalised , then a flat model a.s .  occurs and a non - flat model a.s .",
    "does not occur .",
    "the probability space over @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath107 , follows from the link between local and global definitions of the density parameter , i.e. between curvature and topology , implied by hypothesis  [ hyp - m - h - dependonm ] .",
    "this relation can be described in terms of the curvature radius @xmath36 , as shown above .",
    "thus , equality of the local and global definitions of @xmath1 discretises it . in the flat case ,",
    "the curvature is zero and @xmath36 is undefined .",
    "the mathematical nature of flat , constant curvature 3-manifolds allows them a continuous range of fundamental domain shapes .",
    "the physical processes that are presumed to select a 3-manifold from among those mathematically available are not constrained to choose fundamental domain size parameters from a discrete set . unless a physical constraint is added , a continuous , finite range in @xmath139 , the size parameter adopted here , is allowed .",
    "on the other hand , constant - curvature , curved 3-manifolds do not allow @xmath137 to vary . the same rigidity that suggests the discrete measure in @xmath107 leads even further , to the lebesgue measure in @xmath163 .",
    "another way of saying this is that hypothesis  [ hyp - m - h - dependonm ] not only links together the curvature and topology of exact - flrw models , so that the rigidity of curved 3-manifolds constrains them to a discrete parameter space , but it also frees up flat 3-manifolds to occupy a continuous parameter space , if the parameter chosen is , for example , the injectivity radius .",
    "this is why , given hypothesis  [ hyp - m - h - dependonm ] , the natural choice of measure leads to a probability space where a flat model a.s .",
    "occurs ( @xmath167 ) and a non - flat model a.s",
    ".  does not occur ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "cosmic topology has been referred to in the cosmological context in the pre - relativistic era @xcite and by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite during the founding of relativistic cosmology . when the topology of the flrw models is taken into account , the popular idea that @xmath129 flrw models constitute a class of measure zero among the full set of exact - flrw models",
    "is no longer self - evident .",
    "this has been shown here by proposing that the parameters determined at a given epoch @xmath42 following topology evolution , i.e. as the results of the processes of primordial spatial 3-manifold evolution ( quantum or otherwise ) , are the global ( by volume ) , total ( by component ) mass - energy @xmath169 and the hubble parameter @xmath170 , i.e. these are functions of the 3-manifold @xmath41 selected by those processes , while the density @xmath1 is relegated to a derived parameter ( hypothesis  [ hyp - m - h - dependonm ] ) .",
    "this hypothesis leads to quite different measure spaces and associated probability spaces than those in which @xmath129 flrw models constitute a class of measure zero .",
    "when @xmath1 is used to parametrise the flrw models , the hypothesis leads to the discrete measure as the obvious choice . in this case",
    ", there is no obvious constraint requiring @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , use of the injectivity radius @xmath2 to parametrise flrw models , rather than @xmath1 , suggests the lebesgue measure as the natural measure . in this case , the measure of the class of _ non - flat _ models is zero .",
    "since the measure is normalisable , the probability of a flat flrw model in the corresponding probability space is unity .",
    "hence , in this case , a flat model occurs a.s .  and a non - flat model a.s .",
    "does not occur , in the kolmogorov probability sense of these terms .",
    "this is the reverse of what has been thought to be the case when topology is ignored .",
    "how does this happen ?",
    "for exact - flrw models with compact spatial sections , the density parameter has both a local and a global physical meaning .",
    "the requirement of equality between the two definitions of the density parameter , and the rigidity of curved , constant - curvature 3-manifolds , reduce the parameter freedom of the non - flat models .",
    "in contrast , the lack of rigidity of the flat models allows them a continuum of possible sizes .",
    "hence , the flat models become much more probable .",
    "this approach suggests a motivation independent of inflationary scenarios for the recent work finding that a @xmath140 flrw model provides a good fit to the wmap sky maps @xcite .",
    "moreover , a physical relation between the curvature and topology of comoving space is implied .",
