    "dimension theory_. basically , an equivalence relation @xmath4 is given on a structure @xmath3 , and our goal is to elucidate the quotient structure @xmath42 .",
    "we shall be interested in cases where @xmath3 is a _ complete lattice _ endowed with a notion of orthogonality subject to a number of axioms . to make it clear that the motivations for this are widespread and by no means confined to lattice theory , we start by discussing what is known about some fundamental examples . in chapter  [ ch : clesp ] , we will apply our general theory to these examples , thus showing the improvements that it brings to them .",
    "one of the most basic examples of what could be called a `` dimension theory '' arises from measure theory . to pick a favorite",
    ", we first consider the lebesgue measure @xmath43 on the real line @xmath44 .",
    "it is defined on the boolean algebra @xmath45 of all lebesgue - measurable subsets of @xmath44 .",
    "however , it fails total additivity of measure , for every subset of @xmath44 is the union of singletons , which have lebesgue measure zero . to bring back total additivity ,",
    "the standard way is to say that @xmath43 is defined not on @xmath45 , but on the quotient algebra @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the ideal of null sets .",
    "the boolean algebra @xmath14 and the resulting map from @xmath14 to @xmath48 $ ] , which we still denote by @xmath43 , have the following properties :    * @xmath14 is a _",
    "complete _ boolean algebra . *",
    "the map @xmath43 is _ unrestrictedly additive _ , that is , the following equality holds : @xmath49 for any _ disjoint _ family @xmath50 of elements of @xmath14 .",
    "the notation @xmath51 stands for the _ join _",
    "( i.e. , supremum ) of the set @xmath52 in @xmath14 .",
    "* for all @xmath5 , @xmath15 , if @xmath6 is a translate of @xmath5 ( that is , @xmath53 for some real number @xmath54 ) , then @xmath55 .",
    "rule ( b ) above seems somehow puzzling at first glance , because of the apparent possibility of an uncountable index set @xmath56 .",
    "however , since the boolean algebra @xmath14 is countably saturated , all infinite joins in @xmath14 are , really , _",
    "countable _ joins , so that , in  ( b ) , all the @xmath57-s are majorized by the join of countably many of them .    for @xmath5 , @xmath15",
    ", we define the relation @xmath25 to hold , if there are disjoint families @xmath50 and @xmath58 of elements of @xmath14 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a translate of @xmath57 , for all @xmath62 .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that @xmath4 is an _ equivalence relation _ on @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , by ( b ) and ( c ) above , @xmath25 implies that @xmath55 , for all @xmath5 , @xmath15 .",
    "it is harder to verify that the converse of the above fact also holds , namely : @xmath55 implies that @xmath25 , for all @xmath5 , @xmath15 .",
    "this fact is due to s. banach and a. tarski , see @xcite , or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  9.17 ) .",
    "hence the quotient set @xmath63 is isomorphic , _ via _ the measure  @xmath43 , to the interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "a moment s reflection shows that @xmath63 can be endowed with a _ partial addition _ , defined by the rule @xmath64+[y]=[x\\vee y],\\quad\\text{for all disjoint } x,\\,y\\in b,\\ ] ] that endows it with a structure of _ partial commutative monoid _ ( see definition  [ d : partcm ] ) , and that the measure @xmath43 factors through an isomorphism of partial monoids between @xmath63 and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "we see in this particular case that @xmath63 is a _ total _ monoid , that is , the addition of @xmath63 is defined everywhere .",
    "now let us consider the _ converse _ of the above paragraph . that is , we are given a boolean algebra @xmath14 , endowed with an equivalence relation @xmath4 , and we wish to find the structure of @xmath63 . while this problem in full generality can lead to almost any structure ,",
    "we focus the study by making the following assumptions on @xmath14 and @xmath4 , that are satisfied for the example above :    * @xmath14 is a complete boolean algebra .",
    "* @xmath65 implies that @xmath66 , for all @xmath67 . *",
    "( see axiom  ( l6 ) of definition  [ d : measchlatt ] ) the relation @xmath4 is _ unrestrictedly refining _ , that is , for every @xmath68 and every disjoint family @xmath69 of elements of  @xmath3 , if @xmath70 , then there exists a decomposition @xmath71 , with @xmath72 disjoint , such that @xmath73 for all @xmath62 . *",
    "( see axiom  ( l7 ) of definition  [ d : measchlatt ] ) the relation @xmath4 is _ unrestrictedly additive _",
    ", that is , for all disjoint families @xmath72 and @xmath69 of elements of  @xmath3 , if @xmath73 for all @xmath62 , then @xmath74 .",
    "the most basic example of this situation is for @xmath75 , the powerset algebra of an infinite set @xmath76 , where @xmath4 is the relation of _ equipotency _ on subsets of @xmath76 , that is , @xmath77 if and only if  there exists a bijection from @xmath78 onto @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath40 is the unique ordinal such that @xmath80 , then @xmath42 is isomorphic to the monoid @xmath81 endowed with the addition that extends the natural addition of the set @xmath82 of nonnegative integers and such that @xmath83 , for all @xmath84 and all ordinals @xmath54 , @xmath85 such that @xmath86 , see page  .",
    "so , if @xmath87 is the map defined by the rule @xmath88 , for all @xmath89 , then @xmath90 factors through @xmath4 , thus defining an isomorphism from @xmath63 onto @xmath91 .",
    "as we shall see in this paper , it is still possible , in the general case , to obtain a `` measure '' @xmath90 on @xmath14 such that @xmath63 is isomorphic to the range of @xmath90 .",
    "the range of the measure @xmath90 is not necessarily @xmath48 $ ] and not even some @xmath91 ( as in the example above ) , but rather a certain set of continuous functions from a complete boolean space ( i.e. , extremally disconnected compact hausdorff topological space ) @xmath76 to a monoid of the form @xmath92 ( or a submonoid of this monoid ) .",
    "a similar result is achieved by d.  maharam in  @xcite , in a slightly different context  for instance , all sums and joins are countable joins , while  @xmath14 satisfies the countable chain condition .",
    "this is not the only restriction imposed in maharam s work , as , for example , axiom  iii , page  281 in @xcite , that rules out what we will call later the `` type  iii '' case .",
    "let @xmath17 be a ( von  neumann ) regular , right self - injective ring , let @xmath93 be a nonsingular injective right @xmath17-module .",
    "we order the set @xmath3 of all direct summands of @xmath93 by inclusion and we endow it with the relation of isomorphism , @xmath94 .",
    "the _ dimension theory _ of @xmath93 is the study of the structure of @xmath95 .",
    "we say that a family @xmath96 of elements of @xmath3 is _ orthogonal _ , if the sum of the submodules @xmath97 is a direct sum .",
    "we recall some fundamental properties of @xmath3 and @xmath94 ( references will be given in section  [ s : rsireg ] ) :    * @xmath3 is a complete lattice , that is , every subset of @xmath3 has a supremum .",
    "+ it is known that the infimum of a family @xmath96 of elements of @xmath3 is their _ intersection _ , @xmath98 .",

    ", the structure of @xmath95 has been completely elucidated in several particular cases .",
    "for example , in case @xmath93 is _ directly finite _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath93 is not isomorphic to any proper direct summand of itself ) , @xmath95 is isomorphic to a lower subinterval ( with respect to the componentwise ordering ) of a monoid of the form @xmath114 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are complete boolean spaces ; see chapter  11 in k.r .",
    "goodearl and a.k .",
    "boyle @xcite . in the general case",
    ", there are a monoid  @xmath93 of the form given by and a direct power  @xmath115 of a monoid of the form @xmath116 ( for a certain ordinal @xmath40 ) such that @xmath95 embeds into @xmath117 , see chapters 12 and  13 in  @xcite , and the variations in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 12 ) .",
    "further results along these lines were obtained by c.  busqu @xcite , who showed , in particular , that the second factor of the embedding above , namely the map @xmath118 , actually sends @xmath95 to @xmath119 for a suitable complete boolean space @xmath76 ( containing @xmath120 ) ( * ? ? ? * proposition  4.7 ) . however",
    ", these embeddings do not provide an isomorphism of @xmath95 onto a _",
    "lower subset _ of a monoid of continuous functions .",
    "the difficulties are already visible in case @xmath17 is a complete boolean algebra ( viewed as a ring ) , due to an example of k.  eda @xcite : there exists a complete boolean algebra @xmath17 such that the injective hull of the free @xmath17-module of rank @xmath121 contains a direct sum of @xmath122 copies of itself ( see the discussion of problem 18 in @xcite ) . here",
    "the image of the embedding obtained from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite contains a function with all values at least @xmath123 , but not the constant function with value @xmath122 .      for elements @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 in a lattice @xmath3 with zero ,",
    "we say that @xmath127 , if @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we say that @xmath3 is _ sectionally complemented _",
    ", if for all @xmath124 , @xmath130 such that @xmath131 , there exists @xmath132 such that @xmath133 .",
    "if @xmath3 is _ modular _ , that is , the implication @xmath134 holds , for all @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , then the partial operation @xmath135 gives  @xmath3 a structure of _ partial commutative monoid_. completeness and meet - continuity of  @xmath3 are defined as in ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of subsection  [ su : rsireg ] .",
    "so , in particular , if @xmath93 is a nonsingular injective right module over a right self - injective regular ring @xmath17 , then the lattice of all direct summands of @xmath93 is complete , meet - continuous , sectionally complemented , and modular .",
    "the classical von  neumann _ continuous geometries _",
    ", see j. von  neumann @xcite or f. maeda @xcite , are obtained by adding the conditions that @xmath3 has a unit ( that is , a largest element ) and is join - continuous .    at this point , we seem to be stymied because of the following problem .",
    "we can not claim outright that our lattice - theoretical context could lead to generalizations of subsection  [ su : rsireg ] , for there is no such thing _ a priori _ as `` isomorphism of submodules '' between the elements of @xmath3 . in the case of continuous geometries",
    ", it is easy to remedy this by replacing isomorphism by _ perspectivity _ , which turns out to be _ transitive _",
    "( this is a difficult result , due to j. von  neumann  @xcite ) .",
    "elements @xmath124 and @xmath125 of a lattice  @xmath3 are _ perspective _ , in notation @xmath136 , if there exists @xmath132 such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 . for continuous geometries ,",
    "the structure of @xmath42 is completely understood , see @xcite and , for the general , reducible case , t.  iwamura @xcite  namely , @xmath42 is isomorphic to a lower segment of the positive cone of a dedekind complete lattice - ordered group .",
    "the paper j.  harding and m.f .",
    "janowitz  @xcite shows how a reducible continuous geometry can be represented as the space of continuous sections of a bundle of irreducible continuous geometries , thus shedding more light on the transition from irreducible continuous geometries to reducible ones .",
    "however , for a general complete , meet - continuous , sectionally complemented , modular lattice @xmath3 , the relation of perspectivity @xmath4 on @xmath3 is not transitive as a rule ",
    "see , for example , the obvious case where @xmath3 is the subspace lattice of an infinite - dimensional vector space over a field .",
    "hence , we have to find a better candidate than @xmath4 to replace isomorphism of submodules .",
    "a natural guess is of course the _ transitive closure _",
    "@xmath139 of @xmath4 ( usually called _ projectivity _ ) , but this relation fails to be additive , as defined in axiom  ( l7 ) of definition  [ d : measchlatt ] , and as isomorphism of submodules should be .",
    "the final answer is , in fact , nontrivial , and it follows from the theory of _ normal equivalences _ introduced by the second author in chapters 1013 of @xcite .",
    "namely , there is ( fortunately ! ) _ exactly one _ `` reasonable '' candidate for isomorphism , and it is the binary relation @xmath140 on @xmath3 defined by the rule @xmath141 for all @xmath124 , @xmath130 .",
    "the transitivity of @xmath140 is proved in theorem  13.2 of @xcite , while the complete additivity of @xmath140 ( axiom  ( l7 ) of definition  [ d : measchlatt ] , see also item  ( 6 ) of subsection  [ su : rsireg ] ) is proved as in proposition  13.9 of @xcite by replacing countable families by arbitrary families .",
    "the quotient @xmath142 is then a lower subset of the so - called _ dimension monoid _",
    "@xmath143 of @xmath3 , which , as its name indicates , is a ( commutative ) monoid .",
    "the dimension theory of @xmath3 is elucidated here in theorem  [ t : dimmonrcmlatt ] . in the context of subsection  [ su : rsireg ] ,",
    "that is , @xmath3 is the lattice of all direct summands of a given nonsingular injective right module over a right self - injective regular ring , it is then the case that @xmath140 is identical to submodule isomorphism on @xmath3 , see lemma  10.2 and theorem  13.2 of @xcite .    of crucial importance for all the proofs of these results",
    "is a result of i. halperin and j.  von  neumann @xcite that states that @xmath144 and @xmath16 implies that @xmath25 , for all @xmath5 , @xmath24 .",
    "this result is extended in @xcite to countably meet - continuous lattices , where it is used to prove that the quotient @xmath142 is then a so - called _ generalized cardinal algebra _ , see proposition  13.10 of @xcite .",
    "however , even in case the lattice - theoretical version of direct finiteness ( see subsection  [ su : rsireg ] ) holds in @xmath3 , no analogue of an embedding into monoids of the form had been found before the present work .",
    "we recall that an _ aw*-algebra _ is a c*-algebra @xmath18 such that the right annihilator of any subset @xmath78 of @xmath18 has the form @xmath145 , for a projection @xmath26 of @xmath18 ( a _ projection _ of @xmath18 is an element @xmath26 of  @xmath18 such that @xmath146 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the set of projections of @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath131 hold , if @xmath147 ( equivalently , @xmath148 ) , for all @xmath124 , @xmath130 .",
    "thus @xmath149 is a partial ordering on @xmath3 .",
    "orthogonality of any projections @xmath124 and @xmath125 , in notation @xmath150 , is defined by @xmath151 , and ( murray - von  neumann ) equivalence is defined by the rule @xmath152 much of the structure of @xmath3 was developed axiomatically by i. kaplansky in his monograph @xcite .",
    "some of the axioms and methods we use were inspired by kaplansky s work , as was the structure theory for nonsingular injective modules constructed by goodearl and boyle @xcite .",
    "readers familiar with either of those works will recognize the parallels below .",
    "again , the quotient @xmath42 can be endowed with a structure of partial commutative monoid , where addition is given by the rule @xmath153+[b]=[a+b],\\quad\\text{if } ab=0,\\text { for all } a,\\,b\\in l,\\ ] ] where @xmath154 $ ] denotes the @xmath4-equivalence class of a projection @xmath26 of @xmath18 .",
    "the amount of known general information on the structure of @xmath42 is more fragmentary than for the examples considered in previous sections , due to fewer axioms satisfied .",
    "for example , the analogues of properties ( 3 ) ( meet - continuity ) and ( 4 ) ( modularity ) considered in subsection  [ su : rsireg ] fail for projections of aw*-algebras as a rule . in f.j .",
    "murray and j. von  neumann @xcite , a @xmath48$]-valued `` dimension function '' is constructed on the projections of any _ w*-factor _",
    "( i.e. , indecomposable von neumann algebra ) ; kaplansky showed that the same construction could be carried out for aw*-factors .",
    "still in the indecomposable case , it is known that the closed two - sided ideals are well - ordered , see f.b .",
    "wright @xcite .",
    "most of what was known about @xmath42 in the general case could be obtained from more general , often lattice - theoretical works that we shall discuss now .",
    "a common feature of the structures considered in subsections [ su : ameasth][su : projaw * ] is that they all involve a complete , sectionally complemented lattice @xmath3 , a binary relation @xmath2 on @xmath3 , and an equivalence relation @xmath4 on @xmath3 .",
    "it has been observed early that even apart from the classical study of continuous geometries , the dimension theory of a given structure could be done by just studying the associated structure @xmath155 .",
    "furthermore , these structures will be _ ordered _ structures , so that we shall write @xmath35 instead of @xmath155 :    * it is in s. maeda @xcite that the most general axiomatization of the structures @xmath35 is given .",
    "it holds for all the examples considered in subsections [ su : ameasth][su : projaw * ] , and this allows to construct `` dimension functions''corresponding to the measures of subsection  [ su : ameasth]on @xmath3 that , in the `` finite '' case , separate the elements of @xmath3 . * in l.h .",
    "loomis @xcite , another axiomatization is used , that involves an _ orthocomplementation _ on @xmath3 , thus it does not apply to the examples considered in subsections  [ su : rsireg ] and [ su : cmsmlatt ] . * in p.a .",
    "fillmore @xcite , a further axiomatization of the structures @xmath156 is introduced , that does not assume completeness of @xmath3 but rather _ countable _ completeness , and that assumes an orthocomplementation ( thus , again , it does not encompass subsections  [ su : rsireg ] and [ su : cmsmlatt ] ) .",
    "one of the main results is that the structure @xmath42 is a generalized cardinal algebra ( as in subsection  [ su : cmsmlatt ] ) .",
    "furthermore , under some countability assumptions , @xmath3 is complete and @xmath42 is isomorphic to a lower subset of a monoid of the form , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.12 ) .    nevertheless , in each class of examples considered in subsections [ su : ameasth][su : projaw * ] , some of the dimension - theoretical properties that one could have expected to hold were still missing from the known results .",
    "for example , there has been no general treatment of the reducible type  iii case ; it was seemingly not even clear whether or not it had to be treated as a pathology .      in view of the various examples presented in section  [",
    "s : backgr ] and of what is known about them , the main goals of this paper are the following :    * to capture in a convenient set of axioms the various properties of the structures @xmath0 encountered in these examples .",
    "this set of axioms should be sufficient to develop a _",
    "complete _ dimension theory of these structures , that is , a complete description of the structures @xmath42 , without additional assumptions such as finiteness or chain conditions .",
    "* to develop a set of monoid - theoretical axioms that should be satisfied by the structures @xmath42 .",
    "* although the set of axioms obtained in ( 2 ) is quite complicated , our third goal will be to give a simple description of the structures satisfying the axioms of ( 2 ) in terms of continuous functions on complete boolean spaces .",
    "we shall now give some details about our road to these goals .",
    "the relevant structures @xmath35 will be called _ espaliers _ , see definition  [ d : measchlatt ] . the axiom system",
    "defining espaliers is stronger than the axiom system @xmath157 , @xmath158 ,  ,",
    "@xmath159 , @xmath160 ,  , @xmath161 considered by s.  maeda in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these axioms are sufficient for our purposes  for instance , all the examples considered in section  [ s : backgr ] are espaliers .",
    "the only drastic generalization that we will introduce is to state that the underlying partial ordering of an espalier @xmath35 defines a _ partial _ , as opposed to total , lattice , so that for elements @xmath124 and @xmath125 of @xmath3 , the meet ( i.e. , infimum ) @xmath162 of @xmath163 always exists , but the join ( i.e. , supremum ) of @xmath163 exists only in case @xmath163 is majorized .",
    "this small generalization affects neither the proofs nor even the results  the structures @xmath42 are partial structures anyway  and it paves the way for further algebraic constructions on espaliers , such as _",
    "amalgamation_.      in parallel to this , we shall develop a system of monoid - theoretical axioms , ( m1)(m6 ) ( see definition  [ d : dimint ] ) , that captures the structures ( partial commutative monoids ) @xmath42 , for an espalier @xmath3 .",
    "this axiom system is rather complicated , but it completely isolates what monoid theory we need to understand the structures @xmath42 . among these axioms is a variant of _ conditional completeness _",
    "( see axiom  ( m2 ) ) , that is , every nonempty subset admits an infimum for the algebraic ( pre)ordering ( see definition  [ d : algpr ] ) , but there are other , less natural - looking axioms , such as ( m6 ) .",
    "the partial commutative monoids satisfying axioms ( m1)(m6 ) will be called _ continuous dimension scales_. they are unrelated to h. lin s `` continuous scales '' introduced in @xcite .",
    "the relation between espaliers and continuous dimension scales is then given by the following ( see theorem  [ t : dimesp ] ) .",
    "theorem a let @xmath35 be an espalier .",
    "then the partial commutative monoid  @xmath42 of all @xmath4-equivalence classes of elements of @xmath3 is a continuous dimension scale .      at first glance ,",
    "theorem  a may appear as the ultimate goal of this paper . however , it provides only a list of properties of the partial monoids @xmath42 , without giving any representation in terms of known structures . moreover , although the axioms describing the structure of espalier seem to be almost the weakest possible to obtain a complete dimension theory , and thus , in some sense , unavoidable , this might not seem to be the case _ a priori _ for the axioms describing continuous dimension scales .",
    "we counter this by proving that there are no `` missing '' axioms for continuous dimension scales relative to espaliers .",
    "theorem b a partial commutative monoid @xmath13 is a continuous dimension scale if and only if @xmath164 for some espalier @xmath35 .",
    "theorem  b follows from the fact that most of our classes of examples of espaliers are _ universal _ in the sense that arbitrary continuous dimension scales can be represented ( isomorphically ) as lower subsets of the continuous dimension scales @xmath42 arising from these examples  see , for example , theorems [ t : measduniv ] , [ t : meetcontinduniv ] , [ t : l(r)duniv ] , [ t : l(a)duniv ] .    as for a concrete representation of continuous dimension scales ,",
    "we exhibit them as lower subsets ( for the algebraic preordering ) of product spaces of the form @xmath165 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are complete boolean spaces and , for any ordinal @xmath40 , the monoids @xmath91 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 are defined as @xmath41 endowed with the natural addition and ordering , together with the interval topology ( see section  [ s : notterm ] ) .",
    "see page   for more details .",
    "theorem c let @xmath13 be a partial commutative monoid .",
    "then @xmath13 is a continuous dimension scale if and only if  it can be embedded as a lower subset into a product monoid of the form @xmath165 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are complete boolean spaces .",
    "a more precise version of theorem  c is formulated in theorem  [ t : embdimint ] .",
