    "the number of sources detected is maximized by observing a given field only long enough to become background limited , and to reduce repositioning overheads to 1/3 of the observing time . for uniform density sources observable to cosmological ( non - euclidean ) volumes , the advantage of short exposures is greater .",

    "a major scientific driver for the irac shallow survey is the detection of galaxy clusters at @xmath10 via the redshifted @xmath11 m peak in galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . extending the evolution observed in the @xmath12-band in clusters to @xmath13 ( de  propris et  al .",

    "much of the signal for photometric redshifts , which increase the contrast of such clusters , derives from the 4000  break or from the balmer decrement .",
    "hence deep complementary optical imaging is needed , and near - ir imaging is also helpful . the noao deep wide - field survey ( hereafter ndwfs ; jannuzi & dey 1999 ) meets this need with imaging in @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the @xmath19 ndwfs botes region in particular has both high galactic and high ecliptic latitude , providing low backgrounds for _ spitzer _ imaging .",
    "the field center is near @xmath20 ( j2000 ) .",

    "the shallow survey team plans to address many other astrophysical objectives using these datasets , ranging from identifications and size estimates for high ecliptic latitude asteroids from @xmath21 m thermal emission , to foreground subtraction for detection of fluctuations in the @xmath22 m cosmic background due to ly@xmath23 from population  iii objects at @xmath24 ( cooray et  al .",
    "to achieve reasonable reliability , the survey design follows clyde tombaugh s admonition to obtain at least three observations at each location .",
    "this results in a total of 17,076 separate @xmath25 images in the four irac bands .",
    "the 30s frame time used provides background - limited or nearly background - limited data in all four irac channels , and dominates the @xmath26s needed to reposition by one irac field .",
    "the 45 astronomical observation requests ( aor s ) making up the shallow survey were executed during the 3rd irac campaign , on ut 2004 jan 10 @xmath27 14 .",
    "the survey area was split into 15 `` groups '' , each of which was observed three times with at least 2 hours between observations to ensure that asteroids could be reliably identified .",
    "the observation strategy incorporates several elements to facilitate self - calibration of the data ( fixsen , moseley , & arendt 2000 ) : ( i ) _ dithering _ : each aors starts at a different point in the small - scale cycling dither table ; ( ii ) _ offsets _ : relative to the first aor of each group , subsequent aor revisits to a group are shifted by 1/3rd of the 290  step size used by our mapping ; and ( iii ) _ cadencing _ : for large groups which are rectangular grids , revisits cover the same area with a different step size .",
    "for example , the first aor of the first group uses an @xmath28 grid map , while the revisits use a @xmath29 and a @xmath30 grid map .",

    "sky \" value of the images .",
    "a remaining  jailbar \" pattern in the images ( which was worst for @xmath31 m ) was removed by adding a small constant to the image from each amplifier so that a detector s four output amplifiers have equal median  sky \" values .",
    "a correction for some of the known irac array artifacts associated with bright stars ( mux - bleed and column pulldown ) was applied .",
    "additional processing was needed for the @xmath31 m data because these frames suffered obvious heightened systematic effects .",
    "a secondary median - combined delta - dark frame was generated and applied for the first @xmath31 m image taken in each aor .",
    "finally an additive offset was applied to normalize the sky values in each individual @xmath31 m image to the median of all @xmath31 m images .",
    "this step removed any information at @xmath31 m about structure larger than one irac field , but was needed to remove systematic trends within and between aors .",
