    "the egret era fades away while the large area telescope onboard glast is in its final stages of hardware integration .",
    "many unidentified gamma - ray sources are still unidentified , especially at low galactic latitudes , where , for instance , not a single supernova remnant could be unambigously detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stacking techniques are then a powerful tool to explore , in conjunction with spatial cross - localization of sources followed up by monte carlo analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , if populations as a whole arise in the data .",
    "the difficulty being , of course , the correct handling of the background gamma - ray emission , which represent a more difficult problematic the higher it is .",
    "this contribution focuses on this very point : devising the first ideas for a method of stacking at low galactic latitudes which not only may allow studying already obtained data ( i.e. , egret ) , but also be applied to the forthcoming observations .    in the section below",
    "we describe the general ideas of the stacking technique performed . in section 3",
    "we comment on the application of this technique to source population studies in the galactic plane ( gp ) , specifically in the study of pulsars .",
    "our results are given in section 4 .",
    "to verify the implication of them , we performed simulations , described in section 5 .",
    "finally , a short discussion is given in section 6 .",
    "the general stacking method we have applied follows that outlined of reference @xcite . in order to perform the stacking technique and look for a possible collective detection of gamma - ray emission above 100 mev near the gp",
    ", we have extracted rectangular sky maps with the selected target objects located at the center . we have used egret data from april 1991 through september 1995 matching the baseline of the third egret catalog @xcite , in galactic coordinates .",
    "the extracted maps for each particular target were chosen to be @xmath0 in size , in order to have large fields of views and be consistent with the egret point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we have transformed the coordinates of each map into pseudo - coordinates , with the target object at the center . after doing this , the maps were co - added , producing the stacking .",
    "it was also necessary to extract a diffuse background map for each target object .",
    "for this purpose , we have used the diffuse model that is standard in egret analysis @xcite . in order to take into account the existence of identified egret sources @xcite",
    ", idealized sources with the appropriate fluxes distributed following egret s psf as well as the modulated artifacts were added to the diffuse background . on the other hand ,",
    "the unidentified egret sources were not added to the background in this study .",
    "it was necessary to normalize each one of the extracted diffuse maps ( @xmath1 ) for the different exposures ( @xmath2 ) of the target objects .",
    "the extracted diffuse map for each target object was also transformed into pseudo - coordinates .",
    "finally the diffuse maps for the co - added data were obtained as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the counts diffuse maps ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 . to analyze egret data we used the standard likelihood technique based upon gamma ray counts maps that were binned in measured gamma - ray energy and spatially in rectangular projection in galactic or celestial coordinates @xcite .",
    "the likelihood function of the egret data is the probability of the observed egret data for a specific model of high energy gamma - ray emission , and could be written as the product of the probability for each pixel : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the poisson probability of observing @xmath9 counts in pixel @xmath10 when the number of counts predicted by the model is @xmath11 .",
    "the logarithm of the likelihood is used in hypothesis testing and is usually more easily calculated .",
    "neglecting the last term ( model independent ) the logarithm of the likelihood is given by : @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{logl}\\ ] ] the point - source component of the model consists of an  active `` source ( @xmath13 counts located at ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) ) subject to parameter estimation , and ",
    "inactive '' sources with fixed counts at fixed positions .",
    "thus , the total model prediction for pixel @xmath10 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of counts for the  inactive `` source at ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) ; psf(@xmath20,@xmath21,j ) is the fraction of the psf located at ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) that is in pixel @xmath10 ; @xmath22 is the exposure in pixel @xmath10 ; and @xmath23 ( where ( @xmath24 is the angle between pixels @xmath10 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the parameters of the gamma - ray model are estimated via the maximum likelihood approach .",
    "the sum in equation ( [ logl ] ) is done for pixels within an adjustable analysis radius ( nominally @xmath26 for @xmath27 mev ) . within this circle , the galactic diffuse radiation model ,",
    "is scaled by a multiplier , @xmath28 , which is estimated by maximum likelihood .",
    "also , a maximum likelihood value is used for the level of isotropic diffuse intensity , @xmath29 .",
    "this decouples the likelihood point - source analysis from uncertainties in the large - scale diffuse emision model for analyzing point souces in the given region of interest .",
    "only the shape of the model over the @xmath26 radius circle is used for point - source analysis .",
    "the expected value of @xmath28 is 1 and gbias is 0 if the galactic diffuse model is correct . in order to test the significance of a detection , the model of equation ( [ theta ] ) is used in the likelihood ratio test by testing the null hypothesis , @xmath30 , against the hypothesis that @xmath13 has the estimated value where @xmath28 and @xmath29 have their optimal values for both hypotheses .",
    "this formalism produces a ' ' test statistic  : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are likelihood values with and without a possible source .",
    "@xmath34 is roughly equivalent to the standard deviations .",
    "[ stacking ]",
    "the stacking technique for population studies of gamma - ray sources has been applied for different class of object in several works ( for example : radiogalaxies and seyfert galaxies @xcite , lirgs and ulirgs galaxies @xcite , clusters of galaxies @xcite ) .",
    "all these studies have been so far applied only to high - latitute source populations because of the odds to deal with a dominant and structured diffuse emission . here , however , we directly step into a new methodology to quantify the systematic biases arising from significant diffuse contributions .",
    "we applied this approach in the analysis of egret data to study gamma - ray emission from pulsars for energies above 100 mev .",
    "pulsars represent astrophysical laboratories for extreme conditions .",
    "their properties such as densities , temperatures , velocities , electric potentials , and magnetic fields associated with these spinning neutron stars give rise to high - energy emission through a variety of mechanisms . before the launch of cgro in 1991 only crab pulsar ( psr b0531 + 21 ) , vela pulsar ( psr b0833 - 45 ) and geminga ( but not as pulsar in that moment ) were known as gamma - ray sources .",
    "the instruments on cgro have detected a total of 7 pulsars with high significance : crab , b1509 - 58 , vela , b1706 - 44 , b1951 + 32 , geminga , and b1055 - 52 .",
    "the weakest ( psr b1951 + 32 ) has a statistical probability of occurring by chance of @xmath35 .",
    "not all seven are seen at highest energies : psr b1509 - 58 is seen only up to 10 mev by comptel and not at 100 mev by egret .",
    "sensivity for an individual psr detection is greatly enhanced once studied phase - coherent .",
    "the six seen by egret all show a double peak in their light curve .",
    "in addition to the six high confidence pulsar detection above 100 mev , three additional radio pulsars may have been seen by egret : b1046 - 58 , b0656 + 14 , j0218 + 4232 .",
    "these three all have chance probabilities about 5 orders of magnitude less convincing than psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "more than 1500 radio pulsars are known and it can be expected that this number will continue to grow as more refined detection equipment is used and spatial coverage is expanded .",
    "the gamma ray pulsars can be compared to other pulsars in term of the derived physical parameters .",
    "figure 1 ( from reference @xcite ) displays the distribution of observed radio pulsars in a period - period - derivative diagram derived from australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) pulsar catalogue @xcite lines indicating the `` rotational '' age of the pulsars and their dipole field strength are also shown as well as the open field line voltage .",
    "the gamma - ray pulsars are shown as squares ( large dark boxes : seven high - confidence gamma - ray pulsars ; large light boxes : three lower - confidence gamma - ray pulsars ) .",
    "gamma ray pulsars tend to be concentrated in region with high magnetic field ( shown by dashed lines ) , relatively young ages ( shown by solid lines ) and their open field line voltage is high compared to most pulsars ( dotted lines ) .        efforts to search for additional pulsars in egret data have been unsuccessful due to limited statistics . in order to apply the stacking technique in the study of gamma - ray pulsars we created subclasses of pulsars using atnf pulsar survey after sorting them with different criteria : surface magnetic flux density ( @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the pulsar s period ) , best estimate of the pulsar distance ( @xmath38 ) , spin down energy loss rate ( @xmath39 ) , energy flux at the sun ( @xmath40 ) , spin down age ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the classes were chosen accordingly on what is already known about the gamma - ray pulsars that have been detected .",
    "we excluded from each list of subclasses those pulsars with @xmath42 and the detected egret pulsars : crab , j0633@xmath431746 , vela , psrb1055@xmath4452 , psrj1706@xmath4444 , psrb1951@xmath4332 ( see for example : @xcite and also j2229@xmath436114 @xcite ) . those high - gamma - ray flux pulsars were excluded because they inmediately determine the complete stacking problem .",
    "we first analyzed pulsars individually using the standard egret software .",
    "after that , for each class or subclass we have generated stacked maps containing n pulsars , with n=2 , 4 , 6 , ... , 50 .",
    "for each stacked map so generated , we have then determined the flux , flux error , upper limit , @xmath45 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath46 in the center of the maps and @xmath46 averaged over a @xmath47 box , approximately the size of egret s psf for energies @xmath48 100 mev.[stacking_pulsars ]",
    "figure 2 shows some of the results of our study for all the subclasses of pulsars investigated : @xmath39 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 .",
    "the plots represent the @xmath45 obtained ( left - axis ) and @xmath46 averaged over @xmath47 box ( right - axis ) versus the number of stacked maps .",
    "we did not find any signal in the @xmath40 class . @xmath49 and @xmath50 class both have similar behavior with a peak that appears at high n values in the sample .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath39 class has a peak that is dominated from a few sources .",
    "the @xmath38 class is more spread ; but a tendency to show high values of ts is apparent perhaps for the more nearby sources , then fading away when distances of about 1 kpc and larger are reached .",

    "there are several cases to distinguish already : ( a ) steadily accumulating @xmath46 as in figure 2 d ( d ) , which points towards an steadly increasing dominance of the diffuse emission , thus diminishing the chance for determine equal @xmath45 when adding more sources .",

    "see text.,scaledwidth=33.0% ]    accordingly to our results there is no more than 3 % chance of obtaining @xmath53 50 if 2 sources are added ; and no more than 6% if 10 ( not shown in figure 3 ) , 20 , 30 ( not shown in figure 3 ) , or 40 objects with zero flux are added randomly in the gp .",

    "in this paper a new technique to do source population studies using the stacking method in the gp is presented .",
    "different subclasses of pulsars were investigated . among all orderings of pulsars ,",
    "the one sorted by distance ( @xmath38 ) is the most promising , following the behavior that we expected previous to our study : @xmath45 signal fading away when the diffuse contribution grows .",
    "the fact that the ordering by @xmath40 does not appear to show a signal in the stacking is surprising and will be investigated for systematics in subsequent studies .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 classes start to show a signal for quite large number of pulsars , which may be due to the fact that only individual sources affect the stacking .",
    "we anticipate that the technique explained in this paper will have application in the study of galactic sources ( not only for psrs ) in glast era .",
