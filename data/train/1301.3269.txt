    "preconditioning methods for such linear systems in @xmath0 within the framework of domain decomposition methods , multigrid methods , and auxiliary space methods have been proposed by several authors , see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",

    "furthermore , the amli methods are robust with respect to the jumps in the operator coefficients ( where classical multigrid methods suffer ) , and are computationally advantageous than classical algebraic multigrid methods .    in this paper , we first derive the results for two - dimensional @xmath0 problem .",
