    "in this article , we investigate the spectral geometry of euclidean surfaces with conical singularities @xmath1 .",
    "we determine the precise microlocal structure of the half - wave propagator , @xmath3 , near a ray that undergoes one or two degenerate diffractions . using this , we compute the leading - order singularity of the trace of the half - wave group , @xmath4 , associated to an isolated periodic orbit undergoing two degenerate diffractions through cone points .",
    "for example , if the periodic orbit has length @xmath5 and undergoes degenerate diffractions through two cone points at a distance @xmath6 apart , we show that the associated wave trace singularity is @xmath7      spectral geometry typically aims at understanding the relations between the spectrum of the laplace operator on a riemannian manifold and the geometry of the associated geodesic flow . these relations may be revealed by the study of wave propagation .",
    "for instance , the poisson relation states that the trace of the wave propagator is smooth except possibly at the lengths of periodic orbits .",
    "moreover , in a generic and smooth situation , the singularity that is brought to the wave trace by a particular periodic orbit can be fully understood and leads to the definition of the so - called _ wave - invariants _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these wave - invariants may then be used for instance in inverse spectral problems .",
    "they also serve as a particular motivation to study wave propagation on different kind of singular surfaces .",
    "we will focus on euclidean surfaces with conical singularities since this general setting includes polygonal billiards and translation surfaces , both of which are very interesting and natural .",
    "the basic new feature of wave propagation on singular manifolds is the dichotomy between waves that hit the singularity  that are then diffracted in all possible directions  and waves that miss the singularity and propagate according to the usual laws for smooth manifolds .",
    "this fact leads to the definition of the so - called _ geometric ( or direct ) front _ that consists of rays that miss the vertex and the _ diffracted front _ that consists of rays that hit the vertex and are reemitted in all possible directions . on a two dimensional cone",
    ", these two fronts share two rays in common that correspond to the limit of rays that nearly miss the cone point from one side or the other . in the literature ,",
    "these two rays are called either `` geometrically diffractive '' @xcite or `` singular diffractive '' @xcite .",
    "we will use here the former terminology . on a compact surface with conical singularities",
    "the situation becomes quickly complicated for a diffractive ray may hit successive conical points and experience new diffractions that may be singular and so on .",
    "these diffractive phenomena are established in the quite abundant literature on wave propagation on singular manifolds starting with sommerfeld s result for euclidean sectors or cones @xcite . among the important milestones of this story",
    "are the studies by cheeger and taylor for cones of exact product - type @xcite and by melrose and wunsch in the general case @xcite .    over the years",
    ", there has been investigation of the impact of diffraction on the wave - trace .",
    "for instance , wunsch showed in @xcite that singularities may appear at length of periodic diffractive orbits .",
    "for some periodic diffractive geodesics , the leading singularity is then computed in @xcite in the euclidean case and in @xcite in a more general case ( see also @xcite for related results from a physics perspective ) .",
    "both these results are built upon a precise description of the wave propagator that is microlocalized in the vicinity of given periodic ( possibly diffractive ) geodesic . however ,",
    "none of these studies attempted to determine the precise microlocal nature of the propagator near a geometrically diffractive ray : in @xcite , it is assumed that no geometric diffraction occurs ( with a non - focusing assumption that would be automatically satisfied in our case ) , while in @xcite , it is assumed that the periodic geodesic has at most one geometric diffraction .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap , i.e. , to give a precise microlocal description of the wave propagator near the geometric diffractive rays , on an escs .",
    "more precisely , we will identify the microlocalized propagator near a ray that undergoes one or two geometric diffractions as an element of the melrose - uhlmann class of singular fourier integral operators ( @xcite ) , associated to either two , or four , lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "one advantage of this identification is the ease of computing wave trace singularities , such as , using standard methods such as stationary phase .",
    "this is the first article in a planned series of three . in the second paper",
    ", we will show how to compute wave traces for any closed orbit on an escs ( with any number of geometric diffractions ) . in the third paper",
    ", we will apply our results to inverse spectral results , specifically isospectral compactness in the class of escss . to keep the length of the present paper within reasonable bounds ,",
    "we restrict our attention here to at most two geometric diffractions .",
    "the euclidean cone of cone angle @xmath8 is the product manifold @xmath9 equipped with the exact warped product metric @xmath10 the vertex of the cone @xmath11 is the point where all @xmath12 are identified , and we will denote by @xmath13 the cone without its vertex .",
    "let us recall that the euclidean distance on @xmath14 between two points @xmath15 and @xmath16 in polar coordinates is : @xmath17    a euclidean surface @xmath2 with conical singularities ( denoted by escs in the sequel ) is a singular riemannian surface such that any point has a neighbourhood that is isometric either to a euclidean ball in @xmath18 or to a ball centered at the vertex of some euclidean cone @xmath14 .    from any polygonal domain @xmath19 in the plane",
    "we may generate an escs by taking two copies of the polygon , reflecting one of these copies across the @xmath20-axis , and identifying the corresponding sides .",
    "starting from a square , we build in this way a surface that is topologically a sphere that is flat with four singularities of angle @xmath21    more generally , a surface that is obtained by gluing euclidean polygons along their sides also is euclidean with conical singularities .",
    "the surface of a cube is a escs that is topologically a sphere with @xmath22 singularities of angle @xmath23    let @xmath2 be a euclidean surface with conical singularities , and let @xmath24 be the set of its conical points .",
    "define @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a smooth function that vanishes near the conical points . using the euclidean metric",
    ", one defines the gradient of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the action of the laplacian on @xmath26 , @xmath28 , as usual .",
    "the laplace operator thus defined is not essentially self - adjoint . among the possible self - adjoint extensions ,",
    "the most natural one is the friedrichs extension that is associated with the dirichlet energy quadratic form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the euclidean area measure . throughout the paper @xmath31",
    "will always define the friedrichs extension of the euclidean laplace operator . by choice it is a non - negative operator .",
    "writing @xmath32 with @xmath33 the associated wave operator is then defined as @xmath34 we will always take @xmath35 .",

    "it turns out that the wave kernel on @xmath14 is explicitly known ( see @xcite for different ways of constructing this kernel  we describe these briefly at the beginning of sections  [ sec : micro - structure ] and  [ sec : micro - structure - alpha ] ) .",
    "propagation of singularities for the wave equation on @xmath14 is then described as follows . using polar coordinates",
    ", we define on @xmath40 two lagrangian submanifolds @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "these can be defined as follows .",
    "the geometric ( or `` main '' ) lagrangian is @xmath44 the diffractive lagrangian is @xmath45 and their intersection is the singular set @xmath46    in the case @xmath47 , we choose an integer @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",
    "then we consider the @xmath48-fold covering map from @xmath50 to @xmath51 induced by the natural map @xmath52 . as",
    "this is a local isometry , this induces a covering map @xmath53 .",
    "we define @xmath54 to be the image of @xmath55 under this covering map .",
    "the terminology indicates that @xmath41 corresponds to geometric , or non - diffractive geodesics ( i.e. , geodesics on @xmath14 that avoid @xmath11 ) which carry the main singularity whereas @xmath42 corresponds to diffractive geodesics ( i.e. , concatenation of two rays emanating from @xmath11 . ) the singular set thus corresponds to diffractive geodesics that are limits of non - diffractive ones .",
    "we will refer to these as _ geometrically diffractive_. we will denote by @xmath56 the lagrangian submanifolds obtained by restricting @xmath57 to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the dual variable to @xmath60    the explicit expression of the propagator implies , first , that singularities propagate according to @xmath61 , and second , that away from the intersection @xmath62 the propagator is a classical fourier integral operator ( fio ) .",
    "away from the intersection @xmath62 , the kernel of the half - wave propagator @xmath3 is given by the so - called _ geometric theory of diffraction _",

    "is given by .    from this expression",
    "we deduce the following corollary .",
    "the half - wave propagator @xmath95 on the euclidean cone @xmath14 is in the melrose - uhlmann class @xmath96 of singular fourier integral operators .",
    "the order @xmath97 is equal to @xmath98 if @xmath99 is regarded as a parameter , or @xmath100 if @xmath99 is regarded as a ` spatial ' variable .",
    "similarly , the sine propagator @xmath101 on the euclidean cone @xmath14 is in the melrose - uhlmann class @xmath102 of singular fourier integral operators .",
    "it can be noted that elements of this class are standard fios away from the intersection @xmath62 so that this theorem does nt say anything new away from @xmath62 . on the other hand , although the explicit expression of the propagator was already known near @xmath62 , the fact that it belonged to the melrose - uhlmann class was not .",
    "it is also worth remarking that it may be possible to obtain the latter theorem by some brute computations starting from the explicit expression of the propagator .",
    "we propose a different method , the ` moving conical point ' method , that exploits geometric features of wave propagation on cones .",
    "it has the advantage that the parameter @xmath103 in then has geometric significance : it is the distance by which the conical point is shifted .",
    "it is actually convenient to use the riemannian metric to identify functions and half - densities .",
    "this amounts to multiply the oscillatory integral representation by the half - density @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "recall ( or see section  [ sec : int - lagn - distns ] ) that in the melrose - uhlmann calculus , the order of the distribution on the first lagrangian @xmath42 is @xmath106-order less than on the second , @xmath41 .",
    "this allows to recover the fact that the diffracted wave is @xmath106-order smoother ( in a sobolev sense ) than the direct wave ( in two dimensions ) .",
    "the oscillatory integral representation of the preceding theorem has several interesting applications mainly because it allows one to compute simply the wave propagator on an escs when microlocalized near a geodesic with several geometric diffractions .",
    "we will illustrate this by obtaining , for a geodesic with two geometric diffractions in a row an oscillatory integral representation that fits into the class of singular fio that is constructed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 710 ) and associated with a system of _ four _ intersecting lagrangians . more precisely , consider a geodesic of length @xmath99 between @xmath107 and @xmath108 with two geometric diffractions at @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "there are four types of nearby geodesics :    1 .",
    "non - diffractive geodesics ; 2 .",
    "geodesics that are diffractive at @xmath109 but not at @xmath110 ; 3 .",
    "non - diffractive geodesics at @xmath109 that diffract at @xmath110 ; and 4 .",
    "geodesics that diffracts at @xmath109 and @xmath111    each type corresponds to a particular lagrangian and these four lagrangians form a intersecting system in the sense of @xcite .    using the preceding theorem and standard stationary phase arguments we obtain the theorem .",
    "microlocally near a geodesic with two geometric diffractions , the half - wave propagator on a escs is in the melrose - uhlmann class of operators associated with a system of four intersecting lagrangians .",
    "we actually get much more accurate information since we can derive the principal symbol of the half - wave propagator on the twice diffracted front  see and .",
    "finally we will use our new expression for @xmath83 to compute the contribution to the wave - trace of an isolated periodic geodesic with two geometric diffractions .    on a escs ,",
    "the leading contribution to the wave trace of an isolated periodic diffractive orbit with two geometric diffractions is @xmath112    this is perhaps the simplest setting for which neither @xcite nor @xcite applies .",
    "this proposition shows that such a geodesic creates in the wave - trace a singularity that is comparable to the singularity that is created in a smooth setting by an isolated periodic orbit .",
    "the singularity is @xmath113 stronger than a diffractive geodesic with one non - geometric diffraction and @xmath113 weaker than a cylinder of periodic orbits .    with our new representation of the wave kernel",
    ", it should actually be possible to compute the full asymptotic expansion of the contribution to the wave - trace of any kind of periodic diffractive geodesic .",
    "this is a far - reaching generalization of results in @xcite and it leads to the possible computation of many wave - invariants .",
    "this opens new questions concerning inverse spectral problems in this kind of geometric setting which , we recall , includes euclidean polygons .",
    "for instance it can be asked whether the full asymptotic expansion of a particular geodesic allows to recover the full picture describing the geodesic : that is the number of diffractions , the lengths of the legs between two diffractions , the diffraction angles and the angles of the cone at which the diffractions occur .",
    "we will tackle some of these questions in the second and third parts of this series .      in section [ sec : int - lagn - distns ] we will recall the definition of singular fourier integral operators as defined in @xcite .",
    "we will first study the case of two intersecting lagrangians",
    ". we will give the oscillatory integral representation using a phase function that depends on an extra parameter @xmath103 .",
    "we will then give the generalization to a system of four intersecting lagrangians .    in section [ sec : micro - structure ] we will study wave propagation on a cone of total angle @xmath114",
    "the first reason why we study this particular cone is that it is the simplest case in which we can implement our method of ` moving the conical point ' that leads to our new expression for the wave propagator .",
    "the fact that the wave propagator belongs to the melrose - uhlmann class can then be directly read off from this expression .",
    "it is also worth remarking that , in this case the extra parameter @xmath103 has a geometric meaning since it represents the amount of which the conical point has moved .    the second reason why we can first study the cone of angle @xmath115 is that the most singular part of the wave propagator near @xmath62 actually does not depend on its angle .",
    "this can be seen using the construction of the wave kernel made by friedlander in @xcite .",
    "we will recall this fact in section [ sec : micro - structure - alpha ] and then proceed to prove theorem [ thm : intro - kernel ] .",
    "in section [ sec : wave - kernel - two - diffractions ] we will use theorem [ thm : intro - kernel ] to compute the wave propagator when microlocalized near some particular kind of geodesics .",
    "we will focus on the case of a geodesic with two geometric diffractions for which a desciption of the microlocalized propagator is not already available in the literature .",
    "in section [ sec : wave - invariants ] we will end this paper by computing the leading contribution to the wave - trace of an isolated periodic orbit with two geometric diffractions .",
    "the class of distributions central to our study of the wave propagators on @xmath14 is that of intersecting lagrangian distributions , introduced by melrose and uhlmann @xcite .",
    "these are distributions whose singularities ( in terms of wavefront set ) lie along a pair of conic lagrangian submanifolds @xmath116 of the cotangent bundle . here",
