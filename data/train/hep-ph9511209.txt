    "the mass of the electron s anti - neutrino @xmath3 has been measured in several tritium beta decay experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments are quite sensitive to a possible neutrino mass since the end - point energy @xmath4 in this beta decay is very small ( @xmath5 kev ) , and an examination of the beta ray energy spectra near the end point region can thus reveal a small neutrino mass . on the other hand , the very smallness of the decay energy implies that the coulomb interactions between the outgoing beta electron and the atomic electron in the final helium ion may play a significant role in the interpretation of the experiments . in units where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the strength of this coulomb interactions is governed by the parameter @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fine structure constant and @xmath10 is the emitted beta electron velocity , or , equivalently , where @xmath11 is the bohr radius and @xmath12 is the momentum of the outgoing beta ray . since the end - point energy @xmath13 is small",
    ", the beta electron velocity is small and the coulomb parameter @xmath14 is relatively large . near the tritium decay end point , @xmath15 .    to study a small neutrino mass , modern experiments use data from the beta ray spectrum end point to approximately @xmath16 below the end point @xcite .",
    "the actual experiments work with molecular tritium .",
    "the theoretical formula for the spectrum used in the analysis of the experimental data is the sudden approximation result for the molecular final states which neglects the coulomb interaction between the beta ray electron and the electrons in the daughter @xmath17 molecule @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate the coulomb interaction effect , hereafter referred to as the atomic effect , and estimate its size . instead of molecular tritium",
    ", we calculate the effect for atomic tritium , where the calculation is simpler and brings out the essential points .",
    "the calculation for molecular tritium would be parallel to that of atomic tritium , but much more complicated .",
    "currently , tritium beta decay experiments appear to find a squared electron neutrino mass which is negative , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there are two relevant dimensional parameters which enter here : the atomic energy scale @xmath19 and the energy range @xmath20 where the experimentalists fit their data .",
    "typically , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , apart from potentially large numerical factors , the effect of the atomic corrections on the determination of the the neutrino mass squared may be of order @xmath22 as well as @xmath23 .",
    "we shall provide a detailed analysis of how much the atomic effect influences the neutrino mass squared parameter .    the sudden approximation spectrum used for fitting",
    "the experimental data takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath12 are the energy and momentum of the outgoing beta electron and @xmath26 is the neutrino mass squared .",
    "the spectrum  ( [ expspectrum0 ] ) needs some explanation .",
    "the first factor @xmath27 is an overall constant , and @xmath28 is the usual fermi function , which is the square of the beta ray wave function evaluated at the @xmath0 nucleus , for the @xmath29 charged helium nucleus .",
    "the atomic transition probability @xmath30 for the initial tritium state @xmath31 decaying to the particular final ionic state @xmath32 is the squared matrix element @xmath33 the energy release @xmath34 is that for the decay process which starts with the initial tritium atomic energy @xmath35 and ends with the final @xmath36 ion energy @xmath37 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath38 on the sum over states is set by the conservation of energy .",

    ", we shall neglect relativistic corrections and treat the beta ray non - relativistically .",
    "this is valid since relativistic effects , of order @xmath43 , provide only small corrections that can easily be accounted for .",

    "the correction to the atomic effect is of the order @xmath45 , which is negligible@xcite .",
    "in calculating the beta ray decay rate , the usual perturbative expansion@xcite uses the coulomb potential produced by the final helium nucleus as the zeroth - order approximation for the potential experienced by the emitted beta electron",
    ". this zeroth - order approximation does not describe the long distance behavior of the potential in which the real beta ray moves since the screening effect of the outside electron has not been taken care of .",
    "therefore , infrared divergences appear and make the usual perturbative calculation inconvenient .",
    "using field - theoretic methods involving the reduction technique , we shall instead make use of a conveniently chosen effective potential as the zeroth - order approximation .",

    "we shall compute the first term in this expansion , which is of order @xmath46 , for the decays into the individual final ionic states .",

    "the uniform phase space factor approximation takes the neutrino phase space factor , which depends on the final helium ionic energy , to be the same for different final helium ionic states .",
    "the energy of the final ionic state appearing in the phase space factor is replaced by the helium ionic ground state energy@xcite . within this uniform phase space factor approximation , references @xcite then make the closure approximation , which extends the upper limit @xmath38 of the sum over final helium ionic states to infinite energy .",
    "the closure approximation over counts contributions from the final helium ionic states whose energies lie above the limit set by energy conservation . in most regions of the beta ray spectrum ,",
    "this approximation is valid because the limit determined by energy conservation is much higher than the atomic energy scale .",
    "however , the closure approximation can not be used for the region near the end point of the beta ray spectrum since here little energy remains to excite the final helium ionic states , and threshold effects must be taken into account . since the shape of the beta ray energy spectra near the end point region is crucial for the neutrino mass measurement , we shall not rely on either the closure approximation or the uniform phase space factor approximation .",

    "fitting formulas for the beta ray spectrum are given for the region near the end point . in appendix",
    "a , we calculate the value of the wave function of the beta ray at the origin for the sudden approximation . our evaluation of this amplitude confirms an old result @xcite and shows , incidentally , that it is accurate through terms of order @xmath90 rather than being valid only through order @xmath1 .",

    "in appendix d , we investigate the nature of the exchange corrections .",
    "these correspond to the process in which the electron produced by the weak interaction is bound in the final @xmath0 ion with the initial tritium atomic electron being ejected .",
    "we show that the leading exchange corrections to the _ amplitude _ are of order @xmath90 , in contradiction with the previous order @xmath91 estimate that has appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "the exchange corrections to the decay _ rate _ , however , are of order @xmath91 .",
    "we should emphasize that , although the corrections which we have found for the neutrino mass determination from tritium beta decay are not significant , the methods which we have developed to treat the problem may be useful in the examination of other beta decay processes .",
    "since the emitted beta ray has a maximum energy of @xmath92 kev , in natural units where @xmath6 , the square of the electron velocity is less than 0.1 , it is valid to treat the electron non - relativistically .",
    "the interactions due to the spins of electrons and nucleons are relativistic effects .",
    "therefore , the spectrum is not significantly affected by the spins of these non - relativistic particles except for an overall constant which accounts for the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , the effective hamiltonian for the beta decay for our purpose may be written in the form @xmath93 where the operators @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are spinless field operators , which destroy the proton , neutron , electron , and neutrino , respectively .",
