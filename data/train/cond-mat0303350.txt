    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are attracting much attention lately due to their potential for device applications in the growing field of spintronics .",
    "in particular , a large number of dms studies have focused on iii - v compounds where mn doping in inas and gaas has been achieved using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) techniques .",
    "the main result of recent experimental efforts is the discovery@xcite of ferromagnetism at a curie temperature @xmath1@xmath2110  k in ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as , with mn concentrations @xmath5 up to 10% .",
    "it is widely believed that this ferromagnetism is `` carried induced '' , with holes donated by mn ions mediating a ferromagnetic interaction between the randomly localized mn@xmath6 spins . in practice ,",
    "anti - site defects reduce the number of holes @xmath7 from its ideal value @xmath7=@xmath5 , leading to a ratio @xmath8=@xmath9 substantially smaller than 1 .    until recently",
    ", theoretical descriptions of dms materials could be roughly classified in two categories .",
    "on one hand , the multi - band nature of the problem is emphasized as a crucial aspect to quantitatively understand these materials.@xcite in this context the lattice does not play a key role and a continuum formulation is sufficient .",
    "the influence of disorder is considered on average . on the other hand , formulations based on the possible strong localization of carriers at the mn - spin sites",
    "have also been proposed.@xcite in this context a single impurity - band description is considered sufficient for these materials . still within the single - band framework , but with carrier hopping not restricted to the mn locations , recent approaches to the problem have used dynamical mean - field@xcite or reduced - basis@xcite approximations .",
    "an effective hamiltonian for ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as was derived in the dilute limit and studied in ref .  .",
    "all these calculations are important in our collective effort to understand dms materials .    however , it is desirable to obtain a more general view of the problem of ferromagnetism induced by a diluted set of spins and holes . to reach this goal",
    "it would be better to use techniques that do not rely on mean - field approximations and , in addition , select a model that has both the continuum and impurity - band formulations as limiting cases .",
    "such an approach would provide information on potential procedures to further enhance @xmath1 and clarify the role of the many parameters in the problem .",
    "in addition , these general considerations will be useful beyond the specific details of ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as , allowing us to reach conclusions for other dms .",
    "an effort in this direction was recently initiated by mayr and two of the authors.@xcite a detailed monte carlo study of a simple model for dms already allowed us to argue that @xmath1 could be further enhanced perhaps even to room temperature by further increasing @xmath5 and @xmath8 from current values in dms samples .",
    "these predictions seem in agreement with recent experimental developments since very recently ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as samples with @xmath1 as high as @xmath10 k were prepared,@xcite a result believed to be caused by an enhanced free - hole density . also samples with @xmath11",
    "k and @xmath12 were reported in ref .  , and , very recently , a @xmath1 of 140k was achieved on high quality gamnas films grown with arsenic dimers.@xcite there seems to be plenty of room to further increase the critical temperatures according to these theoretical calculations .",
    "the model used in ref .   was a single - band lattice hamiltonian , also studied by other groups , which does not have the multi - band characteristics and spin - orbit couplings of the real problem .",
    "however , it contains spin and holes in interaction and it is expected to capture the main qualitative aspects of carrier - induced ferromagnetism in dms materials .",
    "the choice of a single - band model allows us to focus on the essential aspects of the problem , leaving aside the numerical complexity of the multi - band hamiltonian , which unfortunately can not be studied with reliable numerical techniques at present without introducing further approximations.@xcite note that a quite similar philosophy has been followed in the related area of manganites for many years .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that the orbital order present in those compounds can only be studied with a two - band model . however , single - band approaches are sufficient to investigate the competition between ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic states , an effect recently argued to be at the heart of the colossal magnetoresistance phenomenon.@xcite as a consequence , a qualitatively reliable study of the single - band dms model  with itinerant holes and localized classical spins ",
    "is expected to be important for progress in the dms context as well .    in our previous publication@xcite the phase diagram of the single - band model for dms",
    "was already sketched.@xcite this phase diagram is reproduced in fig.[fig : summary ] .",
    "the only parameter in the hamiltonian is the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath13 is the local anti - ferromagnetic coupling between the spins of carriers and localized mn@xmath6 ions , and @xmath14 is the carrier - hopping amplitude ( for details , see the full form of the hamiltonian in the next section ) . due to its large value 5/2",
    ", the mn spin is assumed to be classical for numerical simplicity . at small @xmath0 ,",
    "individual carriers are only weakly bounded to the mn spins .",
    "even for small realistic values of @xmath5 , the carrier wave functions strongly overlap and a large - bandwidth itinerant band dominates the physics . in this regime",
    ", @xmath1 grows with @xmath0 .",
    "this portion of the phase diagram is referred to as ` weak coupling ' in fig.[fig : summary ] , and in our opinion it qualitatively corresponds to the continuum - limit approach pursued in refs .  .",
    "in the other extreme of large @xmath0 , the previous effort@xcite found a @xmath1 that is much suppressed , converging to zero as @xmath0 increases ( at least at small values of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the strong localization of carriers at mn spin locations , to take advantage of the strong @xmath13 coupling .",
    "the localization suppresses the mobility and the carrier - induced mechanism is no longer operative .",
    "however , when several mn spins are close to one another small regions can be magnetized efficiently . as a consequence , a picture emerges where small islands of ferromagnetism are produced at a fairly large temperature scale @xmath15 ( @xmath16@xmath1 ) that grows with @xmath13 , but a global ferromagnetic state is only achieved upon further reducing the temperature such that the overlaps of wave functions induce a percolation - like process that aligns the individual preformed clusters the proper procedure to distinguish between these two regimes is through an analysis of short- and long - distance spin correlations . in our opinion , the effort of refs",
    ".   belongs to this class , and it corresponds to the ` strong coupling ' region of fig.[fig : summary ] . between the weak and strong coupling domains , an _ intermediate region _ provides a natural interpolation between those two extreme cases .",
    "the curie temperature is optimal ( i.e. , the largest ) in this intermediate zone , at fixed values of @xmath8 and @xmath5 . in this regime , there is sufficient interaction between the clusters to become globally ferromagnetic , and at the same time the @xmath13 is sufficiently strong to induce a robust @xmath1 . if chemical control over @xmath0 were possible , this intermediate region would be the most promising to increase the curie temperature ( again , at fixed @xmath5 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , it may even occur that the dms materials are already in the intermediate optimal range of @xmath0 couplings . an indirect way to test this hypothesis relies on calculations of dynamical and transport properties , which are presented in this paper , and its comparison with experiments .",
    "in particular , the experimentally measured d.c .",
    "resistivity @xmath17 of dms compounds has a nontrivial shape with a ( poor ) metallic ( d@xmath17/d@xmath18@xmath160 ) behavior below @xmath1 , which turns to insulating ( d@xmath17/d@xmath18@xmath190 ) at higher temperatures .",
    "this nontrivial profile resembles results reported in the area of manganites , which also have a metal - insulator transition as a function of temperature,@xcite although in those materials the changes in resistivity with temperature are far more dramatic than in dms .",
    "the formal similarities dms - manganites have already been remarked in previous literature,@xcite and suggest a common origin of the @xmath17 vs. temperature curves . in mn - oxides",
    "it is believed that above the curie temperature , preformed ferromagnetic clusters with random orientations contribute to the insulating behavior of those materials.@xcite for dms , a similar rationalization can be envisioned if the state of relevance above @xmath1 has preformed magnetic clusters .",
    "from the previous discussion@xcite it is known that the intermediate @xmath0 region can have clusters without collapsing @xmath1 to a very small value . at the curie temperature",
    ", the alignment of these preformed moments leads to a metallic state .",
    "an explicit calculation of the resistivity  using techniques borrowed from the mesoscopic physics context  is provided in this paper , and the results support the conjecture that clustered states can explain the transport properties of dms . these unveiled analogies with manganites are not just accidental . clearly , approaches to dms that rely on mobile carriers and localized spins in interaction have close similarities with the standard single - band double - exchange model where only one @xmath20-orbital is considered .",
    "the key difference is the presence of strong dilution in dms as compared with manganites .",
    "it is interesting to remark that in agreement with the ` clustered ' state described here , recently timm and von oppen have shown that _ correlated _ defects in dms are needed to describe experimental data.@xcite their simulations with coulombic effects incorporated lead to cluster formation , with sizes well beyond those obtained from a random distribution of mn sites as considered here . in this respect , the results of ref .",
    "provide an even more dramatic clustered state than ours .",
    "if the mn spins were not distributed randomly in our simulations but in a correlated manner , the state above @xmath1 would be even more insulating than reported below and the physics would resemble much closer that observed in manganites . note also that kaminski and das sarma have also independently arrived to a polaronic state@xcite that qualitatively resembles the clustered state discussed here .",
    "it is also interesting that in recent ion - implanted ( ga , mn)p : c experiments that reported a high curie temperature , the presence of ferromagnetic clusters were observed and they were attributed to disorder and the proximity to a metal - insulator transition.@xcite even directly in ( ga , mn)as , the inverse magnetic susceptibility deviates from the curie law at temperatures above @xmath1 ( fig.2(b ) of ref .  ) , which may be an indication of an anomalous behavior . in manganites , these same anomalies in the susceptibility",
    "are indeed taken as evidence of the formation of clusters.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] the details of the method of simulation , definitions , and conventions are presented .",
    "section [ sec : dos ] describes the results for the density - of - states ( dos ) of this model , the appearance of an `` impurity band '' at large @xmath0 , and the relation of the dos with the optimal @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature and carrier dependence of the optical conductivity and drude weight are presented in section [ sec : sigma ] , with results compared with experiments . in section",
    "[ sec : conductance ] , the resistance of a small cluster is calculated and also compared with experimental data .",
    "the intermediate coupling regime is the only one found to qualitatively reproduce the available resistivity vs. temperature curves . from this perspective , both the weak and strong coupling limits are not realistic to address dms materials . in section [ sec : magnet ] , the influence of a magnetic field is studied by calculating the magnetoresistance .",
    "large effects are observed .",
    "section [ sec : cluster ] describes the characteristics of the clustered - state regime above @xmath1 at strong coupling .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] the ` transport ' phase diagram is presented , and it is discussed in what region it appears to be the most relevant to qualitatively reproduce results for ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as mbe - grown films .",
    "there are two degrees of freedom in the dms problem described here : ( i ) the local magnetic moments corresponding to the 5 electrons in the @xmath21 shell of each mn impurity , with a total spin 5/2 , and ( ii ) the itinerant carriers produced by the mn impurities .",
    "since these mn impurities substitute ga atoms in the zinc - blende structure of gaas , there is , in principle , one hole per mn .",
    "however , it has been found that the system is heavily compensated and , as a consequence , the actual concentration of carriers is lower . in the present study ,",
    "both the density of mn atoms , @xmath5 , and the density of carriers , @xmath7 , are treated as independent input parameters .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath22 is defined , which is a measure of the compensation of the system , e.g. for @xmath23 the system is totally compensated and for @xmath24 there is no compensation .",
    "+ the hamiltonian of the system in the one - band approximation can be written as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 creates a carrier at site @xmath27 with spin @xmath28 .",
    "the carrier - spin operator interacting antiferromagnetically with the localized mn - spin @xmath29 is @xmath30 . through nearest - neighbor hopping",
    ", the carriers can hop to @xmath31 site of the square or cubic lattice .",
    "the interaction term is restricted to a randomly selected but fixed set of sites , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "note that in addition to the use of a single band , there are other approximation in the model described here : ( i ) the hubbard @xmath33 is not included .",
    "this is justified based on the low - carrier concentration of the problem , since in this case the probability of double occupancy is small . in addition , mn - oxide investigations@xcite have shown that an intermediate or large @xmath13 coupling acts similarly as @xmath33 , also suppressing double occupancy .",
    "( ii ) a nearest - neighbors anti - ferromagnetic coupling between the mn spins is not included . again",
    ", this is justified as long as @xmath5 is small .",
    "( iii ) finally , also potential disorder is neglected ( together with the spin , the mn sites should in principle act as charge trapping centers ) .",
    "this approximation is not problematic when the fermi energy is larger than the width of the disorder potential ( i.e. large @xmath8 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , in the ( @xmath8 , @xmath5 ) range analyzed in this paper it becomes more questionable to neglect this effect .",
    "its influence will be studied in a future publication .    in the present study",
    "the carriers are considered to be electrons and the kinetic term describes a conduction band . however , in ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as the carriers are holes and the valence band has to be considered instead .",
    "although the latter is more complicated , the simplified treatment followed here should yield similar results for both cases.@xcite + the local spins are assumed to be classical which allows the parametrization of each local spin in terms of spherical coordinates : @xmath34 . the exact - diagonalization method for the fermionic sector",
    "is described in this section , following ref .  .",
    "the partition function can be written as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the partition function of the fermionic sector , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the number operator , and @xmath39 is the chemical potential . + in the following , an hypercubic lattice of dimension @xmath40 , length @xmath41 , and number of sites @xmath42 will be considered .",
    "since @xmath43 is a hermitian operator , it can be represented in terms of a hermitian matrix which can be diagonalized by an unitary matrix @xmath44 such that @xmath45 the basis in which the matrix @xmath46 is diagonal is given by the eigenvectors @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where the fermionic operators used in this basis are obtained from the original operators through @xmath50=@xmath51 , with @xmath52 running from 1 to @xmath53 .",
    "defining @xmath54=@xmath55 and denoting by @xmath56 the eigenvalues of @xmath55 , the trace can be written @xmath57 since in the @xmath58 basis , the operator @xmath59 is @xmath60 , and the number operator can be replaced by its eigenvalues .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : partition1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath61 which is the formula used in the simulations .",
    "the integral over the angular variables in eq .",
    "( [ eq : partition ] ) can be performed using a classical monte carlo simulation.@xcite the eigenvalues must be obtained for each classical spin configuration using library subroutines .",
    "finding the eigenvalues is the most time consuming part of the numerical simulation .",
    "the integrand is clearly positive .",
    "thus , `` sign problems '' in which the integrand of the multiple integral under consideration can be non - positive , are fortunately not present in our study .",
    "+ although the formalism is in the grand - canonical ensemble , the chemical potential was adjusted to give the desired carrier density , @xmath7 . to do so",
    ", the equation @xmath62 was solved for @xmath39 at every monte carlo step by using the newton - raphson method.@xcite this technique proved very efficient in adjusting with precision the desired electronic density and , as a consequence , our analysis can be considered as in the canonical ensemble as well , with a fixed number of carriers .",
    "+ usually , 2,000 - 5,000 monte carlo iterations were used to let the system thermalize , and then 5,000 -10,000 additional steps were carried out to calculate observables , measuring every five of these steps to reduce autocorrelations .",
    "+ since for fixed parameters there are many possibilities for the random location of mn impurities , results are averaged over several of these disorder configurations .",
    "approximately 10 - 20 disorder configurations were generally used for small lattices ( @xmath63 and 10@xmath6410 ) and 4 - 8 for larger lattices",
    "( @xmath65 and 12@xmath6412 ) .",
    "the inevitable uncertainties arising from the use of a small number of disorder configuration does not seem to affect in any dramatic way our conclusions below .",
    "this is deduced from the analysis of results for individual disorder samples .",
    "the qualitative trends emphasized in the present paper are present in all of these configurations .",
    "quantities that depend on the mn degrees of freedom ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the previous formalism ) are calculated simply by averaging over the monte carlo configurations .",
    "note that any observable that does not have the continuous symmetry of the hamiltonian will vanish over very long runs .",
    "thus , it is standard in this context to calculate the absolute value of the magnetization , @xmath68 , as opposed to the magnetization vector .",
    "another useful quantity is the spin - spin correlation , defined by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of non - zero terms in the sum .",
    "the correlation at a distance @xmath21 is averaged over all lattice points that are separated by that distance , but since the system is diluted , the quantity must be normalized to the number of pairs of spins separated by @xmath21 , to compare the results for different distances .",
    "+ the observables that directly depend on the electronic degrees of freedom can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath43 .",
    "the dos , @xmath71 , is simply given by @xmath72 .",
    "however , the majority and minority dos , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , were also calculated in this study .",

    "conductivity properties of the cluster , the `` mesoscopic '' conductance was also calculated in order to gather additional information .",
    "the details are explained in section  [ sec : conductance ] .",
    "in this section , the density - of - states calculated at several couplings is shown and discussed .",
    "a few basic facts about the dos of the model , eq .  ( [ eq : ham ] ) , are presented first .",
    "if carrier localization effects are not taken into account and a ferromagnetic state is considered at strong @xmath0 coupling , then two spin - split bands ( `` impurity bands '' ) will appear for this model , each with weight proportional to @xmath5 , at each side of the unperturbed band which would have weight @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : doscartoon ] ) . for partially compensated samples , @xmath91",
    ", the chemical potential will be located somewhere in the first spin - split band , and , as a consequence , only this band would be relevant in the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) .    in practice ,",
    "monte carlo simulations show that , in the regime of interest where @xmath1 is optimal , the impurity band is not completely separated from the unperturbed band . for this reason ,",
    "both the unperturbed band and the impurity band have to be considered in quantitative calculations . to illustrate this , figure [ fig : dosparamj ] shows @xmath71 vs. @xmath92 for different @xmath0 s in two dimensions . with growing @xmath0 ,",
    "the `` impurity band '' begins to form for @xmath93 , and at @xmath94 it is already fairly separated from the main band . however , note that for this extreme regime of @xmath0 , @xmath1 is far lower than for @xmath95 , as discussed before in ref .  .",
    "in fact , the optimal @xmath0 for the @xmath96 parameters used here was found to be in the range 2.0 - 4.0 .",
    "this implies that the model shows the highest @xmath1 when the `` impurity band '' is about to form , but it is not yet separated from the main band .",
    "this introduces an important difference between our approach to dms materials , and the theoretical calculations presented in ref .  .",
    "figure [ fig : dosparamj3d](a)-(c ) indicates that a similar behavior is found in three dimensions . in this case , once again , the optimal @xmath1 occurs for intermediate @xmath0 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dosparamj3d](d ) where the phase diagram obtained from a @xmath65 lattice with @xmath5=@xmath97 and @xmath8=@xmath98 is shown .",
    "+ the physical reason for this behavior is that at very large @xmath0 , the states of the impurity band are highly localized where the mn spins are .",
    "local ferromagnetism can be easily formed , but global ferromagnetism is suppressed by the concomitant weak coupling between magnetized clusters .    both , figures [ fig : dosparamj ] and [ fig : dosparamj3d ] represent results obtained at particular values of parameters @xmath5=@xmath97 , @xmath8=@xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "however , results for several other sets @xmath100 were gathered as well ( not shown ) .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the dos is simple : increasing @xmath5 produces a proportional increase in the number of states of the impurity band , and a corresponding decrease of the main band weight ( see fig.[fig : doscartoon ] ) . in terms of @xmath8 , increasing the effective carrier concentration by a small amount",
    "was found to simply shift the chemical potential to the right .",
    "concerning the temperature dependence of the dos , at low temperature the states contributing to the impurity band are polarized , i.e. the system is ferromagnetic , as shown by the different weights of the majority and minority bands ( figs .",
    "[ fig : dosparamj ] and [ fig : dosparamj3d ] ) . as the temperature increases",
    ", spin disorder grows due to thermal fluctuations , and when @xmath101 , i.e. in the paramagnetic regime , the bands become symmetric .",
    "it appears that the only change that a small increase in the carrier concentration produces is an increase in the chemical potential . however , experimentally the appearance of a pseudo - gap at the fermi energy has been reported.@xcite although the finite size effects in the present theoretical calculation do not allow for a detailed study of @xmath71 at or very near the fermi energy with high enough precision , in certain cases a pseudo - gap was indeed observed in the present study at the chemical potential , particularly when the system is in the clustered regime . while this result certainly needs confirmation , it is tempting to draw analogies with the more detailed calculations carried out in the context of manganites , where the presence of a pseudo - gap both in theoretical models and in experiments is well established.@xcite pseudo - gaps are also present in under - doped high temperature superconductors",
    ". given the analogies between dms materials and transition - metal oxides unveiled in previous investigations,@xcite it would not be surprising that dms presents a pseudo - gap in the clustered regime as well .",
    "more work is needed to confirm these speculations .",
    "results presented in this section for the dos qualitatively agree with those found in ref .",
    "using the dynamical mean - field technique ( dmft ) in the coupling regime studied there .",
    "however , the dmft approach is a mean - field approximation local in space and , as a consequence , the state emphasized in this paper with randomly distributed clusters can not be studied accurately with such a technique",

    "it is interesting to remark that half the total width of the impurity band obtained in our simulations is about @xmath102 ( see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : dosparamj ] and [ fig : dosparamj3d ] ) , and using @xmath14=@xmath98ev@xcite this is equal to 0.6ev , in good agreement with the width 0.5ev estimated from the photoemission experimental measurements mentioned before.@xcite    the local dos is studied next .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to further understand the inhomogeneous state that forms as a consequence of mn - spin dilution and concomitant carrier localization .",
    "the local dos is shown in fig .",

    "only , an arrangement of classical spins was introduced ` by hand ' such that the clusters are clearly formed .",
    "in this way , sites can easily be classified in three groups , as discussed below . despite using a particularly chosen spin configuration ,",
    "the resulting dos is similar to those obtained previously ( fig.[fig : dosparamj ] ) using a truly random distribution of spins .",
    "lattice sites are classified as follows : the first group is defined to contain lattice sites that have a classical spin and belong to a spin cluster .",
    "the second class is composed of sites that have an isolated classical spin , i.e. nearby sites do not have other classical spins . finally , lattice sites without classical spins in the same site or its vicinity belong to the third class . @xmath107 ,",
    "@xmath108 , and @xmath109 denote the local dos at sites corresponding to each of the three classes , respectively .",
    "it can be observed that @xmath107 contributes to states inside the impurity band ( note the sharp peak near -1 ) , but also contributes to the main band since the @xmath0 used is intermediate .",
    "@xmath108 contributes a sharp peak near zero , and also has weight in the main band .",
    "this can be explained as follows : the electron is weakly localized at an isolated site yielding a state at @xmath110 or , since @xmath111 for @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( see fig.[fig : ldos]a ) .",
    "this interesting result shows that many of the states near zero in figs.[fig : dosparamj ] and [ fig : dosparamj3d ] may be _ localized _ , and they do not contribute to the conductivity .",
    "finally , in @xmath109 the empty sites contribute weight only in nearly unperturbed states , i.e. , states that belong to the main band . in conclusion , the local carrier density is very inhomogeneous and this fact has an important effect on the form of the site - integrated dos .",
    "our results show that scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments would be able to reveal the clustered structure proposed here , if it indeed exists , when applied to dms materials .",
    "in the previous section , it was argued that at the optimal coupling @xmath0  where @xmath1 is maximized  the impurity band is not completely separated from the main band .",
    "this conclusion is supported by results obtained from the optical conductivity as well , which is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : swparamj](a ) for a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "this optical conductivity has two main features : ( i ) a zero - frequency or drude peak and ( ii ) a finite - frequency broad peak which is believed to correspond to transitions from the impurity band to the main band , as argued below . from fig .",
    "[ fig : swparamj](a ) , it is observed that inter - band transitions are not much relevant at weak coupling ( @xmath0=@xmath114 ) , but they appear with more weight at intermediate couplings ( @xmath0=@xmath115 ) , where @xmath1 is optimal .",
    "it is worth remarking that at @xmath0 strong enough , e.g. @xmath0=@xmath116 , when the impurity band is well - formed , the finite - frequency peak is weaker in strength than for the optimal @xmath0 due to localization .",
    "in fact , if @xmath0 were so large that the `` impurity band '' is completely separated from the unperturbed band , then carrier localization would be so strong that inter - band transitions would not be possible .",
    "the drude peak is plotted separately in fig .",
