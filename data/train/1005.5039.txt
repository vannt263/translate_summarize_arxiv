    "they also studied the influence of the external illumination on the structure of the disk , considering the point source model , where a compact source of non - thermal radiation located at a given height illuminates the disk and the diffusion model , where the radiation of a central source is scattered back towards the disk by a hot diffusing medium .",
    "one of the first methods for calculating the profiles of optical emission lines from a relativistic accretion disk was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the limitation to this method is that the accretion disk structure required to explain the variability of the line profiles can not be axi - symmetric , i.e. very often the red peak is higher than blue one and that can not be explained by this model .",
    "it is not possible in a circular disk , in which the blue peak is always doppler boosted to be stronger than the red peak .",
    "therefore , @xcite adapted the circular accretion disk model to elliptical disks in order to fit the profiles of double - peaked emitters with a red peak stronger than the blue one .",

    "patterns in the variability of the broad balmer lines are often a gradual change and reversal of the relative strengths of the blue - shifted and red - shifted peaks ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "periodic variability of the red and blue peak strengths has also been attributed to a precessing elliptical disk , a precessing single - armed spiral ( as e.g. 3c 332 , 3c 390.3 : @xcite ; ngc 1097 : @xcite ) , and a precessing warp in the disk .",
    "for instance , @xcite computed the profiles of balmer emission lines from a relativistic , warped accretion disk in order to explore the certain asymmetries in the double - peaked emission line profiles which can not be explained by a circular keplerian disk .",
    "elliptical disks and spiral waves have been detected in cataclysmic variables @xcite , and a radiation induced warp has been detected in the large - scale disk of the agn ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "spiral waves are a physically desirable model since they can be produced by instability in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "they can play an important role in accretion disks , because they provide a mechanism for transporting angular momentum outward in the disk , allowing the gas to flow inwards , towards the central black hole .",

    "here we introduce the model and some approximations used in the simulations of accretion disk perturbation .      as we mentioned above",
    ", the dp line profile variability does not appear to correlate with changes in the line and/or continuum flux , and consequently one can assume that the changes in line profile are likely caused by changes in the accretion disk structure .",
    "there are several examples of the long - term variability ( on timescales of several years ) of the dp line profile of some objects which has been successfully modeled by the precession of a non - axisymmetric accretion disk , such as an elliptical disk or a disk with a spiral arm ( * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , these authors suggest that many of the observed variability patterns could be reproduced assuming a disk with one or more fragmented spiral arms .    other attempts to explain the dp line profile variability through perturbations of the disk structure introduced bright spots over an axisymmetric accretion disk . as an example @xcite successfully modeled the variation of the h@xmath1 peak intensity ratio of arp 102b with a single spot rotating within the disk , but @xcite were not able to apply the same model to the same object at a different time period .    in the case of fe",
    "k@xmath1 variability @xcite used the spot model to explain the variability of the iron line profile of mrk 766 in the x - ray band .",
    "also , @xcite studied variations of the iron line due to an orbiting spot which arise by reflection on the surface of an accretion disk , following its illumination by an x - ray flare in form of an off - axis point - like source just above the accretion disk . besides the spots in accretion disk , the fe k@xmath1 line of some agn could be also significantly affected by highly - ionized fast accretion disk outflows . for instance",
    ", @xcite found that the major features in the observed 2  10 kev spectrum of the bright quasar pg1211 + 143 can be well reproduced by their monte carlo radiative transfer simulations which include a variety of disk wind ( outflow ) models .    to explain the short - timescale variability of the dp line profiles @xcite constructed stochastically perturbed accretion disk models and calculated h@xmath1 line profile series as the bright spots rotate , shear and decay .",
    "they ruled out spot production by star / disk collisions and favor a scenario where the radius of marginal self - gravity is within the line emitting region , creating a sharp increase in the radial spot distribution in the outer parts .",

    "in order to test how this model of bright spot affects the h@xmath0 line profile , we performed several numerical simulations of perturbed emission of an accretion disk in kerr metric for different positions of bright spot along @xmath27 and @xmath28-axes in both , positive and negative directions . for these simulations we adopted the following parameters of the disk : inclination @xmath29 ,",

    "the other wing and the line core stay nearly constant , and therefore almost unaffected by bright spot .",
    "the situation is quite opposite when the bright spot moves in both directions along the @xmath28-axis , because then it affects only the line core , while the both of its wings stay almost intact ( see the bottom panels of fig .",

    "+             we also performed the corresponding simulations for different positions of a bright spot which moves from the inner radius of the accretion disk towards its outer parts along the @xmath35 direction , and found similar behavior of the simulated line profiles ( see fig .",

    "the latter result should be taken with caution because the observations from 1999 were performed after a large gap of @xmath59 1 year .",
    "therefore , the displacements of the perturbing regions can not be considered as indisputably confirmed , but on the contrary , their widths almost certainly vary with time .",
    "the last conclusion is valid for both , moving and stationary perturbing regions , since neither of them can provide satisfactory fits with fixed widths .",
    "the obtained best fit positions of both , moving and stationary perturbations are located on the approaching side of the accretion disk ( see fig .",

    "therefore , in the case of 3c 390.3 , this mechanism still can not be neither ruled out , nor accepted .",
    "disk - star collisions are assumed to be very frequent events which happen on daily timescales and which could increase disk surface temperature in the region of collision , and thus , create a bright spot .",
    "such bright spots shear with differential rotation of the disk and decay as the material cools down . however , the typical size of a such bright spot immediately after collision is close to the size of the star , which is very small when expressed in gravitational radii . therefore ,",
    "neither this mechanism could be accepted as a potential cause of two bright spots , detected in the case of quasar 3c 390.3 .",
    "the tidal disruption of stars by central black hole ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) happens when a star passes the tidal radius of the black hole , i.e. when the black hole s tidal gravity exceeds the star s self - gravity .",
    "gas of a disrupted star falls back to the black hole at a super - eddington rate , releasing a flare of energy which then blows away a significant fraction of the falling gas as an outflow . such super - eddington flares and outflows could induce instabilities in accretion disk in form of bright spots .",
    "however , this mechanism is an unlikely candidate for a potential cause of the bright spots in the case of 3c 390.3 due to the following weaknesses : ( i ) super - eddington outflows are short living ( @xmath62 days ) ; ( ii ) frequency of star disruptions in a typical elliptical galaxy is very low , between @xmath63 and @xmath64 per year , and in the case of the black hole of 3c 390.3 which mass is @xmath65 @xcite , it is near the low end of this range ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( iii ) any stellar debris could be hardly released in the case of 3c 390.3 since the main sequence stars are disrupted within the innermost stable orbit around a non - rotating black hole as massive as that in 3c 390.3 ; ( iv ) it is unclear how the bright spots produced by this mechanism should evolve with time .",
    "spiral arms in agn disks could be formed spontaneously due to self - gravity instabilities ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) or could be triggered by close passage of some massive object such as another supermassive black hole or a star cluster ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "spiral arms increase flux variability of agn on timescales of a year to several years , but as noted before , they are unable to reproduce all aspects of the observed variability . however , they are also subjected to fragmentation , causing small variations in the flux on timescales of several months .",
    "the fragments in spiral arms can be due to sub - structures in a non - uniform accretion disk , such as isolated clumps which could pass through the arm and dominate in its emissivity , causing the discrete `` lumps '' of excess emission @xcite . the observed variability on timescales from few months to several years in the difference spectra of some agn is probably caused by such lumps .",
    "it is quite possible that some of these lumps are long - living and that they do not vary significantly in strength , shape , or position over a period of several years @xcite . as the obtained results show , it is the same case with the large bright spots which are responsible for amplitude outbursts of the 3c 390.3 h@xmath0 line , because they have constant emissivity and they are either stationary or spiralling over small distances during the period of several years .",
    "the only feature which significantly varies with time is their width .",
    "therefore , these bright spots could be most likely explained by the emissivity lumps , caused by fragments in spiral arms of the accretion disk .",
    "we developed a model of the disk perturbing region in the form of a single bright spot ( or flare ) by a modification of the power law disk emissivity and used this model to simulate the disk line profiles .",
    "this model has been used to fit the observed h@xmath0 line of 3c 390.3 observed from 1995 to 1999 . from this investigation",
    "we can point out the following results :    1 .",
    "the model which includes perturbation ( bright spot ) in the accretion disk can successfully explain difference in double peaked line profiles , as e.g. higher red peak even if we have the standard circular disk .",
    "the position of a bright spot has a stronger influence on one particular part of spectral line profiles ( such as e.g. its core if the spot is in the central part of the disk , or `` red '' and `` blue '' wings if the spot is located on receding and approaching part , respectively ) .",
    "using the model for perturbing region we were able to successfully model and reproduce the observed variations of the h@xmath0 line profile in the case of 3c 390.3 , including the two large amplitude outbursts observed during the analyzed period .",
    "therefore , the observed variations of the 3c 390.3 h@xmath0 line could be caused by perturbations in the disk emissivity .",
    "we found that two outbursts referred by @xcite could be explained by successive occurrences of two different bright spots on approaching side of the disk which are either moving , originating in the inner regions of the disk and spiralling outwards , or stationary . both bright spots decay by time until they completely disappear .",
    "our results support hypothesis that the perturbations in accretion disk emissivity are probably caused by fragments in the spiral arms of the disk .",
    "the results presented above show that a circular disk with perturbations ( bright spots ) can be applied to explain different double peaked line profiles , and can be also used to trace perturbations ( as well as their characteristics ) from the broad double peaked line shapes .",
