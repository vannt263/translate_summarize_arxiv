    "the highest redshift quasar known at the present time , at @xmath7 , is the first one to show a complete gunn - peterson trough ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "this suggests that the reionization of hydrogen was probably completed near the epoch @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is not yet completely certain because an ionized medium can produce a complete gunn - peterson trough if the neutral fraction is everywhere high enough ( owing to a low intensity of the ionizing background ) .",
    "however , the abrupt change with redshift near @xmath2 of the fraction of transmitted flux in the ly@xmath0  region of the spectrum ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ) implies a rapid increase of the mean free path of ionizing photons with time ( fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , at least in the region of the line of sight to the @xmath7 qso , just as expected when the last low - density regions of the intergalactic medium are ionized ( e.g. , gnedin 2000 ) .",
    "ending reionization by @xmath2 requires that at least one ionizing photon has been emitted to the intergalactic medium for each baryon in the universe , in addition to the amount needed to compensate for any recombinations that have taken place .",
    "this implies that the emissivity of ionizing photons ( defined as the mean number of photons emitted per unit time and volume ) should be greater than the mean number density of baryons divided by the age of the universe at @xmath8 , unless the emissivity had declined rapidly with time at @xmath9 .",
    "it is possible to infer the emissivity at lower redshift , by using the intensity of the ionizing background measured from the mean transmitted flux in the ly@xmath0  forest , and the mean free path of ionizing photons determined from the observed abundance of lyman limit systems .",
    "the first of these two quantities , the intensity of the ionizing background , can be measured in the context of the present theoretical understanding of the ly@xmath0  forest as arising from a photoionized intergalactic medium that follows the gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuations ( see the review by rauch 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the observed mean transmitted flux can then be used to infer the ly@xmath0  scattering optical depth at the mean hydrogen density and in hubble expansion , @xmath10 : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the hydrogen neutral fraction at mean density , @xmath13 is the gas temperature in units of @xmath14 k , and @xmath15 is the photoionization rate due to the cosmic background in units of @xmath16 . when the value of @xmath17 was still highly uncertain , the value of @xmath10 inferred from observations of the mean transmitted flux , @xmath18 at @xmath19 ( see rauch et al .",
    "1997 , and table 2 in mcdonald et al .",
    "2000 ) implied a lower limit to the value of @xmath17 given by the lower limit on @xmath15 that was inferred from the observed qsos .",
    "now , @xmath17 has been more accurately measured from the primordial deuterium abundance ( omeara et al .",
    "2001 ) and the cmb spectrum of fluctuations ( de bernardis et al .  2002 ;",
    "pryke et al .  2002 ; spergel et al .  2003 ) , and we can use the value of @xmath20 determined from the ly@xmath0  forest to constrain the intensity of the ionizing background and its evolution with redshift .    the mean free path of ionizing photons is related to the abundance of lyman limit systems , which have column densities @xmath21 .",
    "the reason is that the column density distribution of absorption systems is approximately of the form @xmath22 ( e.g. , petitjean et al .",
    "1993 ) , so the average rate of absorption is dominated by high column densities , up to the column density at which the absorption systems become optically thick .",
    "the abundance of lyman limit systems has been reasonably well measured up to redshift @xmath1 . in this paper , we combine the measurements of the intensity and the mean free path of ionizing photons to infer their rate of emission at @xmath1 (  2 ) .",
    "we then compare this emissivity to the observations of known sources at this redshift (  3 ) .",
    "then , in  4 , we find the consequences for the evolution of the emissivity at higher redshift to satisfy the requirement of reionizing the igm by @xmath2 . finally , in  5 the consequences for the thomson optical depth of the cosmic microwave background photons are discussed .",
    "we will use the flat cosmological model with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "in this section we evaluate the emissivity of ionizing radiation at redshift @xmath1 . in terms of the photoionization rate , @xmath26 , and",
    "the mean free path of the ionizing photons , @xmath27 , the photon emissivity is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a frequency - averaged cross section .",
    "the result we will find in this paper is that the emissivity at @xmath1 has a rather small value , implying that it must not have declined much with redshift , up to a substantially earlier epoch at @xmath30 , in order to satisfy the requirement that reionization was completed by @xmath31 . with that in mind",
    ", we will evaluate the maximum allowed value of @xmath26 and of @xmath32 at @xmath1 , which is the highest redshift at which the mean free path @xmath27 has been observationally determined .",
    "the most recent measurements of the mean transmitted flux through the ly@xmath0  forest , @xmath33 , were reported by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , from a large sample of qsos of the sloan digital sky survey . from their fig.4 , the effective optical depth [ defined as @xmath34 at @xmath1 is @xmath35 , where we have estimated the error from the errorbars and scatter of their measured points at various redshift bins . hence , @xmath36 at @xmath1 .",
    "note that previous values of @xmath33 from a small sample of high resolution spectra ( schaye et al .",
    "2000 , mcdonald et al .",
    "2000 ) were higher , but this was probably because their method underestimated the qso continuum flux , which becomes increasingly difficult to set by fitting regions between absorption lines as the redshift increases .",
    "we now use the results of mcdonald & miralda - escud ( 2001 , hereafter mm01 ) to infer the photoinization rate @xmath15 . according to their figure 2",
    ", the value @xmath36 implies a photoionization rate of @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "this value needs to be corrected from the model used in mm01 to the model we use here , and to @xmath1 , where we will choose all the parameters to maximize @xmath15 , and therefore infer an upper limit .",
    "first of all , the relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath10 in equation ( 1 ) depends on the amplitude of the mass power spectrum at the jeans scale of the ly@xmath0  forest : a lower amplitude of fluctuations implies that the gas is less concentrated in collapsed regions that correspond to saturated absorption lines , and a greater fraction of the gas is left in low - density regions , where it contributes more efficiently to decrease the mean transmitted flux .",
    "the measured amplitude of the power spectrum of the ly@xmath0  forest ( see croft et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) is @xmath39 times lower than the amplitude in the model that was used by mm01 ( as shown in mcdonald et al .",
    "2000 ) , which had the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the power spectrum . in other words ,",
    "the model used by mm01 would match the ly@xmath0  forest power spectrum amplitude found by croft et al .  if its normalization had been changed to @xmath42 , leaving all other parameters unchanged .",
    "since the amplitude of mass fluctuations grows proportionally to the scale factor @xmath43 ( the effects of the vacuum energy and the radiation are negligible at @xmath1 ) , the model with normalization @xmath44 has the same relation of @xmath33 and @xmath10 at @xmath1 as the model with normalization @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "it was also found in mm01 that the value of @xmath10 inferred from a fixed @xmath33 depends on the amplitude approximately as @xmath47 ( this can in fact be checked by comparing the values of @xmath15 at @xmath38 and @xmath48 for fixed @xmath33 in fig . 2 of mm01 ) .",
    "because the limit @xmath49 was derived at @xmath38 , and @xmath50 , the power spectrum amplitude correction is a factor @xmath51 .",
    "we note that here we have taken the central measured value of croft et al .  of the power spectrum normalization , instead of a lower value within their errorbar ( which would further raise the upper limit to @xmath15 by about 20% ) , because other measurements of the power spectrum amplitude favor a higher value instead ( see seljak 2001 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2001 ; croft et al .  2002 ; jarvis et al .",
    "2002 ; spergel et al .  2003 ) .",
    "second , the inferred @xmath15 depends on the gas temperature .",
    "mm01 assumed @xmath52 , but measurements of the gas temperature from the ly@xmath0  forest spectra have given values in the range @xmath53 ( theuns et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "although the optical depth of a uniform medium is proportional to @xmath54 ( eq .",
    "1 ) because of the temperature dependence of the recombination coefficient , the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath10 is also affected by the temperature because thermal broadening spreads some of the absorption from saturated spectral regions to other regions with less absorption .",
    "we use the result found in mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2001 , their  7.4 ) that thermal broadening causes a change in @xmath10 of 27% of that due to the recombination coefficient , in the opposite direction , therefore giving an effective dependence @xmath55 .",
    "if we assume the lowest value of the temperature among the reported measurements , @xmath56 , then the temperature correction for the upper limit of @xmath15 is @xmath57 .    finally , we correct for all other parameters used in mm01 ( @xmath58 , @xmath24 , @xmath59 , @xmath38 ) to the ones used here ( @xmath25 , @xmath24 , @xmath60 , @xmath1 ) , which we choose within the current uncertainties to maximize the inferred @xmath15 .",
    "the result of all these corrections ( see eq .  1 ) for the upper limit to @xmath15 at @xmath1 is @xmath61      storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that the rate of lyman limit systems ( defined as absorption systems with column density @xmath62 ) at @xmath1 is @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , the mean spacing between lyman limit systems is @xmath64 at @xmath1 . to find",
    "the relationship of @xmath65 to the mean free path of ionizing photons , we assume that the column density distribution of the absorbers is @xmath66 ( petitjean et al .",
    "the absorption probability per unit length , @xmath67 , for a photon at the hydrogen ionization edge frequency @xmath68 , is @xmath69 where @xmath70 . at a higher frequency @xmath71 , and",
    "approximating the photoionization cross section as proportional to @xmath72 , the mean free path is increased to @xmath73 .",
    "we note here that our mean free path in ( [ mfp0 ] ) is 1.5 times longer than that adopted in madau , haardt , & rees ( 1999 ) , and in schirber & bullock ( 2002 ) .",
    "for some reason , their opacity corresponds to a lyman limit system abundance of 5 per unit redshift , larger than reported by storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the photoionization rate is related to the emissivity @xmath74 , the cross section @xmath75 , and the mean free path as a function of frequency by @xmath76 here , we use the approximation that the mean free path is much less than the horizon distance ( the exact relation between the emissivity and background intensity involves an integration over time with redshift effects , a full knowledge of the spectrum , and reemission ; see miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ; haardt & madau 1996 ; fardal , giroux , & shull 1998 .",
    "we treat reemission approximately in  2.4 ) . assuming that @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the emissivity per unit frequency at the ionization edge .",
    "the emissivity integrated over frequency is @xmath83 .",
    "the emissivity can be conveniently expressed as the number of ionizing photons emitted per hubble time and for each atom in the universe : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the comoving number density of atoms ( adding hydrogen and helium ) , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the hubble constant at @xmath1 . using @xmath88 , taking the lower limit for the mean free path ( to obtain an upper limit for the emissivity ) , and assuming @xmath89 , the final result is @xmath90 in other words , there are fewer than eight ionizing photons being emitted per hubble time and for each atom at @xmath1 .",
    "some of the photons that contribute to the photoionization rate in the intergalactic medium arise from reemission by the ly@xmath0  absorption systems ( see haardt & madau 1996 ) . for every hydrogen atom that is photoionized by absorbing a photon , and assuming ionization equilibrium , a recombination will take place , and about 40% of the recombinations are direct to the ground state , producing another ionizing photon .",
    "however , the majority of the ionizing photons that are not very close to the hydrogen ionization edge are absorbed deep within lyman limit systems , and the photons produced by recombinations in these regions are close to the ionization edge [ with a typical frequency separation from the lyman limit of @xmath91 and not likely to escape from the lyman limit system .",
    "because of this , reemission by hydrogen recombination increases the background intensity by only @xmath92 ( as is found , for example , by using the approximation that the reemitted photons escape only when produced in an absorber of column density @xmath93 , which is the column density for which the typical optical depth for the photon to escape is unity )",
    ".    some photons are also emitted by helium recombinations .",
    "makes little difference to the total budget of ionizing photons , because for each absorption by , one photon that ionizes hydrogen is produced by the subsequent recombination .",
    "because we did not include absorption by in our previous estimate of the mean free path , we do not include the reemission either .",
    "finally , photons with energy above @xmath94 rydbergs are mostly used to photoionize , and each recombination can produce between one and three photons capable of ionizing hydrogen . about 25% of the recombinations that are not direct to the ground state go to @xmath95 , producing a balmer continuum photon , which can ionize hydrogen .",
    "in addition , all the recombinations produce either a lyman series photon , or two continuum photons when the last transition is from 2s to 1s ; in @xmath96 of the recombinations , two continuum photons that can both ionize hydrogen are produced ( see osterbrock 1989 , tables 2.8 , 4.11 , and 4.12 ) . hence , on average 1.33 ionizing photons are produced for each that is photoionized . for a source spectrum @xmath97 , with @xmath98 ,",
    "the fraction of photons used to ionize is @xmath99 , so reemission increases the emissivity by a factor @xmath100 .",
    "this factor can be reduced during the reionization , when the rate of recombinations is less than the rate of photoionizations .",
    "based on this discussion of the effect of reemission from absorbers , we reduce our upper limit in ( [ emisi ] ) for the total emissivity @xmath32 by a factor @xmath101 , to obtain the upper limit for the direct emissivity from sources @xmath102 at @xmath1 ( rounded up to one digit given the various uncertainties discussed ) , @xmath103",
    "fan et al .  ( 2001 ) measured the following qso luminosity function at high redshift ( @xmath104 ) from sdss : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the luminosity of a qso with absolute ab magnitude @xmath107 at @xmath108 , and @xmath109 . using a power - law spectral index @xmath110 for the qso spectrum at @xmath111 ( telfer et al .",

    ", we must require @xmath127 .",
    "we note , however , that low - luminosity qsos may be intrinsically self - absorbed at the lyman limit , reducing their contribution to the ionizing emissivity ( see alam & miralda - escud 2002 ) .",

    "[ [ lfun ] ] ) , qsos would contribute about half of the total emissivity required at @xmath1 from equation ( [ emiss ] ) .",
    "there are also limits from the hubble deep field ( conti et al .",
    "1999 ) , but these probe qsos at much lower luminosities and do not provide a stronger constraint on @xmath133 . in summary , the available observations are consistent with a contribution to the ionizing emissivity from qsos that does not exceed the upper limit in ( [ emiss ] ) .      the galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function at high redshift has been measured by steidel et al .",
    "they fit the luminosity function to a schechter function , @xmath135 after converting to the flat cosmological model with @xmath60 , @xmath24 , the parameters they find are @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 at @xmath139 . to convert this to the ionizing luminosity",

    "the form of the galaxy luminosity function ( [ gflum ] ) is highly uncertain at @xmath146 , because the observations of steidel et al .",

    "the hubble deep field counts at @xmath1 are significantly below the prediction from the model in equation ( [ gflum ] ) , but this may be due to galaxy clustering ( steidel et al .  1999 ; see their fig .  8) .",

    "if this result were true , the luminous galaxies with @xmath150 would already produce the maximum emissivity in equation ( [ emiss ] ) .",

    "more accurate determinations of the escape fraction , the abundance of lyman limit systems , and the inferred photoionization rate from the ly@xmath0  forest transmitted flux will be needed to resolve this question .",
    "the highest redshift qso known at the present time ( becker et al .  2001 ) shows a complete gunn - peterson trough at @xmath31 , but the spectra of all the sources at lower redshift have detectable transmitted flux blueward of ly@xmath0  , indicating that most of the volume in the intergalactic medium had to be reionized by @xmath2 .",
    "we now address the contraint implied by this fact on the evolution of the ionizing emissivity , in view of its value at @xmath1 ( eq .  [ emiss ] ) .",
    "reionization proceeds by the creation of ionized regions around individual sources ( arons & wingert 1972 ) .",
    "the mean free path of ionizing photons through the neutral medium is typically very short compared to the distance between sources , so reionization proceeds by the growth of the ionized regions and can be modeled in terms of the fraction of the volume that is ionized at time @xmath153 , @xmath154 , assuming that the remaining fraction @xmath155 is completely neutral . moreover , because the emitted photons are used to ionize atoms almost immediately after their emission , it follows that the change in the fraction of atoms that are ionized in the universe is equal to the ionizing photon emission rate per atom minus the average recombination rate of atoms .",

    "it is also identical to the equation of radiative transfer , where @xmath163 plays the role of the intensity , and @xmath164 and @xmath165 play the role of the absorption and emission coefficients , respectively .",
    "the solution is found through the substitutions @xmath166 , and @xmath167 : @xmath168 where @xmath169 , and @xmath170 is the initial time when the first sources turn on . assuming that any clumping factor is constant , and that @xmath171 [ e.g. , for the cosmological constant model with a present matter density @xmath172 , we have @xmath173 , the recombination rate varies as @xmath174 . choosing @xmath175 as a fiducial time , and @xmath176",

    "the subscript @xmath180 is used here to denote that the average is to be taken only over those regions of space where matter is predominantly photoionized by photons that have escaped to the intergalactic medium .",
    "this restriction is necessary because if we did not impose it , the clumping factor would be dominated by regions of dense gas that are locally ionized by sources that were not included in the emissivity in equation ( [ emisi ] ) , precisely because the radiation from these sources is locally absorbed . in fact , in the absence of any restriction on the regions over which one must average to obtain the clumping factor of ionized matter , then the clumping factor would obviously be very large and dominated by the densest stars .",
    "once stars are eliminated from consideration , there are still regions that form in dense clouds in the interstellar medium of galaxies around massive young stars , in which all the emitted photons are immediately absorbed locally .",
    "this emission is irrelevant for the reionization of the intergalactic medium , and it is best not to include in equation ( [ emisi ] ) , and at the same time not to include the dense gas ionized locally in the clumping factor .",
    "this definition of the clumping factor inevitably involves an arbitrary choice in defining when a photon is considered to be escaped , and therefore when a region is predominantly ionized by escaped photons rather than local ones . in practice",
    ", a photon can be defined to have escaped once it reaches an intergalactic region with gas density below some critical value .",
    "the calculation of the clumping factor can only be obtained from full radiative transfer simulations of reionization , but its value can differ among studies by large factors depending on the definition that is adopted ( see gnedin 2000 and references therein ) . if the restriction that escaped photons dominate the radiation intensity is not imposed , then very large values of the clumping factor can be obtained , which could only be used consistently by including the locally absorbed photons in the emissivity .    here",
    ", we use the simple model of miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the clumping factor , which uses the approximation that the gas is ionized only up to an overdensity @xmath181 , and all the gas at higher densities is neutral , or otherwise is ionized locally and therefore does not contribute to the clumping factor .",

    "it has been pointed out by haiman , abel , & madau ( 2001 ) that before reionization is complete , a large number of low - mass halos should be present and should contain dense gas accreted before it was heated by reionization .",
    "the effect of these low - mass halos would be to decrease the mean free path at a fixed overdensity @xmath182 , and to widen the distribution of the overdensity . to estimate the plausible change in the clumping factor due to these low - mass halos",
    ", we can assume that the structure of the atomic intergalactic medium before reionization is self - similar to that of the ionized intergalactic medium , but with the scales reduced in proportion to the jeans scale @xmath186 , so that the clumping factor should depend only on the ratio @xmath187 , and the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuations at the jeans scale .",

    "the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations in cold dark matter with @xmath60 and @xmath24 increases by a factor @xmath192 between the scales of @xmath193 to @xmath194 mpc ( roughly corresponding to the jeans scales at these two temperatures ) . therefore ,",
    "the clumping factor of a medium in which all the low - mass halos formed from scales intermediate between the jeans scales of the atomic and ionized medium have survived , at @xmath195 and @xmath196 , should be the same as the clumping factor of a medium with no such surviving halos , evaluated at @xmath19 and @xmath197 . from figures 2b and 6 of miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we find this clumping factor to be 7 .",
    "we note that this is an upper limit to the true clumping factor , because the gas in the low - mass halos that might increase the clumping factor above the value of @xmath198 found previously is likely to evaporate on a time short compared to the hubble time , once these halos have been reached by an ionization front ( shapiro & raga 2001 ) . the gas may also be expelled by a small amount of internal star formation even before the halo is reached by external ionizing radiation .",
    "finally , a discussion is needed to decide if the case a or case b recombination coefficient should be used .",
    "ionizing photons of frequency @xmath71 will typically be absorbed in regions of column density @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the lyman limit frequency .",

    "most of the photons emitted by direct recombinations to the ground state , which have frequencies very close to the lyman limit , will therefore be produced in high column density systems and will be reabsorbed within the same system ( in addition , among the small fraction of photons from direct recombinations to the ground state that escape the system in which they have been produced , some will be redshifted below the lyman limit and will not be absorbed again ) .",
    "hence , these photons do not contribute to increase the cosmic ionizing background intensity for the most part . an alternative way to understand",
    "this argument is that , even though in principle we are in a case b situation because the recombination photons are reabsorbed , in practice the inclusion of the photons from recombinations increases the clumping factor by the ratio of the case a to case b recombination coefficients because these photons increase the ionization in dense regions , therefore yielding a recombination rate equivalent to using case a. therefore , we use the case a recombination coefficient .",
    "we now compute @xmath154 assuming models where the emissivity varies as @xmath201 for @xmath202 , and has the value @xmath203 at @xmath1 , i.e. , the maximum allowed value found previously ( eq .  [ emiss ] ) .",
    "we choose the recombination coefficient @xmath204 , valid for case a and @xmath205 k , and electron density @xmath206 at @xmath2 , valid for @xmath25 and if helium is only once ionized .",
    "this yields a recombination rate per hubble time @xmath207 . in some cases",
    ", we increase this recombination rate by a clumping factor @xmath208 .",
    "we fix the fraction of baryons in the ionized regions that actually need to be ionized to @xmath209 ( independent of redshift ) , in reasonable agreement with the fraction of baryons that seem to be present in damped ly@xmath0  systems at @xmath210 ( lanzetta et al .  1991 ; storrie - lombardi et al .  1996 ) , and the fraction of baryons above the critical overdensity @xmath185 at @xmath2 in the model discussed above for the clumping factor ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "2000 , fig .",
    "we solve equation ( [ reisol ] ) , starting at @xmath211 at some initial redshift @xmath212 when the emissivity is assumed to turn on suddenly .",
    "the parameters of the model that we vary are @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath208 , and we require all models to reach @xmath214 ( i.e. , the end of reionization ) at @xmath2 .    the results of five representative models are shown in figure 1 .",
    "when @xmath215 , assuming the emissivity to remain constant satisfies the requirement of completing reionization by @xmath2 when the emissivity is turned on at @xmath216 . with only a slight decline of the emissivity",
    ", the initial redshift needs to be pushed to much higher values . for @xmath217 , which corresponds to a decline of the comoving emissivity by a factor of only @xmath218 between @xmath1 and @xmath219",
    ", the sources need to start at very high redshift to reach @xmath214 at @xmath2 .",
    "naturally , changes in the emissivity at redshifts higher than @xmath220 are irrelevant for the requirement that reionization ends at @xmath2 , because most of the atoms ionized at this high redshift will recombine again .",
    "we therefore conclude that , for the case of no clumping , _ the ionizing emissivity at @xmath221 can not be much lower than its maximum value allowed at @xmath1_. in other words , the sources responsible for the emission of ionizing radiation can not decrease their overall comoving emissivity by more than a factor @xmath218 between @xmath1 and @xmath219 .",
    "allowing now for a clumping factor , an increase to @xmath222 already requires the model with constant emissivity ( @xmath223 ) to maintain the emissivity up to a very high initial redshift . a model where the same amount of radiative energy is emitted at every hubble time [ i.e. , @xmath224 , since @xmath225 , starting at very high @xmath212 , results in complete reionization at @xmath2 when @xmath226 .",
    "therefore , for a clumping factor as large as @xmath227 , as suggested previously for a model where the ionized gas in all low - mass halos is retained , the emissivity would need to substantially increase with redshift .",
    "we have shown that by combining the measurement of the ionizing emissivity @xmath32 at @xmath1 with the requirement that the reionization must end by @xmath2 , we can infer that the emissivity does not decrease with redshift by more than a factor @xmath218 from @xmath1 to @xmath219 .",
    "we can now ask how this evolutionary constraint compares to the evolution at @xmath228 that is implied by observations of the ly@xmath0  forest decrement and the mean free path between lyman limit systems . from mcdonald & miralda - escud ( 2001 ) , the photoionization rate ( or proper intensity of the background ) declines roughly as @xmath229 from @xmath230 to @xmath1 .",
    "the abundance of lyman limit systems per unit redshift is proportional to @xmath231 ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1994 ) , implying that the proper mean free path varies as @xmath232 .",
    "hence , the comoving emissivity evolves as @xmath233 , essentially constant within the likely errors of measurement for both the proper intensity and mean free path evolution .",
    "therefore , the results of  4.3 show that if the clumping factor is low , this constant emissivity needs to roughly maintained at the same value up to @xmath234 , while if the clumping factor is much larger than one , the emissivity needs to modify its evolution and increase strongly with redshift at @xmath202 .",
    "the optical depth of cosmic microwave background photons to electron scattering , @xmath235 , is given by @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the thomson cross section for electron scattering .",
    "the values of @xmath235 for the five models in figure 1 are indicated in the figure .",
    "we have assumed @xmath209 at all redshifts ; the 10% of the matter not included is supposed to be either gas that remains atomic or molecular in self - shielded regions , or stars .",
    "these results show that the minimum allowed value of @xmath235 , which occurs for models where the emissivity turns on at a redshift not much larger than 6 , is @xmath238 .",
    "the maximum values of the optical depth depend on the emissivity at high redshift .",
    "if the emissivity does not increase with redshift , then the ionized fraction of the volume at high redshift needs to be small due to the fast rate of recombinations ( i.e. , for constant emissivity , @xmath239 , and the integral in eq .  [ [ taues ] ] converges rapidly at high @xmath240 ) . for a model with a constant emissivity up to @xmath241 and clumping factor equal to one , the optical depth can be increased only up to @xmath242 ( in this model , reionization ends at @xmath243 , but the reionization end could always be delayed by increasing the clumping factor as the fraction @xmath159 reaches a value close to unity ) .",
    "an emissivity increasing with redshift can obviously produce larger optical depths , and as mentioned before the value of the emissivity at @xmath244 does not affect the epoch at which reionization ends , so in principle the optical depth could be arbitrarily high if enough ionizing sources were present at very high redshift .",
    "however , in the flat cold dark matter model with @xmath23 , which is strongly supported by all observations of large - scale structure , the first stars form only at @xmath245 from @xmath246 peaks collapsing into the first low - mass halos ( e.g. , couchman & rees 1986 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2000 ; ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2002 ; venkatessan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ) , and so the emissivity can not continue to increase up to a very high redshift . at the same time , observations indicate a cosmic star formation rate in galaxies that starts to decline with redshift at @xmath247 ( madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) , although the ionizing emissivity might increase with redshift even when the star formation rate decreases because of an increasing escape fraction for ionizing photons .",
    "as this paper was being refereed , the results of the wmap mission were announced .",
    "kogut et al .",
    "( 2003 ) give a result @xmath248 from a model - independent analysis , although the result and the error can change when fitted to different cdm models ( spergel et al .",
    "the value of @xmath249 implied by a constant emissivity with clumping factor of one up to very high redshift would represent a @xmath250 deviation from the value of kogut et al .",
    "a value as high as @xmath251 would clearly imply a substantial increase of the emissivity up to @xmath252 , when only a small fraction of the mass has collapsed into halos that can form stars in the cdm model .",
    "the observed mean transmitted flux of the ly@xmath0  forest , when combined with independently measured values of the mean baryon density , the amplitude of the power spectrum , and the gas temperature , yields a measurement of the intensity of the ionizing background .",
    "the abundance of lyman limit systems determines the mean free path of ionizing photons .",
    "these two quantities together determine the ionizing emissivity .",
    "we have argued in this paper that the emissivity measured in this way at @xmath1 is at most 7 ionizing photons per atom per hubble time .",
    "we have then shown that the emissivity over the redshift range @xmath253 can not be much lower than the value at @xmath1 in order that the universe can be reionized by @xmath2 , if the clumping factor of ionized gas during the reionization epoch is close to unity .",
    "if the clumping factor is larger than unity , then the ionizing emissivity must increase with redshift between @xmath1 and @xmath234 .",
    "the electron scattering optical depth must be at least @xmath254 , given the presence of ionized intergalactic gas at @xmath255 , and a reasonable minimum redshift range over which sources ionize the universe at @xmath30 .",
    "if the emissivity of ionizing photons does not increase with redshift at @xmath202 , then the optical depth must be less than @xmath256 .",
    "measurements of the optical depth from the cmb spectrum of temperature and polarization fluctuations therefore provide a powerful diagnostic to decide if the peak of the comoving ionizing emissivity occurred at @xmath257 ( with a broad plateau extending up to @xmath234 so that the end of reionization can be reached by @xmath2 ) , or at a much earlier epoch .",
    "the recent wmap result has an error that is still too large to reach a definite conclusion , but if a value @xmath258 is confirmed it implies that the comoving emissivity continues to rise up to @xmath245 .",
