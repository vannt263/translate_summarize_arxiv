    "in recent years evidences have been obtained for a relatively fast magnetic field decay in neutron stars undergoing accretion in binary systems ( see , e.g. , taam & van den heuvel 1986 , bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "the weak surface magnetic fields of many binary radiopulsars ( @xmath1 g ) , for which an efficient accretion has taken place , strongly suggest the idea of the accretion induced magnetic field decay in these neutron stars .",
    "most of the low - magnetic - field pulsars are believed to be old neutron stars experienced a mass transfer in low - mass binaries where accretion ensues due to roche - lobe overflow and may last relatively long .",
    "recently geppert & urpin ( 1994 ) and urpin & geppert ( 1995 ) have suggested a simple and efficient mechanism of a rapid field decay in neutron stars undergoing accretion .",
    "accretion changes drastically the thermal evolution of the neutron star if the accretion rate is sufficiently high and a mass transfer lasts a sufficiently long time ( see , e.g. , fujimoto et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the energy release due to accretion heats the neutron star and reduces the crustal conductivity since the latter depends on the temperature .",
    "a decrease of the conductivity accelerates the ohmic decay of the magnetic field if this field is maintained by currents in the crust .",
    "if the mass transfer phase lasts as long as @xmath2 yr the surface field strength can be reduced by a factor @xmath3 depending on the magnetic configuration at the beginning of the accretion phase .",
    "accretion influences not only the field decay but the spin evolution of pulsars as well , and the strength of the magnetic field is one of the dominating factors that determines this evolution .",
    "if the total amount of the accreted matter is large enough ( @xmath4 ) , the neutron star in a low - mass binary can be `` recycled '' to millisecond periods ( alpar et al .",
    "1982 ) .",
    "the accretion phase , however , does not exhaust all possible stages in the evolution of neutron stars entering low - mass binary systems .",
    "the evolution of such systems is extremely long since even the main - sequence lifetime of a low - mass companion exceeds @xmath5 yr . in accordance with the standard scenario ,",
    "the neutron star in a close binary can pass throughout several evolutionary phases ( see , e.g. , pringle & rees 1972 , illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) :    \\1 ) the initial obscured radio pulsar phase in which the pressure of the pulsar radiation is sufficient to keep plasma of the companion stellar wind away from the neutron star magnetosphere ; the radio emission of the pulsar is partly ( or completely ) absorbed by the plasma cloud surrounding the binary system thus the pulsar is practically unobservable ; the pulsars spins down due to the magnetodipole radiation ;    \\2 ) the propeller phase in which the radiation pressure reduced due to the field decay and spin down can not prevent the infalling matter from an interaction with the magnetosphere but the spin rotation is sufficiently rapid yet to eject the wind matter due to the centrifugal force and to transfer the angular momentum from the neutron star to the wind matter ;    \\3 ) the wind accretion phase in which the matter from the wind falls on to the surface of the neutron star ; nuclear burning of the accreted material heats the neutron star and causes the accretion - driven field decay ; in the course of this phase the neutron star can slightly spin up since the accreted matter carries a certain amount of the angular momentum ;",
    "\\4 ) the enhanced accretion phase which starts when the secondary star leaves the main - sequence and fills its roche - lobe ; a heavy mass transfer on to the neutron star heats the interior to a very high temperature @xmath6k ( fujimoto et al . 1984 , miralda - escude et al . 1990 ) and accelerates the accretion - driven field decay ; a steady keplerian disc is formed by the accretion flow outside the neutron star magnetosphere and the accretion torque spins up the neutron star to a very short period .",
    "the neutron star processed in the above evolutionary picture can probably prolong its life as a radiopulsar with relatively low magnetic field and short spin period after accretion due to roche - lobe overflow is exhausted .",
    "the properties of pulsars produced due to evolution in low - mass binaries have not been analysed in detail yet and we address this problem in the present paper .",
    "note that a similar problem has been considered by jahan miri & bhattacharia ( 1994 ) who assumed that the magnetic evolution is determined by the expulsion of the field lines from the neutron star core due to interaction between the fluxoids in the proton superconductor and the vortices in the neutron superfluid .",
    "the authors , however , restricted themselves to the case of wide low - mass binaries and considered the evolution only during the main - sequence life time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe in detail the adopted model in section 2 .",
    "the results of calculations are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we discuss our results and compare them with the available observational data on the evolution of neutron stars in low - mass binaries .",
    "we consider the evolution of the neutron star in a binary system with the secondary being a low - mass star .",
    "the binary is assumed to be relatively close thus the companion can fill the roche lobe after the end of its main - sequence life .",
    "both the magnetic and spin evolution of the neutron star may be strongly influenced by accretion from the companion . during its main - sequence evolution ( which lasts as long as @xmath7 yr ) , the secondary loses mass due to the stellar wind and a certain fraction of the wind plasma",
    "can generally be captured and accreted by the neutron star . after the secondary leaves the main - sequence and fills the roche - lobe , the rate of mass loss and , hence",
    ", the accretion rate can be drastically enhanced .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field of the newly born neutron star is created by an unspecified mechanism either in the course of collapse or soon after the neutron star is born .",
    "we also assume that the field is maintained by currents in the crust and occupies originally only a fraction of the crust volume .",
    "the evolution of the crustal field is determined by the conductive properties of the crust and material motion throughout it ( see for a detail sang & chanmugam 1987 , urpin & geppert 1995 ) . neglecting the anisotropy of conductivity , the induction equation governing",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the conductivity and @xmath10 is the velocity of material movement .",
    "the velocity @xmath10 is caused by the flux of the accreted matter throughout the crust and may be non - zero only during those evolutionary phases when accretion on to the neutron star surface is allowed .",
    "the total amount of the accreted mass in most cases does not exceed 0.1 - 0.2@xmath11 ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) , even for neutron stars undergoing a very extended accretion phase . therefore ,",
    "the mass and radius of the neutron star do not change significantly and , hence , the corresponding changes in the crustal thickness , density profile etc . are also negligible .",
    "the total mass flux is the same throughout the crust and should be taken equal to the accretion rate . assuming spherical symmetry of the mass flow in deep crustal layers , one obtains the radial velocity of material movement @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the accretion rate and @xmath14 is the density .",
    "this inward directed flow tries to push the magnetic field into the deep crustal layers and , generally , can influence the evolution of the field at a high accretion rate .    introducing the vector potential for a dipole magnetic field @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the spherical coordinates , the induction equation ( 1 ) can be transformed to @xmath18 at the surface @xmath19 , the standard boundary condition for a dipole field should be fulfilled , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "we assume the core of the neutron star to be superconductive , thus the magnetic field can not penetrate into the core .",
    "therefore , the second boundary condition is @xmath21 at the crust - core boundary which lies at the density @xmath22 g/@xmath23 .",
    "the conductive properties of the solid crust are determined by scattering of electrons on phonons and impurities ( see , e.g. , yakovlev & urpin 1980 ) . scattering on phonons dominates the transport processes at a relatively high temperature and low densities , whereas scattering on impurities gives the main contribution to the conductivity at a low temperature and large densities .",
    "the total conductivity of the crystallized region is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the conductivities due to electron - phonon scattering and electron - impurity scattering mechanisms , respectively .",
    "the phonon conductivity depends on the temperature , decreasing when @xmath27 increases , and hence heating caused by accretion accelerates the field decay .",
    "the impurity conductivity is practically independent of the temperature but its magnitude is determined by the so called impurity parameter , @xmath28 where the dominant background ion species has the number density @xmath29 and charge @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the number density of an impurity species of charge @xmath32 ; the summation is over all species of impurities . in our calculations , we use the numerical data for the phonon condutivity obtained by itoh et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and a simple analytical expression for the impurity conductivity derived by yakovlev & urpin ( 1980 ) . since the conductivity depends on the temperature , the magnetic evolution of the neutron star is strongly sensitive to its thermal history . according to the scenario suggested in section i",
    ", we divide the evolution into four essentially different phases : + the `` isolated pulsar '' phase ( phase i ) in which the neutron star practically does not feel the influence of its companion , + the `` propeller '' phase ( phase ii ) in which , due to a fast spin rotation , the neutron star ejects the wind matter penetrating into a magnetosphere , + the wind accretion phase ( phase iii ) in which accretion of the wind plasma is allowed , and + the accretion phase ( phase iv ) in which the secondary fills its roche - lobe and the neutron star experiences a heavy mass transfer . + evidently , that during the phases i and ii the thermal evolution of the neutron star in a binary system exactly follows that of an isolated neutron star . for the time dependence of the temperature during these two phases we use the standard cooling model as given by van riper ( 1991 ) for 1.4@xmath11 neutron star with the pandharipande - smith equation of state . during the phases iii and iv",
    ", however , the neutron star can be substantially heated by accretion .",
    "the thermal evolution of accreting neutron star has been a subject of study of several papers ( see , e.g. , fujimoto et al .",
    "1984 , miralda - escude et al .",
    "1991 , zdunik et al .",
    "it was argued that , after a relatively short initial stage , the temperature distribution within the neutron star reaches a steady state .",
    "then , the temperature is practically uniform in deep layers of the crust of neutron star with standard neutrino emissivities .",
    "the temperature that the crust will attain in the steady state depends on the accretion rate , @xmath13 . for the phase iii with a low accretion rate",
    ", we use the crustal temperature computed by zdunik et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the accretion rate within the range @xmath33/yr . for the phase iv when accretion is caused by roche - lobe overflow , the internal temperature has been calculated by fujimoto et al .",
    "( 1984 ) for the accretion rate @xmath34/yr and by miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for @xmath13 within the range @xmath35/yr .",
    "we matched their results and slightly extrapolate the obtained dependence in order to estimate @xmath27 for @xmath36/yr , the maximal accretion rate we use in calculations .",
    "note that the accretion rate during the phases iii and iv is sensitive to the separation between the stars and their masses . in the present study",
    "we will not consider the dependence of the evolution on the orbital period of a binary despite of the importance of this dependence for interpretation of observational data ( see van den heuvel & bitzaraki 1995 ) .",
    "we are planning to address this problem in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the spin evolution of the neutron star being strongly coupled with its magnetic evolution differs essentially for different evolutionary phases .",
    "as it was mentioned , the neutron star is practically not influenced by a companion during the phase i since the wind plasma of the secondary is stopped by the pressure of magnetodipole radiation behind the light cylinder .",
    "the stopping radius , @xmath37 , is determined by the balance between the dynamical pressure of the wind and the radiative pressure of magnetodipole waves .",
    "the dynamical pressure of the wind is of the order of @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the density and velocity of the wind plasma , respectively , near the stopping radius .",
    "the density , @xmath39 , at the distance @xmath41 from the secondary may be estimated as @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the rate of mass loss of the secondary .",
    "the pressure of the magnetodipole radiation at the distance @xmath37 from the neutron star is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the surface field strength at the magnetic pole and @xmath46 is the spin angular velocity of the neutron star . equating this pressure to the dynamical pressure of the wind at the nearest to the neutron star point and assuming that the stopping radius is smaller than separation between stars , @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 , one obtaines the expression for @xmath37 , @xmath49 in our calculations , it is more convenient to use the accretion rate , @xmath13 , instead of the rate of mass loss @xmath43 . at @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the radius of gravitational capture (",
    "bondi 1952 ) and @xmath52 is the neutron star mass , these quantities are related by @xmath53 ; we assume that the wind velocity is larger than both the sound velocity of the wind plasma and the velocity of orbital motion . the phase i lasts while the stopping radius is larger than the radius of gravitational capture , @xmath54 .    with the assumption that the spin down torque on the neutron star is caused by radiation of the magnetodipole waves ( ostriker & gunn 1969 ) ,",
    "the evolution of the spin period , @xmath55 , is governed by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the moment of inertia .",
    "note that approximately the same braking law applies if the torque is determined by currents in the model suggested by goldreich and julian ( 1969 ) . at @xmath58 , the pressure of the magnetodipole radiation can not prevent the wind plasma from a penetration behind the light cylinder .",
    "the influence of the wind plasma on the spin - down rate becomes appreciable and the further spin evolution of the neutron star departs from that of an isolated pulsar . in our simplified model , the condition @xmath59 determines the transition between the phases i and ii .    during the phase ii ,",
    "the wind matter can directly interact with the neutron star magnetosphere . however , rotation is rather fast yet and the magnetosphere acts as a `` propeller '' , ejecting the infalling wind matter . during this phase ,",
    "a certain fraction of the spin momentum of the neutron star is transfered to the matter being ejected , and the spin period may increase a few orders of magnitude . in calculations presented here , we adopt a very simplified model of the interaction between the accretion flow and magnetosphere which is , nevertheless , qualitatively close to that commonly encountered in the literature ( see , e.g. , pringle & rees 1972 , illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "we assume that the accreted matter interacts with the magnetosphere at the so called alfven radius , @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 g and @xmath63yr@xmath64 ; the numbers are given for the neutron star with @xmath65 and @xmath66 cm . if the neutron star rotates rapidly and its angular velocity is larger than the keplerian angular velocity at the alfven radius , @xmath67 , the wind matter has to be expelled by the magnetosphere carrying out the spin angular momentum . in order to be expelled , the wind matter should get the angular momentum a little bit larger than it corresponds to the keplerian rotation .",
    "therefore , the amount of the spin momentum lost by the neutron star per unit time , @xmath68 , may be estimated as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the radial velocity of the accreting flow near the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "the corresponding spin - down rate of the neutron star is @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the neutron star rotation slows down until the angular velocity becomes comparable to @xmath67 .",
    "we determine the critical period , @xmath73 , at which the transition between the `` propeller '' and accretion phases takes place from the condition @xmath74 , @xmath75 this period can be rather large if the neutron star is accompanied by a secondary star with a low rate of mass loss .",
    "equation ( 11 ) determines the so called spin up line in the @xmath45 - @xmath55 plane .",
    "if the spin rotation slows down to the value given by equation ( 11 ) , it is generally accepted that the accreting matter can flow throughout the magnetosphere and accrete on to the surface , thus the neutron star enters the phase iii . during this phase accretion from the stellar wind",
    "is allowed and , as it was mentioned , nuclear burning of the accreted material provides some heating of the neutron star interior and induces the accretion - driven field decay . in its turn , the decay of the magnetic field decreases the critical period , @xmath73 .",
    "since accretion from the wind in a binary can not be exactly spherical , the accreting matter carries some amount of the angular momentum to the neutron star ( see geppert et al . 1995 ) and , due to this , the neutron star can experience spin up to a shorter period .",
    "probably , a balance may be reached in spin up and the rate of the field decay , thus the neutron star slides down the corresponding spin - up line ( see , e.g. , bhattacharya & srinivasan 1991 ) .",
    "this evolution lasts either until the end of the main - sequence lifetime of the companion ( when it fills the roche - lobe and the neutron star enters the phase iv ) or until the magnetic field becomes weak to such extent that the accreting angular momentum is insufficient to maintain a balance in spin up and the rate of the field decay .",
    "the amount of the angular momentum carried by the accreted matter can be estimated from the condition at the magnetospheric boundary assuming that the angular momentum there is characterized by its keplerian value , @xmath76 , multiplied by a some `` efficiency '' factor @xmath77 .",
    "this factor is @xmath78 if the accreted wind matter forms a keplerian disc outside the magnetosphere .",
    "if the disc is not formed , then the efficiency of spin up is much lower and the parameter @xmath77 is probably of the order of 0.1 - 0.01 ( see jahan miri & bhattacharya 1994 ) .",
    "the amount of the spin angular momentum added to the neutron star per unit time , @xmath79 , can be estimated as @xmath80 the corresponding spin - up rate is @xmath81 if the magnetic field becomes very weak , @xmath82 may be small and accretion can not maintain a balance in the spin up and field decay rates , thus the neutron star leaves the spin - up line .    after the companion fills its roche - lobe and",
    "the phase iv starts , accretion onto the neutron star is strongly enhanced and heating of the crust leads to a rapid field decay .",
    "in low - mass binaries , accretion due to roche - lobe overflow can probably last as long as @xmath83 yr . during this phase , the accreted matter",
    "likely forms the keplerian disc outside the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , the rate of the angular momentum transfer and the spin - up rate are given by equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , respectively , with the `` efficiency '' parameter @xmath84 .",
    "the neutron star spins up in accordance with these equations until it approaches the spin - up line corresponding the enhanced accretion rate .",
    "probably , the accretion rate has to reduce when the neutron star reaches the spin - up line ( bhattacharya & srinivasan 1991 ) but , nevertheless , the field continues to decay due to the accretion - driven mechanism . during the further evolution",
    ", a balance should be reached in spin up and the rate of the field decay like the case of accretion from the wind . due to this balance ,",
    "the neutron star slides down the corresponding spin - up line with the rate which is determined by the field decay .",
    "in reality , the evolution on the spin - up line may be very complicated but , in our calculations , we will adopt a maximally simplified model .",
    "namely , we will neglect a possible difference in the accretion rate before and after the neutron star reaches the spin - up line . as mentioned above",
    ", the amount of matter accreted onto the surface may be reduced when the star evolves on the spin - up line .",
    "however , this decrease of the accretion rate can not probably change drastically the internal temperature because , at high accretion rates , the temperature is close to saturation and depends relatively weakly on the accretion rate ( see miralda - escude et al .",
    "1990 and fujimoto et al .",
    "1984 ) . therefore ,",
    "hopefully , our assumption does not change substantially the rate of the magnetic field decay on a spin - up line .",
    "note that in our model , the neutron star slides down the corresponding spin - up line with the maximal rate but , in reality , the evolution will be slower .",
    "the star can leave the spin - up line either if accretion is exhausted or if the field becomes too weak to maintain a balance in spin up and the field decay .",
    "we consider the evolution of the neutron star for a wide range of accretion rates and initial magnetic fields .",
    "calculations are performed for the neutron star model with @xmath85 based on the pandharipande - smith equation of state ( pandharipande & smith 1975 ) .",
    "this model is a representative of stiff equations of state , therefore the radius and thickness of the crust for the corresponding neutron star are relatively large , @xmath8616.4 km and @xmath864.2 km , respectively .",
    "we choose for calculations one of the stiff models because the magnetic evolution of isolated neutron stars based on such models is in a better agreement with the available observational data on pulsar magnetic fields ( urpin & konenkov 1997 ) .",
    "the evolution of neutron star models with equations of state softer than that of friedman - pandharipande seem to be inconsistent with b - p distribution of radio pulsars .",
    "the conductive properties of the crust depend on its chemical composition which , unfortunately , is rather uncertain for neutron stars .",
    "this dependence is not significant during the initial evolution when the magnetic field is confined to the layers with not very high density and the difference between existing models of the chemical composition is not very large .",
    "however , the effect of a composition may be important during the phase iv when the neutron star is essentially heated and the conductivity is determined by phonon scattering which is strongly sensitive to the chemical composition . therefore , in our calculations , we adopt the simplest model in accordance with which the crust is composed of nuclei processed in various nuclear transformations in accreting neutron stars ( see haensel & zdunik 1990 ) during the whole evolution of the neutron star .    in calculations ,",
    "the impurity parameter , @xmath87 , is assumed to be constant throughout the crust during the whole evolution and to range from 0.001 to 0.1 .",
    "the initial spin rotation is assumed to be relatively fast , @xmath88 s. note , however , that the results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath89 . on the contrary ,",
    "the evolution is strongly dependent on the original magnetic configuration of the neutron star .",
    "the initial magnetic field is assumed to be confined to the outer layers of the crust with densities @xmath90 .",
    "the calculations presented here are performed for @xmath91 ranged from @xmath92 to @xmath93 g/@xmath23 .",
    "these values correspond to the depth from the surface @xmath86820 and 1100 m , respectively .",
    "the choice of @xmath91 is imposed by comparing the calculated magnetic and spin evolution of isolated neutron stars with a crustal magnetic field with the available observational data on @xmath55 and @xmath82 for radiopulsars ( see urpin & konenkov 1997 ) .",
    "the initial field strength at the magnetic pole , @xmath94 , is taken within the range @xmath95 g.    the present study is mainly addressed to neutron stars entering binary systems with a low - mass companion . for such secondary stars , the main - sequence life - time , @xmath96 , may last as long as @xmath97 yr . during the main - sequence evolution of the secondary , the accretion rate onto the neutron star is determined by both the characteristics of stellar wind and separation between the stars , and may generally vary within a wide range . in calculations ,",
    "we suppose @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100/yr during the propeller and wind accretion phase ; @xmath101",
    "km / s , @xmath102 cm .",
    "we also assume @xmath103 for the efficiency parameter .",
    "note , however , that our calculations show a weak sensitivity of the evolutionary tracks to the particular choice of @xmath77 .",
    "after the secondary leaves the main - sequence and fills its roche - lobe , the accretion rate has to be strongly enhanced , @xmath104/yr . we do not consider a higher accretion rate because of the lack of calculations on the thermal structure of accreting neutron stars with @xmath105/yr .    figures 1 - 4 show examples of the magnetic , spin and thermal evolution of the neutron star in a binary system for different values of the parameters",
    ". numbers in the top panels indicate the evolutionary phase .",
    "note a difference in the horizontal scales for different phases .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are shown in solid lines if the accretion rates due to roche - lobe overflow is @xmath106/yr and in dashed lines if @xmath107/yr .    in fig.1",
    ", we plot the evolution for a relatively strong initial magnetic field , @xmath108 g , and for @xmath109 g/@xmath23 .",
    "the impurity parameter is @xmath110 , the duration of the main - sequence life - time of a low - mass companion is @xmath111 yr . accretion due to roche - lobe overflow is assumed to last as long as @xmath112 yr thus the total amount of accreted mass can reach @xmath113 if @xmath114/yr . during the phase iii , the accretion rate is @xmath115/yr .",
    "this model gives an example of the neutron star being processed in all evolutionary stages .",
    "the phase i , when the evolution of the neutron star is not influenced by a companion , lasts a bit less than @xmath116 yr . during this short stage ,",
    "the field does not decay significantly thus its surface strength is about @xmath117 g when the neutron star enters the `` propeller '' phase .",
    "an efficient spin down caused by a strong magnetodipole radiation leads to a rapid increase of the spin period from @xmath118 s to @xmath119 s. during the next evolutionary stage when the neutron star works as a propeller , the field continues to decay slowly because , after @xmath116 yr of the evolution , the temperature falls down to a very low value and the conductivity of crustal matter is high .",
    "note that during this stage the conductivity is determined by the impurity scattering and depends on the impurity parameter @xmath87 .",
    "the phase ii is relatively long ( @xmath120 myr ) but the field is still very strong ( @xmath121 g ) to the end of this phase .",
    "due to such a strong field , the neutron star can eject the wind matter penetrating into a magnetosphere as long as the spin period is shorter than @xmath122 s. when a spin rotation slows down to this period , the matter from the wind can fall on to the surface of the neutron star and it becomes a soft and not very bright x - ray source .",
    "nuclear burning of the accreted material heats the neutron star interior to @xmath123 k. however , this heating is too weak to accelerate appreciably the field decay thus the magnetic evolution during the wind accretion phase does not differ essentially from that of an isolated star .",
    "note that the wind accretion can accelerate the decay appreciably only if the accretion rate is larger than @xmath124/yr .",
    "to the end of the wind accretion , the field strength is still as high as @xmath125 g. the neutron star can slowly spin up getting some amount of angular momentum from the accreted wind matter but this amount is not enough to spin up to a short period , thus the period turns out to be as long as @xmath126 s after @xmath111 when the companion ends its main - sequence life .",
    "the phase iii is the most extended for the considered model , however , as it will be shown , it may not be the case for other models .",
    "the most dramatic changes are experienced by the neutron star during the phase iv when an enhanced accretion due to roche lobe overflow starts .",
    "accretion with the accretion rate @xmath127/yr or higher heats the neutron star to the temperature @xmath128 k and decreases substantially the crustal conductivity .",
    "if the field is reduced only by a factor @xmath129 during the previous @xmath111 years , the accretion - driven mechanism leads to a much more efficient decay .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath130/yr , the field weakens @xmath131 times after @xmath112 yr of accreting when the neutron star accretes @xmath132 . for a higher accretion rate ,",
    "the decay is even stronger .",
    "since the accreted matter carries out a large amount of the angular momentum , the neutron star can accelerate its spin rotation to relatively short periods during the phase iv .",
    "the spin evolution is non - monotonous ( this is shown in the small panel in fig.1 ) . at the beginning of accretion ,",
    "the neutron star spins up very rapidly and after @xmath133 yr it reaches the corresponding spin - up line .",
    "since the magnetic field is still sufficiently strong ( @xmath134 g ) , the corresponding critical period , @xmath73 , is relatively long ( @xmath78 s ) .",
    "the further spin evolution proceeds slowly because the neutron star slides down the spin - up line and the rate of this migration is determined by the field decay .",
    "finally , when accretion is exhausted after @xmath112 yr , the neutron star processed in the all above transformations will work as a radiopulsar with a low magnetic field ( @xmath135 g ) and a short period ( @xmath136 s ) .",
    "fig.2 shows one more example of the evolution which is typical for stars with a relatively weak initial magnetic field .",
    "the initial field is assumed to be @xmath137 g , other parameters are the same as in fig.1 . in this case , the neutron star does not pass throughout all evolutionary stages :",
    "accretion of matter from the wind is impossible because rotation spins down very slowly due to a weak magnetic field and , after @xmath111 yr , the period is still shorter than the corresponding value of @xmath73 .",
    "a weak initial field results in a very long duration of the phase i for this model : the period slows down to a value @xmath138 s which allows the infalling matter to interact with the magnetosphere only after @xmath139 myr .",

    "an enhanced accretion , however , can accelerate a spin rotation very rapidly thus an accreting neutron star forgets shortly about its period before the accretion phase .",

    "the further spin evolution on the spin - up line proceeds slower but , nevertheless , the star can reach millisecond periods if a mass transfer lasts as long as @xmath112 yr .",
    "for this model , the `` recycled '' periods when accretion is exhausted are @xmath78 and @xmath140 ms for @xmath145 and @xmath146/yr , respectively .",

    "when accretion exhausts , the neutron star can be observed as a millisecond radio pulsar with the period @xmath150 ms and magnetic field @xmath151 g.    in order to illustrate the effect of the impurity content , we plot in fig.3 the evolution of the neutron star with a strongly polluted crust , @xmath152 .",
    "we also assume that for this model the field is initially confined to the layer with a smaller density , @xmath153 g/@xmath23 , corresponding to the depth from the surface @xmath154 m. like the model plotted in fig.1 , this one passes also throughout all evolutionary stages .",
    "however , the field decays faster for this model because the crustal conductivity is lower due to a higher impurity content and the field is initially anchored in the layers with a lower density ( and , hence , a lower conductivity ) . a faster decay leads to slower spin down and longer duration of two first phases in comparison with fig.1 .",

    ", the field and spin are reduced sufficiently thus the wind matter can penetrate into the magnetosphere , and the neutron star works as a propeller .",
    "the `` propeller '' phase lasts until the neutron star moving to the right and down in the b - p plane reaches the corresponding spin - up line .",
    "evidently , the star which experiences a stronger accretion from the wind requires a shorter time to approach the spin - up line .",
    "thus , one has @xmath181 after 5 and 630 myr of evolution if @xmath182 and @xmath183/yr , respectively . as it was mentioned above , in the case of a very weak accretion with @xmath184/yr",
    "the spin - up line can never be reached .",
    "accretion from the wind starts when the magnetic field is still rather high for the models 1 - 4 , @xmath185 g. this field is certainly able to channel the accreting matter towards the magnetic poles thus , probably , some of neutron stars accreting matter from the wind in low - mass binaries can be observed as weak pulsating x - ray sources .",
    "a further evolution of the neutron star on the spin - up lines is completely determined by the field decay which can be accelerated due to accretion induced heating for a relatively high accretion rate .",
    "the wind accretion phase is the most extended phase for all models plotted in fig.5 with the exception of the model 5 .",
    "the parameters of stars can be drastically changed during this long phase if the accretion rate is sufficiently large .",
    "for instance , the field is reduced by a factor @xmath133 and is only @xmath186 g for the model 1 with the accretion rate @xmath187/yr .",
    "note , however , that at the end of the main - sequence lifetime of the companion the magnetic fields of the models 2 - 5 which experience accretion with @xmath188/yr lie within a relatively narrow range @xmath189 g despite of a large difference in a duration of different phases for these models .",
    "the main reason for this is a relatively weak heating caused by accretion with such low accretion rates what makes inefficient the accretion - driven mechanism at @xmath190/yr .",
    "when the companion fills its roche - lobe and an enhanced accretion starts , the neutron star spins up initially very rapidly : it requires only 0.2 myr to reach the spin - up line for the model 5 and 1.6 myr for the model 2 .",
    "these time intervals are too short for an appreciable decay of the magnetic field , therefore , the corresponding pieces of tracks are represented by approximately horizontal plateaus .",
    "note that the magnetic field of the model 1 is very weak after @xmath111 yr of evolution ( @xmath186 g ) , and this model will never reach the spin - up line . like the case of accretion from the stellar wind , in its further evolution , the neutron star slides down the spin - up line and the rate of this sliding is determined by the field decay .",
    "however , in the case of roche - lobe overflow , the accretion - driven mechanism is much more efficient and , hence , the decay is much faster . during the phase iv ,",
    "the magnetic field decreases by a factor @xmath191 for the models 2 - 5 , thus , when accretion is exhausted , all these neutron stars will work as pulsars with weak magnetic fields @xmath192 g and short periods @xmath193 ms .",
    "the model 1 is also spun up to a millisecond period but its magnetic field is substantially smaller than @xmath112 g.    in fig.6 , we plot the same as in fig.5 but for the magnetic field confined initially more deep layers , @xmath109 g/@xmath23 , and for the crust with a smaller impurity content , @xmath110 .",
    "evidently , the magnetic evolution is much slower for a less polluted crust .",
    "like the case shown in fig.5 , the models 1 - 4 pass throughout all evolutionary phases whereas the model 5 with a very weak accretion from the wind ( @xmath194/yr ) avoids the phase iii .",
    "due to a slower field decay and , hence , a faster spin down , the duration of the phases i and ii is shorter for the models in fig.6 than for the models with the same wind in fig.5 .",
    "therefore , the wind accretion starts when the magnetic field of the neutron star is very strong , @xmath195 g for all models . as in the previous case ,",
    "the wind accretion is the most extended phase for the models 1 - 4 . to the end of the main - sequence evolution of the companion ( @xmath196 yr ) , the magnetic field of neutron stars which experience",
    "the wind accretion with a low accretion rate , @xmath197/yr , lies in a narrow range from @xmath198 to @xmath199 g. only accretion with @xmath200/yr can substantially change the magnetic evolution during the phase iii .    due to a higher magnetic field at @xmath201 yr",
    ", the models plotted in fig.6 reach the spin - up line on a much shorter time scale when an enhanced accretion starts .",
    "thus , it requires only @xmath202 yr for the model 5 and @xmath203 myr for the model 1 .",
    "note that , in the previous case , the model 1 could never reach the spin - up line during the accretion phase .",
    "if accretion due to roche - lobe overflow lasts @xmath112 yr , the models 2 - 5 which experienced a weak accretion from the wind evolve to relatively weakly magnetized pulsars with @xmath204 g rotating with the period @xmath205 s. the model 1 with a very high accretion rate during the phase iii evolves to the millisecond pulsar with @xmath206 ms and @xmath207 g. obviously , the magnetic field and period are larger for all pulsars if the accretion phase is shorter .",
    "fig.7 compares the evolution of neutron stars with different initial magnetic fields and with the same @xmath91 and @xmath87 .",
    "calculations have been performed for @xmath109 g/@xmath23 , @xmath110 and @xmath196 yr .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the evolution is strongly sensitive to the initial field strength .",
    "the weaker is the magnetic field , the longer is the duration of the `` isolated pulsar '' and `` propeller '' phases and , correspondingly , the shorter is the wind accretion phase .",
    "for instance , the neutron star can work as an `` isolated pulsar '' only 0.5 myr if @xmath171 g but this stage may be as long as 63 myr if the initial field is weak , @xmath208 g. the strongly magnetized star with @xmath171 g can accrete matter from the stellar wind after @xmath209 myr whereas the weakly magnetized one with @xmath208 g after @xmath210 myr .",
    "to the beginning of the wind accretion , magnetic fields of the considered models lie within a wide range from @xmath0 to @xmath117 g. the corresponding periods are @xmath211 s. the wind accretion phase is the most extended phase for all models plotted in fig.7 . during two previous phases the magnetic field",
    "is typically reduced by a factor @xmath212 , whereas the decrease during a wind accretion is about 10 - 50 times .",
    "when the companion fills its roche - lobe and a heavy mass transfer starts , the field of the neutron star is @xmath213 and @xmath214 g for the most weakly and most strongly magnetized among the models presented in fig.7 , respectively . probably , these fields are too weak to channel the accreting matter towards the magnetic poles , thus the neutron star is unable to work as a pulsating x - ray source during the phase iv .",
    "an enhanced accretion accelerates the field decay thus , when the mass transfer is exhausted , the field and period of the models 1 - 3 turn out to be quite suitable for millisecond pulsars .",
    "the model 4 which has initially the strong magnetic field @xmath171 g may also be transformed into a weakly magnetized and rapidly rotating pulsar to the end of the accretion phase .",
    "however , the field of this pulsar ( @xmath215 g ) is a bit stronger and the period ( @xmath191 ms ) is a bit longer than it is typical for millisecond pulsars .",
    "evidently that , if accretion lasts longer than @xmath112 yr , the model 4 can also evolve to a millisecond pulsar with the standard parameters .    in fig.8 , the dependence of evolutionary tracks is shown on the duration of main - sequence lifetime of the companion , @xmath96 .",
    "since we address mainly the evolution of neutron stars entering binary systems with a low - mass companion , calculations have been done for a sufficiently long @xmath96 , @xmath216 yr . despite of the fact that we plot in this figure tracks for the neutron star with a relatively polluted crust with @xmath217 and for the initial magnetic field @xmath218 g which is certainly weaker than measured fields of many isolated pulsars , it is seen that crustal currents can maintain a sufficiently strong magnetic field during the whole evolution .",
    "this conclusion is in contrast with the widely accepted opinion that neutron star models with the crustal magnetic field are not suitable to account for a relatively strong magnetic field of many long - lived pulsars . even for a `` polluted '' crust ,",
    "the decay turns out to be very slow thus the neutron star can possess the field stronger than @xmath5 g after @xmath0 yr of evolution and an enhanced accretion .    during the `` isolated pulsar '' phase which lasts @xmath219 myr , the field weakens by a factor @xmath220 whereas during the `` propeller '' phase which is as long as @xmath221 myr the field is reduced only by a factor 2 . working during @xmath222 myr as a propeller ,",
    "the neutron star spins down to the period of the order of @xmath223 s which is slow enough to accrete the wind matter . at this moment , the field is rather strong , @xmath224 g , thus the accreted matter has to be channeled towards the magnetic poles .",
    "perhaps , during the wind accretion phase such a neutron star can be observed as a weak and pulsating x - ray source .",
    "when the companion fills its roche - lobe , the field of the neutron star can range from @xmath225 to @xmath125 g depending on the duration of main - sequence lifetime .",
    "the corresponding spin periods lie within the range 100 - 500 s. due to a relatively strong magnetic field , a spin - up is initially very fast thus the neutron star approaches the spin - up line shortly after the beginning of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the field does not change practically during this short time interval ( @xmath226 yr ) .",
    "in the course of the further evolution alongside the spin - up line , the field is decreased by a factor @xmath131 under the action of the accretion - driven mechanism thus to the end of the accretion phase a pulsar can be formed with @xmath227 g and @xmath228 ms .",
    "if accretion lasts longer than @xmath112 yr and the total amount of accreted mass is larger than @xmath132 , all the models plotted in fig.8 can evolve to `` standard '' millisecond pulsars with @xmath229 g and @xmath230 ms .",
    "note that if the mass of a low - mass companion is relatively large thus the main - sequence lifetime is closer @xmath5 yr rather than @xmath0 yr , then the field at the beginning of the phase iv is sufficiently strong ( @xmath231 g ) to channel the accreted matter towards the magnetic poles , and the neutron star can work as a pulsating x - ray source .",
    "to the end of accretion , the field has to be reduced to a very low value insufficient to produce x - ray pulses but sufficient for a neutron star to work as a radiopulsar .",
    "fig.9 shows the dependence of the evolution on the impurity `` pollution '' of the crust .",
    "calculations have been performed for the values of the impurity parameter , @xmath87 , within the range from 0.001 to 0.3 .",
    "the duration of the main - sequence lifetime of the companion is @xmath232 yr . during the initial evolution ,",
    "the field decay does not practically depend on the impurity parameter .",
    "this is due to the fact that the neutron star is relatively hot initially and the crustal conductivity is determined by phonon scattering which is independent of @xmath87 .",
    "later on , when the star cools down and the impurity scattering dominates the conductivity , the latter becomes sensitive to a `` polution '' of the crust and the decay may be essentially different for different @xmath87 .",
    "the behaviour of all models plotted in fig.9 is more or less standard during the main - sequence evolution of the companion .",
    "the only exception is the model 1 with extremely large @xmath87 . due to a large impurity content and , as a consequence , a low conductivity ,",
    "the magnetic field of this model decays too fast . during the phases i and ii which last together @xmath233 yr , the field strength has to be reduced more than 1000 times and , when the neutron star approaches the spin - up line corresponding to the wind accretion rate @xmath234/yr , its field is too low ( @xmath235 g ) to maintain a balance in spin up and the rate of the field decay .",
    "therefore , the neutron star does not slide down the spin - up line in its further evolution but moves down the b - p plane much faster . to the beginning of roche lobe",
    "overflow the field of the model i weakens to a very low value @xmath186 g. an enhanced accretion causes a further field decay thus when accretion is exhausted the field strength of this model is extremely low ( @xmath236 g ) and the pulsar is practically unobservable .",
    "the models 2 - 5 with @xmath237 indicate more or less reasonable behaviour .",
    "eventually , the neutron star passes throughout all evolutionary phases and , after all transformations , it forms a pulsar with a weak magnetic field ( @xmath238 g ) and a short period ( @xmath239 ms ) . note that , at the end of accretion , the field of the model 5 turns out to be lower than that of the models 3 and 4 despite of a smaller impurity parameter for the model 5 .",
    "due to a substantially higher conductivity , the field of the model 5 diffuses inward very slowly thus , after @xmath111 yr , the current maintaining the magnetic configuration is located at much lower densities than for the models 3 and 4 .",
    "when accretion due to roche - lobe overflow heats the neutron star to the temperature @xmath240 k , the conductivity of layers occupied by the current becomes essentially lower for the model 5 because of a low density .",
    "therefore , the field decays much faster for this model during the accretion phase and , at the end of evolution , it is even lower than for the model 3 and 4 .",
    "the dependence of the evolutionary tracks on the initial depth penetrated by the field is shown in fig.10 .",
    "we plot the tracks for four values of @xmath91 : @xmath137 ( curve 1 ) , @xmath178 ( 2 ) , @xmath93 ( 3 ) and @xmath241 g/@xmath23 ( 4 ) .",
    "evidently , the smaller is the initial depth penetrated by the field , the faster is the decay . for the model 1 with the magnetic field",
    "anchored initially in a relatively narrow surface layer with the depth @xmath242 m , the decay is so rapid that the neutron star can not even be processed in all evolutionary transformations : after @xmath111 yr of evolution the rotation is still fast enough to prevent accretion from the stellar wind .",
    "due to this , the model 1 evolves from the `` propeller '' phase directly to the enhanced accretion phase missing the wind accretion .",
    "however , even for this model , the field at the end of the mass transfer is sufficiently strong thus when accretion is exhausted the neutron star can work as a millisecond pulsar with @xmath243 g and @xmath244 ms .",
    "the models 2 - 4 pass throughout all phases and , evidently , the final magnetic fields for them are higher and the periods are longer . for example , at the end of accretion , @xmath45 may be as high as @xmath245 g for the model 4 where the field occupies initially about half a crustal thickness .",
    "we examined the magnetic and spin evolution of neutron stars in close binary systems with a low - mass companion . due to a long lifetime of the companion , evolutionary transformations of the neutron star",
    "may last as long as @xmath246 yr and may be very complex . likely , most of neutron stars in such binary systems experiences a heavy mass transfer ensued due to roche - lobe overflow . this mass transfer can be extremely extended and the total amount of the mass accreted by the neutron star can exceed @xmath247 ( see , e.g. , van den heuvel & bitzaraki 1995 ) . besides , the evolution of neutron stars in low - mass binaries has to be influenced by the stellar wind during the main - sequence life of the companion . due to this , the neutron star in the course of its evolution passes throughout several essentially different evolutionary phases .",
    "calculations presented here are performed in agreement with the standard scenario of evolution of the neutron star in a close binary system ( pringle & rees 1972 , illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) . according to this scenario ,",
    "the neutron star can be processed in four main evolutionary phases .",
    "initially , when the star rotates rapidly and the field is strong , the pressure of the pulsar radiation does not allow the wind matter to penetrate into the magnetosphere , and the neutron star evolves like an isolated pulsar .",
    "the duration of this stage may vary depending on the initial field strength and the rate of field decay as well as on the intensity of the stellar wind of the companion .",
    "the initial phase is obviously shorter for a neutron star with a higher magnetic field and for a stronger wind .",
    "thus , for the initial field as strong as @xmath93 g , the phase i may last only @xmath248 myr if the neutron star captures gravitationally @xmath249/yr from the wind plasma",
    ". however , this phase may be extremely long ( @xmath250 myr ) if the initial field is weak , @xmath251 g or if the rate of gravitational capture is small , @xmath252/yr .",
    "for the most of considered models , the field is typically reduced by a factor @xmath212 during this phase except the cases when its duration is extremely long .",
    "when the energy loss due to magnetodipole radiation slows down rotation to such extent that the wind matter can interact with the magnetosphere , the neutron star begins to work as a propeller ejecting the wind plasma . obviously , the propeller action is more efficient for a stronger magnetic field .",
    "the `` propeller '' phase is usually more extended than the phase i. during the `` propeller '' phase , the magnetic evolution of the neutron star in a binary does not differ from that of an isolated star . since the star is relatively cool to the beginning of the phase ii , the conductivity of the crustal matter is determined by impurity scattering and may be high for a low impurity content . due to this , typically , the field decays less during a more extended `` propeller '' phase than during a shorter `` isolated pulsar '' stage .",
    "the spin evolution proceeds , however , more rapidly because the rate of angular momentum loss is larger for the propeller effect than for the magnetodipole braking . during the `` propeller '' phase the neutron star can spin down to a very long period @xmath3 s. note that this period may be shorter for stars with low magnetic fields and for a stronger stellar wind .    in the further evolution",
    ", the spin period of the neutron star can reach the critical value given by equation ( 11 ) .",
    "when rotation becomes so slow , the centrifugal force is unable to eject the wind plasma penetrating into the magnetosphere , and the matter falls on to the neutron star surface .",
    "nuclear burning of the accreted material heats the neutron star , decreases the crustal conductivity and accelerates the field decay .",
    "note that an efficiency of the accretion - driven mechanism of the field decay is strongly sensitive to the accretion rate .",
    "the effect of accretion is relatively small for a low accretion rate , @xmath253/yr , but it may be of a great importance for higher accretion rates . during the wind accretion ,",
    "the neutron star slides down the corresponding spin - up line and the rate of this sliding is determined by the rate of the field decay .",
    "depending on the duration of this phase and the rate of accretion , the field can be reduced by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "since the accreted wind matter carries a some amount of the angular momentum , the neutron star can also spin up slightly during this phase but , for the most of considered cases , the spin period is still longer 1 s to the end of the main - sequence evolution of a companion .",
    "usually , the wind accretion phase is the most extended among all evolutionary phases .",
    "note , however , that the star can miss this stage in some cases ( low rate of mass loss by a secondary star , rapid decay of the magnetic field ) , thus the evolution goes directly from the `` propeller '' phase to an enhanced accretion .",
    "in low - mass binaries , the neutron star experiences the most dramatic changes during a heavy mass transfer which starts when the companion ends the main - sequence evolution and fills its roche - lobe .",
    "probably , a mass transfer in such systems can last as long as @xmath254 yr .",
    "nuclear burning of the accreted material can heat the neutron star interior to the temperature @xmath255 k and substantially reduce the crustal conductivity . due to this , the accretion - driven mechanism of the field decay is especially efficient during the phase iv .",
    "typically , the field may be reduced about 20 - 30 times if accretion lasts @xmath112 yr , but the decrease may be larger for a longer accretion . depending on the initial magnetic configuration and the duration of the main - sequence evolution ,",
    "the surface magnetic field can fall down to the value @xmath256 g to the end of a mass transfer .",
    "since the matter accreted from the disc carries a large angular momentum , the spin evolves very rapidly .",
    "the neutron star reach a spin - up line corresponding to the enhanced accretion on a short time scale , @xmath257 myr . in its further evolution ,",
    "the star moves along the spin - up line while the magnetic field enables to maintain a balance in spin up and the rate of the field decay . during this phase ,",
    "the accretion torque spins up the neutron star to a very short period , @xmath258 ms .",
    "our calculations show that the neutron star with the crustal magnetic configuration can maintain a relatively strong field during the whole evolution in low - mass binaries .",
    "even if the main - sequence life of a companion lasts as long as @xmath0 yr and , after that , the neutron star experiences a strong accretion with @xmath259/yr during @xmath112 yr , the magnetic field can be sufficiently strong to the end of the accretion phase .",
    "when accretion is exhausted , such a neutron star works as a radio pulsar with a weak magnetic field , @xmath260 g , and a short period , @xmath261 ms . these parameters are close to those of millisecond pulsars and , perhaps , these objects are formed in accordance with the considered scenario .",
    "note that if the main - sequence evolution is shorter and a mass transfer is not so extended , the neutron star processed in the above evolutionary transformations should have a stronger magnetic field and a longer period to the end of accretion .",

    "<S> the evolution of neutron stars in close binary systems with a low - mass companion is considered assuming the magnetic field to be confined within the solid crust . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the standard scenario of the evolution in a close binary system in accordance with which the neutron star passes throughout four evolutionary phases ( `` isolated pulsar ''  `` propeller ''  accretion from the wind of a companion  accretion due to roche - lobe overflow ) . </S>",
    "<S> calculations have been performed for a great variety of parameters characterizing the properties both of the neutron star and low - mass companion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that neutron stars with more or less standard magnetic field and spin period being processed in low - mass binaries can evolve to low - field rapidly rotating pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> even if the main - sequence life of a companion is as long as @xmath0 yr , the neutron star can maintain a relatively strong magnetic field to the end of the accretion phase . </S>",
