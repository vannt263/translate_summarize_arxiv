    "this survey detected over 350,000 sources in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) bands observed by irac .",
    "these objects have a redshift distribution that spans most of the history of the universe ( brodwin et al .",
    "2006 ) .",

    "diffuse infrared background from population  iii stars .",
    "_ while the first galaxies can not be individually detected with current instruments , the ensemble of primordial galaxies produces a diffuse extragalactic background , most prominently at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this background , which directly probes the earliest phases of star formation in the universe , has a distinct angular power spectrum that peaks at scales @xmath10 ( cooray et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the background also has a distinct spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , falling sharply shortward of redshifted ly@xmath11 ( @xmath12 m ) .",

    "these exciting , yet controversial , results have profound cosmological implications and have generated significant attention both in the press and in the astronomical community .",
    "in particular , there is concern that a significant fraction of the reported background is due to faint foreground sources , just below the point source detection level ( cooray et al .  2007 ; sullivan et al .",
    "the sdwfs dataset explores an ideal depth and area combination for removing the signal from local galaxy correlations from fluctuation maps ( bock et al .",
    "a fundamental limitation of deep fields for studies of primordial galaxy background fluctuations is that they are only two to three irac pointings across , and therefore probe only @xmath15 .",
    "sdwfs , with its wide - area , shallow coverage , is better - suited for studying the diffuse background because it probes the first - galaxy fluctuation spectrum on _ both _ sides of its predicted @xmath16 peak .",
    "deep observations are not essential ; sdwfs is sensitive to population  iii background fluctuation levels a factor of 20 fainter than claimed by kashlinsky et al .",

    "a red sequence of early - type galaxies , with negligible rates of ongoing star formation , is already in place by @xmath18 ( e.g. , stanford et al .",
    "2005 ) . despite having little star formation , the stellar mass within the red galaxy population increases by a factor of two or more between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , presumably due to the truncation of star formation in blue galaxies ( e.g. , bell et al .  2004 ; brown et al .  2007 ,",
    "faber et al .  2007 ) .",
    "where and why this occurs is unclear .",
    "cold dark matter models predict rapid growth of massive dark matter halos , even at late ( @xmath21 ) times .",
    "however , observations show that the most massive galaxies grow slowly at late times compared to lower - mass galaxies ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "2006 ) , a phenomenon commonly referred to as `` downsizing . ''",
    "to accurately measure how rapidly massive galaxies grow , one needs large volumes to measure the space density of galaxies with a precision of 10% or better .",
    "one can then determine how galaxies are growing relative to their host dark matter halos by measuring their clustering .",
    "as the evolving space density and clustering of dark matter halos are accurately modeled by analytic approximations and simulations , one can use the observed space density and clustering of galaxies to determine how galaxies populate dark matter halos ( e.g. , zehavi et al .",
    "white et al .  (",
    "2007 ) used the original botes field data to show that the evolving clustering of galaxies is inconsistent with passive models where massive galaxies do not merge over cosmic time .",
    "brown et al .  ( 2008 ) used the space density and clustering of galaxies to show that , at late times , massive galaxies grow slowly relative to their host dark matter halos , in part because much of the stellar mass within these halos resides within satellite galaxies .",
    "the deeper sdwfs data will improve the photometric redshifts for galaxies out to @xmath22 , allowing the extension of these studies to the epoch where the global star formation rate peaks .",
    "furthermore , the deeper sdwfs data should result in the detection of ten @xmath23 clusters with halo masses of @xmath24@xmath25  or more .",
    "these may be the environments in which the first red galaxies formed .",
    "will these clusters contain massive galaxies , or will we see evidence for the cluster galaxies growing hierarchically from @xmath26 until the present day ?",
    "_ irac studies of agn and agn variability",
    ". _ the primary goals of the botes agn effort include studying the full ( x - ray to radio ) seds of agn ( e.g. , hickox et al .  2007 ; gorjian et al .  2008 ; higdon et al .",
    "2008 ) , to determine the infrared luminosity functions of quasars ( e.g. , brown et al .  2006 ) , to study the physics of agn with less sensitivity to selection effects such as dust extinction ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "2005 ) , to examine the distribution of agn eddington ratios ( kollmeier et al .",
    "2006 ) , and to probe the relation of agn to their large - scale environments ( e.g. , galametz et al .  2009 ) .",
    "in particular , agn are known to exhibit photometric variability throughout the electromagnetic spectrum . by cadencing the irac observations over multiple visibility windows",
    ", sdwfs has opened the largely unexplored territory of mid - ir variability .",
    "dramatic agn variations have been seen at x - ray , optical , near - infrared , and radio wavelengths ( e.g. , hovatta et al .",
    "2008 ; papadakis et al .",
    "2008 ; sarajedini et al .",
    "monitoring campaigns are an efficient method to identify agn and provide information on the size scales , geometries , and physics of the nuclear regions , providing fundamental tests of unified agn models .",
    "the challenges of ground - based mid - ir astronomy , however , have largely restricted infrared variability studies to low - luminosity , nearby sources .",
    "one study found variability in most ( 39/41 ) sources , with variability most apparent at longer wavelengths ( glass 2004 ) .",
    "the wide - area , shallow sdwfs program is the ideal exploratory probe to identify the brightest , most variable infrared sources for detailed study and multiwavelength monitoring while mid - ir capabilities are still available .    _ the coldest brown dwarfs .",
    "_ one of the most important observational topics in the field of sub - stellar objects is the detection and characterization of objects cooler than t  dwarfs  the so - called y  dwarfs , cooler than about 700k .",
    "such objects must exist because brown dwarfs with inferred masses down to @xmath27m@xmath28 have been identified in star - forming regions .",
    "according to theoretical models , dwarfs less massive than 30m@xmath28 with ages @xmath29gyr should have t@xmath30600k , but none has yet been found . this is primarily because their seds peak at @xmath31 m ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "2003 ) , making them very faint at ground - based optical through near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "for instance , while a 600k brown dwarf could be detected by 2mass only if closer than @xmath32pc , it would be detectable in a single sdwfs epoch out to almost 50pc at 4.5 . moreover , the multi - epoch sdwfs survey can detect the proper motion of any dwarf with tangential velocity @xmath3320kms@xmath34 out to 50pc .",
    "the models of martin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) predict that about 10% of brown dwarfs should be of type y. sdwfs ought to detect @xmath27 brown dwarfs cooler than 1400k , and there is a reasonable chance of detecting a y dwarf .",
    "our multi - epoch survey will thus provide a systematic census of faint brown dwarfs .",
    "we have already confirmed one t4.5 brown dwarf from the original irac shallow survey ( stern et al .",
    "2007 ) , and we have identified four additional mid - t brown dwarf candidates based on proper motion measurements in the sdwfs data set (  4.6 ) . a sample of cooler brown dwarf candidates , later than approximately t7 , has recently been identified from the full sdwfs data set ( eisenhardt et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) . including the optical data , the botes field s 13-year baseline will also provide a long lever arm for proper motion studies of other ( less red ) galactic populations .",
    "much as the great observatory origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) fields have become the fields of choice for ultradeep pencil - beam surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum , the 9 deg@xmath6 botes field has become the wide - area , deep survey field of choice and thus was chosen as the target field for sdwfs .",

    "most of these multiwavelength data are ( or will be ) public , and over 80 refereed papers have been published from the botes surveys .    this paper is organized as follows :  2 discusses the details of the sdwfs observing strategy and data reduction , and  3 describes the source identification , astrometric verification , and photometry .",
    "section 4 presents preliminary results from the analysis of the sdwfs data , including mid - ir number counts , color distributions , and identification fractions for both radio and x - ray sources .",
    "section 5 summarizes these results . unless otherwise stated , all magnitudes are in the vega system .",
    "the sdwfs observing campaign consisted of four co - extensive surveys of the 8.5 square degree botes field , carried out over roughly four years ( table  1 ) .",
    "the first visit to the field occurred close to the start of the _ spitzer _  mission , in 2004 january , as part of a guaranteed time program led by the irac instrument team .",
    "this program was called the irac shallow survey ( pid  30 ; eisenhardt et al .",
    "2004 ) and has had numerous successes , as discussed  1 . a subsequent visit as part of the sdwfs program in 2007 august remapped the same region to the same depth , and the final two visits , again to the same depth , were at the beginning and end of the following visibility window ( 2008 february and march ) .",
    "together , these four observations provide temporal intervals of one month , six months , and 3.5 years between visits ( table  [ tbl.epochs ] ) .",

    "the entire botes field was observed to a depth of 90s per sky position .",
    "the field was split into 15 ` groups ' , each consisting of three coextensive astronomical observing requests ( aors ) . on average ,",
    "each group covered approximately 45@xmath3645 , or @xmath37 irac pointings . in practice , group size and shape",
    "varied because of the gerrymandering needed to fit groups to the chevron shape of the existing optical / near - infrared coverage of the ndwfs .    to ensure that flux from asteroids",
    "could later be reliably masked and excluded from the sdwfs mosaics , each group was observed in three passes of 30s depth , with each pass of each group constituting a separate aor .",
    "the 30s frame time provided background - limited or nearly background - limited data in all four irac bands and ensured that dithering overheads did not dominate the aor execution time .",
    "the time required to obtain a single 30s pass on a group ensured gaps of at least 2hr between observations of each sky position . for typical asteroid motions of 25 hr@xmath34 , asteroids moved by @xmath38 between maps .",
    "since this is much smaller than a typical map width , this mapping strategy reliably tracks asteroid motions , thus providing both a clean , final mosaic for galactic and extragalactic studies and a scientifically valuable asteroid sample at high ecliptic latitude .",
    "our mapping strategy incorporated several elements to facilitate self - calibration of the data by maximizing inter - pixel correlations ( e.g. , arendt et al .",
    "we _ dithered _",
    "the observations on small scales and _ offset _ by one - third of an irac field of view between successive passes through each group .",
    "this provided inter - pixel correlation information on both small and large scales .",
    "in addition , for aor groups having rectangular shapes , we _ cadenced _ the observations",
    "such that revisits cover the same area but with a different step size .",
    "for example , a group that imaged a 40@xmath3660 region using an @xmath39 grid map with 290 step size subsequently used @xmath40 and @xmath41 grid maps ( with suitably scaled down step sizes ) . with a @xmath42 penalty in mapping efficiency , cadencing significantly",
    "enhances the inter - pixel correlations across all scales and greatly increases the redundancy of the datasets . finally , by reobserving the field multiple times at different roll angles and different times , our observing strategy is very robust against bad rows and columns , large - scale cosmetic defects on the array , glints , changes in the zodiacal background , after - images resulting from saturation due to bright stars , variations in the zero level , and the color dependence of the irac flat - field across the array ( hora et al .",
    "2008 ) . in particular , the challenging diffuse background measurements , one of the key goals of the sdwfs project ( e.g. , sullivan et al .",
    "2007 ) , are vastly aided by the redundant coverage : independent data sets are the best way to assess many systematic errors .",
    "the final sdwfs coverage is @xmath43s for each epoch and @xmath44s for the complete survey . the number of exposures needed to cover the field in a single epoch varied from 17,014 to 20,680 , depending on roll angle . the full , co - added sdwfs 3.6@xmath14 m map is presented in figure  [ ch1_image ] , and the corresponding coverage map is presented in figure  [ cvg_map ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cutouts ] illustrates how the source density changes through the irac bands at the full sdwfs depths .",
    "figure  [ fig : coverage ] presents the cumulative area coverage as a function of exposure time .",
    "the data reduction was based on the irac basic calibrated data ( bcd ) .",
    "the 3.6 , 5.8 , and 8.0micron  bcd frames were object - masked and median - stacked on a per - aor basis ; the resulting stacked images were visually inspected and subtracted from individual bcds within each aor to eliminate long - term residual images arising from prior observations of bright sources .",
    "this was not necessary for the 4.5  bcds because the 4.5  irac detector array does not suffer from residual images .",
    "the first two epochs were processed with pipeline version 16.0.1 .",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5  bcds were examined by hand and modified using custom software routines to correct column pulldown and multiplexer bleed effects associated with bright sources .",
    "much of this software is available from the _ spitzer _  science center and is based on algorithms designed and coded by sdwfs co - i s .",
    "the last two epochs were processed with pipeline version 17.0.4 . for these",
    ", we used the so - called corrected bcd frames , in which the bcd pipeline automatically applies multiplexer bleed and column pulldown corrections .",
    "the photometric calibrations are identical for both pipelines .",
    "after these preliminaries , the data were mosaiced into eight overlapping sub - fields ( tiles ) , each slightly larger than a degree across , using iracproc ( schuster et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to take some advantage of the subpixel shifts of our mapping strategy ,",
    "the mosaics were resampled to 084 per pixel , so that each mosaic pixel subtends half the area of the native irac pixel .",
    "iracproc augments the capabilities of the standard irac reduction software ( mopex ) .",
    "the software was configured to automatically flag and reject cosmic ray hits based on pipeline - generated masks together with a sigma - clipping algorithm for spatially coincident pixels .",
    "iracproc calculates the spatial derivative of each image and adjusts the clipping algorithm accordingly .",
    "thus , pixels where the derivative is low ( in the field ) are clipped more aggressively than are pixels where the spatial derivative is high ( point sources ) .",
    "this avoids downward biasing of point source fluxes in the output mosaics . for the final , total coadd ( @xmath45s ) of all four epochs , we proceeded in the same manner as for the individual epochs with the minor change that only temporal outlier rejection was performed .    for both the single - epoch and the total coadds , the outlier rejection threshold was iteratively refined by inspecting difference images (  [ ssec : irvar ] )",
    ": we subtracted successive epochs from each other to suppress emission from the non - varying celestial sources ( i.e. , almost all of them ) , so that cosmic ray artifacts became obvious against the dramatically flattened background .",
    "each tile was reduced independently of all other tiles .",
    "iracproc automatically identified and incorporated all exposures overlapping the specified field of a given tile into the corresponding mosaic .",
    "this inevitably resulted in each tile having some amount of irregular , low - coverage ` crust ' on its periphery even though the depth of coverage within each tile s analysis region was complete and free of cosmic rays by virtue of the iterated outlier rejection described above .",
    "the tiles were subsequently combined into full - field images , one for each band and each epoch , using the montage toolkit ( ver .",
    "3.0 ; berriman et al .",
    "the coverage maps were used as a means of preventing the low - coverage peripheral ` crusts '  with their relatively high prevalence of cosmic ray hits  from degrading the final mosaics .",
    "the outcome was a suite of 20 mosaics : four from each of the four epochs , plus another four for the total 12@xmath3630s coadd .",
    "these data , including coverage maps and catalogs , are all available from the _ spitzer _  science center .",
    "the survey depths achieved are well above the confusion limits even when all four epochs are combined into total coadds comprising 12@xmath3630s coverage . for this reason we constructed source catalogs using sextractor ( ver .",
    "2.5.0 ; bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , a standard tool for these purposes .",
    "in addition to source catalogs , we also generated both background and object ` check - images . ' inspecting those check - images , we iteratively chose parameter settings , ultimately settling on the values listed in table  [ tab : settings ] .",
    "the outcomes did not depend sensitively on many of the parameters , although the correct choices of convolution filter width and deblending parameters were necessary in order to obtain ` object ' check images that appeared complete upon inspection .",
    "we used the coverage maps as detection weight images in the standard way .",
    "regions covered by fewer than two exposures were excluded using separate ` flag ' images constructed from the coverage maps .",

    "we compiled fluxes and magnitudes within ten apertures having diameters from 1 to 10  in 1  increments , plus 15 and 24 , for twelve apertures in all .",
    "we also measured mag_auto magnitudes , for which sextractor measures sources fluxes interior to elliptical apertures with sizes and orientations determined using the second - order moments of the light distribution measured above the isophotal threshold .",
    "having first verified that the astrometry is accurate on scales much smaller than a sdwfs mosaic pixel (   [ sec : astrometry ] ) , we used sextractor in dual - image mode to photometer the sdwfs mosaics . in dual - image mode ,",
    "sources are detected , their centers are located , and their apertures are defined in one image , and subsequently photometry is carried out in another image using those pre - established apertures and source centroids .",
    "we used the four - epoch 12@xmath3630s mosaics as the detection images in all cases because of their superior noise properties .",

    "details and complete results will be reported elsewhere ( kozowski et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) but we present initial findings here .",
    "each single - epoch mosaic was prepared for difference - imaging by constructing a smoothed estimate of the _ spitzer _ psf .",
    "we used fourier methods to create new versions of the mosaics in which the native irac psfs were converted into gaussians of similar width .",
    "this removed the complex , rotated diffraction spikes for which difference imaging algorithms are not generally designed .",
    "we then used the difference image analysis package ( dia ; woniak 2000 ) to subtract successive sdwfs epochs .",
    "the variability ( dispersion ) was estimated for each object detected in the four difference images , where the average image of the four epochs was subtracted from each epoch .",
    "the difference imaging techniques were very useful in the data processing phase discussed in  2.2 because they allowed rapid identification of artifacts in the sdwfs mosaics . with almost all the sources vanishing ( because they are not variable )",
    ", even low level artifacts stood out .",
    "more importantly , this technique directly addresses the greatest limitation of mid - ir color selection of agn : that it begins to fail as the agn luminosities diminish to levels comparable to those of the host galaxies and the combined mid - ir colors become bluer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to identify lower - redshift , lower - luminosity agn .",
    "time variability and difference imaging eliminate the contaminating hosts and extend the detectability of agn in the mid - ir into the host - dominated regime where many x - ray and radio sources are also observed .",
    "the overall dependence of variability on magnitude is shown in figure  [ fig : variables ] .",
    "candidate variable sources were selected as significant outliers from the general trend , and , unsurprisingly , the resulting sample is dominated by agn with a distribution in mid - ir color - color space similar to the x - ray sources of figure  [ fig : xrayradio ] .",
    "we calculated the dispersions separately at 3.6 and 4.5 , as well as the correlations in the changes between the two bands .",
    "we designated an object as ir - variable if it changed by @xmath83 in both bands , if those changes were in synchrony ( correlation @xmath84 ) , and if the uncertainties in the 3.6 and 4.5magnitudes were below 0.05mag .",
    "we identified 379 variable objects on the basis of these criteria , or about 45deg@xmath61 to the depth of a single sdwfs epoch .",
    "of these , 272 objects were found to reside in the agn wedge and 107 objects fell outside it ( figure  [ fig : variables ] ) .      of the wide - area surveys done by _",
    "spitzer _ to date , sdwfs is unique in its ability to identify high proper - motion mid - ir sources .",
    "this is particularly promising for identifying the coolest brown dwarfs , since such sources are very faint optically but bright in the mid - ir .",
    "for example , mid - t brown dwarfs have @xmath85 } \\approx 10 $ ] ( strauss et al .  1999 ;",
    "tsvetanov et al .",
    "2000 ; patten et al .  2006 ) , implying that the single - epoch sdwfs mosaics reach the equivalent of @xmath86 for the coolest substellar sources .",
    "thus , although sdwfs covers only a small fraction of the sky , it samples @xmath87 times the volume of the full - sky proper motion catalog of luyten ( 1979 ) for mid - t brown dwarfs .",
    "any cool brown dwarfs identified in a shallow , wide - area survey such as sdwfs would be relatively nearby and thus might be identifiable from their high proper motions alone .",
    "in particular , the abundances and mid - ir properties of the coldest brown dwarfs ( the so - called `` _ y dwarfs _ '' ) are uncertain ( or , at least , untested ) currently , providing additional strong motivation for high proper motion mid - ir searches within the sdwfs survey . since cool brown dwarfs have red [ 3.6]@xmath50[4.5 ] colors , we searched for high proper motion objects independently in the two bluest irac bands .",
    "we began with the sextractor catalogs for the four single - epoch irac images at both 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath14 m .",
    "each epoch contains approximately 500,000 identified sources , and we cross - matched the catalogs using mergecats , a routine from the imcat toolkit written by n. kaiser for rapid positional cross - correlations of large data sets .",
    "we matched the first - epoch sdwfs catalog ( e.g. , our reprocessed original irac shallow survey ) to both the third and fourth epochs of sdwfs using a 10 search radius .",
    "these last two sdwfs epochs were obtained approximately one month apart in spring 2008 , a little more than four years after the first epoch ( ut 2004 january 10@xmath5014 ) .",
    "we then selected objects which moved by at least 125 ( @xmath88 ) between both epochs one and three , _ and _ between epochs one and four . because epochs three and four were only a month apart ( table  [ tbl.epochs ] ) , this removed many spurious sources with negligible impact on the highest proper motion sources .",
    "epoch two was ignored for this preliminary investigation of high proper motion sdwfs sources . to remove additional spurious sources ( e.g. , cosmic rays )",
    ", we also required that the candidates were not saturated and that they varied by less than 0.2mag between 2004 and 2008 .",
    "for the 3.6  selection , we required that sources were brighter than 18.5 mag in epoch  one ( aperture - corrected 3  diameter magnitude ) .",
    "the corresponding requirement for the 4.5micronselection was [ 4.5]@xmath89 .",
    "although these requirements are somewhat conservative , they should identify the most reliable , highest proper motion sources across the sdwfs data set .",
    "other techniques , such as image subtraction and creating local reference frames , should identify objects with substantially smaller proper motions .",
    "the criteria above led to samples of 27 3.6-selected candidates and 60 4.5-selected candidates .",
    "we visually inspected all candidates .",
    "most proved spurious , with the primary contaminant being merged , confused sources .",
    "a few others were artifacts from cosmic rays , the stellar bleed trails of bright stars , and sources near the edge of the irac mosaics that survived the automated culling .",
    "after inspection , four sources survived , with the two brightest identified independently at both 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath14 m and two fainter sources only identified at 4.5@xmath14 m .",
    "of the two single - band candidates , one omission ( sdwfs  j142534.1 + 325204 ) is attributable to a stellar bleed trail affecting the source in the third - epoch 3.6@xmath14 m data . the other source , sdwfs  j142723.4 + 330403 , had 3.6  @xmath14 m motions just below our selection thresholds . because this source has very red [ 3.6]@xmath50[4.5 ] colors ,",
    "the 4.5@xmath14 m data actually provide higher signal - to - noise , and we consider this source robustly identified .",
    "table  6 presents the basic information for all four candidates , and figure  16 presents their @xmath90-band and multi - epoch irac images .",
