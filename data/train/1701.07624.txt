    "after the first realization of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite , overwhelming experimental progresses have been made to enable us to control system parameters at will  @xcite .",
    "for example , the interaction between atoms can be controlled by varying a magnetic field through a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "this technique applied to two - component fermi gases led to the realization of a crossover to a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid of cooper pairs from a bec of tightly - bound molecules  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dimensionality can be controlled by confining atoms with an optical lattice generated by two counter - propagating laser beams  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bcs - bec crossover in two dimensions ( 2d ) has also come close to the reach of experimental investigation  @xcite , which may provide important insights into layered superconductors  @xcite .",
    "more recently , enormous research efforts have been devoted to develop experimental techniques to create synthetic magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "one approach is to couple internal states of atoms by laser beams so that neutral atoms behave like charged particles in a magnetic field  @xcite , which opened up a new avenue toward the realization of quantum hall physics with ultracold atoms .",
    "this approach was further extended to create `` antiparallel '' magnetic fields , which act on two different spin components of atoms with the same magnitude but in opposite directions  @xcite . while they were implemented for a two - component bose gas of rubidium atoms to observe a spin hall effect ,",
    "the same technique is in principle applicable to two - component fermi gases .",
    "there have also been proposals to create antiparallel magnetic fields by inducing laser - assisted tunneling in a tilted optical lattice  @xcite , aiming at the realization of the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect  @xcite .    motivated by these experimental abilities to control the interaction , dimensionality , and magnetic fields , we study a 2d fermi gas with an attractive interaction between two spin components in antiparallel magnetic fields .",
    "while the attractive interaction generally favors the cooper pairing , the antiparallel magnetic fields lead to landau - level formation with opposite chiralities for different spin components of fermions",
    ". how do they compete or cooperate to give rise to interesting physics ?",
    "this is the subject to be elucidated in this paper . besides its own importance",
    ", our system may also be viewed as a simulator of analogous phenomena in other fields , such as exciton condensation and chiral condensation in a magnetic field , where two particles forming a pair have opposite charges and thus experience opposite lorentz forces  @xcite .",
    "for related theoretical works on a 2d bose gas and on a 3d fermi gas , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we set @xmath0 and denote the magnetic length and the cyclotron frequency by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we also use shorthand notations , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the matsubara frequency and the wavenumber , respectively , and @xmath10 labels landau levels . the inverse temperature @xmath11 and the linear size of the system @xmath12",

    "[ sec : formulation ] , while the zero temperature and thermodynamic limits @xmath13 are taken at the end .",
    "let us start with spin-@xmath14 fermions in 2d subjected to spin - dependent vector potentials , which are described by the following imaginary - time action : @xmath15\\phi_\\sigma(x ) \\notag\\\\ & \\quad - g\\int\\!dx\\,\\phi_{\\uparrow}^*(x)\\phi_{\\downarrow}^*(x)\\phi_{\\downarrow}(x)\\phi_{\\uparrow}(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mass and chemical potential common to both spin components of fermions and the coupling constant @xmath18 is assumed to be attractive .",
    "we also choose the vector potentials as @xmath19 so that different spin components experience antiparallel magnetic fields with the magnitude @xmath20 ; @xmath21 .",
    "note that this particular way of introducing the magnetic fields preserves the time - reversal symmetry as well as the spin conservation .    to facilitate our theoretical analysis ,",
    "it is convenient to employ the hubbard - stratonovich transformation  @xcite , @xmath22 so that the interaction term in the action is decoupled at the expense of introducing the pair field @xmath23 .",
    "we then expand the nambu - gorkov spinor @xmath24 over the eigenfunctions of the single - particle hamiltonian . here",
    "the eigenfunction is @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the @xmath27th eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator , which solves the schrdinger equation @xmath28\\chi_k(x)={\\epsilon}_l\\chi_k(x)$ ] with the single - particle energy provided by @xmath29 . by substituting the resulting expansion @xmath30 , the action is now expressed as @xmath31 where the inverse nambu - gorkov propagator is defined by @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    finally , by integrating out the fermion fields",
    ", we obtain the effective action written in terms of the pair field : @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while this expression is formally exact with the understanding of the renormalization procedure discussed below , some approximation needs to be employed to proceed .",
    "we first employ the mean - field approximation in sec .",

    "sec : universality ] to elucidate the universality class of quantum phase transitions therein .",
    "to investigate the phase diagram at zero temperature , we employ the mean - field approximation . by setting @xmath36 and thus @xmath37 ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential @xmath38 is found to be @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the quasiparticle energy and an energy cutoff @xmath41 is introduced because the second term turns out to be logarithmically divergent .",
    "this logarithmic divergence should be canceled by the same form of divergence hidden in the coupling constant  @xcite : @xmath42 here @xmath43 has the physical meaning of the binding energy of a two - body bound state in the vacuum without magnetic fields , which always exists for any @xmath18 in 2d and thus can be used to parametrize the attraction  @xcite . by separating out the divergent piece from the second term , combining it with the first term , and then taking the limit of @xmath44 , the thermodynamic potential",

    ", we find a second - order quantum phase transition from a normal state with @xmath51 to a superfluid state with @xmath52 by increasing the two - body binding energy @xmath53 .",

    "there are three types of phases corresponding to the vacuum , the pair superfluid , and the quantum spin hall insulator labeled by its filling factor @xmath59 .",
    "they are separated by the second - order quantum phase transition located at eq .",
    "( [ eq : boundary ] ) . ]    as one can see from the phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_boundary ] , the normal state with @xmath51 is divided into different phases corresponding to different filling factors @xmath60 .",
    "the number density therein is provided by @xmath61 and thus the phase for @xmath62 is just the vacuum where no particles are present . on the other hand , for @xmath63 , each spin component of fermions fills @xmath64 landau levels so that our system becomes the qsh insulator composed of two quantum hall states with opposite chiralities for different spin components  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the phase diagram is occupied by the pair superfluid state with the nonzero pairing gap @xmath52 , whose behavior shall be investigated further .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in the superfluid phase is described by the number density equation , @xmath65 together with the gap equation , @xmath66 : @xmath67 in the strong - coupling limit @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 so that the number density equation reduces to @xmath70 , while the gap equation reduces to @xmath71 . therefore , we find @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the fermi energy , which coincide with the results for the 2d bcs - bec crossover without magnetic fields  @xcite . this is understandable because our system in the strong - coupling limit consists of tightly - bound spin - singlet molecules , for which the antiparallel magnetic fields cancel out .",
    "on the other hand , the superfluid phase can persist down to the weak - coupling limit @xmath74 only when the chemical potential lies right at a landau level , i.e. , @xmath75 for some @xmath50 .",
    "the number density in this case reduces to @xmath76 , while the gap equation is solved by @xmath77 therefore , we find that the pairing gap in terms of the small coupling constant ( [ eq : coupling ] ) is expressed as @xmath78 which exhibits the remarkable linear dependence in contrast to the usual exponential dependence without magnetic fields ; @xmath79  @xcite .",

    "the solid curve shows the result in the presence of the antiparallel magnetic fields with @xmath80 , while the dotted curve shows @xmath81 in their absence . ]    the pairing gap beyond the weak - coupling limit is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairing_gap ] , which is obtained by solving the coupled eqs .",
    "( [ eq : number ] ) and ( [ eq : gap ] ) . here",
    "one can see that the pairing gap is indeed enhanced significantly by the antiparallel magnetic fields , which may facilitate the realization of the pair superfluid in 2d by ultracold atom experiments .",
    "the phase diagram obtained in the previous section closely resembles that of the bose - hubbard model which consists of superfluid and mott insulator phases  @xcite .",
    "here it was revealed that the quantum phase transition between them is classified into the universality class of either the dilute bose gas or the xy model .",
    "this fact and the mutual resemblance motivate us to elucidate the universality class of the quantum phase transition in our system .    in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition , the effective action ( [ eq : effective ] ) can be expanded with respect to the pair field @xmath23 assumed to be small and smooth . by keeping terms up to the quartic order in @xmath23 and the quadratic order in derivatives ,",

    "( [ eq : boundary ] ) is crossed .",
    "furthermore , because we can find the relationship , @xmath88 @xmath89 vanishes at @xmath90 corresponding to the tip of each qsh phase marked by the red dot in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_boundary ] .    when @xmath91 , the ginzburg - landau action ( [ eq : ginzburg - landau ] ) is invariant under the exchange of @xmath92 , which signals the particle - hole symmetry emergent in the low - energy limit .",
    "accordingly , the equation of motion obeyed by the pair field , @xmath93 , becomes the nonlinear klein - gordon equation , which is relativistic and lorentz invariant .",
    "here the quantum phase transition turns out to be in the universality class of the xy model  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "away from the tip of the qsh phase , the @xmath84 term in the action is negligible with respect to the nonvanishing @xmath89 term . in this case , the equation of motion is the usual gross - pitaevskii equation and thus the quantum phase transition falls into the universality class of the dilute bose gas  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we studied competition and cooperation between the attractive interaction and the antiparallel magnetic fields in a 2d fermi gas .",
    "when the chemical potential does not match any landau levels , the antiparallel magnetic fields compete with the cooper pairing , i.e , our system becomes a qsh insulator and can be a pair superfluid only by a sufficient attraction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_boundary ] ) . by employing the mean - field approximation at zero temperature",
    ", we found that these two phases are separated by a second - order quantum phase transition .",
    "its universality class turns out to be of the xy model at the tip of each qsh phase and of the dilute bose gas elsewhere , which closely resembles the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the chemical potential matches some landau level , the antiparallel magnetic fields in turn cooperate with the cooper pairing , i.e , not only our system can be a pair superfluid by an infinitesimal attraction , but also the pairing gap is significantly enhanced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pairing_gap ] ) .",
    "in particular , we showed that the usual exponential dependence on the small coupling constant is promoted to the remarkable linear dependence as a consequence of magnetic catalysis .",
    "hopefully , our finding here may facilitate the realization of the pair superfluid in 2d by ultracold atom experiments .",
    "as for a future work , we plan to extend our study to finite temperature as well as to finite density imbalance between two different spin components of fermions .",
    "in particular , it was revealed in the absence of magnetic fields that the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state , where the cooper pairing takes place with nonzero momentum  @xcite , emerges in the phase diagram of an imbalanced 2d fermi gas  @xcite .",
    "it must be worthwhile to elucidate how the antiparallel magnetic fields compete or cooperate with the fflo state .",

    "<S> we study a two - dimensional fermi gas with an attractive interaction subjected to synthetic magnetic fields assumed to be mutually antiparallel for two different spin components . by employing the mean - field approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that its phase diagram at zero temperature consists of pair superfluid and quantum spin hall insulator phases and closely resembles that of the bose - hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting two phases are separated by a second - order quantum phase transition classified into the universality class of either the dilute bose gas or the xy model . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the pairing gap can be enhanced significantly by the antiparallel magnetic fields as a consequence of magnetic catalysis , which may facilitate the realization of the pair superfluid in two dimensions by ultracold atom experiments . </S>"
