    ", the quantum adiabatic algorithm has been shown to be @xmath2  @xcite , which is as powerful as grover s algorithm  @xcite and is quadratic speedup over the classical search algorithm .",
    "in general , the adiabatic algorithm has been shown to have the potential to solve np - hard problem  @xcite .",
    "in addition to its speed up against classical computing , the quantum adiabatic algorithm also has capacity to remain robust against environment noise  @xcite .",
    "some practical architectures for quantum adiabatic algorithms were proposed  @xcite ; in 2013 d - wave company claimed that they built a quantum computer based on quantum adiabatic algorithm  @xcite .    in quantum adiabatic algorithm , there are two types of computational errors .",
    "one is the extrinsic error , which is caused by the environment .",
    "the other is the intrinsic error : as the algorithm has to be run in a finite computation time @xmath1 , the adiabatic hamiltonian must change in a finite rate and this inevitably will induce transition to excited states and cause computational error .",
    "the intrinsic computational error depends entirely on how the adiabatic path @xmath0 is chosen .",
    "the most popular choice so far is the linear path , @xmath3 .",
    "other choices were proposed in literature  @xcite .",
    "people has also tried to optimize the adiabatic path @xmath0 using geometrization  @xcite .     according to the hierarchical theory of quantum adiabatic evolution  @xcite",
    ", the intrinsic error depends crucially on the time derivatives of @xmath0 at the beginning and the end of the evolution .",

    "we find that the cubic path is the best among the six chosen path and it can reduce the error by orders of magnitude compared to the popular linear path and sinusoidal path .    our paper is organized as follows : for the sake of self - containment , we first briefly introduce the quantum adiabatic algorithm , in particular , the quantum adiabatic search algorithm , and the hierarchical theory of quantum adiabatic evolution , respectively , in sections ii and iii . in section iv",

    "the adiabatic quantum computation was first introduced in 2000  @xcite based on the quantum adiabatic theorem  @xcite . in a quantum adiabatic algorithm , the solution of a problem is encoded into the ground state of the problem hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "an initial hamiltonian @xmath5 is chosen so that its ground state can be easily found and set up .",
    "the total adiabatic hamiltonian is constructed by linking the initial hamiltonian with the problem hamiltonian with a path as follows @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] is the adiabatic parameter .",
    "the system is prepared in the ground state of @xmath5 . as @xmath8 changes slowly from zero to one",
    ", the quantum adiabatic theorem ensures that the system stays in the ground state of @xmath9 and eventually arrives at the ground state of @xmath4 , the solution .    in the search problem ,",
    "the task is to locate @xmath10 marked items out of @xmath11 randomly arranged items . on a quantum computer ,",
    "we use a set of orthonormal basis @xmath12 to denote the @xmath11 unsorted items .",
    "the problem hamiltonian can be constructed as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the set of marked items .",
    "this hamiltonian is the projection operator to a subspace orthogonal to the subspace spanned by @xmath15 ; its ground state can be any state from subspace @xmath15 .",
    "if we choose the initial state to be equally contributed from the orthonormal basis as @xmath16 , then the initial hamiltonian is @xmath17 thus the quantum adiabatic hamiltonian for search is @xmath18    note that the unit of hamiltonian which rules the quantum computation depends on what kind of system is used for realization .",
    "suppose a system has a characteristic time @xmath19 ; the unit of hamiltonian is @xmath20 . for convenience , in the following derivation , we set @xmath21 .    in the above hamiltonian ,",
    "if @xmath0 changes from zero to one infinitely slowly , the system will stay strictly in the ground state and the solution can be found without any error if there is no environment noise .",
    "this is dictated by the quantum adiabatic theorem .",
    "however , we want to know the solution as fast as possible .",
    "this means that @xmath8 has to change from zero to one in a finite time @xmath1 , causing a small transition to excited states . at the end",
    ", there is an inevitable error in the solution . for the search problem",
    ", we define the intrinsic computational error as  @xcite @xmath22 where the projection operator @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 the main purpose of this work is to reduce the computational error @xmath25 by optimizing the adiabatic path @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest and also the most popular choice is the linear path @xmath26 .",
    "this is almost the worst among the easy choices , which includes sinusoidal path . according to the newly developed hierarchical theory of quantum adiabatic evolution  @xcite , the error @xmath25 depends crucially how the time derivatives of @xmath0 at the beginning and the end of the adiabatic evolution . in this work ,",
    "several adiabatic paths @xmath0 are designed and the errors caused by these paths are computed and compared to the error by the linear path . the error can be reduced by orders of magnitude .",
    "( color online)adiabatic evolution trajectories in the projective hilbert space .",
    "the red lines are the zeroth - order trajectories , that is , the trajectories follow strictly the quantum adiabatic theorem .",
    "the blue lines are the first - order trajectories , which are shifted from the zeroth - order ones by a small amount proportional to @xmath27 .",

    "the quantum adiabatic theorem was proved in 1928 by born and fock  @xcite .",
    "this theorem ensures that a system starting in the ground state will stay in the ground state when the adiabatic parameter @xmath8 changes slowly .",
    "however , this is mathematically true only when the changing rate of @xmath8 is infinitesimally small . in any practical situation , for example",
    ", quantum adiabatic computing , the adiabatic parameter @xmath8 has to change with a small but finite rate , this will cause a small transition to excited states , resulting a deviation from the quantum adiabatic theorem . in ref .",

    "the small shift is proportional to @xmath27 , the first - order time derivative of @xmath0 ; the small oscillating amplitude is determined by @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",

    ", we can set @xmath30 at the beginning . in this case",
    ", there are no oscillations and the system will follow a smooth first - order trajectory . as the shift between the first - order trajectory and the zeroth - order trajectory is proportional to @xmath27 , we can reduce the error @xmath25 in the first order to zero by choosing a @xmath0 such that @xmath30 at @xmath31 .",
    "for such a path @xmath0 , the error @xmath25 is of the second - order , determined by @xmath29 , the second - order time derivative of @xmath0 . to further reduce the error",

    "we note here that the crucial role played by the time derivatives was also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite with a different approach .",
    "let us come back to the search hamiltonian and see how the hierarchical theory outlined in the last section can be applied successfully to this problem .",
    "because of the permutation symmetry of the search hamiltonian @xmath9 , for the given initial state , the quantum state at any given time has the form  @xcite @xmath34 the schrdinger equation governing the search algorithm becomes @xmath35 with @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",

    "shows how the deviation from the ground state ( fixed point ) changes with time for linear path and sinusoidal path .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the deviations oscillate around the first - order analytical results . and the amplitude of this oscillation is conserved , which is an result of conservation of action@xcite .",

    "are deviation from the ground state . as the first - order derivative @xmath74 and @xmath75 are zero , the deviation is of second order and it oscillates around the analytical second - order deviation ( see the inset of fig.[second](a ) ) .",
    "to see these oscillations more clearly , we have plotted the difference between our numerical results and the analytical second - order deviation in fig.[second](b ) ) , where the oscillation pattern is seen to have a kink in the middle of the evolution . since the second order derivatives @xmath76 and @xmath77 are very small",
