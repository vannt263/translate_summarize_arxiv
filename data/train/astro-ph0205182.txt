    "ngc  7332 is an ordinary - looking galaxy that is peculiar in many aspects . a detailed study of its kinematics of gas , stars and its surface photometry has shown that it is a rosetta stone that can teach us what the components are that galaxies consist of , and how they form .",
    "the galaxy is a highly inclinated s0 located close to the spiral galaxy ngc  7339 at 5.2@xmath0 with a similar systemic velocity .",
    "previous papers on this galaxy include those by fisher , illingworth , & franx ( 1994 ) and plana & boulesteix 1996 ) . while the main results of fisher et al .",
    "include the b / d decomposition of the galaxy , as well as an analysis of its stellar and gaseous kinematics , plana & boulesteix focus exclusively on determining the gas morphology of the galaxy from h@xmath1 emission maps .",
    "fisher et al .",
    "show that the galaxy has kinematics fairly typical of a stellar disk , with a counter - rotating and a fainter co - rotating gas disk .",
    "an extension of this result was found by plana & boulesteix who not only mapped the distribution of the 2 gaseous components , but also modelled them , finding different inclination angles for each component .",
    "broad band colours ( balcells & peletier 1994 ) show that the colours of ngc  7332 ( @xmath2 ) are somewhat bluer than colours of elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity .",
    "this is confirmed by a spectral analysis showing that the galaxy has a luminosity weighted age of about 6 gyr ( vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ) .",
    "here we present 2 studies aimed at understanding the difference between ngc  7332 and ordinary red s0 galaxies .",
    "first we present a new study of the position of this galaxy on the fundamental plane ( fp ) of early - type galaxies ( for details see falcn - barroso et al .",
    "we show that ngc 7332 lies below the relation , and that the displacement can not explained by uncertainties in our measurements .",
    "second , we show new 2d maps of the stellar and the gaseous kinematics in the [ oiii ] 5007   line obtained with sauron .",
    "we have studied the position of 19 galactic bulges ( the sample of peletier et al .",
    "1999 ) on the fp in both b and k , with the aim of finding out whether bulges are formed in the same way as ellipticals .",
    "we find that bulges are slightly shifted with respect to the fp defined by ellipticals .",
    "this is explained easily by the fact that the sample consists of galaxies with inclination @xmath3 50@xmath4 , together with the contribution of the rotating disk , which causes the velocity dispersion of a bulge to be slightly lower than an elliptical of the same mass .",
    "ngc  7332 , however , lies significantly further below the fp .",
    "not only is this the case in the b - band , where such a deviation can be explained if the galaxy is much younger than other bulges , but also in k , where young stellar populations can not cause such a deviation . at this stage of our analysis",
    "we do not have a satisfactory reason why this galaxy is departing so strongly from the fp relation .",
    "ngc  7332 is the only s0 galaxy that we know which deviates so strongly , without being obviously interacting ( see e.g. schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) .",
    "another peculiarity of this galaxy is that the stellar colours in this galaxy are so homogeneous , with only a very small blueing towards the outer parts ( balcells & peletier 1994 ; fisher et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in fig .  1 we show the location of our sample of bulges on the fp of early - type galaxies as defined by jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1996 ( in the b - band , top panel ) and pahre et al 1998 ( in k - band , bottom panel ) .",
    "we have marked ngc  7332 with an open circle .",
    "ngc  7332 s kinematics reveals a smooth uniform stellar velocity field rotating along the minor axis of the galaxy ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the velocity field appears consistent with cylindrical rotation , although this result will have to be confirmed with some detailed modeling .",
    "the velocity dispersion map shows a dip along the major axis of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "this is usually the case when a galaxy has an inner disk .",
    "indeed , for ngc  7332 such an inner disk in the first @xmath5 5 arcsec has been discovered by seifert & scorza ( 1996 ) .",
    "the higher order moments gauss - hermite moments(h@xmath6 , h@xmath7 , van der marel & franx 1993 ) seem to be regular , which means that it is unlikely that the galaxy harbours multiple stellar disks , like e.g. in ngc  4550 ( rubin et al .",
    "in order to obtain the kinematics of the gas , we need to separate emission from absorption lines . to do this we used a small variation to a more sophisticated technique ( see de zeeuw et al . 2002 ) and subtracted the stellar spectrum by fitting the observed stellar energy distribution outside the region of the emission lines with synthetic templates from the models of vazdekis ( 1999 ) for composite single age / metallicity models of various ages and metallicities .",
    "this procedure can be summarize in a few steps :    * we first derive the stellar kinematics ( @xmath8 ) using the method of van der marel & franx ( 1993 ) with a single stellar population ( ssp ) model as template .",
    "* second , we build a library of models with different ages and metallicities ( ssp models from vazdekis 1999 ) .",
    "* we convolve the spectra of the library with the losvds obtained in step 1 . *",
    "we then fit a linear combination of these ssp models to the galaxy spectrum . *",
    "finally we substract the fitted spectrum from the observed sed to obtain a pure emission - line spectrum .    using this method",
    "it is possible to recover faint emission line profiles , as seen at the ni doublet at 5199 (log @xmath93.718 ) in figures ( 8 & 9 ) .",
    "this is without doubt the most unusual feature in ngc  7332 . a close inspection of the [ oiii ] ( 5007  ) gas emission lines shows a primary , counter - rotating gas disk ( figs .  4 & 5 ) and a much fainter secondary component ( figs .  6 & 7 ) corotating with respect to the stellar component",
    "this double component has been detected also by plana & boulesteix ( 1996 ) from h@xmath1 observations . in general , both plana and",
    "we find the same spatial distribution of the second component .",
    "the spatial distribution of the emission in [ oiii ] , however , is not the same as that of h@xmath1 . while we find very little oiii emission in the center of the galaxy , plana & boulesteix find a considerable amount of h@xmath1 .",
    "trying to understand why this is the case , we have analysed long - slit data , in the h@xmath1 region , from the ing ( isaac newton group ) archive . these data , obtained in june 1994 by merrifield & kuijken ,",
    "reveal that h@xmath1 in the center is weak contrary to the results of plana & boulesteix .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that h@xmath10 in our sauron data is weak as well , casting doubt upon the results of plana & boulesteix .",
    "further analysis about this subject is due to appear in a forthcoming paper .",
    "* ngc  7332 is an unusual object . * as yet it is a miracle why this galaxy lies so far away from the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies * its stellar kinematics is not peculiar at all . *",
    "the existence of two gaseous components coexisting with opposite angular momentum leaves the hypothesis open of a recent merger scenario in ngc  7332 .",
    "we thank the sauron team for obtaining and reducing the data of ngc  7332 .",
    "the william herschel telescope is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
