    "it has been reported that such `` hot '' spots can be localized within @xmath0  nm or less .",
    "this along with a great sensitivity to initial conditions and geometry makes plasmonic structures so attractable for atom / molecule manipulations .    a natural combination of nanoplasmonics and molecular response to the generated field started to appear as molecular nanopolaritonics,@xcite which studies molecular influence on field propagation , and as a tool for developing molecular switches.@xcite the latter utilizes nonadiabatic alignment of a molecule on semiconductor surface under a tip of scanning tunneling microscope .",
    "recent developments in experimental techniques capable of measuring optical response of current - carrying molecular junctions@xcite lead to theoretical formulations suitable for simultaneous description of both transport and optical properties of molecular devices.@xcite    while experimental data are measured in real time , theoretical description of both transport and optical response so far has mostly been focused on a steady - state description .",
    "time - dependent transport usually is treated either within kinetic theory@xcite or within time - dependent density functional approach.@xcite the former generally misses broadening of molecular states due to coupling to macroscopic contacts@xcite and information on coherence,@xcite although interesting generalizations started to appear.@xcite limitations of the latter are due to absence of developed pseudopotentials and fundamental necessity to treat finite ( closed ) systems ( see e.g. ref .   for discussion ) .",
