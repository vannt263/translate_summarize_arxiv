    "recent progress in experimental systems biology provides us with an unprecedented amount of genome - wide protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) data  @xcite . in order to obtain a deeper insight into the molecular machinery behind these interactions ,",
    "many network models have been proposed to study or model ppi evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , ppi networks of extant organisms are only snapshots of network evolution , and inferring the whole network evolution history remains a challenging problem in computational biology  @xcite .",
    "unlike many networks studied in technology and sociology , the main growth mechanism of ppi network is gene duplication and divergence  @xcite : when a new node is added to the network , it copies all the interactions of an existing node designed as the anchor node ; subsequently some edges adjacent to one of these two nodes are randomly lost .",
    "this mechanism was explicitly converted to a network growth model by vazquez et al . in  @xcite . since then many extensions have been put forth , see for examples , @xcite . here",
    "we shall focus on a particular one called duplication - mutation with complementarity ( dmc ) , which is the best model to fit the _ d. melanogaster _ ( fruit fly ) ppi network according to a recent study by middendorf et al .",
    ".    when a growth model is fixed , the problem of reconstructing the evolutionary history of an observed network is to infer the relative order of the nodes according to which the network evolved ( see section  [ sec : hist ] for definitions ) . better understanding of this problem can provide further insights into not only how ppi networks are formed , but also how they will possibly evolve in the future .",
    "several approaches to address this problem have been proposed in recent years . in order to obtain better ways of predicting protein modules , dutkowski and tiuryn introduced a bayesian network framework to infer the posterior probability of interactions between ancestral nodes based on a duplication and speciation model  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was used by pinney  @xcite to infer ancestral interactions between bzip proteins .",
    "gibson and goldberg proposed a merging algorithm to reconstruct the evolutionary history of ppi networks using gene trees  @xcite . a novel framework for estimating the topology of the ancestral networks based on maximal likelihood was presented by navlakha and kingsford in  @xcite .",
    "recently , patro et al .",
    "@xcite used a maximal parsimony approach that appends edges in observed networks to duplication history forest .    here",
    "we introduce a new history inferring framework based on the maximal likelihood principle .",
    "in contrast to the model - based methods in  @xcite , our approach incorporates not only the topology of observed networks , but also the duplication history of the proteins contained in the networks .",
    "although the evolution of topology is often determined by some growth mechanisms , the duplication history of the proteins can be inferred independently by phylogenetic studies  @xcite . after establishing some theoretical results concerning the dmc model , we reduce the problem of finding most probable history of ancient networks to an optimization problem , and propose some efficient heuristic algorithms to solve the latter problem .",
    "simulations show that our method provides better inference than the ones in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we also applied our algorithm to the ppi networks of _ s. cerevisiae _",
    "( budding yeast ) , _",
    "d. melanogaster _ and _ c. elegans _",
    "( worm ) , and the growth parameters obtained by our approach are more consistent with the ones predicted in  @xcite . finally , we also propose an improved measure for comparing two histories .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : method ] provides the framework of reconstruction , including the technical background and the inference method . in section [ sec : result ] we present the inference results for simulations and real data sets .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discuss ] with a brief discussion and some possible related research directions .",
    "in the dmc model @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the two parameters that specify the model , we start with an initial graph @xmath3 , the so - called seed graph . at each time",
    "step @xmath4 , the graph @xmath5 is obtained from @xmath6 by the following procedures ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dmc ] for an illustration ) : ( 1 ) ( duplication ) a node @xmath7 is chosen uniformly at random from the set of nodes in @xmath6 , and a new node @xmath8 is added and connected to every neighbor of @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath8 are often referred to as the anchor node and duplicate node at step @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "( 2 ) ( mutation ) for each neighbor of @xmath9 , say @xmath10 , we choose one edge from @xmath11 and @xmath12 with equal probability , and this chosen edge is deleted with probability @xmath13 .",
    "( 3 ) ( complementarity ) the nodes @xmath9 and @xmath8 are connected with probability @xmath1 .",
    "note that the dmc model is markovian , that is , the probability of obtaining @xmath5 when @xmath6 is given depends solely on the parameters of @xmath14 .",
    "for example , denoting the network ( a ) and ( d ) in fig  [ fig : dmc ] by @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively , then the probability @xmath15 that @xmath5 is evolved from @xmath6 by one step under the model @xmath14 is @xmath16 .      given an observed network @xmath17 , a _ growth history _",
    "@xmath18 of @xmath17 is a graph sequence @xmath19 such that @xmath20 and for each index @xmath4 in @xmath21 , the graph @xmath5 can be obtained from @xmath6 in one step under the dmc model @xmath14 .",
    "the first graph @xmath3 is referred to as the seed graph of the history . in addition , the number @xmath22 is called the _ span _ of the history .",
    "clearly , a history @xmath18 induces a unique sequence @xmath23 of duplicate nodes , that is , @xmath24 such that for all @xmath4 , node @xmath8 is the unique node in @xmath5 , but not @xmath6 .    given a network @xmath17 ,",
    "let @xmath18 be the growth history we hope to infer .",
    "the probability of @xmath17 being evolved according to history @xmath18 , when viewed as a function of the unknown history @xmath18 , is called the _ likelihood function _ @xmath25 that is given by @xmath26    we adopt a maximal likelihood approach to infer the history of @xmath17 as below .",
    "given a network @xmath17 together with a natural number @xmath22 and model @xmath14 , construct a growth history @xmath18 that maximizes the likelihood @xmath25 among all histories with span @xmath22 .",
    "this problem is expected to be difficult since the number of possible histories grows exponentially , and we are not aware of any results concerning whether this problem is polynomial - time solvable . before introducing a variant of the above problem that is more tractable , we present some necessary tools in the following two subsections .",
    "we begin with duplication history , which is closely related to network history as gene duplication is a major driving force of ppi network evolution  @xcite .",
    "the idea of encoding the duplication history by a forest of binary tree was used in  @xcite .",
    "patro et al .",
    "@xcite incorporated duplication history in a parsimony approach to reconstruct network history . a growth history @xmath18 of a ppi network induces a unique duplication forest .",
    "initially , we have a forest @xmath27 consisting of isolated nodes that are identical to the set of nodes in the seed graph . at each step",
    "@xmath4 , the forest @xmath28 is obtained from @xmath29 by replacing the anchor node @xmath9 with a cherry @xmath30 consisting of @xmath9 and the duplicate node @xmath8 . here",
    "a _ cherry _",
    "@xmath31 is referred to a subtree consisting of two leaves @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the internal node adjacent to them .",
    "the duplication forest of a ppi network can also be inferred independently without using its growth history .",
    "for instance , such a forest can be reconstructed by the phylogenetic relationships between the genes in the network  @xcite .",
    "this observation is key to our investigation .      in this subsection",
    ", we will introduce a backward operator that is important in our inference framework .",
    "consider one step in a growth history , that is , a graph @xmath5 obtained from @xmath6 in one step by using anchor node @xmath9 and duplicate node @xmath8 .",
    "now we want to define a backward operator @xmath34 such that @xmath6 can be determined by this operator and the triplet @xmath35 . to this end , let @xmath36 be the graph obtained from @xmath5 by merging the two nodes @xmath9 and @xmath8 in @xmath5 , that is , ( i ) for each neighbor @xmath10 of @xmath8 such that @xmath37 and @xmath10 is not adjacent to @xmath9 , add an edge @xmath38 ; ( ii ) delete the node @xmath8 and all edges incident to it .",
    "similarly , the backward operator can be applied to the duplication forest , that is , @xmath39 is the forest obtained from @xmath28 by replacing the cherry @xmath30 with the leaf @xmath9 . note that this definition is consistent with the above one in the following sense : if @xmath28 is the duplication forest corresponding to the network @xmath5 , then @xmath39 is the duplication forest associated with @xmath40 .",
    "when the anchor node @xmath9 is clear from the context , we also write @xmath41 for @xmath42 .      using the backward operator introduced above",
    ", we shall introduce a scheme to represent a growth history with known duplication forest by a node sequence . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the convention that a node sequence consists of distinct nodes , while a node list may contain repeated nodes .    in general , a node sequence @xmath24 and a duplication forest @xmath43",
    "are said to be _ compatible _ if there exists a ( necessarily unique ) sequence @xmath44 of forests such that @xmath45 , and @xmath46 holds for each @xmath47 .",
    "note that a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath48 and @xmath43 being compatible is that @xmath8 belongs to a cherry in @xmath49 for each @xmath4 . denoting the sibling of @xmath8 in @xmath49 , that is , the unique leaf in @xmath28 that forms a cherry with @xmath8 , by @xmath9",
    ", we say the list @xmath50 is the _ anchor _ list determined by @xmath43 and @xmath48 .",
    "as mentioned above , a growth history @xmath51 specifies a duplicate sequence @xmath24 and a duplication forest @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , the sequence @xmath48 and forest @xmath43 must be compatible .",
    "on the other hand , given a duplication forest @xmath43 associated with a network @xmath17 and a sequence @xmath48 that is compatible with @xmath43 , then there exists a unique growth history @xmath18 such that @xmath48 is induced from @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , when the duplication forest @xmath43 is fixed , a growth history @xmath18 is uniquely determined by the duplicate sequence @xmath48 associated with it . in this context , the likelihood function is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the probability that @xmath54 is evolved from @xmath55 in one step under the dmc model @xmath14 and using the anchor node @xmath9 specified by @xmath48 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that in general the probability @xmath53 is different from @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , the latter can be regarded as an  average \" of the former over all possible anchor nodes .",
    "now , the problem of inferring growth history with given duplication forest , a variant of problem 1 that will be studied in this paper , can be formally stated as below .",
    "given a network @xmath17 together with a duplication forest @xmath43 and a growth model @xmath14 , construct a duplicate sequence @xmath48 such that the likelihood @xmath57 is maximized .    in the above problem ,",
    "the parameters in the dmc model @xmath14 are specifically mentioned . however , as we shall see later , the parameters of @xmath14 are not needed for the history inference problem .      here",

    "the first one is a greedy algorithm called minimal loss number ( mln ) , in which we choose a duplicate node with the smallest value @xmath77 among all candidate ones .    to motivate our main reconstruction algorithm , we introduce some further notation and results .",

    "note that in general the relation @xmath95 is not transitive , that is , @xmath93 and @xmath96 does not imply @xmath97 .",
    "now we present our main inference algorithm called cherry greedy ( cg ) , which runs as follows : at every backward reconstruction step , we choose a node from the most favorable cherry @xmath98 , that is , the number of cherries @xmath99 with @xmath100 is maximized .",
    "if several cherries are equally favorable , we uniformly choose one of them .",

    "since the above algorithm is a stochastic one , that is , among a chosen cherry @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 has the equal probability of being chosen as the duplicate node .",
    "therefore , one natural way of improving its accuracy is to repeat the algorithm for a certain times and report the best output , where the number of repetitions can be regarded as a tuning parameter . when the real duplicate sequence @xmath107 is known , the best one is defined as the output @xmath48 such that kendall s @xmath108 between @xmath107 and @xmath48 is maximized ( see section 3 for further details on kendall s @xmath108 ) , otherwise the one with the smallest loss number is chosen .",
