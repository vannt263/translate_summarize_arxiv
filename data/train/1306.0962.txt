    "as an introduction we briefly review the theory of integrable systems and give an overview of the preceding research . there exist various distinct notions referred to under the name of ` integrable ' systems in mathematics and mathematical physics .",
    "however , we can state without accuracy that the differential equations are ` integrable ' if they are highly symmetric and have sufficiently ` many ' first integrals ( conserved quantities ) so that the integration of them is possible .    in the middle of the 19th century ,",
    "j. liouville first defined the notion of ` exact integrability ' of hamiltonian systems of classical mechanics in terms of poisson commuting invariants @xcite .",
    "let us consider a hamiltonian @xmath2 with @xmath3-degree of freedom which is analytic in @xmath4 .",
    "the hamilton equations are @xmath5    the hamiltonian @xmath6 is liouville integrable if there exist @xmath3 independent analytic first integrals @xmath7 in involution @xmath8i.e . @xmath9 .    in the late 1960s ,",
    "the localized solutions of partial differential equations have been found to be understood by viewing these equations as infinite dimensional integrable systems .",
    "these localized solutions are called solitons .",
    "the classical example of solitons is a solution of the korteweg - de vries equation ( kdv equation ) which describes shallow water wave phenomena @xcite .",
    "the discovery of solitary wave solutions dates back to the 1830s . in 1834",
    ", scott russell discovered a solitary wave phenomenon while observing the motion of a boat in a canal .",
    "he noticed that the speed of the waves depends on their size , and that these waves will never merge  a large wave overtakes a small one @xcite .",
    "later in 1895 , korteweg and de vries proved that these waves can be simulated by the solutions of the following partial differential equation which is now called the kdv equation : @xmath10 the kdv equation became increasingly important when it was discovered that the equation can simulate many physical phenomena such as plasma physics and internal waves .",
    "zabusky and kruskal found that the kdv equation was the governing equation of the fermi - pasta - ulam lattice equation , and that the solutions of the kdv equation pass through one another and subsequently retain their characteristic form and velocity @xcite .",
    "it has later been discovered that these soliton equations can be understood from a broader perspective . in 1980s , m. sato and y. sato discovered that wide class of nonlinear integrable equations and their solutions can be treated uniformly by considering them on an infinite dimensional grassmannian @xcite .",
    "this is the notable ` sato theory ' , in which the sato equation is a ` master ' equation that produces an infinite series of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "the theory is also called the theory of the kp hierarchies , since one of the simplest equations among those series of equations is the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( kp equation ) , which describes shallow water waves of dimension two : @xmath11 the kdv equation and its soliton solutions are proved to be obtained from the reduction of the kp equation and its soliton solutions .",
    "next we review another important class of integrable differential equations : the painlev equations .",
    "the painlev equations were originally discovered by p. painlev and b. gambier as second order ordinary differential equations whose solutions do not have movable singularities other than poles . @xcite .",
    "let us consider the differential equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a rational function of @xmath14 whose coefficients are analytic functions of @xmath15 defined on some domain @xmath16 .",
    "if the equation does not have movable singular points , then it falls into one of the following cases :    * linear equations .",
    "* equations of the form @xmath17 their solutions are written by the weierstra   elliptic function .",
    "* solvable equations .",
    "* one of the six painlev equations ( p , p , p@xmath18 , p@xmath19 , p@xmath20 , p@xmath21 ) . we just present the first two of the painlev equations : * * painlev i equation ( p ) @xmath22 * * painlev ii equation ( p ) @xmath23 @xmath24    in the 1970s , it has been found that the correlation function of the two - dimensional ising model are related to the painlev iii equation @xcite , and since then the painlev equations have been investigated eagerly as one of the classes of integrable equations by k. okamoto and many other researchers .",
    "also , the painlev equations can be obtained via similarity reduction of some soliton equations .",
    "we review some of the topics on the integrability of discretized equations . roughly speaking , the discrete integrable systems have ` many ' conserved quantities and soliton solutions . if the discretization is chosen appropriately , the discrete system preserves the essential properties that the corresponding continuous system possesses .",
    "a discrete version of the kp equation is derived via the miwa transformation from the kp hierarchy .",
    "the miwa transformation is the following transformation that changes the variables @xmath25 to @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are distinct constants .",
    "let us suppose that the variables @xmath30 take only integer values , and consider a function @xmath31 , which is a miwa transformation of the @xmath32-function solution @xmath33 of the sato s bilinear identity .",
    "then we obtain the following bilinear relation for distinct @xmath34 : @xmath35 the equation is the discrete kp equation , and is also called ` hirota - miwa equation ' .",
    "the discrete kdv equation is obtained by imposing a restriction @xmath36 to the hirota - miwa equation .",
    "this kind of restriction on the independent variables ( imposing shift invariance , omitting some of the variables , e.t.c . ) to construct simpler classes of equations is called the ` reduction ' .",
    "it gives the following bilinear form of the discrete kdv equation : @xmath37 here @xmath38 .",
    "( note that , in this paper , the word ` reduction ' is also used to indicate other process : the projection modulo a maximal ideal . ) by introducing a new variable @xmath39 we obtain the discrete kdv equation as the following nonlinear partial difference equation : @xmath40 in 1990 , the discrete versions of the painlev equations have been discovered by a. ramani , b. grammaticos and j. hietarinta @xcite .",
    "they are considered to be integrable in the sense that they pass the singularity confinement test .",
    "the singularity confinement test judges whether the spontaneously appearing singularities disappear after a few iteration steps of the systems .",
    "for example , let us consider the following mapping related to the discrete painlev i equation : @xmath41 if we evolve the equation from @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then we have @xmath44 thus @xmath45 is indeterminate . however , if we introduce a small positive parameter @xmath46 and take @xmath47 , then @xmath48 @xmath49 by taking the limit @xmath50 , we obtain the time evolution as follows : @xmath51 in this case we can see that , by introducing a parameter @xmath52 in the initial value , the indeterminacy resulting from the singularity at @xmath43 is ` confined ' within finite time steps and then the initial value @xmath53 reappears .",
    "most integrable discrete systems have been proved to pass the test @xcite .",
    "we will treat some of the discrete painlev equations in the following sections .",
    "note that , although the singularity confinement test is a very powerful tool to detect the integrability of many discrete equations , it is not easy to apply the test to partial difference equations . in 2014 , after this thesis is submitted , the author and his collaborators invented a new integrability criterion called ` co - primeness ' condition , which can be considered as one type of generalization of the singularity confinement test .",
    "the benefit of the co - primeness is that it is applicable also to the partial difference equations , however , we do not treat this topic in this article and leave the details to other papers .",
    "the ultra - discrete integrable systems are obtained from the discrete integrable ones through a limiting procedure called ` ultra - discretization ' .",
    "both the dependent and independent variables of the ultra - discrete systems take discrete values , usually the integers .",
    "therefore they are considered as cellular automata .",
    "the cellular automaton is a discrete computational model which consists of a regular grid of cells .",
    "each cell has a finite number of states , corresponding to the value of the independent variable of the ultra - discrete system .",
    "it is studied not only in mathematical physics , but also in many fields in natural and social sciences such as computability theory , theoretical biology and jamology .",
    "one of the most famous cellular automata may be the elementary cellular automata ( eca ) @xcite .",
    "it is one - dimensional and the time evolution of a cell depends only on its two neighboring cells .",
    "we give an eca with ` rule @xmath54 ' , which is the ` simplest non - trivial ' eca as an example @xcite . let the values of one - dimensional cells at time step @xmath55 be @xmath56 where each cell satisfies @xmath57 .",
    "the next step @xmath58 is defined as the exclusive disjunction of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and therefore be expressed as @xmath61 .",
    "the time evolution on a large scale gives the shape of the sierpiski gasket , a fractal .",
    "see the figure [ figuresier ] .     of the eca with rule @xmath54 , where the dot ` . '",
    "denotes @xmath62.,width=340 ]    we are also interested in more complex cellular automata whose solutions behave analogous to those of some discrete integrable systems .",
    "we present one way to ultradiscretize the discrete kdv equation and explain how this limiting procedure gives the box ball systems ( bbs ) .",
    "the bbs is one of the typical soliton cellular automata discovered by d. takahashi and j. satsuma , and has been investigated extensively by t. tokihiro et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "to simplify the process , we use the following lemma :    under the boundary condition @xmath63 , the discrete kdv equation takes the following form : @xmath64    to ultradiscretize the equation , we first introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath65 and change variables as @xmath66 by taking the logarithms of the both sides of , we have @xmath67 by taking the limit @xmath68 , and by using the identities @xmath69 and @xmath70 which are true for all @xmath71 , we obtain the evolution equation of the bbs : @xmath72 here the parameter @xmath73 is called the ` capacity of the box ' . in particular , if @xmath74 the bbs evolves inside of @xmath75 .",
    "we give an example of the time evolution in the figure [ figurebbs ] .     of the bbs , where a dot ` . '",
    "indicates a zero.,width=415 ]    this solution corresponds to the three - soliton solution of the ( continuous and discrete ) kdv equation . the origin of the name ` box ball ' system is that the solution of bbs can be seen as moving balls @xmath76s@xmath77 in an infinite array of empty boxes @xmath78s@xmath77 .",
    "note that taking the ultra - discrete limit is closely related to taking the @xmath0-adic valuation of the given discrete equations as pointed out by s. matsutani @xcite .",
    "we will look into this approach in more detail at the end of the paper .",
    "finally let us note on another topic on ultra - discrete equations .",
    "the ultra - discrete analogs of the painlev equation have been studied recently .",
    "for example , an ultra - discrete version of the @xmath1-painlev ii equation has been obtained through ` ultra - discretization with parity variables ' @xcite , which is a generalized method of ultra - discretization , and its special solution has been obtained . in connection with this theory of extended ultra - discretization procedure , n. mimura et .",
    "al . proposed an ultra - discrete version of the singularity confinement test @xcite .",
    "another type of singularity confinement test for ultra - discrete equation has been proposed by n. joshi and s. lafortune , where the ` singularities ' for the max - plus equations have been introduced as the non - differentiable points of the piecewise linear functions @xcite .      in this section",
    "let us summarize the definition of the field of @xmath0-adic numbers and briefly explain the ` good ' reduction .",
    "let @xmath0 be a prime number .",
    "a non - zero rational number @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) can be written uniquely as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath53 and @xmath83 are coprime integers neither of which is divisible by @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath84 the @xmath0-adic valuation of @xmath15 . the @xmath0-adic norm @xmath85 is defined as",
    "@xmath86 the local field @xmath87 is a completion of @xmath88 with respect to the @xmath0-adic norm .",
    "it is called the field of @xmath0-adic numbers , and its subring @xmath89 is called the ring of @xmath0-adic integers @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-adic norm satisfies a special inequality @xmath90    the absolute value @xmath91 of a valued field @xmath92 is non - archimedean ( or also called ultrametric ) if the following estimate is satisfied for all @xmath93 : @xmath94    the @xmath0-adic norm @xmath95 of @xmath96 is thus non - archimedean , and the field @xmath96 is a non - archimedean field .",
    "let @xmath97 be the maximal ideal of @xmath98 .",
    "we define the reduction of @xmath15 modulo @xmath99 as @xmath100 we write @xmath101 as @xmath102 for simplicity .",
    "note that the reduction is a ring homomorphism : @xmath103 the element @xmath104 is uniquely written as the @xmath0-adic polynomial series : @xmath105 where each @xmath106 .",
    "the reduction is naturally computed as @xmath107 .",
    "the reduction map @xmath108 is generalized to @xmath109 : @xmath110 which is no longer homomorphic .",
    "the element @xmath111 is uniquely expanded as the laurent series using @xmath112 : @xmath113 where each @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in this case , the reduction is @xmath116 . for a dynamical system",
    "@xmath117 consisting of two rational mappings defined over @xmath118 : @xmath119 the ` reduced ' system @xmath120 is defined as the system whose coefficients are all reduced to @xmath121 : @xmath122 we define the notion of ` good reduction ' , which basically means that the time evolution of the system and the reduction modulo @xmath99 commutes .",
    "[ grdef ] the rational system @xmath117 has a _ good reduction _ modulo @xmath99 on the domain @xmath123 if we have @xmath124 for any @xmath125 .",
    ".,width=302 ]    it is equivalent for the diagram in the figure [ figuregr ] to be commutative .",
    "originally , the good reduction was defined for a rational mapping with one variable @xcite .",
    "a rational map @xmath126 defined over the valued field @xmath92 is said to have good reduction modulo @xmath99 if @xmath127 .",
    "a map with a good reduction satisfies the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath126 be a rational map that has good reduction .",
    "then the map @xmath117 satisfies @xmath128 for all @xmath129 .    with this property in mind , we define the good reduction for the dynamical systems with two variables as satisfying @xmath128 ( definition [ grdef ] ) .",
    "the purpose of our research is to define and investigate the discrete integrable equations over finite fields .",
    "we wish to study the implication of integrability over finite fields .",
    "we also expect to construct cellular automata directly from the discrete systems over finite fields .    in the case of linear discrete equations , for example",
    ", we can well - define the equations over finite fields just by changing the field on which the equations are defined to finite fields .",
    "however , in the case of nonlinear equations , since the systems are usually formulated by rational functions , the division by @xmath130 mod @xmath0 and some indeterminacies such as @xmath131 and @xmath132 frequently appear .",
    "these points makes it difficult for us to well - define the equations over finite fields .",
    "thus there has been few studies on the nonlinear discrete integrable equations defined over finite fields .",
    "there are mainly three approaches to overcome this difficulty .",
    "( a ) the first one is to study the equation that does not contain division terms .",
    "santini et .",
    "al . studied cellular automata constructed from one type of the scrdinger equations which is free from division @xcite .",
    "bilinear form of the discrete kp and kdv equations , have been treated over the finite field @xmath133 and their soliton solutions over @xmath133 are obtained @xcite .",
    "( b ) the second one is to restrict the domain of definition of the system so that the indeterminacies do not appear . the discrete toda equation over finite fields and its graphical structures",
    "have been obtained @xcite .",
    "roberts and vivaldi studied the integrability over finite fields in terms of the lengths of the periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "( c ) the third one is to extend the space of initial conditions to make the mapping well - defined .",
    "we investigate this third approach in this paper and try two different schemes .",
    "( c - i ) the first scheme is to apply the sakai s theory on discrete painlev equations to the case of finite domains . according to the theory developed by k. okamoto and h. sakai ,",
    "the space of initial conditions for the discrete painlev equation becomes a birational surface as we extend the domain @xmath134 by blowing - up at each singular point @xcite .",
    "we show , in chapter [ sec3 ] , that this procedure is still valid if applied to the finite domain of definition @xmath135 .",
    "we in particular treated the discrete painlev ii equation , and presented the extended domain of initial conditions for @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "what is more , we have shown that the size of the extended domain we construct is smaller than that made by the sakai theory . since the domain over the finite field has a discrete topology , the extended domain need not to be birational , but needs only to be bijective .",
    "( c - ii ) the second scheme of extension is to define the equations over the field of @xmath0-adic numbers @xmath96 and then reduce them to the finite field @xmath133 . through this approach",
    ", we wish to establish the significance of ` integrability ' of the systems over finite fields .",
    "for example , if we try to define the discrete painlev equations over the field @xmath121 , the initial value space is a finite set @xmath138 .",
    "since the system consists of transitions between just @xmath139 points , it is not clear how we can formulate the integrability of the system from the integrability of the original system defined over @xmath140 or @xmath141 . to resolve this problem we consider a pair of fields @xmath142 in chapter [ chapter3 ] .",
    "we can say that the system over @xmath121 is ` integrable ' if it is integrable over @xmath87 and its reduction to the finite field @xmath121 has an ` almost good reduction ' property .",
    "we prove that , although the integrable mappings generally do not have a good reduction modulo a prime , they do have an",
    "_ almost good reduction _",
    "( agr ) , which is a generalized notion of good reduction .",
    "we demonstrate that agr can be used as an integrability detector over finite fields , by proving that dp,@xmath1p , @xmath1p , @xmath1p@xmath143 , @xmath1p@xmath144 and @xmath1p@xmath145 equations have agr over appropriate domains .",
    "we also prove that one of the chaotic system , the hietarinta - viallet equation , has agr and conclude that agr is an arithmetic analog of the singularity confinement method .",
    "we then discuss the relation of our approach to the diophantine integrability proposed by r. halburd @xcite .",
    "we also propose a way to reduce the systems defined over the extended field of @xmath96 , and then apply the procedure to obtain the cellular automaton from the complex - valued equations .",
    "lastly , in chapter [ sec5 ] , we apply our methods to the soliton systems , in particular the discrete kdv equation and one of its generalized forms @xcite .",
    "we present two methods of extension : first one is to use a field of rational functions whose coefficients are in the finite field , and the second one is to use the field of @xmath0-adic numbers just like we have done in the previous sections .",
    "the soliton solutions obtained through both two methods are introduced and their periodicity is discussed .",
    "special types of solitary waves that appear only over the finite fields are presented and their nature is studied .",
    "the reduction properties of the two - dimensional lattice systems are discussed .",
    "let us summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "the key definition is definition [ agrdef ] , in which almost good reduction property for non - autonomous discrete dynamical systems is formulated .",
    "the main theorems of this paper are the followings : theorem [ thminit ] on the space of initial conditions , and theorems [ propqrt ] , [ propdp2 ] , [ propqp1 ] , [ propqp2 ] , [ propqp3 ] , [ propqp4 ] , [ propqp5 ] , [ prophv ] on the almost good reduction property for discrete painlev equations .",
    "a discrete painlev equation is a non - autonomous and nonlinear second order ordinary difference equation with several parameters .",
    "when it is defined over a finite field , the dependent variable takes only a finite number of values and its time evolution will attain an indeterminate state in many cases for generic values of the parameters and initial conditions .",
    "for example , the discrete painlev ii equation ( dpequation ) is defined as @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are constant parameters @xcite .",
    "let @xmath149 for a prime @xmath0 and a positive integer @xmath150 .",
    "when is defined over a finite field @xmath151 , the dependent variable @xmath152 will eventually take values @xmath153 for generic parameters and initial values @xmath154 , and we can not proceed to evolve it . if we extend the domain from @xmath155 to @xmath156 , @xmath157 is not a field and we can not define arithmetic operation in . to determine its time evolution consistently , we have two choices : one is to restrict the parameters and the initial values to a smaller domain so that the singularities do not appear .",
    "the other is to extend the domain on which the equation is defined . in this article",

    "does not have period 12 ( for example @xmath883 ) while almost all other points do have this periodicity .",
    "calculated in two different ways ( left : @xmath867 , right : @xmath884 ) , where @xmath885 .",

    "we see that all points have periods 12 .",
    "it is important to determine how to reduce values in @xmath888 to values in @xmath157 , depending on the properties one wishes the soliton solutions to possess .      instead of dealing with the systems over the field of rational functions",

    "the calculation of soliton solutions and its reduction to the finite field can be done exactly the same as in section [ section51 ] .",
    "we can define the time evolution of the discrete kdv equation over the field of @xmath0-adic numbers @xmath87 , and then obtain the time evolution of the equation over @xmath398 by reducing it .",
    "one of the good thing about this approach is the efficiency in numerical calculations .",
    "one of the weakness is that we have to limit ourselves to @xmath137 of @xmath756 .",
    "( this is not a problem if we consider the extended field of @xmath87 . )",
    "the example with the same initial conditions as in figure [ figure1 ] is presented in figure [ figure9 ] .",
    "the values @xmath889 and @xmath890 in the figure [ figure9 ] are different from those ( @xmath891 ) reduced from the field @xmath892 in figure [ figure1 ] .",

    "first , note that if we take @xmath895 satisfying @xmath896 and @xmath897 then the soliton solutions of the discrete kdv equation over @xmath398 is always periodic with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath3 with a period @xmath815 just like in figure [ figure4 ] .",

    "we introduce two examples where @xmath743 and @xmath136 respectively .",
    "the first example concerns the @xmath902-soliton solution over @xmath903 of the form @xmath904 , where @xmath905 note that all values concerning the speed of solitons ( @xmath906 , @xmath907 , @xmath908 , @xmath909 ) are non - zero .",
    "the second one is the @xmath902-soliton solution over @xmath910 , written as @xmath911 see the figures [ figure11 ] and [ figure12 ] for their solitonic shapes .",
    "\\(ii ) if just one of the values @xmath919 and @xmath920 is zero , the speed of solitary waves is either @xmath130 or @xmath402 . in the figure [ figure13 ] , we present the example of the @xmath902-soliton solution over @xmath910 with the speed of solitons @xmath130 and @xmath402 respectively .",
    "we obtain @xmath898 and @xmath899 for some @xmath924 if and only if the parameter @xmath925 satisfies @xmath926 or @xmath927 .",
    "the solitary waves over @xmath928 go to the right if @xmath926 , and to the left if @xmath929 .      in the case of ,",
    "@xmath936 therefore , @xmath899 if and only if ( @xmath934 and @xmath929 ) or @xmath935 .",
    "note that if @xmath926 or @xmath741 , the discrete kdv equation is reduced to the linear difference equations @xmath937 respectively .",
    "these equations have trivial waves with speed @xmath153 , and do not have soliton solutions .",
    "what we are observing in this section is the reduction of the soliton solution of the discrete kdv equation over @xmath96 , _ not _ the solutions of the ` reduced ' discrete kdv equations . through our methods",
    ", we successfully extract the solitonic structure of solutions over the finite field .      in this section , we study how the discrete kdv equation over @xmath96 is related to the box and ball system ( bbs ) by taking the @xmath0-adic valuations .",
    "the bbs is a famous cellular automaton obtained by taking the ultra - discrete limit of the discrete kdv equation ( section [ udintegrable ] ) .",
    "let us fix @xmath938 for the discrete kdv equation .",
    "we define the new system @xmath939 from @xmath940 as @xmath941 where round@xmath942 denotes the closest integer to @xmath943 .",
    "then the system @xmath884 goes to the time evolution of the bbs in the limit @xmath944 , or @xmath945 .",
    "note that if @xmath946 then we have @xmath947 , and that if @xmath948 we have @xmath949 .",
    "here is an example where @xmath743 and @xmath950 .",
    "we start from the initial condition of the equation : @xmath951 then the evolution of @xmath884 is as in figure [ figure15 ] .",
    "the time evolution obtained here is almost the same as the three soliton interaction of bbs in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the block of @xmath952 s in the initial condition of is a @xmath0-adic analog of a bbs soliton ( array of @xmath901 s ) in the system @xmath884 .",
    "the underlying fact is that the ultra - discrete limit is a super - exponential estimate , whose @xmath0-adic analog is taking @xmath0-adic valuations of the variables .",
    "we studied the discrete dynamical systems over finite fields .",
    "we investigated how to define them without indeterminacies , how to judge their integrability by a simple test similar to the singularity confinement method , and how to obtain the special solutions of them , in particular the solitary wave solutions .",
    "in the first part of the paper , we constructed the space of initial conditions for discrete painlev equations defined over a finite field via the application of the sakai theory .",
    "in particular , we defined the time evolution graph for the discrete painlev ii equation over finite field @xmath151 .",
    "we have found out that , in case of the systems over the finite field , the space of initial conditions can be minimized compared to those obtained through sakai theory , because of the discrete topology of the space .",
    "the second part concerns the extension of the value spaces to local fields , in particular , to the field of @xmath0-adic numbers .",
    "our idea is to define the equations over the field of @xmath0-adic numbers @xmath96 and then reduce them to the finite field @xmath121 .",
    "we generalized good reduction in order to be applied to integrable mappings , in particular , to the discrete painlev equations .",

    "it has been proved that agr is satisfied for discrete painlev ii equation and for @xmath1-discrete painlev i , ii , iii , iv and v equations .",
    "we have found out that agr was satisfied for the hietarinta - viallet equation , and hence was an integrability detector which worked as an arithmetic analog of the singularity confinement test . in the third part",
    ", we applied our methods to the two - dimensional lattice systems , in particular , to the discrete kdv equation and its generalized equation .",
    "we obtained the solitary wave solutions defined over finite fields and showed that they have periods @xmath810 in generic cases .",
    "other special solitary wave solutions which only appear over finite fields have also been presented and their properties have been studied .",
    "one of the future problems is to construct a theory to solve the initial value problems over the non - archimedean valued fields .",
    "we also wish to study further the properties of the reduction modulo a prime of the higher dimensional lattice integrable equations . in this paper",
    ", we have not dealt with the theory of continuous integrable equations over the field of @xmath0-adic numbers and over the finite fields .",
    "for example , @xmath0-adic soliton theory has been investigated by g. w. anderson @xcite .",
