    "one starts with a general system consisting of external leads and a central molecule coupled by tunneling processes .",
    "the electron subsystem on a molecule interacts with bosonic degrees of freedom ( phonons ) , which are eliminated by performing the firsov - lang canonical transformation .",
    "we assume polaronic shifts large enough to make the effective charging energy @xmath19 negative .",
