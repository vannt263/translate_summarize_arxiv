    "<S> it becomes superconducting below about 11 k , goes into an incommensurate antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase below t@xmath2=6.3 k , and develops a net weak ferromagnetic component ( wf ) below t@xmath3=2.3 k , where one of each twenty spins of the initially fully antiferromagnetic modulation are aligned parallel to each other @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , superconductivity survives all magnetic transitions , contrary to what occurs in the chevrel phase compounds ( rrh@xmath4b@xmath4 with r being a rare earth ) , where a reentrance to the normal phase is observed when entering a ferromagnetic state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most salient features is a strong interrelationship between the magnetic and superconducting phase diagrams , first observed in the superconducting upper critical field@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic phase diagram has been studied using a variety of techniques . </S>",
    "<S> neutron scattering and magnetization data have revealed the form of the spin alignment in a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures @xcite . a magnetoelastic tetragonal to orthorhombic distortion has been observed at t@xmath2 using synchroton x - ray scattering@xcite , and the corresponding anomalies in the thermal expansion have been followed in ref.@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> . instead of a well developed bcs superconducting density of states a high amount of excitations appear at the fermi level , with a v - shaped density of states , which persists all the way up to t@xmath5 @xcite , pointing towards a highly anomalous superconducting density of states . </S>",

    "<S> pair breaking due to strong magnetic scattering , has been argued to be more important in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c than in tmni@xmath1b@xmath1c due to the stronger exchange field in the former compound@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the needles were broken in - situ , at low temperatures , providing for clean surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field was applied parallel to the tunneling direction , i.e. along the a axis . </S>",

    "<S> the superconducting features are weak in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c , so we did not resolve the vortex lattice@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we show some representative tunneling conductance curves in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c and in the non - magnetic parent compound luni@xmath1b@xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> we define h@xmath0(t ) as the point where the normalized zero bias conductance ( fig.2 ) reaches 0.99 when increasing temperature or magnetic field . at this point , the tunneling curves are essentially flat and voltage independent below some 10 mv , within the experimental uncertainty . in the fig.[fig3 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show h@xmath0(t ) thus obtained . note </S>",
    "<S> that although the data taken in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c closely follow previous results obtained by tracing the resistive transition ( fig.3 ) , there is a large difference between h@xmath0(t ) found in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c through tunneling spectroscopy and the result obtained by the resistive transition . </S>",
    "<S> this means that there is a large temperature and field range where erni@xmath1b@xmath1c is essentially featureless in the tunneling conductance , still showing zero resistance . in tmni@xmath1b@xmath1c , which has a transition to an antiferromagnetic state below 1.5 k , and where the gap is fully open at low temperatures@xcite , we did not find differences between tunneling data and the resistive transition . </S>",
    "<S> this would imply that magnetism of erni@xmath1b@xmath1c leads to a significant destruction of the superconducting gap in applied magnetic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> note on the other hand that data in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c have been taken down to very low temperatures , extending the range studied in previous work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is a significant positive curvature at high temperatures , characteristic of many nickel borocarbide superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this strong positive curvature has been associated with the anisotropy of the fermi surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are features at t@xmath8 k , t@xmath9 k and t@xmath10 k. the features at 6 k and 2 k are pronounced , and h@xmath0(t ) becomes nearly flat at these points .    </S>",

    "<S> note that features in h@xmath0(t ) are observed at approximately t@xmath11 , t@xmath12 and t@xmath13 ( dashed lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows the same data ( circles tunneling spectroscopy , triangles resistivity ) in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] -3 cm    in fig.[fig4 ] we compare the magnetic and superconducting phase diagrams in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c . as shown in ref.@xcite , when a magnetic field is applied in plane between t@xmath3 and t@xmath14 , the initial incommensurate antiferromagnetic modulation ( q=0.55 - 0.56 a@xmath15 ) , is modified into a field induced weak ferromagnetic state which locks to the lattice and becomes commensurate with a wavevector q=(m / n)a@xmath15 , being m odd and n even in most of the phases discussed in ref.@xcite . when the magnetic field is increased , the wavelength of the commensurate structures is gradually reduced , and the number of spins aligned with the magnetic field increases . </S>",
    "<S> this produces new commensurate phases identified as well in neutron scattering measurements as in magnetization , which shows a steep increase at each transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phases labeled in the fig.[fig4 ] have been identified as the low field incommensurate af phase q@xmath16=0.55 - 0.56 a@xmath15 , and the commensurate phases q@xmath1=0.57 a@xmath15 , q@xmath17=0.58 a@xmath15 and q@xmath4=0.59 a@xmath15 . the final transition to the saturated paramagnetic state occurs at about 2 t along the a axis , for fields much above the loss of detectable superconducting gap via tunneling spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the features at h@xmath0(t ) curve measured using tunneling spectroscopy at t@xmath18 ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) actually coincides with a triple point ( transition q@xmath16-q@xmath1-q@xmath17 ) in the magnetic phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the h@xmath0(t ) curve obtained using tunneling spectroscopy follows the magnetic transitions q@xmath1-q@xmath17 and q@xmath1-q@xmath4 from 4.5 k to 2 k. below about 2 k , another feature with a vanishing slope is observed in h@xmath0(t ) curve obtained using tunneling spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this possibly coincides with another magnetic transition , evolving from the low temperature weakly ferromagnetic state which exists at zero field . </S>",
    "<S> note that the extended gapless region with zero resistance ( fig.4 ) is bound within the magnetic transitions q@xmath1-q@xmath4 , showing that the density of states in this compound is significantly influenced by the underlying magnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , possible explanations for the gapless state can be enhanced magnetic scattering near the surface@xcite , or band - dependent strong pair breaking@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> b@xmath1c with the field applied within the basal plane . </S>",
    "<S> closed circles are points of the magnetic phase diagram obtained by thermal expansion ( see also refs.@xcite ) , and open circles the h@xmath0(t ) data obtained by tunneling spectroscopy ( same as fig.[fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> open triangles are h@xmath0(t ) data obtained through resistivity , from ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dashed lines are the magnetic transitions viewed in neutron scattering experiments ( from ref.@xcite ) , and the different magnetic phases are labeled by q@xmath16-q@xmath4@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic states are labeled with p for paramagnetic state , and with the corresponding q vector , determined in ref.@xcite , for the magnetic states . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] -4 cm    the strong correlation between magnetism and superconductivity in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c leads to remarkable features in the superconducting phase diagram , which closely follows the changes in the local spin arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> the question of how these are linked together remains open for further study . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the vortex lattice , or of the tunneling spectroscopy using superconducting tips@xcite , should be useful , as well as other macroscopic measurements , such as thermal conductivity or london penetration depth . </S>"
