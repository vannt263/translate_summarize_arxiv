    ", we use the quark level estimate @xmath271 by including absorptive contribution in the wc s .",
    "the error for certain values of @xmath1 can be quite large .",
    "for example , for @xmath272 , the error is above @xmath273 .",
    "we also carried out calculations with the dipole penguin operator contribution .",
    "we again find their effects to be small .",
    "in this scetion we comment on some methods for measuring the ckm phase angle @xmath2 .",
    "several different classes of method to measure @xmath2 have been proposed .",
    "one class involve charged @xmath23 decays into a charge kaon and a neutral charmed meson@xcite .",
    "this class of methods is not contaminated by penguin effects because only tree amplitude can mediate such decays .",
    "these should work well and we do not consider them here .",
    "another class of method is to use information from @xmath77 , and @xmath274 . in this case",
    "both tree and penguin amplitudes contribute , and care must be taken to include pegnuin effects .    a method to measure @xmath2 using these decays was first studied by gronau , london and rosner ( glr)@xcite . in this method the tree and strong penguin effects were considered , but the electroweak penguin effects were neglected .",
    "glr argued from isospin analysis that the combined amplitude @xmath275 is a pure @xmath91 amplitude , and therefore only the tree amplitude contributes . using su(3 )",
    "relation shown in eq.([tt ] ) , this amplitude is found to be equal to the decay amplitude @xmath276 , which can be measured .",
    "these three amplitudes form a closed triangle , and similarly for their cp - conjugate amplitudes . using the fact that @xmath277 ( because the tree contributions here are negnigiblely small ) , from the two triangles for the particle and anti - particle decay amplitudes , the relative phase @xmath278 between @xmath279 and @xmath280 can be obtained .",
    "this is a very interesting proposal .",
    "however it was soon pointed out by deshpande and he@xcite that the inclusion of electroweak penguin effects invalidate this method because the electroweak contributions to @xmath281 amplitude are compareable to the tree contribution .",
    "other methods have been proposed to take into account the electroweak penguin effects .",
    "recently gronau , hernandez , london and rosner ( ghlr)@xcite showed that the difficulty with the electroweak penguin effects can be solved by constructing the quadrilaterals discussed in section iii for @xmath88 decays . as is already shown ,",
    "the way used to construct the quadrilaterals in ref.@xcite is not workable .",
    "instead , ghlr used su(3 ) relation to relate one of the diagonal of the quadrilateral to @xmath282 .",
    "this time the common side of the two quadrilaterals is chosen to be @xmath283 .",
    "this method is however very difficult to implement experimentally because the decay amplitude for @xmath284 is dominated by electroweak penguin contribution and has a very small branching ratio@xcite .",
    "a more practical method has recently been proposed by deshpande and he@xcite using su(3 ) relations between the decay amplitudes for @xmath285 decays @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and @xmath289 decay @xmath290 .",
    "this method requires the construction of the triangles obtained from eq.([s3 ] ) @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the pure octet component . using the relation @xmath293 the following result",
    "was obtained in ref.@xcite : @xmath294 where @xmath23 and @xmath295 are the complex quantities defined as @xmath296 shown in fig.4 .",
    "the angle @xmath297 denotes the strong final state rescattering phase of the tree amplitude of @xmath23 ( or @xmath295 ) .",
    "thus @xmath298 can be determined from eq.([bb ] ) .",
    "this method is free from the electroweak penguin contamination problem , and all decays involved have relatively large ( @xmath299 ) branching ratios .",
    "they are within the reach of future experiments@xcite .",
    "the results given in ref.@xcite hold in the exact su(3 ) limit . this relation may be broken by su(3 ) breaking effects due to @xmath300 - @xmath301 mixing , the breaking effects in form factors and mass differences .",
    "we now make quantitative estimates of the influence of su(3 ) breaking effects in the factorization approximation . in this approximation",
