    "in this section we examine the gaussian moment varieties @xmath64 , starting with the case @xmath27 .",
    "the moment variety @xmath65 is a surface in @xmath58 .",
    "its defining polynomial equations are as follows :    [ prop : surface ] let @xmath66 .",
    "the homogeneous prime ideal of the gaussian moment surface @xmath65 is minimally generated by @xmath67 cubics .",
    "these are the @xmath51-minors of the @xmath68-matrix @xmath69    let @xmath70 be the vanishing ideal of the moment surface , and let @xmath71 be the ideal generated by the @xmath51-minors of @xmath72 . a key observation , easily checked in ( [ eq : karlpara ] ) , is that the moments of the univariate gaussian distribution satisfy the recurrence relation @xmath73 hence the row vector @xmath74 is in the left kernel of @xmath72 .",
    "thus @xmath75 , and this means that all @xmath51-minors of @xmath72 indeed vanish on the surface @xmath65 .",
    "this proves @xmath76 .    from the previous inclusion we have @xmath77 .",
    "fix a monomial order such that the antidiagonal product is the leading term in each of the @xmath51-minors of @xmath72 .",
    "these leading terms are the distinct cubic monomials in @xmath78 . hence the initial ideal satisfies",
    "@xmath79 this shows that @xmath80 , and hence @xmath81 has dimension 2 in @xmath58 .",
    "we next argue that @xmath81 is an irreducible surface . on the affine space @xmath82 ,",
    "this clearly holds , even ideal - theoretically , because the minor indexed by @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath83 expresses @xmath84 as a polynomial in @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "consider the intersection of @xmath81 with @xmath87 .",
    "the matrix @xmath72 shows that @xmath88 holds on that hyperplane at infinity , so @xmath89 is a curve .",
    "every point on that curve is the limit of points in @xmath90 , obtained by making @xmath91 larger in an appropriate direction .",
    "this shows that @xmath81 is irreducible , and we conclude that @xmath92 .    at this point",
    "we only need to exclude the possibility that @xmath71 has lower - dimensional embedded components . however , there are no such components because the ideal of maximal minors of a @xmath68-matrix of unknowns is cohen - macaulay , and @xmath81 has the expected dimension for an intersection with @xmath58 .",
    "this shows that @xmath71 is a cohen - macaulay ideal .",
    "hence @xmath71 has no embedded associated primes , and we conclude that @xmath93 as desired .",
    "the @xmath51-minors of the matrix @xmath72 form a grbner basis for the prime ideal of the gaussian moment surface @xmath94 with respect to the reverse lexicographic term order .",
    "the ideal @xmath71 of @xmath65 is generated by the @xmath51-minors of @xmath72 .",
    "our claim states that equality holds in ( [ eq : initialideal ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by examining the hilbert series of both ideals .",
    "it is well known that the ideal of @xmath95-minors of a generic @xmath96-matrix has the same numerator of the hilbert series as the @xmath97-th power of the maximal ideal @xmath98 . since",
    "that ideal is cohen - macaulay , this hilbert series numerator remains unchanged under transverse linear sections .",
    "hence our ideal @xmath71 has the same hilbert series numerator as @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that the two ideals in ( [ eq : initialideal ] ) have the same hilbert series , so they are equal .",
    "the argument above tells us that our surface has the same degree as @xmath99 :    the gaussian moment surface @xmath65 has degree @xmath100 in @xmath58 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the nice determinantal representation extends to the varieties @xmath64 when @xmath101 .",
    "the answer is no , even in the first nontrivial case , when @xmath63 and @xmath102 :    [ prop : g23 ] the @xmath103-dimensional variety @xmath104 has degree @xmath105 in @xmath106 .",

    "the same technique works for all @xmath0 and @xmath18 , and we shall now explain it .",
    "we next define cumulants . these form a coordinate system that is more efficient than the moments , not just for gaussians but for any probability distribution on @xmath22 that is polynomial in the sense of belkin and sinha @xcite .",
    "we introduce two exponential generating functions @xmath112 fixing @xmath113 and @xmath114 , these are related by the identities of generating functions @xmath115 the coefficients are unknowns : the @xmath8 are _ moments _ , and the @xmath116 are _ cumulants_. the integer @xmath117 is the _ order _ of the moment @xmath8 or the cumulant @xmath116 .",
    "the identity ( [ eq : explog ] ) expresses moments of order @xmath21 as polynomials in cumulants of order @xmath21 , and vice versa .",
    "either of these can serve as an affine coordinate system on the @xmath17 whose points are inhomogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath21 in @xmath0 variables . to be precise ,",

    "the transformation ( [ eq : explog ] ) between moments and cumulants is an isomorphism . under this isomorphism ,",
    "the affine gaussian moment variety is the linear space defined by the vanishing of all cumulants of orders @xmath122 .",
    "this implies :    the affine moment variety @xmath123 is an affine space of dimension @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath103-dimensional affine variety @xmath124 is isomorphic to the @xmath103-dimensional linear space defined by @xmath125 .",

    "more precisely , for each ` cluster ' or pair @xmath280 , one can find a non - trivial critical point @xmath281 of the likelihood equations such that the mean estimate @xmath282 lies between them .    in this section",
    "we apply pearson s method of moments to this sample .",
    "the special nature of the data raises some interesting considerations .",
    "as we shall see , the even spacing of the points in the list ( [ eq : specialdata ] ) implies that all empirical cumulants of odd order @xmath283 vanish : @xmath284 let us analyze what happens when applying the method of moments to _ any _ sample that satisfies ( [ eq : oddcumulants ] ) . under this hypothesis",
    "pearson s polynomial ( [ pearsonpoly ] ) factors as follows : @xmath285 recall that @xmath167 represents @xmath286 .",
    "the first root of the pearson polynomial is @xmath287 .",
    "this implies @xmath288 or @xmath289 .",
    "since @xmath85 is the mean of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we conclude that the means are equal : @xmath290 .",
    "however , the equal - means model can not be recovered from the first five moments . to see this , note that the equations for cumulants @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 become @xmath294 , yielding no information on the remaining three parameters .",
    "if we assume that also the sixth moment @xmath43 is known from the data , then the parameters can be identified .",
    "the original system ( [ eq : karlpara ] ) under the equal - means model @xmath295 equals @xmath296 after some rewriting and elimination : @xmath297 assuming @xmath298 , this system can be solved easily in radicals for @xmath299 .    if @xmath300 then @xmath301 is the only real zero of ( [ eq : smallpearson ] ) . if @xmath302 then two other solutions are : @xmath303 note that @xmath167 must be negative because it is the product of the two normalized means .",
    "the mean of the sample in ( [ eq : specialdata ] ) is @xmath304 .",
    "the central moments are @xmath305 this expression is a polynomial of degree @xmath97 in @xmath279 . that polynomial is zero when @xmath97 is odd . using ( [ eq : karlpara2 ] ) , this implies the vanishing of the odd sample cumulants ( [ eq : oddcumulants ] ) . for even @xmath97 ,",
    "we get @xmath306 these polynomials simplify to binomials when we substitute the moments into ( [ eq : karlpara2 ] ) : @xmath307 these are the sample cumulants .",
    "we are aware that these are biased estimators , and _ k - statistics _ might be preferable . however , for simplicity , we shall use ( [ eq : evencumulants ] ) in our derivation .",
    "since @xmath308 , we have @xmath309 in ( [ eq : evencumulants ] ) .",
    "hence the pearson polynomial has three distinct real roots . for @xmath301 , substituting ( [ eq : oddcumulants ] ) and ( [ eq : evencumulants ] ) into ( [ eqmeansol ] ) shows that , for every value of @xmath279 , there are no positive real solutions for both @xmath310 and @xmath311",
    ". thus the method of moments concludes that the sample does _ not _ come from a mixture of two gaussians with the same mean .",
    "next we consider the two other roots in ( [ eq : zweip ] ) . to recover the corresponding @xmath179-values , we use the system ( [ twoeqns ] ) with all odd cumulants replaced by zero : @xmath312 for @xmath313 , the first equation gives @xmath314 , and the second yields a non - real value for @xmath179 , so this is not viable . for @xmath315 , we obtain @xmath316 , and",
    "this is now a valid solution .    in conclusion ,",
    "pearson s method of moments infers a non - equal - means model for the data ( [ eq : specialdata ] ) . using central moments ,",

    "however , for our special data , the algebraic degree of the solution drops , and we could write the estimate in radicals .",
    "the situation is dramatically different for likelihood inference .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the critical points for the likelihood function of the mixture of two gaussians with data ( [ eq : specialdata ] ) have transcendental coordinates , and that the number of these critical points grows with @xmath279 .",
    "it is thus interesting to assess the quality of our solution ( [ estimatormom ] ) from the likelihood perspective .",
    "the probability density function for the gaussian mixture with these parameters is shown in figure [ fig : zwei ] .",
    "the corresponding value of the log - likelihood function is @xmath326 .",

    "that point has a log - likelihood value of approximately @xmath328 . comparing to table 1 of @xcite , this value",
    "is only beaten by the critical points associated to the endpoints @xmath329 and @xmath330 .     the sample data for @xmath322 ( in blue )",

    "* table 1 ) , the middle clusters get the lowest log - likelihood .",
    "hence an equal - means model is not very likely for this sample .",
    "this is further confirmed by the method of moments ( mom ) since , as mentioned above , the equal - means model is inconsistent with our polynomial equations .",
    "behavior similar to example  [ ex : k7 ] is observed for all @xmath331 .",
    "the mom estimate separates the sample into two halves , and assigns the same variance to both gaussian components .",
    "the exact parameter estimates are obtained by substituting @xmath332 from ( [ eq : evencumulants ] ) into ( [ estimatormom ] ) .",
    "for @xmath333 , the estimate computed by the em algorithm with the mom estimate as starting point beats in likelihood value all @xmath279 critical points listed in @xcite . for @xmath334 ,",
    "the likelihood value of the mom estimate itself appears to be already better than the critical points listed in @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the mom produces good starting points for maximum likelihood .",
    "at present we know little about the moment varieties of gaussian mixtures for @xmath101 , and we see this as an excellent topic for future investigations .",
    "a guiding question is the following :      a natural conjecture is that the dimension of the variety @xmath335 always coincides with the expected number ( [ eq : mixturedim ] ) , unless that number exceeds the dimension @xmath336 of the ambient projective space .",
    "it is important to note that the analogous statement would not be true for the submodels where all covariance matrices are zero .",
    "these are the secant varieties of veronese varieties , and there is a well - known list of exceptional cases , due to alexander and hirschowitz ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , where these secant varieties do not have the expected dimension . however , none of these cases is relevant in the case of gaussian mixtures discussed here .",
    "[ ex : s2g24 ] let @xmath337 .",

    "we checked that @xmath338 has the expected dimension , namely @xmath275 .",
    "we found it difficult to compute polynomials that vanish on our moment varieties , including @xmath338 .",

    "it is identical to the gaussian moment variety @xmath104 in proposition [ prop : g23 ] so the mixtures add nothing new in @xmath341 .",
    "the equal - variances submodel of @xmath340 has dimension @xmath343 and degree @xmath30 in @xmath106 .",
    "its ideal is cohen - macaulay and is generated by the maximal minors of the @xmath344-matrix @xmath345    this proposition is proved by a direct computation .",
    "that the equal - means submodel of @xmath340 equals @xmath104 is not so surprising , since the parametrization of the latter is linear in the variance parameters @xmath346 .",
    "this holds for all moments up to order @xmath347 .",
    "the same is no longer true for @xmath348 . on the other hand",
    ", it was gratifying to see an occurrence , in the matrix ( [ eq : hbmatrix ] ) , of the _ hilbert - burch theorem _ for cohen - macaulay ideals of codimension  @xmath7 .",
    "we already noted that secant varieties of veronese varieties arise as the submodels where the variances are zero . on the other hand",
    ", we can also consider the submodels given by zero means . in that case",

    "it is denoted @xmath353 in faa di bruno s book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table @xmath354 ) , where a determinantal formula was given .",
