    "a tree is a graph with no loop within it . owing to the simplicity of its structure and amenability of analytic studies ,",
    "tree graph has drawn considerable attentions in many disciplines of scientific researches .",
    "scale - free ( sf ) random branching tree , in which the number of branches @xmath0 generated from a node is stochastic following a power - law distribution , @xmath1 , is particularly interesting here .",
    "such trees can be found in various phenomena such as the trajectories of cascading failure in the sandpile model on sf networks  @xcite , epidemic spreading on sf networks  @xcite , aftershock propagation in earthquake  @xcite , random spanning tree or skeleton of sf networks  @xcite , phylogenetic tree  @xcite , etc . here",
    ", sf network is the network with the degree distribution following a power law @xmath21  @xcite . so far",
    ", several analytic studies have been performed to understand structural properties of sf branching trees  @xcite . however , most works are focused on the critical case , where the mean branching number @xmath22 is equal to 1 , motivated by universal feature of scale invariance observed in nature and society .",
    "recent studies , however , show that the structure of real - world networks may have been designed upon supercritical trees  @xcite .",
    "supercritical trees , where the mean branching number @xmath23 , turn out to act as a skeleton of some fractal networks such as the world - wide web . here",
    "skeleton  @xcite is defined as a spanning tree formed by edges with highest betweenness centrality or loads  @xcite .",
    "a supercritical branching tree can grow indefinitely with a nonzero probability , which is the most marked difference from critical ( @xmath24 ) or subcritical ( @xmath25 ) tree that can not grow infinitely .",
    "moreover , the total number of offsprings @xmath26 generated from a single root ( ancestor ) up to a given generation @xmath27 can increase exponentially in supercritical trees and this is reminiscent of the small - world behavior : the mean distance between nodes scales logarithmically as a function of the total number of nodes  @xcite .    due to the mean branching number being larger than 1 ,",
    "some supercritical trees may be alive in a very long time limit .",
    "the tree - size distribution of those surviving trees in the supercritical phase has been derived in the mean - field framework  @xcite , which follows a power law , @xmath28 . here , we consider finite - size trees in the supercritical phase . in spite of the large mean branching number , some trees do not grow infinitely even in the supercritical phase . for such finite - size trees in the supercritical phase ,",
    "we derive the tree - size and the lifetime distributions using the generating function technique  @xcite .",
    "distinguished from the critical case , the generating function of the tree - size distribution exhibits two singular behaviors in the supercritical phase and thereby a crossover behavior of the tree - size distribution can arise when @xmath4 .",
    "we present in detail the derivation of all these analytic solutions in the following sections .",
    "the tree - size and lifetime distributions predicted by analytic solutions are confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "this is important in itself for understanding the branching trees whose structure changes drastically depending on the phase .",
    "since the branching tree approach can be applied to numerous systems , our results should be useful for future diverse applications as well .",
    "a tree grows as each of the youngest nodes generates their offsprings following the probability @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qk ] ) .",
    "this evolution is regarded as a process in a unit time step .",
    "when a node generates no offspring with probability @xmath43 , it remains inactive in further time steps .",
    "we define @xmath44 as the fraction of trees with total number of nodes @xmath45 at time @xmath27 . by definition ,",
    "then , @xmath47 can be written in terms of @xmath44 as @xmath48 defining the generating functions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and applying them to ( [ p_relation ] ) , one can obtain that @xmath51 let us consider the tree - size distribution in the @xmath52 limit , i.e. , @xmath53 and its generating function @xmath54 .",
    "however , some trees may grow infinitely in the supercritical phase , which makes @xmath55 ill - defined at @xmath56 .",
    "so we limit the summation in @xmath57 over finite trees only , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "this is equivalent to defining @xmath59 .",
    "then , eq.([g_relation ] ) gives the relation in the @xmath52 limit , @xmath60 the next step is to extract a singular part of @xmath57 from eq .",

    "in particular , when @xmath109 , the asymptotic behaviors in eqs.([eq : ps1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ps2 ] ) differs from each other and thus there should be a crossover behavior in the tree - size distribution .     for @xmath117 for various values of @xmath31 in the scaling form eq .",
