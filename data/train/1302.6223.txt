    "this means that from a general distribution we only want to reproduce the correlations terms @xmath83 with @xmath84 each defined by @xmath85 thus we want to characterize the set @xmath86    for this we refer to problem given by eq .",

    "let us comment that via the general method one can also determine the probability distribution of a general scenario .",

    "@xmath67 even , we can consider the expression @xmath138 and the maximization problem can be expressed as a sdp as in eq .",
    "( [ ncsdp ] ) , with the proper choice of the matrix @xmath97 .",
    "such a sdp has been solved in ref .",
    "the solution is analogous to the previous one : a set of observables , for a two - level system , saturating the bound , again , independently of the quantum state , is given by observables @xmath139 , where the vectors @xmath125 are on a plane with an angle @xmath140 separating @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the above results prove that the bound computed in ref .",
    "@xcite for sequential measurements on qubits , coinciding with the value explicitly obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , is valid for any dimension of the quantum system on which measurements are performed .",
    "finally , we stress that the construction of the above set of observables from the solution of the sdp , i.e. the matrix @xmath26 or the set of vectors @xmath141 such that @xmath142 , is actually completely general .",
    "we recall that the vectors @xmath141 can be obtained , e.g. , as the columns of the matrix @xmath143 , which is well defined since @xmath99 , and , therefore , the dimension of the subspace spanned by them is equal to the rank of the matrix @xmath26 . in the previous case ,",
    "since we were dealing with vectors in dimension @xmath144 , we used the property of pauli matrices @xmath145    for matrices @xmath26 with higher rank , the corresponding vectors @xmath141 will span a real vector space @xmath146 of dimension @xmath147 .",
    "now for general complex vector spaces @xmath146 with a symmetric bilinear form @xmath148 , an analogous of eq.([cliff ] ) , namely @xmath149 defines the associated clifford algebra , where @xmath150 are the associated elements of the algebra and @xmath151 is the identity .",
    "in particular , for @xmath146 a real vector spaces with the standard euclidean scalar product , such a property is satisfied by the corresponding canonical anti - commutation relations ( car ) algebra .",
    "the latter has always a representation in terms of self - adjoint operators on an hilbert space , e.g. , operators written in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators on an antisymmetric fock space @xcite , or written in terms of the clifford algebra generators explicitly constructed in tsirelson s original argument @xcite    as a consequence , for every positive semidefinite real matrix @xmath26 with diagonal elements equal to @xmath152 , one can find a set of unit vectors @xmath141 giving @xmath142 and a set of @xmath153-valued observables @xmath154 , associated with @xmath141 , such that @xmath155 = ( x_i , x_j),\\ ] ] for all quantum states @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , if the rank of @xmath26 is @xmath110 , such operators can be chosen as @xmath156 hermitian matrices @xcite .",
    "this shows the completeness of the simplified method .        at",
    "first let us change slightly the notation in order to make it closer to the one used in ref .  @xcite . in the following",
    "we do not explicitly consider the matrix @xmath48 from the main text , but rather a slightly smaller matrix where one erases some trivial constraints . in the following the set @xmath157",
    "contains all projectors @xmath158 , but one of the outcomes @xmath159 from each setting @xmath37 is left out .",
    "note that we also use a single subscript to identify setting and outcome .",
    "then one looks at the matrix @xmath160\\ ] ] being built up by all products @xmath161 , @xmath162 of the operators @xmath163 of at most length @xmath164 , and the single extra `` sequence '' @xmath165 of the identity operator @xmath166 .",
    "again this matrix has to satisfy linear relations parsed as @xmath167 , if the operators fulfill @xmath168 as a consequence of the orthogonality properties of projectors , and that @xmath169 .",
    "that this matrix is positive semidefinite can be verified as follows : let us first assume that there exists a sequential projective quantum representation . consider the operator @xmath170 with arbitrary @xmath171 and evaluate the expectation value of @xmath172 , which provides @xmath173 c_{\\bf v}^ * \\\\ \\label{eq : chi_positivity } & = \\sum_{{\\bf u , v } } c_{\\bf u } \\chi^n_{{\\bf uv } } c_{\\bf v}^ * \\geq 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using linearity of the trace .",
    "the final inequality holds because @xmath174 and @xmath175 are both positive semidefinite operators . since @xmath171 are arbitrary the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_positivity ] ) means that @xmath176 is positive semidefinite .    for the reverse one needs a way to construct an explicit sequential projective quantum representation out of the matrix",
    "@xmath177 satisfying the above properties .",
    "for this , clearly more difficult part , we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and just mention the solution . for the given positive semidefinite matrix",
    "@xmath178 one associates a set of vectors @xmath179 by the relation @xmath180 . from this set of vectors one",
    "now constructs an appropriate state and corresponding projective measurements by @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 where @xmath184 means the projector onto the given subspace .",
    "that these solution satisfies all the required constraints are shown in the proof of theorem 8 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , in the spatial case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of these operators , additionally , have to commute since they should correspond to measurement onto different local parts .",
    "this can not be inferred , in general , by a finite level @xmath178 and this is the true reason why their characterization gets only exact ( for the commutative bipartite tsirelson problem ) if @xmath32 tends to infinity .",
    "however , since we do not require here that the measurements of different settings have to commute we , luckily , do not need this ."

    "<S> ( [ klyachko ] ) with a larger number of measurements , known as @xmath67-cycle inequality @xcite , @xmath68 for this case , everything can be solved analytically ( see appendix ) leading to the bound @xmath69 which can be reached by suitably chosen measurements . </S>",

    "<S> there , thirteen measurements on a three - dimensional system are considered , and a noncontextuality inequality is constructed , which is violated by any quantum state . it has been shown that this scenario is the simplest situation where state - independent contextuality can be observed @xcite , so it is of fundamental importance . </S>",
    "<S> we can directly apply our method to the original inequality by yu and oh , as well as recent improvements @xcite and compute the corresponding tsirelson - like bounds . </S>",
    "<S> our results are summarized in table 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> .[tab]bounds on the quantum correlations for the kochen - specker inequalities in the most basic scenario . </S>",
    "<S> three inequalities were investigated : first , the original inequality proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the optimal inequalities from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with measurement sequences of length two ( opt2 ) and length three ( opt3 ) . for each inequality , </S>",
    "<S> the following numbers are given : the maximum value for noncontextual hidden variable ( nchv ) models , the state - independent quantum violation in three - dimensional systems , the algebraic maximum and the maximal value that can be attained in quantum mechanics for the sequential measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the latter bound is higher as the state independent quantum value , since the observables do not have to obey the compatibility relations occurring in the kochen - specker theorem . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in all cases the maximal quantum values are significantly below the algebraic maximum . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another class of inequalities is given by the guess - your - neighbors - input ( gyni ) inequalities @xcite , which , if viewed as multipartite inequalities , show no quantum violation but a violation with the use of post - quantum no - signalling resources . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the sequential bound for the case of measurement sequences of length three , instead of measurement on three parties . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath70 with the notation @xmath71 as before , and possible results and settings @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath74 while it is known that @xmath75 and @xmath76 where the indices @xmath77 label , respectively , the classical , quantum , sequential and no - signalling bounds . </S>",
    "<S> so , in this case , the bound for sequential measurements is higher than the bound for spatially separated measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this also highlights the greater generality of our method in comparison with the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : there , only temporal inequalities with sequences of length two have been considered , where in addition the measurements can be split in two separate groups . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it turned out that the bounds were always reached with commuting observables . </S>",
    "<S> our examples show that this is usually not the case , when longer measurement sequences are considered </S>",
    "<S> .    _ discussion & conclusions  _ for interpreting our results , let us note that our scenario is more general than the scenarios considered by leggett & garg and kochen & specker . </S>",
    "<S> leggett & garg consider a special time evolution , @xmath78 which is mapped in the heisenberg picture onto the observables . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the observables are not connected via unitaries , this corresponds to a more general time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the kochen - specker scenario , our approach is more general since it does not assume that the measurements in a sequence are commuting . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , if one wishes to connect existing noncontextuality inequalities to information processing tasks , it is important to know the maximal quantum values ( also if the observables do not commute ) , in order to characterize the largest quantum advantage possible .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we emphasize that in our derivation it was assumed that the measurements are described by projective measurements and this condition is indeed important . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this sheds light on the role of projective measurements : one can easily construct classical devices with a memory , which give for sequential measurements as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ klyachko ] ) the algebraic maximum @xmath79 these classical devices must also have a quantum mechanical description . </S>",
    "<S> our results show , however , that in this quantum mechanical description more general than projective measurements must occur and a more general dynamical evolution than the projection is required . from this perspective , our results prove that the memory that can be encrypted in quantum systems by projective measurements is bounded .    </S>",
    "<S> our results lead to the question , _ why _ quantum mechanics does not allow to reach the algebraic maximum of temporal correlations , as long as projective measurements are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that proper generalizations of concepts like information causality and communication complexity might play a role here , but we leave this question for further research . a first step in explaining quantum mechanics from information theoretic principles lies in the precise characterization of all possible temporal quantum correlations , and our work presents an operational solution to this problem .    </S>",
