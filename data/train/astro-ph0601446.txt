    "@xcite found that the galactic cepheids follow a spectral type that is independent of their pulsational periods at maximum light and gets later as the periods increase at minimum light .",
    "* hereafter skm ) used radiative hydrodynamical models to explain these observational phenomena as being due to the location of the hydrogen ionization front ( hif ) relative to the photosphere .",
    "their results agreed very well with code s observation .",
    "skm further used the stefan - boltzmann law applied at the maximum and minimum light , together with the fact that radial variation is small in the optical @xcite , to derive :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 are the effective temperature at the maximum / minimum light , respectively . if @xmath5 is independent of the pulsation period @xmath6 ( in days ) , then equation ( 1 ) predicts there is a relation between the @xmath7-band amplitude and the temperature ( or the colour ) at minimum light , and vice versa . in other words , if the period - colour ( pc ) relation at maximum ( or minimum ) light is flat , then there is an amplitude - colour ( ac ) relation at minimum ( or maximum ) light .",
    "equation ( 1 ) has shown to be valid theoretically and observationally for the classical cepheids and rr lyrae variables @xcite .",
    "for the rr lyrae variables , @xcite and @xcite used linear and non - linear hydrodynamic models of rrab stars in the galaxy to explain why rrab stars follow a flat pc relation at _ minimum _ light .",
    "later , @xcite used macho rrab stars in the lmc to prove that lmc rrab stars follow a relation such that higher amplitude stars are driven to cooler temperatures at maximum light .",
    "similar studies were also carried out for cepheid variables , as in skm , @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "in contrast to the rr lyrae variables , cepheids show a flat pc relation at the _ maximum _ light , and there is a ac relation at the minimum light .",
    "therefore , the pc relation and the ac relation are intimately connected .",
    "all these studies are in accord with the predictions of equation ( 1 ) .    in paper",
    "i , the galactic , large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) cepheids were analyzed in terms of the pc and ac relations at the phase of maximum , mean and minimum light .",
    "one of the motivations for this paper originates from recent studies on the non - linear lmc pc relation ( as well as the period - luminosity , pl , relation .",
    "see paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the optical data are more consistent with two lines of differing slopes which are continuous or almost continuous at a period close to 10 days .",
    "paper i also applied the the @xmath2-test @xcite to the pc and ac relations at maximum , mean and minimum @xmath7-band light for the galactic , lmc and smc cepheids .",
    "the @xmath2-test results implied that the lmc pc relations are broken or non - linear , in the sense described above , across a period of 10 days , at mean and minimum light , but only marginally so at maximum light .",
    "the results for the galactic and smc cepheids are similar , in a sense that at mean and minimum light the pc relations do not show any non - linearity and the pc(max ) relation exhibited marginal evidence of non - linearity . for the ac relation , cepheids in all three galaxies supported the existence of two ac relations at maximum , mean and minimum light .",
    "in addition , the cepheids in these three galaxies also exhibited evidence of the pc - ac connection , as implied by equation ( 1 ) , which give further evidence of the hif - photosphere interactions as outlined in skm .",
    "to further investigate the connection between equation ( 1 ) and the hif - photosphere interaction , and also to explain code s observations with modern stellar pulsation codes , galactic cepheid models were constructed in paper ii .",
    "in contrast to skm s purely radiative models , the stellar pulsation codes used in paper ii included the treatment of turbulent convection as outlined in @xcite .",
    "one of the results from paper ii was that the general forms of the theoretical pc and ac relation matched the observed relations well .",
    "the properties of the pc and ac relations for the galactic cepheids with @xmath8 can be explained with the hif - photosphere interaction .",
    "this interaction , to a large extent , is independent of the pulsation codes used , the adopted ml relations , and the detailed input physics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the investigation of the connections between pc - ac relations and the hif - photosphere interactions in theoretical pulsation models of lmc cepheids , in addition to the galactic models presented in paper ii . in section 2",
    ", we describe the basic physics of the hif - photosphere interaction .",
    "the updated observational data , after applying various selection criteria , that used in this paper are described in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the new empirical pc and ac relations based on the data used are presented . in section 5",
    ", we outline our methods and model calculations , and the results are presented in section 6 . examples of the hif - photosphere interaction in astrophysical applications are given in section 7 .",
    "our conclusions & discussion are presented in section 8 . throughout the paper , short and long period cepheid",
    "are referred to cepheids with period less and greater than 10 days , respectively .",
    "the partial hydrogen ionization zone ( or the hif ) moves in and out in the mass distribution as the star pulsates .",
    "it is possible that the hif will interact with the photosphere , defined at optical depth ( @xmath9 ) of 2/3 , at certain phases of pulsation .",
    "for example , skm suggested that this happened at maximum light for the galactic cepheids , as the hif is so far out in the mass distribution that the photosphere occurs right at the base of the hif .",
    "the sharp rise of the opacity wall ( where the mean free path goes to zero ) due to the existence of hif prevents the photosphere moving further into the mass distribution and hence erases any `` memory '' of global stellar conditions , including the underlying pc relation .",
    "this lead to a flat relation between period & temperature , period & colour and period & spectral type at maximum light , as seen in skm and paper ii . at other phases , since the hif does not interact with the photosphere , the temperature of the star ( or the colour ) follows the underlying global pc relation .",
    "the hif - photosphere interaction also relies on the properties of the saha ionization equation and the structural properties of the outer envelopes of cepheids .",
    "it is well known that the partition functions in the saha ionization equation are formally divergent unless some atomic physics is used to truncate them . in the pulsation",
    "codes we used , we approximate the partition functions of various atoms by their ground state statistical weights .",
    "the properties of the saha ionization equation in cepheid envelopes are such that hydrogen starts to ionize at a temperature that is almost independent of density , for a certain range of low densities . outside of this range of density , the density dependence increases .",
    "thus , when the photosphere is very close to , or engaged with the hif and the density of these regions is reasonably low , the temperature of the photosphere is less dependent on the surrounding density and hence the global stellar parameters . at higher densities ,",
    "the temperature at which hydrogen ionizes becomes more sensitive to density and hence more sensitive to global stellar parameters .",
    "if the photosphere is far from the hif , or disengaged , then the location of the photosphere and hence the temperature of the photosphere , is again strongly dependent on density and hence on global stellar parameters .",
    "that is why the photosphere needs to be close to , or engaged with the hif for this effect to take place .",
    "moreover , this dependence on density is not sharp so that for `` low '' and `` high '' densities the density dependence of the photospheric temperature is weak and strong respectively .",
    "an examination of figure 15.1 in @xcite demonstrates that this is plausible .",
    "thus as the star pulsates , the photospheric temperature has a density dependence that can be strong or weak depending on phase .",
    "an example where the density dependence is weak are the galactic long period cepheids at maximum light ( skm , paper ii ) : these cepheids display a flat pc relation at maximum light .",
    "these properties of the hif - photosphere interaction can , in turn , affect the temperature of the photosphere and hence the colour of the cepheid .",
    "here we investigate the idea that lmc cepheids with periods below 10 days are such that the hif and photosphere are engaged through most of the pulsation cycle . at periods greater than 10 days",
    ", the photosphere only engages with the hif at maximum light .",
    "the transition is sharp because the photosphere is either at the base of the hif or it is not .",
    "the transition occurs because as the period increases , the @xmath10 ratio increases and this implies the hif is located further inside in the mass distribution , changing the phase at which it can interact with the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the structure of galactic cepheids is such that this interaction only occurs at maximum light , even for cepheids with periods shorter than 10 days .",
    "in paper i , we constructed the light curves of fundamental mode cepheids in the lmc by using the extensive photometric dataset in the ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) database .",
    "however , the dataset used in paper i was downloaded in 2002 , prior to the updated version of the dataset that was available after april 24 , 2003 ( ogle website , udalski 2004 [ private communication ] ) .",
    "the updated version includes additional @xmath7- and @xmath11-band data for most of the cepheids .",
    "in addition , the periods have been refined by the ogle team using the complete set of photometric data . due to",
    "these reasons , we decided to repeat the light curve construction @xcite with the updated data and periods .",
    "since the cepheids in the ogle database are truncated at @xmath12 , due to the saturation of the ccd detector for the longer period ( hence brighter ) cepheids @xcite , we include some additional lmc cepheid data from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to extend the period coverage to @xmath13 in our sample .",
    "the requirements that govern our choice of the published photometric data are : ( a ) latest observations that use the modern day ccd cameras ; ( b ) high quality data with large number of data points per light curve , which provide uniform phase coverage and small scatter of the light curve ; and ( c ) as homogeneous as possible ( i.e. , from a minimal number of sources ) to avoid any additional systematic errors .",
    "these requirements are essential to construct accurate light curves to allow the estimation of colours and magnitudes at maximum , mean and minimum light for our pc and ac study .",
    "hence we did not include some of the older photometric data in this study .",
    "the photometric data of all cepheids , comprising 771 from ogle database , 14 from @xcite+@xcite and 39 from @xcite , were mainly fit with @xmath14 to @xmath15 fourier expansions ( @xmath16 is the order of fourier expansion ) using the simulated annealing method described in @xcite to the @xmath7- and @xmath11-band photometric data .",
    "this is in contrast to paper i that only applied @xmath14 fourier fits .",
    "however , for some of the ogle long period cepheids ( @xmath17 days ) , it was found out that the quality of the fitted light curves could be improved by using a higher order fourier expansion , hence we extended the fit to @xmath18 for these long period cepheids .",
    "all the fitted light curves were visually inspected and the best - fit light curves from the different orders of the fourier expansions were selected . to the best of our knowledge , this analysis also represents a major improvement in the fourier analysis of the ogle data .",
    "the extinction is corrected with the standard procedure , i.e. @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath22 for each ogle cepheids are taken from the ogle database @xcite , while for the cepheids in @xcite+@xcite and in @xcite , the values of @xmath22 are adopted from @xcite and/or @xcite .",
    "to guard against some `` bad '' cepheids or other contamination in our sample , and select only the good cepheids in both bands , we removed some cepheids in the sample according to the following criteria ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    = 7.5 cm    1 .",
    "cepheids without @xmath7- and/or @xmath11-band photometry , or the number of data per light curve ( in either bands or both ) is too low to fit a @xmath14 fourier expansion .",
    "cepheids with poorly fitted or unacceptable @xmath7- and/or @xmath11-band light curves in the sample , such as those with a large scatter of data points or with bad - phase coverage ( large gaps between the phased data points ) .",
    "most of the magnitudes , as well as the colours , at the maximum and/or minimum light from these fitted light curves are very uncertain .",
    "cepheids with possible duplicity in the ogle sample .",
    "some of the possible duplicated cepheids were removed in the ogle database by consulting table 4 of @xcite .",
    "4 .   cepheids with unusual colour .",
    "we first plot out ( as in figure [ figcut][a ] ) the extinction corrected pc relation at mean light .",
    "the plot shows that there are number of outliers in the period - colour plane , mostly with @xmath23 .",
    "the presence of these outliers is probably due to : ( a ) their extinction is either over- or under - estimated ; ( b ) they have blue or red companions that can not be resolved due to the problems of blending ; or ( c ) other unknown physical reasons .",
    "a detailed investigation of these outliers is beyond the scope of this paper , but it is clear that they should be removed from the sample . these outliers are removed with the adopted colour - cut of @xmath24 , a compromise between maximizing the number of cepheids in the sample and excluding the cepheids with unusual colour .",
    "cepheids with unusually low ( or high ) amplitude .",
    "some cepheids with unusually low @xmath7- and @xmath11-band amplitudes were found in the sample .",
    "their amplitudes are typically @xmath25 times smaller as compared to the amplitudes of other cepheids at given period .",
    "some examples of the light curves for these low amplitude cepheids are given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , most of the light curves for these low amplitude cepheids can be fitted with @xmath14 fourier expansion , while other cepheids with `` normal '' amplitude may require higher order fits .",
    "@xcite has briefly discussed some possible physical reasons for these cepheids to have such low amplitudes , e.g. they are just entering or leaving the fundamental mode instability strip @xcite or they have different chemical composition ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the detailed investigation of these low amplitudes cepheids is beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    ", we apply a conservative amplitude cut of @xmath26 mag . in the @xmath7-band to remove the low amplitude cepheids . besides that",
    ", we also remove ogle-286532 ( with unusually low amplitude ) and hv-2883 ( with unusually high amplitude ) as they are clear outliers in the @xmath27-amplitude plot ( not shown , but see * ? ? ?",
    "note that @xcite applied a cut of @xmath28 mag . to remove the low amplitude cepheids in ngc 6822 .",
    "other examples of removing the low - amplitude cepheids can also be found in @xcite .",
    "6 .   cepheids with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in order to guard against possible contamination from the first overtone cepheids @xcite and to be consistent with the previous studies @xcite , we removed cepheids with @xmath29 ( see further justification in @xcite ) . regarding the removal of cepheids with @xmath30 ,",
    "a preliminary analysis of the pc relation reveals that few of the longest cepheids should be removed from the sample , because they are clear outliers in the pc plot at maximum light ( see upper panel of figure [ figpcmax ] ) . without these longest period cepheids , the pc(max ) relation for the long period cepheids",
    "is flat , which is consistent with the results found in paper i. the hypothesis of the hif - photosphere interaction also suggests the flatness of the pc relation at maximum light for long period cepheids .",
    "however , as the period gets longer ( with @xmath31>1.5 $ ] ) , the photosphere disengages from the hif @xcite .",
    "these longest period cepheids have biased the slope of the pc(max ) relation by making the slope becomes steeper .",
    "these selection criteria are guided mainly by the philosophy that it is better to lose some `` bad '' but real cepheids rather than including those spurious and doubtful cepheids in the sample @xcite , or those with bad fitted light curves that will give inaccurate measurements of the maximum and minimum light .",
    "hence , the final sample consists of 641 lmc cepheids that will be considered further .",
    "the locations of the outliers from various selection criteria are shown in figure [ figcut ] for the pc(mean ) relation , @xmath7-band pl relation , @xmath32-@xmath27 relation , where @xmath33 are the fourier amplitudes .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details . ] and the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "note that some of the outliers are located within the `` good '' cepheids .",
    "however they can be eliminated due to various physical reasons as given above , especially those with poorly fit light curves that will give inaccurate measurements at maximum , mean and minimum light . a simple sigma - clipping algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will not be able to remove these outliers @xcite .",
    "to construct the empirical pc & ac relations , we used the following quantities from the fourier fits to the cepheid data as obtained from previous section :    * @xmath7-band amplitude : the difference of the numerical maximum and minimum from the fourier expansion , @xmath34 .",

    "a glance of table [ c9tabpc ] and figure [ c9figpc ] suggests that the lmc pc relations are broken at maximum , mean and minimum light .",

    "recall that equation ( 1 ) predicts that if the pc relation is flat at maximum light , then there is a correlation between the amplitude and the colour at minimum light .",

    "the ml relations are adopted from @xcite and @xcite . in order to be consistent with previous work",
    ", the ml relations used in this paper will also be adopted from these two sources .",
    "however , @xcite only provided two ml relations , one for @xmath122 which are used in paper ii , and another one for @xmath123 .",
    "hence we have to adopt the second ml relation for the lmc models . even though the lmc metallicity is higher than @xmath123 , the lmc is still considered as a low metallicity system in the literature . hence the @xcite ml relation can be approximately applied for the lmc models .",
    "an anonymous referee pointed out that an interpolation of the @xcite ml relations between @xmath122 and @xmath123 should also be used .",
    "we have included the interpolated ml relation in our model calculations . in the context of the hif - photosphere interaction , it is the ml relation which dictates at what period and at what phases this will occur .",

    "although there is a slight deviation for some longer period models , the location of the photosphere is close to the hif within the error bars ( which are defined as the coarseness of the grid points around the location of the hif ) . as in paper ii for the galactic models , the closeness of the photosphere to the base of the hif , for reasonably low densities , results in a flat or almost flat pc relation for the long period lmc cepheids . in the case of minimum light , even though figure [ c9deltalmc ] implies that @xmath163 is nearly constant across the period range and the photosphere is near the base of the hif , as in the case of maximum light , @xmath163 does follow a shallow correlation with period after 10 days .",
    "judging from the error bars of @xmath163 and from figure [ c9bono4]-[c9chiosi13 ] , there is tentative evidence that the photosphere is disengaged from the hif for @xmath161 at minimum light .",
    "hence the temperatures or the colours at minimum light are more dependent on period for @xmath164-@xmath27 relation may not be correlated with the slopes of the pc relation ] and the global properties .",
    "theoretical quantities that can be computed from the models and compared with data include the pulsation periods , the @xmath7-band amplitudes and the fourier parameters , the temperatures and colours at the maximum , mean and minimum light .",
    "these are the pc plots , the ac plots , the period - temperature plots and the fourier parameters plots portrayed in figures [ c9modelpc]-[c9lmcfourier ] . the temperatures in table [ c9tabmaxmin ] & [ c9tabmean ] , after conversion to the @xmath144 colours",
    "as mentioned in previous section , are superimposed along with the observed lmc pc relations as plotted in figure [ c9modelpc ] . similarly ,",
    "figure [ c9modelpt ] graphs the same quantities but on the @xmath165-@xmath27 plane with the observed @xmath144 colours converted to temperatures using the prescriptions given in section 5 .",
    "the theoretical bolometric light curves are converted to the @xmath7-band light curves with the bolometric corrections obtained from the basel database mentioned previously . from the theoretical @xmath7-band light curves ,",
    "the amplitudes can be estimated and these are displayed in figure [ c9modelac ] along with the colours from models to compare with the empirical ac relations .",
    "the fourier parameters of the theoretical @xmath7-band light curves can also be obtained with ( @xmath166 ) fourier expansion .",
    "these fourier parameters are compared with the observational data in figure [ c9lmcfourier ] .",
    "several features are noticed from figure [ c9modelpc]-[c9lmcfourier ] :    1 .",
    "the general trends of the models qualitatively match the observational data .",
    "there are greater discrepancies between the data and short period models , particularly in matching the observed light curve amplitudes .",
    "2 .   the models with the ml relation from @xcite , with lower @xmath10 ratio ,",
    "do better in matching the observations",
    ". these models also tend to lie near the envelopes of the pc , ac , @xmath165-@xmath27 and @xmath167-@xmath27 relations defined by the observational data .",
    "3 .   the slopes of the period - colour ( or period - temperature ) relations at maximum and minimum light from the models roughly match the observational data , i.e. , the theoretical pc(max ) relation is approximately flat and there is a relation at minimum light .",
    "4 .   the temperatures from the models with the @xcite ml relation is cooler ( hence redder ) than the models with the @xcite ml relation and the observed data at maximum light .",
    "in contrast , the temperatures ( or the colours ) at minimum light from the models with these two ml relations are consistent with each other and are located near the blue edge of the observed data .",
    "the means at the descending branches are in better agreement with the observed data than the means at the ascending branches .",
    "this is because the observed means , @xmath168 , are obtained mostly from the descending branches . though previous researchers have noted that temperatures on the ascending and descending branches are not the same at mean light ( as cepheids exhibit loops in cmd ) , what is new here is the way the nature of the hif changes during the pulsation .",
    "the behaviors of the models from the interpolated @xcite ml are closer to the models from @xcite ml relation because their slopes are very similar .",
    "the amplitudes of the theoretical light curves ( in both of the bolometric and @xmath7-band light curves ) are smaller than the observations at given period , especially for the models with the @xcite ml relation .",
    "these can be seen from the ac relations as given in figure [ c9modelac ] and the left panels of figure [ c9lmcfourier ] .",
    "overall , some agreements and disagreements are found between the theoretical quantities and the observational data .",
    "it is also found out that there are some problems associated with the pulsation codes when the lmc models are constructed : these include the smaller amplitude of the model light curves and the cooler temperatures at the maximum light ( especially with @xcite ml relation ) .",
    "note that from equation ( 1 ) , cooler temperatures at maximum light imply that the amplitudes will be lower at given period .",
    "varying other parameters in the pulsation codes , including the @xmath118 parameters , does not improve the situation , though perhaps a more detailed and systematic study of the dependence of lmc cepheid pulsation models on the @xmath169 parameters could resolve this situation .",
    "however , we believe that the qualitative nature of the photosphere - hif interactions as given in figure [ c9deltalmc ] will still hold even in models which fare better in mimicking observed amplitudes .",
    "this is in part because figure [ c9deltalmc ] suggest that the behaviors of @xmath139 as a function of period are nearly , though not completely , independent of amplitudes , as the models with @xcite ml relation have higher amplitudes ( although still smaller than the observations ) than the models with the @xcite ml relation .",
    "however , better codes that fix these problems or the 3-d convection codes are needed in the future studies .",
    "the temperature profiles from the galactic models given in paper ii and the lmc models are compared in figure [ c9pt ] at maximum and minimum light .",
    "the upper panels of figure [ c9pt ] suggest that at maximum light , the photosphere is not far from the base of the hif in both of the galactic and the lmc models .",
    "in contrast , the photosphere is further away from the hif in the galactic models than the lmc models at minimum light .",
    "the hif is located further out in the mass distribution for the galactic models .",
    "the plots of the @xmath139-@xmath27 relation from the galactic and lmc models at maximum and minimum light are also compared in figure [ c9delta ] .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that at maximum light , the behavior of both galactic and lmc models is similar , where the photosphere is near the base of the hif . at minimum light ,",
    "the long period models show that the photosphere is disengaged from the hif , while the behavior of the short period models is different between the galactic and lmc models .",
    "the photosphere of the short period lmc models seems to be located closer to the hif at minimum light , but it is not the case for the short period galactic models .",
    "this could lead to shallower slopes of the pc(min ) relation seen in the lmc cepheids as compared to the galactic counterparts . in terms of the hif - photosphere interaction , there is some tentative evidence from the models that the lmc long period cepheids behave like the galactic cepheids , while the short period lmc cepheids behave like the rr lyrae stars at minimum light .",
    "figure [ c9density ] graphs the density ( defined as @xmath170 , where @xmath7 is the specific volume ) at the photosphere as a function of the period of the model at minimum , maximum and ascending and descending mean light .",
    "galactic models generally tend to have the lowest density and , in particular , have significantly lower densities at minimum light than the lmc models .",
    "we note that the galactic models always have a photospheric density lower than about @xmath171 whereas the photospheric density for the lmc models only falls below this figure after a period of 10 days . at maximum light ,",
    "all long period models have a low photospheric density .",
    "what we get from this figure is that it provides some evidence that there is a difference in photospheric density between the lmc and galactic models .",
    "moreover , this difference appears to be consistent with what is required by our theoretical scenario : short period lmc models have a higher photospheric density than their galactic counterparts .",
    "however , for a discussion of some caveats , see section 8 .",
    "we now discuss two important applications of the photosphere - hif interaction : reddening corrections and the explanation of the observed non - linear lmc pl ( and pc ) relations .",
    "@xcite original interest in the spectral properties of cepheids at maximum light was to estimate reddening .",
    "skm used this to correct a number of reddening for galactic cepheids . @xcite",
    "used equation ( 1 ) and the theoretical explanation provided in skm to derive a relation linking the colour excess to the colour at maximum light , the @xmath7-band amplitude and the period .",
    "such a relation is predicted from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "@xcite estimates the error with this method to be comparable to other multi - colour methods .",
    "a more interesting application of the hif - photosphere interaction is to explain the recent detected non - linear lmc pl relation as presented in @xcite , paper i , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "paper i used the @xmath2-test to provide strong statistical evidence that the optical cepheid pl relation at mean light in the lmc is non - linear around a period close to 10 days .",
    "@xcite used the macho and 2mass datasets together with additional long period cepheids from the literature to further support the existence of non - linear lmc pl relation in the optical and near infra - red wave - bands .",
    "in contrast , current data indicate that the galactic pl relation is linear at mean light @xcite .",
    "non - linearity of the lmc pl relations can be tested using the @xmath2-test with the data given in section 3 .",
    "the empirical results of the fitted lmc pl relations at maximum , mean and minimum light using the updated data are presented in table [ c9tabpl ] .",
    "the plots of the pl relations at maximum / minimum light and at mean light are shown in figure [ c9plmaxmin ] & [ c9plmean ] , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2-test results for these pl relations are : @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "the large @xmath2-values for both @xmath7- and @xmath11-band pl relations at mean and minimum light strongly indicate that the pl relations at these two phases are not linear , and the data is better described with the broken ( i.e , two regressions ) pl relation .",
    "however , the small @xmath2-values at maximum light , with corresponding @xmath174-values of @xmath175 and @xmath176 for the @xmath7- and @xmath11-band pl(max ) relations respectively , show that the null hypothesis of the @xmath2-test can not be rejected ( a value of @xmath177 and/or @xmath178 is required for doing this ) .",
    "hence there is no observed break seen in the pl(max ) relation and the data is consistent with single line regression .",
    "note that the same slopes of the pl(max ) relations for long period cepheids in both bands are consistent of the finding that the pc(max ) relation is flat for these cepheids .    lcccccc phase & @xmath179 & @xmath180 & @xmath181 & @xmath182 & @xmath183 & @xmath184 +   + maximum & @xmath185 & @xmath186 & 0.260 & @xmath187 & @xmath188 & 0.170 + mean & @xmath189 & @xmath190 & 0.208 & @xmath191 & @xmath192 & 0.141 + minimum & @xmath193 & @xmath194 & 0.204 & @xmath195 & @xmath196 & 0.140 +   + maximum & @xmath197 & @xmath198 & 0.257 & @xmath199 & @xmath200 & 0.174 + mean & @xmath201 & @xmath202 & 0.228 & @xmath203 & @xmath204 & 0.158 + minimum & @xmath205 & @xmath206 & 0.243 & @xmath207 & @xmath208 & 0.174 +   + maximum & @xmath209 & @xmath210 & 0.260 & @xmath211 & @xmath212 & 0.169 + mean & @xmath213 & @xmath214 & 0.203 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 & 0.138 + minimum & @xmath217 & @xmath218 & 0.194 & @xmath219 & @xmath220 & 0.131 +    our tentative theoretical explanation for the non - linear nature of the lmc pl relations across a period of 10 days replies on the hif - photosphere interaction .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have established the connection between the pc and pl relations : both these relations arise from the more general plc relation .",
    "these relations refer to quantities evaluated at mean light .",
    "the existence of such a connection relies on the period - mean density theorem , the instability strip and the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "if we assume the stefan - boltzmann law can be applied at every phase , then it is straightforward to show that a plc relation ( though possibly with different coefficients ) exists at every phase point . thus the standard plc relation and",
    "indeed the pc and pl relation expresses at mean light are just the averages of the same relations at different phases points .",
    "consequently one way to understand the behavior of plc / pl / pc relations at mean light is to understand their behavior at different phase points .",
    "what we try to do in this paper is point out some evidence from our models that shows how the changing behavior of the pc relations at different phases can , in principle , arise from a consideration of the photosphere - hif interaction at these phases .",
    "since the mean light pc and pl relation are the average of those at all phases , these properties can affect the pc and , as a consequence , the pl relation ( via the plc relation ) .",
    "in fact , the new data with superb phase resolution from such micro - lensing projects such as ogle and macho demands a multiphase analysis . this approach can potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the pulsation and evolution of cepheid variables .",
    "for example , @xcite looked at pc relations in the galaxy and lmc as a function of phase .",
    "they found that short and long period lmc cepheids have a shallower and steeper slope at most pulsation phases than galactic cepheids respectively .",
    "in this paper , we have confronted updated pc and ac relations at maximum , mean and minimum light for lmc cepheids observed by the ogle team , and additional cepheids from the literature , with theoretical , full amplitude pulsation models of lmc cepheids .",
    "the observed pc and ac relations provide compelling evidence of a non - linearity or break at a period of 10 days .",
    "we also constructed theoretical cepheid pulsation models appropriate for the lmc using the florida pulsation codes @xcite to study the hif - photosphere interaction .",
    "the empirical results presented in this paper , as well as in other papers such as @xcite and @xcite , provide strong empirical evidence that the pc and pl relations for the lmc cepheids are non - linear , in the sense described in previous sections .",
    "issues such as extinction and a lack of long period cepheids that may cause the non - linear lmc pl and pc relations have been addressed and argued against in paper i , @xcite and @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "other arguments against the non - linear lmc pl relation include the results presented in @xcite , as the authors found no evidence for a non - linear pl relation in the lmc at @xmath221-bands .",
    "however , @xcite treated the data of @xcite extensively and found , in a statistically rigorous way , that the reason why @xcite found linear @xmath221 pl relations , is due to the small number of short period cepheids ( @xmath222 ) in their sample .",
    "@xcite also reduce the number of ogle / macho lmc cepheids and show how the @xmath2-test can produce a non - significant result when the number of short / long period cepheids become small . instead , using the 2mass data that are cross - correlated with macho cepheids , @xcite have found that the lmc @xmath223-band pl relations are non - linear - band than in @xmath224-band , as shown in @xcite . ] and the @xmath225-band pl relation starts to become linear . @xcite",
    "also discussed why this is the case .",
    "another argument against the non - linear pl relation is that the pl relation should be universal , as found in @xcite .",
    "we argue that their results are based on a handful of cepheids ( @xmath226 ) and on short periods cepheids in a cluster whose membership to the lmc is in question .",
    "their shallower galactic pl relation based on the revised infra - red surface brightness method also contradicts the steeper galactic pl relation based on independent methods from open cluster main - sequence fitting @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that our sample selection does not affect the detection on non - linear lmc pl relation at mean light .",
    "since the mean magnitudes of a cepheid light curve is less affected by our constrains on selecting the cepheids with good light curves , we can use the published ( reddening corrected ) mean magnitudes to test the non - linear lmc pl relation .",
    "the anonymous referee kindly provided a large sample of lmc cepheids that combined the published mean @xmath7-band magnitudes from the ogle , @xcite and @xcite datasets .",
    "there are a total of 115 long period cepheids in this sample and the @xmath2-test still return a significant detection of the non - linear lmc pl relation .",
    "the ogle+@xcite combined data also give very similar results .",
    "similar tests have also been done in @xcite by using the macho data alone and the macho+@xcite combined data .",
    "the non - linear lmc pl relation is still present from the @xmath2-test results on these two datasets",
    ". therefore we believe our sample selection does not affect the detection of the non - linear lmc pl relation .",
    "the detection of non - linear lmc pl relation from totally independent ogle and macho data , using totally independent reddening estimates , suggested that this non - linearity is real and our paper is the first attempt to theoretically explain this non - linearity in terms of the hif - photosphere interaction .    due to small number of lmc models , it is impossible to derive the theoretical pc and ac relations with a small error on the slope and compare directly to the empirical relations .",
    "however , these lmc models can be qualitatively compared to the observations by converting some physical quantities to the observable quantities and vice versa , such as the temperature - colour conversion .",
    "hence we compared our model light curves to the observations in terms of theoretical pc and ac relations at the phases of maximum , mean and minimum light and also in terms of the fourier parameters from theoretical light curves with observations .",
    "the theoretical quantities from the models generally agree with the observations , but it was found out that these models tend to have smaller amplitudes and ( hence ) the temperature is cooler at maximum light than the real cepheids . though our models have some drawbacks in this comparison , our main interest is in comparing the interaction of the photosphere and hif as a function of phase with similar results presented in paper ii for galactic cepheid pulsation models .",
    "the aim is _ not _ to compare our models rigorously with observations but rather to study models which match observations reasonably well in the context of the theoretical framework described in previous sections and in paper i & ii . nevertheless we argued that the qualitative nature of the photosphere - hif interaction is not seriously affected by these problems .",
    "our postulate is that at certain phases , this interaction can affect the pc relation due to the properties of the saha ionization equation : specifically for reasonably low densities in cepheid envelopes , hydrogen ionizes at a temperature that is almost independent of period .",
    "consequently , when the photosphere is located at the base of the hif , the photospheric temperature and hence the colour is almost independent of period .",
    "however , when this engagement occurs , but the density is greater , then the temperature at which hydrogen ionizes again becomes sensitive to global surroundings and hence on period .",
    "when the photosphere is not engaged with the hif in this way , its temperature is again dependent on period and global stellar parameters .    for galactic cepheids",
    ", this hif - photosphere interaction occurs mainly at maximum light for cepheids with @xmath227 ( paper ii ) . at minimum light ,",
    "there is a strong correlation between the hif - photosphere distance and period leading to a definite ac relation at minimum light for galactic cepheids ( skm , paper i & ii ) . in this paper",
    ", we have found tentative evidence that , for short period lmc models which match observations in the period - color plane , the hif - photosphere interaction occurs at most phases but at densities which are too high to produce a flat pc relation",
    ". why would these short period lmc cepheids be different in this regard to short period galactic cepheids ?",
    "one possibility could be that this is partly because these lmc cepheids are hotter than their galactic counterparts @xcite .",
    "the hif - photosphere are disengaged for most of the pulsation cycle for long period lmc cepheids .",
    "this happens because as the period increases , so does the @xmath10 ratio which pushes the hif further inside the mass distribution . when the hif - photosphere are disengaged in this way , the photospheric temperature is more dependent on density and hence on period .",
    "the change is sudden because the hif - photosphere are either engaged or they are not .",
    "this can lead to a sudden change in the pc relation at 10 days as shown by the observations @xcite .",
    "however , at maximum light the hif - photosphere are engaged at low densities for long period lmc cepheids leading to the observed flat pc relation for these stars . taken together with equation ( 1 ) , this theoretical scenario is consistent with the observed pc - ac behavior described in paper i and in this study .",
    "the anonymous referee has noted that these suggestions about photospheric density can be tested by spectroscopic means .",
    "we now enumerate some caveats to our argument that could be addressed in future papers .    1 .   since the smc pc relation at mean light is linear ( e.g. , paper i ) , how do smc ( i.e. , metal - poor ) models fit into the theoretical scenario outlined in this paper and paper ii , if at all ? this is a difficult question and its full answer is beyond the scope of this paper",
    "however , as the metallicity decreases , we do note that the smc has a different ml relation to the lmc and galaxy and so does the temperatures associated with the instability strip .",
    "these will change the relative location of the hif and photosphere @xcite and possibly alter the phase at which they interact .",
    "further the amplitudes for smc cepheids are smaller due to the lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "this will also affect the hif - photosphere interaction .",
    "one difference which can be consistent with this is the fact that the pc relation at maximum light in the smc is not flat ( see paper i ) but it is the case for the galaxy and lmc pc relations .",
    "this indicates that at maximum light , there is less interaction between the hif and photosphere at low densities .",
    "this leads to an observed linear pc relation at mean light for the smc cepheids .",
    "these will be investigated further in a future paper in this series .",
    "2 .   could the well - known hertzsprung progression play any part in causing the observed changes in the galactic and lmc pc relations ?",
    "it may also be that higher order overtones becoming unstable or stable , though with the fundamental mode still being dominant , may also have an impact on the pc relation in some as yet unknown way ( paper ii ) .",
    "4 .   the behavior of short period lmc cepheids still needs to be understood , for example , what causes the difference between the bottom left panels of figures [ c9deltalmc ] and [ c9delta ] ?",
    "that is , why is it that for short period galactic / lmc cepheids , the hif - photosphere are disengaged / engaged ?",
    "our experience suggests that constructing short period full amplitude fundamental mode cepheids requires more care than the long period case because the first overtone has a non - negligible growth rate .",
    "because of this we feel a thorough study of these short period cepheids merits a separate paper .",
    "5 .   would more advanced pulsation codes which , for example , can match the observed amplitudes and which contain a more accurate model of time dependent turbulent convection , yield similar results , especially for figure [ c9delta ] ?",
    "could such codes fare better in modeling short period lmc cepheids ?",
