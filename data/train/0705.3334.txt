    "observations suggest that the formation of structure in the universe is due to the existence of a primordial spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations .",
    "the fact that they are superhorizon strongly supports the hypothesis that these perturbations were generated through an acausal process . the most compelling mechanism for this to date is cosmic inflation .",
    "during inflation , all light , non - conformally invariant fields undergo particle production and obtain a superhorizon spectrum of perturbations",
    ". these perturbations can be responsible for the generation of the curvature perturbation in the universe , if their spectrum is compatible with the observations .",
    "traditionally , it has been considered that it is the perturbations of the inflaton field itself , which give rise to the curvature perturbation .",
    "however , this inflaton hypothesis typically results in overconstraining inflation model - building , which leads to fine - tuning .    for this reason ,",
    "alternative suggestions have been recently put forward . according to such proposals , the field responsible for the curvature perturbation may have little or nothing to do with the dynamics of inflation .",
    "one possibility is to consider a field whose contribution to the density is negligible during inflation but , after the end of inflation , it manages to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the universe before its decay , thereby imposing its own curvature perturbation spectrum .",
    "this is the so - called curvaton hypothesis @xcite . under this hypothesis",
    "the fine - tunning problems of inflation are alleviated @xcite , while one can attain inflation at low energy scales @xcite .",
    "many suggestions in the literature offer realistic candidates in theories beyond the standard model , which can play the role of the curvaton field .",
    "another suggestion along similar lines is that the field responsible for the curvature perturbation is not related to the dynamics of inflation but it affects the reheating process by modulating the decay rate of the inflaton .",
    "this is the inhomogeneous reheating mechanism @xcite , which can also allow for low - scale inflation @xcite .    until now",
    "the literature considers that the curvature perturbation in the universe is due to particle production of a suitable _ scalar field _",
    ", typically through one of the above mechanisms .",
    "however , even though theories beyond the standard model ( in particular supersymmetric theories ) contain a plethora of scalar fields , the fact that no scalar field has been observed as yet undermines somewhat the predictability and falsifiability of these models .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we consider the possibility that the curvature perturbation is due to particle production of a _ vector field _ during inflation .",
    "a massive vector field is non - conformally invariant and can indeed undergo particle production during inflation . in ref .",
    "@xcite this scenario has been investigated for a massive abelian vector field .",
    "it was shown that a scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations can be generated provided the mass of the vector field satisfies the condition during inflation , where @xmath0 is the inflationary hubble scale .",
    "however , this condition is hard to realise in a theoretically well motivated way .",
    "this problem is overcome in this paper by considering a non - trivial evolution of the kinetic term for the vector field , during inflation . in supergravity",
    "the kinetic term of vector fields is determined , in general , by the gauge kinetic function which is a holomorphic function of the fields of the theory .",
    "we consider a similar setup here and assume that , the kinetic function is dominated by a degree of freedom which varies substantially during inflation , while the cosmological scales exit the horizon .",
    "we find that a scale - invariant spectrum of vector field perturbations can be attained , without the need for a negative mass - squared for the vector field , if the kinetic function is growing with time during inflation .",
    "we then investigate how such a spectrum of vector field perturbations can give rise to the observed curvature perturbation in the universe .",
    "in general , a homogeneous vector field generates an anisotropic pressure , which , if dominant , results in a large - scale anisotropy that contradicts the observations ( isotropy of the cmb ) .",
    "this is why , the vector field can not play the role of the inflaton ( see , however , @xcite ) . on the other hand , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a massive oscillating vector field has zero average pressure and behaves as pressureless , isotropic matter .",
    "thus , it can safely dominate the universe without generating a long - range anisotropy .",
    "hence , one can employ the curvaton mechanism to generate the curvature perturbation in the universe , using as curvaton a massive vector field , which has assumed a scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations during inflation . in this paper we study in detail the use of such a vector field as curvaton .",
    "one other way to attempt to generate the curvature perturbation from the vector field without the latter ever dominating the universe , is by considering that the vector field controls the decay rate of the inflaton , resulting in inhomogeneous reheating .",
    "we briefly investigate this scenario as well .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the equations of motion for the perturbations of a massive vector field with a varying kinetic function and mass . in sec .",
    "iii we study particle production during inflation of this vector field and obtain the necessary conditions to attain the desired scale - invariant spectrum . in sec .",
    "iv we study the dynamics of the scalar field which controls the kinetic function for our vector field . in sec .",
    "v we obtain the spectrum of the produced perturbations in the case when the vector field has constant mass and also when its mass is controlled by the scalar field which also controls the kinetic function . in sec .",
    "vi we study analytically the curvaton scenario . by obtaining the energy - momentum tensor for the vector field",
    "we find the scaling of its density during and after inflation and reheating .",
    "we then implement this to find the parameter space in which the vector field can generate the curvature perturbation .",
    "we find that the lower bound on the inflationary scale is too stringent to allow the scenario to work . in sec .",
    "vii we employ the mass increment mechanism to lower further the inflationary scale .",
    "the mechanism assumes that the mass of the vector field grows at a phase transition after the end of inflation . in sec .",
    "viii we study possible complications to the scenario due to the dynamics and to particle production of the scalar field that controls the kinetic function . in sec .",
    "ix we present a concrete example of our vector curvaton model , taking all the constraints into account . in sec .",
    "x the inhomogeneous reheating mechanism is tried out , using as the inflaton the field that controls the kinetic function .",
    "the mechanism is shown to be ineffective . finally , in sec .",

    "@xcite a coherently oscillating , homogeneous , massive abelian vector field corresponds to pressureless , _ isotropic _ matter , and can dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the universe without introducing a long - range anisotropy . when it does so , it imprints its own curvature perturbation spectrum , as in the curvaton scenario .",
    "we followed the evolution of the vector field and obtained the corresponding bounds on the inflationary scale for the scenario to work .",
    "we found , however , that the parameter space does not allow enough inflation for the solution of the flatness and horizon problems . to overcome this problem the lower bound on the inflationary scale must be relaxed , i.e.",
    "low - scale inflation is required .    to attain low - scale inflation we employed the mass increment mechanism , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scenario",
    "a phase transition after the end of inflation enlarges the mass of the vector curvaton field .",
    "we have explored the parameter space under this mechanism and showed that it is possible to solve the horizon and flatness problems and also produce the required amplitude for the scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations provided the phase transition does not occur much earlier than the breakdown of electroweak unification .",
    "we also found that the best results are obtained if the curvaton decays as soon as it comes to dominate the universe .",
    "we demonstrated our findings in a concrete example , which serves as an existence proof that the mechanism works with natural values of the parameters . in our example",
    "we considered the case of a higgsed vector curvaton , which can also explain the initial conditions of the rolling @xmath56 .",
    "we have assumed that the phase transition which enlarges the mass of the field occurs at temperature .",
    "the mass of the vector field is roughly comparable to the inflationary scale , which turns - out to be .",
    "reheating is assumed prompt , but the reheating temperature is low enough not to result in gravitino overproduction . at the phase transition the vector curvaton assumes roughly 1  % of the density of the universe , which is reasonable on energy equipartition grounds .",
    "rapid oscillations of the vector field allow it to dominate the universe at temperature .",
    "the vector field is taken to decay at domination so as not to disturb bbn .",
    "the scenario works for , which is a comfortably large range of parameter space , including both the grand unified and the electroweak scales . unless one considers a large - field model of inflation",
    "the spectral index is indistinguishable from unity .",
    "however , for a large - field model ( e.g. chaotic inflation ) , one attains a lower value for the spectral index , which agrees better with the observations .",
    "finally , we have also studied the possibility that the vector field generates the observed curvature perturbation spectrum through the so - called inhomogeneous reheating mechanism . in this case , the rolling @xmath56 field is taken to be the inflaton , whose decay rate is modulated by the perturbations in the vector field . even though the idea sounds promising ,",
    "our results show that the scenario is inviable .    in summary ,",
    "we have investigated the use of a massive abelian vector field for the generation of the observed curvature perturbation spectrum in the universe .",
    "we have shown that , it is possible to attain a scale - invariant spectrum with a positive mass - squared for the vector field , provided the kinetic function is growing during inflation . in this case",
    "the vector field can act as a curvaton .",
    "the mechanism works with low - scale inflation , when the mass of the vector field increases at a phase transition near the breakdown of electroweak unification .",
    "the form of the kinetic function as well as other aspects of the mechanism ( such as masses of order the hubble scale ) can be naturally accommodated in the theoretical framework of supergravity .",
