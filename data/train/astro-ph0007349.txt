    "in this paper we present a large scale high angular resolution ( @xmath11 ) study of the continuum emission at 205 and 138 from the two giant molecular clouds orion a and orion b ( south ) in the orion complex .",
    "the mapped region of orion a includes omc-1 , 2 , 3 and iras 05327 - 0457 ( ngc 1977 ) . in orion",
    "b we have mapped mainly the southern portion covering ngc 2023 and ngc 2024 .",
    "limited regions including , omc-1 and 2 in orion a and ngc 2024 in orion b have also been observed at 57 .",
    "the southern part of the orion cloud complex , also known as orion a , contains star forming cores which are distributed along the north - south direction ( integral shaped ridge ) and named omc-1 , 2 and 3 from south to north .",
    "observations at sub - millimeter / far - infrared wavelengths have shown that both warm and cold dust with quite different spatial distribution contribute to the emission from the orion molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "cold dust , with temperature @xmath1 20 - 25 k , accounts for bulk of the mass of dust in the orion clouds and emits significantly only at wavelengths longer than 100 .",
    "earlier observations of orion a concentrated on the emission from the hot dust viz . ,",
    "mapping of omc-1 at 50 - 100  by @xcite and of m43 at 37 - 160  by @xcite .",
    "later observations have mostly explored the emission from the cold dust in this region .",
    "the most recent of these observations was by @xcite covering omc-1 , 2 and 3 and extending over an area of 50@xmath210  with an angular resolution of @xmath1 75 at 450  and 14at 850 .",
    "@xcite had also mapped a region of 6@xmath218  covering omc-2 and 3 at 350  with an angular resolution of 11 . however , the pioneering work in detecting a number of cold sources in omc-2 and an extremely cold one ( @xmath1 10 k ) in omc-3 was by @xcite , who mapped a region of @xmath115@xmath25  with an angular resolution of @xmath1 11  at 1300 .",
    "most of these condensations are considered to be protostellar candidates because of the associated outflow activities @xcite .",
    "observations in molecular lines like c@xmath3o by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; and references therein ) have revealed that the gas in omc-2 and omc-3 have kinetic temperatures equal to 24 k and 19 k respectively , both much smaller than that in omc-1 ( 70 k ) .",
    "these observations also identified both , omc-2 and omc-3 , to be regions of high column density .",
    "c@xmath3o observations have also detected several moderate to strongly collimated bipolar outflows in omc-3 , which suggests recent star formation activity .",
    "the very low temperatures of sources in both omc-2 and 3 along with the evidence for star formation , indicate very early stages of evolution of , probably intermediate mass stars . in this paper",
    "we have explored the distribution of dust emission and temperature of the orion a region in a wavelength regime ( 205 & 138  in particular ) where no high angular resolution measurements exist in literature .",
    "the orion b cloud contains 4 major sites of star formation , ngc 2071 & ngc 2068 in the north and ngc 2023 & ngc 2024 in the south .",
    "we have observed only the regions around ngc 2024 and 2023 .",
    "the brightest emission source in the region is ngc 2024 , which is a region of active star formation .",
    "the 1300  observations over a region of @xmath1 5@xmath25  ( with an angular resolution @xmath1 30 ) by @xcite have revealed six condensations in ngc 2024 , aligned in the north - south direction .",
    "these condensations also have masers and hii regions associated with them .",
    "the nature of these condensations was an issue of debate which was resolved by @xcite . from their observations at 870 & 1300  they concluded that these condensations are indeed isothermal protostars .",
    "@xcite presented a survey of orion b ( lynds 1630 ) molecular cloud in cs(2 - 1 ) line ( 18 angular resolution ) and identified the regions including ngc 2023 and ngc 2024 to be bright in cs , thus indicating high density of the region . in a follow - up program",
    "@xcite surveyed orion b in the k ( 2.2 ) band and found that more than 50% of the nir sources are associated with the 4 identified star forming regions .",
    "in a recent high angular resolution ( 22 - 30 ) survey of orion b ( south ) at 1300  extending over @xmath180@xmath268 , @xcite have identified some of the dust emission peaks around ngc 2023 and ngc 2024 with the cs cores detected by @xcite . of the existing fir observations of ngc 2023 and ngc 2024 , the iras observations in the first place trace",
    "relatively warmer dust ( @xmath4 30 k ) and secondly have angular resolutions varying with wavelength , so that calculating the temperature distribution from the observed flux densities is not straightforward . on the other hand , the 1300  observations ,",
    "though of high angular resolution , trace extremely cold dust",
    ". this has motivated us to carry out simultaneous high angular resolution far - infrared observations at 205 and 138  with identical beams so that the density and temperature distribution of dust emitting significantly in this intermediate regime can be reliably quantified .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations and section 3 contains the results and discussion of the same .",
    "orion molecular clouds a and b ( south ) were observed using a two - band far - infrared photometer system ( pht-12 ) at the cassegrain focus of the tifr 1-meter ( f/8 ) balloon - borne telescope .",
    "the far - infrared telescope was flown from the tifr balloon facility , hyderabad , in central india ( latitude = 1747 n , longitude = 7857 e ) in november , 1995 .",
    "details of the telescope and the observational procedure have been given by @xcite .",
    "the photometer ( pht-12 ) consists of 12 composite silicon bolometers , each having a fov of 16 and arranged in a 3@xmath22 array for each band .",
    "these arrays are cooled to 0.3 k by liquid @xmath5he .",
    "the sky was chopped at 10 hz by wobbling the secondary mirror .",
    "the chopper throw was 42 along the cross - elevation axis .",
    "the same region of the sky was viewed simultaneously in two bands .",
    "the effective wavelengths for the two bands for a @xmath6 emissivity law and a temperature of 35 k are 205  and 138 .",
    "saturn was observed for absolute flux calibration @xcite as well as determination of the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) including the effect of sky chopping .",
    "the simultaneous mapping in the two fir bands was carried out by using raster scans in which the telescope was continuously moved along the cross - elevation axis and stepped in elevation .",
    "the chopped fir signals were gridded in a two dimensional sky matrix ( elevation @xmath2 cross - elevation ) with a cell size of 03@xmath2 03 .",
    "the observed chopped signal matrix was deconvolved using an indigenously developed procedure based on the maximum entropy method ( mem ) similar to that of @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the fwhm sizes of the deconvolved maps of the point - like source ( saturn ) are found to be 16@xmath219 and 16@xmath218 in the 138 and 205  bands respectively .",
    "an optical photometer was used at the cassegrain focal plane to improve the absolute positioning of the telescope during the flight .",
    "in addition for all the observations presented here , the signal from this optical photometer measured during the far - infrared scans have been used during offline analysis to further improve the aspect information .",
    "the absolute positional accuracy achieved in the fir maps is @xmath1 05 .",
    "limited regions of both orion a ( omc-1 & 2 ) and orion b ( ngc 2024 ) were also observed at 57  in an earlier flight ( november , 1990 ) of the tifr balloon - borne telescope , using a different photometer ( pht-2 ) .",
    "this two band photometer , pht-2 , was based on two liquid @xmath7he cooled ge(ga ) bolometers .",
    "the fir passbands were 4570  and 110160  with effective wavelengths 57   and 150  for an input source spectrum defined by a greybody of temperature 35 k and @xmath8 emissivity .",
    "a 24 ( dia ) region of the sky was simultaneously viewed in both the fir bands .",
    "more details of pht-2 can be found in @xcite . here ,",
    "only the observations at 57  are presented , since the other band is very similar to the shorter waveband of pht-12 which has better sensitivity .",
    "the pht-2 was calibrated by observing jupiter .",
    "some preliminary results from observations of the orion region have been presented by @xcite .",
    "the final results are presented here . the achieved angular resolution in the image processed maps",
    "is @xmath115 as determined from the observations of jupiter .      to supplement our balloon - borne observations ,",
    "we have used the iras survey data in all wavebands ( 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 ) for the regions mapped by us in orion b ( south ) .",
    "these data were hires processed @xcite at the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac , caltech ) for improving the angular resolutions of the raw maps .",
    "figure  [ bigorib ] and figure  [ oria1 ] respectively show the regions ( indicated by the dotted boundary ) in orion b ( south ) and orion a mapped at 205 and 138 .",
    "regions extending over @xmath1 42@xmath238  in orion a and @xmath1 38@xmath253  in orion b ( south ) have been observed at both these fir wavelengths .",
    "the 57  maps for both sources cover relatively smaller regions .",
    "reliable dust temperature t(138/205 ) maps for selected regions have been generated utilising the simultaneity of observation and nearly identical beams at 205 and 138 .",
    "the dust emissivity law has been assumed to be @xmath9 and the method used is briefly described in appendix 1 . for most star forming regions the emissivity exponent at longer wavelengths ( @xmath10 100 )",
    "is found to be between 1.5 to 2.5 and the calculated properties of most common types of dust grains @xcite show the same at these wavelengths .",
    "based on these facts we have chosen @xmath11 = 2 for deriving the t(138/205 ) distribution . considering the uncertainties in the measured flux densities and the wavelength regime probed ,",
    "the temperature computed has an uncertainty of @xmath1 @xmath122k between 14 k and 50 k and of @xmath1 @xmath125k between 50 and 70 k. the intensity ratio of our fir bands is rather insensitive to temperatures below 10 k and above 70 k. above 70 k the estimated temperature has an uncertainty of @xmath1 @xmath128k .",
    "the morphology of the spatial distribution of  is insensitive to the assumed value of @xmath11 .",
    "only the numerical values of  depend on @xmath11 , e.g. , a temperature of 15 k for @xmath11 = 2 corresponds to 17 k for @xmath11 = 1 and  = 30 k for @xmath11 = 2 corresponds to 50 k for @xmath11 = 1 .",
    "distribution of 150 , the optical depth at 150  for orion b has also been generated using these dust temperatures and @xmath11 = 2 .",
    "we have adopted a well - defined extraction algorithm to identify discrete sources in these maps .",
    "this algorithm is based on identification of a local maximum followed by a critical study of the growth curve of the integrated flux densities in consecutive annular rings with the maximum at the center .",
    "the reliability of the sources detected in each map has been ensured by the following procedure .",
    "the entire observation for each region has been split into two independent datasets ( by considering only the alternate scan lines in each raster ) and processed ( deconvolved ) separately to generate two maps .",
    "the peaks detected in both these maps within a predetermined positional error have been used to quantify the dynamic range and also to validate the detected sources .",
    "the final maps presented combine all data and positions of the  confirmed sources \" in the composite maps have been determined .",
    "these sources have signals more than 10 times the estimated noise level of the respective maps . in this paper",
    "the method of presenting the sources is as follows : peaks identified in any two tifr wavebands are associated if they lie within 1 . for association with iras ( hires ) sources",
    "the same parameter has been taken to be 15 .",
    "the coordinates quoted for a particular source are for the position of the peak at the longest ( tifr ) wavelength at which it is detected .",
    "figure  [ oria1 ] shows the 205 and 138  intensity distribution of the mapped region in orion a. the maps include the orion molecular clouds 1 , 2 , 3 and the source iras 05327 - 0457 .",
    "figure  [ oria58 ] shows the intensity map for a limited region in orion a at 57 .",
    "table  [ oriatab1 ] presents the coordinates and flux densities ( in a circle of 3  dia ) for all the discrete sources detected in the mapped regions of orion a at 205 and 138 . in the same table",
    "we also present the longer wavelength associations of these sources along with the measured flux densities at 1300  @xcite . for the discrete sources detected at 138 , 205 and 1300",
    "the dust temperature ( ) and the emissivity exponent ( @xmath11 ) have been determined by fitting a single temperature greybody spectrum .  and",
    "@xmath11 for a8 have been determined in a similar manner by using the flux densities measured at 450 , 790 and 1100  by @xcite along with those from the present work . for all other sources with",
    "flux densities measured only at 205 and 138   has been determined assuming @xmath11 = 2 . for a source not detected in any one of the wavebands ( marked by @xmath13 in table  [ oriatab1 ] ) ,",
    "we give the flux density obtained by integrating at the position of the source as detected in the other waveband(s ) .",
    "table  [ oriatab2 ] presents the positions , flux densities and associations of these sources detected at 57 .",
    "the source iras 05327 - 0457 has been studied in detail in the far - infrared by @xcite ; here we concentrate mainly on omc-1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "figure  [ oriatemp ] shows the temperature distribution as calculated from the observations at 205 and 138  for omc-1 and 2 .",
    "the temperature in omc-1 is as high as @xmath1 70 k close to the orion nebula .",
    "the temperature of the omc-1 and the bar region as calculated by @xcite from the ratio of 50 and 100  flux densities is found to be between 55 and 85 k. for the same region , the temperature calculated from our 205 and 138  fluxes is between 45 and 70k .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the longer wavelength observations presented here are tracing colder dust component as compared to those traced by the 50 and 100  observations",
    ". the temperature drops to an average of @xmath1 25 k in omc-2 and is as low as 15 k in omc-3 ( not shown in figure ) .",
    "the temperature map has been generated by assuming the dust to be optically thin but explicit calculation of optical depth ( at 150 ) very close to the global intensity peak of omc-1 , shows the regions to be optically thick . in such cases ,",
    "the temperatures quoted would be underestimates by as much as 5k .",
    "however , for omc-1 , 2 and 3 , the basic morphology of the isotherms remains unaltered .",
    "orion a is an ensemble of cores with a variety of temperatures , physical sizes and masses .",
    "this variety in physical conditions makes it conducive to harbouring stars in different stages of formation and evolution and hence makes it astrophysically interesting .",
    "the far - infrared maps presented here also support this variety by showing morphological characteristics strongly dependent on the dust temperature .",
    "while the 205 and 138  maps tracing colder dust detect fir emission from omc-2 and omc-3 very clearly , the 57  map fails to do so .",
    "omc-1 ( a8 in table  [ oriatab1 ] and # 1 in table [ oriatab2 ] ) is the brightest source detected at all wavelengths . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the submillimeter fluxes at 450 , 790 and 1100  @xcite have been used along with the 57 , 138 and 205  fluxes to determine  and @xmath11 for this source .",
    "the dust temperature obtained by this method is 68 k and the @xmath11 is 0.5 .",
    "if instead we do a similar fitting omitting the flux density at 57  we get  = 30 k and @xmath11 = 1.1 .",
    "thus the high temperature and low @xmath11 as presented in table  [ oriatab1 ] might be due to the effect of attempting to explain the emission over a wide range of wavelengths using a single temperature greybody spectrum .",
    "in reality there is probably a cold diffuse component of dust as well which contributes to the emission at longer wavelengths . in the omc-1 region",
    "the maps at 205 & 138  also detect the source a5 .",
    "although the position of this source at 205 and 138  differ by @xmath115 , we have associated the two , since there is no other nearby source of similar strength .",
    "we also note that the temperature of the source a5 is @xmath1 80 k , which is even higher than the temperature of a8 .",
    "the peaks # 2 and # 3 detected at 57  ( see table  [ oriatab2 ] ) are not detected at the longer wavelengths .",
    "the source # 2 is associated with the hii region m43 and the intensity distribution around it is similar to that observed at 60  by @xcite .",
    "the source # 3 is due to the heating of the dust in the photodissociation region around the trapezium stars .",
    "northern tip of the emission detected at 57  is clearly displaced to the east with respect to the integral shaped emission ridge detected in omc-2 and 3 .",
    "we can discern local enhancements in t(138/205 ) map close to the positions of the peaks # 2 and # 3 .",
    "these strongly indicate the existence of hotter dust towards the east .    of the observations presented here omc-2 and 3 are detected only at the longer wavelengths ( 205 and 138 ) . in omc-2",
    "we detect two sources ( a10 and a11 ) at 138  and only one source ( a12 ) at 205 .",
    "as suggested by table  [ oriatab1 ] the sources detected at our resolution are each associated with more than one submillimeter ( 1300 ) sources .",
    "we note that whereas a10 and a11 are associated with two mutually exclusive groups of submillimeter sources , a12 is associated with sources from both groups .",
    "the fact that we detect a10 and a11 only at 138  and a12 only at 205  could be due to the presence of a diffuse cold component which reduces the contrast between the sources and the intermediate region .",
    "this could effectively smoothen out the smaller peaks ( like a10 and a11 ) in this region , thus resulting in only one peak ( a12 ) at 205 .",
    "the flux densities at 1300  of the detected sub - mm sources have been calculated using the peak fluxes and size of the individual sources ( refer to table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "for each fir source the contribution at 1300  from all associated sources are combined and presented in table  [ oriatab1 ] .",
    "for all sources detected in omc-2 a single temperature greybody spectral fitting gives 20k@xmath0@xmath025k and 1.6@xmath0@xmath11 @xmath0 2.0 .",
    "both these are consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "recent radio observations at 3.6 cm by @xcite have detected sources coinciding with the peaks in dust emission .",
    "these associations are also presented in table  [ oriatab1 ] .",
    "the radio emission further substantiates that the sources detected in omc-2 though reasonably cold are not only regions of high density but also have ysos embedded in them .",
    "we have detected one source ( a9 ) in the omc-3 region .",
    "positionally it is coincident with the sub - mm source mms 6 @xcite , the latter being the brightest of all the sub - mm sources detected in omc-3 .",
    "the flux density at 1300  for the source a9 is estimated in the same manner as above .",
    "a greybody spectrum fitted to the measured flux densities gives  = 15 k and @xmath11 = 2.0 .",
    "a9 is thus the coldest source in orion a , both  and @xmath11 estimated here are consistent with @xcite and @xcite .    the total far - infrared luminosity has been estimated using the temperature map ( fig .  [ oriatemp ] ) for the region with omc-1 and omc-2 and the intensity maps of the same region .",
    "the dust emissivity exponent assumed for this calculation is 2.0 . from the fir observations presented here the total luminosity detected in omc-1 and 2",
    "is @xmath13.5@xmath210@xmath14 . for a similar region",
    "the luminosity based on 60 and 100  observations as given by @xcite is @xmath15@xmath210@xmath14 .",
    "the diffuse emission at these wavelengths has been calculated by subtracting the contribution of the discrete sources and is about 25% of the total luminosity .",
    "the molecular cloud omc-1 has long been the most extensively studied region in orion a. omc-2 and 3 have been studied only in the recent past and have been found to be rich and interesting as a star forming region .",

    "the sub - mm and iras point sources associated with these fir sources , along with the sub - mm flux densities measured at 1300  by @xcite are presented in the table  [ oribtab ] . in all 7 sources have been identified with sources in the iras point source catalog ( psc ) and 2 sources ( b3 and b9 ) have been found to have sub - millimeter ( 1300 ) counterparts . for sources not detected in one or two of the tifr bands ( marked by @xmath13 in table  [ oribtab ] ) we have presented the flux densities obtained by integrating in a circle around the position of the source as detected at the other wavelength(s ) .",
    "we have fitted a single temperature greybody spectrum for all sources for which measurement of flux densities at 3 or more wavelengths longer than 50  exist .",

    "the source b3 is quite cold with a maximum of 30 k and going below 15 k towards the edges .",
    "the 150  map ( figure  [ ngc2024temp ] ) shows very interesting structure close to the main source b9 .",
    "it distinctly shows that the region around b9 has an elongated structure with indications of at least 2 condensations .",
    "this structure is very similar to the structure shown by the nh@xmath16 column density map generated by @xcite .",
    "this very well substantiates the fact that these are indeed protostellar condensations since they are so luminous in the infrared as well .",
    "the cold source b3 is found to be mostly optically thin ( peak 0.07 ) at 150 .",
    "the total luminosity of the region calculated using the same method as for orion a ( section 3.1 ) is 1.0@xmath210@xmath14 .",
    "the diffuse emission contributes about 50% ( at both the wavelengths ) of the total luminosity .",
    "this is substantially larger than the value measured in orion a ( sec 3.1 ) and in other young galactic star forming regions ( @xmath1 35% in w31 ; * ? ? ?",

    "have been detected at 1300  by @xcite , but there is no iras detection of b13 . for both sources we have used the available flux densities at wavelengths longer than 60  to estimate  and @xmath11 from a single temperature greybody spectrum ( table  [ oribtab ] ) .",
    "the flatness of @xmath11 for b14 indicates the existence of dust components of at least two temperature ranges .",
    "the source b13 is found to be reasonably cold (  = 16 k ) , thus justifying it s non - detection in the iras wavebands .",
    "figure  [ ngc2023temp ] shows the t(138/205 ) and 150  maps for the region around ngc 2023 ( derived assuming @xmath11 = 2 ) .",
    "the t(138/205 ) map shows a peak which does not coincide with the intensity peaks at 205 and 138 .",
    "the t(138/205 ) peak , however coincides with the peak positions at 60 and 100 .",
    "the temperature of most of the region is around 30 k and in places goes down to values as low as @xmath1 20 k. the 150  map more or less traces the high intensity regions .",
    "the 150  displayed for regions which lie outside the contours of t(138/205 ) map are for an assumed temperature of 10 k ( not plotted in the t(138/205 ) map ) .",
    "ngc 2023 , being a well known reflection nebula with a photodissociation region ( excited by hd 37903 ) has been studied in various molecular and fine structure ( [ cii ] at 158 ) lines .",
    "the continuum maps presented in figure  [ ngc2023 ] are morphologically similar to the c@xmath21o map by @xcite and co ( j=2 - 1 ) map by @xcite .",
    "the [ cii ] observations at 158  by @xcite and @xcite detect emission which is approximately 25 % of the emission from ngc 2024 .",
    "the rise in temperature , t(138/205 ) , to the north - west of the main peak is explained by the presence of the exciting star hd 37903 .",
    "the total luminosity measured in this region is 1.5@xmath210@xmath5 .",
    "the diffuse emission contributes about 35% of the total emission , which is smaller than the contribution of diffuse emission around ngc 2024 .",
    "the total [ cii ] luminosity from the region as detected by @xcite is 7   and is equal to @xmath1 0.5% of the total fir luminosity estimated here .",
    "this is consistent with results from most of the galactic star forming regions as given by @xcite .",
    "detection of low temperature in the region around ngc 2023 alongwith emission in the far - infrared , support ongoing formation of low to intermediate stars in the region .",
    "indication of more than 50 % of the emission being in the condensations further indicates star formation in clumps in this region .",
    "in this paper we have presented large scale high angular resolution ( @xmath11 ) far - infrared ( 205 and 138 ) maps of the orion a and orion b ( south ) molecular clouds . for limited regions , maps at 57",
    "have also been presented .",
    "hires processed iras images at 100 and 60  of the orion b have been used for comparison .",
    "the regions covered include omc-1 , 2 , 3 in orion a and ngc 2024 and 2023 in orion b ( south ) . in all 15 condensations in orion a and 14 condensations in orion b ( south )",
    "have been identified . in omc-3",
    "the very cold source mms 6 @xcite was detected at both 205 and 138  and the temperature was determined to be @xmath115@xmath122 k. the far - infrared counterparts of the extremely dense cs cores @xcite lbs 33 , lbs 34 , lbs 36 and lbs 40 were detected in orion b ( south ) .",
    "the total far - infrared luminosity and the relative contribution of diffuse emission to the luminosity of these regions have also been quantified .",

    "as mentioned in section 2.1 the spatial intensity distribution in each band is gridded with pixels of size 03@xmath203 .",
    "only those pixels which have signals exceeding 5 times the noise level of the corresponding map are considered to be  valid \" for the purpose of finding the dust temperature distribution .",
    "each intensity map is first smoothed by taking a running average over 3@xmath23  valid \" pixels .",
    "this is done to be extremely conservative about the derived spatial structures in the temperature maps . since the two intensity maps refer to identical portions of the sky and the beams are also almost identical , a",
    " pixel by pixel \" ratio between the two maps gives reliable dust temperatures .",
    "thus for an assumed emissivity exponent ( @xmath11 ) the ratio of the flux densities at any two wavelengths is a function of the dust temperature only .",
    "the temperature is computed using a lookup table containing the calculated ratios of flux densities for various temperatures and an assumed @xmath11 .",
