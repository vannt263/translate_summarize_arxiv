    "whether the nucleon changes its fundamental properties while embedded in nuclear medium has been a long - standing question in nuclear physics , attracting experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is established as the theory of the strong nuclear force but the degrees of freedom observed in nature , hadrons and nuclei , are different from those appearing in the qcd lagrangian , quarks and gluons .",
    "there are no calculations available for nuclei within the qcd framework .",
    "nuclei are effectively and well described as clusters of protons and neutrons held together by a strong , long - range force mediated by meson exchange @xcite .",
    "distinguishing possible changes in the structure of nucleons embedded in a nucleus from more conventional many - body effects like meson - exchange currents ( mec ) , isobar configurations ( ic ) or final - state interactions ( fsi ) is only possible within the context of a model",
    ". therefore , interpretation of an experimental signature as an indication of nuclear medium modifications of the form factors makes sense only if this results in a more economical description of the nuclear many - body system . in this context , a calculation by lu _",

    "experimental constraints for possible proton medium modifications are available for both the electric form factor @xmath8 and the magnetic form factor @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the analysis of inclusive quasi - elastic scattering data on @xmath10he showed that the deviation of the cross section from scattering from free nucleons scales to a function of a single variable @xmath11 , the longitudinal momentum distribution .",
    "the @xmath11-scaling property is very sensitive to a change of nucleon radius .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath11-scaling regime suggests that the nucleon radius is changed by less than 3 % , at least for @xmath12 values larger than 1 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these measurements are in particular sensitive to the magnetic form factor .",
    "the interpretation of the coulomb sum - rule measurements , sensitive rather to the electric form factor , is controversial : on @xmath14he , good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained when using free - nucleon form factors @xcite and similar results were obtained on @xmath15c and @xmath16fe @xcite .",
    "however , a re - examination of the extraction of the longitudinal and transverse response functions on medium - weight and heavy nuclei ( @xmath17ca , @xmath18ca , @xmath16fe , @xmath19au , @xmath20pb and @xmath21u ) in the framework of the effective momentum approximation ( ema ) showed the quenching of the coulomb sum rule .",
    "this corresponds to a relative change of the proton charge radius of 13 @xmath22 4 % and it was interpreted as an indication for a change of the nucleon properties inside the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "polarization transfer experiments of the type @xmath23 have measured polarization - transfer ratios which for a proton target are directly proportional to the ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton .",
    "when such measurements are performed on a nuclear target , the polarization - transfer observables are sensitive to the form - factor ratio of the proton embedded in the nuclear medium . in the following",
    ", the results of @xmath0he@xmath24h experiments to study the proton knock - out process will be discussed .",
    "the existing measurements of the polarization transfer and the induced polarization in @xmath0he@xmath25h are the result of three experiments .",
    "the first measurement was performed at the mainz microtron ( mami ) at a @xmath12-value of 0.4 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the jefferson lab experiment e93 - 049 extended the mami measurements to higher @xmath12 : 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.6 and 2.6 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "our recent experiment e03 - 104 improved the @xmath12 coverage by adding two high precision measurements at @xmath12 = 0.8 and 1.3 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath13 @xcite . in view of decreasing other reaction mechanisms effects like mec and fsi ,",
    "the data were taken in quasi - elastic kinematics at low missing momentum with symmetry about the three - momentum - transfer direction . in these experiments ,",
    "two high - resolution spectrometers were used to detect the scattered electron and the recoil proton in coincidence .",
    "in addition , the missing - mass technique was used to identify @xmath2h in the final state .",
    "first hand , we measure the azimuthal angular distribution of recoil protons that scatter via spin - orbit nuclear interaction on the graphite analyzer in a focal - plane polarimeter ( fpp ) .",
    "the recoil proton polarization observables are then extracted from the azimuthal angular distributions taking into account the spin precession of the proton in magnetic fields @xcite .     from recoil - polarization experiments as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the mainz ( triangle ) and jefferson lab experiment e93 - 049 points along with preliminary results from experiment e03 - 104 ( filled circles ) are in very good agreement with previous polarization - transfer data . for the preliminary data of e03 - 104 at @xmath12 of 0.8 and 1.3 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath13 , the inner error bars are statistical while the outer error bars represent the total preliminary uncertainties .",
    "[ fig : gegm ] ]    the @xmath14he target was chosen because , in spite of its relative simplicity which allows for realistic microscopic theoretical calculations , it is rather dense , increasing possible medium modifications .",
    "in addition to the @xmath14he target , a @xmath26h target was also used in order to provide a base line for the comparison of in - medium to free proton polarizations .",
    "therefore , our results on the proton polarization transfer are expressed in terms of the polarization - transfer double ratio , where the helium polarization ratio is normalized to the hydrogen polarization ratio , measured in an identical setting :    @xmath27    as a by - product of the hydrogen measurements , the free proton form - factor ratio was extracted .",
    "figure [ fig : gegm ] shows our data to be in excellent agreement with previous polarization - transfer data @xcite .",
    "the e03 - 104 results at a @xmath12 of 0.8 and 1.3 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath13 are still preliminary and in the final results we expect the systematic uncertainties to be greatly reduced in order to take full advantage of the impressive statistics available .    in the polarization - transfer double ratio @xmath28 ,",
    "nearly all systematic uncertainties cancel : the polarization - transfer observables are not sensitive , to first order , to the instrumental asymmetries in the fpp , and their ratio is independent of the electron beam polarization and the graphite analyzing power .",
    "the small systematic uncertainties are due , mainly , to the uncertainties in the spin transport through the proton spectrometer but an extensive study is being performed in order to reduce their contribution to the total uncertainty .",
    "the induced proton polarization @xmath29 is a direct measure of final - state interactions .",
    "however , the @xmath29 extraction is greatly complicated by the presence of instrumental asymmetries in the fpp",
    ". typically , instrumental asymmetries are due to detector misalignments , detector inefficiencies or tracking algorithm issues .",
    "an ongoing effort aimed at devising a method to minimize instrumental asymmetries will make possible the precise extraction of the induced polarization @xmath29 from e03 - 104 measurements .",
    "the polarization - transfer double ratio is shown in figure [ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the preliminary data from e03 - 104 ( filled circles ) are consistent with our previous data from e93 - 049 @xcite and mami @xcite ( open symbols ) .",
    "the inner error bars are statistical only .",
    "the final systematic uncertainties from e03 - 104 are expected to be much smaller than the ones shown here .",
    "the data are compared to several theoretical calculations .     as a function of @xmath3 from mainz @xcite and jefferson lab experiment e93 - 049 @xcite ( open symbols ) along with preliminary results from experiment e03 - 104 ( filled circles ) ; @xmath28 is the ratio of transverse to longitudinal polarization of the recoiling proton in @xmath0he@xmath24h compared to the same ratio for @xmath30h@xmath31 .",
    "the baseline @xmath32 is the value of @xmath28 obtained in a plane - wave calculation , to account for the trivial effects of free _ vs. _ moving proton .",

    "[ fig : ratio ] ]    the madrid fully relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) @xcite is a state of the art calculation which gives a fully relativistic treatment to the initial bound and final outgoing proton wave functions and to the current operator .",
    "the fsi are incorporated using relativistic optical potentials that distort the final nucleon wave function .",
    "mec are not explicitly included in the madrid calculation .",
    "predictions by meucci _",
    "@xcite show that the two - body current ( the seagull diagram ) effects are generally small ( less than 3 % close to zero missing momenta ) and visible only at high missing momenta .",
    "the blue band for madrid rdwia calculation ( red band for rdwia + qmc ) is just a reflection of the theoretical uncertainties originating from different parameterizations of the current conservation prescriptions , cc1 and cc2 @xcite , or of the bound wave function .",
    "it can be seen that the madrid rdwia calculation ( blue band ) overpredicts the data by about 6 % . after including the density - dependent medium - modified form factors as predicted by lu _",
    "@xcite in the rdwia calculation ( red band ) , good agreement with the data is obtained .",
    "this agreement has been interpreted as possible evidence of proton medium modifications @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is based on the description of the data in a particular model in terms of medium modifications of nucleon form factors and requires excellent control of the reaction mechanisms like meson - exchange currents , isobar configurations , and final - state interactions .",
    "in fact , there is an alternative interpretation of the observed suppression of the polarization - transfer ratio within a more traditional calculation by schiavilla _",
    "@xcite ( cyan band ) .",
    "schiavilla s calculation uses free nucleon form factors and explicitly includes mec effects which are suppressing @xmath28 by almost 4  % .",
    "the fsis are treated within the optical potentials framework and include both a spin - dependent and spin - independent charge - exchange term which play a crucial role in his calculation of p@xmath33 .",
    "the spin - independent charge - exchange term is constrained by @xmath34 + @xmath2h @xmath35 @xmath36 + @xmath2he charge - exchange cross section data at kinetic lab energies of 57  mev and 156  mev .",
    "the spin - dependent charge - exchange term is taken to be real , with a depth parameter depending logarithmically on the kinetic lab energy , and with radius and diffuseness values of 1.2 fm and 0.15 fm , respectively . in schiavilla s model ,",
    "the final - state interaction effects suppress @xmath28 by an additional 6 % bringing this calculation also in good agreement with the data .",
    "it should be stated that charge - exchange terms are not taken into account in the madrid rdwia calculation .",

    "the induced polarization is small in this reaction .",
    "the sizable systematic uncertainties are due to possible instrumental asymmetries .",
    "dedicated data have been taken during e03 - 104 to study these and we hope to significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties in @xmath37 in the final analysis .",
    "the data are compared with the results of the calculations from the madrid group and schiavilla _ et al .",
    "_ at missing momenta of about zero .",
    "the data have been corrected for the spectrometer acceptance to facilitate this comparison .",
    "the data suggest that the measured induced polarization ( and thus the final - state interaction ) is overestimated in the model of schiavilla _",
    "et al._. note that the charge - exchange terms , particularly , the spin - dependent one , gives the largest contribution to schiavilla s calculation of p@xmath33 .",
    "the induced polarization proves to be sensitive to the choice of optical potential allowing this observable to be used to constrain theoretical models of fsi .    the results from laget s calculation @xcite are very similar to the pwia ones .",
    "laget s calculation overpredicts @xmath28 by almost 9 % but is in fairly good agreement with the induced polarization measurements indicating a much stronger @xmath12 dependence of fsi than the other models .",
    "a comparison of the model calculations in figure [ fig : ratio ] and figure [ fig : py ] shows that the in - medium form factors ( red band / curve ) mostly affect the ratio of polarization - transfer observables , not the induced polarization .",
    "it is a great advantage of e03 - 104 to have access to both the polarization - transfer and the induced polarization .    in summary ,",
    "polarization transfer in the quasi - elastic @xmath38 reaction is sensitive to possible medium modifications of the bound - nucleon form factor , while at the same time largely insensitive to other reaction mechanisms .",
    "currently , the @xmath0he@xmath39h polarization - transfer data can be well described by either the inclusion of medium - modified form factors or strong charge - exchange fsi in the models .",
    "however , these strong fsi effects may not be consistent with the induced polarization data .",
