    "galaxy evolution in dark halos is a central issue of cosmology in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .",
    "a critical key to the problem is to reveal what kind of dark halos host what kind of galaxies , specifically , the relationship between the mass of dark halos and fundamental quantities of galaxies such as star formation rate and stellar mass . the clustering strength of galaxies can be used to infer the mass of hosting dark halos , since in the standard theoretical framework of galaxy evolution , the large - scale distribution of galaxies is determined by the distribution of underlying dark halos , whose spatial clustering depends on their mass , with more massive halos having stronger spatial clustering @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have examined clustering properties of various high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "measuring clustering strength requires a large galaxy sample from a wide sky coverage .",
    "one considerable case in which the relationship between dark halos and galaxies has been successfully explored by means of clustering analysis is that of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "lbgs , which are selected by their continuum features in rest - frame uv spectra ( the lyman - break , the ly@xmath3 forest , and otherwise nearly flat continuum longward of the ly@xmath3 ) redshifted into optical bandpasses @xcite , are normal , young star - forming galaxies with modest dust extinction . requiring only optical imaging in a few bands ,",
    "the lbg selection method has yielded the largest and well - controlled samples of galaxies in the young universe at @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "lbgs are as numerous as the present - day galaxies , suggesting that they play a significant role in the early stage of galaxy evolution . for a review of lbgs including the history of their discovery , see @xcite .    an important piece of evidence which links the mass of hosting dark halos to physical properties of lbgs has been first discovered for the uv luminosity ; the clustering strength of lbgs increases strongly with uv luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since uv luminosity is sensitive to star formation rate , this implies that the star formation activity of lbgs is somehow controlled by the mass of dark halos which host them . to make a next step forward in our understanding of how the evolution of galaxies is related to the mass of dark halos",
    ", it would be necessary to examine the clustering strength as a function of other properties of galaxies like stellar mass , age , and dust extinction .",
    "in particular , stellar mass is a robust quantity in terms of the star formation history of galaxies compared to star formation rate , which can vary with time .",
    "this kind of analysis is , however , not easy because it requires deep and wide - field observational data covering wavelengths simultaneously from optical to near - infrared .",
    "only the dependence of clustering strength on rest - frame optical luminosity has been examined by @xcite for 300 galaxies at @xmath5 ( bx objects ) selected by uv wavelength in a similar manner to lbgs .",
    "recently , clustering properties of near - infrared selected galaxies at high redshift have been examined against various quantities of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the selection based on a near - infrared magnitude allows us to compile a nearly stellar mass - selected sample .",
    "however , the studies at high redshift on the basis of near - infrared selected galaxies have so far been inevitably limited to shallow ( @xmath6 ; * ? ? ? * ) or small - field ( @xmath7 arcmin@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",

    "this is due to the lower sensitivity and smaller area coverage of near - infrared cameras compared to optical ones .",

    "the redshift @xmath0 is the best target for such studies , since it is the highest redshift at which ground - based near - infrared imaging can access rest - frame optical wavelengths . to construct a large sample of lbgs at @xmath0 , we performed @xmath10-band imaging observation with subaru / suprime - cam in the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep field ( sxdf ) , which has a set of very deep optical multi - waveband imaging data from the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep survey ( sxds ; * ? ? ?",
