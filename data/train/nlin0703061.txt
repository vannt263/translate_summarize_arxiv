    ", this method uses the following iterations :    @xmath6    if this iteration converges , it usually does so very fast . because of that , and because of its simplicity , the newton method is one of the most frequently used numerical methods ever .",

    "the newton method fails if it hits a  zero of the derivative , or when the denominator in vanishes , unless the zero of the derivative corresponds to a multiple root .",
    "it is less commonly known that the newton method also fails to find a root if it forms a  multicycle .",
    "many textbooks that teach the newton method do not even mention this fact and those that do make the impression that multicycles in the newton method are a  rare and unimportant peculiarity . in reality",
    ", however , constructing examples that display multicycles is quite easy .",
    "a  reader may verify , for instance , that the points @xmath8 form a  stable @xmath9-cycle , shown in fig .",
    "[ stabilny ] , in the newton method applied to the polynomial @xmath10 .",
    "several questions then arise : how many such multicycles are there ?",
    "is it possible to encounter them in practical numerical applications of the newton method ?",
    "is there a connection between the multicycles and , say , basins of attraction ?",
    "we may regard consecutive iterations of the newton method as a dynamical system .",
    "multicycles generated by the newtonian iterations are the periodic orbits of this dynamics .",
    "since the seminal works of cvitanovic and co - workers @xcite , it is known that the unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) carry important information about the dynamical system that generates them . yet to extract this information , one needs to know at least how many periodic orbits there are .",
    "we shall discuss these questions in the case of @xmath7 being a polynomial .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we show that the newtonian iterations applied to a polynomial equation can generate infinitely many multicycles and we calculate the topological entropy associated with them . in section  [ x2 ]",
    "we discuss a particularly simple case of the polynomial @xmath11 .",
    "we show that dynamics resulting from the newton method , when restricted to the real axis , is chaotic and equivalent to the dynamics generated by a  piecewise linear map .",
    "we explicitly calculate the invariant density of the newtonian dynamics in this case .",
    "since the number of chaotic systems whose invariant densities are known analytically is fairly limited , this result is very interesting , at least from a  pedagogical point of view . in section  [ x2 m ]",
    "we partially generalize these results to the case of polynomials @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the appendix contains a proof of the theorem that we use to calculate the topological entropy .",
    "let @xmath14 be a complex polynomial of order @xmath15 :    @xmath16    suppose the polynomial has @xmath17 distinct roots , of order five , has _",
    "three _ distinct roots . ] .",
    "we solve the polynomial equation    @xmath18    numerically by newtonian iterations .",
    "this procedure defines a function @xmath19    consecutive iterates of   satisfy    @xmath20    with @xmath21 .",
    "the following theorem gives a more detailed characteristics of the iterates of the function  .",
    "it is pivotal in our subsequent discussion :    [ twierdzenie1 ] @xmath22 @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are polynomials of order @xmath26 , where @xmath17 is the number of _ distinct _ roots of the polynomial @xmath14 .    an elementary , but rather lenghty and technical , proof of this theorem is given in the appendix .",
    "theorem  [ twierdzenie1 ] is very useful when we consider multicycles generated by the function  .",
    "specifically , all points belonging to a  @xmath27-cycle satisfy    @xmath28    using eq .",
    "we get that either @xmath29 , which means that @xmath30 is a fixed point of the function  , or that    @xmath31    this equation has @xmath26 solutions on the complex plane .",
    "if @xmath27 is prime , then there are @xmath32 different @xmath27-cycles .",
    "if @xmath27 is not prime , we need to subtract `` spurious '' @xmath27-cycles ; for example , two rounds over a 2-cycle can be mistakenly taken for a  4-cycle .",
    "eventually , for the number of @xmath27-cycles that are generated by the newton method applied to a polynomial with @xmath17 distinct zeros , we obtain    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a set of all proper divisors of @xmath27 ( if @xmath27 is prime , @xmath35 ) .",
    "these multicycles are periodic orbits of the dynamics generated by successive iterations of the function . a  limited number of the multicycles may be stable , but as in any dynamical system , an overwhelming majority of them are unstable and form the unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) of the dynamics .",
    "the number of multicycles grows very rapidly with @xmath27 ; for example , if @xmath36 , there are approximately @xmath37 @xmath38-cycles . to quantify this observation , we can calculate the topological entropy @xcite of the dynamics generated by @xmath39 by appropriately counting the upos @xcite :    @xmath40    @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "it is well known that if a map acting on an interval has a positive topological entropy , it is chaotic @xcite . in a more general setting , if the topological entropy is positive , we can expect _ some _ form of chaotic behaviour to show up in the dynamics .",
    "we can see that the newton method , when applied to a  polynomial equation , leads to an extremely rich structure of multicycles .",
    "but where are they ? if any of them is stable , as in our example in the introduction , it can show up in a practical application of the newtonian iterations .",
    "the unstable majority live on fractal boundaries between basins of attraction .",
    "it is the dynamics on these boundaries that is the chaotic behaviour whose presence is indicated by a  positive value of the topological entropy .",
    "it is also interesting to see that if a polynomial has multiple roots , it has less multicycles than a  polynomial of the same order and with all roots distinct : it is the number of _ distinct _ roots , rather than the degree of the polynomial or the number of all the roots , that determines the value of the topological entropy .",
    "in general , multicycles generated by the newton method live on complicated geometric objects somewhere on the complex plane .",
    "there is , however , one nontrivial example where the locale of the multicycles can be pinpointed quite accurately .",
    "consider the equation    @xmath43    it generates the following newtonian dynamics :    @xmath44    it can be proved that if we start with any @xmath5 such that @xmath45 , the newtonian iterations converge to @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , if we start with @xmath47 , the newtonian iterations converge to @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , all the multicycles of the function and all the points that eventually end up on them must lie on the real axis .    , but from time to time it makes large excursions , and then slowly relaxes towards zero . if one waits long enough , arbitrarily large excursions can be observed . ]",
    "we shall , therefore , discuss properties of the map restricted to the real axis :    @xmath49    formally speaking , this map results from an attempt to find the real zeros of the equation @xmath0 .",
    "there are no such zeros , but that does not necessarily mean that properties of the map are not interesting . fig .",
    "[ fig - trajektoria ] shows a  typical trajectory generated by this map .",
    "we shall list the most important properties of the map :    * this function is singular in @xmath50 and it increases monotonically for both @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it does not have a fixed point .",
    "* each point has two preimages .",
    "the preimages of a  point @xmath53 satisfy @xmath54 * there are countably many multicycles ( upos ) . for each multicycle , there are countably many points that eventually fall onto it .",
    "* @xmath50 corresponds to the escape to infinity .",
    "there are countably many points that are eventually mapped into @xmath50 and escape to infinity . *",
    "the union of all the multicycles , points that lead to them , and points that eventually escape to infinity , is also countable and dense in @xmath55 .",
    "this leaves us with uncountably many points that neither escape , nor fall on a multicycle , but form a  `` truly chaotic '' orbit of the dynamical system  .",
    "simulations suggest that the map has an invariant density that does not depend on the starting point , provided this point does not escape to infinity .",
    "this eliminates only countably many points , and in practice only three of them : @xmath56 ( the preimages of @xmath57 are irrational and inaccessible in numerical simulations ) . indeed , to compute the invariant density , denoted here by @xmath58",
    ", we use the frobenius - perron equation @xcite :    @xmath59    using eq .  , this equation takes the explicit form    @xmath60    it can be verified by a direct substitution that the lorentzian distribution    @xmath61    solves the frobenius - perron equation .",
    "thus the map joins the elite club of maps whose invariant densities are known explicitly .",
    "slowly decaying tails of the invariant density explain the large deviations from zero made by the chaotic trajectory .",
    "it is interesting to see that the stereographic projection convertss the function into a piecewise linear map on the unit interval .",
    "if we substitute    @xmath62    we obtain    @xmath63    given the periodicity of the trigonometric function , we can see that the map is equivalent to    @xmath64    properties of the map are easy to find and they nicely illustrate the multicycles .    * the map is chaotic with the lyapunov exponent @xmath65 .",
    "this map has a flat invariant density , @xmath66 , @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "* @xmath68 is the fixed point of the map .",
    "the fixed point corresponds to an escape to infinity in the language of @xmath53 given by . *",
    "if we represent any @xmath67 $ ] by its binary expansion , the map acts on it by ( i ) the binary shift , ( ii ) rejecting the highest bit , and ( iii ) flipping the remaining highest bit .",
    "for example , + @xmath69 + where the subscript indicates a binary expansion .",
    "thus , all points with finite binary expansions eventually converge to @xmath70 , i.e. , escape to infinity , points with periodic ( starting form some point ) binary expansions belong to multicycles or settle on one after a  finite number of steps , and points with nonperiodic , infinite binary expansions lie on the chaotic trajectory .",
    "thus the rational numbers either escape to infinity under the action of , or end up on multicycles . as the transformation maps rational numbers from the unit interval to irrational numbers in @xmath71 , encountering a  true multicycle of during a  computer simulation is impossible",
    ". however , the fact that computer calculations are performed with a finite precision , leads to the conclusion that in a  computer experiment , the map behaves as if it were periodic , with a  fairly large period , almost regardless of the starting point .",
    "this is a  well known fact about pseudo - random sequences .",
    "* we can count the @xmath27-cycles by counting nontrivially different binary sequences of the length @xmath27 .",
    "for example , there are @xmath72 possibilities of distributing @xmath8 among @xmath27 sites .",
    "two constant sequences must be excluded , and as all cyclic permutations are equivalent , we arrive , if @xmath27 is prime , on @xmath73 .",
    "( if @xmath27 is not prime , the result of @xmath73 is fractional . )",
    "this result , and its generalizations to non - prime @xmath27 s , are the same as those given by eq .   with @xmath74 .",

    "the equation    @xmath76    is a natural generalization of the equation .",
    "however , the multicycles generated by the newtonian iterations resulting from the equation are not restricted to the real axis . indeed , in case of eq .",
    "the newton method generates identical dynamics on each line @xmath77 on the complex plane , with @xmath78 , but there are also fractal boundaries between the basins of attraction that do not lie on these lines and , apparently , a  majority of the multicycles are located there . if the newtonian iterations are restricted to the real axis , they are the iterates of the function    @xmath79    this function has _",
    "qualitatively _ the same properties as the function : it is singular at @xmath50 , grows monotonically from @xmath80 to @xmath81 in both domains @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and each point has two preimages .",
    "therefore , the number of its multicycles ( again , on the real axis ) must be the same as that of .",

    "the tails agree perfectly with the theoretical prediction .",
    "simulations show that for all @xmath13 , the invariant density is bimodal , and that the valley between the peaks gets deeper as @xmath91 increases .",
    "we have shown that the newton method , when applied to a polynomial equation that has more than one distinct solution , generates infinitely many multicycles , and we have calculated the topological entropy associated with them .",
    "we have also shown that the map is chaotic , equivalent to a  piecewise linear map on the unit interval , and we have explicitly found its invariant density .",
    "this result is interesting by itself as the number of maps with analytically known invariant densities is very limited . because the invariant density in question coincides with the lorentzian probability distribution",
    ", one could use the function as a  basis of a pseudo - random generator of the latter .    from a practical point of view , hitting an unstable multicycle is virtually impossible , although it is well known that starting the newtonian iterations in a close vicinity of a fractal boundary between the basins of attractions , where the unstable multicycles live , can slow down the convergence significantly . in some cases , stable multicycles",
    "can also appear and they can prevent the newton method from converging to a  root ; the polynomial presented in fig .",
    "[ stabilny ] provides one such example",
    ". it would be interesting to see what are the criteria for the existence of stable multicycles . in practice , however , if a multicycle appears to form , the newtonian iterations should be interrupted by a couple of steps taken with a  different method , and with the damped newton method in particular .",
    "this usually breaks the multicycle that has started to form , but can lead to new multicycles in their own right . discussing this point goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we should finally mention that the newton method is _ not _ the best method for a  numerical search for zeros of a  polynomial .",
    "there are other algorithms , better tailored to polynomials . from those the laguerre method @xcite , coupled with the deflation of the polynomial , is now regarded as the method of choice . despite many arguments in favour of the latter method , the newton method is probably most commonly used for the task , and this is why a  study of its upos structure is , in our opinion , important .",
