    "positronium ( ps ) , the electron - positron bound state , is a purely leptonic system . the energy difference between ortho - positronium ( o - ps , @xmath1 state ) and para - positronium ( p - ps , @xmath2 state ) , hyperfine splitting of positronium ( ps - hfs ) , is a good target for precise bound state qed verification .",
    "the ps - hfs value is approximately 203 ghz ( 0.84 mev ) , which is significantly larger than hydrogen hfs ( 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "one reason for the large ps - hfs is the quantum oscillation : o - ps @xmath3 o - ps ( o - ps has the same quantum number as a photon ) . since some hypothetical particles ( such as an axion or a millicharged particle )",
    "can participate in the quantum oscillation , resulting in a shift of ps - hfs value , its precise measurement provides a probe for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "measurements of the ps - hfs have been performed in 70 s and 80 s with the combined precision of 3.3 ppm@xcite , the results were consistent with 1st order calculation of the qed available at that time .",
    "however , the 2nd and 3rd order corrections have been calculated recently , with the new prediction of 203.39169(41 ) ghz@xcite , deriving from the measured value of 203.38865(67 ) ghz by 3.9@xmath0 .",
    "this discrepancy may come from new physics or the common systematic errors in the previous measurements .    in all previous measurements ,",
    "the ps - hfs transition was not directly measured , since 203 ghz was too high frequency to produce and control .",
    "they measured zeeman splitting of o - ps instead .",
    "a static magnetic field makes zeeman mixing between @xmath4 state of o - ps and p - ps , the resultant energy level of @xmath4 state becomes higher than @xmath5 ( zeeman splitting ) .",
    "this zeeman splitting , which is proportional to the hfs energy level , is a few ghz frequency if @xmath6 1 tesla magnetic field is applied .",
    "they applied uniform magnetic field in rf cavities where positronium was introduced , causing zeeman transition and resultant o - ps to p - ps transition .",
    "however , uncertainty ( especially non - uniformity ) of the static magnetic field , which is very sensitive to the measured hfs value , can be a large source of systematic error .",
    "in contrast to the indirect method , we plan to directly measure the hfs transition , which does not need a static magnetic field , and is thus free from the systematic error from the field . to cause the direct transition",
    ", a powerful 203 ghz radiation field is necessary .",
    "we are developing sub - thz to thz light source called a gyrotron , and also a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity to accumulate sub - thz photons for the direct hfs measurement .",

    "the gyrotron@xcite is a novel high power radiation source for sub - thz to thz frequency region .",
    "the structure of gyrotrons is shown in figure [ gyschematic ] .",
    "the electrons are produced and accelerated at the dc electron gun , concentrated and rotated as cyclotron motion in the superconducting magnet .",
    "the cyclotron frequency @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath10 is the electron rest mass and @xmath11 is the relativistic factor of the electron .",
    "a cavity is placed at the maximum magnetic field , whose resonance frequency is tuned just to the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the electrons stimulate resonance of the cavity and produce coherent photons at the cavity .",
    "the photons are guided to the output port through the window , while electrons are dumped at the collector .",
    "we developed a gyrotron operating at @xmath12 ghz with @xmath13 tesla , @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ gypicture ] shows the gyrotron .",
    "the obtained radiation power is 609 w at the window , which is reduced to 440 w during transmission through the waveguide system to the positronium cavity .",
    "the spectral width is determined by @xmath9 uniformity and @xmath11 spread by thermal distribution of electrons , and is expected to be less than mhz , which is narrow enough to make resonance at the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "measurement results of a similar gyrotron shows the spectral width is less than 10 khz@xcite .",
    "the frequency can be tuned by changing the @xmath11 factor with different acceleration of electrons , but the tuning range is limited by the resonant width of the cavity to several handreds of megahertz .",
    "off-203 ghz radiation can be obtained by using different resonance mode of the cavity . in our gyrotron ,",
    "nearest resonant frequency to 203 ghz is at around 199 ghz .",
    "the radiation power of the gyrotron will be monitored to account for corrections to the transition probability .",
    "photons produced at the gyrotron are transported and accumulated in a cavity to cause the ps - hfs transition . since 203 ghz ( @xmath15 mm ) photons can be treated optically at the centimeter ( or larger ) size scale , we plan to use a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "it consists of two opposing mirrors to confine photons between them . unlike rf cavities ,",
    "the confinement in the fabry - perot cavity is 1-dimensional while the other four sides are open .",
    "we use a metal - mesh mirror on the input side of the cavity and use a copper concave mirror on the other side .",

    "ohmic loss occurs at the cavity mirror , which is around 0.15% at the copper mirror and more at the mesh mirror .",
    "the ohmic loss at the mesh mirror varies by mesh parameters , which can be calculated by field simulation ( see table [ meshparam ] ) .",
    "input coupling is the fraction of input power introduced to the cavity mode , an important parameter to introduce photons efficiently into the cavity . in our cavity ,",
