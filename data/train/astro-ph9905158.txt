    "since the discovery of jets in ss433 in 1978 , there has been discussion about their uniqueness . by now the zoo of various jets has enlarged .",
    "there have already been detected hundreds relativistic jets of agns , low velocity jets of young stars and a dozen jets of compact stars .",
    "jets of ss433 stand out among the others for they harbour cool clouds within the relativistic flow .",
    "it is not clear , however , how the clouds could survive in the relativistic jets and be observed .",
    "it is also worth mentioning , that the thermal fraction is likely to be dominant in the jets of ss433 . on the contrary",
    ", the lack of observational evidence of thermal gas in agn jets strongly restricts its volume - filling factor ( @xmath2 ) and implies that it can not be important in the energy budget of these jets ( @xcite ) .",
    "these peculiarities make the jets of ss433 unique .",
    "jets of ss433 are highly collimated , @xmath3.4 , mildly relativistic , @xmath4 cms@xmath5 , and powerful , with kinetic luminosity @xmath6 ergs@xmath5 .",
    "they appear from funnels of the supercritical accretion disk and follow its precession rotation with a half opening angle of about @xmath7 and a period of @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ wall ] ) . at the distance of a few",
    "@xmath9 cm the jets rapidly cool and radiate in the x - ray domain .",
    "the x - ray emission does not show any structure of the jets .",
    "therefore , the x - ray jets are thought to be continuous ( @xcite ) . by contrast",
    ", the optical jets are observed as fragmented ( @xcite ) .",
    "their clumpness may be roughly deduced from energetic considerations .",
    "the gas must be dense enough to radiate the bulk of the emission : @xmath10 and mass loading of the jet by dense gas must approximately satisfy : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the volume of the jet , @xmath13 is its length , @xmath14 is electron density , @xmath15 is the @xmath16 emission rate .",
    "thus , one finds that @xmath17 @xmath18 and a volume - filling factor of @xmath19 for appropriate parameters : luminosity in @xmath16 line @xmath20 ergs@xmath5 , total jet kinetic luminosity @xmath21 ergs@xmath5 , @xmath22 erg@xmath23s@xmath5 , @xmath24 cm  length of _ e_-folding @xmath16 line brightness .",
    "it seems that the jets become lumpy in the gap between the x - ray part and the optical jet beginning at about @xmath25 cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gas could condense there due to a thermal instability as brinkmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown in a simulation of the thermal evolution of the x - ray jets .",
    "the instability takes place only in the interior jet , until a distance of @xmath26 cm .",
    "the parameters of the clouds found in their work are close to those obtained by panferov & fabrika ( @xcite ) from the balmer decrements of the jets : hydrogen density @xmath27 @xmath18 and size of the clouds @xmath28 cm .",
    "it should be noted that these parameters as well as the filling factor @xmath29 found there are more appropriate for the distance of maximum optical brightness of the jets @xmath30 cm .",
    "these parameters will be representative ones in what follows .",
    "the clouds are grouped in clusters with sizes of about @xmath9 cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "still bigger structures are quite possible in the jets as may be deduced from the structure of the jet emission line .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( @xcite ) consider cloudy structure of the jets as a result of a temporal switch on and off of conditions for thermal instability .",
    "they found that the parameters of ss433 are just suitable for the instability to occur .",
    "however , the instability can work with a wide range of the parameters and in ss433 jets the conditions for cloud generation exist rather continuously in time . indeed",
    ", the data on optical emission of the jet ( e.g. @xcite ) demonstrate that the generation of the clouds in the jets is continuous and the disappearance of the optical jets happens very rarely .",
    "the intermittent structure of the jets is natural if the radiating clouds form in such _ in situ _",
    "variable process as the thermal instability .",
    "the optical jets terminate at a distance of about @xmath31 cm ( @xcite ) and then are observed to be quasi - continuous in radio ( @xcite ) . it is observed as separated emission peaks grow and decay at a unchanged wavelength reflecting an evolution of `` bullet '' along the jets ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the clouds form in the interior jets and further exist a long time giving a signature of the optical jets .",
    "the actual problem is how do the clouds evolve and survive in the relativistic jets ? as long as the clouds are involved in a motion through a medium , that is , the dense wind of the accretion disk , the applied ram pressure leads to gas - dynamical instabilities that try to disrupt the clouds on a crushing time scale ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a cloud density , @xmath34 is a wind density . for the clouds of the jets of ss433 this time is on the order of @xmath35 s. besides this",
    ", the clouds undergo an evaporation in the hotter intercloud medium",
    ". the evaporation characteristic time may be rather short , too ( see eq.([tev ] ) ) .",
    "namely the capability of the clouds to survive permits us opportunity to observe the jets of ss433 in the optical . in this paper",
    "we show that the collisional interaction that seems to be the destructive one is a most necessary condition of the clouds existence .    in sect.2",
    "we show that the collisional interaction may be comparable or even more essential than radiation for the thermal state of the clouds . although this has been concluded by another authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we use here the last data on the jets parameters ( @xcite ) and on parameters of uv radiation of the system",
    " a possible source of heat of the clouds ( @xcite ) . in sect.3",
    "we discuss evolution and confinement of the clouds .",
    "there are two main ways to heat the clouds : by interaction of jets with the gaseous wind of the supercritical accretion disk and by radiation of the system ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we consider competition of these two mechanisms .",
    "as long as the cloud sound - crossing time is shorter than the dynamical time - scale @xmath36 of the jet , the clouds are in pressure equilibrium with surroundings",
    ". the influence of ram pressure of the wind on the equilibrium is most essential ( see sect.3 ) .",
    "density in the wind scales as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radial distance from the source of the jets . under plausible conditions of approximate constancy of temperature and mass of a cloud",
    "this implies the following dynamical dependences of cloud parameters : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and we have used the values of the cloud parameters at @xmath41 , given in sect.1 . in what follows , we assume these to be valid everywhere along the optical jets .",
    "let us compare the rates of cloud heating by the impinging gas and by radiation .",
    "the jets sweep out the gas of the wind due to the change of the jet direction in the course of the precession and nodding motions and a small amplitude jitters of unclear nature ( @xcite ) .",
    "the energy deposition into a cloud by crossing protons with energy @xmath42 depends on the collisional thickness , measured by the ratio @xmath43 , where @xmath44 @xmath45 is the column density of the cloud , and @xmath46 is the column density required to stop a proton .",
    "the rate of energy loss of a high energy proton in an ionized gas is approximately ( @xcite ) : @xmath47 for temperature @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the factor @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the coulomb logarithm . in an ionized plasma",
    "almost all of the lost energy goes into heating the electron gas .",
    "the stopping column density of a proton with energy @xmath52 mev is : @xmath53 when @xmath54 , which is satisfied for the entire jet ( see eq.([colden ] ) ) , the cloud heating rate by the fast protons is : @xmath55 this is lowest estimate .",
    "the magnetic field may be amplified to an equipartition value at the surface of a cloud moving through a medium with a weak magnetic field ( @xcite ) . for assumed in eq.([mf ] ) magnetic field the gyro - radius of a 32 mev proton is @xmath56 cm .",
    "this is smaller than the clouds radius , therefore the trajectories of protons may be tangled and the heat input boosted .",
    "the clouds could also be heated by the collimated radiation from funnels of the accretion disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and by the disk uv radiation .",
    "the heating is realized by @xmath57-electrons  high energy electrons broken away from an atom due to ionization . already for ionization degree @xmath58 , almost all the energy of @xmath57-electrons is utilized in the heating of the electron gas of a cloud .",
    "we take into account radiation only with frequency beyond the lyman edge .",
    "a cloud intercepts radiation flux with density @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is radius of the radiation source , @xmath61 is the planck function , and relativistic factor @xmath62 is omitted .",
    "the part of the radiation which is absorbed is @xmath63 , where the optical thickness is @xmath64 , the ionized fraction is @xmath65 .",
    "then the radiative heating rate of one cloud is : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is frequency of lyman edge .",
    "we adopt here @xmath68 @xmath69 , for photon with energy @xmath70 in the range 13.6 ev  12.4 kev , for cosmic abundances ( @xcite ) .",
    "parameters of the collimated radiation are not well known since its orientation to the earth is unfavourable . here",
    "we adopt rather rough estimates for its luminosity @xmath71 ergs@xmath5 and temperature @xmath72 kev ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". then the radius of a source of the collimated radiation , in blackbody approach , is @xmath73 cm .",
    "the supercritical accretion disk is a source of near isotropic uv radiation , its parameters in blackbody approach are : @xmath74 k , @xmath75 cm ( @xcite )",
    ". for given parameters and @xmath76 eq.([hr ] ) gives @xmath77 , i.e. heating by uv radiation of the disk could dominate heating by the x - ray collimated radiation .",
    "this ratio might be bigger because the clouds have rather @xmath78 for the uv radiation , however situation is complicated by the screening of the clouds in a jet .    the cross - over path length of some particle moving in the direction of the jet velocity across the jet is determined by the curvature of the jet .",
    "the motion of the jet caused by nodding is more rapid than that caused by precession and its rate is @xmath79 rads@xmath5 ( @xcite ) . using this rate we obtain the cross - over length for a jet with fixed pattern @xmath80 cm , with accuracy of factor 2 .",
    "column density along this path is : @xmath81 consequently , we have @xmath82 everywhere in the optical jets and the jets are transparent for the rapid protons .",
    "so , the screening effect is not important for the collisional heating .",
    "meanwhile the screening factor of clouds in the jet @xmath83 may be essential for the uv radiation .",
    "we now determine @xmath84 as the column density of a cloud layer where @xmath85 for the uv radiation .",
    "then the screening factor for the uv radiation is @xmath86 and essentially depends on the ionization degree .",
    "therefore we will consider heating @xmath87 of the cloud by uv radiation as an upper limit of radiative heating ( [ hr ] ) .",
    "really , this heating is bigger than mean heating rate of one cloud , on average over the whole jet , in @xmath88 times ; the opacity of the jet to uv radiation causes a dominance of the collimated radiation in the heating of screened clouds .",
    "the ratio of the heating rate from fast protons ( eq.([hc ] ) ) to the radiation heating rate ( eq.([hr ] ) ) is : @xmath89 where we have used the reduced form of eq.([hr ] ) for @xmath90 , substituting 1 instead of @xmath91 , and used density of wind of the accretion disk : @xmath92 the mass loss rate and wind velocity are taken to be @xmath93y ( @xcite ) and @xmath94 km / s ( from the width of the emission lines ) respectively .",
    "thus the heating of the jet by fast protons is comparable at least with the radiation heating .",
    "their rates become equal at a distance @xmath95 cm , until which the main bulk of the heat input into the jet takes place and equals to 64% of the whole input given by eq.([hj ] )",
    ". the collisional heating may be rather much bigger than radiative one , because the value of @xmath96 is overestimated approximately in @xmath97 times due to the screening effect .",
    "this idea concerning the collisional heating of the jet clouds is observationally supported : @xmath16 emission of the jets is anisotropic , the maximum of its directional pattern is directed to side of jet movement ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that some screening effect exists for the impinging protons .",
    "it is possible if a magnetic field tangles trajectories of the protons in a cloud and the stopping column density @xmath46 becomes smaller than that given by eq.([ns ] ) .",
    "however , the directional pattern can not be explained straightforwardly as a result of a head - on collision of the clouds with the wind , because the maximum is inclined to the jet axis .",
    "the inclination of the head maximum is towards the direction of the precessional motion and is about @xmath98 to the jet axis .",
    "this rather shows that a maximum outcome of the emission line radiation is from jet sides moving in the wind .    as a result of collision with the wind a cloud decelerates at a rate",
    ": @xmath99 here we used @xmath41 as the lower limit of the integration because evolution of the jet at distances @xmath100 is not well established .",
    "the deceleration ( [ dec ] ) agrees well enough with the observed value of the deceleration @xmath101 ( @xcite ) .",
    "jets sweep out wind gas with a pattern speed of @xmath102",
    ". then the rate of the heating of the whole of optical jet provided by fast protons is : @xmath103 this integral is calculated numerically and dependence of @xmath104 on a geometry of the precessing conical jet is taken into account .",
    "the calculated value of the whole heat @xmath105 agrees with the observable radiation output of the jets in h@xmath106 line @xmath107 ergs@xmath5 ( @xcite ) : a part @xmath108 of absorbed energy is emitted in h@xmath106 .",
    "the small clouds in question would be overheated and their h@xmath106 radiation would have ceased unless the clouds are dense enough to establish a balance between radiative losses and the heating by the fast protons . in the temperature region near @xmath109 k , which is the threshold ionization temperature of hydrogen ,",
    "the efficiency of the radiative cooling @xmath110 strongly depends on temperature and changes by 3 orders of magnitude : @xmath111  @xmath112 ( @xcite ) . from this and eq.([dyn ] ) one finds limits of possible values of the radiative energy loss of the clouds , corresponding to the end and the beginning of the jet : @xmath113 since limits on the heating rate @xmath114 from eq.([hc ] ) correspond to : @xmath115 for the jet end and beginning respectively , the heating rate never can exceed the cooling capability , given by inequality ( [ clim ] ) , and the thermal balance of the clouds can be maintained near a temperature of @xmath109 k throughout the whole of the optical jets .",
    "the lifetime of the clouds in the jets , about 4 days , is much longer than the cloud sound - crossing time .",
    "therefore , the clouds must be in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium and should not be exposed to destructive processes .",
    "the pressure of the ionizing radiation @xmath116 dyn is much smaller than the gas pressure in a cloud @xmath117 dyn , where we use a temperature of @xmath118 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , radiation is not important for dynamical balance of a cloud .",
    "the pressure equilibrium of clouds with surroundings imposes constraints on density @xmath119 and on temperature @xmath120 k of the surrounding gas at a distance @xmath41 . in this hot medium",
    "the clouds will evaporate with a timescale of : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the mass of the cloud , @xmath123 is sound velocity in the hot medium , @xmath124 is some function ( given by equation ( 62 ) in @xcite ) , which is @xmath125 for our case .",
    "the evaporation of the clouds with so short timescale contradicts to the lifetime of the clouds .",
    "therefore the clouds evaporation must be suppressed . on the other hand ,",
    "the ram pressure of the wind is important in pressure balance of the clouds : @xmath126 .",
    "ram pressure of the wind gas seems to be strongest and must govern the clouds pressure . but again , gas - dynamical instabilities are capable of disrupting the clouds on a timescale given by eq.([tcr ] ) .",
    "this is the puzzle of ss433 jets : how can thermal gas survive there ?",
    "the optical jets end at a distance of about @xmath127 cm .",
    "further , at a distance @xmath128 cm , the jets brighten in radio which is a consequence of jet expansion ( @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that the expansion is connected with the termination of the optical jet .",
    "as long as the jets precess and move through the dense wind of the accretion disk they sweep out the wind gas to the surface of the precession cone . after the passage of the jets",
    "the wind fills the jet channels and during the precessional period a region of length @xmath129 cm can be refilled .",
    "consequently , at distances larger than the sweep - out distance the lobe along the precession cone surface is empty ( see fig .  [ wall ] ) .",
    "thermal diffusion of wind gas is not capable of filling the lobe : @xmath130 at @xmath131 .",
    "the dependences ( [ dyn ] ) of the clouds parameters on a distance and the clouds heating balance have not peculiarities in point @xmath132 . but external to the clouds conditions abruptly change there .",
    "possibly , this forces the confinement of the clouds to switch off and results in the expansion of the jet .    from laws in eqs.([dyn ] ) we derive the approximate size of the cloud @xmath133 cm and the filling factor @xmath134 at the end of the optical jets . with these parameters",
    "the clouds start to expand freely and fill the whole volume of the jets in time : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is sound velocity in the cloud .",
    "the estimated time of expansion corresponds well to the time interval required for the jet to move between the end of the optical part and the radio brightening zone .",
    "the last could develop due to the increase of the rate of generation of relativistic particles , when the clouds expand and turbulence is enhanced .",
    "the _ coincidence _ of lengths of the optical jets and the sweep - out zone indicates that ram pressure of the wind gas causes confinement of the clouds .",
    "the ram pressure switch off is equivalent to a `` hard wall '' which crushes the clouds .",
    "however , the ram pressure by itself is not able to prevent clouds from stripping off the gas and thermal evaporation . on the contrary , it seems from eq.([tcr ] ) that the higher the ram pressure the shorter the lifetime of a cloud . in reality , ionized clouds and their surroundings harbour magnetic fields , which should be important for stability of the clouds .",
    "the magnetic field inferred from radio observations is @xmath137 g at the distance of radio brightening ( @xcite ) .",
    "magnetic flux constancy implies that @xmath138 scales as @xmath139 and we assume magnetic field in the jet is : @xmath140 this field could not confine the clouds having internal pressure @xmath141 dyn .",
    "jones et al . ( @xcite ) showed in their numerical simulations that a `` magnetic shield '' forms around a cloud moving through a medium .",
    "the field lines of the medium are caught by a cloud , stretched and the magnetic field is amplified .",
    "the `` shield '' has magnetic pressure comparable to the ram pressure and is able to quench gas - dynamical instabilities and prevent evaporation of a cloud .",
    "energy of the `` magnetic shield '' is converted from the kinetic energy of the cloud .",
    "so , the magnetic field needed for the confinement of the clouds in the jets of ss433 can be generated by the motion of the clouds through the wind of the accretion disk .",
    "this mechanism of the confinement naturally explains the termination of the optical jet beyond the `` crushing wall '' at a distance @xmath142 , where collisional interaction of the clouds with the wind ceases .",
    "we have considered consequences of collisional interaction of clouds in the jets of ss433 with the wind of the accretion disk .",
    "this interaction appears to be a determining factor of the clouds state and evolution .",
    "this is emphasized by the fact that the clouds exist only in boundaries of the sweep - out zone over which the jet sweeps out the wind .",
    "we propose that in the sweep - out zone the clouds are prevented from destruction essentially by a magnetic field which is amplified due to a collisional interaction with the wind .",
    "the rapid expansion of the clouds after their exit from the sweep - out zone naturally explains the disappearance of the jet hydrogen line emission and the brightening of the jets at radio wavelengths .",
    "the collisional interaction of the jets of ss433 with its surroundings is possible for two reasons : the powerful wind from the supercritical accretion disk and the precession with cone opening being much larger than the jet opening angle .",
    "these factors are necessary for the existence of the cold clouds radiating the hydrogen lines",
