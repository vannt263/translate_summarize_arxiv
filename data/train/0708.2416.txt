    "the measurement of hadron spectra at high transverse momenta ( @xmath0 ) has been a powerful tool in studying the modification of particle production and propagation in the nuclear medium at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing results observed so far at rhic is the strong suppression of the yield of hadrons with  above @xmath2  in midcentral and central  collisions relative to the corresponding yield in  collisions scaled by the sum of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions in the   interaction  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which the hard scattered parton loses significant energy when it traverses the medium created during the collision  @xcite .",
    "there is additional evidence for the strong interaction of partons with the final state medium .",
    "for example , two particle azimuthal correlations demonstrate significant modifications of jets such as width and particle content  @xcite . in the  region ,",
    "2 @xmath3  @xmath3 5gev/@xmath4 , an anomalously large baryon / meson ratio is observed  @xcite .",
    "the coalescence of thermal and shower partons offers a possible explanation of this phenomenon as a final state effect  @xcite .",
    "the hadron spectrum is sensitive to final state effects including jet quenching , parton recombination and scattering of produced particles , in addition to initial state effects , such as gluon saturation and nuclear shadowing  @xcite , and the cronin effect  @xcite .",
    "if shadowing or gluon saturation are actually responsible for the large suppression seen in  collisions , these same effects would also produce a suppression of 20 - 30% in the yield of high  @xcite hadrons even in  collisions .    to study the role of initial state effects in the high  suppression ,  collisions at rhic serve as a control experiment , since no dense matter",
    "is expected to be formed in these collisions .",
    "earlier measurements on inclusive hadron production in  collisions show no suppression of high  hadrons  @xcite .",
    "rather , there is a small enhancement in the yield of high momentum particles in  collisions .",
    "this result implies that the effects seen in central  collisions are largely due to final state interactions in the dense medium .    in this paper , we extend our investigation of charged hadron production in  collisions at  = 200 gev at midrapidity with detailed centrality selections and with significantly higher statistics .",
    "the centrality selection allows one to make quantitative statements about the impact parameter dependence of particle production .",
    "the nuclear modification of high  hadron production in proton reactions with heavy nuclei has previously been studied at lower center of mass energies  @xcite .",
    "it was found that hadron yield at high  in @xmath5+@xmath6 collisions increases faster than the nuclear mass , @xmath6 .",
    "this effect , known as the cronin effect , is conventionally parametrized as @xmath7 . at @xmath810 - 30",
    "gev , @xmath9 depends on  and is found to be greater than unity for  @xmath10 2gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 also depends on the particle species ; it was found to be larger for baryons than for mesons .",
    "the cronin effect is often attributed to the multiple scattering of projectile partons propagating through the target nucleus  @xcite .",
    "a deuteron projectile has an additional interesting characteristic : since the average separation between the proton and neutron in the deuteron is large , on the order of few a fm , there is a class of events in which only one of the two nucleons participates in the collision .",
    "thus  events can be categorized into @xmath11@xmath12au or @xmath13@xmath12au collisions , when only one of the constituent nucleons interacts , and @xmath14@xmath12au , when both nucleons participate in the collision . in such events",
    "the interacting proton or neutron is not a free proton or neutron , so it is not exactly the same as a @xmath15au or @xmath16au interaction . for simplicity",
    "we will refer to the tagged samples as @xmath15au and @xmath16au and collectively @xmath17au .",
    "the selection of @xmath15au and @xmath16au collisions in the phenix experiment is done by tagging events where the incoming deuteron has a non - interacting neutron or proton .",
    "combined with centrality selection , such event tagging provides better control of the collision geometry and of the number of subsequent inelastic nucleon - nucleon interactions in the gold nucleus .",
    "very little experimental information has been published about neutron - nucleus collisions at high energy .",
    "tagging allows the direct comparison of @xmath18au , @xmath15au , and @xmath16au interactions .",
    "results from these collisions are compared with  data measured by the phenix experiment at the same beam energy to shed light on the cronin enhancement and other nuclear effects .",
    "further , we have investigated the cronin effect as a function of the number of collisions per participant nucleon in the deuteron . to estimate the fraction of pions in the charged hadron spectrum , we have looked at hadron to pion ratios as a function of transverse momentum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives a detailed account of the analysis in which we describe the detector , centrality selection , charged particle background rejection , spectra corrections and systematic errors . in sec .",
    "iii , the centrality and  dependence of the charged hadron spectra , and a comparison with the  and the  data are discussed .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "the phenix detector consists of four spectrometer arms positioned around the vertex of colliding deuteron and gold nuclei  two central arms at midrapidity and two muon arms at forward rapidities  and a set of detectors .",
    "a detailed description of the detector can be found elsewhere , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "this analysis uses the two central arms and the set of global detectors .",

    "charged particles are tracked by drift chambers ( dcs ) located 2 m from the vertex and layers of pad chambers ( pc1 and pc3 ) positioned at 2.5 and 5 m in the radial direction .",
    "the central spectrometer provides axial magnetic fields along the beam pipe .",
    "the transverse momentum ,  of each particle is determined by its deflection angle in the azimuthal direction as measured by the dc .",
    "the total particle momentum is reconstructed by projecting tracks back to the collision vertex through the magnetic field .",
    "the track reconstruction efficiency is approximately 98% and independent of  with negligible centrality dependence .",
    "the particle momenta are measured with a resolution @xmath21 , with @xmath5 in gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the absolute momentum scale is calibrated to 0.7@xmath22 from the reconstructed proton mass using the phenix time - of - flight system . at high transverse momentum ,",
    "a substantial background of electrons is produced by photon conversion in the material between the beam pipe and drift chambers . to subtract this background from photon conversion we use the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) .",
    "the rich is filled with @xmath23 gas at atmospheric pressure and has a charged particle threshold @xmath24 for emission of cherenkov photons .    to characterize the global parameters of the collision and its centrality , the phenix experiment uses beam - beam counters ( bbcs ) covering the pseudorapidity range 3.0@xmath25 3.9 , zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) and forward calorimeters ( fcals ) located at @xmath26 .",
    "the locations of these global detectors are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdc_fcal ] .",
    "each bbc is an array of 64 cherenkov counters around the beam pipe and is positioned at 1.44 m upstream or downstream of the nominal vertex location .",
    "the information from the bbc is used for the event timing , vertex position , and centrality determination .",
    "the two zdcs are hadronic calorimeters which measure spectator neutrons  @xcite .",

    "the forward calorimeters were installed before the  run .",
    "the fcal is a hadron calorimeter and consists of lead scintillating fiber modules originally used in bnl alternating gradient synchotron ( ags ) experiment e864  @xcite rearranged into two 9 by 10 arrays .",
    "the only difference from the e864 experiment is the readout electronics , which are identical to phenix central arm electromagnetic calorimeter electronics .",
    "the size of each module is 10 @xmath28 10 @xmath28 117 cm , the average tower density is 9.6 g/@xmath29 , and the total length corresponds to 60 nuclear interaction lengths .",
    "the two arrays are located 18 m from the interaction point along the beam pipes downstream of the first beam - line deflecting ( dx ) magnet .",
    "the dx magnets work as sweeping magnets for the spectator protons .",
    "the fcal measures the energy of the spectator protons .",
    "the resolution of the fcal on the north side for measuring 100 gev protons from the deuteron fragmentation was @xmath27 40 gev .",

    "we assume that the number of charged particles firing the bbcs is linearly proportional , on average , to the number of participants from the gold nucleus in the reaction . to check this ,",
    "the bbcs response was simulated as a superposition of independent @xmath34 nucleon - nucleon type reactions , where @xmath34 is the number of participating nucleons in the struck gold nucleus . as a baseline for the bbcs modeling we use unbiased data from previous rhic  runs where proton - proton inelastic collisions were selected with a trigger synchronized to fire whenever filled bunches crossed in the phenix interaction region .",

    "background may contribute to the tag sample from the left side of the spectrum with low amplitudes . to estimate the background contamination we fitted the left part of the spectrum using an exponentially falling function and fitted a gaussian function to the detector response to the spectator nucleon . the thin smooth line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tag ] shows the sum of the two functions .",
    "the background under the gaussian peak was estimated as the integral of the exponential function above our cut , which is marked by the vertical line and arrow .",

    "the goal of this analysis is to measure the charged hadron spectrum in the phenix central arms .",
    "thus , we can estimate the stability of our results measured by the central arms versus different cuts applied to the fcaln .",
    "we define the stability of the measurement , @xmath40 , in a particular fcaln bin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] ) as the ratio of the number of charged particle tracks per event with  @xmath10 0.5gev/@xmath4 for this cut to a reference cut in which the signal to background ratio is the largest . for the reference cut we use 100 @xmath33 20 gev fcaln response ( within region 3 as defined above ) .",

    "the magnitude of the cronin effect is independent of the number of additional scatterings ( @xmath1  1 ) within the limits of our uncertainties .",
    "we also studied the ratio of charged hadron yield to pion yield .",
    "we found that the charged pions account for about 60% of the charged hadrons at  @xmath103 gev/@xmath4 , with a slightly larger value in central @xmath80+au collisions .",
    "this implies that @xmath82 for protons and kaons remains close to one at higher @xmath0 .",
