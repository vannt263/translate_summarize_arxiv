    "while the milky way galaxy is the most explored galaxy , its global three  dimensional ( 3d ) structure , such as the spiral arms , has not yet been clarified , because we are embedded in it .",
    "one of the best tracers of the global structure of the galaxy is neutral hydrogen ( h i ) gas , because h i gas is one of the major components of the interstellar matter ( ism ) in spiral galaxies , and the ism is almost optically thin against the 21-cm line of the h i gas .",
    "the earliest study of the global structure of the milky way using h i data was done by @xcite , who presented a face - on h i density map of the whole galaxy .",
    "they reported several hi arms in the milky way : the so - called sagittarius arm , the orion arm , and the perseus arm . later , as more h i surveys were achieved , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite traced larger - radius h i arm , which is the so - called outer arm , on a longitude  velocity diagram .",
    "@xcite analyzed the h i data to make an h i density map for the outer galaxy , and traced two arms having a pitch angle of @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "burton and te lintel hekkert ( 1986 ) showed three ",
    "dimensional h i maps of the outer galaxy for all galactic longitudes , and reported a warped h i disk .",
    "@xcite also presented an h i density distribution of the outer galaxy , and discussed the warped disk and the flaring h i disk .",
    "more recently , hartmann and burton ( 1997 ) archived a deeper and more complete survey with a much higher sensitivity . in the present work",
    ", we tried to convert this latest data cube into an h i distribution . combining with the southern survey data cubes available",
    ", we aimed to derive a 3d map of the whole galaxy .",
    "this paper is the first of a series presenting our analysis of the 3d structure of the ism . in the second paper",
    ", we will present the result for molecular gas .    in this paper",
    "we describe the data and our method for deriving the h i distribution of the whole galaxy in sections [ data ] and [ method ] , and report on the resultant h i maps and some properties of h i disk of the galaxy in section [ result ] .",
    "three available h i survey data are used in this paper : the leiden / dwingeloo survey @xcite , parkes survey @xcite , and nrao survey @xcite , which all are archived in the fits format .",
    "we took data within a latitude range of @xmath7 from these data cubes to study the h i distribution .",
    "the leiden / dwingeloo survey @xcite is used for the northern hemisphere , which was obtained with the 25 m dwingeloo radio telescope in the netherlands with a half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of @xmath8 .",
    "the data consists of 21 cm line spectra over the entire sky above declinations of @xmath9 with a grid spacing of @xmath10 . the radial velocity ( @xmath11 ) coverage is from @xmath12 to @xmath13 km s@xmath14 with a velocity resolution of @xmath15 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "noise level is 0.07 k. these spectra are averaged so that the bin width of latitude becomes @xmath16 in this paper .",
    "the parkes survey @xcite is used for the southern hemisphere , which was obtained with the cisro 18 m telescope in australia with an hpbw of @xmath17 .",
    "it covers galactic longitudes from @xmath18 to @xmath19 with a grid spacing of @xmath20 , and galactic latitude @xmath21 to @xmath22 , with a grid spacing @xmath23 .",
    "the velocity range is 300 km s@xmath14 with a velocity resolution of @xmath24 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the average r.m.s . is 0.27 k. these spectra are also averaged so that the bin width of latitude becomes @xmath16 .",
    "the galactic center h i survey of national radio astronomy observatory is used for the southern hemisphere between @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this data cube was obtained with the 140-feet telescope of the nrao , whose hpbw is @xmath27 .",
    "the survey covers the region @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and a grid spacing of @xmath10 in both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the velocity range is @xmath32 km s@xmath14 and the velocity resolution 5.5 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "level is 0.03 k. these spectra are also averaged so that the bin width of latitude becomes @xmath16 .      since the 21-cm spectra have only information about the radial velocity of the h i gas , we need to transform the radial velocity , @xmath33 , of the ism in the galaxy into the distance , @xmath34 , in the line of sight .",
    "the relation between the radial velocity , @xmath11 , and the distance , @xmath34 , in the line of sight is obtained using the rotation curve of the galaxy , assuming that it rotates circularly .    for the inner rotation curve ,",
    "we use clemens s rotation curve @xcite , which was derived from the massachusetts ",
    "stoney brook galactic equator co survey .",
    "clemens s rotation curve was fitted by a polynomial of the form    @xmath35    though clemens listed the fitted coefficients , @xmath36 , for the cases of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we modified them for the case of @xmath39 in order to connect smoothly to the outer rotation curve in this paper",
    ". modified coefficients are listed in table [ coefficient ] .",
    ".modified coefficients of the inner rotation curve . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the outer rotation curve , we use a model rotation curve of @xcite , which was determined by fitting to observational constraints ever obtained .",
    "however , because of the small number of data points for the outer rotation curve , the mass model has not been settled yet , and four types of models are presented by @xcite . of the four models , model 2 is adopted in this work , since it has the smallest deviation from the observation among the four . in using this rotation curve",
    ", we adopted @xmath40 kpc , @xmath41 km",
    "s@xmath14 , which are used for the galactic constant in @xcite . the shape of the whole rotation curve used in this paper is shown in figure 1 .",
    "in this section we describe a method for transforming the 21-cm spectra into an h i density distribution . due to a geometrical reason ,",
    "the h i distribution should be calculated separately in several cases : the outer galaxy , the inner galaxy , and near the tangential points .",
    "the radial velocity and the distance in a line of sight can be uniquely determined in the outer galaxy , but the distance can not be determined uniquely from the radial velocity in the inner galaxy because of the near - far ambiguity . since the h i gas has a velocity dispersion , the h i density at the tangential point can not be calculated without considering its effects .",
    "the distance of the h i gas having a radial velocity @xmath11 can be calculated as follows .",
    "assuming that the motion of the galactic ism is purely circular and that the gas away from the galactic plane rotates at the same speed as the gas in the underlying disk , the radial velocity @xmath11 of the ism at galactic longitude @xmath30 , galactic latitude @xmath31 , and galactocentric distance @xmath42 is expressed by    @xmath43 \\sin{l } \\cos{b}.\\ ] ]    the heliocentric distance @xmath34 of the ism at @xmath44 is obtained by solving the equation @xmath45 in the outer part of the solar orbit ( @xmath46 ) , we have one solution , @xmath47 , because the other solution has a negative value , which is inadequate .    in the inner galaxy ( @xmath48 )",
    "we have two adequate solutions , @xmath49 ; that is , we have the two - fold of kinematic distance in the inner galaxy .",
    "however , at a tangential point where @xmath50 , equation ( [ costheory ] ) has only one solution despite the inner galaxy .",
    "hence , we have no ambiguity of distance at this point , and the kinematic distance is uniquely determined for a given radial velocity .",
    "for example , we plot the radial velocity against the heliocentric distance ( @xmath34 ) in the case of @xmath51 in figure 2 .",
    "the radial velocity in the longitude range @xmath52 becomes positive in the inner galaxy , and increases toward the tangential point where it gets maximum . beyond the tangential point it decreases monotonically and becomes negative in the outer galaxy .",
    "the radial velocity for the whole galactic equator is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "the h i density can be estimated as follows .",
    "if the 21-cm line is assumed to be optically thin , the h i column density @xmath53 [ @xmath54 is given by integrating brightness temperature , @xmath55 [ k ] , over radial velocity , @xmath11 [ km s@xmath14 ] , @xmath57 } = 1.82 \\times 10^{18 }   \\int^{v_{{\\rm r}1}+ \\delta v_{\\rm r}}_{v_{{\\rm r}1 } } t_{\\rm b } dv_{\\rm r}.\\ ] ] in this work , the velocity width , @xmath58 , is taken to be @xmath59 km s@xmath14 in the case of the leiden / dwingeloo survey , @xmath60 km s@xmath14 in the case of the parkes survey , and 5.5 km s@xmath14 in the case of the nrao survey based on the velocity resolution of the southern survey .",
    "the average volume density at an individual point is given by dividing the column density by the path length , @xmath61 , which contributes emission in the velocity range @xmath62 : @xmath63 = { n_{\\rm hi } \\over \\delta r } = 1.82 \\times 10^{18 } t_{\\rm b } { \\delta v_{\\rm r } \\over \\delta r}.\\ ] ]    thus , we obtain the h i densities , @xmath64 , in the outer galaxy from the 21-cm spectra @xmath65",
    ". however , the local gas with a high velocity dispersion contributes to the high - altitude emissions .",
    "therefore , the obtained h i distribution includes the local gas in the form of @xmath66 . in this paper",
    ", we assumed that the local gas can be expressed by a linear function of the galactic latitude , @xmath31 , and subtracted it from @xmath67 .",
    "because of this procedure , the diffuse h i gas , which extends to a high galactic altitude @xcite , is subtracted , and can not be detected in the maps presented in this paper .      at a tangential point",
    "@xmath68 the kinematic distance can be uniquely determined even for the inner galaxy .",
    "since the h i gas has an intrinsic velocity dispersion , the h i spectra have a higher velocity component than the terminal velocity , @xmath69 . velocity dispersion , @xmath70 ,",
    "is assumed to be 10 km s@xmath14 ; @xcite estimate it to be @xmath71 km s@xmath14 for the first quadrant ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 km s@xmath14 for the fourth quadrant ( @xmath74 ) . in a given line of sight , the h i gas having a radial velocity of the range @xmath75 contributes to a higher velocity component than the terminal velocity due the velocity dispersion .",
    "also , equation ( [ tbtonhi ] ) at the tangential points does not work because @xmath76 goes to zero there .",
    "therefore , the volume density of the h i gas giving the radial velocity @xmath75 around the tangential points is calculated by integrating the emission within the velocity range of @xmath77 , as follows : @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the heliocentric distances of the points giving radial velocities of @xmath82 .",
    "subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the near and far points , respectively .      in the inner galaxy",
    "there are two points giving the same radial velocity in a given line of sight , and thus the observed spectra give the total emission at the near and far points .",
    "we solved this problem of the distance - degeneracy by considering the h i layer thickness .",
    "first of all , we determined the h i layer thickness and its variations using the galactocentric distance .",
    "for the model of the vertical distribution of h i we use spitzer s model @xcite .",
    "@xcite analytically solved the dynamical @xmath83-distribution of stars and ism . assuming that the stars and gas in the galactic disk are isothermal and self - gravitating",
    ", the number density @xmath64 can be expressed as a function of @xmath83 by solving poisson s equation in hydro - dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we then obtain @xmath84 with @xmath85 being @xmath86 where @xmath83 is the height from the galactic equator , @xmath87 is the height where @xmath88 becomes the maximum value , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the height where @xmath64 becomes half the value of the maximum , which is half the full width of the half maximum ( fwhm ) .    in equation ( [ spi_eq ] )",
    "we assume that @xmath89 and @xmath87 vary with its position , but the scale - height , @xmath90 , depends on the galactocentric distance alone .",
    "we determined the h i layer thickness @xmath90 as a function of the galactocentric distance by fitting the model function to the observed data .",
    "the thickness of the inner h i layer was determined by fitting the model function to the vertical distribution at the tangential point obtained in the previous section ; we substituted the values into three parameters , ( @xmath89 , @xmath87 , and @xmath90 ) in equation ( [ spi_eq ] ) , and chose the best set of parameters to fit to the observation by the least - squares method .",
    "the steps to search for the parameters were @xmath91 of the peak for @xmath89 , 1 pc for @xmath87 and @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand , the thickness of the outer disk was determined by fitting the model to all points , since there is no distance - ambiguity in the outer galaxy .",
    "the resultant thickness of the h i layer is presented in figure 4 .",
    "for the next stage , the total emission was divided into two h i densities at the near and far points in the line of sight using the thickness of the h i layer .",
    "first , consider an h i gas having a radial velocity @xmath92 for a given longitude , @xmath30 .",
    "this gas locates at corresponding kinematic distances , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . assuming that the h i gas follows spitzer s model , the h i column density , @xmath95 , is represented as a function of latitude with four parameters : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "that is , @xmath100 where @xmath101    @xmath102    the four parameters were determined by fitting the observed data by a model using the least - squares method .",
    "finally , the h i density at the near and far points were calculated using @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "we thus obtain an h i density cube , @xmath105 , from the 21-cm spectra @xmath106 .",
    "finally , the @xmath64 data cube in the @xmath107 space was transformed into @xmath64 in @xmath108 space where @xmath109 are the cartesian coordinates in the galaxy .",
    "the position @xmath110 indicates the galactic center ( g.c . ) , and the sun is situated at @xmath111 .",
    "the space of @xmath107 was also transformed into cylindrical coordinates @xmath112 , where @xmath42 and @xmath113 are the distance from the rotation axis and the azimuth angle around it , respectively .",
    "the angle @xmath113 was taken so that @xmath114 points to the sun and @xmath115 is parallel to @xmath116 .",
    "the derived h i density distribution is presented in the forms of ( 1 ) a face - on h i column density map , ( 2 ) face - on hi volume density maps sliced at several altitudes , and ( 3 ) edge - on h i volume density maps sliced at several azimuthal angles around the galactic center .",
    "_ face - on column density map_ figure 5 shows a face - on column density map of h i gas in the galaxy . according to the @xcite s model , the h i column density , @xmath117 ,",

    "some h i spiral arms can be traced in the resultant face - on maps , figure 5 and figure 6 . in order to investigate the properties of the spiral arms , the h i column density",
    "is shown in polar coordinates in figure 8 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axes represent the azimuthal angle @xmath113 and the distance @xmath42 from the galactic center in logarithmic scale , respectively .",
    "each arm on the polar diagram is found to be aligned in a straight line , indicating that the arms are logarithmic spiral arms .",
    "schematic tracers of h i arms are presented in figure 9 .",
    "the largest arm is the so - called outer arm which is traced from @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "the pitch angle is estimated to be @xmath134 .",
    "another prominent arm is traced from @xmath135 to @xmath136 , which is the so - called sagittarius ",
    "carina arm .",
    "its pitch angle is also estimated to be @xmath137 .",
    "another arm can be traced from @xmath138 to @xmath139 , which corresponds to the so - called perseus arm .",
    "the pitch angle is @xmath140 .",
    "this arm may apparently connect to the outer arm ( figure 5 ) , but has a clearly different pitch angle .",
    "hence , they may be distinct arms .    the sun is located at a relatively h i - rich region between the sagittarius ",
    "carina arm and perseus arm , which is called the local arm .",
    "the galactic spiral structure has been studied by many researchers using various methods .",
    "@xcite found three h i spiral arms : the sagittarius , orion , and perseus arms .",
    "although the orion arm may correspond to the local arm , the others are in good agreement with our traced arms .",
    "@xcite found the outer arm , which also agrees with our result .",
    "they estimated the pitch angle of the sagittarius ",
    "carina arm to be @xmath141 , which is consistent with our result .",
    "@xcite reported three spiral arms , and estimated the pitch angles to be @xmath142 ",
    "@xmath6 , which are pretty large compared to our values .",
    "@xcite presented four spiral arms using the hii regions .",
    "they traced the sagittarius ",
    "carina arm with a pitch angle @xmath143  @xmath144 , and the perseus arm with s pitch angle of @xmath0 , which are consistent with our results .",
    "however , their scutum  crux and norma arms could not be confirmed in our h i map .",
    "@xcite fitted the far and near infrared data form cobe / dirbe by a 2- and 4-armed logarithmic spiral model .",
    "our sagittarius and perseus arms are consistent with their spiral structure .",
    "also , our result that the galactic arms are logarithmic spiral arms confirms their logarithmic spiral model .      the radial distribution of the surface density of the h i gas is shown in figure 10 by averaging it azimuthally .",
    "the surface density is low near the galactic center , and is lower than 1.9 @xmath145 within a radius of 6 kpc .",
    "the h i surface density attains the maximum values at radii 7  12 kpc , where it becomes larger than 4 @xmath146 .",
    "then , the h i density decreases toward the outer region .",
    "it amounts to @xmath147 @xmath148 at radius 17 kpc , and therefore the size of the h i disk is 17 kpc according to the definition of @xcite .",
    "this radius of the h i disk is about 1.3times as large as the stellar disk , since the stellar disk is estimated to be 13 kpc assuming @xmath149 kpc @xcite .",
    "this ratio is typical for general spiral galaxies .",
    "the h i mass within a radius of 17 kpc was calculated to be @xmath150 @xmath151 , which corresponds to 1.5% of the total mass predicted by the rotation curve .",
    "figure 7 shows that the h i disk is strongly warping at the outer region , which is consistent with former studies @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of warping is large in the directions @xmath152 and @xmath153 . in the direction @xmath152",
    ", warping starts near @xmath154 kpc , and the h i disk is bending up to @xmath155 kpc height from the galactic plane at @xmath156 kpc . also , in the direction of @xmath153 , warping also starts at @xmath157 kpc .",
    "then , the h i disk is bending down to @xmath158 kpc height from the galactic plane at @xmath156 kpc , and is flopping back to @xmath159 kpc height at @xmath160 kpc .",
    "thus , the galactic warping is found to be asymmetric .",
    "since the size of the stellar disk is thought to be about 13 kpc , the warping starts at the edge of the stellar disk , which follows one of the rules of warping @xcite .",
    "hence , the warping is asymmetric .",
    "this work displays the tilting of the inner disk @xcite . in figure 11 ,",
    "the centroid of the h i disk @xmath87 at @xmath161 kpc is plotted versus azimuthal angle @xmath113 for an instance , which shows that the h i disk is tilted against the @xmath162 plane .",
    "the amplitude of the tilting is @xmath163 pc .",
    "the h i disk is bending up in the direction @xmath164 , and is bending down in the direction @xmath165 , which is the same trend as the warping of the outer disk .",
    "figure 5 shows that the galactic h i disk is not symmetric .",
    "the h i disk is swelled in the direction @xmath166 in the third quadrant .",
    "the radius of the outer h i disk ( defined by the contours at @xmath167 h @xmath168 in the second quadrant ) is @xmath169 kpc , whereas it is @xmath170 kpc in the fourth quadrant .",
    "hence , the galaxy is significantly lopsided in h i.      we define the scale - height of the h i disk as the value of @xmath90 ( see subsection [ inner ] ) . the azimuthally averaged scale - height is plotted in figure 4 versus the radius .",
    "figure 4 shows that the scale - height increases with radius , from @xmath163 pc at @xmath171 kpc to @xmath172 pc at @xmath173 kpc .",
    "according to the @xcite s model , the scale - height is calculated as @xmath174{{2 \\sigma^2 \\over 3 \\pi g \\rho}}.\\ ] ] assuming that velocity dispersion is constant at any radius , the increase in the scale - height implies a decrease in the surface mass density at the galactic plane .    in subsection",
    "[ outer ] , the volume density of h i gas ( @xmath175 ) and scale - height ( @xmath90 ) are obtained for each point of the outer galaxy . in figure 12 , we plot the scale - height , @xmath90 , versus h i volume density , @xmath175 , in an annulus of a constant radius of @xmath176 kpc .",
    "figure 12 shows that there is a negative correlation between the h i volume density , @xmath89 , and the scale - height , @xmath90 , which were determined independently of each other in our analysis .",
    "the h i volume density is approximately expressed by @xmath177 by a least - squares fitting .      in this work ,",
    "resultant maps were obtained based on some assumptions , which might potentially cause systematic errors in our results .",
    "possible systematic problems are described below .",
    "_ pure circular rotation_ though the distances of h i clouds were calculated based on an assumption that the galaxy rotates in pure circular rotation , @xcite mentioned that the streaming motion predicted by the density wave theory is not negligible .",
    "however , because we are interested in the global distribution of the h i gas , the effects due to the streaming motion were not taken into account . since the streaming amplitudes were estimated to be between 3 and 8 km s@xmath14 , the typical errors in the calculated distances of h i clouds were on the order of 1 kpc .",
    "particularly , in the central region , the non - circular motion may be large , because the galaxy is believed to have a bar whose size is estimated to be about 3 kpc .",
    "hence , the h i distribution in the central 3 kpc may be incredible .",
    "_ dependence on rotation curves_ our resultant h i map is dependent on the rotation curves and there occur two possible systematic errors .",
    "first is the h i disk size .",
    "if the rotation velocity becomes larger values than the one we used , the h i disk will be stretched outwards .",
    "second is the h i contrast .",
    "if a rotation curve has multiple peaks such as those found in rotation curves of @xcite , h i is concentrated in rings at corresponding radii , because the h i density depends on @xmath178 in equation ( [ tbtonhi ] ) .",
    "we used a smooth rotation curve in order to avoid such artificial rings .",
    "_ cylindrical rotation_ we assumed that the gas away from the galactic plane rotates at the same speed as the gas in the underlying disk .",
    "this assumption was often used in former studies @xcite . however",
    ", this assumption may not be adopted for the high - altitude h i gas , because it is known that the rotation velocity at a large distance from the galactic plane becomes slower than that of the gas at underlying disk @xcite based on observations of an external edge - on galaxy , such as ngc 891 in h i line .",
    "_ fitting method_ we determined the h i distribution in the inner galaxy by a fitting method , as mentioned in subsection [ inner ] .",
    "however , this fitting method can not always work precisely . largely deviated h i clouds from the surrounding gas , often seen in resultant maps , are thus doubtful , while a global feature is plausible .",
    "_ dependence of adopted functions for @xmath83-distribution_ while the function @xmath179 was adopted in our analysis , the real gas distribution can not be perfectly represented by it , because the gas is not isothermal @xcite .",
    "we present h i column density maps derived by using other functions , such as a gaussian function and exponential function in figure 12 .",
    "though the resultant maps depend on the adopted functions , the global structure is not strongly affected by the difference of the chosen functions , but the resultant densities varies by a factor of @xmath180 inside the solar circle .",
    "we obtained a three - dimensional h i distribution in the milky way galaxy using the leiden ",
    "dwingeloo h i survey @xcite , parkes survey @xcite , and the nrao survey @xcite by combining with @xcite and @xcite s rotation curves .",
