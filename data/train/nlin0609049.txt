    "two main classes of control strategies are established in chaos control : the ogy control algorithm  @xcite , almost a standard method for controlling chaos , does not provide any readjustment of the fixed point during in - situ measurements without loss of control . in many experimental systems , however , it is desirable to use a control strategy that does not rely on the knowledge of the exact position of the fixed point , because the location of the fixed points can change due to drifts in parameters . on the other hand , the time - continuous control method proposed by pyragas  @xcite",
    "is practically limited by the required sampling rate , and does not allow stabilization of arbitrary orbits as has recently been shown in  @xcite .",
    "both problems are circumvented by simple time - discrete difference control  @xcite .",
    "it is limited to a certain range of ljapunov numbers .",
    "control of arbitrary periodic orbits can be achieved if the algorithm is applied only every second period  @xcite or by a memory method .    in this paper",
    "we present an improved memory difference control ( mdc ) method that takes control amplitudes into account that were applied at previous time steps .",
    "mdc allows one to stabilize drifting fixed points with arbitrary ljapunov numbers and shows an enlarged region of stability .",
    "this method is generalized when dealing with measurements delayed by @xmath0 time steps ( orbit periods ) .",
    "this task is accomplished by increasing the number of memorized control amplitudes by  @xmath0 .",
    "given the stable and unstable directions of the fixed point with sufficient accuracy , only one accessible control parameter for each unstable direction is required to achieve control .",
    "we compare difference control and mdc at the well - known chua oscillator  @xcite and show that orbits for which difference control fails are stabilized by mdc .",
    "in experimental situations a poincar section is commonly used to reduce the dynamics to a time - discrete description by an iterated map @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes a set of control parameters that are in the unperturbed dynamics assumed to be constant or varying on a slow time scale compared to the the length of a period orbit .    the idea to control chaos by small perturbations of control parameters implies that @xmath2 becomes time - dependent .",
    "the time - dependent control parameter @xmath3 is updated at each discrete time step defined by the poincar section .",
    "its value is determined according to the specific control algorithm and is kept constant for a part of the orbit . without loss of generality",
    "we choose @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the fixed point to be stabilized .",
    "the linearized equation of motion around the unstable fixed point then becomes @xmath6 where @xmath7 the ljapunov numbers of the orbit are the eigenvalues of @xmath8 .",
    "here one has to distinguish the ljapunov number of an orbit ( or time - discrete map ) from the local ( or conditional ) ljapunov exponent and the commonly used global ljapunov exponent being an ergodic average over the attractor  @xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible to proceed with a multiparameter control by using as many control parameters as there are degrees of freedom , i.  e. @xmath9 .",
    "instead , it is common to follow ott , grebogi and yorke  @xcite to transform the system to the eigensystem of @xmath8 .",
    "control is applied _ only _ in the unstable subspace  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the equation of motion is again of the form of eq .",
    "( [ dynamik_1dim ] ) with reduced dimension of @xmath8 .    in difference control",
    "@xcite the control parameter is updated at the poincar section according to @xmath10 in contrast to ogy control , difference control is limited to fixed points with ljapunov numbers between @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a stability diagram @xcite for the case of one unstable eigenvalue is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cdcstab ] .",
    "simple difference control uses information that is partially out of date , resulting in an additional degree of freedom from the delayed amplitude @xmath13 .",
    "this fact is illustrated by imagining two agents controlling the same system in turns .",
    "if they do not communicate , control fails because of the inherent delay of the system to be controlled .",
    "this effect is compensated when using the information contained in the previous value of the control amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "we define memory difference control by  @xcite @xmath15 combined with ( [ dynamik_1dim ] ) , we obtain a dynamical system which reads in delayed coordinates for @xmath16 and @xmath2 @xmath17 in order to stabilize the fixed point all eigenvalues @xmath18 of the matrix in ( [ eq : mdcdynamik ] ) must have a modulus smaller than one .",
    "this ensures exponential convergence to the fixed point .",
    "if all parameter values are chosen such that all eigenvalues become zero , the fixed point is reached after a finite number of time steps .",
    "in fact this can be guaranteed by mdc .",
    "we first assume that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are both invertible , and that the number of accessible control parameters is equal to or greater than the dimension of the unstable manifold , i.  e. @xmath21",
    ". then all eigenvalues are zero @xcite if @xmath22    the concept of mdc can be generalized to stabilization of ( known and unknown ) fixed points when @xmath16 can be measured only after a finite number of delay steps@xcite : if the system is measured with @xmath0 steps delay , ( [ eq : verbdiffkont ] ) is replaced by @xmath23 where the feedback now contains a sum over @xmath24 preceding control amplitudes : + @xmath25 a similar control scheme can be applied for ogy control by choosing @xmath26 and @xmath27 , . for details see @xcite .",
    "since the optimal control values are never exactly matched in experiments , it is important to know the complete stability diagram in @xmath28 , in particular the optimal value of @xmath29 for given @xmath30 and vice versa . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the characteristic equation is given by @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the stability region in the @xmath28-plane , i.e. where all eigenvalues have modulus smaller than one , is the triangle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffkontrdreieck ] .",
    "its corners are given by @xmath32 where the eigenvalues take the values @xmath33 and @xmath12 as indicated by the indices .",
    "two sides of the triangle are determined by the conditions that one eigenvalue is equal to @xmath33 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the third is given by @xmath34 where the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair on the unit circle .",
    "the line that determines that @xmath30 with minimal eigenvalues for a given @xmath29 ( and vice versa ) is given by the algebraic expression @xmath35 where both eigenvalues coincide .",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency of the improved difference method by controlling unstable periodic orbits of the chaotic attractor of chua s oscillator @xcite .",
    "the chua circuit is an autonomous system .",
    "the poincar section necessary for control is obtained by an electronic zero - crossing - detector .",
    "the frequency is in the range of @xmath36 and allows the usage of digital signal processing tools to implement control algorithms .",
    "parameter drifts , e.g.  temperature drifts , naturally occur in electronic circuits and difference control methods have the advantage that they follow the drifting fixed point . in order to get access to an appropriate control parameter , a vcr ( voltage controlled resistor ) has been added to the circuit .",
    "the basic dynamics is nevertheless determined by the resistor @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore the chua circuit allows to investigate interesting ranges of ljapunov numbers simply by choosing different values of the main control parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the dynamics of the chua circuit is described , in first approximation , by the normalized equations @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the input - output function of the negative resistance approximately described by the piecewise linear descending function @xmath40 with @xmath41 @xcite . rather than solving these equations numerically ,",
    "we demonstrate the stabilization of an unstable periodic orbit directly in the electronic system .",
    "the standard control strategy is to measure the required system variables , generate the poincar map for e.  g. three adjacent values of the control parameter ( fig .",
    "[ poincarefit ] ) , and to calculate the parameters of the feedback to the control parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme.eps ] ) .    in the present case",
    "the return map @xmath42 is approximately a function of @xmath43 alone .",
    "therefore only two variables are required .",
    "the first one , @xmath44 , is used to determine the poincar surface of section by a zero crossing detector .",
    "the second one , @xmath43 , is used for the calculation of the control .",
    "the stability region for different values of the memory term @xmath30 and feedback gain @xmath29 is measured by changing the values until control is entirely lost .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath29 is easily recognized by a doubling of the stabilized period . however , the upper bound of @xmath29 , where the loss of control is noise - induced , is more difficult to estimate . in fig .",
    "[ knp1sc ] the stability region for a stabilized orbit in the single  scroll chaos is shown .",
    "the corresponding ljapunov number @xmath45 has been calculated from the poincar map .",
    "the stability diagram includes the stability region of simple difference control as the special case @xmath46 .",
    "stabilization of the same periodic orbit in the double  scroll chaotic attractor is not possible with simple difference control .",
    "this is due to a ljapunov number of @xmath47 for which the method is predicted to fail .",
    "the stability region of the stabilized orbit in the single - scroll ( fig .",
    "[ knp1sc ] ) and double - scroll attractor ( fig .",
    "[ knp1dc ] ) have a broad overlap .",
    "thus it is possible to choose universal values of @xmath28 that allow tracking of an orbit from one regime to the other without changing parameters of the controlling circuit .",
    "the significant improvement of memory difference control compared to simple difference control is demonstrated by the estimation of ljapunov exponents ( contraction rates ) from the transient .",
    "8 shows the stability regimes for different feedback gains @xmath29 .",
    "simple difference control corresponds to @xmath48 , and mdc to @xmath49 .",
    "the range of controllability is broadened and the ljapunov exponents are smaller , equivalent to faster convergence .",
    "the measurements are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffkontrljaptheo ] ) . due to noise - induced loss of control",
    ", it was impossible to obtain reliable measurements for large @xmath29 of the case @xmath49 .",
    "from the borders and corners of the measured stability region the exact values of the ljapunov number of the controlled cycle are re - estimated , similar to the approach used in @xcite for ogy control of the hnon map .",
    "since two values of @xmath30 are exactly one , four of the six coordinate values can be used to determine @xmath8 and @xmath19 by a least - square fit weighted by the variances of the measured values giving @xmath50 for the orbit stabilized in the single scroll ( ss ) and double scroll ( ds ) attractor , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the values given in section  [ chuacontrolsection ] which were obtained from the poincar map ( fig .",
    "[ poincarefit ] ) .",
    "the dynamical behavior and stability conditions of difference control and memory difference control are fundamentally different from the stability conditions  @xcite of time - continuous pyragas control  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we introduced and discussed memory difference control as a powerful method to stabilize unstable fixed points even in the presence of parameter drift or delayed measurement .",

    "note that the unstable subspace needs only as many dimensions as the system has unstable eigenvalues .",
    "in the simplest case , the ljapunov exponents are of signature @xmath51 and the unstable subspace of dimension  1",
    ".    one could think of extending difference control by using delayed differences @xmath52 of the system variable instead of previous control values @xmath53 .",
    "this is an approach that improves ogy - fashioned control if the system is measured with _ only one step _ delay  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for difference control one does not obtain a stable control scheme from this approach .",
