    "<S> the essential procedure in this approach is the so - called _ addition of eigenvalues ( shifting parameters ) _ method that one may consider as a variant of the negative factorization energy case in the witten susy scheme as we showed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> jauslin showed that the supersymmetric master evolution can be put into the following iterative form    @xmath0 this iterative procedure is based on the initial ( @xmath1 ) master  hamiltonian \" operator which for homogeneous random walks ( jump rates not depending on site ) is @xcite @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the forward and the backward jump rates , respectively .    already at the second step ( @xmath5 ) jauslin s method generates bistability in the stationary probability ( @xmath6 ) if the second eigenvalue is chosen to be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the first one as shown in @xcite for the case of free random walks ( @xmath7 ) and confirmed by us @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multistability can be produced by adding more eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> this is of course an interesting way of generating bistability and multistability in a master equation .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we want to report on generating bistability in jauslin s scheme with the two eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 chosen to be equal . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that this is possible for asymmetric ( or driven ) one - step discrete random walks , e.g. , possessing jump rates of the type @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 a bias parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to see what happens if we keep the eigenvalues equal ( no bistability ) but change the other control parameter of the problem which is the degree of asymmetry ( or the bias ) @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found a nice build - up of bistability with increasing @xmath12 ( see the figure ) for the stationary state @xmath13    </S>",

    "<S> .    a possible application may be to the one - dimensional hopping propagation of charge carriers , such as in ( quasi ) one - dimensional polymer chains , in the presence of a bias field . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the asymmetry parameter and the electric field is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the bias field , @xmath28 is the lattice constant , and @xmath29 is the thermodynamic temperature . </S>",
    "<S> one concludes that bistability can show up either in strong fields or at low temperatures . </S>"
