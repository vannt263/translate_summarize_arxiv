    "these numbers arose in the study of morsifications in singularity theory by arnold @xcite , who also proved some surprising arithmetic properties for them .",
    "many variants of these numbers have been studied extensively by carlitz and carlitz - scoville ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the numbers @xmath2 for arbitrary @xmath13 can be regarded as a natural generalisation of the numbers @xmath21 , but are altogether less well - understood .",
    "they have been studied in various combinatorial contexts @xcite , and are related , for example , to the dimensions of irreducible representations of the symmetric group via the littlewood - richardson rule for the multiplication of schur functors @xcite",
    ".    now consider @xmath15 independent and identically distributed random variables @xmath25 , where the @xmath26 are taken from a continuous distribution ( _ i.e. _ , if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 ) .",
    "then the quantity @xmath29 is the probability that the random curve @xmath25 has up - down signature @xmath13 .",
    "thus another motivation for considering the numbers @xmath2 is because of the importance of one - dimensional random energy landscapes in statistical physics .",

    "this gives a concise description of the up - down distribution as the superposition of a small number of much simpler distributions , and gives an expression for each up - down number @xmath2 as an explicit linear combination of tangent ( or bernoulli ) numbers .",
    "we also show that the polynomial @xmath7 is in fact an exponential with respect to a certain modified product denoted @xmath33 ( proposition @xmath34 . ) from this , we can deduce some remarkable congruence properties satisfied by the set of numbers @xmath2 ( corollary @xmath35 ) .",
    "this sheds light on the fine structure of the distribution @xmath2 .",
    "the second approach is to show how one can approximate the up - down distribution @xmath30 ( and hence @xmath2 ) by considering it as a function of the lengths of its increasing or decreasing runs .",
    "we derive a simple upper - bound for the quantities @xmath30 ( theorem @xmath36 ) , which gives the asymptotic behaviour of the up - down distribution in the tail @xmath37 .",
    "this sheds light on the coarse structure of the distribution @xmath30 . in applications where the up - down numbers are used as a test for randomness ,",
    "this is useful for establishing the non - randomness of a given data set .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in @xmath38 we state our main results .",
    "in @xmath39 we recall some well - known properties of the up - down numbers , and in @xmath40 we give all the proofs of our results .",
    "the second author wishes to thank b. derrida for some interesting discussions and suggestions .",

    "any function @xmath42 on @xmath43 can be expressed as a polynomial in @xmath8 variables @xmath44 , where @xmath45 takes values in @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath47 for all @xmath48 , it follows that @xmath42 can be written as a sum of linear monomials .",
    "for example , any @xmath49-valued function on the set @xmath50 can be uniquely written in the form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",

    "by @xmath54 , the function interpolating @xmath30 is given by : @xmath55 the first few polynomials @xmath56 are listed below , and can be used to reproduce all the entries in table @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 we will show that the polynomials @xmath59 ( and hence @xmath60 ) can be obtained by truncating a certain universal polynomial @xmath7 in an infinite number of variables @xmath61      in order to consider all up - down sequences simultaneously , let @xmath62 denote the set of all up - down sequences of arbitrary finite length followed by zeros : @xmath63 let @xmath64 / i_n\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the ideal generated by the relations @xmath66 .",

    "equivalently , we can write the universal polynomial in terms of @xmath112-series : @xmath113    [ thmphi ] the universal polynomial describes the up - down sequences of length @xmath8 for all @xmath10 : @xmath114    therefore , if @xmath0 is any signature of length @xmath8 , with @xmath115 , then @xmath116    consider the case @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding up - down sequence is a function on the 256 possible up - down signatures of length eight ( see fig . 1 in the introduction ) .",

    "one can ask in general how many such @xmath112 s occur in @xmath59 .",
    "we thank the referee for pointing out that this is given asymptotically by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the real root of @xmath127 ( @xcite , sequence a023434 ) .",
    "this is still exponential , but is considerably slower than @xmath128 .",
    "the universal polynomial can be succinctly rewritten as follows .",
    "let @xmath129 denote the @xmath49-vector space which is generated by formal sums of the linear monomials @xmath130 as remarked earlier , @xmath129 is isomorphic to the vector space underlying @xmath131 @xmath132 .",
    "we now define a new product @xmath133 , which is defined on monomials by the formula @xmath134 and extends in the obvious way to all series in @xmath129 .",
    "the product @xmath33 makes @xmath129 into a commutative algebra with unit @xmath57 .",
    "we have , for example , @xmath135 but @xmath136 .",
    "we define the exponential map @xmath137 with respect to the product @xmath33 by the formula : @xmath138    [ propphiisexp ] the universal polynomial @xmath7 is an exponential : @xmath139    let @xmath140 such that @xmath141 for all @xmath142 . it is a simple exercise to show that @xmath143 if we apply this argument to the sum of the infinite series of monomials @xmath144 , @xmath145 ,  , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and so on ( recall that @xmath98 ) , we deduce that @xmath148 which proves identity @xmath149 , as required .",
    "the universal polynomial can be used to deduce a number of surprising congruence properties which are satisfied by the entire up - down sequence of length @xmath8 , for a fixed @xmath8 .",
    "we give two of the most elegant such congruences .",
    "[ cor ] let @xmath150 be any odd prime .",

    "the proof of these identities , given in @xmath158 , will follow from the formula @xmath149 using well - known congruence properties of bernoulli numbers due to kummer and clausen - von staudt @xcite .",
    "many more congruence properties can be derived from @xmath7 as follows .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath117 , we can reduce @xmath159 modulo @xmath160 and @xmath161 to give the simple relations : @xmath162 this implies that @xmath163 for all signatures @xmath164 of length @xmath121 .",

    "let @xmath167 denote the signature with an island of @xmath168 pluses , followed by an island of @xmath169 minuses , and so on , where @xmath170 is a composition of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , @xmath171 corresponds to @xmath172 .",
    "one approach to finding approximations to @xmath2 is the near separability of the function @xmath173 at maxima or minima .",
    "in other words , probabilistic considerations suggest the approximation : @xmath174 for @xmath175 . applying @xmath176 repeatedly in the case where @xmath177",
    ", we obtain @xmath178 the right - hand side can be written explicitly in closed form by @xmath179 .",

    "[ thmapprox ] for all @xmath180 , @xmath181    by @xmath54 , we can multiply through by @xmath182 to obtain a similar upper bound for @xmath183 .",

    "if the number of islands @xmath185 is very small , or if there is a very large island @xmath186 , then certainly the right hand side of @xmath187 , and therefore @xmath188 itself , will be small .",
    "this is relevant when using @xmath173 as a test for randomness .",
    "however , the converse is far from true , and the question of when @xmath188 is small is considerably more subtle .",
    "note that the denominators @xmath189 in equation @xmath187 take into account not just the island sizes @xmath186 but also first - order dependencies between adjacent islands .",
    "one can speculate that @xmath187 is something like the dominant term of an asymptotic formula expressing @xmath190 in terms of the island sizes @xmath186 .",
    "equation @xmath187 is most accurate when @xmath191 .",
    "one can obtain a complementary upper bound for any signatures @xmath192 and @xmath193 : @xmath194 this inequality follows immediately from equation @xmath195 . in @xcite ,",
    "the up - down probabilities @xmath30 were used as a test for randomness and applied to genetic microarray data .",
    "by combining the inequalities @xmath196 and @xmath187 , one could easily show by hand that many such gene expression curves were non - random .",
    "we recall two well - known recurrence relations satisfied by the up - down numbers .",
    "the first is linear , the second is quadratic .",

    "the largest element , @xmath15 , must occur at the end of a sequence of pluses .",
    "if we remove it , we obtain a permutation of length @xmath8 with signature @xmath205 or @xmath206 .",
    "it follows that there is a one to one correspondence between the set of all permutations with signature @xmath198 and the union of all permutations with signatures @xmath207 ,  , @xmath208 , which proves @xmath203 .",
    "although there is no simple formula for @xmath209 when @xmath210 , one can show ( using the previous recurrence relation , for example ) that @xmath211 using the fact that @xmath212 , for all signatures @xmath13 of length @xmath8 , we deduce that @xmath213      the second recurrence relation we will require is most simply written in terms of @xmath173 .",
