    "quantum information processing  @xcite offers potential improvements in a variety of applications .",
    "computational advantages  @xcite of quantum computers with many qubits have received the most attention but are difficult to implement physically . on the other hand , technology for manipulating and communicating",
    "just a few qubits could be sufficient to create new economic mechanisms by altering the information security and strategic incentives of the underlying game .",
    "examples of quantum mechanisms include the prisoner s dilemma  @xcite , coordination  @xcite and public goods provisioning  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a quantum mechanism can significantly reduce the free - rider problem without a third - party enforcer or repeated interactions , both in theory and practice  @xcite .    in this paper , we examine quantum mechanisms for another economic scenario : resource allocation by auction  @xcite .",
    "while traditional auction mechanisms can efficiently allocate resources in many cases , quantum auction protocols offer improvements in preserving privacy of the losing bids and dealing with scenarios in which bidders care about what other bidders win when multiple items are auctioned . specifically , using quantum superpositions to represent bids prevents the auctioneer and other bidders from viewing the bids during the auction without disrupting the auction process .",
    "furthermore , the auction result reveals nothing but the winning bid and allocation .    the first part of the paper introduces a general quantum auction protocol for various pricing and allocation rules , multiple unit auctions , combinatorial auctions and partnership bids . for simplicity",
    ", we focus on the sealed - bid first - price auction . in this auction , each bidder has one opportunity to submit a bid .",
    "the winner is the highest bidder , who pays the amount bid for the item .",
    "this auction has been well studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , and contrasts with iterative auctions in which bidders can incrementally increase their bids depending on how others bid .",
    "if the auction is not well - matched to the bidders preferences , it can introduce perverse incentives and result in poor outcomes , such as lost revenue for the seller or economically inefficient allocations where items are not allocated to those who value them most .",
    "thus it is important to examine incentives introduced with a proposed auction design . in particular , our auction protocol involves quantum search , which introduces incentive issues beyond those examined in prior quantum games  @xcite .",
    "a full analysis of incentive issues is complicated , even for classical auctions . in this paper",
    "we focus on two incentive issues arising from the quantum auction protocol .",
    "the first incentive issue arises from the possibility of manipulating the search outcome by altering amplitudes associated with different bids .",
    "we show how to revise an adiabatic search method to correct this incentive problem , thereby preserving the classical nash equilibrium . from a quantum algorithm perspective , this construction of the search illustrates how incentive issues affect algorithm design , in contrast to the more common concern with computational efficiency in quantum information processing .",
    "second , the quantum search for the highest bid is probabilistic , i.e. , does not always return the highest bid . while the probability of finding the correct answer can be made as high as one",
    "wishes by using more iterations of the search , the small residue probability of awarding the item to someone other than the highest bidder may change bidding behavior . as a step toward addressing the effect of probabilistic outcomes ,",
    "we show that , with sufficient steps in the quantum search , altering choices from those of the corresponding deterministic auction gives at most a small improvement for that bidder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sect.discussion ] summarizes the quantum auction protocol and highlights a number of remaining economic questions .",
    "[ sect.auction ]    in our auction protocol , each bidder selects an operator that produces the desired bid from a prespecified initial state .",
    "the auctioneer repeatedly asks the bidders to apply their individual operators in a distributed implementation of a quantum search to find the winning bid .",
    "more specifically , the quantum auction protocol for sealed - bid auctions involves the following steps :    1 .",
    "auctioneer announces conventional aspects of the auction : type of auction ( e.g. , first or second price and any reservation prices ) , the good(s ) for sale , the allowed price granularity ( e.g. , if bids can specify values to the penny , or only to the dollar ) , and the criterion used to determine the winner(s ) , e.g. , maximizing revenue for the seller 2 .",
    "auctioneer announces how quantum states will be interpreted , i.e. , as specifying a price if only one good is for sale , or a combination of price and a set of goods if combinations are for sale ; and also announces the initial quantum state .",
    "this state uses @xmath0 qubits for each bidder .",
    "auctioneer announces the quantum search procedure .",
    "3 .   each bidder selects an operator on @xmath0 qubits .",
    "bidders keep their choice of operator private .",
    "auctioneer produces a set of particles implementing @xmath0 qubits for each bidder , initializing the set to the announced initial state .",
    "auctioneer and bidders perform a distributed search for the winner    fig .",
    "[ fig.schematic ] illustrates this procedure for two bidders and repeating the steps of the search twice .",
    "realistic search involves a larger number of steps .",
    "in contrast with other quantum games , e.g. , public goods , that involve just one round of interaction , the search required to identify the winners involves multiple rounds of interaction among the participants .",
    "the required number of iterations depends on the search method . in practice",
    ", the auctioneer could pick the number of iterations based on prior experience with similar auctions , or from simulating several test cases using valuations randomly drawn from a plausible distribution of values for the auction items .",
    "alternatively , the auctioneer could repeat the procedure several times ( possibly with steps from each repetition interleaved in a random order ) and use the best result from these repetitions .",
    "[ fig.schematic ]    this auction protocol uses a distributed search so bidders operator choices remain private .",
    "specifically , the search operation requiring input from the bidders is applied locally by each bidder , giving the overall operator @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of bidders and @xmath3 the operator of bidder @xmath4 .",
    ".notation for the quantum auction .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "[ sect.search ]    a quantum auction requires finding the winning bid and corresponding bidder .",
    "this procedure has two components : the interpretation of the qubits as bids , and the search procedure to find the winner .",
    "the following two subsections discuss these components in the context of a single - item auction .",
    "[ sect.multiple ] generalizes this discussion to multiple items .",
    "[ sect.bids ]    we define a _ bid _ as the amount a bidder indicates he is willing to pay for the item .",
    "an _ allocation _ is a list of bids , one from each bidder .",
    "the quantum auction protocol manipulates superpositions of allocations .",
    "we use an _ allocation rule _ to indicate how allocations specify a winner and amount paid .    consider an auction of one item with three bidders , willing to pay $ 1 , $ 3 and $ 10 for the item , respectively .",
    "we represent these bids as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the corresponding allocation as the product of these states , i.e. , @xmath8 with the ordering in the allocation understood to correspond to the bidders .",
    "a simple allocation rule selects the highest bidder as the winner , who pays the high bid . in this example , this rule results in the third bidder winning , and paying $ 10 for the item .",
    "each bidder gets @xmath9  qubits and can only operate on those bits .",
    "thus each bidder has @xmath10 possible bid values , and can create superpositions of these values .",
    "a superposition of bids specifies set of distinct bids , with at most one allowed to win .",
    "the amplitudes of the superposition affect the likelihood of various outcomes for the auction .",
    "for a single - item auction , a bidder will typically have only one bid . as discussed below",
    ", more complicated superpositions are useful for information hiding .",
    "specifically , bidder @xmath11 selects an operator @xmath12 on @xmath9  qubits to apply to the initial state for that bidder s qubits @xmath13  specified by the auctioneer .",
    "the resulting state , @xmath14 , is a superposition of bids , each of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is bidder @xmath11 s bid for the item .",
    "the subscript @xmath4 indicates one of the possible bids that can be specified with @xmath9  qubits according to the announced interpretation of the bits .",
    "we define the subspace used by bidder @xmath11 as the set of states spanned by the basis eigenvectors in @xmath17 .",
    "only these basis vectors appear in allocations relevant for the search .",
    "as bidders apply their operators during the search , the superposition of allocations remains within the subspace of each bidder . in this case , where each bidder applies an operator only to their own qubits , the superposition of allocations is always a factored form , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "more generally , groups of bidders could operate jointly on their qubits , entangling their bids in the allocations as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect.applications ] .    to exploit information hiding properties of superpositions , the state revealed at the end of the search",
    "should specify only the bidder who wins the item and the corresponding bid . to achieve this , instead of a direct representation of bids",
    ", we interpret bids formed from the @xmath9  qubits available to a bidder as containing a special null value , @xmath19 , indicating a bid for nothing .",
    "this null bid has additional benefits in multiple item settings , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect.multiple ] and sec .  [ sect.applications ] .",
    "consider bidder @xmath11 with two qubits and the initial state @xmath20 corresponding to the vector @xmath21 , which is interpreted as the null bid .",
    "the other bid states are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding to vectors ( 0,1,0,0 ) , ( 0,0,1,0 ) and ( 0,0,0,1 ) .",
    "these three states are interpreted as three bid values in some preannounced way , e.g. , $ 1 , $ 2 and $ 3 , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath25 gives the initial state @xmath14 as @xmath26 and specifies the search subspace whose basis is the first and third columns of @xmath27 in this example .",
    "thus the possible allocations involve only @xmath28 and @xmath29 for this bidder , corresponding to the null bid and a bid of $ 2 , respectively .    in the presence of a null bid",
    ", we consider an allocation to be a _",
    "feasible _ if it contains exactly one bid not equal to @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding allocation rule assigns no winner to infeasible allocations and , for feasible allocations , the winner is the single bidder in the allocation whose bid is not @xmath19 , and he pays the amount bid .",
    "this allocation rule corresponds to a first - price single - item auction , except there can be no winner , analogous to the situation in auctions with a reservation price when no bidder exceeds that price .",
    "[ sect.adiabatic ]    the auctioneer must find the best state according to an announced criterion , e.g. , maximum revenue . specifically , the auctioneer has a evaluation function @xmath30 assigning a quality value to each allocation .",
    "the function @xmath30 assigns a lower value to infeasible allocations than to any feasible one .",
    "an example is @xmath30 equal to the revenue produced by the allocation ( if feasible ) and otherwise is @xmath31 .",
    "the auctioneer uses quantum search to find the allocation in the subspace selected by the bidders giving the maximum value for @xmath30 ( e.g. , a feasible allocation giving the most revenue to the auctioneer ) .",
    "this could be done via repeated uses of a decision - problem quantum search  @xcite as a subroutine within a search for the minimum threshold value of @xmath30 giving a solution to the decision problem , e.g. , with a classical binary search on threshold values or using results of prior iterations of the decision problem  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we could use a method giving the maximum value directly ( e.g. , adiabatic  @xcite if run for a sufficiently long time or heuristic methods  @xcite based on some prior knowledge of the distribution of bidders values ) .",
    "for definiteness , we focus on the adiabatic method .    the adiabatic search is conventionally described as searching for the minimum _ cost _ state .",
    "we use this convention by defining a state s cost to be the negative of the evaluation function @xmath30 . the adiabatic search procedure , if run sufficiently slowly , changes the initial superposition into a final superposition in such a way that the amplitude in each initial eigenstate maps to the same amplitude in the corresponding final eigenstate , up to a phase factor ( for nondegenerate eigenstates ) .",
    "we refer to this mapping of initial to final eigenstates as a _",
    "perfect search_. in practice , with a finite time for the search , there will be some transfer of amplitude among the eigenstates so the search will not be perfect in the sense defined here .",
    "instead the auction outcome is probabilistic : the auction will not always produce the best outcome when starting from the ground state .",
    "for example , an auction intending to find the highest bid could sometimes produce the second highest bid instead .",
    "conventionally , the search operations are chosen so the uniform superposition is the lowest cost initial eigenstate . in our case , bidders are free to choose their operators and need not create uniform superpositions .",
    "a discrete implementation of adiabatic search consists of the following steps :    * the auctioneer selects a number of search steps @xmath32 and parameter @xmath33 .",
    "these need not be announced to the bidders . *",
    "the auctioneer initializes the state of all @xmath34 qubits to @xmath35 , with @xmath2 factors of @xmath36 in the product , and @xmath37 is the initial state for the @xmath0 qubits for a single bidder . *",
    "the auctioneer sends these initialized qubits to the bidders who use their individual operators and then return the qubits to the auctioneer , jointly creating the state @xmath38 * for @xmath39 , the auctioneer and bidders update the state to @xmath40 with @xmath41 the fraction of steps completed . the bid operator @xmath42 and its adjoint @xmath43",
    "are performed by sending bits to the bidders as described in sec .",
    "[ sect.auction ] . the diagonal matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are described below . *",
    "the auctioneer measures the state @xmath46 , resulting in specific values for all the bits , from which the winner and prices are determined by the allocation rule described in sec .",
    "[ sect.bids ] .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath45 adjusts the phases of the amplitudes according to the cost associated with each allocation .",
    "in particular , using the cost @xmath47 for allocation @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 similarly , the diagonal matrix @xmath44 adjusts amplitude phases as defined by a function @xmath50 : @xmath51 the key property of @xmath50 is assigning the smallest value , e.g. , 0 , to @xmath52 , thereby making the first column of @xmath42 the ground state eigenvector . aside from this key property ,",
    "the choice of @xmath50 is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the conventional choice in the adiabatic method uses the hamming weight of the state , i.e. , @xmath50 equal to the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of @xmath53 .",
    "however , as described in sec .",
    "[ sect.auctiondesign ] , other choices for @xmath50 can improve the incentive properties of the auction .",
    "the discrete - step implementation of the continuous adiabatic method  @xcite involves the limits @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in which case the final state @xmath56 has high probability to be the lowest cost state . in practice , this outcome can often be achieved with considerably fewer steps using a fixed value of @xmath33 , corresponding to a discrete version of the adiabatic method  @xcite .",
    "[ sect.statbehavior ]    ideally , an auction achieves the economic objective of its design ( e.g. maximum revenue for the seller ) . in practice",
    ", an auction design may not provide incentives for participants to behave so as to achieve this objective .",
    "usually auction designs are examined under the assumption of self - interested rational participants . in conventional auctions ,",
    "strategic issues include misrepresentation of the true value , collusion among bidders and false name bidding ( where a single bidder submits bids under several aliases ) . some of these issues can be addressed with suitable auction rules , e.g. , second price auctions encourage truthful reporting of values .",
    "developing suitable designs of classical auctions in a wide range of economic contexts remains a challenging problem  @xcite .",
    "quantum auctions raise strategic issues beyond those of classical auctions . in our case",
    ", every step of the adiabatic search requires each bidder to perform an operation on their qubits .",
    "ideally , the bidder should use the same operator @xmath42 for creating @xmath36 as in every step of the search in eq .",
    "( [ eq.search update ] ) .",
    "in addition , bidders should include the null bid in their subspaces . in the classical first - price sealed - bid auction ,",
    "the bidder makes one choice : the amount to bid . in our quantum setting , this choice amounts to selecting the subspace to use with the quantum search . the remaining freedom to select @xmath42 , and possibly a different @xmath42 for each step in the search , are additional choices provided by the quantum auction .",
    "bidders may be tempted to exploit the flexibility of choosing operators in several general ways .",
    "first , they could use a subspace not including the null bid .",
    "second , they could use a different operator for creating @xmath36 than they use in the rest of the search , thereby producing an altered initial amplitude that is not the ground state eigenvector .",
    "third they could change operators during the search .",
    "if any such changes give significant probability for low bids to win , bidders would be tempted to make such changes and include a low bid in their subspace , hoping to profit significantly by winning the auction with a low bid .",
    "the remainder of this section describes some strategic issues unique to quantum auctions and possible solutions .",
    "we further discuss a game theory analysis of some of these issues in sec .",
    "[ sect.auctiondesign ] .      [ sect.subspace choice ]",
    "the use of the null bid in our protocol raises the strategic issue illustrated in the following example :    consider an auction of a single item with two bidders alice and bob .",
    "using operators producing uniform amplitudes for the sake of illustration , they ought to apply operators that create    @xmath57 and @xmath58    respectively , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are their desired bids .",
    "the initial superposition for all the qubits is the product of these individual superpositions , i.e. , @xmath61 is @xmath62 if bidders use these same operators during the search , the search algorithm finds the highest revenue allocation , i.e. , giving the item to the highest bidder",
    ". suppose instead bob picks an operator with a one - dimensional subspace , producing an initial state @xmath63 rather than including @xmath64 .",
    "the product superposition is then @xmath65 since the search remains in this subspace and the second allocation is infeasible , the search will return @xmath66 no matter what alice bids .",
    "thus bob always wins the item , and can win using the lowest possible bid .",
    "this example shows bidders have an incentive to exclude the null set from their subspace .",
    "if all bidders make this choice , there will be no feasible allocations in the joint subspace and the auction will always give no winner . for auctions with more than two bidders , selecting subspaces excluding @xmath64 is a weak nash equilibrium for the quantum auction because any other choice by a single bidder still results in no feasible allocations .",
    "[ sect.initial amplitudes ]    strategic choices for bidders also arise from the search procedure itself , even when using the correct subspace consisting of @xmath64 and the desired bid . in particular",
    ", the probabilistic outcome of the search means the optimal bid according to the auction criterion ( e.g. , highest revenue ) will not always win . for the adiabatic search method , bidders could try to arrange for especially tiny eigenvalue gaps between the state corresponding to the best outcome and another state allowing them to win with a low bid .",
    "a sufficiently small gap could make the number of steps the auctioneer selects insufficient to give the optimal state with high probability and instead give a significant chance of producing the more favorable outcome .",
    "however , because the eigenvalues are a complicated function of the operators of all bidders , and individual bidders do not know the choices made by others , it will be difficult for a bidder to determine how to make such especially small gaps and do so in a way that gives a favorable outcome .",
    "nevertheless , even fairly small probabilities for not finding the optimal state could alter the strategic behavior of the bidders .",
    "increases from 0 to 1 , the eigenvalues of the four states change as shown schematically in the figure .",
    "the states for @xmath67 correspond to both bidders starting with the ground state , @xmath28 , the two states obtained if one of the bidders starts with a different superposition , @xmath68 and @xmath29 ( `` single - bidder deviation states '' ) , and the state of both bidders starting with different superpositions , @xmath69 ( `` 2-bidder deviation state '' ) . ]    [ fig.standard ]    a more direct way a bidder can arrange for a low bid to win is by altering the initial state of the adiabatic search to start not in the ground state but in an eigenvector corresponding to one of the first few eigenvalues above the ground state .",
    "the adiabatic search takes such eigenvectors , with high probability , to an outcome in which a bid lower than the highest wins . while a single bidder can not create an arbitrary initial condition , one bidder",
    "can ensure that it is not the ground state .",
    "for example , a bidder could chose an operator that gives a nonuniform amplitude for the initial state , in particular @xmath70 , while using the uniform state @xmath71 as the ground state through the remainder of the search in eq .",
    "( [ eq.search update ] ) .",
    "this can result in significant probability for a low bid to win , and so a bidder is tempted to deviate from the nominal operator choice .",
    "[ fig.standard ] illustrates this behavior . instead of starting in the ground state",
    ", the bidder s choice gives the initial state as a linear combination of the ground state and the single - deviation state for that bidder , denoted as @xmath68 or @xmath29 for the two bidders in fig .",
    "[ fig.standard ] . here",
    "a `` single deviation '' state is one that a single bidder can create , i.e. , by operating on just the qubits available to that bidder .",
    "the adiabatic search splits the degeneracy , thereby giving some probability for the lowest bid to win and some probability for an infeasible allocation .",
    "more generally , bidder @xmath4 uses this strategy by selecting two different operators @xmath72 and @xmath3 to use for forming the initial state and during the search , respectively .",
    "these choices result in different joint operators , in eq .",
    "( [ eq.u ] ) , used in eq .",
    "( [ eq.search init ] ) and ( [ eq.search update ] ) .    as with selecting a subspace without @xmath64 ,",
    "if many or all bidders make this choice , the initial state will have significant amplitude in eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues , which produce infeasible outcomes and hence a high probability for no winner .",
    "thus with standard adiabatic search , if everyone uses the same operator for both initialization and search , then each bidder is tempted to use a different initialization operator and bid low , gaining a chance to win with a low bid . however , if multiple bidders attempt this , the outcome will most likely be an infeasible state , with no winner .",
    "we can address this problem by reordering the eigenvalues given by the @xmath50 function in eq .",
    "( [ eq.search h0 ] ) so that any change in initial operator by a single bidder increases probability of infeasible allocation but not the probability of any feasible allocation with a bid lower than the highest bid .",
    "this is possible because bidders only have access to their own bits , so can only form initial superpositions from a limited set of basis vectors .",
    "[ fig.permuted ] illustrates the resulting situation .",
    "we give an analysis of this approach in sec .",
    "[ sect.behavior ] .",
    "[ fig.permuted ]      [ sect.change during search ]    the distributed search of eq .",
    "( [ eq.search update ] ) has each bidder using the same operator for every step of the search .",
    "thus bidders may gain some advantage by altering their operator during the steps of the search . gradually changing the operator during",
    "the search amounts to a different path from initial to final hamiltonian during the adiabatic search .",
    "thus , provided the auctioneer uses enough steps , such changes will have at most a minor effect on the outcome probabilities unless the bidder can arrange for particularly small eigenvalue gaps among favorable states .",
    "such arrangement is difficult , particularly since the bidder does not know the choices of other bidders and the auctioneer could treat the bits from the bidders in an arbitrary , unannounced order .",
    "more significant changes in outcome is possible with sudden , large changes in the operator during search . since the use of bidders operators gradually decreases during the search ( i.e. , @xmath73 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.search h0 ] ) approaches the identity operator as @xmath74 approaches 1 ) , the most problematic situation is for an abrupt change in operator at the beginning of the search .",
    "after such a change , the adiabatic search continues its gradual change of states , but now instead of starting in the ground state , it will instead have a linear combination of various states obtained by mapping the original basis onto the basis after the change .",
    "[ sect.auctiondesign ]    in this section , we focus on mechanism design to reduce incentive issues arising from the quantum aspects of the auction .",
    "we analyze incentive issues with the nash equilibrium ( ne ) concept commonly used to evaluate auctions  @xcite .",

    "[ sect.null set ]    one approach to the incentive to exclude the null set , described in sec .",
    "[ sect.subspace choice ] , is for the auctioneer to perform a second search : for the allocation with the most @xmath19  values .",
    "this search uses the same distributed protocol of eq .",
    "( [ eq.search update ] ) but with separate qubits and a different cost function to define @xmath45 , i.e. , setting @xmath75 to the number of non-@xmath19  values in the allocation @xmath53 . interleaving the additional search in a random order within the steps of the search for the winning bid",
    "prevents bidders from knowing which search a given step belongs to .",
    "so bidders could not consistently select different operators for the two searches .    if all bidders include @xmath64 in their selected subspace , this additional search returns @xmath76 .",
    "any bidder found not to have included @xmath64 could be excluded from winning the auction . at this point",
    "the auctioneer could either announce there is no winner , or restart the auction for the remaining bidders without announcing this restart .",
    "the adiabatic search has a small but nonzero probability of returning the wrong result , which would then incorrectly conclude some bidder did not include @xmath19 . as long as the probability of such errors is smaller than the error probability of the search for the winner , these errors should not greatly affect the incentive structure of the mechanism . alternatively , the auctioneer could use a search completing with probability one in a finite number of steps , i.e. , with different choices of @xmath77 and @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.search update ] ) , the auctioneer could implement grover s algorithm  @xcite to search for the allocation @xmath76 in the joint subspace of the bidders . since the auctioneer does not know the size of the subspaces selected by the bidders",

    "unlike the adiabatic search , failure would only indicate _ some _ bidder had not included @xmath19 , but not which one .",
    "thus the auctioneer s only alternative in this case is to announce the auction has no winner .    while this approach removes the immediate benefit of not including the null bid , its affect on broader strategic issues in the full auction is an open question .",
    "[ sect.behavior ]    in this section we examine the incentive structure of the auction with permuted eigenstates described in sec .  [ sect.initial amplitudes ] .",
    "we first review how game theory applies to auctions .",
    "we then consider the quantum auction when the search runs long enough to give successful completion almost always ( `` perfect search '' ) .",
    "finally , we consider the more realistic case of search with small , but not negligible , probability for non - optimal outcomes .",

    "bids are on arbitrary sets of items or _ bundles _ , and we represent a bundle with @xmath239  bits , 1 if the corresponding item is a part of the bundle and 0 otherwise , i.e. , @xmath240 . we focus on this general case in the remainder of the section . allowing bids on sets of items",
    "is called a combinatorial auction  @xcite .    with multiple items , the bid operator",
    "@xmath14 gives a superposition of bids of the form @xmath241 where @xmath16 is bidder @xmath11 s bid for a bundle of items @xmath242 . in this notation ,",
    "the null bid is @xmath243 , and the specified amount @xmath87 is irrelevant so we take it to be zero in the examples .",
    "a superposition specifies a set of distinct bids , with at most one allowed to win .",
    "consider a combinatorial auction with two items @xmath244 , @xmath245 and integer prices ranging from 0 to 3 . with @xmath246 bits for each bidder , using 2 bits each to specify item bundles and prices , is sufficient to specify the bids .",
    "the full space for a bidder has dimension @xmath247 , consisting of @xmath248 possible item bundle choices and @xmath248 price choices .",
    "suppose a bidder places a bid @xmath249 i.e. , a bid of 1 for item x alone , and 2 for the bundle of both items . in this case",
    ", the bidder is not interested in item @xmath245 by itself .",
    "the dimension of the subspace of this bid is 3 .",
    "another example is the bid @xmath250 the dimension of the subspace is 4 .",
    "this superposition has multiple bids on the same item @xmath244 .",
    "this bidding language is both expressive and compact .",
    "for instance , a superposition of bundles of items readily expresses exclusive - or preferences , where a bidder wants at most one of the bundles .",
    "it is also compact because superpositions allow the bidder to use exactly the same qubits to place no bid ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) and to place all the exponential number of bundles in a combinatorial auction .    an allocation , as defined in sec .  [ sect.bids ] , is a list of bids , one from each bidder . with multiple items ,",
    "an allocation is feasible if the item sets are pairwise disjoint . as in the single item case",
    ", we consider the allocation when all item sets are empty as infeasible .",
    "the value of a feasible allocation is the sum total of the bid values of the different bids in the allocation .",
    "the number of feasible states is @xmath251 .",
    "this is because we can assign @xmath239  items among @xmath79  bidders where all items need not be allocated in @xmath252 ways .",
    "the factor @xmath253 allows for some items to remain unallocated .",
    "since the allocation when all bidders place the null bid is an infeasible state , we subtract 1 .",
    "each bidder can specify @xmath254 different prices for the bundle giving @xmath255 possible choices for @xmath79bidders .",
    "note that the number of feasible states for a single item , @xmath256 , is different from that in sec .",
    "[ sect.behavior ] because here we have changed the bidding language to represent items also .",
    "the null bid in our protocol simplifies the evaluation of allocations for combinatorial auctions . to see this ,",
    "consider a protocol without the null bid . in a single item case , @xmath257 for",
    "any allocation vector @xmath53 would be maximum of the bids placed by the different bidders on the item , which is fairly easy to compute .",
    "but in the case of multiple items , there could be several allocations for a vector @xmath53 .",
    "for example suppose alice bids on the set @xmath258 and bob bids on @xmath259 . without the null set",
    "then both bids appear in the same state and have to be evaluated by @xmath257 .",
    "the possible allocation to the bidders are    1 .",
    "none to either 2 .",
    "@xmath258 to alice 3 .",
    "@xmath259 to bob , and 4 .",
    "@xmath258 to alice and @xmath259 to bob ( which is infeasible )    @xmath257 will have to compute the maximum of the values in all these states .",
    "this is computationally complex when there are many items .",
    "by contrast , the bidding language with the null bid avoids this combinatorial evaluation within the search function @xmath257 .    as in the case of single item auctions ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a one - shot sealed bid classical combinatorial auction that we implement in a quantum setting .",
    "the total number of states is @xmath260 and the total number of single bidder deviations states is @xmath261 .",
    "these expressions are the same as the single item case .",
    "the condition for all single - deviation states to be mapped to infeasible allocations , resulting in no winner , is @xmath262 this condition holds for cases relevant for auctions as seen in the following claim .",
    "[ multiclaim ] eq .",
    "( [ eq.multiitemcondition ] ) is true for all integers @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "recall @xmath265 .",
    "we prove a stronger condition for integers @xmath266 , i.e. , there exists enough infeasible states to handle joint deviations up to @xmath114 bidders .",
    "the number of @xmath109-bidder deviation states is the same as the single - item case , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq.k deviation states ] ) .",
    "thus this stronger condition , with the same right - hand side as eq .",
    "( [ eq.condition with collusion ] ) , is @xmath267 hence eq .",
    "( [ eq.multiitemcollusion ] ) is true if @xmath268 since @xmath269 , eq .",
    "( [ eq.multiitemcollusion ] ) is true if @xmath270 which is true if @xmath271    let @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "we establish the required inequality , @xmath274 , by showing @xmath275 is increasing in @xmath276 when @xmath277 , @xmath278 is decreasing in @xmath2 when @xmath264 and noting @xmath279 .    taking the derivative of @xmath275 with respect to @xmath276 , we get , @xmath280 this is positive if and only if @xmath281 this is true because @xmath282 and hence both fractions in the expression are greater than 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath275 is increasing for all @xmath277 .    taking derivative of @xmath278 with respect to @xmath2",
    ", we get , @xmath283 this is negative if and only if @xmath284 this is true for @xmath285 2 .",
    "thus @xmath278 is decreasing in @xmath2 for @xmath264 .",
    "thus we have shown that eq .",
    "( [ eq.multiitemcondition ] ) is true for @xmath266 .",
    "it can be easily checked that eq .",
    "( [ eq.multiitemcondition ] ) , is not true for @xmath286 and true when @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "thus , if a classical combinatorial auction has a ne then the corresponding quantum auction protocol also has a ne with respect to initial state deviations .",
    "also there is an @xmath159-equilibrium of the same auction with an imperfect search using @xmath160 search steps .",
    "moreover , the stronger condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq.multiitemcollusion ] ) shows that in auctions with at least two bidders ( @xmath289 ) , there are enough infeasible states to give no winner for any deviation of initial amplitudes that up to @xmath114 can produce .",
    "thus no groups , up to size @xmath114 , can collude to benefit from initial amplitude deviations in the quantum auction .",
    "[ sect.applications ]    two properties of quantum information may provide benefits to auctioneers and bidders : the ability to compactly express complicated combinations of preferences via superpositions and entanglement and the destruction of the quantum state upon measurement .",
    "this section describes some economic scenarios that could benefit from these properties .",
    "as one economic application , quantum auctions provide a natural way to solve the _ allocative externality _ problem  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , a bidder s value for an item depends on the items received by other bidders .",
    "for example , consider companies bidding on a big government project requiring multiple companies to work on different parts .",
    "allocative externality refers to the issue that the costs for a company which wins a contract for one part depends on which other companies win other parts .",
    "so company a may be willing to bid more aggressively if it knows that company b will work on related parts .",
    "multiple simultaneous auctions for separate parts will not handle these interdependencies and thus will be inefficient .",
    "one possible solution is to let companies form partnership bids .",
    "that is joint bids that are accepted together or not at all . quantum information processing allows for a natural way of forming partnership bids via entanglement . with the protocol described in sec .",
    "[ sect.multiple ] , multiple bids can be entangled so they will either all be accepted together or none will be .",
    "furthermore , quantum auctions may provide more flexibility with respect to information privacy of partnership bids than classical methods .",
    "specifically , with multiple items , groups of bidders could select joint operators on their combined qubits , allowing them to express joint constraints ( e.g. , where they either all win their specified items or none of them do ) without any of the other bidders or auctioneer knowing this choice .",
    "the bidders do so by creating an entangled state instead of the factored form for their qubits .",
    "thus employing quantum entanglement provides bidders a natural way for expressing any allocative externality .",
    "this possibility shows bidding languages based on qubits are highly expressive and compact because bidders can use the same bits to express their individual bids and joint bids via entanglement .",
    "alice and bob could jointly form the state @xmath290 to represent the bidders willing to pay @xmath291 and @xmath292 for items @xmath293 and @xmath294 , or to pay @xmath295 and @xmath296 for items @xmath297 and @xmath298 , but they are not willing to buy other combinations , such as @xmath293 for alice and @xmath298 for bob .    in this scenario , a direct representation of bids ,",
    "i.e. , without a null bid , would not guarantee the joint preferences are satisfied for all entangled bidders or none of them .",
    "that is , without null bids , the superposition could not express the joint preference through entanglement .",
    "a group of @xmath109 bidders operating jointly on their qubits to form entangled bids could also produce initial amplitudes involving up to @xmath109-bidder deviation states .",
    "however the discussion with eq .",
    "( [ eq.multiitemcollusion ] ) on multiple item auctions shows our protocol can handle all deviation states a group of up to @xmath114 bidders can produce , i.e. , by mapping them to infeasible outcomes .",
    "thus the additional expressivity used for joint bids does not introduce additional opportunities for collusion to change the outcomes via initial amplitude selection .",
    "a second economic application for quantum auctions arises from their privacy guarantee for losing bids .",
    "this property is economically useful when bidders have incentives to hide information .",
    "an example is a scenario in which companies are bidding for government contracts year after year .",
    "a company s bid usually contains information about its cost structure .",
    "if there is reasonable expectation that the losing bids will be revealed , a company may want to bid less aggressively to reduce the amount of information passed to its competition for use in future auctions .",
    "this will lead to a less efficient auction than if bidders reveal their true values .",
    "in this situation , a privacy guarantee on the losing bids enables bidders to bid with less inhibition .",
    "more generally , this privacy issue is only relevant when there are additional interactions between these companies after the auction is concluded , such as future auctions or negotiations where participants may be at a disadvantage if their values are known to others .",
    "this strong privacy property is unique to quantum information processing .",
    "privacy can be enforced via cryptographic methods for multi - player computation  @xcite , and in an auction can keep losing bids secret  @xcite .",
    "however , the information on the bids , and the key to decrypt them , remains after the auction completes .",
    "people who have access to the key may be legally compelled to reveal the information or choose to sell it .",
    "so while cryptography can be secured computationally , it can not guarantee the integrity of the person(s ) who have the means to decrypt the information . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum method destroys losing bids during the search for the winning one and it is physically impossible to reconstruct the bids after the auction process .",
    "similarly , some of the other properties of quantum auctions , such as correlations for partnership bids , can be provided classically  @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum mechanisms are readily simulated classically  @xcite ( as long as they involve at most 20 to 30 qubits ) .",
    "however , these classical approaches lack the information security of quantum states .",
    "more study is needed to determine scenarios where the privacy property of the quantum protocol is significant .",
    "[ sect.discussion ]    this paper describes a quantum protocol for auctions , gives a game theory analysis of some strategic issues the protocol raises and suggests economic scenarios that could benefit from these auctions .",
    "these include the privacy of bids and the possibility of addressing allocative externalities .",
    "the search used in our protocol can use arbitrary criteria for evaluating allocations , thereby implementing other types of auctions with quantum states .",
    "thus while we focus our attention on the first - price sealed - bid auction , the protocol is more general : it can implement other pricing and allocation rules , as well as multiple - unit - multiple - item auctions with combinatorial bids . for example we can use this protocol in a multiple stage , iterative auction .",
    "in fact , the protocol supports general bidding languages .",
    "encoding bids in quantum states raises new game theory issues because the bidders strategic choices include specifying amplitudes in the quantum states .",
    "the auction is not only probabilistic , but the winning probability is not just a function of the amount bid . instead a bidder can change the probability of winning by altering the amplitudes of the quantum states encoding his bid .",
    "for example , in the context of the first - price sealed - bid auction , the auction does not guarantee the allocation of the item to the highest bidder .",
    "we show that the correct design of the protocol can solve a specific version of this incentive problem .",
    "the salient design feature is an incentive compatible mechanism so that bidders do not want to cheat , as opposed to an algorithmic secure protocol that prevents bidders from cheating .",
    "thus , our design is an example of a quantum algorithm , in this case adiabatic search , tuned to improve incentive issues rather than the usual focus in quantum information processing on computation or security properties of algorithms .",
    "in addition , we show that the nash equilibrium of the corresponding classical first - price sealed - bid auction is an @xmath159-equilibrium of the quantum auction and that @xmath159 converges to zero when the quantum search associated with the protocol uses an increasing number of steps , under the conditions listed in theorem  [ thm.ne ] .",
    "this result is with respect to changes in the initial state of the search .",
    "it remains to be seen whether other bidder strategies give some unilateral benefit , requiring further adjustments to the auction design .",
    "there are multiple directions for future work .",
    "first , we plan a series of human subject experiments on whether people can indeed bid effectively in the simple quantum auction scenario described in this paper . as with previous experiments with a quantum public goods mechanism  @xcite ,",
    "such experiments are useful tests of the applicability of game theory in practice , and also suggest useful training and decision support tools .",
    "in particular , people s behavior in a quantum auction could differ from game theory predictions that people select a nash equilibrium based on idealized assumptions of human rationality and full ability to evaluate consequences of strategic choices with uncertainty .",
    "second , we plan to extend studies of quantum auctions to more complicated economic scenarios , such as one with allocative externality .",
    "our analysis considers a single auction .",
    "an interesting extension is to a series of auctions for similar items . if auctions are repeated , the game theory analysis is more complicated  @xcite .",
    "in particular , privacy concerns become more significant since information revealed by a bidder s behavior in one auction may benefit other bidders in later auctions .",
    "the quantum auction destroys all information about the losing bids . as a result , it is not possible to conduct after - the - fact audits to verify that the auction has been conducted correctly .",
    "is there a way to modify the mechanism to enable audits while preserving some of the privacy guarantees ?",
    "security is another interesting issue .",
    "for example , there may be third parties , aside from the auctioneer and bidders who are interested in intercepting and changing bits in transit .",
    "auctioneers may have incentives to detect a bidder s bid or skew auction results .",
    "the question is whether we can build security around the protocol to prevent or at least detect these types of attacks .",
    "similarly , many economics issues surrounding the protocol remain to be resolved .",
    "for example , people behave as if they are risk averse in auction situations  @xcite which can change the predictions of game theory .",
    "another issue arises from the possibility of multiple nash equilibria .",
    "we have only shown that the desirable outcome is _ an _ equilibrium .",
    "the quantum protocol can also have other equilibria .",
    "since the nash equilibrium concept alone does not indicate how people select one equilibrium over another , additional study is needed to determine when the desirable outcome is likely to occur .",
    "our protocol makes only limited use of quantum states , in particular encoding bids in the subspace selected by the bidders but not using the amplitudes separately .",
    "thus it would be interesting to examine extensions to the protocol exploiting the wider range of options for bidders .",
    "for example , a protocol might use amplitudes of superpositions to indicate a bidder s probabilistic preferences , say , as in constructing a portfolio of items with various expected values and risks .",
    "such portfolios could be useful if bidders have some uncertainty in their values ( e.g. , in bidding for oil field exploration rights ) rather than the standard private value framework considered in this paper , where bidders know their own values for the items .",
    "with uncertain values , probabilistic bids could allow bidders to match their risk preferences along with their value estimates within the auction process .    as a final note , the number of qubits necessary to conduct an auction is small compared to the requirement of complex computations such as factoring .",
    "for example , if each bidder uses 7 bits ( corresponding to @xmath299 or about 100 bid values ) and there are 3 bidders , about 25 qubits are needed , considerably less than thousands needed for factoring interesting - sized numbers .",
    "thus with the advancement of quantum information processing technologies , economics mechanisms could be early feasible applications .",
    "we have benefited from discussions with raymond beausoleil , saikat guha , philip kuekes , andrew landahl and tim spiller . this work was supported by darpa funding via the army research office contract # w911nf0530002 to dr .",
