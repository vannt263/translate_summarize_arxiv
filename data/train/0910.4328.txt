    "in these two decades , many circumstellar disks around young forming / formed stars less than several solar masses are found by direct images in the infrared / visible observations ( e.g. mccaughrean & odell 1996 ; fukagawa et al . 2004 ; fujiwara et al .",
    "2006 ; lagage et al .",
    "2006 ; see also web database ) .",
    "radio , infrared , and visible line observations confirmed that some disks have rotating disk kinematics as expected ( simon , dutrey , & guilloteau 2000 ; pontoppidan et al . 2008 ; acke , van den ancker , dullemond 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast , the formation scenario for massive stars ( @xmath38m@xmath4 ) is still unclear . since , for such massive stars , the time scale for the kelvin - helmholtz contraction is shorter than that of free - fall or accretion with accretion rate similar to low mass star cases , they start releasing energy through nuclear fusion even during accretion ( palla & stahler 1993 ) .",
    "then radiation pressure due to their large luminosities may prevent surrounding material from accreting onto the star , in particular , in the case of very massive stars ( kahn 1974 ; wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) .",
    "several ideas are proposed to overcome the problem : mass accretion through circumstellar disks ( yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ; krumholz et al .",
    "2009 ) , mass accretion under a much larger accretion rate than that usually considered for low mass stars ( mckee & tan 2002 ; krumholz et al . 2009 ) , or merging of low mass stars ( bonnell , vine , & bate 2004 ) . among these ideas ,",
    "non - isotropic accretion through their circumstellar disks seems most plausible at present .",
    "such non - isotropic accretion alleviates effective radiation pressure on the accreting material .",
    "supporting evidence for this disk scenario is recent discoveries of rotating gas fragments around possible massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) by interferometric observations in the radio , especially in millimeter and submillimeter wavelength regions ( cesaroni et al .",
    "some of them have a velocity gradient in a direction orthogonal to molecular outflow lobes , which suggests that the gas fragments rotate around the central ysos ( zhang , hunter , sridharan 1998 ; cesaroni et al .",
    "about a dozen of objects as candidate disks around massive ysos of up to 20m@xmath4 are found so far ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ; patel et al . 2005 ; cesaroni et al . 2006 ; beltrn et al . 2006 ; cesaroni et al . 2007 ) .",
    "typically , their estimated stellar mass , luminosity , and disk radius are 4 to less than about 20m@xmath0 , a few @xmath5(10@xmath610@xmath7)l@xmath0 , and 5002000au , respectively .",
    "it is suggested that early b herbig be stars are surrounded by flattened structures from measurement of depolarization across h@xmath8 line although the discussed scale is much smaller ( order of several stellar radii ) than the disk size indicated above ( vink et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "while radio interferometric observations have so far been the most successful in unveiling the disk existence around massive ysos , the resolution around 1@xmath9 is not sufficient to draw the detailed disk geometry .",
    "it is in contrast to the situation that disks around young forming stars less than several solar masses have been well depicted by direct images in visible to infrared wavelengths .",
    "for some massive ysos , existence of disks is discussed from the polarization vector distribution of infrared scattered light image of the outflow cavities ( jiang et al . 2005 ) , but their disks themselves are not seen because such objects are still embedded deeply in their envelopes .",
    "direct images are strongly required to establish the existence and shape of the disks around massive ysos .",
    "our new approach is to search for disks in the mid - infrared around massive ysos that have emerged from their natal clouds .",
    "owing to the large luminosities of the central stars , the disk surface can be heated up out to large radii enough to be resolved in the mid - infrared with 8m - class telescopes , which provide 100au resolution for nearby ( @xmath1400pc ) targets .",
    "we carry out survey observations for extended emission around herbig be stars and report the discovery of a disk around hd200775 in this paper .",
    "hd200775 is a herbig be star located at 430@xmath10pc from the sunpc .",
    "their estimate , however , also suggests a much lower stellar mass for hd200775 , which obviously conflicts with the established spectral type . since the original estimate of 430pc agrees with the distance by monnier et al .",

    "( 2008 ) is based not on the measured mass but on the line profiles . as a result",

    "the orbital parameters , luminosity , spectrum analysis , and spectral type can all be accounted for consistently by the assumed distance of 430pc .",

    "it corresponds to a passive disk where the disk is mainly heated by the radiation onto the disk surface , which is consistent with the fact that the outflow is not active in hd200775 s case .",

    "it seems to correspond to the shallower brightness slope for 11.7@xmath2 m and suggests that the fit procedure works well .",
    "the real inner radius could be smaller due to possible false removal of the emission in the clean procedure , where we allowed multiple peak detection within 0.33@xmath9 radius for 8.8@xmath2 m and 0.46@xmath9 for 11.7@xmath2 m from the brightest peak .",

    "it supports the idea that there is a qualitative difference between disks around massive stars and low mass stars .",
    "it may be related to rapid disruption of disks around massive stars due to the large luminosities and/or photoevaporation ( see @xmath404.4 ) .    in a hydrostatic disk in keplerian rotation around a star",

    "we assume that the hydrostatic structure is determined based on the temperature at the equatorial plane and the surface density of the disk , both of which have power - law dependence on radius .",
    "also we assume that the temperature decreases as the radius .",
    "owing to the large uncertainty in @xmath8 , we could not conclude from the model fit whether or not the hd200775 disk is flared more steeply than the hd97048 disk ( @xmath8=1.26 ) , which is consistent with a hydrostatic one . in our fitting",
    ", we fix @xmath8 between 0 and 4.1 with a step of 0.1 and search for a combination of the free parameters that minimizes the squared sum of difference between the model images and the observed images .",
    "we find that @xmath36 is strongly correlated with @xmath8 in our model fitting .",
    "thus @xmath36 and @xmath8 can not be determined independently",
    ". however , the disk height within @xmath53 tends to become similar even if the combination of @xmath36 and @xmath8 changes .",
    "the other parameters ( @xmath54 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 ) does not change largely .    the disk detected here is clearly related with the past outflow activity , binary orbit , and inclination of the star .",
    "it strongly suggests that this star is still at a pre - main sequence stage , as discussed by alecian et al .",
    "the present observations indicates the presence of a disk around a high - mass pre - main sequence star .",
    "figure 7 shows the distribution of color temperature of the hd200775 circumbinary disk .",
    "it is estimated by using the brightness ratios of the 11.7 and 18.8@xmath2 m images where the unresolved components are subtracted .",
    "the difference of the diffraction size in the two bands is not corrected here .",
    "in addition , the 11.7 and 18.8@xmath2 m bands contain contributions from the silicate feature emission , from which the estimated temperature may suffer .",
    "the iso / sws spectrum toward hd200775 shows the moderate silicate emission at 10@xmath2 m region , but has no prominent silicate emission at 18.8@xmath2 m region .",
    "the 11.7@xmath2 m band is located at the skirt of the 10@xmath2 m silicate feature .",
    "thus the estimated temperatures may be overestimated .",
    "since it is not necessary that the flux at the two bands comes exactly from the same grains and areas , the actual temperature distribution would be more complicated : grains at the surface has higher temperatures and those at a deeper location in the disk have lower temperatures .",
    "figure 7 indicates that the color temperature is @xmath1180330k .",
    "black grains becomes only 113k or 149k at 430au and 77k or 97k at 1000au from a 6000l@xmath0 or 15000l@xmath0 star , respectively .",
    "it suggests that the grains are not blackbodies but they are small and absorb the stellar photons efficiently in visible wavelengths and radiate in the infrared inefficiently .",
    "figure 8 shows the temperature distribution of blackbody and small ( radius @xmath55=0.1 and 1@xmath2 m ) grains that absorb the stellar light completely but have an emissivity of @xmath56 in the infrared .",
    "it suggests that grains of @xmath10.1@xmath2 m radius have temperatures similar to that of the observed diffuse disk emission .    by assuming amorphous mg - pure pyroxene grains with 0.1@xmath2 m radius ( jger et al .",
    "2003 ; see section 4.5 ) at 300k , we derive the mass of the dust emitting at 10@xmath2 m as 8@xmath57m@xmath4 .",
    "the total mass including gas is very small ( 8@xmath58m@xmath4 ) , when the gas - to - dust mass ratio is assumed as 100 . also it is difficult to heat up grains in the midplane warm enough ( @xmath59300k ) to be detected in the 10@xmath2 m bands at the observed large radii in a passive disk .",
    "we conclude that the mid - infrared disk emission arises from the disk atmosphere , or the superheated surface layer illuminated directly by the central star as modeled for low to intermediate mass stars ( chiang & goldreich 1997 , chiang et al .",
    "2001 , dullemond & dominik 2004 ) .",
    "if the beam filling factor by the diffuse disk emission is assumed as unity , the brightness at 10 and 18.8@xmath2 m suggests the optical depth in the mid - infrared ( @xmath60 ) of @xmath61@xmath62 and @xmath63@xmath61 for the dust temperatures of 300k and 200k , respectively .",
    "it corresponds to the optical depth at 0.55@xmath2 m ( @xmath64 ) of @xmath65@xmath61 .",
    "it should be noted that the optical depth @xmath64 normal to the disk surface is smaller than most model predictions ( e.g. chiang & goldreich 1997 ; @xmath66 for the hd200775 disk ) where it is assumed that the surface height is proportional to the vertical gas scale height at any radius and that the absorbed flux of the stellar radiation at the disk surface is proportional to the sine of the local grazing angle ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the small optical depth .",
    "firstly , the temperatures of the dust emitting in the mid - infrared region might be lower than those assumed ( 300k for 10@xmath2 m region and 200k for 20@xmath2 m region , respectively ) .",
    "as we mentioned , the silicate features may cause overestimate of the temperatures .",
    "if the dust temperature is 150k , the optical depth in the 10@xmath2 m region becomes 60 to 240 times higher .",
    "secondly , the photospheric emission of hd2000775 ( @xmath68=19000k ) peaks around 0.1@xmath2 m in the ultra - violet ( uv ) region .",
    "the interstellar extinction at 0.1@xmath2 m is larger than at the v - band as @xmath69/@xmath70 is about 5 in a typical case or higher ( @xmath110 ) in other cases ( ryter 1996 ) . since the thickness or the optical depth of the disk atmosphere",
    "is determined so that the most stellar emission is absorbed by the disk surface , the thickness of the hd200775 disk case is likely to be determined by the optical depth at the uv rather than visible wavelengths .",
    "thirdly , the ratio of extinction between the mid - infrared and optical wavelengths for grains in the hd200775 disk may not be the same for interstellar grains we assumed ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "in fact , it is suggested that the grains in the hd200775 disk are different from those in the interstellar medium ( ism ) as discussed in @xmath404.5 .",
    "if @xmath71 in hd200775 is much larger than the ism , we will have a larger @xmath64 .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 becomes larger if the grains are much blacker in the visible to uv wavelengths than in the ism , or if the grains have much lower emissivity in the mid - infrared than in the ism .",
    "lastly , the small optical depth in hd200775 might be understood in terms of the thermal instability of protoplanetary disks .",
    "watanabe & lin 2008 predict that thermal wave can be excited to make ripples of the disk surface in a disk with a low accretion rate .",
    "they predict that @xmath64 normal to the disk is @xmath11 only at the excited ripples ( thermal wave pulse ) and becomes much lower ( a few tenths to less than @xmath63 ) at the other most areas .",
    "the ratio of the infrared excess emission ( @xmath72 ) to the total luminosity ( @xmath73 ) is estimated to be 0.07 from the sed ( acke & van den ancker 2004 ) . the flared geometry derived by our disk model fit gives the fraction of the intercepted stellar radiation of 0.120.27 .",
    "taking account of the radial optical opacity of the surface layer ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 becomes much lower than that from the sed .",
    "it can be attributed partly to the small @xmath64 again , and partly to the following fact . in hd200775 ,",
    "extended far infrared emission that roughly traces the outflow cavity wall ( ngc7023 ) is detected ( kirk et al .",
    "2009 ; we also confirmed it with data of akari satellite ( murakami et al .",
    "therefore the far infrared flux of the sed ( iras data and even iso data ) has a significant contribution from the wall .",
    "the large @xmath75 of 0.07 indicates that the cavity wall intercepts a large fraction of the stellar flux .",
    "the disk itself does not have to absorb a large fraction .      from our 350.3ghz sma observations",
    ", we detected an unresolved emission source of 35.1@xmath115.2mjy at the star position with the 1@xmath76 noise level of 3.0mjy / beam ( fig .",
    "if we assume the mass absorption coefficient in the radio region given by hildebrand ( 1983 ) and the spectrum ( flux @xmath77 ) slope from submillimeter to millimeter wavelengths as @xmath78 , the mass opacity at 350ghz becomes 0.0085@xmath79g@xmath80 .",
    "then the observed flux gives a lower limit for the total disk mass ( @xmath81 ) of 0.022 or 0.010m@xmath4 for the dust temperature at the midplane of 50k or 100k ( @xmath82 ) , respectively .",
    "the assumed spectrum slope is in agreement with the sed in acke and van den ancker ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is also compatible with the upper limit of the flux at 1.3 mm ( @xmath836mjy ) of past bolometer observations of a 10@xmath9 beam ( fuente et al .",
    "the slope indicates that a majority of the grains in hd200775 is small in size and not fully grown since large grains have a slower wavelength dependence .    the mass above is similar to the estimated minimum mass for the protoplanetary disk around the sun . if it is distributed uniformly in a sphere of the beam radius ( 180au ) , it amounts to visible extinction of @xmath3190mag toward the central star , which is much larger than the observed one ( 1.8 and 3.0mag under @xmath13=3.1 and 5.0 , respectively ; hernndez et al .",
    "2004 ) . here , we assume the optical to mid - infrared extinction ratio given by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) and @xmath84 value in cox ( 2001 ) .",
    "thus the mass must be distributed in a flattened structure , which consists of the inner part of the disk .",
    "if we assume the brightness of the 2@xmath76 detection limit of our sma observations ( 6mjy / beam ) for the extended emission , the mid - infrared extinction becomes at least 2.0mag ( for 100k dust ) or 4.4mag ( for 50k dust ) at 11.7@xmath2 m even in the outer region .",
    "extinction at 8.8@xmath2 m is 1.5 times larger than that at 11.7@xmath2 m ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "extinction at 18.8@xmath2 m is not well known and we assume that it is similar to that at 11.7@xmath2 m ( draine & lee 1984 ; mcclure 2009 ) .",
    "then , the mid - infrared emission from the further side of the disk should be extinguished mostly by the midplane before reaching us even in the outer region .",
    "the observations of the mid - infrared and 350ghz can be interpreted in terms of the thick disk in the mid - infrared .",
    "while the disk shows geometry and structures relatively similar to low mass stars as described above , there are clear differences , too .",
    "since the primary star is hot enough , its ionizing photons can photoionize the disk gas .",
    "it leads to disk dispersal due to photoevaporation in the region where the sound speed of ionized gas exceeds the escape speed against gravity .",
    "the inner radius ( photoevaporation radius @xmath85 ) is estimated as @xmath170au for a 10m@xmath4 star in a weak stellar wind case ( hollenbach et al .",
    "the mid - infrared elliptical emission of hd200775 corresponds to the region outside @xmath85 .",
    "the distribution of the free - free emission at 3.4 mm detected toward hd200775 ( fuente et al .",
    "2001 ) resembles the elliptical disk and the tail in the mid - infrared well in size and shape . though it was considered to arise from the stellar wind previously ( fuente et al .",
    "2001 ) , the 3.4 mm and mid - infrared emissions are likely to trace the surface of the photoevaporating disk ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "when we assume the ionizing flux from a b3 zero - age main sequence star ( @xmath86 photons s@xmath80 ; panagia 1973 ) , the mass loss rate due to the photoevaporation is estimated as 7.7@xmath87m@xmath4yr@xmath80 ( hollenbach et al . 1994 ) .",
    "it suggests that a mass of 0.01m@xmath4 to 0.1m@xmath4 will be dispersed within an order of 1000 to 10000yrs .",
    "the disk around hd200775 seems to be a short - lived phenomenon .",
    "the spatially resolved 10@xmath2 m band spectra of the circumstellar disks have much information on the properties of grains and related processes ( e.g. , okamoto et al .",
    "4 shows the spectra of the unresolved source and at a typical position in the diffuse disk along the major axis .    the spectrum of the unresolved source ( fig .",
    "4a ) is dominated by the featureless continuum emission and shows the line at 12.37@xmath2 m of n=7@xmath886 and n=11@xmath888 transitions with a line flux of ( 4.1@xmath89wm@xmath90 .",
    "the innermost disk is well heated deep into the midplane and radiates an optically thick blackbody emission .",
    "the temperature estimated from the spectrum is 1600k ( @xmath31000k considering the 1 @xmath76 error of the flux calibration ) , which is close to the evaporation temperature of silicate and graphite .",
    "black grains illuminated by a 15000l@xmath4 star become 1600k at 3.7au from the star .",
    "since it is smaller than the binary orbit , the unresolved source emission arises not from the circumbinary disk but from circumstellar disk(s ) . source . however , artymowicz & lubow ( 1994 ) points out that a circumbinary disk with typical viscous disk parameters around a binary system with a semi - major axis @xmath55 tends to have an inner truncated radius of 1.8@xmath552.6@xmath55 for the binary eccentricity from 0 to 0.25 .",
    "they also point out that the minimum separation between the component star and the inner circumbinary disk edge is larger than @xmath55 for the binary eccentricity less than 0.75 .",
    "the hd200775 binary orbit has an eccentricity of 0.30@xmath110.06 ( monnier et al .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that 9.5au is larger than the inner edge of the circumbinary system .",
    "it is most likely that the unresolved source emission originates from circumstellar disk(s ) . ]",
    "the surface area of the blackbody emission ( @xmath91arcsec@xmath92 ) indicates a dust ring ( or inner wall ) at 3.7au radius with only a 0.06au width ( or height ) .",
    "lpine & nguyen - quang - rieu ( 1974 ) detected an oh maser line emission at 1667mhz toward hd200775 and concluded that the line profile may be formed in a rotating gaseous disk - shaped envelope within 8 stellar radii .",
    "the detected line emission probably stems from the ionized gas in the dust disk surface or the innermost gas disk where the grains are evaporated .    the diffuse emission at 1.3@xmath9 south from the unresolved source ( fig .",
    "4b ) shows the amorphous silicate feature with a triangular shape .",
    "the peak is located at 9.2@xmath2 m which is largely shifted from the 9.59.8@xmath2 m amorphous silicate peak often seen toward the interstellar medium ( kemper , vriend , & tielens 2004 ) , evolved mass - losing stars ( dorschner et al .",
    "1995 ) , and disks around low to intermediate mass young stars ( honda et al .",
    "it is also shorter than the averaged peak of absorption features of dust grains in outer envelopes of massive protostars and is more compatible with pyroxene ( ( mg , fe)sio@xmath93 ) than olivine ( ( mg , fe)@xmath94sio@xmath95 ) .",
    "we compare the continuum subtracted emission with the normalized emission from amorphous silicate grains at 300k based on jger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( mg@xmath96sio@xmath97 ) and pyroxene ( mgsio@xmath93 ) grains with 0.1 and 1.0@xmath2 m radii . as can be seen in fig .",
    "4b , the peak wavelength decreases as the sio@xmath94 fraction in silicate increases ( koike & hasegawa 1987 ; jger et al .",
    "it suggests the dominance of pyroxene grains or grains with larger sio@xmath94 fraction rather than olivine .",
    "the observed peak wavelength is better matched with mg@xmath96sio@xmath97 grains , but mgsio@xmath93 gives a better fit in the feature width .",
    "there is a report ( tamanai et al .",
    "2007 ) that sio@xmath94 grains of 0.55@xmath2 m diameter have a peak between 8.99.5@xmath2 m .",
    "however , our spectra do not show a feature around 12.5@xmath2 m characteristic to sio@xmath94 .",
    "thus the grains are in form of silicate and not pure sio@xmath94 .",
    "the presence of a 8.9@xmath2 m feature in regions is reported by peeters et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but it seems not to coincide with the observed 9.2@xmath2 m feature .",
    "grain properties very close to massive stars , especially in disks , may be different from those of disks around low mass stars and even their own envelopes .    to understand the characteristic dust properties , the photoevaporation ,",
    "that is , the ionizing flux or ionized gas might be an important factor .",
    "there are many reports of experiments of irradiating ions such as h@xmath98 and he@xmath98 on cosmic grains or model grains .",
    "irradiating crystalline olivine with high energy protons of a few mev , typical of cosmic rays , makes no alteration of the crystalline structure at fluences relevant to the ism ( day 1977 ) .",
    "in contrast , irradiation of h@xmath99 and he@xmath99 ions of a few to several tens kev can amorphize olivine and pyroxene crystals and change the chemical composition of the grains ( bradley 1994 ; dukes et al .",
    "1999 ; demyk et al.2001 ) .",
    "demyk et al .",

    "it caused amorphyzation of olivine in conjunction with an increase in the porosity of the material due to the formation of bubbles .",
    "furthermore , the amorphized layer was deficient in oxygen and magnesium .",
    "they found that the o / si and mg / si ratios decreased as the he@xmath98 fluence increased .",
    "it suggests the change of the olivine to pyroxene structure in the grains .",
    "bradley ( 1994 ) investigated a pyroxene crystal on the surface of an interplanetary dust particle and its rim , where alternation has occurred by the irradiation by solar wind ions .",
    "he found that the rim was stoichiometrically depleted in mg and ca and enriched in s , si , and fe relative to pyroxene .",
    "he also made irradiation experiments of 20kev protons onto a sample of fine - grained matrix from the allende chondritic meteorite .",
    "irradiation of both of olivine and pyroxene crytals in allende again led to the stoichiometric depletion of mg and ca .",
    "he concluded that ion irradiation first striped cations such as mg and ca with the weakest bond strengths and then more strongly bound cations such as si .",
    "these results indicate that irradiation of energetic ions such as h@xmath98 and he@xmath98 causes a change in the lattice structure of grains from olivine to pyroxenes , then to more sio@xmath94 rich structures . since the hd200775 disk is photoevaporating and a stellar wind activity is suggested ( skinner , brown , & stewart 1993 ) , the grains of the hd200775 disk might be alternated by such a mechanism in plasma of the disk surface or by the stellar wind .",
    "further study is required to investigate whether or not the alternation is a common phenomenon in the formation of massive stars .",
    "we have made mid - infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the herbig b3e star hd200775 of @xmath110m@xmath4 with subaru / comics .",
    "we found elongated emission around the unresolved excess emission in all of the 8.8 , 11.7 , 18.8 , and 24.5@xmath2 m bands .",

    "all of these observed characteristics are well explained as the surface emission of the tilted flared circumbinary disk .",
    "the present observations provide the first well - resolved infrared images of a disk around 10m@xmath4 yso and strongly support that hd200775 is formed through the disk accretion . the optical depth and the silicate features of the disk emission support the disk atmosphere configuration , which is well modeled for low to intermediate mass stars .",
    "we fit the observed image with a flared disk model .",
    "the overall observed structure is well explained by the model .",
    "the derived flared geometry is much flatter than the disk around the intermediate mass star hd97048 .",

    "<S> we made mid - infrared observations of the 10m@xmath0 herbig be star hd200775 with the cooled mid - infrared camera and spectrometer ( comics ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered diffuse emission of an elliptical shape extended in the north - south direction in @xmath11000au radius around unresolved excess emission . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse emission is perpendicular to the cavity wall formed by the past outflow activity and is parallel to the projected major axis of the central close binary orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the centers of the ellipse contours of the diffuse emission are shifted from the stellar position and the amount of the shift increases as the contour brightness level decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse emission is well explained in all of geometry ( the shape and the shift ) , size , and configuration by an inclined flared disk where only its surface emits the mid - infrared photons . </S>",
    "<S> our results give the first well - resolved infrared disk images around a massive star and strongly support that hd200775 is formed through the disk accretion . </S>",
    "<S> the disk survives the main accretion phase and shows a structure similar to that around lower - mass stars with disk atmosphere. at the same time , the disk also shows properties characteristic to massive stars such as photoevaporation traced by the 3.4 mm free - free emission and unusual silicate emission with a peak at 9.2@xmath2 m , which is shorter than that of many astronomical objects . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a good place to compare the disk properties between massive and lower - mass stars . </S>"
