    "stellar population studies play a fundamental role in our understanding of stellar evolution , initial mass functions ( imfs ) associated with star cluster formation , and galaxy formation and evolution . with the aim of determining the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of stellar systems of all types ( from star clusters to entire galaxies ) , many techniques have been developed , with varying success , to determine the luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities of nearby and distant stellar systems .",
    "important caveats hinder or limit the application of these techniques ( e.g.  charlot , worthey , & bressan 1996 ; macarthur et  al .",
    "2004 ; anders et  al .  2004 ; tantalo & chiosi 2004 ) .",
    "for example , the determination of ages and metallicities of stellar populations has been plagued by the well - known age / metallicity degeneracy ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "access to both optical _ and _ infrared imaging partially lifts this degeneracy , but broad - band colors suffer further from a degeneracy due to dust reddening ( e.g.  bruzual , magris , & calvet 1988 ; witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ; de  jong 1996 ; bell & de  jong 2000 ; macarthur et  al .",
    "2004 ) , which is particularly problematic in the context of gas rich , star forming systems .",
    "another method of breaking the age / metallicity degeneracy of stellar populations in unresolved systems involves measurement of surface brightness fluctuations ( worthey 1993 ; liu , charlot & graham 2000 ; blakeslee , vazdekis & ajhar 2001 ) , which are most sensitive to contributions from the most luminous stars in the system  typically evolved cool giants .",
    "being sensitive to the second moment of the stellar luminosity function , surface brightness fluctuations provide complementary information to the integrated colors ( the first moment of the stellar luminosity function ) .",
    "this method , however , requires the assumption of a smooth underlying light distribution , and thus is generally only applicable to studies of nearby globular clusters , ellipticals , and spiral bulges .",
    "this broad - band technique is also not applicable to dusty systems ( e.g.  spiral galaxies ) , as the resulting clumpiness will also cause fluctuations in surface brightness and reddening will affect the fluctuation colors .",
    "turning to spectroscopy offers the possibility of overcoming the ambiguities of broad - band color - based analyses by studying the variation of individual line strengths which , if defined over a sufficiently narrow wavelength range , should be insensitive to the effects of dust reddening . in this analysis we test this conjecture by exploring the effects of dust absorption on commonly - used spectroscopic age and metallicity indicators .",
    "in the past three decades , tremendous progress has been made in the modeling of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) ( e.g.  tinsley 1972 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ; worthey 1994 ; vazdekis 1999 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ; maraston 1998 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the current versions provide numerous observables such as high - resolution spectra , magnitudes , colors , mass - to - light ratios , and line - index measurements ( including all those described above ) , for single bursts of star formation ( sf ) with a given imf and metallicity at ages ranging from 020  gyr . in particular ,",
    "the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models include a prescription for dust attenuation ( described in ",
    "[ sec : models ] ) that we adopt for this analysis .",
    "numerous studies of absorption - line indices in the integrated spectra of composite systems have sought to disentangle and constrain the ages and metallicities of their stellar populations ( e.g.  maraston & thomas 2000 ; trager et  al .",
    "2000 ; schiavon et  al .",
    "2002 ; caldwell , rose , & concannon 2003 ) .",
    "the majority of these studies have focused on globular clusters ( gcs ) and elliptical galaxies , where dust is not conspicuous . recently , however , a number of studies have turned their attention to the stellar populations of spiral galaxies , where dust is an ineluctable hindrance ( fisher , franx , & illingworth 1996 ; goudfrooij , gorgas , & jablonka 1999 ; trager , dalcanton , & weiner 1999 ; proctor & samson 2002 ; bergmann , jrgensen , & hill 2003 ; kauffmann et  al .",
    "2003a ; falc ' on - barroso et  al .",
    "2003 ) . reddening by dust has often been assumed to have a negligible effect on on line indices , but no rigorous study has yet been performed to verify this conjecture .",
    "this work presents the first such analysis .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows ; a description of the line - indices studied and their applicability as age and metallicity discriminators is given in ",
    "[ sec : indices ] .",
    "the stellar population synthesis models and dust prescription are described in ",
    "[ sec : models ] . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss the dust sensitivities of the lick & higher - order balmer line indices , the 4000   break , the triplet indices , and the rose indices , and the results are summarized in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ sec : fits ] , we present age and metallicity fits to the model galaxies in several index  index planes and discuss the errors on the derived physical parameters due to dust extinction .",
    "the lick / ids system of 21 spectral line indices was designed to calibrate the strength of fundamental spectral features in stars and composite systems ( e.g.  gorgas et  al .",
    "the indices measure the strength of a particular spectral feature ( either atomic and defined as an equivalent width in  , or molecular and measured in magnitudes ) relative to a pseudo - continuum on each side of the feature .",
    "the most reliable indices have been calibrated as a function of stellar color ( effective temperature ) , surface gravity , and metallicity ( gorgas et  al .  1993 ; worthey et  al .",
    "1994 ) allowing for the construction of semi - empirical population models ( e.g.  worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the lick indices are sensitive to the metallicity and age of stellar populations to varying degrees . when compared with population models , diagnostic plots of age versus metallicity sensitive indices , such as h@xmath0 versus mg_b _ or @xmath1fe@xmath2 , help break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "however , measurements of many of the lick indices are quite sensitive to spectral resolution and , thus , to the velocity dispersion of the system ( gonz ' alez 1993 ; trager et  al .  1998 ; proctor & sansom 2002 ) , and their use requires relatively high signal - to - noise data ( s / n @xmath3 50/ ; see cardiel et  al .",
    "in addition , certain indices , h@xmath0 in particular , can suffer `` in - filling '' from nebular emission contamination , present even in early - type galaxies ( gonz ' alez 1993 ; dezeeuw et  al .",
    "2002 ; caldwell , rose , & concannon 2003 ) .      in order to overcome the problem of nebular emission fill in of the h@xmath0 feature , worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ; hereafter wo97 ) introduced two pairs of indices that measure the higher - order balmer lines h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 .",
    "two definitions for each feature were defined , the narrower version ( @xmath6 20  ) is denoted with the subscript `` f '' ( as it encompasses all of the balmer line absorption from stars of spectral type f at the lick / ids resolution of 810  ) , e.g.  h@xmath7 , and the wider definition ( @xmath6 40  ) has the subscript `` a '' ( as it includes all of the absorption from a stars ) , e.g.  h@xmath8 . the narrow indices are more age - sensitive , but require higher s / n and resolution . while their age - sensitivity is not as strong as for h@xmath0 , the higher - order balmer lines are much less affected by emission from ionized gases ( e.g.  osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "thus , when combined with a metallicity sensitive index , the wo97 indices provide a more reliable age estimate for star - forming galaxies .",
    "note , however , that the wo97 higher - order balmer lines are poorly calibrated ( vazdekis 1999 ) , likely due to the degrading resolution at the blue end of the ids data .      another widely used spectral index that obviates the need for high s / n and spectral resolution is the 4000   break , a flux ratio that brackets the strongest discontinuity in the optical spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "the break arises due to the accumulation of a large number of spectral lines in a narrow wavelength region bluewards of 4000   in stellar types cooler than g0 ( bruzual 1983 ; gorgas et  al .",
    "the main contribution to the @xmath9 4000   opacity comes from atomic metals ( , , ) and molecular cn , which decreases for hotter and more metal poor stars .",
    "thus the 4000   break is weak for young and/or metal - poor stellar populations and strong for old , metal - rich galaxies ( kauffmann et  al .",
    "2003a ) . in its original form , ( bruzual 1983 ) ,",
    "the 4000   break , denoted d(4000 ) , was defined as the ratio of the average fluxes per frequency unit measured over the spectral ranges 40504250   and 37503950  .",
    "cardiel et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) demonstrated that this discontinuity can be measured with a relative error of @xmath10% with a s / n per   @xmath11 , thus making it better suited for lower quality data .",
    "however , the d(4000 ) does have a few drawbacks due to its long baseline .",
    "these were partially alleviated with the introduction of a narrower definition ( balogh et  al .",
    "1999 ) denoted d@xmath12(4000 )   and measured over the ranges 40004100   and 38503950  .",
    "the narrow definition was designed to exploit two principal advantages : an improved agreement between multiple measurements of a given galaxy , and a weaker sensitivity to reddening effects . however , using their narrow d@xmath12(4000 )  index , balogh et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) still had to invoke dust reddening as a cause for the large d@xmath12(4000 )  values in a number of their @xmath13 galaxies , i.e.  d@xmath12(4000 )  is not impervious to dust effects . nevertheless , often found in the literature is the statement that the d@xmath12(4000 )  is _ insensitive _ to dust attenuation effects .",
    "for example , kauffmann et  al .",
    "( 2003b ) use the amplitude of the d@xmath12(4000 )  in combination with the strength of the h@xmath14 index of wo97 as diagnostics for the sfh of the host galaxies , from which they infer the dust attenuation by comparing observed to model colors , a method that relies heavily on the assumption of dust insensitivity of the d@xmath12(4000 )  and h@xmath14 indices .",
    "there has been a great effort recently to extend stellar population studies to the near - ir region , focusing on the triplet as one of the most prominent features in the near - ir spectrum of cool stars ( from spectral types of about f5 to m2 ) ( cenarro et  al .",
    "2001a , b ; vazdekis et  al .",
    "three `` lick - style '' indices designed to measure the strengths of the triplet lines ( @xmath158498.02 , 8542.09 , 8662.14  ) , and denoted ca1 , ca2 , and ca3 , have been defined and redefined by several authors ( e.g.  jones , alloin , & jones 1984 ; armandroff & zinn 1988 ; diaz , terlevich , & terlevich 1989 , hereafter dtt ; delisle & hardy 1992 ) . however , measurement of a reliable continuum for these indices is difficult due to the strong and crowded absorption features in the vicinity of the lines ( largely from , , and tio ) , as well as significant blending with the hydrogen paschen series whose absorption is present in stars of types g3 and hotter .    to overcome these problems , cenarro et  al .",
    "( 2001a ) defined a new set of triplet indices specifically designed for measurement in integrated galactic spectra .",
    "the new definitions are categorized as `` generic '' indices , which have advantages over the classical `` lick - style '' indices when looking at adjacent absorption lines in regions where the continuum is crowded with spectral features .",
    "their cat index includes the strenghts of all three lines and uses a combination of 5 continuum bandpasses ( see cenarro et  al .",
    "2001a for details on the measurement of generic indices ) .",
    "additionally , they define the generic index pat , which measures the strength of three of the h paschen series lines that are free from ca contamination .",
    "finally , the index cat * is designed to remove the h paschen line contamination from cat making it a reliable indicator of the pure triplet strength .",
    "the index is given by cat * = cat - 0.93 pat .",
    "vazdekis et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) discuss the behavior of these features for ssps as predicted by recent evolutionary synthesis models . in the current analysis",
    "we also explore the dust sensitivity of the three classical triplet indices , as defined in dtt , and the generic indices of cenarro et  al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the optical rose ( 1984 , 1985 ) indices were developed in part to overcome the difficulties in identifying the continuum in crowded spectral regions .",
    "the rose indices maximize the contribution of a given feature by using a measurement of the ratio of its central line intensity to that of a close reference line , without recourse to the ( pseudo- ) continuum level .",
    "information about equivalent widths is however lost in such relative measurements , and the rose indices are not ideal for separating age and metallicity effects .",
    "nonetheless , some of the rose indices are quite sensitive to metallicity ( see vazdekis 1999 ) and , in combination with a sensitive age indicator ( e.g.  h@xmath0 ) , could help disentangle the two effects .",
    "the rose indices also provide a unique and sensitive test for the presence of early - type stars ( i.e.  a post - starburst , and potentially dusty , population ) in an integrated spectrum as well as a probe of the relative contribution of dwarf and evolved ( red giant branch ) stars to the integrated spectrum of a galaxy ( caldwell , rose , & concannon 2003 ) . as with the lick indices",
    ", it is usually assumed that the rose indices are insensitive to dust reddening ( e.g.  leonardi & worthey 2000 ) , an assumption we examine in this study .",
    "finally , we also investigate dust effects on the pseudo - equivalent width , `` lick - style '' , indices of rose ( 1994 ) and jones & worthey ( 1995 ) which have extremely narrow definitions ( and are denoted with the subscript `` hr '' ) .",
    "the h@xmath16 index has been identified as one of the most sensitive age distriminators ( jones & worthey 1995 ) , but these narrow features suffer a worse resolution sensitivity than the wo97 indices and thus can only be used with high quality data of low velocity - dispersion systems .",
    "vazdekis & arimoto ( 1999 ) and vazdekis et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) confronted the velocity dispersion sensitivity of these narrow indices by defining a set of four h@xmath4 indices that take resolution effects into account , allowing for reliable measurements in galaxies with velocity dispersions up to @xmath17 .",
    "note , however , that the vazdekis & arimoto ( 1999 ) indices require",
    "s / n @xmath18 200400/  and have strong error covariances due to overlapping pseudo - continuum and central bandpasses , making them much harder to measure than the wo97 indices .",
    "the response of these indices to dust extinction is similar to the wo97 h@xmath19 and the jones & worthey ( 1995 ) h@xmath16 indices , so the results are not shown .",
    "the stellar population synthesis models used for this analysis are those of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; hereafter galaxev ) .",
    "the high resolution models using the padova evolutionary tracks ( bertelli et  al .",
    "1994 ) and the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf were adopted .",
    "these models include ssp spectra in the wavelength range 32009500   with a resolution of 3  , metallicities ranging from @xmath20 0.00010.05 ( or 0.0052.5 times z@xmath21 ) , and ages ranging from 020  gyr ( in 220 unequally - spaced time steps ) . for each time step ,",
    "a number of integrated quantities are provided such as magnitudes and colors in many different filter systems , line - index strengths for all definitions in the lick / ids system , wo97 , the two definitions of the 4000  break , and the dtt indices .",
    "the line strengths used here are computed directly from the high - resolution model spectra , i.e.  the spectra have not been transformed to the lick / ids system ( see e.g.  wo97 ) .",
    "the rose , , and `` hr '' spectral indices , which are not provided with the bc03 model outputs , were computed with a public ` fortran ` program by a. vazdekis .",
    "the galaxev distribution allows for the computation of attenuation effects due to dust according to the two - component model of charlot & fall ( 2000 ; hereafter cf00 ) .",
    "the two adjustable parameters of this model are @xmath22@xmath23 , the total effective @xmath24-band optical depth affecting stars younger than 10@xmath25 yr , and @xmath26 , the fraction of the total dust absorption contributed by diffuse interstellar medium ( cirrus ) dust .",
    "that is , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the age of any single stellar generation .",
    "this model has the singular feature of accounting for the finite lifetime ( @xmath29 yr ) of stellar birth clouds .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve ( proportional to @xmath30 ) was constrained to reproduce the observed relation between the ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities , and the ultraviolet spectral slope of their starburst galaxies ( see also the grasil models of silva et  al .",
    "note that @xmath22@xmath31 on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : dust ] ) is a function of time and @xmath26 . as a result , even if @xmath32 ( no cirrus dust component ) ,",
    "in the presence of young stellar populations ( @xmath33 yr ) , dust will still contribute some extinction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ebmv ] ) .",
    "note that in the adopted dust model of cf00 , the model spectra are representative of the total integrated light of a galaxy , i.e. , neither radial nor inclination dependent information is available .",
    "other prescriptions for dust attenuation in galaxies exist ( e.g.  witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ; byun , freeman , & kylafis 1994 ; de  jong 1996 ; gordon et  al .",
    "2001 ) , a few of which have been coupled with spectral synthesis and photo - ionization codes .",
    "for example , moy et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) interfaced the pgase population synthesis models of fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) with the cloudy photo - ionization code of ferland ( 2002 ) .",
    "these models include a treatment for dust attenuation processes , but do not consider nebular emission .",
    "they also adopt a simple screen approximation for the dust distribution , an unrealistic geometry for galaxies .",
    "similarly , panuzzo et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) coupled the same cloudy code with their spectrophotometric synthesis model grasil ( silva et  al .",
    "1998 ) , to yield a complete treatment of dust reprocessing with more realistic geometries and account for the age dependence of molecular birth clouds ( as in cf00 ) . while these models may be more realistic and provide directional information that is lacking in the cf00 models , the resolution of the output from these models is not sufficient for accurate line - index measurements .",
    "future implementations of these models may allow for a comparative analysis , but at present , the cf00 dust models , coupled with the bc03 sps models , provide ( to the best of our knowledge ) the only suitable output for the current study .        in a study of 705 non - seyfert galaxies drawn from the stromlo - apm redshift survey ( loveday et  al .",

    "[ fig : expsfh ] we show the index responses to dust for an exponential sfh with @xmath50  gyr , which is reasonably close to a constant sf rate so there is a significant amount of `` current '' sf at each of the three epochs considered .",
    "models with current sf yield considerably different results than the ssps , as seen in figure  [ fig : expsfh ] .",
    "almost all of the lick indices show sensitivity to dust , some more so at young ages ( e.g.  cn@xmath67 , cn@xmath68 , h@xmath0 , and all four wo97 indices ) , others more so at older ages ( e.g.  ca4227 , fe4531 , fe4668 , mg_b _ , and nad ) , and some show differences of equal magnitude , but in opposite directions at old and young ages ( e.g.  g4300 , fe4383 , and the molecular mg indices ) .",
    "the situation is undoubtedly complex and can be attributed to the fact that , with current sf occurring at all epochs , there is a significant and non - linear amount of extinction of the hottest , youngest stars which contribute considerably to the total optical flux . as such , dust effects",
    "are often stronger for models with smaller @xmath26 and these effects saturate at optical depths above about @xmath22@xmath77 ( at which the birth clouds become completely optically thick ) .",
    "the situation for mixed stellar populations with significant amounts of current sf is clearly complicated and not easily prescribed .",
    "however , for many of the indices ( e.g.  ca4227 , ca4455 , fe5406 , fe5709 , fe5782 , nad , tio@xmath67 , and tio@xmath68 ) , the magnitude of the dust effects is never close to that of current typical measurement errors , and thus would not be detected . unfortunately , however , the most often used indices ( e.g.  h@xmath0 , mg_b _ , the composite indices @xmath1fe@xmath2  and [ mgfe]@xmath72 , and the wo97 indices ) are also the most seriously affected .",
    "it is useful to take a closer look at the cause for the erratic behavior in some of the indices in response to the dust extinction . in figure",

    "the index red and blue pseudo - continuum band limits are marked by the green dashed vertical lines and the central band by the solid vertical lines .",

    "there is very little effect in the ssp index measurement , the change in slope of the sed is matched by the change in slope of the pseudo - continuum .",
    "however , for the exponential sfh at 0.5 gyr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hbeta_both ] [ top right panel ] ) , the continuum is increased relative to the depth of the absorption - line in the dust extincted models . this can be understood by recognizing that the young ob stars that suffer significant extinction have lower h@xmath0 values .",
    "thus , by hiding these low h@xmath0 index stars , the index is effectively increased .",
    "in fact , this is the case for all of the balmer lines , hence all of the balmer - line indices show similar behavior .",
    "this also highlights a major limitation when using balmer - line indices in determining young ages ( @xmath78 gyr ) .",
    "the models become degenerate in age here because there are two possible ages that can be inferred at these balmer index values , i.e.the balmer indices are double - valued in the region of young stellar population ages . this point and its resulting limitations",
    "are further emphasized in appendix  [ sec : fits ] .    for the molecular indices , which have much broader baselines and crowding of spectral lines in their passband regions , the situation can be more complicated .",

    "the color codes , line - types , and sfhs are the same as in figure  [ fig : hbeta_both ] . in this case ,",

    "the narrower index is certainly less affected by dust ( note the different y - axis scales ) , but it is by no means impervious to dust reddening effects , and can reach deviations with magnitudes much larger than the typical error for this index .",
    "dust effects are smaller at younger ages , but they can be significant at all ages for realistic values of @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the influence of these dust effects on the determination of ages and metallicities is deferred to appendix [ sec : fits ] .",

    "we are not interested here in a detailed comparison of the different sps models , but rather seek a quantitative guide for the magnitude of the errors due to dust effects on the physical parameters derived from absorption - line indices . to this end , we use the 2003 implementation of the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) sps models ( galaex ) for the age and metallicity determinations , the same as are used to compute the model `` galaxies '' ( see  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "while most galaxies have likely undergone sfhs that are much more complex than the simple ssp described above , the common practice for line - index measurements is to compute `` ssp - ages and metallicities '' , that is , compare the galaxy indices to the ssp grids , irrespective of the true sfh of the galaxy ( which is unknown ) .",
    "we adopt this technique here and thus refer to ssp parameters even for the models with exponential sfhs .",
    "ages and metallicities are determined by fitting the model galaxy index measurements to the ssp model grids using a maximum - likelihood approach .",
    "we retain the same grid in time as is provided in the model ssps ( 220 unequally spaced time steps from @xmath28 = 020 gyr ) and interpolate ( linearly ) between the model metallicities on a fine grid of 120 unequally spaced steps in @xmath94 . in order to compare all indices on a similar scale , the atomic indices computed as equivalent widths in  , @xmath95 , are converted to a magnitude , @xmath96 , as :                where @xmath103 is the number of indices ( only 2 are used here , but this method could be generalized to fit multiple indices simultaneously ) , @xmath104 is the `` observed '' value ( in magnitudes ) of index @xmath105 and @xmath106 is its error in magnitudes , and @xmath107 is the ssp model value of index @xmath105 for a given age and metallicity combination .",
    "errors for the individual age and metallicity measurements are estimated using a monte carlo approach .",
    "one thousand realizations of the model fits are computed using errors drawn from a normal distribution of the observational errors ( taken here as the `` typical '' observation errors for each index quoted in  [ sec : lick ] ) .",
    "the errors for the measured ages and metallicities are taken as half the interval containing 68% of the 1000 monte carlo realizations ( i.e.  the 1@xmath93 confidence interval ) .",
    "two examples of the fits are given in figure  [ fig : montecarlo ] which shows the logarithmic difference between the physical parameters derived from each simulated point relative to the best - fit value for the d@xmath12(4000 )   fe4668 plane ( see also the corresponding index  index plot in figure  [ fig : indexgrids ] [ right panel ] ) .",
    "the left panel presents the fit for the dust - free ( @xmath108 ) ssp case which indeed finds the correct model age ( a = 5 gyr ; @xmath109[age ( gyr ) ] = 0 ) and metallicity ( z = 0.02 ; @xmath110 = 0 $ ] ) , with corresponding 1@xmath93 confidence intervals ( represented as error bars ) of @xmath62 0.2 dex for both parameters .",
    "the right panel presents the fit for the dusty case ( @xmath111 ) at 0.5 gyr ( but note the different y - axis scales ) .",
    "the @xmath22@xmath112 fit finds the correct physical parameters , but as the dust opacity increases , the best fit wanders around in age ( from a = 0.5 gyr at @xmath22@xmath112 to a = 10.0 gyr at @xmath22@xmath113 ) and metallicity ( from @xmath94 = 0.02 at @xmath22@xmath112 to @xmath94 = 0.003 at @xmath22@xmath113 ) .",
    "since we do not consider extrapolations , there are `` edges '' in these plots that represent the limits of the model grids . as a result",

    "given that we are comparing model galaxies with exponential sfhs against ssp grids , it is inevitable that some of the parameter space will fall outside the model grids and thus can not be fit reliably .",

    "reliable fits are indicated with a check mark , . for unreliable fits",
    "the check mark is replaced with a code indicating the reason for which they could not be fit .",
    "the codes are : `` og '' if the point lies off the model grids , `` db '' if it lies in the young double - valued balmer line region , and `` dm '' if it lies in a degenerate metallicity region ( only occurred for the young exponential sfh model in the d@xmath12(4000 )   fe4668 plane ) .",
    "note that , in the absence of a reliable fit for the dust - free case , even if reliable fits exist for the corresponding dusty models , the @xmath91 s are not well defined ( only occurred for the 0.5 gyr exponential sfh model in table  [ tab : errs_exp ] in the d@xmath12(4000 )   fe4668 plane ) .",
    "examples of the messy double - valued balmer line region can be seen in the h@xmath0 versus mg_b _ plot in figure  [ fig : indexgrids ] [ left panel ] where the ages plotted extend down to 0.002 gyr , as well as in figures  [ fig : hb_fe ] & [ fig : hdela_d4000 ] in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "it is obvious from tables  [ tab : errs_ssp ] & [ tab : errs_exp ] ( and see fig .",
    "[ fig : montecarlo ] ) that there is significant uncertainty in the fits given our assumed `` typical '' measurement errors , regardless of the dust content .",
    "for example , the 0.5 gyr ssp model 1@xmath93 confidence limits ( table  [ tab : errs_ssp ] ) range from @xmath620.10.4 gyr in age and @xmath620.20.3 dex in metallicity , depending on the index  index grid used .",
    "note that the 1@xmath93 confidence limits are not only dependent on the particular index - index plane used , but they also depend on the location of the point within the grid ( in other words , to what degree the age and metallicity are separated at the given locus ) . in general ,",
    "the degeneracies become more severe at the extreme metallicities ( i.e.  @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) , and at young ages , where both the narrower region covered by the metallicity span and the double - valued balmer lines contribute to the problem .    as expected from ",
    "[ sec : results ] , the fits for the 0.5 gyr ssp models ( table  [ tab : errs_ssp ] ) are virtually unaffected by dust ( for the index  index planes shown ) , with the exception of the d@xmath12(4000 )   fe4668 plane , for which the age and metallicity errors are large ( up to 9.5 gyr and 0.8 dex respectively ) and significant compared to the 1@xmath93 confidence limits , even for small amounts of dust .",
    "significant errors occur at the highest dust opacities for the 5 gyr models ( in all but the h@xmath0 ",
    "mg_b _ and [ mgfe]@xmath72 planes ) , but in this case they are of the same order as the 1@xmath93 confidence limits .",
    "the errors due to dust on age and metallicity are most severe in the 13 gyr models , with some points ending up off the model grids at the highest @xmath22@xmath23 s ( e.g.  in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath14 versus fe4668 grids ) , but these are again matched by the large 1@xmath93 confidence limits for fits in these regions of the grid . in summary , for the ssp model galaxies , if the model indices lie in a region of the index  index diagnostic plot where the age and metallicity are well separated ( close to orthogonal ) , the fits are generally independant of dust extinction for most index combinations",
    ". where the fits are affected by the dust ( generally at older ages and for indices with broader baselines ) , the errors in the derived ages and metallicities are generally of the same order as the 1@xmath93 confidence limits and would thus be difficult to detect .",
    "the most notable exceptions here are the h@xmath0mg@xmath120 plane , where the dust pushes the points for the 0.5 gyr models into the degenerate double - valued balmer line region , and the d@xmath12(4000 )   fe4668 plane , where the errors due to dust become large at young ages , and at old ages the points extend off the edges of the model grids .",
    "on the other hand , for the exponential sfh models , again as expected from  [ sec : results ] , the situation is more complicated .",
    "examination of table  [ tab : errs_exp ] reveals that none of the 0.5 gyr models can be fit reliably in the balmer - index versus metallicity - index grids as they all fall in the double - valued balmer line region of the plots .",
    "reliable fits for the dustier 0.5 gyr models in the d@xmath12(4000 )   fe4668 plane are obtained , but here the @xmath91 s are undefined due to the poor fit in the dust - free model .",
    "reliable fits are found for most of the 5 gyr exponential sfh models with `` ssp ages '' in the range @xmath620.91.0 gyr ( i.e.  this is the luminosity - weighted ssp age of a 5 gyr old stellar population that has been forming stars at a constant rate , roughly , throughout its lifetime ) .",
    "the ages , when reliably fit , generally agree between the different index  index plane fits .",
    "when dust has an effect on the ages , it tends to make them slightly youger , but the @xmath91a s are always of the same order as the 1@xmath93 confidence limits for the fits .",
    "the metallicity fits for these models , which are all inherently solar metallicity , are in the range @xmath121 to @xmath122 ( or @xmath94 = 0.004  0.03 ) .",
    "they are generally lower(higher ) than solar in the 5 ( 13 ) gyr models and increase with dust extinction . unlike the age fits , the metallicity fits do not agree very well between the different index  index planes .",
    "for example , the @xmath22@xmath123 fit in 13 gyr models gives @xmath115 = + 0.32 and @xmath920.12 dex in the h@xmath0 ",
    "mg_b _ and h@xmath0  fe4668 planes respectively .",
    "the ages for the 13 gyr exponential sfh model fits are also in the @xmath620.91.0 gyr range .",
    "while these do have weaker balmer lines than the 5 gyr models , their metallicity index values are slightly stronger .",
    "this has the overall effect of moving them along a line of roughly constant age .",
    "an example of this is shown by the 5 gyr ( green ) and 13 gyr ( blue ) triangles in the h@xmath0 versus mg_b _ diagnostic plot in figure  [ fig : indexgrids ] [ left panel ] .",
    "these results highlight once again the greater challenge of fitting reliable ages and metallicities for `` young '' populations .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of dust extinction on integrated absorption - line indices that are widely used to derive constraints on the ages and metallicities of composite stellar systems . </S>",
    "<S> typically , absorption - line studies have been performed on globular clusters or elliptical galaxies , which are mostly dust - free systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , many recent studies of integrated stellar populations have focused on spiral galaxies which may contain significant amounts of dust . </S>",
    "<S> it is almost universally assumed that the effects of dust extinction on absorption - line measurements are entirely negligible given the narrow baseline of the spectral features , but no rigorous study has yet been performed to verify this conjecture . in this analysis , we explore the sensitivity of the standard set of lick absorption - line indices , the higher - order balmer line indices , the 4000   break , the near - ir calcium triplet indices , and the rose indices to dust absorption according to population synthesis models that incorporate a multi - component model for the line and continuum attenuation due to dust . </S>",
    "<S> the latter takes into account the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds . </S>",
    "<S> while dust does not greatly affect the line - index measurements for single stellar populations , its effect can be significant for the 4000   break or when there is a significant amount of current star formation . </S>"
