    "statistical and dynamical properties of polymers with nontrivial topology such as ring polymers have attracted much interest in several branches of physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "for instance , some fundamental properties of ring polymers in solution were studied many years ago@xcite circular dna have been found in nature in the 1960s and knotted dna molecules are synthesized in experiments in the 1980s ; @xcite looped or knotted proteins have been found in nature during the 2000s.@xcite there are many theoretical studies on knotted ring polymers in solution .",
    "@xcite due to novel developments in synthetic chemistry , polymers with different topological structures are synthesized in experiments during the last decade such as not only ring polymers but also tadpole ( or lasso ) polymers , double - ring ( or di - cyclic ) polymers and even complete bipartite graph polymers .",
    "@xcite lasso polymers are studied also in the dynamics of protein folding .",
    "@xcite we call polymers with nontrivial topology _ topological polymers_. @xcite in order to characterize topological polymers it is fundamental to study the statistical and dynamical properties such as the mean - square radius of gyration and the diffusion coefficient .",
    "they are related to experimental results such as the size exclusion chromatography ( sec ) spectrum . for multiple - ring ( or multi - cyclic )",
    "polymers hydrodynamic properties are studied theoretically by a perturbative method .",
    "@xcite for double - ring polymers they are studied by the monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation of self - avoiding double - polygons.@xcite    the purpose of the present research is to study fundamental aspects of the statistical and dynamical properties of various topological polymers in solution such as the mean - square radius of gyration and the diffusion coefficient systematically through simulation .",
    "we numerically evaluate them for two different models of topological polymers : ideal topological polymers which have no excluded volume and real topological polymers which have excluded volume , and show how they depend on the topology of the polymers . here",
    ", the topological structures of topological polymers are expressed in terms of spatial graphs .",
    "furthermore , we show that the short - range intrachain correlation is much enhanced for real topological polymers with complex graphs .",
    "we numerically investigate fundamental properties of topological polymers in the following procedures .",
    "firstly , we construct a weighted ensemble of ideal topological polymers by an algorithm which is based on some properties of quaternions .",
    "@xcite by the algorithm we generate @xmath0-step random walks connecting any given two points , @xcite where the computational time is linearly proportional to the step number @xmath0 in spite of the nontrivial constraints on the sub - chains of the graphs .",
    "we evaluate the statistical average of some physical quantities over the weighted ensemble .",
    "secondly , we construct an ensemble of conformations of real topological polymers by performing the molecular dynamics of the kremer - grest model and evaluate the statistical average of the quantities over the ensemble .",
    "thirdly , by comparing the results of the real topological polymers with those of the ideal ones , we numerically show that for the mean - square radius of gyration @xmath1 and the hydrodynamic radius @xmath2 the set of ratios of the quantities among different topological polymers is given by almost the same for ideal and real topological polymers if the valency of each vertex is equal to or less than three in the graphs , as far as for the polymers we have investigated .",
    "it agrees with tezuka s observation that the sec results are not affected by the excluded volume if each vertex of a topological polymer has less than or equal to three connecting bonds .",
    "@xcite here we evaluate the hydrodynamic radius @xmath2 through kirkwood s approximation .",
    "@xcite    it thus follows that the quaternion method for generating ideal topological polymers is practically quite useful for evaluating physical quantities .",
    "in fact , we can estimate at least approximately the values of @xmath1 or @xmath3 for real topological polymers by making use of the ratios among the corresponding ideal ones , if the valency of vertices is limited up to three .",
    "moreover , we show that the ratio of the gyration radius to the hydrodynamic radius of a topological polymer , @xmath4 , is characteristic to the topology of the polymer . here , the gyration radius @xmath5 is given by the square root of the mean - square radius of gyration .",
    "we remark that the quaternion method has been generalized to a fast algorithm for generating equilateral random polygons through symplectic geometry .",
    "@xcite    we analytically show that the ratio of the gyration radius to the hydrodynamic radius of a topological polymer , @xmath4 , is characterized by the variance of the probability distribution function of the distance between two segments of the polymer .",
    "in particular , we argue that the ratio decreases if the variance becomes small . here",
    "we call the function the distance distribution function , briefly .",
    "it is expressed with the pair distribution function , or the radial distribution function of polymer segments . the mean - square radius of gyration @xmath1 and the hydrodynamic radius @xmath3 correspond to the second moment and the inverse moment of the distance distribution function , respectively .",
    "we numerically evaluate the distance distribution function of a topological polymer both for the ideal and real chain models .",
    "for the ideal chain model , the numerical plots of the distance distribution function are approximated well by fitted curves of a simple formula .",
    "they lead to the numerical estimates of the mean - square radius of gyration and the hydrodynamic radius consistent with those evaluated directly from the chain conformations . in the case of ideal ring polymers",
    ", we exactly derive an analytic expression of the pair distribution function , which is consistent with the fitting formula .    for real topological polymers",
    "we show that the short - distance intrachain correlation of a topological polymer is much enhanced , i.e. the correlation hole becomes large , if the graph is complex .",
    "the exponent of the short - range power - law behavior in the distance distribution function is given by 0.7 for a linear polymer and a ring polymer , while it is given by larger values such as 0.9 and 1.15 for a @xmath6-shaped polymer and a complete bipartite graph @xmath7 polymer , respectively .",
    "we suggest that the estimate to the exponent of the short - distance correlation such as 0.7 for linear and ring chains is consistent with the estimate of exponent @xmath8 of the short - range correlation in a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) derived by des cloizeaux with the renormalization group ( rg ) arguments , @xcite as will be shown shortly . here",
    "we remark that the estimate of @xmath8 has been confirmed in the mc simulation of saw .",

    "it was shown that the large - distance asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 for @xmath11 is given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 does not change exponentially fast for large @xmath15 , while the short - distance behavior is given by @xmath16 with the exponent given by @xmath17 through asymptotic analysis @xcite and @xmath18 through the rg arguments .",

    "then , we define critical exponents @xmath21 for @xmath22 as follows .",
    "assuming @xmath23 we have @xmath24 the rg estimates of the exponents for @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "@xcite they are close to the mc estimates such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "@xcite thus , these estimates of @xmath8 are in agreement with the value 0.7 of the exponent for the short - range power - law behavior of the distance distribution functions of real linear and real ring polymers within errors .",
    "here we remark that most of the pairs of segments in a saw are given by those between middle points .",
    "the contents of the paper consist of the following . in section 2",
    "we introduce the notation of graphs expressing topological polymers .",
    "we explain the quaternion algorithm for generating topological polymers with given graph , and then the kremer - grest model of molecular dynamics and give estimates of the relaxation time . in section 3 we present the data of the mean - square radius of gyration and the hydrodynamic radius both for ideal and real topological polymers .",
    "we numerically show that the ratios of the mean - square radius of gyration among such topological polymers having up to trivalent vertices are given by the same values both for ideal and real topological polymers .",
    "we also evaluate the ratio of the gyration radius to the hydrodynamic radius .",
    "we argue that the ratio of the root mean - square radius of gyration to the hydrodynamic radius for a topological polymer decreases if the variance of the distance distribution function decreases . in section 4",
