    "<S> the diffractive vector meson photoproduction with hadron dissociation in coherent hadron - hadron interactions at lhc energies is studied assuming that the color singlet @xmath0-channel exchange carries large momentum transfer . </S>",

    "<S> the typical examples of processes that can be studied in these coherent hadron - hadron collisions are the exclusive vector meson production and the inclusive heavy quark production , described by the reactions @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , respectively . as shown e.g. in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the study of these processes could valuable information on qcd dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have extended the previous studies for the diffractive @xmath9 photoproduction with hadron dissociation in the case of large momentum transfer @xcite ( for related studies see ref . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0-channel color singlet carries large momentum transfer , which means that the square of the four momentum transferred across the associated rapidity gap , -@xmath0 , is large . differently from the diffractive processes studied in refs </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which are characterized by two rapidity gaps with the two hadrons remaining intact , now we still have two large rapidity gaps in the detector but one of the hadrons dissociates . </S>",
    "<S> one expects a rapidity gap between the hadron , which emits the photon and remains intact , and the vector meson . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the other gap , we expect a vector meson on one side and a jet on the other , which balances the transverse momentum . </S>",

    "<S> the struck parton initiates a jet and carries a fraction @xmath37 of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming hadron , which is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the mass of the products of the target dissociation and @xmath40 is the mass of the target . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite we calculate @xmath32 for the process @xmath41 by integrating eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dsigdtdx ] ) over @xmath37 in the region @xmath42 . the differential cross - section for the @xmath43 process can be expressed as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the mass of the vector meson , @xmath48 is the photon virtuality and @xmath49 is a characteristic scale related to @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we only consider @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the bfkl amplitude @xmath53 , in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) and lowest conformal spin ( @xmath54 ) , is given by  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the momentum transferred , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is proportional to the bfkl kernel eigenvalues  @xcite with @xmath59 being the digamma function . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given in terms of the bfkl eigenfunctions and impact factors , which describe in the high energy limit the couplings of the external particle pair to the color singlet gluonic ladder ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that in lla , @xmath62 is arbitrary ( but must depend on the scale in the problem , see discussion below ) and @xmath63 is a constant .    let us start the analysis of our results discussing the diffractive @xmath10 photoproduction in @xmath64 collisions at hera . in particular , it is important clarify our choice for the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling appears in two pieces of the calculations : in the impact factors , coming from their couplings to the two gluons , and in the definition of the variable @xmath67 , being generated by the gluon coupling inside the gluon ladder ( for details see ref.@xcite ) . as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we will treat these strong couplings as being identical and we will assume a fixed @xmath65 , which is appropriate to the leading logarithmic accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as the cross section is proportional to @xmath68 , our results are strongly dependent on the choice of @xmath65 . following refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we assume @xmath69 , with this valued determined from a fit to the hera data ( for a detailed discussion see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . similarly , in the lla </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath66 is arbitrary but must depend on the scale in the problem . in our case </S>",
    "<S> we have that in general @xmath66 will be a function of @xmath70 and/or @xmath0 . following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we assume that @xmath66 can be expressed by @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 being free parameters to be fitted by data . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we compare our predictions for the differential cross section for @xmath10 production with the hera data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the curves were obtained using the cteq6l parton distributions @xcite and considering distinct values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 . a very good agreement with the data </S>",
    "<S> is obtained for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are the values that we will use in our calculations for @xmath10 production .    </S>",
    "<S> having fixed the free parameters , let us now calculate the rapidity distribution and total cross sections for diffractive @xmath10 photoproduction in coherent hadron - hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution in rapidity @xmath16 of the produced final state can be directly computed from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dsigdydt ] ) , by integrating over the squared transverse momentum and using the corresponding photon spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> as the total cross section for diffractive @xmath9 photoproduction was measured in hera for different @xmath0-ranges , we consider three different choices for the limits of integration in the squared momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> basically , we assume the same values used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which define the ranges studied in hera . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is directly associated to the fact that the associated @xmath11 data are quite well described by our formalism ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we integrate over @xmath37 in the range @xmath76 , which means that we assume that the upper limit on the mass of the target dissociation products at lhc is similar to that considered at hera . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we present our results for the rapidity distribution considering @xmath77 collisions at @xmath78 tev and @xmath28 collisions at @xmath79 tev , respectively . as expected from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the rapidity distribution decreases when we select a range with larger values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the main differences between our predictions for @xmath77 and @xmath28 collisions are the order of magnitude of the cross sections , which is larger in nuclear collisions due to the higher photon flux ( see below ) , and the prediction of a plateau in the range @xmath80 in the nuclear case , which is directly associated to the distinct behaviour of the nuclear photon spectrum compared with that of the proton at large photon energies @xcite . moreover , in our calculations for the nuclear case we are assuming that the nuclear parton distributions are given by the eks parametrization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the nuclear parton distributions are probed at @xmath81 , our results are sensitive to the magnitude of the antishadowing effect present in the eks parametrization , which predicts that @xmath82 and , consequently , implies an enhancement of the cross section in comparison with the predictions obtained disregarding the nuclear effects . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the eks parametrization predicts that these effects diminishes at larger @xmath51 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) we present the prediction obtained disregarding the nuclear effects at the @xmath83 range , which we denote no shad in the plot . in comparison to the eks prediction at the same @xmath51 range , </S>",
    "<S> the no shad one is almost 10 % smaller . </S>",
    "<S> this difference diminishes at the other @xmath51 ranges and the resulting predictions are almost identical to those obtained using the eks parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that we have verified that similar conclusions are obtained using the most modern parametrization for the nuclear effects proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in summary , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have extended the study of the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons with hadron dissociation in coherent interactions for the production of @xmath10 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cross sections and event / rates are large , which implies that the experimental analysis of these processes should be feasible at lhc . </S>"
