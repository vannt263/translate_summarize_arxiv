    "last years an extensive analysis of the data on highly excited light non - strange meson states up to a mass of 2400 mev collected by the crystal barrel experiment at lear ( cern ) has been published @xcite .",
    "the classification of these new data requires a better theoretical understanding of light meson mass spectra .",
    "the aim of this paper is to apply the relativistic quark model which proved to be successful in studying various properties of heavy hadrons to the calculation of the masses of the radially and orbitally excited light meson states .",
    "all main assumptions and fixed values of model parameters are preserved in the present investigation .",
    "light quarks are treated fully relativistically without the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "various non - strange and strange meson states with masses up to 2500 mev are considered .",
    "this is especially important , since light exotic states ( such as tetraquarks , glueballs , hybrids ) predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) are expected to have masses in this range @xcite .",
    "the experimental data show that a large degeneracy emerges in the spectra of the orbitally and radially excited resonances .",
    "it is argued @xcite that the states of the same spin with different isospins and opposite parities are approximately degenerate in the interval 1700 - 2400 mev .",
    "an intensive debate is going on now in the literature whether the chiral symmetry is restored for highly excited states ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "various phenomenological and theoretical arguments , such as quasiclassical considerations , ads / qcd etc . are used .",
    "a vast literature on the light meson spectroscopy is available .",
    "different attempts to study light mesons on the basis of the relativized quark model @xcite , the dyson - schwinger and bethe - salpeter equations @xcite , the tamm - dancoff method @xcite , chiral quark models with spontaneous symmetry breaking like the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , finite - energy sum rules in qcd @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite , ads / qcd models @xcite , etc . were undertaken .",
    "therefore we mostly refer to the recent reviews where the references to earlier review and original papers can be found .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we studied the masses of ground and radially excited states of light mesons on the basis of the three - dimensional relativistic wave equation with the qcd - motivated potential . in this analysis we took into account the highly relativistic dynamics of light quarks and carried out all calculations without either the @xmath1 or @xmath2 expansions .",
    "we also used the expression for the qcd coupling constant @xmath3 which exhibits freezing at small values of the momentum transfer .",
    "good overall agreement of the obtained predictions and experimental data was found .",
    "the consistent relativistic treatment of the light quark dynamics resulted in a nonlinear dependence of the bound state equation on the meson mass which allowed to get the correct values of the pion and kaon masses in the model with the explicitly broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the obtained wave functions of the pion and kaon were successfully applied for the relativistic calculation of their decay constants and electromagnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "recently , in the framework of the same approach we calculated masses of the ground - state light tetraquarks using the diquark - antidiquark picture @xcite .",
    "it was found that scalar mesons with masses below 1 gev agree well with the light - tetraquark interpretation .",
    "indeed , it explains naturally the peculiar inverted pattern of the mass ordering of the lightest scalar flavour @xmath4 nonet .",
    "here we investigate the regge trajectories both in ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) and ( @xmath5 , @xmath7 ) planes ( @xmath8 is the mass , @xmath6 is the spin and @xmath7 is the radial quantum number of the meson state ) , check their linearity and equidistance which follow from experimental data @xcite . the assignment of experimentally observed mesons to particular regge trajectories is proposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : rqm ] we describe the relativistic quark model , giving its main assumptions and parameters which were fixed in previous considerations .",
    "the relativistic quasipotential of the light quark - antiquark interaction in the meson is constructed in sec  [ sec : qpot ] . the procedure which makes this potential local and avoids the arising fictitious singularities",
    "is described in detail . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rd ] the obtained results for the masses of orbital and radial excitations of light mesons are presented and compared with available experimental data . finally , the regge trajectories are constructed .",
    "their linearity , parallelism and equidistance is verified , and the slopes of different trajectories are compared .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach a meson is described by the wave function of the bound quark - antiquark state , which satisfies the quasipotential equation of the schrdinger type  @xcite @xmath9 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are given by @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the meson mass , @xmath15 are the quark masses , and @xmath16 is their relative momentum . in the center - of - mass system",
    "the relative momentum squared on mass shell reads @xmath17[m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{4m^2}.\\ ] ]    the kernel @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ quas ] ) is the quasipotential operator of the quark - antiquark interaction .",
    "it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states .",
    "constructing the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction , we have assumed that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli interaction .",
    "the quasipotential is then defined by @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath3 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath21 is the gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the dirac matrices and spinors @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the effective long - range vector vertex is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pauli interaction constant characterizing the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks .",
    "vector and scalar confining potentials in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath30 reproducing @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "all the model parameters have the same values as in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "the light constituent quark masses @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 gev and the parameters of the linear potential @xmath35 gev@xmath36 and @xmath37 gev have the usual values of quark models .",
    "the value of the mixing coefficient of vector and scalar confining potentials @xmath38 has been determined from the consideration of charmonium radiative decays @xcite .",
    "finally , the universal pauli interaction constant @xmath39 has been fixed from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath40- states @xcite . in this case",
    ", the long - range chromomagnetic interaction of quarks , which is proportional to @xmath41 , vanishes in accordance with the flux - tube model .",
    "the quasipotential ( [ qpot ] ) can be used for arbitrary quark masses . the substitution of the dirac spinors ( [ spinor ] ) into ( [ qpot ] ) results in an extremely nonlocal potential in the configuration space .",
    "clearly , it is very hard to deal with such potentials without any additional transformations . in order to simplify the relativistic @xmath42 potential",
    ", we make the following replacement in the dirac spinors : @xmath43 ( see the discussion of this point in @xcite ) .",
    "this substitution makes the fourier transformation of the potential ( [ qpot ] ) local . calculating the potential , we keep only operators quadratic in the momentum acting on @xmath44 , @xmath45 and",
    "replace @xmath46 in higher order operators in accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub ] ) preserving the symmetry under the @xmath47 exchange .",
    "it is necessary to point out that such substitutions lead to the quark - antiquark potential which commutes with operators of the total angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum .",
    "therefore @xmath6 and @xmath48 are good quantum numbers , as in the nonrelativistic approach .",
    "however the nonlinear dependence of the interaction potential on the meson mass effectively takes into account the relativistic character of the light quark interaction .",
    "note that the global features of highly excited light mesons can be well understood in terms of the relativistic relations involving @xmath6 as well as nonrelativistic relations involving @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the substitution ( [ eq : sub ] ) works well for the confining part of the potential .",
    "however , it leads to fictitious singularities @xmath49 and @xmath50 at the origin arising from the one - gluon exchange part ( @xmath51 ) , which is absent in the initial potential .",
    "note that these singularities are not important if they are treated perturbatively . since we are not using the expansion in @xmath1 and",
    "are solving the quasipotential equation with the complete relativistic potential , an additional analysis is required .",
    "such singular contributions emerge , e.g. , from the following terms @xmath52^{1/2}}v_{\\rm coul}({\\bf k}^2 ) , \\cr & & \\frac{{\\bf k}^2}{[\\epsilon_1(q)\\epsilon_1(p )",
    "\\epsilon_2(q)\\epsilon_2(p)]^{1/2}}v_{\\rm coul}({\\bf k}^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we simply replace @xmath53 . however , the fourier transforms of expressions ( [ eq : st ] ) are less singular at @xmath54 . to avoid such fictitious singularities we note that if the binding effects are taken into account , it is necessary to replace @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the quark interaction potential and @xmath57 . at small distances",
    "@xmath58 , the coulomb singularity in @xmath56 dominates and gives the correct asymptotic behaviour .",
    "therefore , we replace @xmath59 in the fourier transforms of terms ( [ eq : st ] ) ( cf .",
    "we used a similar regularization of singularities in the analysis of heavy - light meson spectra @xcite .",

    "[ fig : pir ] , [ fig : kr ] and [ fig : pin ] by dashed lines , the fitted values of the slopes and intercepts are given in the footnotes to tables  [ tab : rtj ] and [ tab : rtn ] .",
    "this indicates the special role of the pion originating from the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : rr ] and [ fig : a0r ] that @xmath234 and @xmath235 do not lie on the corresponding regge trajectories .",
    "this further confirms our previous conclusion that @xmath235 should be predominantly a tetraquark state and suggests the possible exotic nature of @xmath234 .    from the comparison of the slopes in tables  [ tab : rtj ] , [ tab : rtn ] we see that the @xmath236 values are systematically larger than the @xmath237 ones .",
    "the ratio of their mean values is about 1.3 both for the light @xmath42 isovector and @xmath60 mesons .",
    "such ratio is lower than predictions of the qcd string model ( [ eq : str ] ) and massless salpeter equation ( [ eq : slsr ] ) . the mean value of the slope @xmath238",
    "gev@xmath229 for isovector mesons is about two times larger than the result of the above mentioned models @xmath239",
    "gev@xmath229 , for @xmath35  gev@xmath36 used in our approach .",
    "the assignment of the experimentally observed states to the corresponding regge trajectories in our model based on their masses and @xmath92 values ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : rr]-[fig : an ] ) is slightly different from the previous phenomenological analysis @xcite based on the equal values for the slopes @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "however the number of states , for which such correspondence is found , is approximately the same .",
    "future experimental data will shed further light on this issue .",
    "the mass spectra of light quark - antiquark mesons were calculated in the framework of the qcd - motivated relativistic quark model .",
    "all considerations were carried out without application of the unjustified nonrelativistic @xmath1 expansion .",
    "such approach leads to the nonlocal quasipotential of the relativistic quark - antiquark interaction . to make it local , the substitution ( [ eq : sub ] )",
    "was used . as a result",
    "the relativistic local quasipotential was obtained which depends on the mass of the meson in a complicated nonlinear way .",
    "such dependence allowed us to get masses of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 mesons in agreement with experimental data in the considered model , where the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the constituent quark masses .",
    "it was found that the lightest scalar ( @xmath102 ) states have masses above 1 gev .",
    "this confirms our previous conclusion @xcite that @xmath240 ( @xmath241 ) , @xmath242 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath243 and @xmath244 could be the diquark - antidiquark tetraquark states .",
    "it was found that the calculated masses of light mesons reproduce the linear regge trajectories both in the ( @xmath231 ) and @xmath232 planes .",
    "their slopes and intercepts were determined .",
    "the slope of the orbital excitations @xmath236 was found to be in average 1.3 times larger than the slope of the trajectories of radial excitations @xmath237 .",
    "this value of the ratio @xmath245 is smaller than the predictions based on the spinless salpeter equation ( [ eq : slp ] ) and the qcd string model .",
    "the obtained slope @xmath237 for the isovector light mesons is almost two times higher than the value predicted by the above models .",
    "possible experimental candidates for the states populating the regge trajectories are identified in figs .",
    "[ fig : rr]-[fig : an ] .",
    "predictions for the masses of the missing states are presented in tables  [ tab : nsmm],[tab : smm ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the chiral symmetry is not restored for highly excited states in our model .",
    "this should be expected since the lorentz - scalar part of the confining potential explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "our results in some cases differ from the previous phenomenological prescriptions @xcite .",
    "future experimental data can help in discriminating between the theoretical predictions .",
