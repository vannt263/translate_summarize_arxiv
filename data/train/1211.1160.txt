    "the hall effect in magnetic conductors has two contributions : a contribution known as the ordinary hall effect ( ohe ) associated with lorentz force and linked to the presence of a magnetic field @xmath8 , and a contribution known as the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) @xcite linked to magnetization @xmath9 .",
    "the ahe has been variously attributed to spin sensitive scattering , which makes its study relevant to spintronics and to topological features of the conduction bands , which have attracted considerable interest in the context of the quantum hall effect and topological insulators .",
    "the ahe resistivity , @xmath10 , is phenomenologically described as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the component of the magnetization perpendicular to the film and @xmath13 is called the ahe coefficient .",
    "extrinsic models relate @xmath13 to the longitudinal resistivity , @xmath14 , and predict @xmath15 , where the linear term in @xmath14 is attributed to skew - scattering @xcite , and the quadratic term is attributed to the side - jump mechanism @xcite .",

    "several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the ahe in manganites : a mechanism arising from double exchange quantal phases combined with spin - orbit interaction , which predicts scaling with the reduced magnetization @xcite , and a real space berry phase mechanism @xcite , which attributes the ahe to the spatial variation of magnetization induced by skyrmions .",
    "the ahe in manganites has previously been studied with magnetization perpendicular to the film plane .",

    "if the hall effect is determined by the perpendicular components of the magnetic field and the magnetization , a trivial @xmath17 dependence is expected .",
    "however , we find that the transverse resistivity ( @xmath0 ) follows @xmath18 .",
    "we show that the @xmath19 term is not solely due to the angular dependence of the longitudinal resistivity or the magnetization ; therefore , the surprising term is likely a manifestation of an intrinsic transport property that has not been identified so far .",

    "although the magnetization is almost field independent for the magnetic fields that we use , an easy plane anisotropy may cause a small change in the magnetization direction , i.e. , the ahe will follow @xmath76 . considering an easy plane anisotropy and a zeeman term hamiltonian ( @xmath77 , where @xmath74 is the anisotropy constant )",
    ", we obtain that for @xmath78 the deviation from the field direction takes the form @xmath79 .",

    "figure  [ fig : anisotropy ] ( bottom ) presents the ratio between the anisotropy constant that which should be assumed in order to explain @xmath73 with this scenario and the measured anisotropy constant as a function of temperature . as can be seen , this scenario yields a good description of @xmath73 below 50 k ; nevertheless , this source predicts a field dependent anisotropy constant that is significantly higher than the measured one .",
    "in addition to its effect on the magnetization direction , the magnetic anisotropy may affect the magnitude of the magnetization . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : he ] , the ahe is given by @xmath83 .",
    "since the magnetization is close to saturation and weakly dependent on @xmath33 , we may approximate its field dependence by @xmath84 .",
    "considering the anisotropy effective field @xmath81 , we obtain that the total field applied in the direction of the magnetization takes the form : @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the ahe is given by : @xmath86\\cos\\theta\\\\ & = r_s \\mu_0 [ ( m-\\frac{dm}{dh}\\frac{k}{2m_s})+\\frac{dm}{dh}\\frac{k}{2m_s}\\sin^2\\theta]\\cos\\theta .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] therefore this source yields a positive contribution to @xmath73 , which can not explain the measured negative @xmath73 .",
    "as we have ruled out trivial sources for the @xmath87 term , it appears that other sources should be considered .",
    "we note that as the temperature increases , @xmath6 increases ; and as the magnetic field increases , @xmath6 decreases ( see figure  [ fig : parm](b ) ) .",
    "this behavior may suggest that @xmath6 decreases when @xmath9 approaches saturation either by increasing the field or by decreasing the temperature .",
    "it has been shown that spatial variations in the magnetization may yield a contribution to the ahe in manganites @xcite ; however , a @xmath88 dependence is not expected in this model .",
    "we point out that structural and magnetic symmetries were previously identified as sources for a more complicated angular dependence of the amr and phe in epitaxial films of manganites @xcite ; however , we do not see a simple way to correlate such effects with our observations .    in conclusion , we find that the ahe in la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3  films can not be described by the simple relation to the perpendicular component of the magnetization . a more careful treatment that takes into account the lattice and magnetic anisotropies is required .",
