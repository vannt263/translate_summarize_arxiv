    "the nature of the superconducting state in mgb@xmath0 has been characterized by a broad range of experimental and theoretical methods and many basic properties have been unambiguously established since the discovery of the 40k superconductor mgb@xmath0 by nagamatsu and collaborators @xcite .    while electron - phonon coupling as the underlying pairing mechanism has been pinpointed by a large b isotope effect on @xmath2 proving b related vibrations to be essential @xcite the nature of the order - parameter ( viz .",
    "the superconducting gap ) has remained a matter of debate .",
    "the order - parameter has been intensively investigated by tunnelling and point contact spectroscopy as well as by high - resolution photoelectron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "while these techniques show an energy gap in the quasiparticle spectrum most likely of @xmath5-wave symmetry the magnitude of the gap , @xmath6 , itself remained an open question : tunnelling experiments initially revealed a distribution of energy gaps with lower boundary 2@xmath7/@xmath81.1 and upper boundary 2@xmath9/@xmath84.5 .",
    "these values are either considerably lower or distinctly larger than the weak coupling bcs value of 2@xmath6/@xmath103.53 and these controversial findings have been discussed in terms of gap anisotropy or more recently attributed to the presence of two gaps or multiple gaps @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the electronic raman continuum of mgb@xmath0 by chen _",
    "_ @xcite also pointed to the presence of two gaps with gap values within the limits indicated by the tunnelling experiments @xcite .",
    "while these experiments employ surface sensitive techniques to determine the gap properties , evidence for multigap behaviour emerges also from methods like heat capacity or @xmath11 measurements probing true bulk properties @xcite . in the early heat capacity",
    "experiments the typical jump - like anomaly is seen at @xmath2 the magnitude @xmath12/@xmath2 of which amounts at best to only about 70 - 80% of the value 1.43@xmath13 predicted by weak - coupling bcs theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 is the sommerfeld constant in the normal state which was obtained from heat capacity measurements in high magnetic fields and which was determined to be 2.7 - 3 mj mol@xmath14k@xmath15 .",
    "the shape of the heat capacity anomaly compares reasonably well with bcs - type behaviour assuming 2@xmath6/@xmath16=3.53 with appropriately adjusted magnitude .",
    "an improved fit of the detailed temperature dependence of the heat capacity anomaly was obtained when calculating the heat capacity within the @xmath17-model @xcite assuming a bcs temperature dependence of the gap but with an increased ratio 2@xmath6/@xmath16=4.2(2 ) @xcite .",
    "this result matches very well with the upper limit of the gap value consistently found in the tunnelling experiments and was suggested as an evidence that mgb@xmath0 is in the moderately strong coupling limit .",
    "more recently , the excess heat capacity observed close to @xmath2/4 by bouquet _",
    "_ @xcite and wang .",
    "@xcite has been attributed to a second smaller gap .",
    "fits with a phenomenological two - gap model assuming that the heat capacity of mgb@xmath0 can be composed as a sum of the two individual heat capacities gave very good description with gap values of 2@xmath7/@xmath16=1.2(1 ) and 2@xmath9/@xmath18 4 @xcite .",
    "recent muon - spin - relaxation measurements of the magnetic penetration depth are consistent with a two - gap model @xcite .",
    "theoretically multigap superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 was first proposed by shulga _",
    "_ to explain the behaviour of the upper critical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "based on the electronic structure the existence of multiple gaps has been suggested by liu _ et al . _ in order to explain the magnitude of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of mgb@xmath0 contains four fermi surface sheets @xcite .",
    "two of them with 2d character emerging from bonding @xmath4 bands form small cylindrical fermi surfaces around @xmath19-a .",
    "the other two originating from bonding and antibonding @xmath3 bands have 3d character and form a tubular network .",
    "et al . _ from first - principles calculations of the electron - phonon coupling conclude that the superconducting gap is different for the individual sheets and they obtain two different order parameters , a larger one on the 2d fermi surface sheets and a second gap on the 3d fermi surfaces , the latter was estimated to be approximately a factor of three reduced compared to the former @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the specific heat capacity from the spectral eliashberg function @xmath20 first in the one - band model using the isotropic @xmath20 as given by kong _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "then we calculate the heat capacity in a two - band model by reducing the 16 eliashberg functions @xmath21 appropriate for the four fermi surface sheets into four eliashberg functions corresponding to an effective - two - band model with a @xmath4-band and @xmath3-band only . from the solution of the eliashberg equations we obtain a superconducting gap ratio @xmath22 in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the two - band model explains the reduced magnitude of the heat capacity anomaly at @xmath2 very well and also reproduces the experimental observed excess heat capacity at low temperatures .",
    "first we discuss the specific heat in the isotropic single band model with a strong ( intermediate ) electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) . in the normal state and in the adiabatic approximation the electronic contribution to the specific heat is determined from the eliashberg function @xmath23 by the expression @xcite @xmath24 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a bare density of states per spin at the fermi energy .",
    "the kernel @xmath26 is expressed in terms of the derivatives of the digamma function @xmath27 @xmath28    at low temperatures the specific heat has the well known asymptotic form : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the electron - phonon coupling constant , and @xmath31 is the specific heat coefficient for noninteracting electrons . at higher temperatures the specific heat differs from this trivial expression (",
    "see , the discussion in reference @xcite ) .    in the superconducting state",
    "an expression for the specific heat obtained by bardeen and stephen @xcite which is based on an _ approximate _ sum rule has often been used .",

    "their respective densities of states at the fermi energy have values of @xmath55 states / cell@xmath56ev and @xmath57 states / cell@xmath56ev .",
    "similar coupling constants @xmath58 , and @xmath59 which are required for a two - band model were calculated earlier in reference@xcite .",
    "the procedure of reducing the 16 eliashberg functions of the real 4 band system due to the 4 different fermi surface sheets to an effective two - band model with only four coupling constants @xmath60 is an approximation which is based on the similarity of the two cylindrical and the two three - dimensional sheets of the fermi surface requiring the same physical properties in both @xmath4-bands or both @xmath3-bands .",
    "more details can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the four eliashberg functions @xmath61 for the effective two - band model are shown in figure  [ fig : eliash ] .",
    "the most significant contribution comes from the coupling of the bond stretching phonon modes to the @xmath4-band .",
    "the coupling constants corresponding to the superconducting eliashberg functions have been calculated to be : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the small difference to the values given in reference @xcite may be attributed to the different first - principles methods used in the calculation of the eliashberg functions .    besides the spectral functions we need to know the the coulomb matrix element @xmath64 . with the help of the wavefunctions from our first - principles calculations we can approximately calculate the ratios for the @xmath65-matrix @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66- , @xmath67- and @xmath68-values were in the ratio 2.23/2.48/1 .",
    "this allows one to express @xmath69 by these ratios and one single free parameter which is fixed to get the experimental @xmath2 of 39.4 k from the solution of the eliashberg equations .",
    "the @xmath70 matrix elements determined by this procedure are @xmath71=0.210 , @xmath72=0.095 , @xmath73=0.069 , and @xmath74=0.172 .    using our calculated eliashberg functions on the imaginary ( matsubara ) axis together with the above matrix @xmath75",
    "we obtain the gap values @xmath76mev , and @xmath77mev , which corresponds to @xmath78=4.18 and @xmath79=1.59 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps is shown in figure  [ delta2 ] .",
    "the filled circles ( squares ) display the gap for the 2d @xmath4- ( 3d @xmath3- ) band . due to interband coupling between the bands both gaps close at the same critical temperature . for a comparison",
    "also the bcs curve ( line ) is shown for a single gap ( one - band model ) which closes at @xmath2=39.4 k. the corresponding single bcs gap would be 6 mev .",
    "the extension of equation [ cn ] to the two - band model gives @xmath80   \\label{twoband}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , and the function @xmath26 is given by equation [ func ] .",
    "the generalization of the superconducting free energy ( [ free ] ) to the two band model is straightforward and the heat capacity was obtained according to equation [ partial ] .",
    "for the comparison with experiment we have selected data obtained by our group @xcite and by bouquet .",
    "the anomaly clearly visible at @xmath2 in the zero - field data is suppressed by a magnetic field of 9 tesla in both experiments . in figure",
    "[ fig : cp ] we display the difference @xmath83 .",
    "the anomalies at @xmath2 detected by both groups clearly have a different magnitude , the one described in reference @xcite amounts to 133 mj / mol k at @xmath2 and represents the largest specific heat capacity anomaly reported for mgb@xmath0 so far @xcite .",
    "the @xmath84 reported by our group is somewhat smaller , however , the shape of the anomalies close to @xmath2 is very similar for both samples .",
    "in fact , fitting the anomalies with the @xmath17-model revealed an identical ratio @xmath85=4.2 with @xmath86=7 mev for both samples @xcite .",
    "first we will try to discuss the experimental results in terms of a conventional one - band model .",
    "the specific heat in mgb@xmath87 was calculated using the isotropic spectral eliashberg function @xmath88 of kong _ et al .",
    ". this function yields an electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath89 and together with a coulomb pseudopotential of @xmath90 yields @xmath91 k. the calculated specific heat at @xmath92 is @xmath93 mj / molk@xmath94 with @xmath95=1.67 mj / molk@xmath94 from the band structure calculations of reference  @xcite .",
    "the specific heat jump at @xmath2 equals @xmath96 196 mj / mol k , which is a factor of 1.5 - 2 larger than the experimental values @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath97 1.51 compared to the bcs value of 1.43 .",
    "the difference @xmath98 is shown in figure  [ fig : cp ] ( dashed - dot line ) in comparison with the experimental data",
    ". not only the size of the jump disagrees with the experiment , but also the behaviour at low temperatures is different .",
    "the latter is connected with the fact that at low temperature equation ( [ free ] ) for a single band model leads to the standard exponential dependence @xmath99 , while the experimental data show a more complicated behaviour .",
    "clearly there exists a discrepancy between experimental data and a theoretical one - band model .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : cp ] represents the theoretical results for the two - band model as described above .",
    "the low temperature behaviour is in much better agreement with the experiment .",
    "the specific heat jump is now significantly reduced in comparison with a single band model and reproduces surprisingly well the experimental data of reference  @xcite . with the data given above we obtain from our theoretical calculation an electronic heat capacity in the normal state of @xmath100 mj / mol k@xmath101 , the same value as for the one - band model .",
    "the absolute value of the specific heat jump in the two - band model is @xmath102 125 mj / mol k , corresponding to @xmath103 0.98 which is now smaller than the bcs value .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that no fitting is involved in the theoretical calculations .",
    "the only free parameter which is in the coulomb matrix elements is already determined by the experimental @xmath2 of 39.4 k.    one could expect that the difference between the theoretical results of the effective two - band model and our experimental data may be attributable to a different amount of impurities in the samples compared to the samples of reference @xcite . in the one - band model the critical temperature @xmath2 as well as the value and the temperature dependence of @xmath104 are not affected by non - magnetic impurities ( anderson theorem ) .",
    "this is in complete contrast to the situation for the two - band model , where both quantities are strongly dependent on _ interband _ impurity scattering .",
    "interband impurity scattering leads to averaging of the gaps and thus to the increase of @xmath105 ratio . on the other hand , due to decrease of @xmath2 , the specific heat jump only depends weakly on the scattering strength . in order to investigate the dependence of @xmath2 and of @xmath12 on the interband impurity scattering we included the effect of interband impurities in the eliashberg equations .",
    "the results show that even for rather strong impurity scattering @xmath106 k , which leads to a drastic change of the critical temperature ( decreasing to @xmath2=29.4 k ) and strong averaging of the gaps , the specific heat jump remains practically unchanged @xmath107 120 mj / mol k. this corresponds to a ratio @xmath108 1.48 , which is very close to the corresponding value of a single gap model .",
    "therefore , interband impurity scattering can explain the change of @xmath2 in different samples , but is not responsible for the observed different values of the specific heat capacity anomaly at @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that a complete theoretical calculation from first - principles using an effective two - band model can explain the major features in the specific heat measurement of mgb@xmath0 surprisingly well .",
    "the presented theoretical framework goes beyond a simple phenomenological two - gap model because interband effects are included explicitely and no fitting to experimental results has been performed .",
    "the reduced value of the heat capacity anomaly at @xmath2 as well as the low temperature behaviour are in excellent agreement with experimental results .",
    "the same first - principles approach using exactly the same eliashberg functions and coulomb matrix elements has been used in order to explain optical measurements @xcite and tunnelling experiments @xcite of the interesting superconductor mgb@xmath0 .",
