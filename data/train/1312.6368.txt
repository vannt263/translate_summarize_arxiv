    "in quantum physics , one of the most essential features is termed quantum entanglement . the counterintuitive properties of entanglement in quantum theory had ever induced a dispute over the physical reality @xcite , but eventually entanglement was verified experimentally and recognized as a valid , fundamental feature of quantum mechanics .",
    "einstein - podolsky - rosen entanglement state and schrdinger cat state has now become two well - known bipartite entanglements . compared with the bipartite entanglement",
    ", the multipartite entanglement possesses more peculiar properties .",
    "greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , named after d. greenberger , m. a. horne and a. zeilinger in 1989 @xcite , is a type of canonical multipartite entangled quantum state which involves at least three subsystems .",
    "these states are defined to be maximally entangled because they maximally violate the famous bell - type inequalities and exhibit strong nonlocality @xcite .",
    "therefore the correlations in ghz states are especially useful in some quantum information tasks such as multipartner quantum cryptography @xcite and communication complexity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as a central and fundamental task for actualizing a quantum computer , physical implementation of universal set of quantum gate lies at the heart of quantum computation .",
    "although the principle of universal quantum computation allows to construct an arbitrary quantum gate with a series of single qubit operations along with two - qubit gates @xcite , this kind of composition becomes inefficient as applied to a multi - qubit gate for the procedure will become more complicated and the quantum system will be more susceptible to the environment , since uncontrolled interaction or decoherence exists in each gate in the experiment .",
    "thus direct realization of a multi - qubit quantum gate can greatly simplify the procedures and enhance efficiency for quantum information processing .",
    "in particular , the multi - qubit quantum gates usually play a key role in quantum algorithms @xcite and quantum error - correction protocols @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the potential application of neutral rydberg atoms on preparation of quantum entanglement and quantum computation .",
    "the advantage for adopting neutral atom as qubit is that the quanutm information is encoded into the stable hyperfine ground states and distant atoms interact with each other through rydberg blockade @xcite .",
    "the rydberg blockade regime is based on the assumption that one excited atom causes a sufficiently large energy shifts of rydberg states in a neighboring atom to effectively detune it away from resonance and fully block its excitation by a laser field .",
    "this mechanism was originally proposed by jaksch _",
    "et al . _ for implementing fast two - qubit quantum gates for neutral atoms",
    "@xcite , then it was observed experimentally @xcite and has been explored to perform various tasks such as entangled state preparation @xcite , quantum algorithms @xcite , quantum simulators @xcite , and efficient quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "different from previous works with a strong rydberg blockade @xcite , we show here that a intermediate rydberg interaction with a comparable magnitude to the two - photon detuning is especially functional for creation of multipartite ghz state and controlled - phase gate .",
    "this manuscript is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the effective hamiltonian for preparation of tripartite ghz state and three - qubit controlled - phase gate , and also investigate the effect of decoherence induced by spontaneous emission of rydberg state . in section iii , we generalize the scheme to realization of multipartite ghz state and multi - qubit controlled phase gate . in section iv , we give a conclusion of this manuscript .",
    "the system consists of three identical @xmath2rb atoms trapped in three separate microscopic dipole traps , and the relevant configuration of atomic level is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ p0](a ) , where the quantum states @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to atomic levels @xmath7 and @xmath1 of @xmath8 manifold , and the optical state @xmath9 of @xmath10 and rydberg state @xmath11 of @xmath12 . in order to excite from @xmath6 to @xmath13 without population of the optical state @xmath14 , we apply a @xmath15-polarized laser , with rabi frequency @xmath16 , blue - detuning @xmath17 , to drive the transition from ground state @xmath6 to optical state @xmath14 , and a @xmath18-polarized laser , with rabi frequency @xmath19 , red - detuning @xmath20 , to couple to the transition @xmath14 to @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian of system in a rotating frame reads @xcite    @xmath21    where the dipole - dipole potential with energy @xmath22 is non - zero when atoms @xmath23 simultaneously occupy the rydberg state @xmath13 . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the decay rates of spontaneous emission for optical state @xmath14 and rydberg state @xmath13 , respectively . since the rydberg state lifetime is much longer than the optical state lifetime @xmath26 , we can adiabatically eliminate the state @xmath14 by setting @xmath27 , then the hamiltonian is obtained through the second - order perturbation theory : @xmath28 the stark - shift term @xmath29 can be absorbed in @xmath30 or canceled together with @xmath31 via introducing ancillary levels",
    ". then the model reduces to a three - level system as shown in fig .",
    "[ p0](b ) . in",
    "what follows , we first neglect the spontaneous emission of rydberg state and consider a ideal situation with equal rydberg interaction @xmath32 for each pair of atoms . supposing the atoms are initially prepared in state @xmath33 , we then expand the hamiltonian in corresponding subspace @xmath34 as    @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 .",
    "( [ one11 ] ) describes a climbing process from the ground state @xmath33 to the three - excited state @xmath3 .",
    "if the rydberg interaction @xmath37 is much stronger than the two - photon detuning @xmath38 , the state @xmath33 can only couple to the collective single - excited state @xmath39 , and this relates to rydberg blockade regime , where the population of bi - excited state is prohibited .",
    "however , we here take into account another regime where the strength of rydberg interaction has a comparable magnitude to the two - photon detuning . reexamining eq .",
    "( [ one11 ] ) we find the skew diagonal is mirror symmetric , thus it is possible to transfer the quantum information between @xmath33 and @xmath3 by adjusting the strengths of diagonal elements . in connection with current situation",
    ", we chose the parameters satisfying @xmath40 .",
    "this selection will result in an interesting model , i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath3 couple to the collective single- and bi - excited states with the same detuning @xmath41 , while these two collective excited states resonantly interact with each other .",
    "if we further assume @xmath42 , an effective raman coupling between the ground state @xmath33 and three - excited rydberg state @xmath3 is achieved as follow @xmath43 where @xmath44 originates from the stark - shift of @xmath45 due to the dispersive interaction with collective single(bi)-excited state , and @xmath46 is the effective coupling strength calculated by third - order perturbation theory .",
    "it is not difficult to see that a ghz state @xmath47 will be generated at the appropriate time @xmath48 , where we have shorten @xmath49 as @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ p1 ] , we plot the populations of corresponding states @xmath33 , @xmath3 , @xmath51 as a function of time in unites of @xmath52 for fixed @xmath40 , where the upper panel works in the regime @xmath53 and the lower panel endowed a larger detuning @xmath54 . we see that under the given parameters the full and the effective dynamics eqs  ( [ 222 ] ) and ( [ 444 ] ) of the system are in excellent agreement .",
    "note one may also map @xmath51 to @xmath55 through a similar effective raman coupling process between @xmath3 and @xmath56 or a series of single - qubit operations @xmath57 .",
    "now we apply the above mechanism to implement a three - qubit controlled - phase gate . this quantum gate is closely related to toffoli gate which is valuable in complex quantum algorithms such as shor s algorithm and grover s algorithm .",
    "the quantum information is stored in two hyperfine ground states @xmath5 and @xmath6 separated in frequency by 6.8 ghz . consider a general input state    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the corresponding amplitude of probability obeying the normalization @xmath60 .",
    "the state @xmath5 is decoupled to the dynamical evolution , and the single - atom state @xmath6 dispersively interacts with the rydberg state @xmath13 with rabi frequency @xmath50 , detuned by @xmath41 , while the two - atom state @xmath61 couples to the bell state @xmath62 with rabi frequency @xmath63 , detuned by @xmath41 .",
    "thus the large - detuned dynamical evolution combines the stark - shift terms of states @xmath64 and rabi oscillation of state @xmath33 . at an arbitrary time @xmath65",

    "this transformation does an entangling operation for it is locally unitary equivalent to the stand controlled - phase gate @xmath71 , the phase factor @xmath72 can be canceled by sequentially single - qubit @xmath73 gates on @xmath64 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ pzz ] , we plot the fidelity of gate by considering an entangling operation on the input state @xmath66 with equivalent weight of computational through the definition @xmath74|$ ] @xcite .",
    "the different curves correspond to different values of the two - photon detuning @xmath38 .",
    "a larger ratio @xmath75 naturally creates a higher gate fidelity accompanying a longer interaction time . among these curves ,",
    "we find a selection of @xmath76 ( black curve ) just corresponds to a genuine three - qubit controlled - phase gate because of @xmath77 , and the right panel of fig .",
    "[ pzz ] characterizes a deviation of @xmath38 for executing such a quantum gate . in the ideal case ,",
    "the gate fidelity approaches 99.40% , which is much higher than the scheme proposed by wu _",
    "@xcite , even when @xmath78 or @xmath79 , a fidelity above @xmath80 is still achievable . in this sense ,",
    "our scheme is robust against the mismatch of experimental parameters . in addition , although the rydberg state lifetime is relative long , it is necessary to assess the effect of spontaneous emission on the performance of entangling and gating operation . to evaluate the dynamics in the presence of this dissipative effect , we solve the master equation @xmath81 + \\sum_{i=1}^3\\hat{o}^{(j)\\dag}_i\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{o}^{(j)}_i,$ ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and we assume the branching rations of the atom decay from level @xmath13 to @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equal @xmath84 . fig .",
    "[ py ] illustrates the contours of fidelities for preparation of ghz state ( left ) and quantum gate ( right ) versus the decay rate @xmath85 and two - photon detuning @xmath75 , respectively . for both cases ,",
    "the fidelities raise in an oscillating form as increase of @xmath38 , and they are away from the optimal value in the presence of @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , we can still obtain an acceptable fidelity under different situations .",
    "for example , as @xmath87 , @xmath88 , the fidelity for ghz state is able to reach 99.46% ; and @xmath53 guarantees the fidelity exceeding 90% at a large decay rate @xmath89 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be made on the gate operation .",
    "experimentally @xcite , the lifetime of rydberg state is about @xmath90khz , the rabi frequency @xmath16 of the red laser is @xmath91mhz , and the rabi frequency @xmath19 of the blue laser is @xmath92mhz . to adiabatically eliminate the optical state @xmath14 , we choose @xmath93 , and these parameters correspond to an effective decay rate @xmath94 . by substituting these values into the master equation , we have the fidelities for generation of the entanglement state 96.75% as @xmath88 and for the controlled - phase gate 96.54% as @xmath76 , which shows that the current scheme is a robust one .",
    "in general , the dynamical behavior for a quantum system involving many particles is hard to determined because of the complex interaction among particles . thus gaining an effective multipartite interaction helpful for quantum information processing even in theory",
    "is not only interesting but also meets the requirement of technological development . in this section",
    ", we aim to generalize our proposal to achieving a multipartite entangled states and performing a multi - qubit logic gate from the theoretical point of view .",
    "although there may be many limitations that constrain this extension in reality , it will provides a new mechanism on the quantum information processing with neutral atoms .",
    "we initialize @xmath95 atoms in the ground state @xmath96 , under the action of two - photon transition , this state will interact with an @xmath95-atom single - excitated state @xmath97 with coupling constant @xmath98 , detuning @xmath41 . and",
    "the state @xmath99 further climbs upward a higher collective bi - excited state and so on , till the @xmath95-excited rydberg state @xmath100 .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be expanded in the following matrix form    @xmath101,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath102 denotes the binomial coefficient . for the purpose of directly coupling @xmath96 and @xmath100 ,",
    "we regulate @xmath103 , then the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath104 it is easy to check that both the diagonal and the skew are mirror symmetry , so we can have a raman coupling between the ground state and rydber state in virtue of @xmath95-order perturbation theory . to test and verify our assumption , we numerically simulate the four - qubit ghz state and quantum gate in fig .",
    "[ pz ] , where we have set @xmath105 to get a good approximation for entangled preparation and @xmath106 to achieve a stand four - qubit controlled - phase gate .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a robust way for one - step generation of tripartite ghz state and controlled - phase gate on neutral rydberg atoms .",
    "this scheme works well in the regime where the rydberg interaction holds a comparable strength to the two - photon detuning .",
    "an @xmath95-qubit ghz state and quantum logic gate are then straightly generalized , which can be confirmed by the simulation a four - particle system .",
