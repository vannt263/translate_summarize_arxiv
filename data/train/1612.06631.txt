    "the proton radius puzzle @xcite presents an open problem in both particle physics and nuclear physics . due to the emergence of the precision lamb shift measurements of the muonic hydrogen atom ( @xmath3p ) , it has received much attention in the last few years . the muonic hydrogen result for the proton radius is @xmath1 = 0.84087 @xmath4 0.00039 fm @xcite , which differs by about 7.9 standard deviations from the codata value of @xmath1 = 0.8775 @xmath4 0.0051 fm @xcite .",
    "the codata value comes from the analysis of electron - proton scattering data and electronic hydrogen spectroscopy .",
    "this disagreement , called proton radius puzzle , has not been solved yet .",
    "there are many proposals to resolve the proton radius puzzle via novel interactions for ep and @xmath3p @xcite or by applying some algorithms , such as polynomial fits@xcite , bayesian inference@xcite , etc .    in this paper",
    ", we use the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to extract the proton radius .",
    "this approach is inspired by ref .",
    "we consider the entropy as a function of the proton radius .",
    "when considering other non - perturbative components for the proton radius correction , we get reasonable results for the proton radius and the proportion of these other non - perturbative components in the proton .",
    "the other non - perturbative components include the cloud sea in the @xmath5 cloud model @xcite , the five - quark components of the proton @xcite , the intrinsic sea quark in light front qcd theory @xcite , and the connected sea quarks in lqcd @xcite .",
    "finally , we compare the predicted up and down valence quark momentum distributions with the global qcd fits ct10 @xcite , mstw08(lo ) @xcite and imparton16 @xcite , and find that our obtained up and down valence quark momentum distributions are nearly consistent with the popular parton distribution functions from qcd global analyses .",
    "the quark model has been a great success in the study of hadron spectra and reaction dynamics in the last decades , and it has revealed the internal symmetry of hadrons .",
    "the proton consists of three colored quarks at a low scale @xmath6 .",
    "thus , a naive nonperturbative description of the proton includes only these three valence quarks @xcite , which is the simplest initial parton distribution .",
    "the simplest functional form used to parametrize the valence quark distribution is the time - honored canonical parametrization @xmath7 @xcite , which provides a good approximation to the valence distribution at large @xmath8 ( bjorken scaling variable ) .",
    "therefore we use the naive inputs @xmath9 in the proton there are two @xmath10 quarks and one @xmath11 quark .",
    "this yields the valence sum rules for the naive non - perturbtive inputs @xmath12    when considering the presence of other non - perturbative components in the proton @xcite , we define @xmath13(@xmath14 ) as the contribution of other non - perturbative proton constituents to the momentum .",

    "hence , the momentum sum rule for valence quarks using the naive input is @xmath16dx=1 .",

    "the valence quarks in a proton are confined to a small spatial region .",
    "according to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle , the momenta of the quarks in the proton are therefore uncertain , and are described by probability density distributions .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle is @xmath18 the uncertainty relation is @xmath19 for a quantum harmonic oscillator in the ground state in quantum mechanics . in order to constrain the standard deviation of the quark momentum distributions ,",
    "@xmath19 is assumed for the three initial valence quarks in our analysis instead of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is related to the radius of the proton .",
    "a simple estimation of @xmath21 is @xmath22 , with r is a proton radius .",
    "@xmath21 of each @xmath10 valence quark is divided by @xmath23 as there are two @xmath10 valence quarks in the spatial region .",
    "then we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the bjorken scaling variable @xmath8 is the momentum fraction carried by one parton in the proton .",
    "therefore , the standard deviation of @xmath8 at an extremely low resolution scale @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the momentum of the proton , which is equals to the mass ( 0.938 gev @xcite ) of the proton .",
    "constraints for the valence quark distributions from qcd confinement and the heisenberg uncertainty principle are expressed in @xcite . then by applying the mem",
    ", we can estimate the proton radius and get the valence quark distributions from the constraint equations discussed above .",
    "the generalized information entropy of the valence quarks is defined as @xmath29 dx .",
    "\\end{aligned } \\label{entropyfor}\\ ] ]    in this paper we will consider two cases corresponding to distinct non - perturbative inputs . in the first case , the proton does not contain the other non - perturbative components , so the valence quarks carry all of the momentum of proton .",
    "then the momentum sum equals 1 for valence quarks at @xmath26 .",
    "the other case is that there are also flavor asymmetric sea components @xcite in the naive non - perturbative input .",
    "namely , the flavor asymmetric sea components carry part of the momentum of the proton . by considering the above two cases , we are able to estimate the values of the proton radii and the distribution functions of the valence quarks",
    ". then we find an expression that relates the proton radius to the proportion of other non - perturbative components in the proton .",
    "finally , we compare our predicted valence quark momentum distributions with the latest global fits of parton distribution functions .",
    "we consider the information entropy s(@xmath30 , r ) as a function of the variable @xmath30 and the proton radius r. the momentum sum for valence quarks equals 1 in eq .",

    "1 shows the information entropy of the valence quark distributions of the proton at the starting scale as a function of the parameters r and @xmath30 . we assume that valence quarks carry all of the momentum of the proton in fig .",
    "1 . using the mem , we find that the r is optimized at 0.745 fm , and @xmath30 is 0.03411 .",
    "the corresponding valence quarks distributions are as follows @xmath32    analysing fig . 1",
    ", we find that the proton radius is smaller than the muonic hydrogen result and the codate analysis .",
    "next , flavor - asymmetric sea components @xcite will be included and found to be a rather better non - perturbative input .",
    "namely , we will allow the proton to contain other non - perturbative components in addition to the three valence quarks . in order to better explain the value of proton radius estimated by the mem",
    ", we should take into account the contribution of other non - perturbative components to the proton radius .",
    "the non - perturbative components include the cloud sea in the pion cloud @xcite , the five - quark components in the proton @xcite , the intrinsic sea quark in light front qcd theory @xcite , and the connected sea quarks in lqcd @xcite .",
    "these non - perturbative components lead to the flavor asymmetric sea quarks in the proton .",
    "in addition , muon - hydrogen and muon - deuterium deep inelastic scattering measurements also find an excess of @xmath33 and @xmath34 sea quarks @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the value of the proton radius is smaller than the muonic hydrogen result and the codata analysis when valence quarks carry all the momentum of proton supports the case for the pion cloud model or other models .",
    "so we need to consider the proportion of momentum carried by other non - perturbative components of the proton .",
    "then we scan the momentum fraction ( @xmath31 ) for other non - perturbative components from 0.00 to 0.25 .        [",

    "2 , r represents the proton radius in fm and @xmath31 represents the momentum fraction of other non - perturbative components in the proton .",
    "the proton radius is approximately equal to the muonic hydrogen experimental result and the codata analysis when other non - perturbative components account for 17.5% and 22.3% respectively . through the fitting of the data points , we get an expression for the relationship between the proton radius and the momentum fraction of other non - perturbative components in the proton @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are adjustable parameters .",
    "the expressions ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are the relationship between the proton radius and the momentum fraction of other non - perturbative components in the proton .",
    "the expressions ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) are a linear function and a quadratic function , respectively . through fitting the data points in table  [ tab : ccs0 ] , where table  [ tab : ccs ] gives the fitted parameters with their errors",

    "3 shows the information entropy of the valence quark distribution of the proton at the starting scale as a function of the parameters r and @xmath30 .",
    "according to the mem , r is optimized at 0.841 fm , and @xmath30 is 0.00903 when the other non - perturbative components occupy 17.5 percent of the proton s momentum .",
    "then the corresponding valence quarks distributions are as follows @xmath40    next we consider the information entropy of the valence quark distribution of the proton at the starting scale as a function of the parameters r , @xmath30 and m. here the momentum sum m in the expression ( 3 ) is a free parameter . by fitting ,",
    "r is optimized at 0.745 fm , @xmath30 at 0.0341 and m is 1 .",
    "the proton radius r , @xmath30 and m are equivalent to the situation in which we take the proton radius r and @xmath30 as the free parameters and assume that valence quarks take the total momentum of the proton .",
    "so the corresponding valence quark distributions are equivalent to the distributions ( 8) .    through the analysis of the above results , we can find that the proton radius is smaller than muonic hydrogen result and the codate result if the proton only contains three valence quarks .",
    "the value of proton radius which we estimated using the mem is approximately equal to the measured value of the muonic hydrogen(@xmath3p ) experiment and the codate analysis when the other non - perturbative components account for 17.5% and 22.3% of the proton momentum , respectively .",

    "5 shows the comparisons of our predicted up and down valence quark momentum distributions from expression ( 11 ) with global qcd fits ct10 , mstw08(lso ) and imparton16 .",
    "one can see that the up and down valence quark momentum distributions which we obtained are basically consistent with the popular parton distribution functions from qcd global analyses .",
    "we have attempted to determine the proton radius and parton distribution functions using the mem and to determine the presence of other non - perturbative components of the proton .",
    "we found a quadratic polynomial that relates the proton radius and the proportion of other non - perturbative components in the proton . the obtained proton radius , which considers the pion cloud model or intrinsic sea quarks or connected sea quarks or the other non - perturbative components , is consistent with the muonic hydrogen atom result and the codata analysis when the other non - perturbation components account for 17.5% and 22.3% , respectively . moreover , the valence quark distributions are basically consistent with the experimental observations from high energy lepton probes and pdfs from global analyses .",
    "however the mem is applicable for obtaining the proton radius and valence quark distributions with the least bias in situations where detailed information is not given . through calculation and analysis",
    ", we find that the proton radius , the proportion of other non - perturbative components in the proton and valence quarks distributions obtained by the mem are reasonable .",
    "the difference in the non - perturbative components between the muonic hydrogen atom result and the codata analysis is 4.8% .",
    "an interesting question is whether electron from the codata analysis is more likely to detect other non - perturbative components than the muon from the muonic hydrogen atom result .",
    "we propose @xmath2 to explain the difference of other non perturbative components ( 4.8% ) that the electron can detect , which shows that using muons and electrons as a probe will correspond to different proton radii .",
    "what s more , the mem can also be used for making theoretical predictions , estimate the radius of other hadrons , and get the proportion of the other non - perturbative components inside ."
