    "the purpose of the human motor system is to transform electro - chemical signals in the nervous system into physical movement .",
    "the dominant paradigm for studying the information capacity of the human motor system is based on the pioneering work by paul fitts in the 1950s  @xcite .",
    "its primary application is the analysis of user interfaces in human - computer interaction  @xcite ; it was , for instance , one of the main drivers in the development and adoption of the computer mouse  @xcite .",
    "fitts was interested in _ aimed movements _ ; i.e. , movement where a pointer ( finger , eye fixation , arm , mouse cursor etc . )",
    "is moved on top of a spatially expanded target .",
    "a common example is moving mouse cursor on top of a button on a computer display .",
    "fitts law describes the observation that the relationship between movement time @xmath0 and spatial characteristics of the required movement is characterized as : = a+b_2 ( 1+d w ) , [ eq : fitts ] where @xmath1 is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target and @xmath2 is the width of the target ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are empirical parameters determined by the task , the pointing device , and the performer .",
    "@xmath0 is typically measured in an empirical procedure involving rapid responses to spatial targets with experimenter - controlled characteristics .",
    "the information - theoretic basis of fitts law is centered around the tradeoff between the speed and accuracy of movements produced by the motor system . in information - theoretic terms , the _ capacity _ of the motor system as a channel of communication is limited by this tradeoff . since physical movements are naturally measured on a continuous ( spatial ) scale , the measurement of their information content must involve the determination of their accuracy or , as fitts points out ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  [ s]ince measurable aspects of motor responses , such as their force , direction , and amplitude , are continuous variables , their information capacity is limited only by the amount of statistical variability , or noise , that is characteristic of repeated efforts to produce the same response .",
    "  @xcite _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the information theoretic interpretation of fitts law @xcite , where information throughtput is formalized in terms of a standard gaussian channel , see  @xcite , has been immensely popular since it enables the comparison of performance across situations with different characteristics .",
    "the _ index of performance _ ( ip ) defines the information throughput in units of _ bits per second _ ( bps ) : = 1/b .",
    "[ eq : ip ] ip is argued to be a good metric because , as observed by fitts , and later many others , it tends to stay relatively constant over a broad range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite , providing a natural basis for comparison of pointing devices .",
    "the mouse , for example , typically reaches ca .",
    "4 bps , and joystick ca .  2 bps  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the present work is that important aspects of the information potential of human motor system are not covered by the fitts law paradigm , and that consequently , the capacity of human motor system is systematically underestimated  insofar as the said paradigm even attempts to estimate the capacity of the whole motor system .",
    "in fact , fitts law and its generalizations are constrained to _ aimed _ movements of one ( or few ) body part(s ) in target conditions that are _ prescribed _ to a high degree by the experimenter .",
    "this has three important implications .",
    "firstly , the `` information '' that is being measured is tantamount to the subject s ability to motorically conform to extrinsic constraints , excluding entirely free movement , i.e. , movement produced irrespective of its absolute position in respect to perceivable environmental constraints .",
    "such movements are important in many skilled activities , such as dance and sports .",
    "the issue of underestimation is exacerbated by the empirical paradigm , which utilizes very simple repetitive movements with simple trajectories ( see  @xcite . secondly , fitts law does not account for information in _ simultaneous movement of multiple body parts _ ( for an exception , see  @xcite ) .",
    "there are 640 muscles , 200 - 300 joints , and 206 bones in the human body .",
    "obviously we are not able to independently control each one of them , but some separation is possible ; for instance , the thumb and the index finger can be moved relatively independently of each other and the three other fingers  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , most skilled activities involve compound tasks , with multiple aimed and other types of movement performed simultaneously and sequentially . due to these three limitations",
    ", we argue that the fitts law paradigm is not suitable for the study of skilled motor action ; i.e. , precisely the ones that can be expected to contain the most information !    extending fitts definition , we define information capacity in terms of the ability to accurately _ reproduce any previously performed movement pattern_. an infant is a good example of _ low _ information capacity . at any moment in time",
    ", the infant s movement can appear complex , but the fact that he or she can not reproduce it at will means that the motor system lacks the information capacity to do so .",
    "our formulation is based on subjects performing arbitrarily complex un - prescribed movements ; fitts paradigm , involving only experimenter - defined pointing tasks , is a special case .",
    "the formulation can accommodate movement of any duration and composition and involving contributions of any part of the body .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : measure ] , we describe a measure of shared information between two movement sequences . the data and the preprocessing steps are detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , and the results of the experiments are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . to conclude , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we discuss potential applications and outline future work .",
    "to quantify the information capacity , it is necessary to separate the _ controlled _ aspects of the performed sequence of movements from the _ unintentional _ aspects that are unavoidably present in all motor responses .",
    "as discussed above , the strictly defined range of admissible performances in fitts paradigm has a similar function : it rules out apparently complex , uncontrolled ( random ) sequences of movements . instead of restricting the allowed movements",
    ", we propose to solve this task by having a sequence _ repeated _ as exactly as possible by the same subject .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain an estimate of the variability of the two patterns , and subtract the complexity ( entropy ) due to it from the total complexity of the repeated performance . in other words ,",
    "information is measured by two aspects of the performance : @xmath5 the complexity of a movement pattern , and @xmath6 the precision with which it can be repeated . to clarify , we let the _ complexity _ of a sequence be given by its entropy .      for simplicity , we start by treating the one - dimensional case where each movement sequence is characterized by a single measurement per time frame .",
    "let @xmath7 denote a sequence where @xmath8 gives the value of the measured feature at time @xmath9 .",
    "we start the sequence from @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 for notational convenience : the first two entries guarantee that an autoregressive model with a look - back ( lag ) of two steps can be fitted to exactly @xmath12 data points . similarly , we denote by @xmath13 another movement sequence of the same length as @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 follow a second - order autoregressive model @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real - valued parameters to be tuned using least squares .",
    "the second - order model accounts for the basic physical principle that once the movement vector ( including direction and velocity ) is specified , constant movement contains no information whatsoever .    the errors ( or _ innovations _",
    ") @xmath19 and @xmath20 are assumed to be zero mean gaussian random variates .",
    "since the two sequences are supposed to be repetitions of the same movement pattern , we let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be correlated with some correlation coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "the innovations for different time frames @xmath22 are assumed to be independent of each other .",
    "having fitted the parameters to observed sequences , we obtain the residuals @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the predicted values based on the least squares estimates @xmath26,@xmath27,@xmath28 and @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 , respectively . under the model  ( [ eq : lin1 ] ) , the ( differential ) entropy of each of the sequences can be estimated by plugging the residual variance into the familiar formula for the gaussian entropy ( see  @xcite ) : h ( ) _ 2 ( 2e _ ^2 ) , h ( ) _ 2 ( 2e _ ^2 ) , [ eq : gaussent ] where @xmath32 is the residual variance of @xmath14 and @xmath33 is defined similarly .    the mutual information between the movement sequences , which gives the reduction in bits in the entropy of one sequence when we are given the other , is now fully determined by the residuals , and in particular , their correlation @xmath34 : i ( ; ) = -n2 _ 2 ( 1-^2 ) .",
    "however , since we do not in general know the true correlation coefficient , we need to estimate it from the data .",
    "using the empirical correlation coefficient tends to underestimate the true value , and hence , our mutual information estimate based on it will tend to be too high .",
    "( for instance , even if the true correlation is zero , we will always get an estimate that is greater than zero . )",
    "there are various ways to compensate for this bias .",
    "we adopt an approach similar to rissanen s classic two - part approximation to the _ stochastic complexity _",
    "@xcite , whereupon the estimated mutual information becomes i ( ; ) = -n2 _ 2 ( 1-^2 ) - 12 _ 2 n , [ eq : muti ] where the last term will act to overcome the overestimation of the mutual information due to fitting the correlation parameter to a finite amount of data ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for many interesting properties of the stochastic complexity formula ; those familiar with the concept , may notice that our penalty term is equal to @xmath35 with @xmath36 parameters ) .",
    "the mutual information has a direct interpretation in terms of the reduction in _ bits _ required to encode the sequence @xmath14 due to the side information @xmath15 being available .",
    "since the mutual information in @xmath14 and @xmath15 excludes , with high probability , most of the uncontrolled movements and inaccuracies which tend not to be repeated when the movement is performed twice , we argue that it provides a measure of the controlled information in @xmath14 . to achieve high mutual information",
    ", a movement has to be both complex and accurately controlled so that it can be repeated with high precision .",
    "finally , we define the observed _ throughput _ in a sequence @xmath14 conditioned on sequence @xmath15 as the estimated mutual information per second : ( ) = r i ( ; ) n = -r2 _ 2 ( 1-^2 )",
    "- r 2n _ 2 n , [ eq : capa ] where @xmath37 denotes the frame rate ( frames per second ) .      when handling @xmath38-dimensional sequences , @xmath39 , where each time frame @xmath8 is composed of @xmath38 measured components ( features ) , @xmath40 , it is not sufficient to simply sum up the information throughput in each of the components separately .",
    "this would namely exaggerate the throughput as redundant information that is contained in more than one component was counted several times .    to reduce the effect of redundant information shared between features , we decorrelate the features . to this end",
    ", we first perform principal component analysis ( pca ) on movement sequence @xmath14 .",
    "we then transform both sequences to obtain two new time series , @xmath41 and @xmath42 where each frame in each sequence is obtained by a linear transformation ( the same one for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) of the corresponding frame in the original sequence .",
    "typically most of the variance in the new sequences is focused on a fraction of the principal components , and we retain only as many as are required to cover @xmath43 percent of the variance ( of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the newly obtained lower - dimensional sequences are then analysed using the technique described above , and the throughputs are summed up .",
    "( 1,.4 ) ( 0,.025 )       +",
    "in order to study unconstrained performances without limiting ourselves to specific tasks or parts of the body , we analyse motion capture data .",
    "motion capture data is typically obtained by recording a subject by a set of cameras , and using special - purpose image processing technologies to convert the recorded video into variables such as 3d coordinates or angles of joints ( wrists , elbows , shoulders , waist , knees , etc ) .",
    ".summary of the data used in the experiments . [ cols=\"^,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a sanity check , we also evaluated the throughput for pairs of sequences that were not repetitions of the same movement pattern . as expected , the obtained throughput values are all very small or even negative , in eq .  . in terms of the minimum description length ( mdl )",
    "principle  @xcite , this would be taken to indicate that a model where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are independent is superior to the model where they are correlated via the innovation sequences .",
    "note that this is equivalent to model selection using the bayesian information criterion ( bic )  @xcite . ] .",
    "the experiment we have described demonstrates the main idea in our framework , i.e. , extending the prevailing information - theoretic framework to allow completely unconstrained movements , and thereby , to determine the maximum of the achievable information capacity .",
    "motion capture data provides the best way to characterize such movements in a way that does not rule out any potentially informative aspects in them .",
    "that said , it will be interesting to compare the capacity estimates obtained by other methods , such as pointing devices ( the traditional tool in fitts paradigm ) , data gloves , etc . , and to see if the earlier results are replicated .",
    "for instance , it is interesting to see if more information can be extracted from fitts original reciprocal pointing task by recording the movements by a data glove or motion capture : the question is whether the path along which the hand operating the pointer moves between the two targets carries additional information beyond the information provided by the end - points , and if it does , how much .",
    "achieving the goal of constructing a complete and reliable measure of information capacity will lead to a wealth of useful knowledge about the human motor system .",
    "concrete utility is to be seen , for instance , in the study of novel human - computer interfaces that involve free whole - body expression .",
    "possible applications in sports science include training of complex motor schemas with reference models .",
    "potential new diagnostic tools based on monitoring changes in the information capacity of the motor system may offer great societal value through early identification of neurological disorders related to motor dysfunction and in monitoring recovery of neuroplasticity after lesions .",
    "we will explore these lines of research in further work .",

    "we also thank kristian lukander for several discussions on the measurement of information capacity , and daniel schmidt and petri lievonen for useful comments on an earlier draft of the paper .",
