    "the giant elliptical galaxy m87 hosts the best - known extragalactic jet . because of its proximity ( d=16 mpc ) and high surface brightness , in m87 we can study jet physics in far higher detail than is possible for any other source .    since its launch",
    ", hst has studied m87 in great detail .",
    "a comparison of the jet s radio and optical structure ( sparks et al .",
    "1996 ) finds remarkable large - scale similarity , but clear and significant differences appear on @xmath0 scales .",
    "the optical emission is more concentrated in knots and along the centerline , a trend which continues into the uv .",
    "all of the inner jet knots ( i.e. , interior to knot a ) , show apparent superluminal motion , with speeds ranging from @xmath1 ( biretta et al .",
    "the superluminal components vary significantly on 1 year timescales .    with this in mind , we discuss polarimetric and spectral index maps of the m87 jet .",
    "polarimetry is by far the most sensitive probe of a jet s structure , because it tracks directly the structure of the magnetic field in the emission regions .",
    "the comparison of polarized structures in radio and optical bands is a particularly powerful tool , as it allows us to see whether the magnetic fields in those regions have similar or different properties .",
    "spectral index images are equally powerful , as they allow us to view not only the spectrum of the emitted radiation , but also the underlying spectrum of the synchtron emitting particles .",
    "a comparison of spectral index maps in two bands can diagnose the structure of the jet and the presence of particle acceleration .    here",
    "we emphasize certain features in the polarization and spectral index images presented in perlman et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001 ) , and discuss in particular the inner jet . for more detailed discussions , the reader is directed to those papers .",
    "in figure 1 , we show a comparison of radio and optical polarimetry in the inner regions of the m87 jet .",
    "figure 2 compares the run of radio - optical and optical spectra with that of optical flux in these same regions .",
    "significant differences are evident in the optical and radio polarization structures of knots in the inner jet ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the polarization varies far more in the optical than it does in the radio , with the strongest variations near the flux maxima .",
    "the average optical polarization just upstream of the flux peak in hst-1 is @xmath2 , while at the maximum , @xmath3 drops to just @xmath4 . in d , e and f , @xmath3 values of @xmath5",
    "are observed just upstream of the flux peaks , compared with @xmath6 at the flux peaks . by comparison",
    ", @xmath7 drops from @xmath8 to 0.15 at the flux peak , a similarly small change is observed in f , and the drops in @xmath7 observed at the flux peaks of d and e are statistically insignificant .",
    "obvious differences in the magnetic field orientation are also observed .",
    "notably , at the upstream ends of knots hst-1 , d and f , the optical magnetic field position angle ( mfpa ) becomes nearly perpendicular to the jet , whereas the radio mfpa remains primarily along the jet axis in d and f.    0.15 in    we also see clear differences in these regions between variations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "much larger variations are observed in @xmath9 near flux maxima , than are seen in @xmath10 .",
    "bright regions of the knots have flatter @xmath9 , with particularly sharp variations in hst-1 and d. those same regions have much smoother variations in @xmath10 . also , @xmath9 and @xmath10 do not vary together in the knot regions . in two regions",
    ", @xmath9 appears to lead @xmath10 : knot hst-1 ( by @xmath11 ) and knot f ( by @xmath12 ) .",
    "but two other knots show just the opposite , with @xmath9 lagging @xmath10 : knot d ( by @xmath11 ) and knot e ( by @xmath13 ) in addition , the flat-@xmath10 regions are larger than the corresponding flat-@xmath9 regions , and significantly larger values of @xmath14 are observed immediately downstream of the flux maxima . but",
    "further downstream this steepening stops once the local mean in @xmath14 is reached .",
    "these data are hard to explain unless the jet is stratified , with high - energy electrons concentrated closer to the axis than lower - energy electrons ( perlman et al .",
    "shocks appear to originate in the high - energy emitting regions , and thus we see rotations of the optical mfpa just upstream of the flux maximum .",
    "but at knot maxima , we see enhanced emission from both the jet center and edge , such that the polarization vectors cancel out in the optical but not in the radio .",
    "this model also predicts the much narrower flat-@xmath9 regions that we see , and the relatively poor correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "given the perpendicular mfpas we observe , the knots posssess all the necessary ingredients for localized particle acceleration .",
    "evidence for particle acceleration can be seen in the run of @xmath9 ( figure 2 ) , which shows sharp flattenings beginning in the same regions where perpendicular mfpas are observed , and the flattest spectra coinciding with flux maxima .",
    "it is hard to explain the runs of @xmath9 and @xmath10 without invoking particle acceleration , because otherwise one would expect ( 1 ) no sharp variations in @xmath9 near flux maxima , ( 2 ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 should vary together , and ( 3 ) @xmath15 everywhere in the jet .",
    "particle acceleration can easily account for the long - standing discrepancy ( meisenheimer et al .",
    "1996 and refs . therein ) between the particle ages ( @xmath16 years ) and length of the jet ( 2 kpc ) , without requiring that the jet be as strongly out of equipartition as suggested by heinz & begelman ( 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , particle acceleration is expected in these knots if they are analogous to flaring regions in blazar jets .",
    "if particle acceleration is present , the runs of @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent a time history of particle acceleration and synchrotron aging . in two knots ( d - east and e )",
    ", we observe @xmath10 leading @xmath9 , while in two others ( hst-1 and f ) , the opposite is observed .",
    "both are consistent with models for flares produced by shock - induced particle acceleration . as kirk et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed , the evolution of spectral index in a given band during a flare depends on the relationship of the acceleration and cooling timescales @xmath17 and @xmath18 for electrons which emit in that band . where @xmath17 is much shorter than @xmath18 , higher - energy emissions should lead lower - energy emissions ( georganopoulous & marscher 1998 , takahashi et al .",
    "but if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are close to equal near the peak in @xmath19 , things are more complex . at low energies , where @xmath17 is much faster than @xmath18 ( n.b.,@xmath20 )",
    ", the spectrum should flatten in advance of the flux maximum , peaking slightly before flux maximum , followed by a steepening to values somewhat below the jet s nominal value after maximum flux , and then a return to the nominal value after the disturbance has passed .",
    "but at high energies , where @xmath21 , spectral _ steepening _ is predicted in advance of the flux maximum , followed by a hardening as the number of newly accelerated electrons build up . under this model",
    "( assuming no injection of fresh particles ) , flares represent the reacceleration of old particles within the jet , so they will propagate from low to high energies , _",
    "i.e. _ observed spectral changes at higher energies will lag those at lower energies .",
    "we appear to be observing _ both _ situations in different knot regions in the m87 jet ."
