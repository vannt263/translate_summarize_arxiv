    "the possibility of discovering the so called quark - gluon plasma at rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) or in the future lhc ( large hadron collider ) has triggered a lot of effort in the theoretical description of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the modern view of these collisions was set mainly by bjorken @xcite and it is based in the hydrodynamic model already considered by landau @xcite . in the last stages of the evolution of the central rapidity region the hadronic fluid",
    "is made mainly of pions .",
    "it has been argued that this expanding pion gas can reach thermal equilibrium much more efficiently than chemical equilibrium since at low energies pion interactions are mostly elastic @xcite . in order to have an appropriate phenomenological description of the expanding pion gas it is needed to set the proper hydrodynamic equations . in the pioneering work by bjorken",
    "the hadronic gas ( both in the confined and in the quark - gluon plasma phases ) was assumed to be a perfect relativistic fluid and accordingly viscosity and heat conductivity were neglected . in order to check the validity of this assumption in the different regimes of the pion gas expansion it is needed to compute the corresponding transport coefficients as a function of the temperature and density .",
    "this could make possible to know in what physical situations they are relevant and the ideal fluid equations are not appropriate any more .",
    "in addition the expressions obtained for these coefficients can be used to set the correct relativistic version of the navier - stokes equations which applies when dissipative effects must be taken into account in the pion fluid dynamics .",
    "curiously enough , the computation of these coefficients is also interesting from the fundamental point of view , since it can be done completely from first principles .",
    "in this work we will illustrate this by computing the viscosity of the pion gas at low energy and density .",
    "our computation will rely just in standard kinetic theory and the chiral symmetry properties of the strong interaction and thus our results can be considered model independent .",
    "in fact our results will depend only on the pion mass @xmath1 and the pion decay constant @xmath2 .",
    "the main points on which our computation is based are the following .",
    "first of all our computation is going to apply only at low temperature and density . at low temperatures hadronic matter is confined into hadrons and at very low temperatures the only excited modes are pions for vanishing barionic number @xmath3 density .",
    "notice that @xmath4 is supposed to be the case in the central rapidity region of heavy ion collisions .",
    "moreover the additional low - density condition allows us to consider the non barionic hadronic matter as a pion gas .    at low temperatures most of the pion interactions occur at low energies .",
    "the low energy pion interactions are completely determined by the chiral symmetry pattern of the strong interactions . in the chiral limit ( vanishing @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark masses )",
    "the strong interaction dynamics is invariant under the @xmath7 chiral transformations .",
    "however this symmetry is supposed to be spontaneously broken to the diagonal or isospin group @xmath8 , being the pions the corresponding goldstone bosons . in the real world",
    "quarks masses are different from zero and then this symmetry breaking pattern is not exact resulting in a small value ( when compared with other hadrons ) for the pion mass @xmath1 . in any case",
    "chiral symmetry determines completely the low energy pion interactions in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath2 ( weinberg low energy theorems ) .",
    "the corrections appearing at higher energies can be computed in a systematic way by means of chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in the chiral limit the pion scattering amplitude goes to zero in the low energy limit .",
    "out of the chiral limit it is proportional to @xmath10 . in any case",
    "the interaction is small in this regime .",
    "therefore we arrive to the conclusion that non barionic hadronic matter at low temperature and density can be described as a weakly interacting pion gas .",
    "another important observation is that at low temperatures ( energies ) most of the pion collisions are elastic .",
    "this fact implies in particular that the number of pions is conserved .",
    "thus it is possible to introduce the corresponding pion chemical potential @xmath11 ( not to be confused with the more usual chemical potential associated to the barionic number ) .",
    "this makes it possible to consider the pion gas at thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath12 for different values of the chemical potential @xmath11 , or what it is the same , different pion densities , and not only the case of chemical equilibrium corresponding to @xmath13 .",
    "according to the previous discussion the simplest state for non barionic hadronic matter at low temperatures and densities is just a gas of weakly interacting pions in thermal equilibrium which could be described in a first approximation with a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "in addition , at very low temperatures the average pion energy is much smaller than the pion mass allowing for to have a non relativistic description of the pion gas .",
    "as discussed later , the low density condition will prevent the formation of the bose - einstein condensate out of the pions , thus making the description of the hadronic matter in the mentioned regime especially simple .",
    "more generally it is possible to consider the case when the equilibrium is only local . in this case",
    "the temperature , density ( or pion chemical potential ) and the overall velocity are space - time functions .",
    "in this situation it is possible to have an hydrodynamic description of the system as that considered in the bjorken picture of heavy ion collisions .",
    "a departure from local equilibrium will give rise to dissipative processes like viscosity , which is the main topic of this work .",
    "the evolution of the distribution functions outside equilibrium can be studied by using the uehling - uhlenbeck equation , which is the quantum version of the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "the computation of the transport coefficients such as viscosity or heat conductivity requires the solution of the transport equation for different specific perturbations of the local equilibrium distribution .",
    "as it was mentioned above , in this work we are interested in the computation of the viscosity of the hadronic fluid with the approximations discussed in the previous paragraphs .",
    "in fact it is possible to have a good estimation of this magnitude by neglecting quantum effects . in this case",
    "the equilibrium distribution function is just the boltzmann distribution instead the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "moreover the elastic scattering pion cross section is constant at low energies and as we will see it is given by @xmath14 in addition , at low temperatures we can use the non relativistic approximation so that our problem is equivalent to the classical computation of the viscosity of a gas of hard spheres of radius @xmath15 so that @xmath16 . by using the well known result in this case ( see for instance @xcite ) we find the viscosity to be given by @xmath17 this formula provides a nice estimation of the viscosity of the pion gas .",
    "however it does not take into account any quantum effect that can be important at low temperatures .",
    "in addition it does not include any dependence in the pion chemical potential , i.e. in the pion density .",
    "in the following we will show how these effects can be properly taken into account to find the pion gas viscosity in terms of the temperature and chemical potential ( or density ) in the low temperature and density regime at the leading order .",
    "we will also estimate the magnitude of the next to leading corrections .",
    "the plan of the paper goes as follows : in sec.2 we review the main equations of the non - relativistic ideal pion gas to set the notation and for further reference . in sec.3",
    "we describe briefly the fundamentals of the kinetic theory needed to follow the present work and in sec.4 we show how the hydrodynamic equations emerge from it . in sec.5",
    "we obtain the equations for the transport coefficients in terms of the appropriate solutions of the linearized transport equations .",
    "in sec.6 we simplify these equations to write them in useful form for finding explicit formulae for the viscosity .",
    "in sec.7 we give the cross - section for the low energy elastic pion scattering obtained from the lowest order chiral perturbation theory .",
    "in sec.8 we obtain the lowest order terms of the pion gas viscosity . in sec.9",
    "we show our numerical results and discuss the magnitude of the next to leading corrections and in sec.10 we set the main conclusions of our work .",
    "finally in the appendix we study the properties of the polynomials introduced in this work that play a role similar to the standard sonine polynomials in the more familiar classic computations .",
    "in this section we review briefly the equation of state of a free non - relativistic bosonic gas , which will provide our description of the pion gas at low temperature and density . as it is well known @xcite , for a large volume the pressure can be written as @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{g t}{v}\\log\\left[1-e^{\\beta\\mu}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the number of pions @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the temperature , @xmath22 is the volume , @xmath11 is the pion chemical potential and @xmath23 is the energy of a non relativistic pions in terms of the momentum i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the number density or the number of pions per unit of volume is given by @xmath26 where the last term is the number of pions with zero momentum per unit of volume .",
    "when this term is not negligible it is responsible for the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we thus define @xmath27 clearly the above equations make sense only when the chemical potential satisfies @xmath28 . as a consequence , in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath29 with @xmath30 constant , we find two phases : in the first one ( normal phase ) @xmath28 and @xmath31 .",
    "however if we lower the temperature , keeping a fixed density , @xmath11 increases until @xmath32 . at that point @xmath33 and",
    "the ground state density starts to grow forming the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "eventually , at @xmath34 , all pions are in the ground state so that @xmath35 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath36 where the phase transition occurs can be found to be @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the riemann @xmath39 function evaluated at @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the critical temperature can be made arbitrary small by lowering the density . in this work",
    "we are interested in the the low temperature and the low density regime . in order to simplify the analysis we will not consider the contribution of the condensate . thus for a given temperature @xmath12",
    ", we will always assume that the density will be low enough so that @xmath40 and no significant fraction of pions will have zero momentum ( see @xcite for a discussion of the pion condensate ) .    in the following it",
    "will also be convenient to introduce the fugacity @xmath41 and then the above equations for the density and the pressure can be written as @xmath42 and @xmath43 introducing the variable @xmath44 we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 where the integrals can be written in terms of the @xmath47 functions @xcite as @xmath48 with @xmath49 so that @xmath50 and @xmath51 therefore we have for a non relativistic free pion gas at equilibrium at low temperature and density @xmath52 and @xmath53 thus the equation of state can be written as @xmath54",
    "the possibility of having an hydrodynamic description of the pion gas requires the definition of macroscopic fields such as the velocity @xmath55 , the pressure @xmath56 , the number density @xmath57 , the temperature @xmath58 and others . in other words",
    ", it is needed to have a large number of pions in each volume element @xmath59 . the statistical description of the gas is based on the ( one - particle ) distribution function @xmath60 which gives the number of pions inside the phase - space volume element @xmath61 at the instant @xmath62 . in fact",
    "the phase - space volume element is given by @xmath63 but in the case considered here the difference amounts to a constant factor which we include in the definition of the distribution function @xmath64 .",
    "thus the total number of pions will be given by @xmath65 as we are interested here in the behaviour of the pion gas at low temperatures and densities , most of the the pion interactions will occur at low energies .",
    "then the pion - pion interactions will be essentially elastic and the total number of pions will be a conserved quantity .",
    "this in particular means that it makes sense to introduce the chemical potential @xmath66 related with the pion number even in presence of low - energy pion interactions .",
    "the evolution of the distribution function is determined by the bbkgy hierarchy ( from n.n .",
    "bogoliubov , m. born , g. kirkwood , h.s .",
    "green and j. yvon ) @xcite .",
    "this is a set of @xmath67 coupled equations for the @xmath68-particle distribution functions @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "however , for low - density gases it can be a good approximation to truncate the bbkgy hierarchy .",
    "for example by using the bogoliubov ansatz , i.e. by writing the two - particle function in terms of an appropriate product of two one - particle functions ( molecular chaos hypothesis ) , it is possible to decouple the first bbkgy equation from the others to obtain the well known boltzmann equation .",
    "this equation was modified by uehling and uhlenbeck in order to include the quantum statistic effects ( see for example @xcite ) . for the bosonic case the uehling - uhlenbeck equation reads @xmath71\\ ] ] where @xmath72=\\int d \\vec v_2 d \\sigma u \\left[f'_1f'_2\\left(1+\\frac{f_1}{a}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{f_2 } { a}\\right)\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ \\left .",
    "- f_1f_2\\left(1+\\frac{f'_1 } { a}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{f'_2 } { a}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the collision term or collision functional .",
    "the above equation describes the irreversible space - time evolution of the ( one - point ) distribution function @xmath64 , being this irreversible behaviour a consequence of the truncation of the bbkgy hierarchy . as usual",
    "we use for short the notation @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is the differential cross - section corresponding to the elastic scattering of two pions with initial and final velocities @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the relative velocity of the initial particles @xmath79 and , finally , the normalization constant @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 .",
    "as it is the case of the boltzmann equation , the uehling - uhlenbeck equation typically drives the gas from arbitrary initial distributions to the equilibrium distribution @xmath82 which is a fixed point of this equation in the sense that the collision functional vanishes on it @xmath83=0\\ ] ] for a gas moving at a macroscopic velocity @xmath84 the equilibrium distribution corresponding to temperature @xmath12 and pion chemical potential @xmath11 is given by @xmath85 from which the properties of free pion gas given in the previous section can be derived .",
    "the case of local equilibrium is also described by this distribution but having the @xmath86 and @xmath11 parameters depending on the position and time .",
    "this case corresponds to an ideal fluid .",
    "however , in order to describe dissipative processes , such as viscosity or thermal conduction , it is needed to consider the case where the pion gas is not even in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "given some magnitude @xmath87 it is possible to compute its statistic average by using the distribution function as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the pion number density .",
    "this average can be understood as the corresponding macroscopic magnitude in the hydrodynamic approach @xcite .",
    "for example , the macroscopic fluid velocity @xmath84 is given by @xmath90 the equation governing the evolution of any of these magnitudes ( transport equations ) can be obtained by multiplying @xmath91 by the uehling - uhlenbeck equation and then integrating @xmath92 so that    @xmath93    the r.h.s .",
    "term can be written in a more symmetric fashion as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is defined through the relation    @xmath96    from this form of the collision terms it becomes apparent than it vanishes for any quantity @xmath87 which is conserved in the collision such as the total energy or momentum . on the other hand , by using the definition of statistical average , the first term of ( [ 21 ] ) can be written as : @xmath97 thus for conserved magnitudes this term vanishes . in order to find the basic hydrodynamic equations it is useful to write the velocity as @xmath98 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath99 is the pion velocity relative to the macrocopic velocity @xmath84 and therefore it averages to zero . choosing @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( corresponding to the conservation of a constant , the mumentum and the energy in the elastic collision ) we obtain the equations    @xmath102    in order to understand the meaning of the above equations we can introduce the following macroscopic quantities : @xmath103 is the pressure tensor",
    ", @xmath104 is the internal energy density and @xmath105 is the energy ( heat ) flux . due to the isotropy of the pion fluid",
    "the pressure tensor can be taken as diagonal , i.e. @xmath106 . in this case @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "thus , ( by taking @xmath109 but not its derivatives , which can always be done ) we arrive to the standard ideal fluid equations , namely the continuity equation @xmath110 the euler equation @xmath111 and the energy conservation equation @xmath112 in spite of the above equations for the ideal fluid , it is well established that an irreversible flux of energy and momentum appear in an inhomogeneous gas .",
    "this flux gives rise to the well known dissipative processes of thermal and conduction and viscosity .",
    "for example an small gradient of temperature produces a heat flow which in a first approximation can be written as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a coefficient called thermal conductivity . in order to include momentum diffusion effects",
    "we add an extra term to the isotropic pressure tensor : @xmath115 the requirement for this tensor to vanish for uniform translations and rotations of the fluid , makes it possible to write it to first order in the velocity derivatives as @xmath116 thus it is needed to introduce two coefficients @xmath117 and @xmath39 which are usually called first and second viscosity coefficients .",
    "the introduction of the dissipative effects does not modify the continuity equation .",
    "however the euler equation becomes    @xmath118\\ ] ]    which is known as the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the energy conservation equation is in this case @xmath119\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus the description of the dissipative flow of energy and momentum requires the introduction of three transport coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , for an incompressible fluid the second ( shear ) viscosity does not play any role . in the following",
    "we will assume that this is the case for the pion gas considered here .",
    "as it has been mentioned above the description of the dissipative processes requires going beyond local equilibrium .",
    "thus , in order to compute the transport coefficients we have to consider a distribution function @xmath64 slightly perturbed from the equilibrium distribution @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath121 where @xmath122 is an arbitrary function of the velocities which represents the inhomogeneous contribution to the distribution function . this contribution will be assumed to be small in the sense that @xmath123 , since we are interested only in the computation of the transport coefficients .",
    "the @xmath122 function must by determined by solving the uehling - uhlenbeck equation which can be linearized with respect to @xmath122 .",
    "then it is possible to compute the transport coefficients from this function .",
    "for example , the heat flux can be written as @xmath124 taking into account that this flux vanishes for an homogeneous gas and using the definition of the heat conductivity we have @xmath125 now it is useful to write the @xmath122 function as @xmath126 therefore @xmath127 with the tensor conductivity @xmath128 being given by @xmath129 for an isotropic gas @xmath130 so that , we have the following equation for the heat conductivity @xmath131 in a similar way it is possible to write the viscosity in terms of an @xmath132 function . in order to do that we write the pressure tensor in terms of the distribution function @xmath133 for the present calculation it is enough to consider the case @xmath109 ( but not its derivatives ) .",
    "then the non isotropic component of the pressure tensor can be written as @xmath134 on the other hand for an incompressible fluid this tensor is @xmath135 where we have introduced @xmath136 @xmath137 .",
    "for further convenience we choose the perturbation to have the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a microscopic velocity dependent quantity which can be written as @xmath140 therefore , by equating the two forms of @xmath141 we find @xmath142 where @xmath143 ( the viscosity tensor ) is given by @xmath144 due to the several symmetries of this tensor it can written as @xmath145 so that we have @xmath146 as the @xmath132 function depends only on the velocity modulus it is possible to perform the angular integrations @xmath147 in the following it will be useful to consider @xmath132 as a function of the adimensional variable @xmath148 , i.e. @xmath149 defined as @xmath150 at this point it is customary to develop the @xmath151 in terms of the sonine polynomials",
    ". however it is more appropriate in our case to introduce a new family of orthogonal polynomials @xmath152 since we are considering the uehling - uhlenbeck as the transport equation ( i.e. we have taken into account quantum effects ) instead of the more common boltzmann equation .",
    "the definition and the main properties of this new polynomials can be found in appendix a. in terms of @xmath153 the @xmath132 function can be written as @xmath154 therefore @xmath155 and the distribution function as @xmath156 for all the families of polynomials , i.e. , for all the @xmath157 values , we have exact conservation of the collision invariants .",
    "this fact makes possible to choose @xmath157 so that we get the simplest integral .",
    "the appropriate value turns out to be @xmath158 and then we get @xmath159 in this way the computation of the viscosity of the pion gas has been reduced to the computation of the @xmath160 coefficient .",
    "as discussed above the the perturbed distribution function must be a solution of the uehling - uhlenbeck equation ( [ estado1 ] ) . in order to solve this equation",
    "it is quite convenient to write the l.h.s . in terms of macroscopic quantities , as the temperature , velocity , density and fugacity , and their derivatives .",
    "this can be done by using the equation of state and the hydrodynamic equations as follows : first of all at lowest order we have    @xmath161    thus the temporal derivative is @xmath162 where the energy @xmath163 is given by @xmath164 so that we have @xmath165 in a similar way we can obtain @xmath166 thus we have @xmath167 here it is possible to use the state equation for the free pion gas and the ideal fluid equations ( euler , continuity and energy conservation ) to find @xmath168\\ ] ] on the other hand , substituting expression ( [ ligin ] ) into ( [ colision1 ] ) , expanding to first order in the perturbation @xmath122 and taking benefit from the equilibrium distribution function relation @xmath169 we obtain @xmath170\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath171 and the @xmath172 symbol is defined as @xmath173\\equiv f \\left(x_1'\\right)+f\\left(x_2'\\right)-f\\left(x_1\\right)-f\\left(x_2\\right ) \\\\ ] ] thus the whole collision term can be written as @xmath174= \\frac { 1 } { a^2t}\\int d \\vec v_2 d \\sigma\\ u\\ z^{-2}\\exp\\left({e / t}\\right)f_1f_2f_1'f_2'\\delta \\left[\\chi\\left(1-z\\exp\\left(-\\frac{e } { t}\\right)\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] where we have omitted the superindex @xmath175 in the equilibrium distribution function . in this way",

    "thus , in particular , we have @xmath179",
    "in order to solve the above transport equation it is needed to know the differential cross section for pion scattering . as we are interested in the low energy regime the most appropriate approach is the chiral perturbation theory which relies in the chiral symmetry pattern of the strong interactions . in particular",
    "it is quite useful the chiral lagrangian approach suggested by weinberg and extended up to the one loop level by gasser and leutwyler .",
    "this chiral lagrangian approach consists in a systematic expansion on the pion field derivatives and the pion mass which are considered to be of the same order . from the lowest order of this expansion ,",

    "therefore , at very low energies the elastic pion scattering cross section can be considered as a constant , so that it is formally equivalent to the elastic scattering of rigid spheres of radius @xmath216 after the manipulations described below the r.h.s of the transport equation can be written the collision term as @xmath217 where we have defined    @xmath218 \\delta\\left[\\left(v_kv_l-\\frac{1 } { 3}\\delta_{kl } v^2\\right)\\left(1-ze^{-v^2}\\right)p_{5/2}^t\\left(z;v^2\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then the transport equation ( [ ultima ] ) can be written as @xmath219 therefore by defining @xmath220 the viscosity is given by @xmath221 where @xmath222 is a solution of the equation system @xmath223 or @xmath224 in order to find the leading contribution to the viscosity we can truncate the above system to find @xmath225 in this way the calculation of the viscosity have been reduced to the computation of the integral @xmath226 .",

    "thus it is possible , at least in principle , to find the viscosity as a function of the temperature @xmath12 and the fugacity @xmath204 ( or the pion chemical potential ) .",
    "alternatively it is also possible to find the viscosity as a function of the temperature and the pion number density . due to the complicated integrals appearing in the definition of the @xmath227 functions it has been possible to get numerical results only by monte carlo @xcite integration . for the sake of simplicity",
    "most of these numerical results have been obtained by using the approximation of ( [ approx ] ) and the hard sphere cross section of ( [ sigma0 ] ) . in order to check the validity of these approximations",
    "we have computed the @xmath228 matrix containing the first @xmath227 functions for the particular value @xmath229 .",
    "the result and the corresponding errors is    @xmath230    now we consider the submatrices @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 and solve the corresponding system for the appropriate number of @xmath235 so that we can check the convergence of the results as the size of the truncation is increased .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 . there",
    "we see that the error is of the order of 1.6 %    0.3 cm    0.5 cm    to take into account the velocity effects in the cross section we will consider ( [ sigma ] ) instead of ( [ sigma0 ] ) in the computation of the @xmath236 integrals",
    ". then we will have @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the leading term corresponding to the hard sphere approximation and @xmath239\\right)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at the zero order in the sense of the previous table we have @xmath240 which at low temperatures can be written as @xmath241 so that @xmath242 this formula can be applied provided @xmath243 after a numerical integration we find , for @xmath229 , @xmath244 . by comparison with our previous result @xmath245",
    "we get the upper bound for the temperature @xmath246 which means that the hard sphere approximation is safe provided the temperature is much smaller than the @xmath247 of the pion mass . as we are working in a non relativistic framework this will always be the case and then no additional constrain on the applicability of our results is coming from the hard sphere approximation .",
    "therefore in the following we will work at zero order and in the hard sphere approximation . in this case",
    "the viscosity is given by @xmath248 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] some numerical results obtained from this formula are found in table 2 for different values of the fugacity @xmath204 .",
    "0.3 cm    0.5 cm the classical case is just the limit of @xmath204 going to zero .",
    "this corresponds to a classical gas of hard spheres of radious @xmath216    because of the particular way we have performed our computations the particular case @xmath249 is not numerically accessible .",
    "however this case has been treated long time ago and it is possible to find an analytic result for the viscosity , namely @xmath250    thus we can check that our computations have the proper @xmath249 limit . in fig.1",
    "we show the behaviour of @xmath251 and the viscosity , for constant @xmath12 , in terms of the fugacity . from this plots",
    "we learn that the viscosity of the bosonic quantum gas is smaller than that of the classical gas .",
    "this could be expected because of the following heuristic argument : after some elastic collision the emerging particles have more affinity for occupied states than classical ones",
    ". therefore the microscopic transfer of momentum is more effective in a classical gas than in a bosonic gas and then the viscosity is also larger .",
    "a pictorial view of this fact is displayed in fig.2 .    in many cases",
    "it is useful to have the viscosity as a function of the temperature and the density instead of the temperature and the fugacity .",
    "the pionic density can be written in terms of the temperature and the fugacity as @xmath252 this equation defines also implicitly the fugacity as a function of the density and the temperature @xmath253 .",
    "however , due to the complexities of the above integral this functions have only been computed numerically .",
    "in fig.4 we plot @xmath254 as a function of @xmath255 .",
    "the computed points can be fitted quite well in the plotted range with a polynomial @xmath256 with constants @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "thus the function obtained ( fig.3 ) for the viscosity versus the temperature and the density is    @xmath260\\ ] ]    as it may be noticed in fig.4 , the values of the viscosity cover the range from @xmath261 to @xmath262 for the considered densities and temperatures .",
    "in this work we have computed the viscosity of the pion gas , starting from first principles only .",
    "this computation is relevant for the hydrodynamic description of hadronic matter at low energies and densities .",
    "the work relies on the use of the uehling - uhlenbeck equation , which is the quantum version of the boltzmann equation , and chiral symmetry , which determines completely the structure of the pion interactions at low energies .",
    "we have also found a formula for the viscosity in terms of the temperature and the density which properly fits our numerical results .",
    "the interest of the computations is twofold .",
    "first it is useful to check when the usual assumption of perfect fluid for the hadronic fluid is reasonable enough .",
    "second it can be used to include the viscosity in the navier - stokes equations when dissipative effects can not be neglected .",
    "the main limitation of our work is that it can be applied only in the non - relativistic domain . as a consequence of that it can not be used directly in the study of the events observed in the modern ultra relativistic heavy ion colliders such as rhic or the future lhc . in any case",
    "we understand that our work is interesting in order to show that the computations of transport coefficients of the pion gas can be done in a complete model independent way .",
    "in fact we consider that the result presented here is just the first step of a complete relativistic computation which could be applied at higher energies and therefore in more realistic situations , to improve the standard hydrodynamic description of hadronic matter .",
    "work is in progress in that direction .",
