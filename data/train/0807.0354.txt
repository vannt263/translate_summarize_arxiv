    "adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite is a promising paradigm of quantum computation because of its robustness @xcite , and its intuitive mapping from np - complete and np - hard problems to potentially realizable hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "adiabatic quantum computing is attractive because relevant optimization problems such as lattice models for protein folding can be readily formulated @xcite .",
    "aqc algorithms involve the specification of a time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath0 this hamiltonian has three important functions : ( 1 ) the initial hamiltonian , @xmath1 , encodes a ground state that is easy to prepare and that is used as the initial state for the quantum evolution .",
    "( 2 ) the driving hamiltonian , @xmath2 , is responsible for mediating the transformation of the initial ground state to any of other state . (",
    "3 ) the final hamiltonian , @xmath3 , is problem dependent and its ground state encodes the solution , @xmath4 , to the computational problem . in the ideal case of a process being",
    "fully adiabatic , evolution under @xmath5 will keep the quantum state , @xmath6 , in the ground state of @xmath5 throughout @xmath7 . if this condition is met , the final state at @xmath8 should coincide with the ground state of the final hamiltonian , @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 , if the process is adiabatic .",
    "the measurement at @xmath8 will provide the solution to the computational problem .    since the original proposal by farhi et al @xcite ,",
    "a significant amount of progress has been made towards the design of final hamiltonians for different computationally intractable problems such as np - complete problems .",
    "for example , in this paper we provide a detailed description of the construction of final hamiltonian for the 3-sat problem . in previous work",
    ", we described the respective construction of the final hamiltonian for an np - hard problem of interest in biology , the protein folding problem , which consists of finding the minimum energy configuration of a chain of interacting amino acids in a lattice @xcite .",
    "several choices for @xmath11 have been suggested .",
    "farhi et al @xcite proposed what we call in this work the conventional form used for @xmath2 : a linear ramp , @xmath12 in farhi _",
    "et al _ s scheme the term @xmath13 can be defined as @xmath14 , namely , the term @xmath15 serves as the initial hamiltonian @xmath16 when its intensity is completely turned on at @xmath17 , and drives the quantum evolution until it is completely turned off at @xmath8 .",
    "the final hamiltonian is turned on with the functional form @xmath18 .",
    "scheduling the adiabatic evolution with this linear interpolation is not compulsory , thus different proposals have been studied such as the use of non - linear time - profile for auxiliary hamiltonians @xcite and optimal geodesic paths @xcite .    the question of whether aqc , or in general quantum computers , can be used for efficiently solving np - complete problems is a difficult open question .",
    "lessons that have been learned @xcite include that a poor choice of the initial hamiltonian such as the one - dimensional projector as selected in refs . @xcite and @xcite , will lead inefficient aqc algorithms . therefore , it is important to consider different strategies which might allow an escape from bottlenecks or trap states which might limit the use of aqc @xcite .    when attempting to tackle combinatorial and optimization problems with classical computers , a common approach to cope with intractability and np - complete problems @xcite , is to employ heuristic algorithms as an alternative to exhaustive search which scales exponentially with system size . in quantum computation ,",
    "hogg @xcite introduced heuristic techniques in quantum algorithms .",
    "he showed that using information about the structure of the problem as a heuristic guide can be used to enhance the performance of quantum search compared to the scheme proposed by grover @xcite .",
    "hogg s proposal was suggested for the gate model for quantum computation , but to our knowledge , there are no studies of heuristics in aqc .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the following questions : how can we incorporate heuristics in aqc ?",
    "is there any advantage by doing so ?",
    "what are the modifications to caqc proposal from an algorithmic and experimental point of view ?",
    "[ [ initial - state - selection . ] ] initial state selection .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the simplest form of heuristics we could think of is to start the quantum evolution from a quantum state which is a guess to the solution , but this possibility is not available in any of the proposals for aqc .",
    "physical intuition as well as constraints within the problem can be used to make an educated guess . to illustrate our idea ,",
    "let s use a lattice model for protein folding @xcite as an example .",
    "for this model , an educated guess for the initial state would be to choose a bit string which encodes an initial position for the amino acids in the spatial lattice such that no two amino acids are on top of each other , and that they are connected according to the sequence defining the protein to be folded .",
    "conversely , caqc would begin the computation with a quantum superposition of all possible states of the computational basis .",
    "this choice of initial state contains absurd configurations like all amino acids on top of each other , or assignments referring to configurations of amino acids which are fully disconnected or not properly linked according to the protein sequence .",
    "we conjecture here that the presence of these `` non - sensical '' states might act as trap states , making a smooth transition towards the desired final ground state more difficult and therefore increasing the time required for an adiabatic evolution . in other fields of computer science , physics and chemistry",
    ", one might also use classical methods or a mean field approach to find approximate solutions to be employed as educated guesses .",
    "for example , in the context of quantum simulation , a hartree - fock solution may be used as the initial state for an adiabatic preparation of an exact molecular wave function @xcite .",
    "in quantum mechanics , preparing a desired state is not a trivial task @xcite and it is not always possible to deterministically prepare a state from a superposition state by measurement . for np - complete classical problems , like the 3-satisfiability problem ( 3-sat )",
    "@xcite studied here , the simplest guess for the initial state is that of choosing one of the possible assignments from the solution space .",
    "we present a strategy which allows to design experimentally - realizable initial hamiltonians whose ground state corresponds to the desired guess as the initial quantum state .",
    "this is essential for studying the importance of choosing a guess state instead of having full superposition of states as in caqc @xcite . in an algorithm like the one proposed here , both the initial guess and the final solution will be states of the computational basis",
    "therefore , the overlap between them is zero , unless one has guessed the right solution or the guess is included in the subspace of solutions , which is very unlikely .",
    "regardless of this counterintuitive choice , @xmath19 , we show that using this kind of heuristics can be of advantage . even in the case of choosing the initial state by random guessing",
    "there is potential for outperforming caqc .",
    "[ [ restarting - the - evolution . ] ] restarting the evolution .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    notice that the method described here not only allows to begin the evolution from a guess state , but also allows for the possibility of restarting a failed aqc calculation from the measured state .",
    "this state can be used as a refined guess to restart the adiabatic evolution .",
    "an adiabatic processes is an idealized concept because real experiments have to be run in finite time and therefore there will always be probability of measuring a non - desired excited state which does not encode the solution to the computational task .",
    "the possibility of restarting the quantum evolution using the measured state as a guess is a feature which is not available in any of the aqc proposals to date , to our knowledge .",
    "the incorporation of heuristics in aqc essentially involves two modifications to caqc .",
    "we address both changes ; the first modification involves the design of initial hamiltonians for arbitrary guess states .",
    "the second modifications involves the change of the time profile of the driving hamiltonian from the linear ramp to a non - linear time dependence with a  sombrero - like \" time profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tradit - vs - sombrero ] ) . note that this second change is *",
    "not * the main point of the paper since non - linear paths had been proposed before @xcite .",
    "also , it is not our purpose to explore what is the optimal selection for the driving term .",
    "it must be emphasized that the  sombrero - like \" time profile is an essential feature needed if one is interested in the kind of heuristics we describe here , but this is not the case in the conventional way of doing aqc where it was used for auxiliary hamiltonian terms @xcite . because of this distinctive feature and with the purpose of differentiating our heuristic strategy proposed with caqc , we will refer to our method as sombrero adiabatic quantum computation ( saqc ) .",
    "the name should be associated with the algorithmic strategy ( selection of initial guess , design of initial hamiltonian and sombrero - like profile for the driving hamiltonian ) which aims to incorporate heuristics in aqc , not only to the use of non - linear paths in aqc .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section  [ sec : caqc ] , we review the caqc approach .",
    "section  [ sec : saqc ] introduces the basic elements of the new implementation , saqc .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : numresults ] , we present numerical calculations comparing the performance of both the caqc and the saqc algorithms based on the minimum gap , @xmath20 , of their respective time - dependent hamiltonians driving their corresponding time evolutions .",
    "the goal of aqc algorithms is that of transforming an initial ground state @xmath21 into a final ground state @xmath22 , which encodes the answer to the problem .",
    "this is achieved by evolving the corresponding physical system according to the schrdinger equation with a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "the aqc algorithm relies on the quantum adiabatic theorem @xcite , which states that if the quantum evolution is initialized with the ground state of the initial hamiltonian , the time propagation of this quantum state will remain very close to the instantaneous ground state @xmath24 for all @xmath25 $ ] , whenever @xmath23 varies slowly throughout the propagation time @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "this holds under the assumption that the ground state manifold does not cross the energy levels which lead to excited states of the final hamiltonian . here",
    ", we denote by ground state manifold the first @xmath26 curves associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the time - dependent hamiltonian for @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 is the degeneracy of the final hamiltonian ground state .",
    "an example of @xmath27 , is shown in fig . 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "conventionally the adiabatic evolution path is the linear sweep of @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 : @xmath30 @xmath31 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : hamilt_perturbation ] below ) is usually chosen such that its ground state is a uniform superposition of all possible @xmath32 computational basis vectors , for the case of an @xmath33qubit system . here",
    ", we choose the spin states \\{@xmath34 } , which are the eigenvectors of @xmath35 with eigenvalues + 1 and -1 , respectively , as the basis vectors .",
    "then the initial ground state is @xmath36 .",
    "such an initial ground state is usually assumed to be easy to prepare , for example , by imposing a global transverse field . since each state",
    "encodes a possible solution , this initial state assigns equal probability to all possible solutions to the computational problem .",
    "for saqc , the time - dependent hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath37    we want the non - degenerate ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath38 to encode a guess to the solution , and the driving term , @xmath39 , to couple the states in the computational basis .",
    "the function @xmath40 is zero at the beginning and end of the adiabatic path ; therefore @xmath39 acts only in the range @xmath41 in a `` sombrero - like '' time dependence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tradit - vs - sombrero ] ) , which allows @xmath16 ( @xmath42 ) to be fully turned on at the beginning ( end ) of the computation .          as preparing an arbitrary initial non - degenerate ground state for adiabatic evolution is not a trivial task , we focus on easy to prepare initial guesses that consist of one of the states in the computational basis .",
    "the strategy proposed builds initial hamiltonians such that the initial guess corresponds to the non - degenerate ground state of the initial hamiltonian , as it is required by aqc .",
    "additionally , this ground state would be non - degenerate .",
    "let us denote the states of the computational basis of an @xmath43 qubit system as @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the proposed initial hamiltonian , whose ground state corresponds to an arbitrary initial guess state of the form @xmath46 , can be written as    @xmath47    where each @xmath48 is a boolean variable , @xmath49 , while @xmath50 is a quantum operator acting on the @xmath51-th qubit of the multipartite hilbert space @xmath52 .",
    "the operator @xmath53 is given by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is placed in the @xmath51th position and the identity operators act on the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "the states constituting the computational basis , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , are eigenvectors of @xmath58 with eigenvalues @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and therefore they are also eigenstates of the operator @xmath55 with eigenvalues 0 and 1 respectively . the logic behind the initial hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ h - initial ] then is clear : if @xmath61 , then @xmath62 but in the case of @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .    as an example , suppose one has a four qubit system , and one wishes to initialize the adiabatic computation with the state @xmath65 which one may choose either randomly or as an educated guess to the solution . according to eq .",
    "[ h - initial ] , the initial hamiltonian for the @xmath66 guess state should be constructed as    @xmath67    and , clearly    @xmath68    in general , the @xmath69 states of the computational basis are all eigenstates of @xmath38 , and it can be easily verified that the spectrum of @xmath38 are energies contained in @xmath70 . as required , the ground state is also nondegenerate .",
    "the other states will have an eigenenergy which equals their hamming distance to the ground state of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "the encoding of an educated or a random guess into @xmath71 ( eq . [ h - initial ] ) makes both @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( eq . [ eq : sombrero - aqc ] ) diagonal in the computational basis .",

    "there is plenty of room to optimize the performance by choosing a more convenient hat@xmath85 for the adiabatic evolution , we emphasize that the additional advantage of saqc is the possibility of choosing an initial guess . in the next section we present some results obtained based on one of the simple nonlinear function @xmath84 and discuss the performance of both caqc and saqc for random 3-sat instances .",
    "in order to provide a proof of concept for saqc and to test the potential usefulness of both random and educated guesses in adiabatic evolution , we performed a numerical study on hard - to - satisfy 6- and 7-variable instances of the 3-sat problem and compared our results with the caqc approach .",

    "more precisely , to exhaustively study the impact of different initial guesses with respect to unique solutions in the behavior of saqc , we considered all 64 possible initial hamiltonians @xmath16 ( using eq .",

    "we wish to answer the question : what is the the impact of the initial guess in the spectral properties of the time - dependent hamiltonian ? to answer this , we explored the space of initial guesses in an exhaustive manner for the case of 6-variable and 7-variable sat instances .",

    "[ eq : runtime ] , i.e ,    @xmath159    where we have used the triangle and schwartz inequality and also the fact that @xmath160 , with @xmath102 close to 4.26 in this particular study .",
    "we can see that in the worst case scenario , @xmath153 scales linearly with the number of variables @xmath43 , and linearly with the intensity of the magnetic field , @xmath153 = @xmath161 .",
    "a similar analysis gives also that @xmath162 = @xmath161 , and therefore , we showed that for saqc , not surprisingly , the algorithmic complexity also relies on the scaling of @xmath20 .",
    "an interesting observation arise by analyzing the linear scaling of @xmath146 with @xmath81 and using the numerical results for the dependence of the typical minimum gap values as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "there seem to be at least two distinguishable regimes for the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath81 for both caqc and saqc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : median - flips - energies ] ) .",
    "for relatively small values of @xmath163 $ ] , @xmath20 scales approximately linearly with @xmath81 and therefore @xmath164 . since the running time",
    "is given by eq .",

    "however , for large values of @xmath81 , in the stationary regime where @xmath20 is almost constant , increasing field intensity through @xmath81 would make both algorithms less efficient as running time @xmath152 would increase roughly linearly with @xmath81 .",
    "both caqc and saqc would benefit from an increase in the transverse field for small values of @xmath81 , but notice that @xmath20 values for saqc are more sensitive to @xmath81 , and soon become better on average than those for caqc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : median - flips - energies ] ) . according to the previous discussion about running time as a function of @xmath81",
    ", it would be ideal to choose @xmath81 near the end of the linear regime ; in our calculations , @xmath81 somewhere in the interval ( 1,2 ) .",
    "further studies concerning the optimum value of @xmath81 as a function of the number of binary variables are needed , but we chose @xmath166 for our analysis on the performance in saqc and caqc described in the following section .",
    "the data sorted with respect to bfs and ucs shows an increase of the minimum gap , @xmath20 , as the hamming distance from the initial guess to the solution decreases ; the trend for uc is less apparent ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : median - flips - energies ] ) . computing the number of ucs produced by a given initial guess can be done in polynomial time on a classical computer .",
    "unfortunately there is no way to determine _ a priori _ how many bit flips the guess is from the solution , as that requires knowledge of the solution itself .",
    "additionally , fig .",
    "[ fig : probability - plots](a ) shows that the saqc implementation , using @xmath15 as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : hamilt_perturbation ] , does not necessarily favor states with low values of uc , but rather gives a homogenously distributed success probability between 25 - 45% , for @xmath167 .",
    "this is in accordance to the observation that solving 3-sat hard instances is not necessarily guided by minimizing the number of ucs @xcite . given the above scenario , we analyzed the likelihood of better performance by choosing initial guesses at random .    in the following discussion , we use the term _ significantly better _ initial guess to mean an initial condition that leads a saqc algorithm to be at least twice as fast as caqc , i.e. running times for caqc , @xmath168 , and saqc , @xmath169 , are such that @xmath170 or , equivalently , @xmath171 , assuming @xmath172 .",
    "for @xmath167 , choosing an initial state at random yields a probability greater than @xmath173 of having @xmath174 ( squares ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probability - plots](b ) .",
    "moreover , the probability of _ significantly better _ performance , i.e. @xmath175 is @xmath176 ( triangles ) . with the intention of predicting the performance of the saqc protocol in the limit of large @xmath51 , the third curve ( circles )",
    "was produced using the following rationale : for usa instances , the number of bit configurations with a given value of @xmath177 follows a binomial distribution @xmath178 . in the limit of large @xmath51 ,",
    "the likelihood of choosing a state in the central region of the binomial distribution is the highest .",
    "this observation led us to concentrate on the performance of the most populated instance subsets , those that correspond to bf @xmath179 for 7 variables . here",
    ", the probability of significantly better performance is close to @xmath180 .",
    "finally , we propose an algorithm based on saqc .",
    "an initial guess is chosen either at random or by applying expert - domain knowledge and then encoded into the initial ground state of @xmath16 ( eq .  [ h - initial ] ) . an adiabatic passage based on saqc",
    "is then performed either in serial or in parallel , depending on the availability of quantum hardware resources ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sombrero - aqc - algorithm ] . ) . as an example of the potential usefulness of our algorithm , recall from fig .",
    "[ fig : probability - plots ] that the probability of _ significantly better _ performance using saqc is @xmath181 for @xmath167 .",
    "one way to employ the probabilities we obtained from our numerical simulations in a more concrete scenario is : suppose one is assigned the task of using an adiabatic quantum computer and assume one uses eq .",
    "[ eq : runtime ] or any of the more stringent conditions for adiabaticity @xcite to estimate for how long one may need to run an algorithm under the caqc paradigm . moreover , suppose that this estimated running time required to remain in the ground state with a high success probability is @xmath182 2 days . using the numerical results presented in this paper , one can opt for performing the same task using saqc as follows : suppose we have absolutely no information about the problem as it was in the case of this numerical study with random 3-sat usa instances . instead of running the caqc algorithm for 2 days ,",
    "pick a guess state at random from all the possible assignments and then use it as initial state for saqc and run the algorithm with @xmath183 1 day . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : probability - plots ] , the probability of having picked a state whose performance is as good as caqc is 39% , for @xmath184 .",
    "if after measurement at the end of the first day the result is not a solution , we still can pick another state at random and let it run for one more day . by now",
    "the probability of having picked a state with the same performance as the caqc in the two trials equals 63% .",
    "note that in this simple probability calculations we are not taking into account the fact that even in the case where the state selected for the first run was not one of the ideal ones ( states corresponding to the 39 % of guesses for the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : probability - plots ] ) , we still have a very good chance that the non - ideal state still delivers a right answer after the first measurement .",
    "this probabability will depend of course on how close is the chosen state from the set of ideal ones .",
    "consequently , the execution of two saqc algorithms in serial would take at most as much time as the execution of only one caqc algorithm . by allowing us to choose two guesses to run in the same time as one case in caqc , the probability of choosing a significantly better initial guess in these two saqc executions increases from 39% to 63% .",
    "furthermore , even when no significantly better initial guess is chosen and the process is not guaranteed to be fully adiabatic , there is still some probability that we measure the correct solution at the end of both executions .",
    "in summary , we propose an algorithmic strategy which incorporates heuristics in adiabatic quantum computation . in particular , we study one of the most basic heuristic strategies consisting of initializing the computation with a desired initial state chosen by physical intuition , an educated guess , classical preprocessing of the problem , and/or by randomly choosing one of the possible assignments .",
    "this method allows to bridge powerful classical techniques such as heuristic optimization routines and/or mean - field calculations to obtain approximated solutions of the problem and use them as initial guess states for saqc .",
    "the strategy presented allows for a parallel and/or a concatenated scheme . the parallel setup might be helpful if several adiabatic quantum platforms are available in which several guesses can be run simultaneously , one guess to run in each one of the adiabatic processing units",
    "the idea of the concatenated scheme is to restart a failed adiabatic evolution with the measured excited state . assuming a near - adiabatic trajectory , the measured excited state can be taken as a refined guess from which the quantum evolution is restarted .",
    "notice this is not possible in the conventional approach which would restart the evolution from the full superposition , attributing equal probability to all the states , therefore  erasing \" the information gained in the previous near - adiabatic evolution .",
    "neither of the two features proposed above are possible in any of the different adiabatic quantum computation proposals to date .",
    "in addition , all the modifications proposed related to different adiabatic paths , auxiliary perturbations @xcite can also be explored in the context of saqc , which is also suitable to study quantum problems @xcite .",
    "the numerical study performed in this paper is a proof - of - principle to explore the importance and consequences of starting the adiabatic evolution with a guess state and to illustrate that incorporating this kind of heuristics in aqc is possible and might be advantageous .",
    "our numerical simulations show that starting the adiabatic evolution with a guess state which has a zero - overlap with the solution , @xmath185 , is not a big concern . on the contrary ,",
    "even when there is no hope to make an educated guess and selection of the initial state at random is the only available alternative , we obtain that approximately 40% of states might allow running the quantum algorithm at least twice as fast when compared to caqc .",
    "this possibility of running the algorithm for shorter times but with several trials brings also additional advantages of getting the right answer in any intermediate measure .",
    "moreover , these shorter runs would be less affected by decoherence effects .    even though the procedure used for the performance comparison , caqc _ vs. _",
    "saqc , is  reasonable \" since it is based on the widely - used minimum gap criteria and its connection with the algorithm run - time ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : runtime ] ) , we are aware of the limitations of this analysis  @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that the present numerical results are only encouraging indicators that heuristics in aqc might be a valuable algorithmic strategy for aqc , given the strong dependence of the value of the minimum gap as a function of the initial guess chosen .",
    "it is not our purpose to claim superiority of saqc but to introduce the approach and the motivation behind it . for a more rigorous comparison of both schemes , caqc and saqc , we suggest numerical experiments which are not meant to be exhaustive but preferably involving larger size instances , and to explore different problems other than random 3-sat .",
    "for example , we are interested in performing these studies for relevant instances of our recently developed aqc proposal for protein folding @xcite and for adiabatic preparation of molecular ground states @xcite where we expect the mean - field ( hartree - fock ) solution to be a better guess than a full superposition . numerical propagation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , instead of inspection of the minimum gap after the hamiltonian diagonalization , for these cases will provide a realistic simulation of the quantum computation .",
    "open questions to be explored further is the connections between saqc , quantum phase transitions @xcite , entanglement @xcite and the effect of local minima @xcite .",
    "the performance of the adiabatic algorithm in the limit of large @xmath51 is still an open question @xcite which needs to be explored in the context of saqc .",
    "it is not obvious that the same observations and conclusions / observations mentioned above for caqc will hold for saqc as well . for example , we think that saqc might be a strategy to avoid the local minima traps described in ref .  @xcite . from the study of the spectral properties of the random 3-sat instances studied",
    ", we found that some initial states have a considerably larger gap and while others show a considerably smaller gap when compared with caqc . since the initial state in caqc is a full superposition of all the possible states or solutions , including the ones with a large gap and others with small gap , we conjecture here that having a full superposition will not necessarily be the best choice , given that the presence of the states with small gaps could slow down the quantum evolution .",
    "an analysis beyond the gap criteria would be needed to test this conjecture .",
    "solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the entire evolution is the most straightforward , yet numerically - challenging approach . in saqc ,",
    "the probability of obtaining these trap states can be avoided and even in the case of a failed evolution , the concatenated scheme may help to restart using a better guess .",
    "in contrast , in caqc , the full superposition including states with considerably small gap might result in a bottleneck for the dynamics towards a successful computation .",
