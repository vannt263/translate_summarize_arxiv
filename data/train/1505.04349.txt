    "bulk fluctuations of conserved charges are believed to be useful observables for the study of thermal property of the primordial medium created in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "active experimental analyses of fluctuation observables have been performed in the beam - energy scan ( bes ) program @xcite at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite , as well as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "these experiments have been observed not only the second order but also higher order cumulants characterizing non - gaussianity of the fluctuations by the event - by - event analysis .",
    "various theoretical suggestions have been made to utilize fluctuation observables as signals of the deconfinement transition and the qcd critical point @xcite .",
    "the cumulants of conserved charges in the equilibrated medium are also observable in lattice qcd monte carlo simulations , and the numerical study of various cumulants have been carried out actively @xcite .",
    "one of the most notable features of the measurement of fluctuations in heavy ion collisions is that higher order cumulants of particle numbers in a rapidity window have been observed with moderate statistics up to fourth order .",
    "such measurements are possible because the systems observed in these experiments are not large ; the particle number measured in one event is at most of order @xmath0 @xcite , although the local equilibration is expected to realize for some period in the time evolution .",
    "experimental detectors are designed to observe and identify almost all charged particles entering the detector .",
    "they thus can provide _ full counting statistics _ @xcite of the event - by - event distribution of the particle numbers up to the error arising from the acceptance , efficiency and particle miss identifications @xcite of the detectors .    because the experimental detectors in heavy ion collisions count particle numbers which arrive at the detectors , the event - by - event analysis can observe fluctuations in the final state of the collision events .",
    "if the fluctuations are fully equilibrated in the final state , they can only tell us information on the thermodynamics at this time , which is in the hadronic medium and well described by the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model @xcite .",
    "the experimental results , however , suggest that the observed fluctuations are not the one of the equilibrated hadronic medium .",
    "first , the experimental results on the cumulants and their ratios have statistically - significant deviation from the values in the hrg model @xcite . in the hrg model , the fluctuations of net particle numbers , including net - baryon and net - electric charge which are conserved charges , are given by the skellam distribution to a good approximation @xcite .",
    "the cumulants observed at rhic and lhc show deviations from these skellam values .",
    "the second observation is concerned with the rapidity window dependences of the cumulants . in a thermal medium in grand canonical ensemble , cumulants of conserved charges",
    "are extensive variables and proportional to volume . in heavy ion collisions , fluctuations of particle number in a given pseudo - rapidity window , @xmath1 ,",
    "are observed . assuming the bjorken expansion and that the pseudo - rapidity window can be used as a proxy of the one of the coordinate - space rapidity , @xmath2 @xcite , the spatial volume to count the particle number is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the cumulants , therefore , should be proportional to @xmath1 if the fluctuations are fully equilibrated .",
    "the net - electric charge fluctuation @xmath3 observed by alice collaboration @xcite , however , clearly shows that this proportionality is violated . a similar violation is also indicated in the higher order cumulants of net - proton number observed by star collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is this non - equilibrium nature of fluctuations which enables us to explore the primordial thermodynamics using fluctuation observables @xcite .    for conserved charges ,",
    "the off - equilibrium property of fluctuations in the final state is not surprising , because the modification of local density of a conserved charge is proceeded only by the diffusive processes , which is typically slow ; because of the conservation law , the time scale of the diffusive process can become arbitrary slow as the spatial scale becomes larger .",
    "in fact , earlier studies suggested that the time scale of the diffusive process for conserved charges is so slow that the thermal fluctuations generated in the deconfined medium survive until the final state when @xmath1 is taken sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "because the effect of the diffusion with a fixed @xmath1 is determined by the transport of the charges , the conservation law also suggests that one can investigate the transport property of the hot medium , such as the magnitude of the diffusion constant , experimentally using the @xmath1 dependence of conserved - charge fluctuations @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the time evolution of fluctuations are considered only for gaussian fluctuations . because the heavy ion collisions can measure the higher order cumulants , the @xmath1 dependences of not only gaussian but also non - gaussian fluctuations should encode more information on the thermal and transport properties of the medium @xcite . to extract such information ,",
    "however , an appropriate description of the non - equilibrium time evolution of the non - gaussian fluctuations is required .    when one investigates the diffusive process of non - gaussian fluctuations in heavy ion collisions , it is important to keep in mind that the cumulants observed so far are not far from the ones of the skellam distribution @xcite , which are the equilibrated values in the hrg model .",
    "a possible interpretation of these results is that the signals in cumulants are developed in the primordial stage , but they are blurred by the diffusive process in the hadronic stage .",
    "in fact , the experimental result in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the fluctuations _ increase _ toward the equilibrated value in the hadronic medium due to the diffusion @xcite . if this is the case , it is important to describe the approach of the cumulants toward the hadronic value in the analysis of the diffusive process in the hadronic medium . for this purpose , the model for the diffusive process should have nonzero higher order cumulants in equilibrium which are consistent with those in the hadronic medium .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , to describe the time evolution of non - gaussian fluctuations the diffusion master equation ( dme ) is employed . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in this model the fluctuations in equilibrium are given by the poisson or skellam distribution as a consequence of the discrete nature of the particle number .",
    "the time evolutions of the second and fourth order cumulants of net particle numbers are studied in this model .",
    "it is found that the fourth - order cumulant can show characteristic behaviors as a function of @xmath4 and tends to be suppressed compared with the second order one , if the thermal fluctuations in the primordial medium are suppressed .",
    "these results can be confirmed experimentally with the present detectors .",
    "the analysis is later extended to finite volume systems @xcite to investigate the effect of the global charge conservation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to elaborate on detailed discussions skipped in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present study",
    ", we show the analytic procedure for obtaining the time evolution of cumulants in the dme with arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "we also extend the discussion on the @xmath4 dependence of cumulants in ref .",

    "the @xmath4 dependence of the third order cumulant is considered in addition to second and fourth order ones discussed in ref .",
    "the initial condition is also extended to more general cases . using these results",

    "as we will see later , after taking the continuum limit the time evolution of the average particle number density @xmath15 ( the exact definition will be given in sec .  [ sec : continuum ] ) in the dme obeys the standard diffusion equation @xmath16 with the diffusion constant @xmath17 .",

    "such a case would be realized when the medium near the critical point is formed in the time evolution of the hot medium and the critical enhancement of fluctuations are well developed @xcite . in fig .",

    "in the previous section we have discussed the rapidity window @xmath4 dependence of the cumulants .",

    "@xmath200 , @xmath214 and @xmath216 , parameters in the model and underlying physics on the thermal and transport properties of the hot medium can be constrained experimentally .",
    "the discussion in the previous section also tells us the importance of the total understanding of the @xmath4 dependences of the experimental results . because the value of the cumulants with a fixed @xmath4 can deviate significantly from the initial and final values ,",
    "they should not be directly compared with theoretical studies which are obtained in statistical mechanics assuming equilibration , such as lattice simulations .",
    "the quantities which should be compared with the cumulants in statistical mechanics are @xmath184 , @xmath215 and @xmath212 , which can be deduced by the analysis of the @xmath4 dependence .",
    "we note that the @xmath4 dependence of the gaussian fluctuation encodes the same physical information as those accessible with the balance function @xcite of the corresponding particle species , because the former is obtained by the integral of the latter , and vice versa @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4 dependences of non - gaussian cumulants are related to multi - particle correlation functions , and provide us with a novel information on the diffusive process of conserved charges .",
    "all the results in this study is obtained using the dme . in this model",
    "it is assumed that the brownian particles in the model do not interact with each other .",
    "this assumption would be qualitatively justified when @xmath128 is identified to be the net - baryon number because of the following two reasons .",
    "first , baryons in the hadronic medium mainly interact with pions , and the baryon - baryon interactions scarcely take place @xcite .",
    "second , the success of the thermal model for the particle abundances indicates that the pair annihilation of baryons is well suppressed after chemical freezeout @xcite .",
    "the baryons thus can be regarded as the brownian particles floating in the pionic medium without interacting with one another , and the correlation between two baryons in the hadronic medium will be well suppressed . for net - electric charges , on the other hand , the interactions , especially the pair - annihilation , occur frequently between hadrons having electric charge , especially pions .",
    "the present model thus would not be suitable for the quantitative description of the diffusive process of the net - electric charge fluctuations .",
    "it is desirable to extend the model to incorporate the interaction between particles for more quantitative description of the net - electric charge fluctuations . in the present study",
    "it is also assumed that the fluctuations satisfy the locality condition at chemical freezeout time , which , however , might be violated in realistic collision events .",
    "to incorporate such effects one has to modify the initial condition .",
    "we left these extensions to future study and do not address further in this study .    in this paper , we considered the time evolution and rapidity window , @xmath4 , dependences of the cumulants of conserved charges observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions . in order to describe the non - equilibrium time evolution of non - gaussian cumulants we employed the diffusion master equation eq .",
