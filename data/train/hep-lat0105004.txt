    "understanding the mechanisms of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd has been a major goal of non - perturbative field theory for many years . a good candidate for the source of chiral symmetry",
    "breaking are topological fluctuations of the gauge fields associated with instantons and anti - instantons . through mixing ,",
    "the `` would be zero modes '' from the instantons and anti - instantons become the small modes that lead , when present with a finite density , to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "many of the low energy properties of qcd can be explained phenomenologically by the interactions of the fermions with instantons and anti - instantons @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "confinement , though , is not one of those properties .",
    "however , as pointed out by witten  @xcite , there is an inconsistency between instanton based phenomenology and large-@xmath0 qcd .",
    "instantons would produce an @xmath1 mass that vanishes exponentially for large @xmath0 , while considerations based on large-@xmath0 chiral dynamics suggest that the @xmath1 mass should be of order @xmath2 .",
    "the topological charge fluctuations then should be associated not to instantons but rather some other , confinement - related vacuum fluctuations . and",
    "the strong attraction produced by these confinement - related fluctuations would also induce the breaking of chiral symmetry .    in an attempt to settle the issue , whether topological charge fluctuations are instanton dominated or not , horvth , isgur , mccune and thacker  @xcite investigated the response of fermions by considering low lying eigenmodes of a lattice discretized dirac operator and quantifying the extend to which , in the peak regions of these eigenmodes they are chiral , as would be expected if the almost zero modes around instantons dominate these low lying eigenmodes .",
    "they introduced a local `` chiral orientation '' parameter , or `` chirality '' parameter , @xmath3 , via the definition @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the left- and right - handed components of the eigenmode .",
    "chirality near @xmath7 would be obtained from almost zero modes due to instantons and anti - instantons , lifted from being exact zero modes by their mixing .",
    "horvth _ et al . _",
    "@xcite chose the wilson discretization for their lattice dirac operator and claim to have found evidence against instanton dominance of topological charge fluctuations from the behavior of the chirality parameter .",
    "however , the wilson - dirac operator explicitly breaks chiral symmetry at any finite lattice spacing @xmath8 . as a consequence",
    ", the wilson - dirac operator does not have exact ( chiral ) zero modes in gauge fields with a non - trivial topological charge . and",
    "the discretization effects responsible might well also strongly affect the chirality parameter .",
    "to our knowledge , the magnitude of such distortion effects at the presently accessible lattice spacings are not known . however , the scaling violations for hadron masses due to the @xmath9 lattice artifacts at the lattice spacing used by horvth _ et al .  _",
    "( @xmath10 fm at @xmath11 ) are known to be as large as 3040%  @xcite .    in a response to @xcite degrand and hasenfratz presented evidence that is suggestive of instanton dominance of topological charge fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "they used a variant of the overlap - dirac operator , proposed and investigated in  @xcite , for the lattice dirac operator .",
    "the overlap - dirac operator  @xcite , and any variant that substitutes the wilson - dirac operator used in its construction by another suitable wilson - like discretization of the dirac operator , has the chiral and topological properties of the continuum dirac operator even at finite lattice spacing , _",
    "e.g. _ exact chiral zero modes in gauge fields with a non - trivial topological charge",
    ". however , degrand and hasenfratz coupled their overlap fermions not directly to the `` rough '' lattice gauge fields , but rather to `` ape smeared '' gauge fields , essentially gaussian smeared fields with fixed width in lattice units .",
    "while such a fermion action is local and therefore does not change universality class , the distortions the smearing procedure might induce at finite lattice spacings are not known .",
    "indeed , the level of smearing used by degrand and hasenfratz removes ultraviolet fluctuations in the gauge field to an extent where pure gauge observables start to `` feel '' and be able to identify instanton - like topological excitations that on the `` rough '' lattice gauge fields are completely obscured by the dominant ultraviolet fluctuations",
    ". for example , the naive topological charge measurements gives results that are clearly peaked around integer values .",
    "the smearing used distorts the short distance part of the heavy quark potential , to a distance of about 3 lattice spacings , and lowers the value obtained for @xmath12 when the fat links are used in the clover dirac operator  @xcite . whether the smearing affects properties of light fermions has , to our knowledge ,",
    "not been investigated thoroughly .    in an earlier paper , using the same variant of the overlap - dirac operator , degrand and hasenfratz produced evidence that the chiral density @xmath13 comes in lumps on the lattice @xcite , and furthermore that the correlation function of the chiral density with itself is similar in shape to the correlation function of the chiral density @xmath14 with the topological charge density @xmath15 obtained from an ape - smeared operator .",
    "but , since ape - smearing is involved , these results are not beyond doubt . indeed , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that the `` lumpiness '' observed in the correlation function of the chiral density @xmath14 could occur without these lumps being _",
    "purely _ right - handed or left - handed .    here",
    "we address these questions using the standard overlap - dirac operator  @xcite with the fermions coupled to the original lattice gauge fields .",
    "we thereby avoid potential distortions due to smearing while we retain all chiral properties including existence of exact zero modes and thus avoid the lattice artifacts , unknown in magnitude and significance , of wilson fermions .",

    "then , @xmath19 commutes with @xmath20 and can be simultaneously diagonalized  @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 can have zero eigenvalues with chiral eigenmodes , which are also eigenmodes of @xmath22 , due to global topology .",
    "the non - zero eigenmodes of @xmath21 are doubly degenerate and have opposite chirality , @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the non - zero ( right ) eigenmodes of @xmath22 are then easily obtained as @xmath25 with eigenvalues @xmath26 the `` chirality '' parameter of eq .",

    "they will be therefore counted as one mode .",

    "we computed low - lying eigenmodes @xmath30 of @xmath21 with the ritz functional algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the sign function @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dov ] ) we used the optimal rational approximation of @xcite with `` projection of low - lying eigenvectors of @xmath32 '' to ensure sufficient accuracy .",
    "we computed the 20 eigenmodes @xmath30 of @xmath21 with smallest @xmath33 on ensembles of @xmath34 pure gauge wilson action configurations with @xmath11 and 5.85 , and wilson - dirac mass of @xmath35 .",
    "the gauge configurations have lattice spacing of about 0.17 and 0.125 fm , respectively , and hence volumes of about 7 and 2 @xmath36 .",
    "we also computed the 20 lowest eigenmodes on an ensemble of @xmath37 lattices with @xmath11 , with a volume of about 2.2 @xmath36 , fairly close to the volume of the @xmath38 ensemble .    in fig .",

    "the number of instantons and anti - instantons , and hence the number of almost zero modes grows linearly with the volume .",
    "then it is not surprising that the lowest modes become increasingly chiral in their peaks with increasing volume . comparing the two ensembles with almost equal volume in physical units , we notice a tendency of the peaks to become more chiral as the lattice spacing",
    "is decreased .    comparing with fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite we see that in their peaks the lowest two non - zero eigenmodes of the overlap - dirac operator appear to be more chiral than the real modes of the wilson - dirac operator . considering that ref .",
    "@xcite used a lattice with larger volume of about 35 @xmath36 and the dramatic volume dependence of the chirality histogram observed here leads one to suspect that the chiral symmetry breaking lattice artifacts of the wilson - dirac operator are truly significant at the lattice spacing used .    comparing with fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite , on the other hand , where a physical volume of about 3.5 @xmath36 was used , indicates that the ape smeared fields used by degrand and hasenfratz enhance the chirality in the peaks of the lowest - lying non - zero modes somewhat .",
    "degrand and hasenfratz already noted a slight dependence on the smearing of gauge fields ( see fig .  4 of  @xcite ) , though the effect appears much smaller than the effects of the lattice artifacts from using wilson fermions .",
    "considering also the next two higher modes while further restricting the peak region gives the chirality histograms for the two smaller lattices shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_w_4l_0p5pc ] .",

    ", we would like to consider a still larger volume , as well as a lattice at smaller lattice spacing .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical implementation of overlap fermions becomes increasingly difficult and costly , due to the finite density of modes with almost zero eigenvalues of the underlying wilson - dirac operator  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that these modes are caused by lattice artifact dislocations in the gauge fields generated with wilson like gauge actions .",
    "it is known  @xcite that these same small modes are responsible for the residual chiral symmetry breaking observed for domain wall fermions with finite 5-th dimension @xmath40 .",
    "it was found that improving the gauge action via the symanzik improved action suppresses the dislocations and decreases the density of small modes  @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the residual chiral symmetry breaking for domain wall fermions on gauge fields generated with an improved gauge action is much reduced  @xcite . and in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that the cost of implementing the overlap - dirac operator on gauge fields with a tree - level symanzik improved gauge action is lowered .",
    "we made a study of various gauge actions to find which one lowered the density of small modes and would consequently lower the cost of implementing the overlap - dirac operator .",
    "the density of zero eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath41 at the mass @xmath35 was determined for quenched backgrounds from the iwasaki  @xcite , tree - level tadpole - improved and 1-loop tadpole - improved lscher - weisz gauge action  @xcite .",
    "this was done by computing the low lying eigenvalues of @xmath42 using the ritz functional  @xcite .",
    "the low lying eigenvalues over the whole ensemble are then used to obtain the integral of the spectral density function , @xmath43 . a linear fit in @xmath33",
    "is made , and @xmath41 is obtained as the coefficient of the linear term .",
    "comparisons were made with the wilson gauge action at two scales determined by the string tension .",
    "the results shown in table  [ tab : rho0 ] show the quenched iwasaki gauge action to have the lowest @xmath41 .",
    "for example , at the lattice spacing equivalent to wilson gauge action @xmath11 the @xmath41 is reduced by a factor of about 5 .",
    "we therefore generated gauge field ensembles with iwasaki s action with @xmath44 and 2.45 , chosen to give the same lattice spacing , in units of the string tension , as the ensembles already considered with wilson action at @xmath11 and 5.85 . as expected , since the density of small modes of the wilson - dirac operator used in the overlap fermion construction were considerably reduced , the overlap fermion computation became much faster .",
    "for example , at the lattice spacing equivalent to wilson @xmath11 and lattice size @xmath45 the cost of the inner conjugate - gradient step in applying the overlap - dirac operator was reduced from between 200 to 400 iterations to between 120 to 170 iterations .",
    "the average time per configuration to compute the 20 lowest eigenvectors was reduced by roughly a factor of 3 .",
    "this made it feasible to consider lattices of size @xmath46 , giving a volume of about 23.6 @xmath36 at @xmath47 and 6.7 @xmath36 at @xmath48 , _",
