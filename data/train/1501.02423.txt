    "the primary goal of heavy - ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies is to explore the signatures of the de - confined state of mater , the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "dedicated experiments at the rhic at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and the lhc at cern have been setup for studying the qgp matter at the high temperatures ( @xmath2 ) and low baryon chemical potentials ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "several signatures for studying the phase transition from hadronic matter to qgp have been proposed and as well as studied in dedicated experiments at bnl and cern for the last few decades .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of conserved charges in limited phase space have been widely accepted as one of the most tantalizing signals of the qgp formation and also for the search of the qcd critical point  @xcite . with their large coverage ,",
    "the star experiment at rhic  @xcite and the alice at lhc  @xcite are ideally suited for the detailed study of the qgp matter on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the dynamical charge fluctuations have been reported by these experiments  @xcite .",
    "recent results from alice have shown significant reduction in the ratio of charge fluctuations per entropy at the lhc energy  @xcite , confirming to the qgp formation in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of conserved quantities such as net electric charge and net baryon number act as distinct signals for the transition from hadronic ( confined ) phase to qgp ( de - confined ) phase .",
    "the amount of charge fluctuations is proportional to the squares of the charges present in the system , which depend on the state from which the charges originate .",
    "the system passing through a qgp phase has quarks as the charge carriers whereas for a hadron gas ( hg ) the charge carriers are the charged hadrons .",
    "thus the charge fluctuations in case of qgp with fractional charges should be significantly lower than the hg where the charges are integral . due to the differences in degrees of freedom of the two phases , qgp and hg ,",
    "the magnitude of the charge fluctuations are very different .",
    "it is estimated that for the qgp , charge fluctuations are much smaller than the hg  @xcite . here",
    "the question aries whether these primordial fluctuations , either from a qgp or from a hg survive during the course of the evolution of the system  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations observed at the freeze - out depend crucially on the equation of state of the system and final state effects .",
    "non - equilibrium studies at the early partonic stage show that large charge fluctuations survive if it is accompanied by a large temperature fluctuations at freeze - out  @xcite . in reality",
    ", the measurement of charge fluctuations depends on the observation window , which is to be properly chosen so that majority of the fluctuations are captured without being affected by the conservation limits  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the event - by - event dynamical net - charge fluctuations originating from the purely hadronic state using urqmd  @xcite and hijing  @xcite event generators at different times during the evolution of hadronic interaction .",
    "the dynamical charge fluctuations have been estimated at different time steps , and by varying the pseudo - rapidity window ( @xmath0 ) of the measurement .",
    "the main focus is to understand the effect of final state effects which diffuse the charge fluctuations at different time and @xmath0   window .",
    "assuming hadronization and freeze - out occur roughly at 5  fm/@xmath4 and 30  fm/@xmath4 , respectively , we have calculated the fluctuations of the system at 5  fm/@xmath4 , 30  fm/@xmath4 , and at a much latter time of 100  fm/@xmath4 , where all possible interactions must seize .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the measure of dynamical charge fluctuations in heavy - ion - collisions are discussed in section - ii . in section - iii , we present particle multiplicity distributions at @xmath0  =  1 , for different time steps for central au+au collisions at @xmath1  =  200  gev , using urqmd .",
    "the measure of dynamical charge fluctuations at different time steps and @xmath0  window are discussed in section - iv .",
    "the results of the calculations from hadronic models are presented in section - v , along with the experimental data from star and alice .",
    "the paper is summarized in section - vi .",
    "the net - charge and the total charge of a system are denoted in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the multiplicities of positive and negative charged particles , respectively .",
    "the net - charge fluctuations can be expressed in terms of its ratio to entropy in order to take the volume term into account .",
    "thus , one of the observables for net - charge fluctuations is  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the variance of the net - charge .",
    "the value of @xmath11 has been estimated by theoretical models for a qgp and a hg by taking various final state effects into account  @xcite .",
    "early estimations had put the value of @xmath11 to be approximately 4 times smaller for a qgp compared to a hg . for a hg",
    ", resonance decays including those of neutral particles introduce additional correlation between charged particles , which reduces the value of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "present understandings put the value of @xmath11 to be @xmath12 for a qgp and 2.8 for a hg . in all cases ,",
    "the signal gets diffused from hadronization time to freeze - out because of the final state interactions which need to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "net - charge fluctuations , measured in terms of @xmath11 , have contributions from statistical as well as dynamical origin .",
    "it is a rather difficult task to estimate the dynamical component from the total fluctuations .",
    "a novel method of estimation of the dynamical fluctuations has been proposed , which takes into account the correlation strengths between @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 charged particle pairs  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the relative number of positive ( @xmath16 ) and negative ( @xmath17 ) charged particles can be expressed in terms of its second moment as , @xmath18 here , the notation @xmath19 @xmath20denotes average over the ensemble of events .",
    "assuming independent particle production mechanism , the value of @xmath21 in the poisson limit can be expressed as , @xmath22 the dynamical component is then evaluated as a difference between the two measured fluctuations , expressed as , @xmath23 this can be expanded as , @xmath24 a stronger correlation between @xmath15 pairs compared to @xmath13 and @xmath14 pairs yields a negative value of @xmath25 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath25 is related to the net - charge fluctuations , @xmath11 by , @xmath26 by determining @xmath25 in the experiments , one can have access to net - charge fluctuations .",
    "the magnitude of net charge fluctuations is limited by global conservation of charged particles  @xcite .",
    "considering the effect of global charge conservation , the dynamical fluctuations need to be corrected by a factor of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the average of total number of charged particles produced over full phase space .",
    "the corrected value of @xmath25 after considering the global charge conservation and finite acceptance is @xmath29 the modified value of the net - charge fluctuations turns out to be : @xmath30 in the rest of the article we will evaluate @xmath31  and @xmath11 for different center - of - mass energies .",
    "in order to understand the evolution of multiplicity distributions of different particle species at different time steps , we have used urqmd model simulations for au+au collisions corresponding to rhic energies .",
    "the urqmd model simulates the microscopic transport of covariant propagation of quarks and di - quarks with hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the formation of hadrons is introduced by the color string fragmentation .",
    "various resonances and their decay along with re - scattering among hadrons have been incorporated during the evolution  @xcite .",
    "this model helps to explore the evolution of conserved charge fluctuations and their distribution at different time steps in the hadronic medium .",

    "the multiplicity distributions of pions and kaons mainly contribute the change in total positive and negative charged multiplicity distribution .",
