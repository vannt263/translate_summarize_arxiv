    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are known to be huge molecular gas reservoirs [ @xmath6 ] .",
    "the results of @xmath0co(10 ) and ( 21 ) observations reveal that this molecular gas is usually concentrated at the center of the galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , and in general it forms a compact ( radius @xmath7 kpc ) rotating disk or ring ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular gas within the disk or ring often shows large turbulent motions , and the molecular line profiles exhibit large velocity widths of up to 1000 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the physical properties , namely the density and the temperature , of the molecular gas in lirgs / ulirgs are still being studied .",
    "single - dish hcn(10 ) observations ( @xcite ; @xcite , ) revealed that most of their molecular gas is supposed to be dense [ @xmath9 cm @xmath10 .",
    "single - dish observations of higher excitation @xmath0co and @xmath2co emissions suggest there is large amount of warm molecular gas ( @xcite ) . for the denser and warmer molecular gas tracers ( e.g. hcn , @xmath2co ) ,",
    "however , the spatial distributions in lirgs / ulirgs are still unknown , although the physical properties of gas are keys to understand the activity of lirgs / ulirgs ( starburst in the nuclear region and/or agn ) . moreover , the spatial variations of the molecular gas density and the temperature in the circumnuclear regions of lirgs / ulirgs are still unclear . for such studies ,",
    "high angular resolution observations of molecular lines with radio interferometers are needed , but only a few observations have been performed so far ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 6240 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( b1950 ) ; @xmath13 mpc , if we adopt @xmath14 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ; = 475 pc ) is one of the most well - known nearby lirgs , with an infrared luminosity of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this galaxy is a merger , with clearly visible disturbed morphology and tidal tails in optical images .",
    "ngc 6240 also has double nuclei detected in a wide range of wavelengths from x - rays to radio ( @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent separation of the nuclei is ( 710 pc ) in the 15 ghz radio continuum map @xcite .",
    "each of the nuclei are accompanied by an intense massive star - forming region ( e.g. @xcite ) , and both of them also host an agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "interferometric @xmath0co(10 ) and ( 21 ) observations have been carried out by many groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations show that about half of the molecular gas is concentrated in a rotating thick disk - like structure ( @xmath16 pc diameter ) between the double nuclei , but the motion of the gas is highly disturbed and shows large velocity dispersions .",
    "the total mass of the molecular gas within a radius of @xmath17 pc is estimated to be 24@xmath18 , which constitutes about half of the dynamical mass @xcite .",
    "intense hcn(10 ) emission has been detected with the iram 30 m telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the obtained hcn/@xmath0co(10 ) intensity ratio is 0.15 , which is a typical value for starburst galaxies , and suggests the presence of large amounts of dense molecular gas .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of interferometric observations of molecular emission lines toward the central region of ngc 6240 .",
    "the main goal of this study is to reveal the location and distribution of dense gas and to constrain the physical properties of the molecular gas .",
    "we describe the observational parameters and data - reduction procedures in section 2 , and the observational results of the @xmath0co , hcn , hco@xmath1 , and @xmath2co emission lines and continuum emission in section 3 . in this section",
    ", we also refer to the observed molecular line intensity ratios and those characteristics . with these data ,",
    "the physical properties of the molecular gas are discussed in section 4 , and the evolutionary scenario of molecular gas and star formation according to the merging process is described in section 5 . finally , we summarize our study in section 6 .",
    "aperture synthesis observations toward ngc 6240 were carried out with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) and the rainbow interferometer at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) between 1995 november  1996 march , and 2000 january  2003 april .",
    "the nma consists of six 10 m - antennas equipped with cooled dsb sis receivers .",
    "the rainbow interferometer is a 7-element array combining the nma with the nro 45 m telescope , providing higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than those of the nma .",
    "we observed ngc 6240 in the following emission lines : @xmath0co(10 ) , hcn(10 ) , hco@xmath1(10 ) , and @xmath2co(10 ) .",
    "except for the @xmath0co observations , the backend we used was the ultra - wide - band correlator ( uwbc ; @xcite ) . for the @xmath0co observations ,",
    "the old - fx correlator was employed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the quasars b1548 + 015 , b1656 + 053 , and b1655 + 077 were used for phase and amplitude reference calibrations ; 3c 279 , 3c 345 , and 3c 454.3 were used for bandpass calibration .",
    "uranus , neptune , and mars were used as absolute flux - scale calibrations for the amplitude calibrator .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute flux scale were estimated to be @xmath19% for each observation .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath1 emissions were observed simultaneously within the same correlator passband .",
    "the uv - data were calibrated with the uvproc - ii software package developed at nro ( @xcite ) , and then imaged with natural uv weighting , and cleaned , with the nrao aips package .",
    "the detailed observational parameters are summarized in table [ obslog ] .",
    "in this section we describe the distributions and kinematical properties of the observed emission lines and calculate the intensity ratios .",
    "our hco@xmath1 and @xmath2co interferometric observations are the first ones on ngc 6240 .",
    "the observational results of continuum emission at 87 ghz and 108 ghz are also presented .",
    "table [ obsres ] summarizes the observational results .",
    "figure [ intmaps]a shows integrated intensity map of the @xmath0co(10 ) emission . (",
    "no primary beam correction has been applied to the maps presented in this paper . )",
    "the distribution of the @xmath0co emission is more extended than the size of the synthesized beam , suggesting that it is mildly resolved .",
    "the peak of the @xmath0co emission is located between the double nuclei defined by the 15 ghz continuum peaks @xcite , not on either of them .",
    "figure [ cochmap ] shows the @xmath0co velocity channel maps , and the @xmath0co position ",
    "velocity map sliced along the double nuclei ( the position angle is from north to east ) is presented in figure [ copvmap ] .",
    "the velocity profile of the @xmath0co line at the emission peak is presented in figure [ lineprofs ] , together with those of the hcn , hco@xmath1 , and @xmath2co emissions .",
    "these plots reveal that the velocity width of the @xmath0co line is extremely large .",
    "the full width at half maximum is 420 km s@xmath8 , and the full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) is @xmath20 600 km s@xmath8 [ the recent interferometric observations @xcite show that the fwzi of @xmath0co emission is about 900 km s@xmath8 ] .",
    "the observed total integrated intensity of @xmath0co is 168.3 jy km s@xmath8 , which is 71% of the single dish flux obtained by the iram 30 m telescope ( @xcite).co data . in order to obtain the continuum - free @xmath0co intensity",
    ", the continuum emission contribution is removed numerically .",
    "the way we employed is as follows . from the velocity integrated map within 767 km s@xmath8 ( figure [ intmaps]a )",
    ", we primarily obtained the total emission flux ( @xmath0co + continuum ) of 176.9 jy km s@xmath8 .",
    "a 112 ghz continuum flux of 11.2 mjy was estimated from the spectrum assuming a single power - law ( @xmath22 ) between cm - wave and mm - wave ( see also figure [ contsed ] ) . thus the total continuum emission contribution in figure [ intmaps]a is estimated to be 8.59 jy km s@xmath8 (= 11.2 mjy @xmath23 767 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "we then subtracted this from the primarily flux , and obtained the continuum - free and velocity- and spatially - integrated @xmath0co line flux of 168.3 jy km s@xmath8 . ] a slight velocity gradient along the double nuclei is seen in the position  velocity map ( see figure [ copvmap ] ) .",
    "the trend of the velocity gradient is the same as that in the @xmath0co(21 ) map by @xcite ; the redshifted velocity components are in the north - east , and the blueshifted velocity ones are in the south - west",
    ". these results are consistent with the recent @xmath0co(10 ) observations by bryant and scoville ( 1999 ) .",
    "figure [ intmaps]b shows the hcn(10 ) integrated intensity map .",
    "the continuum emission , which was detected by averaging line - free channels with an effective bandwidth of 376 mhz , was subtracted from the visibility data before creating the hcn synthesized image .",
    "since the hcn emission is unresolved with our @xmath24 beam , it must be more spatially compact than the @xmath0co distribution .",
    "the emission peak is located between the double nuclei , within of the peak position of the @xmath0co(10 ) emission .",
    "it should be noted that the hcn emission peak ( and also @xmath0co ) is not coincident with the current star - forming regions traced by near - infrared ( nir ) emission lines ; the star - forming regions are associated with both of the double nuclei ( e.g. @xcite ) . we will focus on this issue in section 5 .",
    "the detected total flux of hcn emission is 14.1 jy km s@xmath8 , or @xmath25% of single - dish flux obtained by solomon , downes , and radford ( 1992 ) .",
    "the observed flux also agrees very well with the interferometric data by @xcite .",
    "figure [ intmaps]c shows the integrated intensity map of hco@xmath1(10 ) emission .",
    "the procedure of continuum subtraction is the same as that of the hcn data , because both lines are observed simultaneously in the same passband .",
    "this is the first detection of the hco@xmath1 line from ngc 6240 . like the @xmath0co and hcn emissions",
    ", the hco@xmath1 emission is peaked between the double nuclei .",
    "the spatial distribution of the hco@xmath1 emission is also compact and resembles that of the hcn emission .",
    "no systematic velocity gradient is evident in either the hcn or the hco@xmath1 data - cubes .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that we have not resolved their spatial distributions .",
    "both the hcn and hco@xmath1 emission - line profiles ( figure [ lineprofs ] ) agree reasonably well with that of @xmath0co emission , taking into account their noise levels ( 20 mjy beam@xmath8 per channel for @xmath0co , and 4 mjy beam@xmath8 for hcn and hco@xmath26 ) .",
    "an integrated intensity map of @xmath2co(10 ) emission is presented in figure [ intmaps]d , and emission is detected at the 4.1@xmath27 level .",
    "this is the first image ever of @xmath2co emission from ngc 6240 .",
    "the continuum emission was subtracted from the visibility data before creating the synthesized image .",
    "the flux of the @xmath2co emission is much smaller than those of @xmath0co and hcn .",
    "the obtained total flux is about 60% of the single dish flux obtained by @xcite .",
    "the synthesized beam size of the @xmath2co map ( @xmath23 ) is larger than those of @xmath0co and hcn , and the emission dose not seem to be resolved .",
    "the peak of @xmath2co also coincides with those of @xmath0co , hcn , and hco@xmath1 .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly comment on the emission line intensity ratios , in brightness temperature scale , ) and brightness temperature ( @xmath28 ) is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the observed wavelength , @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath32 is the solid angle of the region in which the line ratio is calculated .",
    "] for the molecular gas concentration between the double nuclei .",
    "taking into account the relatively low spatial resolution of the @xmath2co map , the line ratio is calculated using the integrated fluxes within the region of @xmath23 ( 2.2 kpc @xmath23 1.7 kpc ) , which corresponds to the synthesized beam size of the @xmath2co map .",
    "this area both contains the region between the double nuclei and the double nuclei , themselves .",
    "however , the emissions are almost concentrated between the double nuclei , and the peaks of the observed emission lines coincide with each other .",
    "thus , the line ratios within the @xmath23 region are representative of those between the double nuclei .",
    "the error of each ratio is calculated considering the absolute flux calibration uncertainty for each observation ( 10% ) and the noise level of the emission line maps , except for hco@xmath1/hcn . for the hco@xmath1/hcn ratio , only the noise level of each emission line map is considered , because the hcn and hco@xmath1 line is observed simultaneously within the same passband of the correlator .",
    "we obtained a high hcn/@xmath0co ratio of @xmath33 at the region between the double nuclei .",
    "this contrasts with the total integrated intensity ratio of hcn/@xmath0co = @xmath34 , which agrees with the single - dish values reported by solomon , downes , and radford ( 1992 ) .",
    "the hcn/@xmath0co ratio of 0.25 is higher than the mean ( @xmath35 ) for lirgs and ulirgs , and one of the highest value among them @xcite .",
    "gao and solomon ( 2004a ) show that a large hcn/@xmath0co ( @xmath36 ) is likely to come from regions where most of ( @xmath37 50% ) molecular gas is high density [ @xmath38 @xmath4 based on lvg calculations .",
    "we obtain a hco@xmath1/hcn ratio of @xmath39 .",
    "the typical hco@xmath1/hcn ratio for nearby starburst galaxies and seyfert galaxies with nuclear starbursts is 0.3  2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the value in ngc 6240 is within the range for that of starburst galaxies , but larger than the mean value ( @xmath7 )",
    ". the high hco@xmath1/hcn ratio would be due to the existence of shocked dense gas , of which the envelope is exposed to the intense ionization flux of the supernovae ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the hco@xmath1/hcn ratio of this galaxy will be discussed in a forthcoming paper together with those in the other lirgs and mergers .",
    "the @xmath0co/@xmath2co ratio is @xmath40 at the region between the double nuclei ( 2.2 kpc @xmath23 1.7 kpc ) .",
    "@xcite found that the mean @xmath0co/@xmath2co ratio is @xmath41 in their survey of infrared - bright galaxies .",
    "the ratio in ngc 6240 is thus significantly larger than the mean for starburst galaxies .",
    "some galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 1614 , ic 694 ) show a high ratio of @xmath0co/@xmath2co@xmath42 , and @xcite suggested that such a high ratio could be reproduced by warm turbulent molecular gas ( @xmath43 k ) .",
    "they also maintain that a high @xmath0co/@xmath2co ratio also implies that the optical depth of @xmath0co(10 ) must be moderate [ @xmath44(@xmath0co)@xmath45 and that of @xmath2co(10 ) is very small [ @xmath44(@xmath2co)@xmath46 .",
    "figure [ contmap ] shows both the 87 ghz ( 3.5 mm ) and 108 ghz ( 2.8 mm ) continuum images obtained using the line - free channels of the visibility data in hcn@xmath47hco@xmath1 and @xmath2co observations , respectively . unlike the molecular lines , the continuum emission peak is almost located at the southern nucleus . since the hcn and hco@xmath1 maps and 87 ghz continuum map were created from identical uv - data ,",
    "the difference between the peak positions is real . in the 87 ghz continuum map",
    ", the emission extends more than the size of the synthesized beam ( @xmath23 , which corresponds to 1.7 kpc@xmath231.0 kpc ) .",
    "figure [ contsed ] shows the spectrum of ngc 6240 in the region surrounding the double nuclei ( within @xmath23 , which corresponds to 5.1 kpc@xmath236.5 kpc ) .",
    "the total continuum flux densities at 87 ghz and 108 ghz are 16.6 mjy and 10.8 mjy , respectively .",
    "these values can be reproduced well by assuming a single power - law spectrum ( @xmath48 ) interpolated between the cm - wave continuum emission @xcite and 1.3 mm ( 228 ghz ) emission @xcite .",
    "the best - fit spectral index is @xmath49 , which is within the range of the spectral indices in both synchrotron radiation from agn and that from supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , most of our observed mm - wave continuum emission can be explained by synchrotron radiation from an agn , snrs , or both , come mostly from the bright southern nuclei , but there are surely some contributions from the northern nucleus .",
    "this conclusion supports the discussion by @xcite .    thermal free  free emission from star - forming regions",
    "are also expected to contribute some degree to the mm - wave continuum emission .",
    "based on @xcite and @xcite , the relation of the thermal free  free continuum flux ( @xmath50 ) and far - infrared luminosity ( @xmath51 ) is expressed as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electron temperature . even if we assume all of the fir luminosity from ngc 6240 , @xmath54  @xcite , comes from the nuclear region , then the estimated free ",
    "free emission flux from h ii regions at @xmath55 k is at most @xmath56 mjy at 100 ghz .",
    "this flux value is smaller than the observed flux at 87 ghz and 108 ghz .",
    "moreover , as can be seen in figure [ contsed ] , the spectral index between 100 ghz and 228 ghz is significantly smaller than @xmath57 , which is a typical index for optically thin radio free ",
    "free emission .",
    "therefore , the free - free emission contribution on the 100 ghz continuum flux must be less than 7 mjy .",
    "intensity ratios between molecular emission lines are powerful tools to probe the physical properties of molecular gas . in this section",
    "we compare the observed hcn/@xmath2co intensity ratio with radiative transfer model calculations , to try to constrain the physical properties of the molecular gas between the double nuclei of ngc 6240 .",
    "we have compared the observed hcn/@xmath2co ratio with the outcome of radiative transfer model calculations performed by @xcite based on the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the intense emission of the hcn line and high hcn/@xmath0co ratio ( 0.25 ) imply that most of the molecular gas is dense between the double nuclei @xcite .",
    "hcn emission traces molecular gas at high density [ @xmath58 @xmath4 , and @xmath2co emission is more excited at higher density gas than @xmath0co due to its low optical depth .",
    "thus , the hcn/@xmath2co ratio reflects the physical properties of dense molecular gas better than hcn/@xmath0co ratio @xcite .",
    "figure [ lvgreslt ] shows the contour maps of the intensity ratio , hcn/@xmath2co , as a function of @xmath59/(@xmath60 ) and @xmath61 , where @xmath59 is the fractional abundance of @xmath2co to h@xmath62 and @xmath60 is the velocity gradient in km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 . the kinetic temperature ( @xmath63 ) in each map",
    "is shown in the top - right corner . in the lvg calculation ,",
    "the single - component model was employed , and a constant relative abundance of [ @xmath2co]/[hcn ] = 50 was adopted @xcite . the full description of the lvg calculation is presented in @xcite .    as can be seen in figure [ lvgreslt ] , the observed high ratio , hcn/@xmath2co = @xmath64 , can be reproduced in dense and warm molecular clouds . in the upper two panels showing kinetic temperatures higher than 50 k , the ratio can only be reproduced by dense gas conditions , @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "the optical depth of @xmath2co emission under the dense and warm conditions is very small ( 0.01  0.1 ) in the panels of @xmath67 k and 100 k , as suggested by @xcite .    to explain the high hcn/@xmath2co ratio under a lower gas kinetic temperature ( @xmath68 k ) , extremely small values of @xmath59/(@xmath60 ) [ @xmath69 ( km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8)@xmath8 ] would be required",
    "this would happen if the velocity gradient is extremely large ( @xmath70 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 ) , or the @xmath2co abundance is very low [ @xmath71 .",
    "if a @xmath2co abundance of @xmath72 ( @xcite ) is adopted , a velocity gradient of @xmath70 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 is needed to meet the extremely small @xmath59/(@xmath60 ) value . as we show now , this velocity gradient is , however , too large and unrealistic .",
    "we made a simple estimate of the velocity gradient from the @xmath0co emission data .",
    "@xcite reported that , at the peak of @xmath0co(21 ) emission , the line width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) is about 1000 km s@xmath8 in a @xmath23 (= 330pc @xmath23 240pc ) beam . assuming that the @xmath0co emission originated from a single molecular clump having the same size as the observed beam , the velocity gradient is nominally estimated to be @xmath73 km s@xmath8pc@xmath8 .",
    "even if the size of molecular clump were 50 pc ( typical for galactic giant molecular clouds ) , the estimated velocity gradient would be @xmath74 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 , which is still quite smaller than the value above .",
    "therefore , the extremely large velocity gradient as @xmath70 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 is not realistic .",
    "we now discuss the possibility that the @xmath2co abundance is quite low . in the calculations for figure [ lvgreslt ] , a constant relative abundance of [",
    "@xmath2co]/[hcn]=50 was used .",
    "the hcn/@xmath2co ratio hardly depends on the hcn abundance [ @xmath75/(@xmath60 ) ] because of the large optical depth of hcn ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a low @xmath2co abundance can reproduce high hcn/@xmath2co ratios .",
    "the `` standard abundance '' @xmath72 is obtained based on observations of molecular clouds in the inner galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the @xmath2co abundance at the centers of other galaxies are still not very well constrained , there appears to be little difference between the galaxy and others ( e.g. @xcite , , ) .",
    "the galaxy  galaxy merging may cause a low @xmath2co abundance in the galactic center . the molecular gas in the disk of merging progenitors",
    "are predicted to converge into the centers of each of the original galaxies @xcite . in the galaxy ,",
    "the @xmath0c/@xmath2c abundance ratio becomes larger toward the outer disk than in the galactic center , but the difference is only a factor of @xmath76 ( @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0co/@xmath2co abundance ratio will not largely differ from that of the @xmath0c/@xmath2c ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the low @xmath2co abundance might somewhat contribute to the high hcn/@xmath2co ratio , but the extremely low @xmath2co abundance [ @xmath71 can not be realized .",
    "selective dissociation of the @xmath2co molecule might play a role , but the abundance of @xmath2co is supposed to be affected little @xcite .    from the above considerations , it seems to be quite reasonable to conclude that the molecular gas is dense [ @xmath77 @xmath4 and warm ( @xmath78 k ) between the double nuclei of ngc 6240 .",
    "our results are also consistent with the fact that the analysis of the spectral energy distributions from the infrared to the sub - mm suggests a significant amount of warm ( @xmath79 k ) dust in ngc 6240 ( @xcite ) . to confirm the high - temperature condition of the molecular gas",
    "positively , observations of higher excitation @xmath0co and @xmath2co emission should be performed .",
    "it is expected that the @xmath0co/@xmath2co ratio in @xmath8021 and 32 show values smaller than that of @xmath81=10 ( cf .",

    "@xcite obtained interferometric maps of @xmath0co , @xmath2co , and hcn ( 10 ) toward the lirg merger arp 299 ( ic 694+ngc 3690 ) in  ( 460  1090 pc ) resolutions . at the nucleus of ic 694 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath0co/@xmath2co is 60 , the ratio hcn/@xmath0co is 0.11 , and the ratio hcn/@xmath2co is 6.7 .",
    "these ratios are similar to those of ngc 6240 .",
    "single - dish @xmath2co(21 ) observations toward ic 694 have also been performed by @xcite ; they concluded that the molecular gas consists of a dense [ @xmath85 @xmath4 and warm ( @xmath78 k ) medium based on a high @xmath2co(21)/(10 ) ratio ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "these previous results imply that the estimated properties of the molecular gas in ngc 6240 are common for starburst and merging galaxies .",
    "as we have shown in previous sections , ngc 6240 has a large amount of dense and warm molecular gas in the central region .",
    "the dense molecular gas distribution , however , does not coincide with that of the massive star - forming regions .",
    "figure [ hcnonfeii ] shows our hcn map superimposed on the distribution of nir [ fe ii ] ( left panel ) and h@xmath62 ( right panel ) emissions .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the hcn peak agrees well with the h@xmath62 peak rather than the [ fe ii ] peak .",
    "the [ fe ii ] emission is supposed to be generated in fast shocks from supernova remnants @xcite , and is thus supposed to follow the current massive star forming regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath62 emission arise from hot molecular hydrogen excited by large - scale shock rather than uv fluorescence or x - ray heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dense gas traced by the hcn and hco@xmath1 emissions are concentrated between the double nuclei ( see also figure [ intmaps ] ) , whereas the massive star - forming regions traced by nir [ fe ii ] , pa@xmath87 , and br@xmath88 emission lines are associated with both of the nuclei ( @xcite ) .",
    "usually the dense molecular gas is located at current massive star - forming regions in the central region of starburst galaxies and seyferts @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with what we have observed in ngc 6240 .",
    "we provide a possible illustration to explain this discrepancy in the next subsection .      here , we propose a possible scenario to explain the evolution of the molecular gas and star formation in ngc 6240 .",
    "the origin of the unusual discrepancy between the dense gas distribution and the star - forming regions is also illustrated within it .",
    "this scenario is based on our observational results together with those of others and results from numerical simulations of galaxy  galaxy merging .",
    "a brief summary of the scenario is as follows : 1 ) during a galaxy  galaxy interaction , dense molecular gas is formed and intense star formation occurs in the circumnuclear regions of each of the merger progenitor galaxies , 2 ) an almost head - on collision or very close encounter of the nuclei cause the merging of the two dense gas concentrations , 3 ) the star - forming nuclei can still remain separate while the single dense gas concentration is left behind between them ( this is the present view of ngc 6240 ) , 4 ) a new and intense star formation will begin at some period in the dense molecular gas concentration .",
    "we describe this scenario in more detail following the order of events .      at the early merging stages , the molecular gas pre - existing in the merger progenitor galaxies accumulate toward their respective galactic centers approaching each other .",
    "the gas accumulation probably results in the formation of dense molecular gas and nuclear starburst detected by the nir observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "n - body simulations of galaxy  galaxy merging show that gas inflow , driven by gravitational torques , will cause condensations of gas clouds around the nuclei of both original galaxies @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations also predict that the gas accumulation in each of the nuclei probably lead to considerable amount of dense molecular gas formation , which is able to cause star - formation activities within it .",
    "for example , in the merging galaxy arp 299 , most of the molecular gas is concentrated toward the nuclei @xcite , and the nuclei harbor intense star formation activity @xcite .",
    "in the course of the merging process , the progenitor nuclei accompanied by dense gas concentration may suffer a nearly head - on collision or very close encounter . in the case that the impact parameter was smaller than the gas concentrations ( @xmath89 kpc ) , although the nuclei and associated stellar systems can remain gravitationally bounded , the dense molecular gas would be stripped off from the nuclei and form a single molecular gas condensation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these events ultimately lead the nuclei to be deficient in dense molecular gas , while almost terminating the nuclear star formation .",
    "we apply this to ngc 6240 , and try to make a rough estimate of the time - scale of the collision / encounter using the relative velocity and distance between the double nuclei .",
    "the projected relative velocity is measured to be @xmath90 km s@xmath8 from the stellar absorption and @xmath91 km s@xmath8 from the br@xmath88 emission @xcite ; thus , the actual relative velocity is assumed to be on the order of 100 km s@xmath8 . from the 15 ghz continuum image @xcite ,",
    "the projected distance of the double nuclei is 710 pc .",
    "if our viewing angle is , then the actual separation of the nuclei is about 1 kpc .",
    "if we adopt 100 km s@xmath8 for the relative velocity and 1 kpc for the distance , it takes about @xmath92 yr for the double nuclei to move from the pericenter to the present positions .",
    "@xcite estimated that the actual orbital velocity and separation between the double nuclei are 155 km s@xmath8 and 1.4 kpc , respectively .",
    "they are very close to our assumed values .",
    "this time - scale is consistent with the age of the nuclear star formation .",
    "the latest star - formation activity is estimated to be suspended for 11.5 @xmath93 yr ago from the results of the stellar population synthesis based on the optical and nir spectroscopic observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "after collision / encounter , the double nuclei leave each other from the pericenter , and the dense molecular gas concentration remains between the double nuclei .",
    "some recently formed massive stars exist around the nuclei , but the major part of nuclear star - formation activities have already faded out because of the deficiency of dense molecular gas .",
    "this is the present view of ngc 6240 .",
    "the molecular gas concentration shows a velocity gradient within it ; the north side is redshifted with respect to the south ( see figure [ copvmap ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the orbital motions of the double nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the velocity gradient originates from the rotational motion of the gas concentration . in a perfect head - on collision ,",
    "the merged gas is expected to have no systematic velocity structure .",
    "but , in the case of an offset head - on collision or a very close encounter , the orbital angular momentum of dense gas in the pre - collision phase will remain as the rotational motion of the merged gas concentration . in our scenario ,",
    "the observed velocity gradient can be explained as such rotational motion .",
    "the molecular gas between the double nuclei is not only dense , but also warm .",
    "there is no sign of intense massive star formation or prominent agn activity between the double nuclei , and thus ultraviolet radiation from them should not be a principal heating source .",
    "one probable heating source is dynamical energy sources , that is to say , turbulence and shocks .",
    "the large velocity width of the molecular emission lines and complicated distributions of molecular gas imply the existence of large turbulence within the dense gas concentrations @xcite .",
    "extraordinary bright shock excited nir h@xmath62 emission has been detected in this object ( @xcite ) , and the h@xmath62 peak agrees well with that of the dense gas concentration ( see figure [ hcnonfeii ] ) .",
    "these facts imply that the large turbulence and the intense shocks causes a high molecular gas temperature .",
    "a brand - new starburst will begin in the dense gas concentration in the near future .",
    "@xcite estimated the dissipation time - scale for random velocities within the gas concentration to be @xmath94 yr , and suggest that ngc 6240 may experience the next major starburst within the gas concentration .",
    "some external effects on the dense gas might also proceed star - formation . the `` starburst driven starburst '' proposed by @xcite is one of the possible mechanisms .",
    "dense gas clumps can collapse under high external pressure caused by the starburst driven super - wind from the double nuclei @xcite , and massive star - formation will be induced in them .",
    "star formation within the dense gas concentration may have already commenced , but it is very young ( @xmath95 yr ) and suffering from large interstellar absorption because of huge amounts of interstellar medium .",
    "there exists a hint that the starburst activity should not be older than several @xmath96 yr , if the starburst has already begun .",
    "there is no evident sign of strong supernova explosions , because of the weakness of cm - wave radio continuum emission and nir [ fe ] emission between the double nuclei @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) spectroscopic observations with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) revealed that the star - forming regions in ngc 6240 suffer from large interstellar extinction .",
    "the extinction toward the star - forming regions , estimated from the emission line flux ratio between mir [ ne ii ] and nir br@xmath88 , is @xmath9715  20 mag ( corresponding to @xmath98 1.5  2 mag ) in the simplified screen assumption ( @xcite ) .",
    "this estimation is larger ( 10  15 mag in @xmath99 ) than the extinction derived from optical and nir spectroscopic observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the spatial distributions seen even at the nir wavelength ( [ fe ii ] , pa@xmath87 , and br@xmath88 emission lines ) may not totally trace star - forming regions deeply obscured by the interstellar medium .",
    "although the location of an obscured star - forming region has not been identified yet because the iso aperture ( @xmath100 ) covers the whole nuclear region of ngc 6240 , a young star - forming region may hide in the dense molecular gas concentration between the double nuclei .",
    "we have carried out high spatial - resolution observations of molecular lines toward the infrared luminous merger ngc 6240 using the nma and the rainbow interferometers .",
    "the @xmath0co emission peak lies between the double nuclei of this galaxy ; our results confirm the previous interferometric @xmath0co(10/21 ) observations .",
    "our new high - resolution hcn and hco@xmath1 observations reveal that the emissions are also peaked between the double nuclei , and are not spatially resolved with our beam size of .",
    "the ratio hcn/@xmath0co is as high as 0.25 in the region between the double nuclei",
    ". the @xmath2co emission has also been observed , and it turns out to be much weaker than others .",
    "the comparison between the high ratio hcn/@xmath2co = 5.9 and the lvg calculations suggests that the molecular gas is substantially dense and warm .",
    "the estimated molecular hydrogen density and kinetic temperature are @xmath3 @xmath66 and @xmath78 k , respectively .",
    "these physical properties are similar to those seen at the centers of the nearby starburst galaxies and infrared luminous mergers .",
    "the observed characteristics that most of the dense and warm gas in ngc 6240 is located between the starburst nuclei is very unusual among the infrared luminous mergers observed so far .",
    "we propose a scenario to explain the evolution of dense molecular gas and starbursts , and to resolve the discrepancy between their locations in ngc 6240 . in our scenario ,",
    "a head - on collision or very close encounter of the star - forming nuclei caused the merging of dense molecular gas associated with both nuclei .",
    "at the present moment , the double star - forming nuclei are still apart from each other , but a dense and warm molecular gas concentration has been left between them . in the near future , a new starburst is expected to commence within the dense gas concentration .",
