    "chemotaxis @xcite and brownian motion @xcite belong to the key processes which govern the motility of microorganisms ( e.g. bacteria , amoeba and endothelial cells ) @xcite . in the simplest approach ,",
    "the microbe  smells \" a chemical and moves along the gradient of the concentration field of the chemoattractant in order to reach efficiently the secretion source of the chemical . the opposite case of negative chemotaxis is realized in case the microbe intends to avoid another object which is secreting the chemical @xcite .",
    "this chemotactic drift is superimposed to stochastic motion due to fluctuations associated with the active process of self - propulsion of the microorganism @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis can lead to clusters of aggregated bacteria @xcite which are still emitting chemoattractant .",
    "here we study the self - coupled situation where the microorganism  smells \" itself , i.e. it reacts chemotactically to its own secreted chemical .",
    "autochemotaxis \" is realized in aggregated clusters of different bacteria if the aggregate is considered as a net particle .",
    "another realization is a single bacterium which has both an emitter and a sensor of the same chemical .",
    "tsori and de gennes @xcite have studied a simple model for this situation in different spatial dimensions @xmath1 and find self - trapping of the bacterium in its own chemoattractant cloud for @xmath2 but not for @xmath3 .",
    "this means that for low dimensionality the bacterium is fooled by its own secretion such that it is getting localized for long times . in a subsequent numerical study of a model microbe coupled to its own",
    "chemoattractant secreted at constant rate , grima @xcite calculated the long - time dynamics in various dimensions @xmath1 and found long - time diffusive behavior even for @xmath2 in contradiction to ref .",
    "grima also studied the case of negative chemotaxis and finds in all dimensions long - time diffusion or ballistic motion depending on the strength @xmath4 which couples the microbe s driving force to the gradient of the chemical concentration field .",
    "grima predicts that if @xmath5 exceeds a critical value @xmath6 , then the long - time motion is super - diffusive .    in this paper",
    "we revisit autochemotaxis by studying a model which is similar but not identical to that proposed by grima @xcite . in the model of grima ,",
    "a finite global extinction rate ( @xmath7 ) of the secreted chemical is present .",
    "here we focus on the case @xmath8 , which can be realized in experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) . by extensive computer simulations ,",
    "we study different spatial dimensions @xmath0 and both cases of positive and negative chemotaxis .",
    "our results are summarized as follows : consistent with grima @xcite , we find for positive chemotaxis ( i.e.  for a coupling parameter @xmath9 ) long - time diffusive motion .",
    "in addition we find _ dynamical transients _ before reaching the long - time diffusive limit . during the transients , the dynamics of the microorganism",
    "is strongly reduced resulting in almost dynamical arrest . the crossover time from intermediate arrest to long - time diffusion grows strongly with the coupling @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the idealized analysis of tsori and de gennes who predicted self - trapping ( i.e.  a complete dynamical arrest ) is manifested by long transients for very strong couplings @xcite .",
    "the averaged mean - square displacement as a function of time does not exhibit a universal slope in this transient regime , but the actual mean slope is decreasing with an increase in the coupling @xmath10 . the transient behavior is most pronounced in one dimension but weakened considerably in three dimensions .    for negative chemotaxis ( i.e. dynamical self - avoiding of the microbe ) , on the other hand , we find transient ballistic motion in all dimensions . in @xmath11",
    "we observe a long - time diffusion for all coupling strength . such long - time diffusive motion in @xmath12 , though not directly observed in the simulation , is possible by finite probability of changing the direction of motion ( left to right ) at long time scales for non - zero temperature .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the critical coupling @xmath6 above which ballistic long - time behavior is found depends on the global extinction rate @xmath7 but stays finite when @xmath13 .",
    "one reason for the discrepancy is because noise has not been completely included in the earlier treatments @xcite , while solving for the integrals concerning the non - markovian chemotactic force . we take note of the effect of noise on the microbe s trajectory in an appropriate place in this paper ( for another example demonstrating",
    "the importance of noise , see ref .",
    "again we address the transient behavior and find an intermediate time window where the super - diffusive motion is found between a short - time and long - time diffusive behavior .",
    "this motion we observe is similar to persistent random walk of a microbe which can be mapped to the worm - like chain model @xcite . in the particular case we consider ,",
    "the persistence length is seen to depend on the microbe s coupling with the repellent .",
    "our predictions can in principle be verified in experiments on aggregates of bacteria .",
    "for many bacteria our model reduces to particles interacting via gravitation - kind potentials for @xmath3 .",
    "therefore our analysis might have applications for brownian dynamics of gravitational matter @xcite .",
    "further generalizations of our model are to predator and prey models possibly leading to interesting spatiotemporal delay effects , see e.g.  @xcite .    our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we propose the model of a microorganism coupled to its own chemoattractant / chemorepellent , provide the simulation details and point out experimental situations to compare typical estimates of parameters used in the model . in section iii we present the results of our investigation . in section",
    "iv we explain our findings with simple theoretical analysis .",
    "we conclude the paper in section v by discussing the main points of our findings , comparisons of our results with relevant practical cases of self - propulsion , and future directions of our research .",
    "_ model : _ the microorganism is modeled as a point particle which undergoes completely overdamped brownian motion with an effective temperature @xmath14 in a medium with viscosity coefficient @xmath15 .",
    "this ` particle ' is assumed to emit a chemical , with which it is self - coupled , continuously in time . in this context , the word ` particle ' is thereby taken to represent the chemotactic agent of interest - an idealized microorganism coupled with a self - emitted chemical field .",
    "fluctuations associated with the active process of self - propulsion of the microbe is modeled by the effective temperature parameter @xmath14 in our system .",
    "the time evolution of the density field @xmath16 of the continuously emitted chemical is thus governed by a diffusion equation with a source term which depends upon the instantaneous position @xmath17 of the moving microbe : @xmath18 here , the constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rate of emission of the chemical and the diffusion constant of the chemical in the medium , respectively .    in the absence of chemical ,",
    "the microbe diffuses non - chemotactically in the medium with an effective free diffusion constant @xmath21",
    ". however , with the presence of the emitted chemical the resulting ` chemotactic ' behavior depends on the nature of the self - coupling of the microorganism to its chemical field , i.e. whether it moves ` up ' or ` down ' the chemical density gradient .",
    "we study both cases by simply modeling the self - coupling ` force ' to be proportional to the gradient of the chemical density field @xmath22 , and the proportionality constant @xmath10 determines the strength as well as the nature of the coupling . in reality , of course , chemotaxis can be more complex involving temporally sampling of the concentration field and a biased random walk @xcite . in this context , we note that the ` chemotactic force ' imitates the net effect of chemotactic movements on a phenomenological level .",
    "the details of the actual propulsion mechanism @xcite of the chemotactic agent and the effect of the solvent flow field on the diffusing chemical are not taken into account . within our simple model , positive and negative @xmath10",
    "naturally generate the cases of positive and negative chemotaxes , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : rd ] ) for the density field @xmath33 by the method of green s function , and subsequently calculating the gradient @xmath22 . the ` force ' at a time instant is dependent on the entire previous path history of the microorganism , thereby generating a strongly non - markovian dynamics . however , owing to a physical _ memory time _ ( @xmath34 ) associated with the microbe to sense its chemical , the part of the trajectory in this most recent time @xmath34 , i.e. for all @xmath35 with @xmath36 , does not contribute .",

    "in conclusion , we have explored the dynamics of autochemotaxis : a model microorganism is  smelling \" its own secretion which is diffusing away .",
    "the microorganism follows the gradient @xcite of its secreted chemical . for the attractive case",
    ", the mean - square displacement of the microorganism reveals a transient dynamical arrest , most pronounced in low spatial dimensionality . in the opposite case of chemorepulsion",
    ", there is a transient ballistic behavior which crosses over to ultimate diffusion @xcite .",
    "a simple theoretical analysis for large coupling strengths @xmath10 reveals a scaling law for the long - time diffusion in the case of a chemoattractant , by regarding small excursions of the microbe s position about the bottom of an effective , time - dependent trapping potential . in the case of chemorepulsion",
    ", the microbe s trajectory was mapped to the contour of a worm - like chain , which gives a semiquantitative agreement with our computer simulations .",
    "the ranges of the coupling strength reported here are also easily obtainable in real experimental situations ( @xmath203 ) , as estimated earlier in the text .",
    "we note that though the mechanism of temporal sensing @xcite of chemoattractant or chemorepellent which we do not consider here is found in many small , fast moving bacteria like _ e. coli _ , the direct gradient sensing mechanism is also present in microorganisms like the amoeba _ dictyostelium discoideum _ , the yeast cell _ saccharomyces carevisiae _ , lymphocytes , glial cells and myxobacteria @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis in the gliding bacterium _",
    "m. xanthus _ was demonstrated to be in response to self - generated signaling chemicals @xcite . however , the diffusivity of the chemoattractant is significantly lower compared with the bacterial motility in this peculiar case .",
    "a numerical investigation @xcite of a simple model case in one - dimension compared the interplay between chemotaxis and chemokinesis mechanism with a concentration dependent switching rate , showing crossover from suppressed to enhanced diffusion in the parameter space .",
    "this mean - field approach , studied in the limit of vanishing chemical diffusivity and chemical degradation rate , was based on the simplifying assumption that the chemical coupling only affects the frequency of direction reversal of the cell , keeping the cell speed unaltered .",
    "models of active colloids using surface reactions as a potential mechanism for self - propulsion has been proposed ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model _ molecular machine _ is a spherical colloid which reacts with the substrate at a specific site on its surface and self - propel by asymmetric release of the reaction product .",
    "the time evolution of the product particles is similar to that of chemical molecules emitted by a microorganism .",
    "though the exact way of imparting a biased motion to the colloid by the emitted particles is very different from chemotactic coupling , such systems may also provide interesting situations to compare with our results .",
    "in fact in ref .",
    "@xcite , active colloids interacting with a self - generated cloud of solute were shown to have distinct propulsive and anomalous super - diffusive regimes preceding a final long - time effective diffusion .",
    "this is worth comparing with the ballistic to a modified diffusion crossover in our study on negative autochemotaxis .",
    "future work should focus on generalizing the model to a collection of model microorganisms @xcite , where hydrodynamic flow effects can play an important role @xcite and steric repulsions can lead to aggregation and clumps @xcite as known from active particles @xcite .",
    "it would further be interesting to study the case of a geometric confinement of the particles @xcite and the chemoattractant / repellent in order to see effects of a dimensional crossover .",
