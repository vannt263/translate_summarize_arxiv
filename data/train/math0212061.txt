    "calabi - yau manifolds of dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. elliptic curves and k3-surfaces , have a long and successful tradition in geometry and number theory . in the 1980 s , in connection with developments in string theory , calabi - yau manifolds of dimension @xmath4 moved to the forefront . emphasis has been on their complex and symplectic geometry , and in particular on the variation of the hodge structure for calabi - yau threefolds near the so - called large complex structure limit .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers in which we want to describe certain aspects of the arithmetic geometry of families of ordinary calabi - yau threefolds and analogies with complex calabi - yau threefolds near the large complex structure limit .",
    "more specifically , this paper discusses the associated crystals , i.e. modules with an integrable connection , like the gauss - manin connection on the cohomology of a family of calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "crystals which originate from geometry come with a hodge filtration , which is not preserved by the connection but instead satisfies griffiths transversality .",
    "crystals which originate from geometry in characteristic @xmath1 additionally carry an action of frobenius operators behaving in an appropriate way with respect to the connection and the hodge filtration : they are divisible hodge @xmath5-crystals . for so - called divisible _",
    "hodge @xmath5-crystals the space of flat sections decomposes into eigenspaces for the frobenius operators .",
    "the position of the hodge filtration with respect to this eigenspace decomposition is the source for the canonical coordinates and the yukawa coupling : see theorems [ thmstructure ] , [ cy3structure ] , [ integralities ] .",
    "the ordinariness requirement implies , exactly as the requirement of maximally unipotent local monodromy in the traditional analysis of complex calabi - yau threefolds near the large complex structure limit @xcite , that there is a _ filtration which is opposite to the hodge filtration and is invariant under the gauss - manin connection and whose associated graded is of hodge - tate type _",
    "@xcite prop.1.3.6 , @xcite  6 ) .",
    "the theory of ordinary hodge @xmath5-crystals has its origins in dwork s work on the variation of the zeta function in a family of varieties over a finite field @xcite and in the work of serre and tate on the formal moduli of deformations of an ordinary elliptic curve over a field of positive characteristic . in @xcite deligne and illusie",
    "present a general theory of ordinary hodge @xmath5-crystals and apply it to investigate the formal moduli of ordinary abelian varieties and ordinary k3-surfaces .",
    "the general theory works equally well for ordinary cy3 crystals , i.e. crystals of the kind that arises as the crystalline cohomology of ordinary calabi - yau threefolds in characteristic @xmath0 .",
    "thus , exactly as in @xcite , there are canonical coordinates on the formal moduli space . in section [ section 1 ]",
    "we briefly recall the general theory of @xcite . in section 2",
    "we take the same algebraic path as bryant , griffiths , morrison and deligne @xcite in their analysis of the variation of the hodge structure of complex calabi - yau threefolds near a maximally degenerate ( @xmath6 maximally unipotent local monodromy @xmath6 large complex structure ) boundary point of the moduli space . in particular",
    "we find for ordinary cy3 crystals an exact analog of the cubic form of bryant - griffiths ( @xmath6 yukawa coupling ) .",
    "interestingly , besides the standard characterization ( [ eq : yukawa ] ) of the prepotential of this cubic form we find a characterization ( [ eq : yukinnerproduct ] ) by means of the action of the canonical lift of frobenius .",
    "the latter characterization remains valid if there are no parameters , i.e. if @xmath7 in ( [ eq : a ] ) , while in that case the former description is vacuous .",
    "also for the canonical coordinates the formalisms in the ordinary and the large complex structure situations match very well , but the match is not perfect : in the ordinary case the canonical coordinates take the value @xmath2 at the origin of the deformation space ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : canorig ] ) ) , whereas the canonical coordinates at the large complex structure limit point vanish .    the standard algorithms ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for computing canonical coordinates and yukawa coupling for complex calabi - yau threefolds near the `` maximally unipotent local monodromy boundary point '' use special solutions of the picard - fuchs equations associated with the family of cy3 s and a nowhere vanishing global @xmath4-form . in remark [ picard - fuchs ]",
    "we point out that in the ordinary case one has basically the same relation between canonical coordinates , yukawa coupling and special solutions of the picard - fuchs equations ( although explicit computations seem here out of reach ) .",
    "the present paper is a survey of structures none which  except maybe ( [ eq : yukinnerproduct ] ) and ( [ eq : yukinteger ] )  is new by itself , but which appear in the literature in different contexts .",
    "so we hope that there is an inspiring and cross - fertilizing effect from putting them into one ( con)text . for instance , being alerted that for the deformation theory of ordinary calabi - yau threefolds the cubic form of bryant - griffiths ( yukawa coupling ) should be relevant , one may wonder how that shows up in connection with the hodge - tate decomposition of @xmath1-adic tale cohomology as in @xcite p. 109 .",
    "the original motivation for our work was to find a general method of proof for the integrality conjectures in mirror symmetry by reducing them to known results or easy to check conditions on the crystalline cohomology for families of calabi - yau threefolds in positive characteristics : it has been observed in many examples in the literature on mirror symmetry for calabi - yau threefolds , that the coefficients in appropriate expansions of the canonical coordinates and of the prepotential of the yukawa coupling are integers . in the famous example of the quintics in @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) one has for instance @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the parameter and @xmath11 is the canonical coordinate of the family @xmath12 the yukawa coupling @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 @xmath15 the prepotential @xmath16 is defined ( up to terms of order @xmath17 in @xmath18 ) by @xmath19 and has an expansion @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the trilogarithm function .",
    "according to the mirror symmetry conjecture @xcite the number @xmath22 is the number of rational curves of degree @xmath23 on a generic quintic hypersurface in @xmath8 .",
    "for the integrality conjecture one is interested in the less astonishing , but still highly non - trivial fact that these numbers are integers .",
    "now one may note that the numbers @xmath22 are integers if and only if for every prime number @xmath1 @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the ring of @xmath1-adic integers .    in this paper we show that @xmath1-adic analogues of the integrality conjectures , in particular an analogue of ( [ eq : exa.quintic ] ) , hold true for ordinary cy3 crystals ; see formulas ( [ eq : qprops ] ) and ( [ eq : yukinteger ] ) .. ] throughout this paper the prime @xmath1 is fixed and the constructions involve choices which may depend on @xmath1 . for the integrality conjectures for families of calabi - yau threefolds , like the above quintics",
    ", one must however deal with all primes .",
    "thus one is confronted with the challenge to ` glue ' or to ` synchronize ' those choices for the various primes @xmath1 .",
    "in @xcite we will describe the beginnings of such a synchronized set - up for `` ordinariness '' .",
    "the present paper starts at the fairly abstract heights of @xmath5-crystals and wants to find out from there whether the path of ordinariness leads to interesting vistas .",
    "in @xcite we will start at a less abstract more geometric level .",
    "we recall the theory of ordinary hodge @xmath5-crystals ; the general reference is @xcite .",
    "we work over a perfect field @xmath26 of characteristic @xmath0 and explicitly keep track of which results require passing to the algebraic closure @xmath27 of @xmath26 .",
