    "coherent states were introduced by schr \" odinger in 1926 since the early stages of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "these quantum states are characterized by the fact that the trajectory of the center of the coherent wave packet evolves in time in the same way as a classical harmonic oscillator and its dispersion takes the minimum value allowed by heisenberg s principle .",
    "these facts make them especially useful as a link between the classical and the quantum theories .",
    "much later , in 1963 , glauber introduced the _ field _",
    "coherent states , that is , coherent states for the electromagnetic field .",
    "these states play an important role in quantum optics@xcite .",
    "the development of lasers made it possible to prepare light fields which are very close to the coherent states .",
    "glauber showed that the field coherent states can be obtained from any one of the three mathematical definitions : ( i ) as the right hand eigenstates of the boson annihilation operator @xmath2 with @xmath3 a complex number , ( ii ) as those states obtained by application of the displacement operator upon the vacuum state of the harmonic oscillator @xmath4 with @xmath5 , and ( iii ) as the quantum states with a minimum uncertainty product @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the coherent states obtained from any one of these definitions are identical when one makes use of the harmonic oscillator algebra .",
    "subject to a linear interaction a coherent state evolves into a new coherent state , that is , they show temporal stability @xcite . nieto and simmons @xcite generalized the notion of coherent states for potentials different from the harmonic oscillator with unequally spaced energy levels such as the morse potential and the pschl - teller potential .",
    "the resulting states are localized , follow the classical motion and disperse as little as possible in time .",
    "gazeau and klauder @xcite proposed a generalization for systems with one degree of freedom possessing discrete as well as continuous spectra .",
    "these states present continuity of labeling , a resolution of the identity and temporal stability .",
    "manko and collaborators @xcite introduced coherent states of an @xmath8-deformed algebra as eigenstates of a deformed annihilation operator @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a function of the number operator that specifies the deformation .",
    "these states present nonclassical properties like squeezing and antibunching .",
    "the properties of their even and odd combinations have also been studied @xcite .    in the presence of a nonlinear interaction , field",
    "coherent states evolve into non classical states .",
    "this can be achieved experimentally by passing a coherent state through a kerr medium resulting in the appearance of distinguishable macroscopic superpositions of coherent states , the so called cat states @xcite .",
    "the parametric harmonic oscillator , namely a harmonic oscillator with a time dependent frequency , has been studied from several points of view : using the method of adiabatic invariants @xcite , super symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , algebraic methods @xcite , and different approximation methods @xcite .",
    "a particularly relevant realization of the parametric oscillator is cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) where the frequency of a given field mode in the cavity can change in time due to the motion of the cavity walls or to changes in the dielectric function of the medium @xcite .",
    "for instance , wineland et .",
    "@xcite analyzed both theoretically and experimentally the loss of coherence caused by fluctuations in the trap parameters and in the amplitude and frequency of the laser beams , heating due to collisions with background gas , internal state decoherence due to radiative decay , and coupling to spectator levels .    in this work",
    "we consider a nonlinear system corresponding to a single mode field propagating in a kerr - like medium immersed in a cavity with a time dependent frequency . in section [ sec - theory ]",
    "we write the hamiltonian and construct its time evolution operator . in section [ sec - stats ]",
    "we follow the evolution of coherent states under the nonlinear hamiltonian and analyze some of their statistical properties .",

    "the hamiltonian can be written in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the time evolution operator corresponding to the non linear time independent part of the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath26 and we can write the time dependent hamiltonian in the interaction picture as @xmath27 where we have used the fact that @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the effective frequency @xmath30 is a function of the number operator .    notice that the time evolution operator @xmath31 is exact and includes the anharmonicity due to the kerr medium explicitly .",
    "the interaction picture hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "[ eq : hi ] is also exact .",
    "the operators given in the interaction picture hamiltonian do close under commutation , however they have an explicit time dependence and the wei - norman theorem can not be applied .",
    "nevertheless the set @xmath32 also forms the basis of a lie algebra ( the @xmath33 algebra ) closed under commutation . in order to attain a more manageable hamiltonian that can be written as a linear combination of time independent operators we approximate the exponentials by their average value @xcite , that is",
