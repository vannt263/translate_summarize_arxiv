    "a granular system consisting of macroscopic particles exhibits extremely rich phenomena , which has been studied both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",

    ", the granular particles simultaneously separate into dense and dilute regions , which will not occur for gaseous particles , due to the dissipative nature of the macroscopic particle collision .",

    "both the symmetric and asymmetric states are stable .",
