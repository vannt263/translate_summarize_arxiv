    "pairing plays a very prominent role in nuclear structure physics .",

    ", it is possible to define similar operators for d - wave pairing situations .",
    "over the years considerable attention was paid to exactly solvable pairing hamiltonians with one- and two - body interactions .",
    "these cases include    * the exact quasi - spin limit @xcite : @xmath7 * richardson s solution for the case when the single particle energies are added to the hamiltonian in eq.([5 ] ) @xcite @xmath8 * most general separable case with two orbitals @xcite .",
    "let us first examine the degenerate case .",
    "it is convenient to define the operators @xmath9 then the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) can be written as @xmath10 in the 1970 s talmi @xcite showed that under certain assumptions , a state of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the particle vacuum , is an eigenstate of a class of hamiltonians including the one above .",
    "indeed @xmath13 how can we identify other one - pair states , which are eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) ?",
    "for example for two levels @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the state orthogonal to the one in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) @xmath16 is also an eigenstate with e=0 .",
    "it turns out that there is a systematic way to find such states .",
    "first one introduces the operators @xmath17 ( note that the operators in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) are the same as the operators in eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) calculated at @xmath18 ) .",
    "then one can show that @xcite @xmath19 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) with energy @xmath20 if the following bethe ansatz equations are satisfied : @xmath21 similarly @xmath22 is an eigenstate with zero energy if the following bethe ansatz equations are satisfied : @xmath23 it should be emphasized that the states in eqs .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) are eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) if available single - particle levels are at most half full .",
    "one can show that , if the single - particle levels are more than half full , the state @xmath24 ) if the bethe ansatz equations given in eq.([16 ] ) are satisfied @xcite . in eq . ( [ 19 ] ) @xmath25 designates the state where all single - particle levels are completely filled .",
    "one should emphasize that although the solutions presented here are exact solutions , to obtain explicit expressions for the energies and eigenstates , one still needs to obtain solutions of the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "so far methods to solve the bethe ansatz equations were developed only in a limited number of cases @xcite .",
    "note that it is also possible to calculate the quantum invariants of these pairing hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the above discussion indicates that the states of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) with @xmath26 pairs ( eq . [ 14 ] ) and with @xmath27 pairs ( eq . [ 17 ] ) have the same eigenenergy .",
    "furthermore the zero energy states are missing if the single - particle states are more than half full .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the spectral conditions of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "indeed introducing the operator @xcite @xmath28 which transforms the empty single - particle state , @xmath12 , to the fully occupied state , @xmath25 : @xmath29 one can define new operators @xmath30 supersymmetric quantum mechanics tells us that the partner hamiltonians @xmath31 and @xmath32 have identical spectra except for the extremal ( usually ground ) state of @xmath33 . here two hamiltonians @xmath33 and @xmath34 are actually identical and equal to the pairing hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "hence the role of the supersymmetry is to connect the states in eqs .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) , i.e. this supersymmetry connects particle and hole states .",
    "it turns out that one can find an exact solution for the case where there are only two single - particle levels @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 s are dimensionless and the sums are performed over only two single - particle states .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) can be written using the step operators : @xmath38 as @xmath39 defining the auxiliary quantities @xmath40 one obtains the energy eigenvalues as @xmath41 in the above equations , the parameters @xmath42 are to be found by solving the bethe ansatz equations @xmath43",
    "we have shown that there is an exact solution of the s - wave pairing problem with two non - degenerate orbitals in terms of the solutions of the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "( this problem is of course numerically diagonalizable in an su(2 ) @xmath44 su(2 ) basis ) .",
    "it seems to be very difficult to generalize the bethe ansatz method to the case of three non - degenerate orbitals .",
    "( of course the three single - particle level problem is diagonalizable in an su(2 ) @xmath44 su(2 ) @xmath44 su(2 ) basis ) .",
    "however , the bethe ansatz method seems to be generalizable to at least some d - wave pairing situations . in his work , mentioned earlier talmi showed that , for a hamiltonian with only one- and two - body interactions , if the doubly - magic ground state energy is normalized to zero , @xmath45 then the conditions @xmath46 = v s^{\\dagger } ( 0)\\ ] ] and @xmath47 , s^{\\dagger } ( 0 ) ] = w \\left ( s^{\\dagger } ( 0 ) \\right)^2\\ ] ] are sufficient to determine the entire energy spectra .",
    "in addition , if one considers d - wave pairing operator @xmath48 then the additional condition @xmath49 , d^{\\dagger}_m ] = w   s^{\\dagger } d^{\\dagger}_m\\ ] ] makes eigenstates with d - wave pairs possible @xmath50 note that these conditions suggest existence of an algebraic structure .",
    "in fact , ginocchio model @xcite satisfies the double commutators given above .",
    "one should explore if the bethe ansatz method can be generalized in other cases where we also have an algebraic framework .",
    "a possible answer lies in gaudin s method mentioned earlier .",
    "it can be shown that the infinite - dimensional algebra @xmath51=2\\frac{j^0(\\lambda)-j^0(\\mu)}{\\lambda-\\mu},\\ ] ] @xmath52=\\pm\\frac{j^{\\pm}(\\lambda)-j^{\\pm}(\\mu ) }                                                    { \\lambda-\\mu},\\ ] ] @xmath53=[j^{\\pm}(\\lambda),j^{\\pm}(\\mu)]=0\\ ] ] can be used to find eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath54 for details the reader is referred to , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "( it should be emphasized that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) is _ not _ the casimir operator of the infinite - dimensional algebra given above ) .",
    "the connection between the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) and the hamiltonian originally solved by richardson ( eq . [ 6 ] ) is uncovered by using the realization @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the quasi - spin operators .",
    "a possible procedure to include d - wave pairing would first identify the underlying algebraic structure ( i.e. the so(8 ) symmetry of the ginocchio model ) , then introduce the analogs of the eqs .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) through ( [ 38 ] ) using a realization analogous to that in eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "in fact a boson pairing model , using the su(1,1 ) analog of the quasi - spin in this fashion , was already studied in some detail @xcite .",
    "however , such a program with arbitrary fermion pairings remains to be largely unexplored .",
    "one should finally remark that some of the techniques discussed here are more generally applicable to other hamiltonians with special one- and two - body interactions .",
