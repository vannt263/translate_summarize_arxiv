    "a fluid drop placed on a heated surface will rapidly evaporate .",
    "the drop lifetime will decrease with increasing surface temperature until the temperature reaches the leidenfrost temperature , at which point the drop lifetime increases dramatically  @xcite . above the leidenfrost temperature a persistent vapor layer forms between the drop and the surface ; this levitates and insulates the drop . to support the drop against gravity , the pressure in the vapor layer must be above the ambient pressure .",
    "this over - pressure deforms the bottom surface of the drop into an inverted bowl , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : drop_scheme ] .",
    "the high - pressure region persists due to the resistance to vapor flow through the narrow gap between the drop and the surface , marked as the rim region in fig .",
    "[ fig : drop_scheme ] .",
    "the dynamics of the shape and the vertical profile around this rim were measured using high - speed interference - imaging .",
    "leidenfrost drops are of considerable interest from applied as well as fundamental points of view . in any application where a working fluid is used to cool a surface , either by spraying or by immersion  @xcite , once the surface reaches the leidenfrost temperature the heat - transfer , and hence the cooling , is suppressed .",
    "this can have catastrophic consequences as the liquid becomes less able to transfer heat away from the surface . because the dynamics of gap between the hot surface and the drop is dominated by the dynamics of the vapor layer , leidenfrost drops provide an accessible system to study such thin - film vapor dynamics .",
    "the average shape and gap height of an axi - symmetric leidenfrost drop are set by the combination of the surface tension , @xmath0 , acceleration due to gravity , @xmath1 , the fluid density , @xmath2 , and the pressure under the drop . there are two shape regimes determined by when the drop radius is above or below the capillary length , @xmath3 . for drops with a characteristic radius smaller than @xmath4 surface tension dominates the shape and the drop is spherical , with only a small dent in the bottom . for drops larger than @xmath4",
    ", gravity dominates and the drop flattens into a pancake of height @xmath5 and the radius set by the drop volume  @xcite .",
    "there is a maximum drop size , above which the vapor layer rises through the center of the liquid turning the drop into a torus . in both regimes , by balancing the evaporative flux into the vapor layer with the flux out due to the pressure difference , the average height of the drop above the surface has been predicted in good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the static drop can be divided into an inner and outer region separated by the rim , where the surface of the drop is parallel to the hot surface .",
    "the shape of the outer region is that of a non - wetting drop , where the shape can be predicted from the young - laplace equation  @xcite .",
    "the shape inside the rim is set by the pressure in the vapor layer and the surface tension . by matching these two solutions the full shape of drops near the maximum size",
    "can be predicted  @xcite in good agreement with measurements  @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that the height profile around the rim is not axi - symmetric  @xcite . in this paper",
    "i extended this work to study the dynamics of the rim shape and profile .",
    "i have developed image - processing techniques to automate the analysis of the high - speed interference images .",
    "these techniques are used to measure the frequency of the shape oscillations of the rim as a function of drop size .",
    "the results are in good agreement with previous predictions and measurements taken from the outer radius of the drop  @xcite .",
    "a breathing mode oscillation in the average radius of the rim is also observed .",
    "its frequency scales differently with drop size than the other modes .",
    "this breathing mode can be strongly coupled to the drop s vertical motion .",
    "the height profile around the rim evolves more slowly than the shape of the rim and than the expected period for capillary waves of comparable size .",
    "further , there is a qualitative change in the structure and dynamics of the rim as a function of drop size .",
    "large drops have ` active ' profiles , with many parts of the rim moving vertically , whereas small drops have more quiescent profiles , with a dominate ` frozen - in ' low - spatial - frequency fluctuation .",

    "i observe interference between the top of the prism and the bottom of the drop in the rim region where the drop surface and prism surface are nearly parallel ]",
    "we use high - speed interference imaging  @xcite to study the fluctuations of the gap between the bottom of the leidenfrost drop and the surface . following  @xcite",
    ", i use a glass prism , heated by an aluminum block with an embedded resistive heater , as the hot surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]a .",
    "the drop is illuminated from below with a he - ne laser  ( @xmath7 ) which is reflected up towards the drop off the hypotenuse of the prism .",
    "the laser beam comes in at an angle of approximately 10 - 15  with respect to the normal of the front face of the prism in the horizontal plane , fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]b , in order to avoid interference between the prism faces .",
    "the reflections from the top surface of the prism and the bottom surface of the drop interfere with each other and produce fringes that can be directly related to variation in the thickness of the vapor layer .",
    "observation of heavily dyed drops verified that the reflection from the bottom surface dominates the interference pattern .",
    "these interference fringes are directed onto a high - speed camera and imaged at a rate between 1,000 and 10,000 frames per second for 3 to 30 seconds .",
    "in addition to thermally insulating the drop , the vapor layer essentially eliminates friction between the drop and the surface .",
    "thus any infinitesimal tilt in the prism results in motion of the drop .",
    "i took data either by filming the drop as it transited the field of view or by pinning the drop either by letting it rest against a wall by gravity or by a piece of wire from above .",
    "while these methods have different boundary conditions , the drops are qualitatively the same in all cases .",
    "there are two natural radii in a leidenfrost drop : the radius as viewed from the top , @xmath8 , marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : drop_scheme ] , and the distance from the center of the drop to the rim , @xmath6 , also marked in fig .",

    "most previous work viewed the drop from above where @xmath8 can easily be measured , but in that configuration the rim on the bottom surface is not visible . using interference imaging @xmath6 can be measured . as discussed above ,",
    "the outer profile of a static leidenfrost drop is the profile of a sessile drop with a contact angle of 180 .",
    "the numerical relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath8 has been established from computed drop profiles  @xcite .",
    "this relationship is used to convert the measurements of @xmath6 to @xmath8 in order to compare with previous experiments and theory .",

    "the light reflected off the glass - air interface , @xmath10 , interferes with the light reflected off of the air - water interface , @xmath11 .",
    "the additional phase in @xmath12 is from the reflection at the air - water interface ( @xmath13 ) and the phase accumulated from the additional distance the light travels in traversing the air gap twice : ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "each pixel is divided by the average for that pixel across all of the frames of a given movie .",

    "[ fig : raw_unmarked]a . the largest , clearest fringes in the image correspond to the rim region marked in fig .  [",
    "fig : drop_scheme ] , where the bottom of the drop is most nearly parallel to the top of the prism .",
    "as the surface becomes steeper , both inside and outside of the rim , the fringes become more tightly spaced .",
    "this results in moir patterns due to interference between the fringe pattern and the pixels of the camera when their spatial frequencies become comparable . because the drop surface must be continuous , eq .",
    "( [ eq : interference ] ) implies that contiguous regions of equal intensity are surfaces of constant @xmath9 .",
    "further , adjacent pairs of light and dark fringes , where the intensity has moved from a local maximum to a local minimum , have a height difference of @xmath20 .    in general , interference only gives the absolute value of the height difference between adjacent fringes , not the sign of the difference .",
    "however in this case the curvature in the radial direction is always upward , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : drop_scheme ] .",
    "thus the peak features , where the gaussian curvature is positive , are where the rim is closest to the surface and the saddle features , where the gaussian curvature is negative , are where the rim is farthest from the surface .",
    "further , because the surface of the drop is continuous , all of the steps between a saddle and a peak are in the same direction .",
    "thus , by starting on any fringe and counting fringes around the rim one can build up the profile of the rim , as was done by hand in  @xcite . here a method is presented to automate this process .    an example profile extracted by my software",

    "the fringe locations are first used to reconstruct the rim shape at a given time and then used to reconstruct the height profile ( [ subsec : hr ] ) as a function of time .",
    "the code used for this analysis is available under the gpl at https://github.com/tacaswell/leidenfrost .      to locate the fringes , the algorithm needs to be provided with a seed - curve which approximately traces the rim in the image . for the first frame this is supplied by hand , but for all subsequent frames the result from the previous frame is used .",

    "a possible explanation for this observation is that the drop is able to lower it s center of mass by introducing an asymmetry in the rim height profile .",
    "the flux through a very narrow gap goes as the cube of the gap height , @xmath107 , thus if two sections of the rim are raised and lowered by the same small amount , to not change the center of mass of the drop , there will be a net increase in the flux out from the high - pressure region . to maintain the balance between flux into and out of the vapor region the drop",
    "will reduce the height of it s center of mass , which will both increase the evaporative flux in and decrease the flux out , and lower the potential energy of the whole system .",
    "thus the axisymmetric case is unstable to small perturbations in the rim height profile and the drop will always be have some height variation around the rim .",
    "this instability is presumably cut off by the details of the vapor flow and surface tension which prevent any part of the drop from getting too close to the surface and prevent large curvatures from developing along the rim .",
    "this paper has extended the high - speed laser - interference technique to study the bottom surface of a leidenfrost drop . by automating the image analysis to locate , classify , and interpret the interference fringes it has been possible to extract the location , shape , and height profile of the rim in each frame of a high - speed movie . from this , the frequencies of oscillation for the shape of the rim were obtained . moreover , this capability has allowed the observation of a number of previously unreported dynamics such as a breathing mode in the size of the rim which is coupled to , and @xmath81 out of phase with , the vertical motion of the drop .",
    "the rim , where the drop is closest to the surface , is never a uniform height above the substrate but is unstable against small perturbations so that there will always be a variation in the gap height around the rim .",
    "the absolute magniture of the height fluctuation does not appear to depend on drop size .",
    "this points to an underlying instability driven by the increased ability of gas to escape the pocket when the rim is non - uniform .",
    "whereas the in - plane shape deformations are associated with capillary waves , the variations in the gap height are not .",
    "the timescale on which the gap heights fluctuate is an order of magnitude slower than capillary waves of comparable wavelength and there is no evidence of persistent standing or traveling waves around the rim .",
    "the dynamics of the gap height are controlled by a combination of the dynamics of the thin - film vapor flow of the escaping gas and the dynamics associated with the overall drop shape .",
    "large drops are ` active ' with multiple pairs of local extrema that evolve in both location and size as a function of time ; small drops have a single dominant pair of extrema that are relatively fixed in position and size .",
    "the onset of the quiescent small - drop regime is surprizingly sudden .",
    "this clearly shows that the leidenfrost vapor layer has complex and rich dynamics that warrants further investigation .",

    "i am also grateful to justin burton who s experimental apparatus i adapted for this work .",
