    "the rice compression algorithm ( rice _ et  al .",
    "_ 1993 ) is particularly familiar to astronomers in combination with the fits tiled image convention ( white _ et  al .",
    "_ 2006 , seaman _",
    "it has been informally paired in the past with non - linear data representations ( nieto - santisteban _",
    "_ 1999 , nicula _",
    "mention of compression is often followed immediately by the word `` scheme '' , as if this branch of computer science were suitable only for black - box heuristics arrived at through a process of trial - and - error .",
    "this paper seeks to begin a process of layering the issue of optimal data encoding onto a more formal foundation .    as discussed in pence , seaman & white ( 2009a , b ) , the compression achieved for an astronomical image is typically determined almost entirely by its background noise . any processing that quiets",
    "the background will increase the compression ratio .",
    "this is the foundation for all lossy compression algorithms  in effect , lossy compression combines a preprocessing step that tempers an image s noise characteristics with the subsequent application of a lossless algorithm .",
    "janesick ( 2001 ) describes a non - linear hardware or software component called a `` square - rooter '' .",
    "instead of using a linear analog - to - digital conversion when reading out a ccd , the square - root of these values acts to linearize the poisson statistics that characterizes these detectors .",
    "such a dn encoding has been used on several space missions to reduce bandwidth requirements for data transport . while technically lossy",
    "if the square - root transform occurs after the a / d conversion , it is equally reasonable to consider this a type of lossless encoding since the transform maintains oversampling of the noise at both the high and low end of the dynamic range .",
    "square - root encoding itself acts as a form of compression ",
    "65,636 linear data levels ( for 16-bit pixels ) will turn into a scant 256 levels after the square - root .",
    "this is not nearly as dramatic when expressed in bits , since mapping 16 bits into 8 bits corresponds to a compression ratio of just @xmath0 .",
    "the more important aspect , rather , is to linearize the noise .",
    "a vector of random variables ( _ ie . _ , an image )",
    "is said to be _",
    "heteroscedastic _ if the variance depends on the signal .",
    "many astronomical detectors are governed by photon shot - noise , described by poisson statistics with the noise varying as the square - root of the signal .",
    "bright pixels are noisy pixels .",
    "many familiar statistical techniques such as least - squares fitting formally require _",
    "homoscedasticity_. the penalty for ignoring this requirement for a particular purpose may range from negligible to significant , but",
    "the broader point is that astronomical noise models are often very non - linear .",
    "data compression techniques as applied to astronomical data must take this into account .",
    "techniques exist to stabilize the variance , that is , to convert a heteroscedastic data set to one that is homoscedastic .",
    "one such technique is the anscombe transform ( anscombe 1948 ) : @xmath1 the anscombe transform will convert a poisson sample to have ( nearly ) gaussian statistics .",
    "the factor of 2 ensures a unit variance . real astronomical data does not follow a pure poisson noise model .",
    "for instance , each pixel on a ccd has additive gaussian read - noise as well as poisson shot - noise .",
    "the generalized anscombe transform ( murtagh _ et  al .",
    "_ 1995 ) will stabilize the variance in this case : @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "this can be rearranged into a form that uses familiar ccd terminology ( with care to keep units straight between dn and @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 here the quantities have their usual meaning :    * @xmath6 is a pixel value in analog - to - digital data numbers ( dn ) * the ccd @xmath7 is in dn * the ccd @xmath8 is in @xmath9 * the readout noise , @xmath10 , is in electrons , @xmath4",
    "in this form , variance stabilization becomes very reminiscent of the ccd photon transfer technique ( janesick 2007 ) .",
    "( many of this paper s conclusions will be applicable to other types of astronomical detectors , particularly in the optical and infrared .",
    ") gain is the slope of a ccd s mean - variance relation , but photon transfer permits much finer grained analysis than simply assuming a scalar gain .",
    "bright pixels greatly oversample the noise .",
    "all digital devices must contend with quantization noise as a term like @xmath11 dn ( widrow & kollr 2008 ) . to avoid stairstep aliasing effects",
    ", the gain of a ccd should be kept lower than the read - noise , typically a value of a few . on the other hand",
    ", the high end of the dynamic range is governed by shot noise , scaling as the square - root of the signal ( in @xmath4 ) . for a gain fixed at unity , the noise for pixels near the top of the 16-bit range will be 256 dn , fully 2 orders of magnitude above the read - noise .",
    "noise adds in quadrature  permitting the gain to be scaled with total noise : @xmath12 this is simply another way to look at variance stabilization ( see , for example , figure 11.19 from janesick 2007 ) .",
    "the goal is to tame all the sources of noise .",
    "astronomical images are not simply random agglomerations of pixels , they result from astronomical detectors with specific characteristics and noise models . for ccds ( quantum yield @xmath13 )",
    "this becomes : @xmath14 this presents a quandry , since the fixed pattern noise ( fpn ) dominates both the gaussian read - noise and poisson shot noise at the bright end ( if not flatfielded ) .",
    "the question is how to put this together into a coherent recipe .",
    "work is ongoing , but broad strokes are clear .",
    "first , the quandry is only apparent , since to first order the signal ( and thus the fpn ) is negligible . recall that the compression ratio , _ r _ , is determined by the noise in the _ background _",
    "( pence _ et  al .",
    "_ 2009a , b ) : @xmath15 where ( @xmath16 estimated per stoehr 2007 ) : @xmath17    second , phenomenological schemes such as eq . 7.86 from janesick ( 2001 ) : @xmath18 are simplified versions of the more formal functional behavior . equation ( 8) is the same as the anscombe transform when @xmath19 ( _ eg . _ , @xmath20 for _ bitpix _ = 16 ) and when the 3/8 term is negligible ( @xmath21 ) .    whatever functional form , a lookup table is an efficient implementation .",
    "the mapping @xmath22 is surjective ; several inputs map to one output .",
    "the inverse lut is compact as a header or table structure under the fits tiled image convention .",
    "libraries like cfitsio ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio ) that support tiling will be able to use such luts to transparently recover the linear data with adequate noise sampling . for some purposes linearization is not needed .",
    "square root encoding may be just what is wanted to load an image display , or for homoscedastic statistics ( _ eg .",
    "_ , principle components analysis ) , or for multiresolution techniques using wavelets ( murtagh _ et  al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .      1 .",
    "since it is the background noise that matters , the low end mapping is key .",
    "however , in equation ( 3 ) each pixel value is corrected for the bias , potentially driving the radicand negative .",
    "how can this best be resolved ? 2 .",
    "what is the best high end mapping for raw and flat - fielded images ? 3 .",
    "when bringing the ccd noise model into alignment with the generalized anscombe transform , it is easy to get lost between @xmath4 and dns ( also , what most call the _ gain _ , janesick calls _ sensitivity _ , the inverse gain ) .",
    "effects like quantum yield need to be folded into the variance stabilization .",
    "4 .   the data compression literature ( _ eg .",
    "_ , salomon 2004 ) is built on a foundation of information theory ( _ eg .",
    "_ , cover & thomas 2006 ) . as such , it may be revealing to recast both the variance stabilization and ccd noise modeling techniques in terms of the shannon entropy ( 1948 ) .",
