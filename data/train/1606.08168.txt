    "last year s physics nobel prize was awarded for the discovery of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this discovery taught us two things : ( 1 ) lepton flavor is violated .",
    "thus transitions of charged leptons such as @xmath0 should naturally occur .",
    "( 2 ) surprisingly the masses of neutrinos are orders of magnitude smaller than those of quarks and charged leptons .",
    "on the one hand mysteriously small neutrino masses suppress the charged lepton transitions so much that these transitions are essentially forbidden in the standard model . on the other hand",
    "they seem to hint that neutrinos are majorana and that their right - handed partners may exist in the mass range of @xmath4@xmath5  gev , as required by the see - saw mechanism .",
    "then , through the evolution of the renormalization group equation ( rge ) from such ultra - high energy down to our world , the rates of the charged lepton transitions grow to an observable level , e.g. @xmath6 , even if lepton flavor is conserved at the ultra - high energy  @xcite .",
    "the ultra - high mass scale suggested by the see - saw mechanism may be indicative of their connection to susy gut that unify the strong and electroweak forces at @xmath7  gev .",
    "it was also shown that gut themselves make the charged lepton transitions grow to a similar level , @xmath6 , through the rge evolution  @xcite .    over the last five years we have seen two epoch - making developments in particle physics : discoveries of higgs and the third neutrino oscillation , @xmath8 .",
    "the fact that the higgs boson is rather light ( @xmath9  gev ) suggests that the higgs is likely to be elementary and our theory may be safely extrapolated up to ultra - high energy where see - saw mechanism and/or gut may be realized . and the observed large mixing angle @xmath10 means that even higher @xmath11 is expected in many physics scenarios .    in addition , if some tev - scale new physics causes the tantalizing deviation of the anomalous magnetic moment of muons , @xmath12 , from the standard model by more than 3@xmath13  @xcite , it should also cause @xmath0 decays at an experimentally measurable branching ratio with a reasonable assumption of flavor violation  @xcite .",
    "although tev - scale new physics has been explored so much by the lhc experiments , components of new physics that are not strongly interacting are not much constrained yet .",
    "searches for charged lepton transitions like @xmath0 are more sensitive to those components and are thus complementary and synergetic to the lhc experiments in exploring tev - scale new physics .",
    "a @xmath14 decay is characterized by an electron and a photon emitted back - to - back with energy equal to half the muon mass ( 52.8  mev ) in the rest frame of the muon .",
    "positive muons are used to avoid formation of muonic atoms in the muon stopping target . to explore the tiny branching ratio of the range @xmath15 , an enormous number of stopped muons ( @xmath16/sec ) must be prepared by a high - power accelerator . in such high rate environment the leading source of",

    "a non - negligible approximately paraboloidal deformation of the stopping target ( a 205  @xmath32 m thick layer of polyethylene and polyester ) was found for the 2012 - 2013 runs with a maximum systematic uncertainty of 0.3 - 0.5  mm along the beam axis .",
    "this represents a single dominant systematic error that degraded the sensitivity by 13% on average while the total contribution of all the other systematic uncertainties is less than 1% .",

    "in 2013 our proposal for upgrading the meg detectors to improve the experimental sensitivity by an order of magnitude  @xcite was approved by the psi research committee .",
    "the basic idea is to achieve the highest possible sensitivity by making maximum use of the available muon intensity at psi with improved detectors , since we had to reduce the intensity for a stable operation of the detector and to keep background at a manageable level in the meg experiment .",
    "other main improvements of meg  ii include : ( 1 ) larger detector acceptance by more than a factor 2 by diminishing materials between the new single - volume drift chamber and the timing counter ; ( 2 ) improved resolutions for photons with more uniform collection of scintillation light by replacing the phototubes with new vuv - sensitive @xmath46  mm@xmath47 sipms , ( 3 ) improved resolutions for @xmath21 with arrays of thin scintillator tiles to achieve 30  ps resolution with @xmath48 hit tiles per @xmath21 and better position resolution and more hits per track of the new drift chamber with small stereo cells ; and ( 4 ) further background suppression with a pair of counters to actively tag rmd photons by detecting the associated low momentum @xmath21 s . a thinner but more solid target ( @xmath49 m thick ) with a beam - monitoring capability is also being studied to control target - related systematic uncertainties .",
    "upgraded detectors are currently being constructed .",
    "a quarter of the timing counter was installed and tested under the actual meg  ii beam condition using newly developed trigger and daq electronics system .",
    "a full engineering run is scheduled in 2017 and may evolve into physics run if things get ready .",
    "a few months of data taking will be sufficient to exceed the meg sensitivity . to reach the final sensitivity goal of @xmath3 will require 3 years of data taking .",
