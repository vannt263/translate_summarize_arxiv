    "specifically , we define two @xmath5-actions on the space of flat connections , one corresponding to the left half of the cylinder and one corresponding to the right , both of which cover the goldman flow on the moduli space .",
    "the key step in defining these two @xmath5-actions is to use lemma 2.3 from @xcite , which says that a flat connection on the surface can be _ adapted _ to the cylinder .",
