    "the basic principle of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite states that every consistent m - theory or type ii background with metric @xmath11 in d - dimensions , where @xmath12 is an einstein manifold , is associated with a conformal quantum field theory living on the boundary of @xmath13 .",
    "the background is typically generated by the near horizon geometry of a set of p - branes and the boundary conformal field theory is identified with the ir limit of the gauge theory living on the world - volume of the p - branes .",
    "one remarkable example with @xmath14 supersymmetry on the boundary and with a non - trivial smooth manifold @xmath15 was found in @xcite and the associated superconformal theory was identified . some general properties and the complete spectrum of the @xmath16 compactification",
    "have been discussed in @xcite , finding complete agreement between gauge theory expectations and supergravity predictions . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath17 when @xmath18 is a coset manifold @xmath19 with @xmath20 supersymmetry .",
    "backgrounds of the form @xmath21 arise as the near horizon geometry of a collection of m2-branes in m - theory .",
    "the @xmath22 supersymmetric case corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "examples of superconformal theories with less supersymmetry can be obtained by orbifolding the m2-brane solution @xcite .",
    "orbifold models have the advantage that the gauge theory can be directly obtained as a quotient of the @xmath22 theory using standard techniques @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the internal manifold @xmath2 is @xmath24 divided by some discrete group and it is generically singular .",
    "smooth manifolds @xmath2 can be obtained by considering m2-branes sitting at the singular point of the cone over @xmath2 , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "many examples where @xmath2 is a coset manifold @xmath19 were studied in the old days of kk theories @xcite ( see @xcite for the cases @xmath24 and squashed @xmath24 , see @xcite for the case @xmath26 , see @xcite for the case @xmath27 , see @xcite for general methods of harmonic analysis in compactification and the structure of @xmath28 supermultiplets , and finally see @xcite for a complete classification of @xmath19 compactifications . )    for obvious reason , @xmath9 was much more investigated in those days than his simpler cousin @xmath29 . as a consequence ,",
    "we have a plethora of @xmath30 compactifications for which the dual superconformal theory is still to be found .",
    "if we require supersymmetric solutions , which are guaranteed to be stable and are simpler to study , and furthermore we require @xmath31 , we find four examples : @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "these are the natural @xmath9 counterparts of the @xmath16 conifold theory studied in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall consider in some detail the two cases @xmath27 and @xmath35 .",
    "they have isometry @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the isometry of these manifolds corresponds to the global symmetry of the dual superconformal theories , including the @xmath38 r - symmetry of @xmath20 supersymmetry .",
    "the complete spectrum of 11-dimensional supergravity compactified on @xmath35 has been recently computed @xcite . the analogous spectrum for @xmath27",
    "has not been computed yet , but several partial results exist in the literature @xcite , which will be enough for our purpose .",
    "the kk spectrum should match the spectrum of the gauge theory operators of finite dimension in the large @xmath39 limit . as a difference with the maximally supersymmetric case , the kk spectrum contains both _ short _ and _ long _ operators ; this is a characteristic feature of @xmath0 supersymmetry and was already found in @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we will show that the spectra on @xmath27 and @xmath35 share several common features with their cousin @xmath16 .",
    "first of all , the kk spectrum is in perfect agreement with the spectrum of operators of a superconformal theory with a set of fundamental _ supersingleton fields _ inherited from the geometry of the manifold . in the abelian case",
    "this is by no means a surprise because of the well known relations among harmonic analysis , representation theory and holomorphic line bundles over algebraic homogeneous spaces .",
    "the non - abelian case is more involved .",
    "there is no straightforward method to identify the gauge theory living on m2-branes placed at the singularity of @xmath25 when the space is not an orbifold .",
    "hence we shall use intuition from toric geometry to write candidate gauge theories that have the right global symmetries and a spectrum of short operators which matches the kk spectrum .",
    "some points that still need to be clarified are pointed out .",
    "a second remarkable property of these spaces is the existence of non - trivial cycles and non - perturbative states , obtained by wrapping branes , which are identified with baryons in the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the corresponding baryonic @xmath38 symmetry is associated with the so - called betti multiplets @xcite .",
    "the conformal dimension of a baryon can be computed in supergravity , following @xcite , and unambiguously predicts the dimension of the fundamental conformal fields of the theory in the ir .",
    "the result from the baryon analysis is remarkably in agreement with the expectations from the kk spectrum .",
    "this can be considered as a highly non - trivial check of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "moreover we will also notice that , as it happens on @xmath16 @xcite , there exists a class of long multiplets which , against expectations , have a protected dimension which is rational and agrees with a naive computation .",
    "there seems to be a common pattern for the appearance of these operators in all the various models .",
    "our purpose is to study a collection of m2-branes sitting at the singular point of the conifold @xmath25 , where @xmath3 or @xmath4 . while for branes sitting at orbifold singularities there is a straightforward method for identifying the gauge theory living on the world - volume @xcite , for conifold singularities much less",
    "is known @xcite .",
    "the strategy of describing the conifold as a deformation of an orbifold singularity used in @xcite and identifying the superconformal theory as the ir limit of the deformed orbifold theory , seems more difficult to be applied in three dimensions . was attempted without , however , providing a match with kaluza klein spectra .",
    "another partial attempt in this direction was also given in @xcite .",
    "] we will then use the intuition from geometry in order to identify the fundamental degrees of freedom of the superconformal theory and to compare them with the results of the kk expansion .",
    "we expect to find the superconformal fixed points dual to @xmath41-compactifications as the ir limits of three - dimensional gauge theories . in the maximally supersymmetric case",
    "@xmath42 , for example , the superconformal theory is the ir limit of the @xmath22 supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite . in three dimensions , the gauge coupling constant is dimensionful and",
    "a gauge theory is certainly not conformal .",
    "however , the theory becomes conformal in the ir , where the coupling constant blows up . in this simple case , the identification of the superconformal theory living on the world - volume of the m2-branes follows from considering m - theory on a circle .",
    "the m2-branes become d2-branes in type iia , whose world - volume supports the @xmath22 gauge theory with a dimensionful coupling constant related to the radius of the circle .",
    "the near horizon geometry of d2-branes is not anymore ads @xcite , since the theory is not conformal .",
    "the ads background and conformal invariance is recovered by sending the radius to infinity ; this corresponds to sending the gauge theory coupling to infinity and probing the ir of the gauge theory .",
    "we expect a similar behaviour for other three dimensional gauge theories . as a difference with four  dimensional cft s corresponding to @xmath29 backgrounds , which always have exact marginal directions labeled by the coupling constants ( the type iib dilaton is a free parameter of the supergravity solution ) ,",
    "these three dimensional fixed points may also be isolated .",
    "the only universal parameter in m - theory compactifications is @xmath43 , which is related to the number of colors @xmath39 , that is also the number of m2-branes . the @xmath44 expansion in the gauge theory corresponds to the @xmath45 expansion of m - theory through the relation @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "for large @xmath39 , the m - theory solution is weakly coupled and supergravity can be used for studying the gauge theory .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom at the superconformal fixed points are in general different from the elementary fields of the supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "for example , vector multiplets are not conformal in three dimensions and they should be replaced by some other multiplets of the superconformal group by dualizing the vector field to a scalar .",
    "let us again consider the simple example of @xmath22 .",
    "the degrees of freedom at the superconformal point ( the singletons , in the language of representation theory of the superconformal group ) are contained in a supermultiplet with eight real scalars and eight fermions , transforming in representations of the global r - symmetry @xmath47 . this is the same content of the @xmath22 vector multiplet , when the vector field is dualized into a scalar .",
    "the change of variable from a vector to a scalar , which is well - defined in an abelian theory , is obviously a non - trivial and not even well - defined operation in a non - abelian theory .",
    "the scalars in the supersingleton parametrize the flat space transverse to the m2-branes . in this case , the moduli space of vacua of the abelian @xmath22 gauge theory , corresponding to a single m2-brane , is isomorphic to the transverse space .",
    "the case with @xmath39 m2-branes is obtained by promoting the theory to a non - abelian one .",
    "we want to follow a similar procedure for the conifold cases .    for branes at the conifold singularity of @xmath25",
    "there is no obvious way of reducing the system to a simple configuration of d2-branes in type iia and read the field content by using standard brane techniques . and in @xcite for @xmath0 .",
    "] we can nevertheless use the intuition from geometry for identifying the relevant degrees of freedom at the superconformal point .",
    "we need an abelian gauge theory whose moduli space of vacua is isomorphic to @xmath25 .",
    "the moduli space of vacua of @xmath0 theories have two different branches touching at a point , the coulomb branch parametrized by the _ vev _ of the scalars in the vector multiplet and the higgs branch parametrized by the _ vev _ of the scalars in the chiral multiplets .",
    "the higgs branch is the one we are interested in .",
    "each of the two branches excludes the other , so we can consistently set the scalars in the vector multiplets to zero ( see appendix [ scalapot ] for a discussion of the scalar potential in general @xmath0 , @xmath48 theories ) .",
    "we can find what we need in toric geometry . indeed , this latter describes certain complex manifolds as khler quotients associated to symplectic actions of a product of @xmath38 s on some @xmath49 .",
    "this is completely equivalent to imposing the d - term equations for an abelian @xmath50 gauge theory and dividing by the gauge group or , in other words , to finding the moduli space of vacua of the theory .",
    "fortunately , both the cone over @xmath27 and that over @xmath35 have a toric geometry description . this description was already used for studying these spaces in @xcite . in this paper , we will consider a different point of view .",
    "we can then easily find abelian gauge theories whose moduli space of vacua ( the higgs branch component ) is isomorphic to these two particular conifolds . in the following subsections ,",
    "we briefly discuss the geometry of the two manifolds and the abelian gauge theory associated with the toric description .",
    "more complete information about the geometry and the homology of the manifolds are contained in part [ geometry ] . here",
    "we briefly recall the basic information needed to discuss the matching of the kk spectrum with the expectations from the conformal theory .",
    "@xmath27 , originally introduced as a @xmath51 compactifying solution with @xmath0 susy in @xcite , is a specific instance in the family of the @xmath52 manifolds , that are all of the form : @xmath53 the cone over @xmath27 is a toric manifold obtained as the khler quotient of @xmath54 by the symplectic action of two @xmath38 s .",
    "explicitly , it is described as the solution of the following two d ",
    "term equations ( momentum map equations in mathematical language ) @xmath55 modded by the action of the corresponding two @xmath38 s , the first acting only on @xmath56 with charge @xmath57 and on @xmath58 with charge @xmath59 , the second acting only on @xmath58 with charge @xmath57 and on @xmath60 with charge @xmath59 .",
    "the manifold @xmath27 can be obtained by setting each term in  ( [ toricq ] ) equal to 1 , i.e. as @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to taking a section of the cone at a fixed value of the radial coordinate ( an horizon in morrison and plesser s language @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in full generality , this radial coordinate is identified with the fourth coordinate of @xmath9 , while the section is identified with the internal manifold @xcite the radial coordinate is algebraically characterized as being associated with the cartan semisimple generator , while the remaining three are associated with the three nilpotent generators spanning the brane world volume .",
    "so we have a natural splitting of @xmath9 into @xmath62 which mirrors the natural splitting of the eight dimensional conifold into @xmath63 .",
    "the radial coordinate is shared by the two spaces .",
    "this phenomenon , that is the algebraic basis for the existence of smooth m2 brane solutions with horizon geometry @xmath64 , was named dimensional transmigration in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "given the toric description , the identification of an abelian @xmath0 gauge theory whose higgs branch reproduces the conifold is straightforward .",
    "equations  ( [ toricq ] ) are the d - terms for the abelian theory @xmath65 with doublets of chiral fields @xmath56 with charges @xmath66 , @xmath58 with charge @xmath67 and @xmath60 with charges @xmath68 and without superpotential .",
    "the theory has an obvious global symmetry @xmath69 matching the isometry of @xmath27 .",
    "we introduced three @xmath38 factors ( one more than those appearing in the toric data , as the attentive reader certainly noticed ) for symmetry reasons .",
    "one of the three @xmath38 s is decoupled and has no role in our discussion .",
    "since we do not expect a decoupled @xmath38 in the world - volume theory of m2-branes living at the conifold singularity , we should better consider the theory @xmath70 .",
    "the fields appearing in the toric description should represent the fundamental degrees of freedom of the superconformal theory , since they appear as chiral fields in the gauge theory .",
    "they have definite transformation properties under the gauge group . out of them",
    "we can also build some gauge invariant combinations , which should represent the composite operators of the conformal theory and which should be matched with the kk spectrum .",
    "geometrically , this corresponds to describing the cone as an affine subvariety of some @xmath6 .",
    "this is a standard procedure , which converts the definition of a toric manifold in terms of d - terms to an equivalent one in terms of binomial equations in @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", we have an embedding in @xmath71 .",
    "we first construct all the @xmath38 invariants ( in this case there are @xmath72 of them ) @xmath73 they satisfy a set of binomial equations which cut out the image of our conifold @xmath74 in @xmath71 .",
    "these equations are actually the @xmath75 quadrics explicitely written in eq.s ( [ sigxx ] ) of part [ geometry ] .",
    "indeed , there is a general method to obtain the embedding equations of the cones over algebraic homogeneous varieties based on representation theory .",
    "equations were already mentioned in @xcite although their representation theory interpretation was not given there . ]",
    "if we want to summarize this general method in few words , we can say the following . through eq .",
    "( [ embedding ] ) we see that the coordinates @xmath76 of @xmath71 are assigned to a certain representation @xmath77 of the isometry group @xmath69 .",
    "in our case such a representation is @xmath78 .",
    "the products @xmath79 belong to the symmetric product @xmath80 , which in general branches into various representations , one of highest weight plus several subleading ones . on the cone , however , only the highest weight representation survives while all the subleading ones vanish . imposing that such subleading representations are zero corresponds to writing the embedding equations .",
    "this has far reaching consequences in the conformal field theory , since provides the definition of the chiral ring . in principle",
    "all the representations appearing in the @xmath81-th symmetric tensor power of @xmath82 could correspond to primary conformal operators . yet",
    "the attention should be restricted to those that do not vanish modulo the equations of the cone , namely modulo the ideal generated by the representations of subleading weights .",
    "in other words , only the highest weight representation contained in the @xmath83 gives a true chiral operator .",
    "this is what matches the kaluza klein spectra found through harmonic analysis .",
    "two points should be stressed .",
    "in general the number of embedding equations is larger than the codimension of the algebraic locus .",
    "for instance @xmath84 , i.e. the cone is not a complete intersection .",
    "the @xmath75 equations ( [ sigxx ] ) define the ideal @xmath85 of @xmath86:={\\mathbb c}[x^{111},\\ldots , x^{222}]$ ] cutting the cone @xmath74 .",
    "the second point to stress is the double interpretation of the embedding equations .",
    "the fact that @xmath27 leads to @xmath0 supersymmetry means that it is sasakian , i.e. it is a circle bundle over a suitable complex three  fold . if considered in @xmath71 the ideal @xmath85 cuts out the conifold @xmath74 .",
    "being homogeneous , it can also be regarded as cutting out an algebraic variety in @xmath87 .",
    "this is @xmath88 , namely the base of the @xmath38 fibre - bundle @xmath27 .",
    "it follows from this discussion that the invariant operators @xmath76 of eq .",
    "( [ embedding ] ) can be naturally associated with the building blocks of the gauge invariant composite operators of our cft .",
    "holomorphic combinations of the @xmath76 should span the set of chiral operators of the theory .",
    "as we stated above , the set of embedding equations ( [ sigxx ] ) imposes restrictions on the allowed representations of @xmath69 and hence on the existing operators .",
    "if we put the definition of @xmath76 in terms of the fundamental fields @xmath89 into the equations ( [ sigxx ] ) , we see that they are automatically satisfied when the theory is abelian .",
    "since we want eventually to promote @xmath89 to non - abelian fields , these equations become non - trivial because the fields do not commute anymore .",
    "they essentially assert that the chiral operators we may construct out of the @xmath76 are totally symmetric in the exchange of the various @xmath89 , that is they belong to the highest weight representations we mentioned above .",
    "it is clear that the two different geometric descriptions of the conifold , the first in terms of the variables @xmath89 and the second in terms of the @xmath90 , correspond to the two possible parametrization of the moduli space of vacua of an @xmath0 theory , one in terms of _ vevs _ of the fundamental fields and the second in terms of gauge invariant chiral operators .",
    "we notice that this discussion closely parallels the analogous one in @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 is indeed a close relative of @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath35 is a specific instance in the family of the @xmath26 manifolds , that are all of the form ( see @xcite ) : @xmath91 the details of the embedding are given in section [ mp29 ] .",
    "the cone over @xmath35 is a toric manifold obtained as a khler quotient of @xmath92 , described as the solution of the d - term equation @xmath93 modded by the action of a @xmath38 , acting on @xmath94 with charge @xmath95 and on @xmath96 with charge @xmath97 .",
    "the manifold @xmath35 can be obtained by setting both terms of equation  ( [ toricm ] ) equal to 1 .",
    "given the toric description , we can identify the corresponding abelian @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "equation  ( [ toricm ] ) is the d - term for the abelian theory @xmath98 with a triplet of chiral fields @xmath94 with charges",
    "@xmath99 , a doublet @xmath96 with charge @xmath100 and without superpotential .",
    "the theory has an obvious global symmetry @xmath37 matching the isometry of @xmath35 .",
    "again , we introduced two @xmath38 factors for symmetry reasons .",
    "one of them is decoupled and we should better consider the theory @xmath101 .    the fields @xmath102 should represent the fundamental degrees of freedom of the superconformal theory , since they appear as chiral fields in the gauge theory . as before , we can find a second representation of our manifold in terms of an embedding in some @xmath6 with coordinates representing the chiral composite operators of our cft .",
    "in this case , we have an embedding in @xmath103 .",
    "we again construct all the @xmath38 invariants ( in this case there are 30 of them ) and we find that they are assigned to the @xmath104 of @xmath105 .",
    "the embedding equations of the conifold into @xmath103 correspond to the statement that in the clebsch  gordon expansion of the symmetric product @xmath106 all representations different from the highest weight one should vanish .",
    "this yields @xmath107 equations grouped into @xmath5 irreducible representations ( see section [ mp29 ] for details ) .",
    "as in the @xmath27 case , the @xmath108 can be associated with the building blocks of the gauge invariant composite operators of our cft and the ideal generated by the embedding equations ( [ embeddi ] ) ( see section [ mp29 ] ) imposes many restrictions on the existing conformal operators .",
    "actually , as we try to make clear in the explicit comparison with kaluza klein data ( see section [ comparo ] ) , the entire spectrum is fully determined by the structure of the ideal above .",
    "indeed , as it should be clear from the previous group theoretical description of the embedding equations , the result of the constraints is to select chiral operators which are totally symmetrized in the @xmath109 and @xmath110 indices .",
    "in the previous section , we explicitly constructed an abelian theory whose moduli space of vacua reproduces the cone over the two manifolds @xmath27 and @xmath35 .",
    "these can be easily promoted to non - abelian ones .",
    "once this is done , we can compare the expected spectrum of short operators in the cft with the kk spectrum . in this section",
    "we compare only the chiral operators .",
    "the comparison of the full spectrum , which is known only for @xmath35 , will be done in part [ comparo ] .",
    "the theory for @xmath27 becomes @xmath111 with three series of chiral fields in the following representations of the gauge group @xmath112 the field content can be conveniently encoded in a quiver diagram , where nodes represent the gauge groups and links matter fields in the bi - fundamental representation of the groups they are connecting . the quiver diagram for @xmath27",
    "is pictured in figure [ abccolor ] .",
    "= 8 cm 0.2 cm = 1.1 mm    the global symmetry of the gauge theory is @xmath69 , where each of the doublets of chiral fields transforms in the fundamental representation of one of the @xmath110 s .",
    "notice that we are considering @xmath113 gauge group and not the naively expected @xmath114 .",
    "the reason is that there is compelling evidence @xcite that the @xmath38 factors are washed out in the near horizon limit .",
    "since in three dimensions @xmath38 theories may give rise to cft s in the ir , it is an important point to check whether @xmath38 factors are described by the @xmath41-solution or not . a first piece of evidence that the supergravity solutions are dual to @xmath113 theories , and not @xmath114 , comes from the absence in the kk spectrum ( even in the maximal supersymmetric case ) of kk modes corresponding to color trace of single fundamental fields of the cft , which are non zero only for @xmath114 gauge groups .",
    "a second evidence is the existence of states dual to baryonic operators in the non - perturbative spectrum of these type ii or m - theory compactifications ; baryons exist only for @xmath113 groups .",
    "we will find baryons in the spectrum of both @xmath27 and @xmath35 : this implies that , for the compactifications discussed in this paper , the gauge group of the cft is @xmath113 .    in the non - abelian case",
    ", we expect that the generic point of the moduli space corresponds to n separated branes .",
    "therefore , the space of vacua of the theory should reduce to the symmetrization of n copies of @xmath27 . to get rid of unwanted light non - abelian degrees of freedom , we would like to introduce , following @xcite , a superpotential for our theory .",
    "unfortunately , the obvious candidate for this job @xmath115 is identically zero . here",
    "the close analogy with @xmath16 and reference @xcite ends .",
    "we consider now the spectrum of kk excitations of @xmath27 .",
    "the full spectrum of @xmath27 is not known ; however , the eigenvalues of the laplacian were computed in @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the knowledge of the laplacian eigenvalues allows to compute the entire spectrum of hypermultiplets of the theory , corresponding to the chiral operators of the cft .",
    "the result is that there is a chiral multiplet in the @xmath116 representation of @xmath69 for each integer value of k , with dimension @xmath117 .",
    "we naturally associate these multiplets with the series of composite operators @xmath118 where the @xmath110 s indices are totally symmetrized .",
    "a first important result , following from the existence of these hypermultiplets in the kk spectrum , is that the dimension of the combination @xmath119 at the superconformal point must be 1 .",
    "we see that the prediction from the kk spectrum are in perfect agreement with the geometric discussion in the previous section .",
    "operators which are not totally symmetric in the flavor indices do not appear in the spectrum .",
    "the agreement with the proposed cft , however , is only partial .",
    "the chiral operators predicted by supergravity certainly exist in the gauge theory .",
    "however , we can construct many more chiral operators which are not symmetric in flavor indices .",
    "they do not have any counterpart in the kk spectrum .",
    "the superpotential in the case of @xmath16 @xcite had the double purpose of getting rid of the unwanted non - abelian degrees of freedom and of imposing , via the equations of motion , the total symmetrization for chiral and short operators which is predicted both by geometry and by supergravity . here , we are not so lucky , since there is no superpotential .",
    "we can not consider superpotentials of dimension bigger than that considered before ( for example , cubic or quartic in @xmath119 ) because the superpotential  ( [ supoq ] ) is the only one which has dimension compatible with the supergravity predictions . we need to suppose that all the non symmetric operators are not conformal primary . since the relation between r - charge and dimension is only valid for conformal chiral operators , such operators are not protected and therefore may have enormous anomalous dimension , disappearing from the spectrum .",
    "simple examples of chiral but not conformal operators are those obtained by derivatives of the superpotential . since we do not have a superpotential here",
    ", we have to suppose that both the elimination of the unwanted colored massless states as well as the disappearing of the non - symmetric chiral operators emerges as a non - perturbative ir effect .",
    "let us now consider @xmath35 .",
    "the non - abelian theory is now @xmath120 with chiral matter in the following representations of the gauge group @xmath121 the representations of the fundamental fields have been chosen in such a way that they reduce to the abelian theory discussed in the previous section , match with the kk spectrum and imply the existence of baryons predicted by supergravity .",

    "the field content can be conveniently encoded in the quiver diagram in figure [ uvcolor ] .",

    "we can certainly exclude the existence of marginal deformations that preserves the global symmetries of the fixed point , at least for @xmath35 where the kk spectrum is completely known : there is no flavor singlet scalar of dimension 3 in the supergravity spectrum .",
    "other possible sources for exact marginal deformations preserving the global symmetries come from non - trivial cycles . in @xmath16 , for example , the second complex marginal deformation arises from the zero - mode value of the b field on the non - trivial two - cycles of the manifold . in our case",
    ", however , an analogous phenomenon requires reducing the three form on a non - trivial 3-cycle , which does not exist .",
    "it is likely that marginal deformations which break the flavor symmetry but maintain the same number of supersymmetries exist in all these models , since non flavor singlet multiplets with highest component of dimension three can be found in the kk spectrum ; whether these deformation are truly marginal or not needs to be investigated in more details .",

    ", we can use the gauge theory to make predictions about the spectrum of short multiplets one should find in kaluza klein harmonic expansions .",
    "the partial results already known from harmonic analysis on @xmath27 are in agreement with these predictions .    in addition , looking at the results of @xcite , one finds that there is a rich collection of long multiplets whose conformal dimensions are rational and seem to be protected from acquiring quantum corrections .",
    "this is in full analogy with results obtained in the four  dimensional theory associated with the @xmath16 manifold @xcite . actually , we find an even larger class of such _ rational _ long multiplets . for a subclass of them",

    "their presence , which seems universal in all coset models , indicates some general protection mechanism that has still to be clarified .    using the notations of @xcite , the singleton superfields of the @xmath35 theory are the following ones : @xmath237 where @xmath238 are @xmath105 _ flavor _ indices , @xmath239 are @xmath120 _ color _ indices while @xmath240 is a world volume spinorial index of @xmath241 .",
    "the _ supersingletons _ are chiral superfields , so they satisfy @xmath242 .",

    "@xmath248 is in the fundamental representation @xmath249 of @xmath250 and in the @xmath251 of @xmath252 . in eq.s ( [ supsingm ] )",
    "we have followed the conventions that lower @xmath113 indices transform in the fundamental representation , while upper @xmath113 indices transform in the complex conjugate of the fundamental representation .",
    "studying the non perturbative baryon state , obtained by wrapping the @xmath5brane on the supersymmetric cycles of @xmath35 , we have unambiguously established the conformal weights of the supersingletons ( or , more precisely , the conformal weights of the clifford vacua @xmath253 ) that are : @xmath254 for the @xmath27 theory the singleton superfields are instead the following ones : @xmath255 where @xmath256 @xmath257 are flavor indices of @xmath258 , while @xmath259 @xmath257 are color indices of @xmath260 .",
    "also in this case we know the conformal dimension of the supersingleton fields through the calculation of the conformal dimension of the baryon operators .",
    "we have : @xmath261 we now discuss short and long multiplets and the corresponding operators .",
    "our analysis closely parallels the one in @xcite .",
    "when the gauge group is @xmath262 , there is a simple interpretation for the ring of the chiral superfields : they describe the oscillations of the @xmath263branes in the @xmath1 compact transverse directions , so they should have the form of a parametric description of the manifold .",
    "as we explain in section [ mp29 ] , @xmath35 embedded in @xmath264 , can be parametrized by @xmath265 furthermore , the embedding equations can be reformulated in the following way . in a product @xmath266 only the highest weight representation of @xmath105 , that is the completely symmetric in the @xmath109 indices and completely symmetric in the @xmath110 indices , survives .",
    "so , as advocated in eq .",
    "( [ 3k2k ] ) , the ring of the chiral superfields should be composed by superfields of the form @xmath267",
    "first of all , we note that a product of supersingletons is always a chiral superfield , that is , a field satisfying the equation ( see @xcite ) @xmath268 whose general solution has the form @xmath269 following the notations of @xcite , we identify the flavor representations with three nonnegative integers @xmath270 , where @xmath271 , @xmath272 count the boxes of an @xmath109 young diagram according to @xmath273 while @xmath274 is the usual isospin quantum number and counts the boxes of an @xmath110 young diagram as follows @xmath275 the superfields ( [ hyper ] ) are in the same @xmath236 representations as the bulk hypermultiplets that were determined in @xcite through harmonic analysis : @xmath276 in particular , it is worth noticing that every block @xmath277 is in the @xmath278 and has conformal weight @xmath279 as in the kaluza klein spectrum . as a matter of fact , the conformal weight of a product of chiral fields equals the sum of the weights of the single components , as in a free field theory .",
    "this is due to the relation @xmath242 satisfied by the chiral superfields and to the additivity of the hypercharge .",
    "when the gauge group is promoted to @xmath120 , the coordinates become tensors ( see ( [ supsingm ] ) ) .",
    "our conclusion about the composite operators is that the only primary chiral superfields are those which preserve the structure ( [ hyper ] ) .",
    "so , for example , the lowest lying operator is : @xmath280 where the color indices of every @xmath113 are symmetrized .",
    "the generic primary chiral superfield has the form ( [ hyper ] ) , with all the color indices symmetrized before being contracted .",
    "the choice of symmetrizing the color indices is not arbitrary : if we impose symmetrization on the flavor indices , it necessarily follows that also the color indices are symmetrized ( see appendix [ appc ] for a proof of this fact ) .",
    "clearly , the @xmath281 representations ( [ reprhyper ] ) of these fields are the same as in the abelian case , namely those predicted by the @xmath282 correspondence .",
    "it should be noted that in the @xmath174dimensional analogue of these theories , namely in the @xmath16 case @xcite , the restriction of the primary conformal fields to the geometrical chiral ring occurs through the derivatives of the quartic superpotential . as we already noted , in the @xmath48 theories there is no superpotential of dimension @xmath169 which can be introduced and , accordingly , the embedding equations defining the vanishing ideal can not be given as derivatives of a single holomorphic `` function '' .",
    "it follows that there is some other non perturbative and so far unclarified mechanism that suppresses the chiral superfields not belonging to the highest weight representations .",
    "let us know consider the case of the @xmath27 theory . here , as already pointed out , the complete kaluza klein spectrum is still under construction @xcite . yet",
    "the information available in the literature is sufficient to make a comparison between the kaluza klein predictions and the gauge theory at the level of the chiral multiplets ( and also of the graviton multiplets as we show below ) .",
    "looking at table 7 of @xcite , we learn that , in a generic @xmath64 compactification , each hypermultiplet contains a scalar state @xmath283 of energy label @xmath242 , which is actually the clifford vacuum of the representation and corresponds to the world volume field @xmath283 of eq.([phisupfi ] ) . from the general bosonic mass  formulae of @xcite , we know that @xmath283 is related to traceless deformations of the internal metric and its mass is determined by the spectrum of the scalar laplacian on @xmath2 . in the notations of @xcite",
    ", we normalize the scalar harmonics as @xmath284 and we have the mass  formula ( see @xcite or eq.(b.3 ) of @xcite ) @xmath285 which , combined with the general @xmath9 relation between scalar masses and energy labels @xmath286 , yields the formula @xmath287 for the conformal weight of candidate hypermultiplets in terms of the scalar laplacian eigenvalues .",

    "( [ eoformul ] ) , we retrieve the conformal field theory prediction @xmath296 .",
    "this shows that the hypermultiplet spectrum found in kaluza klein harmonic expansions on @xmath27 agrees with the chiral superfields predicted by the conformal gauge theory .",
    "the supergravity mass  spectrum on @xmath64 , where @xmath2 is sasakian , contains a number of _ ultrashort _ or _ massless _",
    "multiplets that correspond to the unbroken local gauge symmetries of the vacuum .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "the massless @xmath0 graviton multiplet @xmath298 2 .",
    "the massless @xmath0 vector multiplets of the flavor group @xmath299 3 .   the massless @xmath0 vector multiplets associated with the non  trivial harmonic 2forms of @xmath2 ( the betti multiplets ) .",
    "each of these massless multiplets must have a suitable gauge theory interpretation .",
    "indeed , also on the gauge theory side , the ultra  short multiplets are associated with the symmetries of the theory ( global in this case ) and are given by the corresponding conserved noether currents .",
    "we begin with the stress  energy superfield @xmath300 which has a pair of symmetric @xmath241 spinor indices and satisfies the conservation equation @xmath301 in components , the @xmath160expansion of this superfield yields the stress energy tensor @xmath302 , the @xmath0 supercurrents @xmath303 ( @xmath304 ) and the @xmath38 r  symmetry current @xmath305 .",
    "obviously @xmath306 is a singlet with respect to the flavor group @xmath299 and it has @xmath307 this corresponds to the massless graviton multiplet of the bulk and explains the first entry in the above enumeration",

    "this explains the second item of the above enumeration .    in the specific theories under consideration",
    ", we can easily construct the flavor currents in terms of the supersingletons : @xmath311 these currents satisfy eq.([eqcurrents ] ) and are in the right representations of @xmath105 .",
    "their hypercharge is @xmath312 .",
    "the conformal weight is not the one obtained by a naive sum , being the theory interacting .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the conserved currents satisfy @xmath313 , hence @xmath314 .",
    "let us finally identify the gauge theory superfields associated with the betti multiplets . as we stressed in the introduction",
    ", the non abelian gauge theory has @xmath315 rather than @xmath316 as gauge group .",
    "the abelian gauge symmetries that were used to obtain the toric description of the manifold @xmath35 and @xmath27 in the one  brane case @xmath317 are not promoted to gauge symmetries in the many brane regime @xmath318 .",
    "yet , they survive as exact global symmetries of the gauge theory .",
    "the associated conserved currents provide the superfields corresponding to the massless betti multiplets found in the kaluza klein spectrum of the bulk .",
    "as the reader can notice , the @xmath141 betti number of each manifold always agrees with the number of independent @xmath38 groups needed to give a toric description of the same manifold .",
    "it is therefore fairly easy to identify the betti currents of our gauge theories .",
    "for instance for the @xmath35 case the betti current is @xmath319 the two betti currents of @xmath27 are similarly written down from the toric description .",

    ", we have @xmath314 and the betti currents provide the gauge theory interpretation of the massless betti multiplets .      using the massless currents reviewed in the previous section and the chiral superfields",
    ", one has all the building blocks necessary to construct the constrained superfields that correspond to all the short multiplets found in the kaluza klein spectrum .    as originally discussed in @xcite and applied to the explicitly worked out spectra in @xcite , short @xmath320 multiplets",
    "correspond to the saturation of the unitarity bound that relates the energy ( or conformal dimension ) @xmath200 and hypercharge @xmath321 of the clifford vacuum to the highest spin @xmath322 contained in the multiplet .",
    "hence short multiplets occur when : @xmath323 in abstract representation theory condition ( [ shortening ] ) implies that a subset of states of the hilbert space have zero norm and decouple from the others .",
    "hence the representation is shortened . in superfield language ,",
    "the @xmath160expansion of the superfield is shortened by imposing a suitable differential constraint , invariant with respect to poincar supersymmetry @xcite .",

    "( [ shortening ] ) .",
    "then we can compare their flavor representations with those of the short multiplets obtained in kaluza klein expansions . in the case of the @xmath35 theory , where the kaluza klein spectrum is known , we find complete agreement and",
    "hence we explicitly verify the @xmath282 correspondence .",
    "for the @xmath27 manifold we make instead a prediction in the reverse direction : the gauge theory realization predicts the outcome of harmonic analysis . while we wait for the construction of the complete spectrum @xcite , we can partially verify the correspondence using the information available at the moment , namely the spectrum of the scalar laplacian @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory interpretation of these multiplets is quite simple .",

    "it is natural to extend this identification to the non - abelian case .    given the chiral multiplet spectrum ( [ reprhyper ] ) and the dimension of the stress energy current ( [ reprhyper ] ) , we immediately get the spectrum of superfields ( [ phicorto ] ) for the case @xmath35 : @xmath327 this exactly coincides with the spectrum of short graviton multiplets found in kaluza klein theory through harmonic analysis @xcite .    for the @xmath27 case the same analysis gives the following prediction for the short graviton multiplets : @xmath328 we can make a consistency check on this prediction just relying on the spectrum of the laplacian ( [ h0q111 ] ) . indeed , looking at table 4 of @xcite , we see that in a short graviton multiplet the mass of the spin two particle is @xmath329 looking instead at eq .",
    "( b.3 ) of the same paper , we see that such a mass is equal to the eigenvalue of the scalar laplacian @xmath330 . therefore , for consistency of the prediction ( [ reprshortgravq111 ] ) , we should have @xmath331 for the representation @xmath332 .",
    "this is indeed the value provided by eq .",
    "( [ h0q111 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that when we write the operator ( [ phicorto ] ) , it is understood that _ all color indices are symmetrized before taking the contraction . _",

    "the compact form @xmath863 of @xmath409 is embedded in @xmath864 as @xmath865 where @xmath122 is in @xmath110 . as",
    "such it stabilizes a line in a @xmath408-plane in @xmath845 .",
    "if we look at the fibration @xmath866 given by forgetting the second element of the flags @xmath867 , we see that the map @xmath868 is a section of @xmath600 which is @xmath864 invariant .",
    "@xmath392 is the image of this section and hence @xmath869 it is clear that the sasakian fibration is @xmath870 and obviously @xmath871 .",
    "notice that @xmath872 and we have a commutative diagram @xmath873 where the action of @xmath864 on @xmath861 preserves the fibration given by the bottom line .",
    "if we forget about this fibration , @xmath861 can be considered a homogeneous space of @xmath874 and again the sasakian fibration over it is @xmath24 .",
    "there are two more ways of getting @xmath24 as a homogeneous space ( namely @xmath875 and @xmath876 ) , but the action of the group does not preserve the @xmath38 fibration over @xmath861 .",
    "in this appendix we show that the symmetrization of _ flavor _ indices for the chiral operators of the @xmath35 theory implies the symmetrization of the color indices . for this purpose ,",
    "let us concentrate on the indices of one of the two @xmath113 _ color _ groups .",
    "the problem is to construct uncolored fields polynomially depending ( meaning totally symmetric ) on the @xmath877 and @xmath878 .",
    "since these fields belong to the _ irreps _ @xmath879 and @xmath880 respectively , we need @xmath124 @xmath122 s and @xmath125 @xmath123 s to have the right number of indices to saturate .",
    "hence , we have to find dual irreducible subrepresentations in the decompositions @xmath881 @xmath882 the first two terms in these decompositions are obviously paired .",
    "we claim that these are the only ones .",
    "if there is another pair of _ irreps _ @xmath883 , @xmath884 which are dual , then each must be invariant under both the permutation subgroups @xmath885 and @xmath886 of @xmath887 .",
    "so we have only to show that these subgroups generate the whole @xmath887 .",
    "first observe that we can order @xmath888 letters in @xmath125 triples in such a way that @xmath889 acts with @xmath231 permuting letters of the first triple , and @xmath890 permuting the triples .",
    "the action of @xmath891 is faithful but otherwise arbitrary . to these actions",
    "we can associate a graph whose vertices are the triples and whose links connect the triples which contain letters permuted by @xmath892 ; @xmath893 permutes the links , while @xmath890 permutes vertices .",
    "notice that each link connects in fact two precise letters within triples ; it does nt matter which ones , since there is symmetry within each triple .",
    "if two vertices are connected by a link we can permute any two letters in these vertices , using @xmath231 within every single vertex and @xmath892 exchanging the letters at the endpoints of the links .",
    "thus , we have the action of the full symmetric group of the letters belonging to every connected component of the graph .",
    "if there are two disconnected components , we can permute a letter in one component with a letter in the other as follows .",
    "first permute the nodes to which they belong by the action of @xmath890 ; then use the symmetric group of each component to put the extra two letters of each involved triple at the endpoints of a link .",
    "next exchange the couple of links got in this way by an action of @xmath893 . finally use again the symmetric group of each component to restore the sequence of letters we started from , except for the two which have been exchanged .    summing up",
    "this proves that , if we consider combinations of the @xmath122 s and @xmath123 s completely symmetric on _ flavor _ indices , the structure of the saturation of the _ color _ indices is unique : the totally symmetric one saturated with its dual .",
