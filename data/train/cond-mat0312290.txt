    "the new fqh states are found to be spin - polarized and occur between the neighboring @xmath0 and @xmath15 states of the jain sequence,@xcite corresponding to one and two completely filled composite fermion ( cf ) ll s , respectively .",
    "some of them , such as @xmath16 or @xmath11,@xcite appear in the standard hierarchy of quasiparticle ( qp ) condensates formulated by haldane@xcite and halperin,@xcite but their `` hierarchical '' interpretation was earlier ruled out @xcite because of the specific ( subharmonic ) form of the qp ",
    "qp interaction .",
    "others , such as the @xmath4 or @xmath17 states , do not belong to the haldane hierarchy , and the origin of their incompressibility is puzzling in an even more obvious way .",
    "recently there have been attempts@xcite to explain these states in terms of `` multi - flavor '' cf pictures , with coexisting cf s carrying different numbers of fluxes ( vortices ) .",
    "being equivalent to the cf hierarchy@xcite of laughlin - correlated spin - polarized qp states , not only are these models not conceptually new , but they are also unjustified at the qp fillings in question.@xcite in fact , some of the numerical results obtained earlier in a slightly different context@xcite and more detailed results presented here show that they _ do not _ describe the new fqh states .",
    "the appeal of the cf models lies in the fact that they allow one to think of a more complicated fqh state at filling factor @xmath13 as a cf - analogue of a simpler and better understood state at an effective cf filling factor @xmath18 .",
    "the best known examples are @xmath0 and @xmath15 states corresponding to @xmath19 and 2 , respectively . in the present case @xmath16 and @xmath20 correspond to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , that is to one - third and one - half filled first excited cf ll ( cf - ll@xmath23 ) , respectively .",
    "however , it can not come as a surprise that the cf model does not always work .",
    "it is valid only for systems which support laughlin correlations , and those only occur if the interactions are sufficiently strong at short range.@xcite moreover , it is known precisely that `` sufficiently strong '' means that the interaction pseudopotential is superharmonic .",
    "@xcite it should also be noted that the cf analogy is not sufficient to explain all new observed states regardless of the fact that the ( reapplied ) cf model _ does not_@xcite generally describe correlations between the cf s themselves .",
    "specifically , the @xmath24 state corresponds to @xmath25 , while the electronic state at this filling is _ not _ incompressible .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the results of our `` numerical experiments '' for the new fqh states and show that they are described by grouping of qp s into pairs@xcite ( although probably without pair  pair laughlin correlations@xcite ) or into larger clusters,@xcite rather than by a multi - flavor cf picture .",
    "to do so , we : ( i ) present results of extensive numerical diagonalization studies of up to 14 interacting laughlin quasielectrons ( qe s ) ; ( ii ) demonstrate directly the qe clustering by the calculation of pair amplitudes ; ( iii ) identify the series of finite - size nondegenerate ground states at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; ( iv ) investigate the dependence of the stability of these states on the details of the qe",

    "qe correlations than those of electrons in the laughlin@xcite or moore  read @xcite states ; ( vii ) construct the equivalent quasihole ( qh ) states at @xmath26 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; ( viii ) discuss a recent model@xcite assuming pairing of qp s and laughlin correlations between the pairs ( originally proposed by halperin@xcite for electrons in ll@xmath14 ) ; and ( ix ) propose an explanation for the fqh state observed at @xmath27 .",
    "standard numerical calculations for @xmath28 electrons are not useful for studying the new states , because convincing results require too large values of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we take advantage of the knowledge @xcite of the dominant features of the pseudopotential @xmath29 of the qe ",
    "qe interaction ( i.e. , the qe  qe interaction energy @xmath30 as a function of relative pair angular momentum @xmath31 ) , and diagonalize the ( much smaller ) interaction hamiltonian of the @xmath32-qe systems .",
    "this procedure was earlier shown@xcite to accurately reproduce the low - energy @xmath28-electron spectra at filling factors @xmath13 between @xmath2 and @xmath15 .",
    "it was also used in a similar , many - qe calculation by lee _",
    "@xcite ( who , however , have not found support for qe clustering ) .",
    "our results confirm series of nondegenerate ground states with finite excitation gaps at @xmath33 , twice the qe angular momentum , equal to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ( the last two states are particle  hole symmetric ) .",
    "these series extrapolate to @xmath37 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , and to the electron filling factors @xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively . the fact that the @xmath38 sequence occurs at @xmath39 rather than @xmath40 implies that this state is _ not _ a laughlin state of qe s ( or cf s ) .",
    "indeed , the assumption that the @xmath38 sequence must be described by the relation @xmath41 led to its being overlooked in earlier finite - size calculations.@xcite the identified sequence is also different from @xmath42 characteristic of halperin s paired state@xcite corresponding to @xmath43 . on the other hand , the value of @xmath44 for the @xmath45 sequence suggests that this state could be a halperin paired qe state ( laughlin state of qe pairs)@xcite similar to the moore ",
    "read@xcite state of electrons at the half - filling of ll@xmath23 .",
    "however , the squared overlaps with the moore  read state are very small ( @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) , and the nondegenerate ground states occur in this series only for odd numbers of qe pairs ( @xmath48 , 5 , and 7 ) , which implies that the nature of this state is different .",
    "the comparison of the qh  qh and qe  qe pseudopotentials ( which differ mainly by a hard - core at @xmath49 for the qh s ) result in the following correspondence relation for the incompressible qh and qe states @xmath50 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , this relation gives @xmath51 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath24 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively , all of which have also been observed experimentally .    to understand the origin of incompressibility in the new states we explore an idea@xcite of laughlin states of qp pairs ( originally proposed by halperin@xcite to describe electron pairing in ll@xmath14 ) .",
    "grouping of qe s or qh s into pairs or even larger clusters at sufficiently large filling factors can be predicted from the form of qe  qe and qh  qh pseudopotentials , characterized by strong minima at @xmath52 state and @xmath53 .",
    "it is clearly demonstrated by the calculation of the appropriate pair amplitude coefficients@xcite ( related to the fractional grandparentage@xcite ) in the many - qe ground states . in halperin s",
    "paired state , laughlin correlations between the qp pairs would depend on the superharmonic behavior of the pair ",
    "pair interaction pseudopotential , @xmath54 , at the relevant values of @xmath55 , the relative angular momentum of two pairs .",
    "the analysis of the calculated @xmath56 suggests that of the whole sequence of incompressible laughlin states of qe pairs , only @xmath1 might satisfy the condition for laughlin correlations .",
    "this appears to be in agreement with our `` numerical experiments , '' which reveal the @xmath1 series at @xmath44 ( as predicted for halperin s paired state ) and the @xmath57 series at @xmath39 ( different from @xmath58 of a halperin s paired state ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we find several strong indications that halperin s paired state does not occur for qe s at neither @xmath1 nor @xmath2 .",
    "the essential information about the interaction of particles confined to some hilbert space can be obtained by defining the value of interaction energy for all allowed pair states . for charged particles confined to a ll in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", the relative motion is strongly quantized .",
    "the orbital pair eigenstates can be labeled with a single discrete quantum number , relative angular momentum @xmath31 .",
    "this number is a non - negative integer ; it must be odd ( even ) for a pair of identical fermions ( bosons ) , and it increases with increasing average distance @xmath59 between the two particles .    in haldane s spherical geometry,@xcite most convenient for finite - size calculations ,",
    "the ll@xmath14 is represented by a degenerate shell of single - particle angular momentum @xmath60 .",
    "here @xmath61 is the strength of dirac monopole in the center , defined as @xmath62 , the total flux of the magnetic field @xmath63 through the surface of radius @xmath64 ( using the definition of the magnetic length @xmath65 , this can be written as @xmath66 ) .",
    "the total pair angular momentum @xmath67 ( here , @xmath68 means total angular momentum of @xmath32 particles , and @xmath67 is reserved for @xmath69 ) results from an addition of two angular momenta @xmath70 of individual particles , and it is connected to the relative pair angular momentum via relation @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the maximum value of @xmath72 ( for bosons ) or @xmath73 ( for fermions ) corresponds to the smallest pair state with @xmath74 or 1 .",
    "the pair interaction energy @xmath75 expressed as a function of @xmath31 is called the pseudopotential , and the series of its parameters @xmath76 entirely determines many - body correlations . on a sphere , @xmath77 and",
    "thus the number of pseudopotential parameters is finite .",
    "however , even in an infinite ( planar ) system , only those few leading parameters at the values of @xmath31 corresponding to the average distance @xmath59 not exceeding the correlation length @xmath78 are of significance ( provided that the correlations are indeed characterized by finite @xmath79 ) .",
    "remarkably , even for the completely repulsive interactions , different correlations can result in a partially filled shell depending on the form of @xmath76 .",
    "for example , if @xmath75 _ increases _ as a function of @xmath31 ( as in atomic shells in the absence of magnetic field ) , the low - energy many - body states obey hund s rule and tend to have the maximum possible degeneracy ( i.e. , the maximum @xmath80 ) . in the opposite extreme situation , when @xmath75 _ decreases _ sufficiently quickly@xcite as a function of @xmath31 , laughlin correlations occur .",
    "these correlations are defined as the tendency to avoid pair states with one or more smallest values of @xmath31 , i.e. , with the largest repulsion ( the relative occupation of different pair states in a many - body state is a well - defined quantity , given by the pair amplitude coefficient@xcite ) .    as a result of laughlin correlations ,",
    "the low - energy many - body states usually have small degeneracy and effects commonly associated with the fqh physics occur , including the formation of incompressible ground states at certain values of @xmath13 .",
    "what is often not realized or overlooked is that it is precisely the laughlin correlations that justify the cf picture . in other words , the mean field cf picture that attaches @xmath81 magnetic flux quanta ( or vortices ) to each fermion and predicts the family of jain wavefunctions for the lowest energy states is correct",
    "_ if and only if _ those fermions have laughlin correlations , i.e. , the lowest energy states indeed maximally avoid having pair states with @xmath82 .",
    "for example , in order to bind @xmath81 vortices and transform into cf s , electrons must have laughlin correlations ( and indeed they do in ll@xmath14 ) .",
    "these cf s ( or , more precisely , the qp s in partially filled cf - ll s ) would bind additional vortices and turn into `` higher - order '' cf s if they themselves had laughlin correlations ( and in this paper we show that , at the relevant filling factors , they _ do not _ ) .    another important class of pseudopotentials are the `` harmonic '' ones , i.e. , those for which parameters @xmath83 fall on a straight line when plotted as a function of the average squared distance @xmath84 . clearly , all harmonic potentials @xmath85 have this property regardless of the ll confinement .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that for particles confined in an angular momentum shell on a sphere , @xmath86 is a linear ( increasing in case of repulsion ) function of squared pair angular momentum , @xmath87 .",
    "it follows from considering the large - radius limit ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) that on a plane ( or on a `` large '' sphere , i.e. , for @xmath90 ) , @xmath86 is a linear function of @xmath31 .",
    "the importance of the harmonic pseudopotential lies in the fact that it causes _ no _ correlations , i.e. , all many - body states with the same total angular momentum @xmath68 are degenerate ( and their energy is just a linear function of @xmath91 or @xmath31 , depending on geometry).@xcite it is thus only the anharmonic part of @xmath76 that causes correlations , while the harmonic part only shifts the entire energy spectrum by a constant times @xmath91 or @xmath31 .    from the analysis of the sum rules@xcite obeyed by the pair amplitudes",
    "@xmath92 measuring the fraction of pairs with relative pair angular momentum @xmath31 out of the total number of @xmath93 pairs in an @xmath32-particle state @xmath94 , it has been shown@xcite that laughlin correlations occur near filling factor @xmath13 if the dominant anharmonic contribution to @xmath75 is positive at the avoided values of @xmath31 . for example , for fermions at @xmath95 , the pseudopotential @xmath76 must decrease `` superlinearly '' through any three values @xmath96 beginning with @xmath97 . by the superlinear ( i.e. , superharmonic ) behavior we mean that @xmath98 only then do laughlin correlations occur and justify the use of the mean field cf transformation that attaches @xmath99 fluxes ( vortices ) to each electron .",
    "moreover , any pseudopotential that is strongly superharmonic at short range causes the same ( laughlin ) correlations which explains the robust character of the fqh states in realistic systems or in model calculations .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that it is the superharmonic behavior of the coulomb repulsion @xmath100 in ll@xmath14 in the entire range of @xmath31 that explains the success of the cf picture through the entire jain sequence of fractions .",
    "@xcite it was also shown@xcite ( by direct calculation of pair amplitudes ) that because the coulomb pseudopotential in ll@xmath23 is roughly _ linear _ between @xmath49 and 5 , the electrons tend to form pairs with @xmath49 when filling a fraction @xmath101 of ll@xmath23 .",
    "this is exactly the opposite behavior to the avoidance of this pair state that would characterize a state with laughlin correlations and that could justify the cf picture ( sometimes erroneously used in literature to describe the fqh states at @xmath102 , @xmath103 , or @xmath104 ) .",
    "let us stress here that the mean field cf picture simply mimics the fact that ( in a laughlin - correlated system ) each electron drags a @xmath49 correlation hole with it  by replacing the `` bare '' electron ll degeneracy with an appropriately smaller , `` effective '' one ( and an effective cf magnetic field @xmath105 is just an intuitive physical picture that can not be treated literally ) .",
    "in fact , it has recently been demonstrated@xcite that the adiabatic addition of flux ( instead of addition via gauge transformation ) automatically gives rise to laughlin correlations without the need of any mean field approximation .",
    "having said this , there simply are _ no _ cf s in the @xmath106 , @xmath103 , or @xmath104 states , let alone the cf pairs . instead , at least the moore ",
    "read state at @xmath106 is clearly a paired state of _",
    "electrons_@xcite ( although models involving pairing of cf s in this state can also be found in literature@xcite ) .",
    "it is surprisingly often overlooked that the fqh effect does not prove the existence of cf s or laughlin correlations , but only the existence of a nondegenerate ground state separated from the continuum of qp excitations by a finite gap  the property which can also result from correlations of a different nature .",
    "it is indeed quite remarkable that the knowledge of the interaction pseudopotential @xmath76 at short range is sufficient to predict or rule out laughlin correlations in different fqh systems .",
    "@xcite however , it must be carefully noticed that the predicted absence of laughlin correlations does not preclude the fqh effect itself , only a microscopic origin of the effect attributable to laughlin correlations .",
    "it should also be realized that immediate application of the cf model without studying the interactions between the relevant particles ( electrons , qp s , etc . ) whenever real or numerical experiments reveal incompressibility is not justified .",
    "precisely such a situation was recently encountered with the discovery of new fqh states at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , etc .",
    ", which turn out not to be laughlin or jain states ( of qp s ) despite being incompressible .",
    "it follows from the preceding discussion that in order to explain the origin of incompressibility in the new fqh states , one has to begin with the identification of the relevant ( quasi ) particles ( electrons , holes , laughlin qp s , cf s , excitons , skyrmions ,  ) , analyze their interaction pseudopotentials , understand their correlations , and finally derive the filling factors @xmath13 at which those correlations cause incompressibility .",
    "in contrast to the cf model ( which , nevertheless , is still very elegant and useful _",
    "after _ it is proven valid for a particular system ) , this line of thought is free of unproven assumptions , such as that of a cancellation between the coulomb and gauge interactions beyond the mean field .",
    "it is well - established that a ( laughlin - correlated ) system of electrons at @xmath107 can be viewed as one of ( fractionally charged and thus less strongly interacting ) qe s moving in the underlying laughlin @xmath0 ground state .",
    "this is elegantly pictured in the cf model , in which the laughlin state corresponds to the completely filled cf - ll@xmath14 , and",
    "the qe s correspond to the ( weakly interacting ) particles moving in the ( partially filled ) cf - ll@xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the electron system at @xmath108 can be viewed as the qh s moving over the @xmath0 background ( with the qh s pictured as vacancies in cf - ll@xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , we begin the study of the new fqh states in the @xmath109 range with the analysis of the qe ",
    "qe and qh  qh pseudopotentials .",
    "in the following we will use the fermionic statistics to describe qp s which is consistent with the cf picture ( and conversion to bosons or anyons can be done in a standard way@xcite ) .",
    "the qualitative behavior of @xmath110 at short range is well - known from the numerical studies of small systems . @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) we compare @xmath29 calculated for the systems of @xmath111 to 12 electrons .    as the calculation involves subtraction of the @xmath32-electron energies corresponding to zero , one , and two qe s that ( in finite systems ) occur at different values of @xmath112 ( i.e. , different surface curvatures ) , the zero of energy is determined much less accurately than the relative values of different pseudopotential parameters . however , when the data for each @xmath31 are extrapolated to large @xmath32 , the positive sign of @xmath29 is restored , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "still , only the relative values are of importance , since adding a constant to @xmath76 does not affect correlations and only shifts the whole many - body spectrum by a ( different ) constant . on the other hand , the repulsive character of the qp  qp interaction and the long - range behavior of @xmath113 follow from the fact that qp s are charged particles ( the form of qp charge density affects @xmath114 only at short range , comparable to the qp size ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) we plot @xmath29 obtained more recently by lee _ et al._@xcite using a somewhat different approach .",
    "since it confirms the oscillatory behavior at short range in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and behaves as expected at long range , we will use it later to diagonalize interaction in the systems of more than two qe s .    clearly ,",
    "the dominant features of @xmath30 are the small value at @xmath49 and a strong maximum at @xmath115 . similar analysis for @xmath116 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) for @xmath117 reveals the maxima at @xmath49 and 5 , and the nearly vanishing @xmath118 .",
    "actually , it follows from the comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) that the slightly reduced energy scale for @xmath119 and the additional strongly repulsive state at @xmath120 are the only significant differences between the two pseudopotentials . the @xmath121 correspondence and",
    "the fact that @xmath122 is the largest of all qe or qh parameters will be used to construct the qh states corresponding to the incompressible qe states studied numerically in detail .",
    "the above conclusions about the properties of qp  qp pseudopotentials weakly depend on such assumptions as zero layer thickness @xmath123 or infinite magnetic field @xmath63 , and their oscillations at small @xmath31 persist in realistic fqh systems .",
    "it is noteworthy that this result can not be obtained from the _ literally understood _ original formulation of the cf model in which the weak `` residual '' cf  cf interactions are said to result from partial cancellation of strong coulomb and gauge interactions between the electrons .",
    "this is because these two interactions have different character and , for example , depend differently on @xmath123 or @xmath63.@xcite",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that @xmath122 is the strongest anharmonic contribution to @xmath116 .",
    "this causes the maximum avoidance of the two - qh state with @xmath49 ( laughlin qh  qh correlations ) and justifies the cf transformation with @xmath99 fluxes attached to each qh ( i.e. , such reapplication of the cf transformation to the vacancies in the partially filled cf - ll@xmath14 ) .",
    "the states of cf - qh s obtained in this way form the lowest band of qh states at their filling factors @xmath124 . at @xmath125",
    ", the qh laughlin state occurs that corresponds to the @xmath126 hierarchy / jain state . at @xmath127 , the cf - qh s ( unlike electrons )",
    "do not bind any more vortices because of the subharmonic character of @xmath116 around @xmath115 .    if follows from the @xmath128 correspondence seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the pseudopotential for the interacting cf - qh s is similar to that of qe s . to confirm this",
    ", we have calculated this pseudopotential in a standard way,@xcite by numerical diagonalization of @xmath32 qh s interacting through @xmath129 in a shell of angular momentum @xmath130 .",
    "the similarity between @xmath29 and @xmath131 not only confirms that no additional fluxes can be attached to the cf - qh s ( i.e. , not more than two fluxes to the original qh s ) , but it also implies that the same correlations will occur in qe and cf - qh systems , and that any incompressible qe state must have its cf - qh counterpart at the same filling factor .",
    "the conversion of the cf - qh filling factors to @xmath132 gives eq .",
    "( [ eq_qeqh ] ) , connecting the observed states into pairs : @xmath133 ( @xmath20 and @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath5 and @xmath11 ) , and ( @xmath6 and @xmath12 ) . using the hierarchy equation , @xmath134 where",
    "@xmath135 or @xmath136 , it can also easily be shown that the two fractions in each pair @xmath137 are connected by @xmath138",
    "while the hierarchy interpretation is certainly invalid for the three pairs of states discussed in the preceding section , and an alternative explanation must exist for their incompressibility , the situation with another observed state , @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath139 , is less obvious .",
    "its qh counterpart at @xmath140 has not been observed , and it is not clear if the finite width @xmath123 of the actual experimental system ( which tends to weaken oscillations in @xmath114 ) does not lift @xmath141 enough compared to @xmath142 that avoiding both @xmath49 and 3 at the same time ( i.e. , formation of the laughlin state of the qe s with @xmath139 as assumed in the cf hierarchy picture ) becomes energetically favorable . if true , this would be a similar scenario to that in ll@xmath23 , where the @xmath0 state _ is not _ a laughlin state , but the @xmath143 state _",
    "is_. if the @xmath27 state could indeed only be observed in sufficiently wide electron systems , then it is possible that the unobserved @xmath140 state ( corresponding to @xmath144 ) would simply require slightly larger width to become incompressible .",
    "the difference between critical widths could probably be explained by the fact that qh  qh pseudopotential parameter that must be lifted is at a larger @xmath31 ( at 3 instead of 1 ) which thus corresponds to a larger average in - plane qh  qh separation @xmath59 .",
    "unfortunately , our estimates of the @xmath110 pseudopotentials are not sufficiently accurate to make definite predictions about the critical widths .",
    "however , the @xmath145 electron calculation for the qe s shows that @xmath141 indeed moves up relative to @xmath146 and @xmath147 when the width is increased from @xmath148 to 20  nm . similar behavior was found for @xmath129 calculated for @xmath111 : the @xmath118 moved up relative to @xmath149 and @xmath150 with increasing width , only at a smaller rate @xmath151 than it did for qe s .",
    "although in the following discussion of qp states we will concentrate on the qe s , the extension to qh s remains valid as discussed above . even without further numerical proof",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] alone that the qe s interacting through @xmath152 will not have laughlin correlations .",
    "this implies that the mean field cf transformation _ can not _ be reapplied to the particles or vacancies in cf - ll@xmath23 .",
    "this rules out the simple hierarchy picture of the @xmath16 state , as well as the ( equivalent though even less justified ) interpretation involving the coexistence of cf s carrying two and four flux quanta ( or vortices).@xcite in the latter , `` multi - flavor '' cf model , the cf s carrying two additional flux quanta are constructed by a reapplication of the cf transformation to those qp s in the @xmath2-filled cf - ll@xmath23 .",
    "this procedure was actually first proposed by sitko _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite so it is not new , and it is equivalent to the haldane hierarchy ( except that it is expressed in terms of fermionic rather than bosonic qe s compared to haldane s original paper@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been clearly demonstrated@xcite in small systems with superharmonic pseudopotentials @xmath75 that adding @xmath99 , 4 , ",

    "therefore at least some of the qe s will form such pairs ( qe@xmath156 s ) or even larger clusters ( qe@xmath157 s ) at filling factors @xmath158 ( when the avoidance of both @xmath49 and 3 at the same time is not possible ) .",

    "its only non - vanishing coefficients are @xmath330 it is known@xcite that the correlations characteristic of electrons in the partially filled ll@xmath14 and ll@xmath23 are accurately reproduced by @xmath331 with @xmath332 and @xmath298 , respectively .",
    "similarly , by the comparison of pair amplitudes , we have confirmed that @xmath331 with @xmath333 causes correlations characteristic of qe s in their partially filled ll .",
    "we have repeated the diagonalization of a few finite systems with @xmath44 and @xmath35 , for @xmath334 varying between 0 and 1 , in order to answer the following two questions .",
    "first , to what extent is the stability of the identified @xmath4 and @xmath5 states affected by the ( width - dependent ) details of the qe ",
    "qe interaction ? and",
    "second , does a phase transition occur for values of @xmath334 between @xmath298 and 1 , indicating a different origin of the incompressibility of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states and their electron counterparts ( in ll@xmath23 ) at @xmath106 and @xmath103 ?",
    "the latter question is naturally motivated by our two observations : ( i ) the @xmath44 sequence of nondegenerate ground states occurs only for odd numbers of qe pairs ( @xmath48 , 5 , and 7 ) , in contrast to the situation in ll@xmath23 where they occurred for any value of @xmath175 , and ( ii ) the @xmath1 has small overlap with the moore  read state ( of qe s ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot the @xmath177 excitation energy gap @xmath335 ( difference between the two lowest energy levels at @xmath177 ) , as a function of @xmath334 .",
    "a minimum in @xmath336 signals a ( forbidden ) level crossing , i.e. , a phase transition in the @xmath177 subspace .",
    "such minima occur near @xmath337 for all values of @xmath32 and for both @xmath44 and @xmath35 .",
    "they reveal destruction of laughlin correlations that occur for small @xmath334 ( e.g. , for electrons in ll@xmath14 ) and formation of incompressible @xmath338 and @xmath2 states of a different ( paired ) character that occur for @xmath339 ( e.g. , for electrons in ll@xmath23 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , similar strong minima occur at @xmath340 for @xmath111 and 12 ( marked with thick lines ) .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that the correlations between the qe s and between the electrons in ll@xmath23 ( both at the half - filling ) are different . in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) and ( b ) , additional weaker minima between @xmath337 and 1 appear also for other combinations of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this confirms that the @xmath338 and @xmath2 incompressible states of qe s are generally different from those of the electrons in ll@xmath23 , despite the fact that they both usually occur at the same values of @xmath44 and @xmath35 in the finite systems .",
    "the absolute excitation gaps @xmath341 of the @xmath177 ground states ( difference between the lowest energies at @xmath294 and @xmath177 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "the negative value of @xmath295 means that the absolute ground state is degenerate ( i.e. , has @xmath294 ) , and the abrupt changes in the slope of @xmath341 occur whenever level crossings occur for the lowest @xmath294 state .",
    "clearly , except for @xmath111 and 12 with @xmath44 , the lowest @xmath177 states remain the absolute ground states of the system in the whole range of @xmath334 between @xmath298 and 1 .",
    "this was first noticed by greiter _",
    "et al._@xcite for @xmath145 at half - filling , and it implies that the incompressibility of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 ground states will not be easily destroyed in experimental systems by a minor deviation from the model qe ",
    "qe pseudopotential used here in the numerical diagonalization .",
    "let us finally examine the dependence of the leading pair amplitudes , @xmath173 and @xmath172 , on @xmath334 . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we plot the number of pairs @xmath342 , divided by @xmath32 .",
    "a transition from laughlin correlations at @xmath343 to pairing at @xmath344 ( and possibly grouping into larger clusters at @xmath345 ) is clearly visible in each curve .",
    "it is also confirmed that just as the laughlin ground state remains virtually insensitive to the exact form of the interaction pseudopotential @xmath346 as long as it is strongly _ superharmonic _ at short range , the correlations in the @xmath1 and states @xmath2 are quite independent of the details of the qe  qe interaction , as long as @xmath30 is strongly _ subharmonic _ at short range .",
    "this result supports our expectation that the incompressible qe ground states found here numerically indeed describe the fqh @xmath4 and @xmath5 electron states observed in experiment .",
    "on the other hand , correlations at @xmath339 ( electrons in ll@xmath23 ) , characterized by having @xmath347 , are quite different from those at @xmath345 ( qe s ) , characterized by having the minimum possible @xmath172 , much smaller than @xmath173 .",
    "finally , with thick lines in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) we have marked the curves for @xmath111 and 12 in the vicinity of @xmath348 at which the forbidden crossings were found in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) .",
    "a different behavior of @xmath349 and @xmath350 for these two values of @xmath32 is clearly visible .",
    "using exact numerical diagonalization in haldane spherical geometry , we have studied the energy spectra and wavefunctions of up to @xmath277 interacting qe s in the laughlin @xmath0 parent state ( i.e. , cf s each carrying two flux quanta ) .",
    "we have demonstrated by direct calculation of the pair amplitudes @xmath155 that , at their sufficiently large filling factor ( @xmath351 ) , the qe s form pairs or larger clusters , with a significant occupation of the minimum relative pair angular momentum , @xmath49 .",
    "the qe ( and analogous qh ) clustering is an opposite behavior to laughlin correlations characterizing e.g.  electrons partially filling ll@xmath14 .",
    "therefore it invalidates the reapplication of the cf picture to the individual qe s or qh s ( and thus also the equivalent multi - flavor cf model ) and precludes the simple hierarchy interpretation of any incompressible states at @xmath352 or @xmath353 .",
    "the series of finite - size nondegenerate ground states at qe filling factors @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 have been identified .",
    "these values correspond to the electronic filling factors @xmath354 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , at which the fqh effect has recently been discovered.@xcite due to a discussed similarity between the qe ",
    "qe and qh  qh interactions , these three qe states have their qh counterparts at @xmath51 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath24 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , all of which have also been experimentally observed.@xcite finally , it is argued that the reported@xcite @xmath27 fqh state might be a standard hierarchy state ( laughlin @xmath355 state ) , although it could only be observed in sufficiently wide systems .",
    "its qh counterpart at @xmath140 ( laughlin @xmath356 state ) would require a larger width than @xmath27 which might explain why it has not yet been observed .",
    "the finite - size @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 states of qe s ( cf s in ll@xmath23 ) are found at the same values of @xmath357 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 as the @xmath106 ( moore  read @xcite ) , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 fqh states of electrons in ll@xmath23 , respectively , despite the different electron and cf pseudopotentials .",
    "therefore we have studied the dependence of the wavefunctions and stability of the novel fqh states on the exact form of interaction at short range .",
    "we found several indications that the novel qe states are distinctly different from the electron states in ll@xmath23 : ( i ) the @xmath1 state appears incompressible only for the odd values of @xmath175 ; ( ii ) the pair - correlation functions @xmath155 ( and , especially , the triplet - correlation functions@xcite ) are quite different ; ( iii ) although they remain incompressible , the ground states appear to undergo phase transitions when the qe ",
    "qe pseudopotential is continuously transformed into that of electrons in ll@xmath23 ; ( iv ) the overlaps with the electron states in ll@xmath23 and with the moore  read trial state are very small . however , further studies are needed to understand these transitions . on the other hand , weak dependence of the wavefunctions and excitation gaps of the novel fqh states on the details of the qe ",
    "qe interaction ( as long as it remains strongly subharmonic at short range ) justifies the use of a model pseudopotential in the realistic numerical calculation .",
    "we have also explored halperin s idea@xcite of the formation of laughlin states of qe pairs ( qe@xmath156 s ) .",
    "an appropriate composite boson model has been formulated and shown to predict a family of novel fqh states at a series of fractions including all those observed in experiment .",
    "however , several observations strongly point against this simple model : ( i ) the qe@xmath156qe@xmath156 interaction pseudopotential is not superharmonic to support laughlin correlations of qe@xmath156 s ( except possibly for @xmath1 ) ; ( ii ) the values of @xmath33 predicted for finite @xmath32 are different from these obtained from the numerical diagonalization ( except for @xmath1 ) ; ( iii ) the numerical results do not confirm the significance of parity of the number of qe s in finite systems ( the @xmath1 states occur only for @xmath325 , 10 , and 14 , and the @xmath38 states occur for both even and odd values of @xmath32 ) ; ( iv ) the analysis of three - body correlations suggests formation of clusters larger than pairs.@xcite in fact , despite an earlier expectation,@xcite we find @xcite that halperin s pairing idea is far more appropriate for the electrons in ll@xmath23 than for qe s in cf - ll@xmath23 .",
    "we have not found evidence for only partial pairing ( and possibly laughlin - correlated mixed states of pairs and unpaired electrons ) or grouping of qe s into larger clusters of well - defined size ( and possibly laughlin correlations between them@xcite ) .",
    "however , further investigation of both these ideas is necessary .",
    "also , since the experiment@xcite indicates complete spin polarization of the novel fqh states , here we have not studied unpolarized systems , considered in great detail in a number of earlier studies begun with the work of park and jain.@xcite finally , the connection between the qe pairing studied here and recent shot - noise experiments@xcite indicating bunching of qp s in laughlin and jain fqh states at ultra - low temperatures is not yet clear .",
