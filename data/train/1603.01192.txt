    "the study of degenerate plasma is important due to its applications e.g. to strong laser produced plasmas @xcite , high density astrophysical plasmas such as in white dwarfs or neutron stars @xcite , or large density electronic devices ( as in the drain region of @xmath0 diodes @xcite ) . in plasmas ,",
    "the quantum effects are more relevant for electrons rather than ions because of their lower mass .",
    "the quantum nature of the charge carriers manifests with the inclusion of both pauli exclusion principle for fermions and heisenberg uncertainty principle due to the wave like character of the particles .",
    "accordingly , electrons obey the fermi - dirac statistics and their equation of state is determined using the fermi - dirac distribution . on the other hand the quantum diffraction effects",
    "are usually modeled by means of quantum recoil terms in kinetic theory or the bohm potential in fluid theory , besides higher order gradient corrections @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the wave propagation in a degenerate plasma can be studied using at least two main approaches i.e. , kinetic and hydrodynamic models . in kinetic theory , the unperturbed electron distribution is frequently given by a fermi - dirac function , while in hydrodynamics the momentum equation for electrons is made consistent with the equation of state of a degenerate electron fermi gas @xcite .",
    "in fluid models , the ion - sound wave propagation in plasmas with degenerate electrons has been investigated by a number of authors @xcite , using the equation of state for a cold ( fully degenerate ) fermi electron gas , with a negligible thermodynamic temperature .",
    "the energy distribution of a degenerate electron gas described by the fermi - dirac distribution is characterized by independent parameters , one of which is the chemical potential , while the other is the thermodynamic temperature . on the other hand , the energy spread for the classical ideal electron gas obeying maxwell - boltzmann distribution",
    "is uniquely determined by the thermodynamic temperature .",
    "the equation of state for the fully degenerate electron gas so reduces to an one - parameter problem i.e. , the chemical potential .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study the linear and specially nonlinear wave propagation in the intermediate regime , depending on the competition between the two parameters i.e. , chemical potential and thermal temperature r11 , including quantum diffraction .",
    "our treatment is specially relevant to borderline systems with @xmath1 , which are neither strongly degenerate nor sufficiently well described by classical statistics , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are resp . the electron thermodynamic and fermi temperatures .",
    "a striking example is provided by inertial confinement fusion plasmas @xcite , with particle densities ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and thermodynamic temperatures above @xmath6 . during laser irradiation of the solid target ,",
    "quantum statistical effects tend to be more relevant immediately after compression , before the heating phase .",
    "moreover , laboratory simulation of astrophysical scenarios involving dense plasmas better fit the intermediate quantum - classical regime @xcite . for these reasons and potential applications on e.g. ultra - small semiconductor devices operating in a mixed dense - dilute regime @xcite , it is desirable to have a general macroscopic model covering both classical and quantum statistics , besides quantum diffraction .",

    "eliasson and shukla @xcite derived nonlinear quantum electron fluid equations by taking the moments of the evolution equation for the wigner function in terms of a local fermi - dirac equilibrium with an arbitrary thermodynamic temperature . in this model quantum diffraction manifest in terms of the bohm potential .",

    "@xcite investigated the nonlinear theory of ion - acoustic waves in isothermal plasmas with arbitrary degeneracy , but without including quantum recoil .",
    "they presented the equation of state for ions and electrons by considering them as warm ( @xmath7 ) fermi gases .",
    "the nonlinear analysis was done using a bernoulli pseudo - potential approach .",
    "the ranges of the phase velocities of the periodic ion - acoustic waves and the soliton velocity were investigated . however , for simplicity they ignored the quantum bohm potential , which increases the order of the resulting dynamical equations .",

    "ii , the basic set of hydrodynamic equations is proposed and the barotropic equation of state defined , for a general fermi - dirac equilibrium . in section iii , the linear dispersion relation for quantum ion - acoustic waves is derived , following the fluid model . comparison with known results from quantum kinetic theory allows to determine a fitting parameter in the quantum force , so that the macroscopic and microscopic approaches coincide in the long wavelength limit . in section",
    "iv , nonlinear wave structures are studied by means of the reductive perturbation method and the associated korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation .",

    "it is known that the qualitative role of the bohm potential is to provide extra dispersion .",
