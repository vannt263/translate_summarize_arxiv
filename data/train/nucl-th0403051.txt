    "even though quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the accepted theory of hadronic physics , realistic nonperturbative qcd predictions for reaction amplitudes are still not available .",
    "however , quantum hadrodynamic ( qhd ) calculations continue to provide a reasonable framework for the analysis of data .",
    "related , the historical success of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) and regge theory has led to an established legacy for investigating both electromagnetic and hadronic processes . because of the wide interest in the gluonic aspects of qcd , especially glueballs , and new experimental opportunities at electromagnetic accelerator facilities , such as jefferson lab , this work combines qhd , vmd and regge / pomeron physics to study double vector meson photoproduction , @xmath8 , mediated by a scalar glueball , @xmath1 .",
    "central to our formulation is the pomeron - glueball hypothesis ( pgh )  @xcite which connects the pomeron with the even signature @xmath9 @xmath10 glueball regge trajectory .",
    "indeed both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite evidence continues to accumulate which supports this conjecture .",
    "the pgh provides an attractive , logical framework for determining all glueball - hadron couplings from established pomeron phenomenology .    in this study",
    "we use the pgh to extend the effective lagrangian model developed for @xmath7 photoproduction  @xcite and time - like virtual compton scattering ( tvcs )  @xcite , to double vector meson photoproduction mediated by a scalar glueball .",
    "the necessary glueball - vector meson ( @xmath11 ) hadronic and electromagnetic couplings are uniquely determined from pgh , vmd and isospin symmetry ( flavor independence ) of the glueball - hadron couplings .",
    "in addition to cross sections , we predict the @xmath12 glueball partial decay widths for double vector , @xmath4 , one photon , @xmath13 , and two photon , @xmath14 , decay channels .",
    "since the vector meson leptonic decay constants are known , we also apply vmd to derive the radiative , @xmath6 , transition form factors required for scalar glueball electroproduction calculations .",
    "our key finding is the prediction of a measurable @xmath8 cross section and a glueball enhancement in the @xmath15 and @xmath3 invariant mass spectra near 1.7 gev .",
    "this paper spans six sections . in section",
    "ii we review the essential features of @xmath7 electromagnetic production and tvcs  @xcite that are relevant for formulating @xmath16 photoproduction .",
    "then we detail the qhd model in section iii and in section iv present the vmd relations , glueball radiative transition form factors and decay widths .",
    "section v contains our main results with theoretical @xmath17 cross sections documenting a measurable glueball enhancement and novel signature decay .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize and comment on future investigations .",
    "vector meson photoproduction is known to be dominated by diffractive scattering at low momentum transfer and high energy .",
    "the diffractive amplitude has a clear exponential @xmath18-dependence , presumably generated by a tower of gluon @xmath18-channel exchanges , collectively known as the pomeron  @xcite . at low energy and for large momentum transfer",
    ", vector meson photoproduction is complicated by non - diffractive mechanisms such as pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath19 ) exchange  @xcite , nucleon resonances and two - gluon exchange  @xcite .    in @xmath7 photoproduction",
    "there are additional non - diffractive amplitudes due to strangeness knockout  @xcite and okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi )  @xcite violating / evading @xmath20 couplings  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 photoproduction reaction is especially interesting for probing the intrinsic strangeness content of the nucleon  @xcite and yields important constraints for the ( off - shell ) nucleon form factors in the vector meson resonance region accessible in tvcs , @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "for example , ozi evading @xmath20 vector and tensor couplings contribute to the nucleon strangeness radius , strange magnetic moment and provide an improved description of the neutron electric form factor , @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "our previous results documented that precision @xmath7 photoproduction and di - lepton tvcs data near the @xmath7 production threshold will provide important constraints for disentangling the complicated diffractive / non - diffractive amplitude components . in this work we apply the same effective lagrangian used to calculate @xmath18-channel pomeron exchange in @xmath23 , to scalar glueball photoproduction @xmath8 .",
    "an important feature in the photoproduction / tvcs model is the photon - pomeron - vector meson vertex coupling associated with the @xmath18-channel pomeron exchange .",
    "again we utilize this and now interchange the role of the pomeron and vector meson to consider @xmath18-channel @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath7 exchange leading to pomeron , or via the pgh , glueball photoproduction .",
    "we also interpret the scalar glueball as the @xmath26 physical state on the daughter pomeron trajectory .",
    "we formulate the double vector meson photoproduction reaction as a two step mechanism mediated by a scalar glueball , @xmath1 @xmath27 where the energy - momentum 4-vectors ( helicities ) for the photon , proton , glueball , recoil proton and vector mesons are given by @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the general case is considered involving photoproduction of a glueball that may be on , @xmath37 , or off - shell ( virtual ) , @xmath38 , and decays into two , possibly different , vector mesons @xmath39 , @xmath3 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 having masses @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "the effective glueball propagator is a generalization of the empiracle space - like pomeron prescription  @xcite with the pole mass fixed at @xmath58 gev , consistent with the generally accepted lightest scalar glueball .",

    "the hadronic form factor , @xmath105 , incorporates the composite nucleon and vector meson structure which can be calculated in constituent quark models and is important for regulating the energy and momentum transfer dependence in meson photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "however , to preserve the covariance and crossing properties of our model , we employ the phenomenological form factor  @xcite @xmath106 normalized to unity at @xmath107 . fitting the @xmath108 data yields the optimum cut - off parameter @xmath109 gev .",
    "also note that , unlike vector meson electromagnetic production , for @xmath18-channel @xmath110 glueball ( pomeron ) production , pseudoscalar meson exchange is prohibited by @xmath111-parity conservation .",
    "hence @xmath112 exchange only contributes to the production of @xmath111 = odd glueball states which have much higher masses and are also more difficult to detect .    in the @xmath73 and @xmath113-channels",
    ", the highly virtual proton propagation requires an off - shell form factor prescription .",
    "because the @xmath73 and @xmath113-channel diagrams must combine to produce a conserved hadronic current , we incorporate the off - shell effect as a self - energy correction .",
    "constrained by gauge invariance and the proton mass , the self - energy function must vanish at the proton pole and also be an odd function of @xmath114 .",

    "the model parameters for the pomeron amplitude are listed in table i and the vector meson coupling constants are specified in table ii .",

    "indeed there are several other decay channels involving lighter mesons ( @xmath112 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) which will compete and ref .",
    "@xcite estimates the total width could be up to 250 mev .",
    "the actual width is between these two limits and probably closer to the observed widths for the @xmath127 and @xmath128 glueball candidates which are 109 and 125 mev , respectively .",
    "finally , glueball electroproduction via intermediate virtual photons will require form factors for the transition @xmath6 .",
    "again , simple application of vmd yields the appropriate @xmath6 transition form factors @xmath129",
    "this section summarizes the key cross section findings and presents results for a variety of kinematics .",
    "figure 1 displays the exclusive photoproduction cross section versus the @xmath16 invariant mass .",
    "the three solid curves , corresponding to different glueball widths , represent production and decay to the @xmath130 or @xmath131 final states . because of universality ( @xmath132 ) and the near degeneracy of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 masses , the @xmath15 and @xmath3 production cross sections are essentially equal so one curve represents both channels .",
    "the two short dashed curves are for @xmath40 production which has a higher threshold .",
    "the long dashed curve is the non - regge prediction using @xmath133 79 mev .",
    "this is the result using the gluonic propagator without the regge factor and , as discussed previously , can be regarded as production mediated by more conventional hadron ( glueball ) formation .",
    "notice that it is about a factor of 4 larger than the regge ( pomeron ) prediction using the same width ( top solid line ) .",
    "a similar increase occurs for the two other widths ( not shown ) .",
    "= 3.5 in = 4 in    = 3.5 in = 4 in    = 3.5 in = 4 in    to document sensitivity to the uncertain glueball width , three values are displayed .",
    "the upper solid curve depicting the distinct resonant glueball structure assumes that vector meson decay saturates the entire glueball width and uses the value @xmath134 79 mev from table iv .",
    "the lower curve corresponds to a width of 238 mev which is taken as an upper bound and is also the numerical width necessary to completely suppress the glueball cross section enhancement .",
    "the middle curve uses @xmath135 mev which , as discussed in section iv , is probably closer to the physical glueball value .",
    "hence , if the actual width is roughly of order 100 mev , a clear glueball enhancement can emerge .    the two dashed @xmath40 production curves , corresponding to the minimum and maximum glueball widths",
    ", are essentially the same since the @xmath136 threshold is well above the on - shell glueball mass ( @xmath58 gev ) and only a small effect is present from the off - shell gluonic propagator .",
    "consequently @xmath40 production is predicted to be devoid of a light scalar glueball enhancement .",
    "this is also why the @xmath15 ( or @xmath3 ) curves converge at higher invariant @xmath16 mass , a region of interests for effects from a tensor , @xmath137 , glueball that is expected to have mass near 2 gev . related , ref .",
    "@xcite lists several @xmath138 , possible glueball , states above 2 gev with observed @xmath136 decays .",
    "the cross section kinematics reflect the capability of the envsioned hall d facility at jefferson lab . depending on choice of gluonic propagator",
    ", there is sensitivity to the incident photon energy as indicated in fig .",
    "while the energy behavior of the non - regge prediction ( dashed line ) is relatively flat , the regge calculation ( solid curve ) increases with higher beam energy .",
    "there is little energy or @xmath73 dependence in the non - regge calculation since the cross section is at forward angles ( @xmath18-channel dominated ) . because the regge formulation is more phenomenologically based , it is our preferred prediction .",
    "however , it would be interesting to confront both results with multiple vector meson production data at low and high energies .",
    "interestingly , the two formulations yield similar cross sections ( and measurable production rates ) near 7 gev which is a frequently cited jlab upgraded photon energy . hence it should be feasible to confirm the gluonic enhancement predicted in fig . 1 .",
    "there is significant sensitivity to the production final state angle , @xmath139 , or momentum transfer .",
    "this is reflected in fig .",
    "3 which details a falling , then rising cross section with increasing angle . note the minimum cross section occurs for @xmath139 = @xmath140 .",
    "this prediction is for @xmath141 6.0 gev and corresponds to the intermediate , more representative glueball width .",
    "as expected for small angles ( low @xmath18 ) @xmath18-channel vector meson exchange dominates with @xmath24 exchange ( dense dot curve ) being the most important . at larger angles ( higher @xmath18 ) @xmath73 and @xmath113-channel amplitudes emerge ( dashed curve ) corresponding to production from glueball - proton coupling . because both @xmath73 and @xmath142 are fixed , the regge and non - regge ( not shown ) results have identical @xmath18-channel relative contributions and variations .    it is important to relate these predictions to the expected background @xmath16 production from non - glueball mediated processes . unfortunately , to our knowledge there are no specific model calculations in this energy region . however , other double meson photoproduction calculations exist and refs .",
    "@xcite predict cross sections comparable in magnitude to those calculated here .",
    "further , ref .",
    "@xcite investigates possible exotic , @xmath143 , meson excitation in @xmath144 and predicts a similar resonance profile to our glueball production result .    finally , we note a novel detection signature predicted by this analysis . because of the dominant @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 decays , the presence of a glueball excitation should be correlated with a 4 and 6 @xmath112 decay around 1.7 gev in the invariant @xmath15 and @xmath3 mass spectra , respectively .",
    "further , and depending on the proximity of the glueball mass to the @xmath41 threshold , there also may be a @xmath148 decay near or above 1.8 gev in the @xmath41 spectrum .",
    "the latter may be a unique signature as there are no hadrons listed with this decay .",
    "this would be an ideal experiment for the envisioned hall d large acceptance spectrometer .",
    "this work combines the time - honored tools of quantum hadrodynamics , vector meson dominance and regge theory with the pomeron - glueball connection hypothesis to predict glueball production and decay processes . using a minimal set of parameters independently determined from recent hadronic and electromagnetic analyses ,",
    "a measurable cross section is predicted for @xmath149 .",
    "most significant is a possible scalar glueball enhancement near 1.7 gev in the @xmath15 and @xmath3 invariant mass spectra .",
    "this resonant cross section structure is sensitive to the total glueball width and should be discernable if the width is of order 100 mev .",
    "if the actual width is significantly larger , say greater than 200 mev , it may still be possible to detect a scalar glueball via decay to either 4 or 6 pions having an invariant mass near 1.7 gev .",
    "even more novel would be a correlated @xmath150 observation in this same mass region , which would be a unique decay signature from a scalar hadron .",
    "such measurements would be ideal for the envsioned jlab energy upgrade and new hall d wide acceptance spectrometer .",
    "future work will address other scalar glueball decay channels .",
    "related , tensor glueball production and decay will be investigated which will be especially interesting since the @xmath151 glueball mass is expected to be above the clear signature @xmath40 decay threshold .",
