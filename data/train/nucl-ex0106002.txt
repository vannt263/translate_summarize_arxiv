    ", we shall develop a simple time dependent formalism leading to scintillation efficiency expressions which , up to a supplementary nuclear quenching term , reduces in the first order approximation , to relations very similar to equations ( [ ecu6 ] ) , ( [ ecu8 ] ) , when integrated over time .",

    "experimental observations related to the scintillation and its behaviour as a function of temperature in both pure csi and activated csi(tl ) crystals can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the thallium concentration dependence is regarded too . at room temperature , the emission spectrum of a csi(tl ) excited by charged projectiles @xcite",
    "is dominated by a broad yellow band , centered near 550  nm .",
    "this band is thus associated with emission from tl luminescence centres and is referred to as the tl band @xcite .",
    "the yellow band nearly completely replaces the competing blue band , related to @xmath123 vacancies or elementary colour centres @xcite and the ultraviolet ( uv ) band , considered as an intrinsic property of a perfect crystal @xcite .",

    "a ) the scintillation efficiency is non - linearly increasing with the increasing energy of the particle . for different ions at the same energy , the scintillation efficiency decreases with increasing specific electronic stopping power  @xcite .",
    "if the ionizing particle is an electron or a @xmath124  ray of energy higher than 100 kev , the light output may be considered to a good approximation as a linear function of energy  @xcite .",

    "rays @xcite , which affects the monotonic behaviour resulting from the previous item .",
    "c ) combined studies of light efficiency and scintillator decay - constant versus temperature @xcite have indicated that the quenching effect is external to the luminescence centre @xcite .      an ionizing particle excites the scintillator crystal along its path by creating carriers : electrons , promoted in the conduction band , and associated holes in the valence band .",
    "csi(tl ) is an insulator and the energy gap between these two bands is of the order of the mean ionization energy @xmath125 ev @xcite .",
    "thallium iodide is melted with the caesium iodide host bulk before the crystal growth @xcite .",
    "some cation sites are occupied by tl@xmath126 ions having lost one valence electron in favour of i@xmath127 anions . as in the case of kcl(tl ) @xcite , the excited energy levels of the tl@xmath126 ions are presumably localized in the forbidden band of the host lattice .",
    "even though deeper than in the semiconductor case , these levels may essentially participate in the ionized lattice deexcitation , provided that they are free .",
    "although the emission bands of the csi(tl ) scintillators , of which the most prevalent one is centred at about 550  nm ,   have been intensively studied , there is still controversial discussion about the origin of this band @xcite .",
    "thus , according to different interpretations , the luminescence emission may imply , for example , a single thallium centre @xcite , a couple of tl@xmath126 - @xmath128 centres @xcite or even more complex cluster configurations nearby a tl impurity @xcite . as definitions of the imperfection centres we use those in ref .",
    "most of the mentioned approaches converge towards two ideas : for the luminescence induced by highly ionizing particles , both type of carriers , electrons and holes , play a role in the emitted light , i.e. in the scintillation efficiency ; the radiative emission around 550  nm   takes place in the @xmath129 excited ions .",
    "let us imagine a formal , oversimplified scenario for the scintillation process , by exemplifying it on the latter luminescence centres .",
    "we suppose that the tl@xmath126 ion , with its 2 remaining valence electrons , superfluous in the ionic bond of the csi lattice , has a donor behaviour . stimulated by thermal vibrations , the tl@xmath126 ions are loosing , in part , some of the outer electrons , creating intruded levels into the upper part of the forbidden band . these double ionized thallium atoms tl@xmath130 would become electron traps of volume concentration @xmath82 .",
    "the remaining tl@xmath126 ions would be the hole traps , with the volume concentration @xmath131 .",
    "one could reason as following : in the highly ionized fiducial volume , the holes are mainly trapped , via a mechanism which is disregarded here , by tl@xmath126 ions becoming tl@xmath130 ions , while the electrons are mainly trapped on excited levels by such newly created double ionized thallium atoms or by previously existing ones due to thermal excitation .",
    "they form @xmath129 excited ions which decay afterwards by emitting the scintillation of energy @xmath73 , in the characteristic 550  nm   band ; here @xmath15 is the planck constant and @xmath132 is the light frequency .",
    "the scheme of the process is : @xmath133 the mathematical formalism is the same if a more complex configuration of the luminescence centre is considered . during the non - equilibrium state in the cylinder around the ionizing particle trajectory , the two states of thallium feed one another via the carrier trapping , closing in this way the cycle which insures the restoration of the equilibrium and the local electrical neutrality .",
    "a time dependent formalism which treats the kinetics of the volume concentrations for both types of carriers and thallium traps would somehow cover also the `` exciton '' scenario @xcite . in this way",
    ", it would not be necessary to isolate in time the two steps of the scintillation process : prompt formation of exciton and its delayed deexcitation .",
    "similarly to the levels created by thallium impurities , deeper levels may be intruded by other point defects of the crystal : the cations and anions removed towards interstitial positions , or for the pure alkali halides more probably to the crystal surface @xcite , and the associated vacancies .",
    "the positive and negative defects are produced by thermal vibrations in practically equal concentrations @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "these levels may compete with the activator sites in carrier trapping , following radiative transitions in the blue band or non - radiative transitions . in insulators ,",
    "the fermi - dirac statistics of the carrier states is well approximated by a boltzmann function .",
    "the concentration of those carriers located at the defect sites , together with the neutrality condition @xcite , provide the defect distribution , described by a boltzmann function too .",
    "the energy of a nearest - neighbour bound in a solid is of the order of 1 ev . actually , after kittel @xcite ,",
    "the cation and anion defect concentrations are @xmath134 , where @xmath22 is the host volume concentration of cations and anions and @xmath135ev is much larger than the mean vibrational energy .",
    "comparable values for @xmath74 ( 0.2 - 0.4 ev ) are obtained with the above expression from concentration of elementary colour centres of the order of 10@xmath31 - 10@xmath136 centres  @xmath19 , determined by means of absorption coefficients @xcite . in a boltzmann type distribution",
    ", @xmath75 would represent the number of cations or anions per unit volume having energies higher than @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , @xmath137 1 ev would be the minimum energy , transferred to a lattice ion , required to produce a defect . at a given temperature",
    ", the number of defects may be enhanced by the nuclear interaction of the incident particle with the lattice nuclei .",
    "this interaction is proportional to the specific nuclear stopping power @xmath138 and produces an additional defect concentration ( practically the same for cations and anions ) @xmath64 .",
    "besides , one has to consider the capture of electrons by the ionized atoms in the wake of the particles , i.e. the `` direct '' electron - hole recombination , leading to the crystal intrinsic transitions in the uv band .",
    "this process probability increases with the specific electronic stopping power @xmath139 of the incident particle , while it has to be practically null for electrons . in experiments ,",
    "a small uv peak was observed for the heaviest ions of low energy . on the contrary , for very energetic protons punching out through a thin csi(tl ) crystal , in such a way that the bragg peak is not contributing to the scintillation , both quantities @xmath140 and",
    "@xmath141 are so weak that the shape of their signal is nearly similar to that of electrons generated by @xmath124  rays .",
