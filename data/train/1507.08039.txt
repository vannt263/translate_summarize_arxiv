    "it is a well known fact in quantum field theory ( qft ) that any kind of unification of internal ( gauge ) symmetries with spacetime symmetries is not evident at all .",
    "the celebrated coleman - mandula theorem and its various versions @xcite prohibit the most simple unification scenarios : under quite generic conditions one can not find a larger symmetry group for a qft model , which is composed as the semi - direct product of the poincar group and the internal symmetry group .",
    "one of the important assumptions of the pertinent no - go theorem is that the lie group of internal symmetries is restricted to products of copies of @xmath0 group and compact semisimple lie groups .",
    "this means that the total symmetries of matter fields at a fixed spacetime point or equivalently , at a fixed point of momentum space is a product of copies of @xmath0 group and a semisimple lie group .",
    "our aim is to show a possible , physically natural mathematical example , when the total symmetry group of matter fields at a spacetime point or equivalently , at a fixed point of momentum space is some nontrivial extension of the ( conformal ) lorentz group , or more precisely , its covering group .",
    "the pertinent extended group can be viewed as the automorphisms of the creation operator algebra for a spin 1/2 particle along with its antiparticle .",
    "the non - semisimpleness of the discussed group gives possibility to nontrivially extend the group of spacetime symmetries .",
    "the extended part becomes an idempotent normal subgroup , which can be regarded as `` dressing transformations '' of pure one - particle states in a formal qft context at a fixed momentum .",
    "the presented algebraic construction may also help to improve mathematical formulation of qfts : it shows a possibility to avoid building the theory based on first constructing the one - particle theory and then constructing the corresponding multi - particle model , _ a posteriori_. that is because the `` dressing transformations '' mix the pure @xmath1-particle,@xmath2-antiparticle states with each - other to some extent , putting the possible particle combination states in a unified multiplet .",

    "on the other hand , the remaining normal subgroup can be thought of as `` dressing transformations '' making `` dressed '' states from pure one - particle states .",
    "the proposed construction may be used in construction of quantum field theories on a non - perturbative basis : our approach is different than that of usual approach when the one - particle theory is defined , and then a fock space of multiparticle states is built on top of that .",
    "in addition , a similar approach could be used in gut attempts , as it provides a possibility to circumvent coleman - mandula theorem : the non - semisimpleness of the pertinent symmetry group could allow to have the spacetime and internal symmetries to be connected via the non - semisimple part , without introducing susy .",
    "an interesting idea would be to study these results in the light of @xcite , which provides an @xmath185 unification attempt , also using an algebra automorphism group .",
