    "this result is consistent with expectations from semianalytic theory and results from large cosmological @xmath74-body simulations .",
    "the steep evolution of the merger rate @xmath96 directly implies that for a wide range of physical bh feeding mechanisms with duration @xmath22 , the duty cycle @xmath166 increases with redshift . while @xmath22 can in general depend on a myriad factors , i took advantage of the fact that the halos of interest here share closely similar assembly histories to conjecture that the feeding times for these halos can be characterized as a function of redshift with a reasonably small scatter .",
    "the formation of the @xmath3 quasar smbhs can be explained without super - eddington accretion , for both popiii and direct collapse seed models , if @xmath22 is greater than several @xmath151 at @xmath18 and scales with redshift as @xmath133 with @xmath167 , for scatter in @xmath22 of @xmath168 dex .",
    "this parameter space includes @xmath169^{-3/2 } { \\;\\mathrm{myr}}$ ] .",
    "this finding suggests that the smbh growth scenario suggested by li et al .",
    "@xcite may be viable for a plurality of all dark matter halos at this mass scale that host a nuclear bh .",
    "3 .   the main progenitors of the @xmath3 quasar hosts become molecular - cooling ( atomic - cooling ) very early , at @xmath170 ( @xmath50 ) , significantly earlier than halos in detailed cosmological simulations that focus on the formation of typical first stars and galaxies , at @xmath171 ( @xmath142 ) . such simulations may not be well - suited for studying the the evolution of the @xmath3 quasar smbhs , as they would underestimate the effects of halo growth and mergers , especially for popiii seed models .    when considering the origins of the @xmath3 quasar smbhs ,",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the observed properties of @xmath12 _ galaxies _ are remarkably similar to what is found at later cosmological epochs : their masses are comparable to ( but somewhat lower than ) those of the most massive smbhs and galaxies in the local universe ; the quasar spectra and metallicities appear identical to what is found at lower redshifts @xcite ; they exhibit strong star formation @xcite and winds @xcite associated with post - merger quasar activity . in a similar vein ,",
    "massive galaxies at @xmath172 appear to already have metal - enriched stellar populations with ages of @xmath173 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the masses of both the @xmath3 quasar smbhs and their hosts are comparable to the largest masses of smbhs and galaxies found at lower redshifts . indeed , the simple expectation from the theory of hierarchical structure formation is that the abundance of galaxies approaching the mass ceiling of galaxies @xcite reaches @xmath140 by @xmath3 .",
    "that is , the observation of smbhs at the highest mass scales at @xmath3 is coincident with the emergence of the most massive class of galaxies  expected from theory , and observed to be fully evolved",
    ". it also follows from theory that after their relatively early arrival on the cosmic stage , the population of massive galaxies should evolve increasingly slowly as the universe ages  at the largest masses due to the inhibition of gas cooling , and in general due to the precipitous drop in the frequency of major mergers ( the triggers of starbursts and smbh growth ) toward low redshifts .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with observed trends in the emergence and growth of the most massive smbhs and galaxies throughout cosmic time @xcite .",
    "one then wonders : aside from their early formation , what is extraordinary about the @xmath3 quasars and their hosts ? that their hosts are more compact , gas - rich and rapidly merging despite having similar masses to their low - redshift counterparts may result in their bhs having somewhat larger eddington ratios @xcite and being heavily obscured for large periods of time ( in addition to their being possibly obscured at birth @xcite ) .",
    "the latter possibility could negatively affect the detectability of @xmath174 quasars by the james webb space telescope and athena+ at rest - frame uv and x - ray frequencies , respectively , while making large contributions to the cosmic infrared background ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correlations between smbhs and galaxy properties could differ from what is found in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , depending on the details of the seeding and growth mechanisms @xcite .    the formation and evolution of low - mass galaxies and their nuclear bhs may have proceeded quite differently at high redshifts , as gas cooling in small ( proto- ) galaxies is known to be more sensitive to the temperature and ionization state of the inter- and circumgalactic media .",
    "the transition of the igm from neutral @xmath175 gas at @xmath176 , to ionized gas with temperatures comparable to protogalactic virial temperatures and the atomic - cooling threshold at @xmath177 , would have affected star formation and bh growth in low - mass galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hosts of the @xmath3 smbhs were likely to be the least affected by this upheaval of the intergalactic environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a minimalistic , zeroth - order ansatz would be that once their immediate environments are ionized and provided that they are above the cosmological jeans ( filtering ) mass scale , the formation and evolution of galaxies  smbhs , metallicities , winds and all  are driven primarily by the gravitational environment of their dark matter halos , at high and low redshift ; that while the earliest galaxies and smbhs at the largest mass scales arise and evolve rapidly , they do so without processes that are either rare or absent ( e.g. highly super - eddington accretion ) in galaxies of similar mass at lower redshift . or , we can turn this ansatz into a question : is there a redshift above which the evolution of massive galaxies and their smbhs is qualitatively different from what is observed at @xmath14 ? just as turner ( 1991 ) @xcite noted for @xmath178 quasars , the formation of the @xmath3 quasars could be explained within the confines of ` conventional cosmic structure formation .
