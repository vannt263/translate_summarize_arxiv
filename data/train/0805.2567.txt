    "the hr diagram is the most important map of stellar astronomy .",
    "it provides a relatively straightforward method for separating different stellar luminosity classes , e.g.  supergiants , bright giants , giants , subgiants , main sequence dwarfs , and white dwarfs , using their colors and luminosities .",
    "however , spectroscopic and trigonometric parallax results have revealed a seventh distinct stellar luminosity class  the subdwarfs  that lie below the main sequence dwarfs on the hr diagram .",
    "the realm of the subdwarfs has been previously explored by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , to name a few .",
    "subdwarfs locations on the hr diagram are in part due to having metallicity abundances lower than most field stars , which causes their opacities to differ from those of regular dwarfs .",
    "subdwarfs are sometimes called low metallicity halo stars or galactic thick disk stars based on their spectroscopic features , kinematics , and/or ages @xcite . regardless of how they are described ,",
    "subdwarfs are fundamentally different from their main sequence cousins .    because of their generally high intrinsic velocities in the galaxy",
    ", many subdwarfs have been selected using high proper motion efforts , such as the lowell proper motion ( @xcite ) , lhs ( @xcite ) , and lpine - shara proper motion - north ( lspm , @xcite ) catalogs .",
    "recently , subdwarfs have been selected by colors and spectroscopic observations via the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) .",
    "after initial flagging as a potential subdwarf , spectroscopic and astrometric ( i.e.  trigonometric parallax work ) followup efforts are typically carried out to confirm or refute candidates as true subdwarfs .",
    "past subdwarf identification efforts include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of these studies confirmed subdwarfs spectroscopically , but only @xcite provides the crucial trigonometric parallaxes that allow subdwarfs to be placed on the hr diagram .",
    "@xcite presented a pioneering effort to assign numeric subtypes for cool subdwarfs of spectral types k and m. first , he used the flux ratio of molecular band features , cahn ( n @xmath0 13 ; we will use `` cah '' to indicate all three bands or index values throughout this paper , unless otherwise specified ) and tio5 with pseudo - continuum points to calculate spectroscopic indices ( @xmath1/@xmath2 ) . on tio5 vs cah1 or tio5 vs cah2@xmath3cah3 plots , two high order polynomial lines can be used to separate a continuous distribution of stars into three categories : regular dwarfs , subdwarfs , and extreme subdwarfs .",
    "numerical subclasses were then assigned using two independent linear fits for subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs .",
    "for a decade , this methodology has been used to assign spectral types for cool subdwarfs .",
    "however , the current method of assigning subdwarf spectral types is not directly linked to either their main sequence or giant counterparts , as is typically ( but not always ) the case with normal dwarfs and giants .",
    "in addition , we have found that many subdwarfs are assigned different subtypes even though their differences are limited to cah .",
    "if these limitations can be overcome , a well - defined spectral sequence would benefit many research areas beyond classification efforts , including attempts to estimate effective temperatures and distances , as well as providing insight into understanding galactic structure .    in this work , we first provide clarification and recommendations for subdwarf terminology by addressing the usage of the confusing spectral prefix `` sd '' .",
    "we then discuss our spectroscopic observations of 88 subdwarfs , generally targeting high proper motion stars in the southern sky .",
    "we next outline how synthetic spectra can assist us in understanding cool subdwarf spectral features .",
    "the bulk of this work describes a detailed effort to provide a subdwarf spectral sequence for stars having spectral types k3.0 through m6.0 .",
    "we then apply this spectral typing method to those subdwarfs found in the sdss database .",
    "once we have a detailed understanding of what makes a star a subdwarf , we then discuss ( 1 ) why it is premature to assign precise parameters to subdwarf spectra , ( 2 ) misunderstandings related to the terms `` extreme '' and `` ultra '' subdwarfs , ( 3 ) why the old method works for dwarfs , but not subdwarfs , and finally ( 4 ) the recent set of subdwarf spectral standards from @xcite .",
    "the first subluminous objects fainter than main sequence stars were reported by @xcite when they were trying to determine the luminosities of a - type stars . in @xcite",
    "they called these stars `` intermediate white dwarfs '' to separate them from typical white dwarfs , and in the same paper reported the first six `` intermediate white dwarfs ''  now known as lhs 405 ( sdf3 ) , lhs 540 ( f8iv ) , lhs 1501 ( a4p ) , lhs 2194 ( sdf5 ) , hd 132475 ( f5/f6v ) , and hip 68321 ( a4 ) .",
    "all six have either a or f types ( spectral types are from simbad ) in the modern mk spectral classification system .",
    "however , the term `` subdwarfs '' was not suggested until @xcite .",
    "he expected three classes of objects to be found in his spectroscopic survey of high proper motion stars white dwarfs , stars of large spectroscopic parallaxes , and a class that was 2 or 3 magnitudes less luminous than main sequence stars of the same color less than 474 km / sec . under this assumption , he could then make crude estimates of their absolute magnitudes without having trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the results placed some stars three magnitudes below the main sequence . ] .",
    "he suggested the name `` subdwarfs '' be used to represent this final , independent , class of stars .",
    "this name paralleled the use of the term `` subgiants '' to describe stars that fall below the giants on the hr diagram .",
    "the name also eliminated the confusion with white dwarfs , which are much less luminous than main sequence stars ( and we now know are a completely different type of object ) .",
    "a year later , @xcite reported the first three m - type subdwarfs  kapteyn s star , lhs 20 , and lhs 64 ( @xcite confirmed that all are m subdwarfs ) .",
    "although they were termed subdwarfs , he used the same spectral classification as dwarfs ( m0 and m2 , see @xcite table 1 ) .",
    "the `` sd '' spectral classification prefix for subdwarfs did not appear until @xcite , when he used the strengthening of the lindblad depression around 4226 .    in the late 1940",
    "s through 60 s , the term `` subdwarfs '' also began being used for a class of underluminous blue stars @xcite .",
    "the terminology was based on the understanding that if these were high luminosity blue stars , their distances would be outside the milky way , so it was surmised that these stars should be underluminous , and therefore closer .",
    "although their temperatures are similar to o and b dwarfs , their spectral features are , in fact , quite different .",
    "generally , o - type subdwarfs ( sdo ) and b - type subdwarfs ( sdb ) both have broad balmer absorption .",
    "sdbs have weak or no he lines , while sdos have strong he ii ( 4686 ) or other he ii lines @xcite . since @xcite , such blue objects have been called sdo , sdb , or sdob - type stars .    thus , we are left with the unfortunate situation that there are two different classes of stars called `` subdwarfs . ''",
    "one is located at the cool end of the hr diagram while the other is at the hot end .",
    "the two classes of stars are subluminous for completely different astrophysical reasons but share the same `` sd '' spectral classification prefix .",
    "cool subdwarfs usually have low metallicity @xcite , so their opacties are different from dwarfs . for example , @xcite discussed the possible opacity sources for a solar type dwarf and a [ m / h]=@xmath42.5 subdwarfs .",
    "tio dominates the opacity sources in the optical band .",
    "however , because of a decreasing metallicity for subdwarfs , tio opacity decreases dramatically .",
    "hence , this less blanketing from tio bands causes more continuum flux radiated from deeper and hotter layer of stellar atmosphere and their spectrum falls closer overall to that of a blackbody , so these subdwarfs appear bluer than dwarfs , as shown in figure  [ fig.continuum.model ] . to the contrary , hot blue subdwarfs of types o and b are progenitors of white dwarfs , and their subluminous nature is not caused by metallicity at all . instead ,",
    "hot subdwarfs represent a stage in the stellar evolution cycle of an evolved star , and they happen to be crossing the main sequence at the moment of observation .",
    "because they _ are _ different kinds of stellar objects , we suggest that the two classes should not share the same spectral classification notation , `` sd . ''",
    "@xcite argued that for types later than g0 , the spectral notation `` vi '' should be used for stars that are @xmath512 magnitude less luminous than main sequence stars .",
    "although @xcite stated that `` this designation ( vi ) should definitely be abandoned '' , no specific reasons were actually given .",
    "here we propose that the luminosity class `` vi '' should be adopted for cool subdwarfs , especially for k and m types .",
    "the three primary reasons are :    * cool subdwarfs of types k and m lie clearly below main sequence stars on the hr diagram , forming an additional class of objects . assigning their types as vi continues the progression outlined by other classes . like the family of giants , which includes luminous supergiants ( i ) , bright giants ( ii ) , normal giants ( iii ) , and subgiants ( iv ) ,",
    "the family of dwarfs includes main sequence dwarfs ( v ) and their subdwarf ( vi ) counterparts .",
    "* cool subdwarfs and ob subdwarfs are completely differently types of objects with different origins .",
    "the notation `` sd '' is suitable for ob subdwarfs , which have not yet as a group been established to have any sort of sequence on the hr diagram , at least when using using parallaxes from the yale parallax catalog , hipparcos , and more recent efforts . on the other hand , there are dozens of cool subdwarfs with parallax measurements , and they do form a coherent group below the main sequence on the hr diagram , making a roman numeral designation reasonable . * historically , the roman numerals used for luminosity categorization track with different gravities for the stars classified , with higher gravities being assigned higher roman numerals .",
    "we find that assigning `` vi '' for subdwarfs appropriately continues this trend .",
    "figure  [ fig.lopez.morales ] shows the mass - gravity relation using data from table 1 of @xcite . in the best represented mass regime from 0.35@xmath6 to 0.70@xmath6",
    ", a crude trend indicates that lower metallicity stars do indeed have higher gravities .",
    "although much more data are needed to understand clearly how metallicity affects the mass - gravity relation , current evidence supports using the `` vi '' designation for low metallicity subdwarfs , which tend to exhibit higher gravities .",
    "thus , in order to separate the ob subdwarfs from the cool subdwarfs , we suggest the ` sd' prefix should not be used for low metallicity ( and/or high gravity , as will be shown below ) subdwarfs .",
    "our subdwarf targets were selected from several different efforts , including lists of spectroscopically identified subdwarfs @xcite , subdwarfs with parallax measurements @xcite , candidates from proper motion catalogs @xcite , and stars with metallicity measurements @xcite .",
    "we define our subdwarfs of interest to be those with @xmath7 2.0 , [ m / h ] @xmath80.5 , or having absolute magnitudes at least one magnitude less luminous in @xmath9 than a fit to main sequence stars of comparable color with trigonometric parallaxes from the recons ( research consortium on nearby stars ) 10 pc sample @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made with the 1.5-m and 4.0-m telescopes at ctio .",
    "for the observations on the 1.5-m from 2002 to 2006 , the r - c spectrograph with a loral 1200@xmath10800 ccd camera was used with the # 32 grating ( in first order ) at tilt 15.1@xmath11 .",
    "the order - blocking filter og570 was utilized to provide spectra covering the range of 6000  to 9500  with a resolution of 8.6 .",
    "the only variation in observing parameters was that during the may and december 2006 observing runs a larger slit width of 6  and 4 , respectively ,  was used instead of the 2  slit used in previous runs , in order to minimize the differential color refraction ( because the slit orientation was not changed during observations ) . for observations on the 4.0-m in 2002 , the r - c spectrograph with a loral 3k@xmath101k ccd was used with the # 181 grating ( in first order ) at tilt 58.8@xmath11 .",
    "the order - blocking filter og515 was utilized to provide spectra covering the range from 5500  to 10000  with a resolution of 6 .",
    "fringing at wavelengths longer than @xmath57000  in the 4.0-m data was removed by customized idl routines .",
    "bias frames and dome flats ( and sky flats at the 1.5-m ) were taken at the beginning of each night for calibration .",
    "at least two exposures were taken for each object to permit cosmic ray rejection .",
    "if stars were faint , additional observations were sometimes made .",
    "a 10 second ne@xmath3he@xmath3ar or ne only arc lamp spectrum was recorded after each target to permit wavelength calibration .",
    "several spectroscopic flux standard stars found in the @xmath12 spectroscopy reduction packages were observed during each observing run , usually nightly .",
    "reductions were carried out in the standard way using iraf reduction packages .",
    "wavelength and flux calibrations were done using _",
    "onedspec.dispcor _ and _ onedspec.calibrate _ within iraf , respectively .",
    "many of the subdwarfs discussed in this paper have new trigonometric parallaxes and @xmath13 photometry acquired during our southern nearby star program , ctiopi ( cerro tololo inter - american observatory parallax investigation , see @xcite ) . in a future paper in this subdwarf series",
    ", we will present the astrometric ( particularly trigonometric parallaxes ) and photometric results .      during our five year spectroscopic campaign",
    ", we have acquired spectra for more than 900 objects .",
    "to glean subdwarfs from our spectroscopic database , we calculated their spectroscopic indices listed in table  [ tbl.cahn.tio5.index ] ( targets listed alphabetically ) , mimicking the methodology outlined by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig.cahn.plot ] shows tio5 plotted against cah1 and cah2@xmath3cah3 for various samples of stars .",
    "our subdwarfs are shown with solid circles .",
    "for comparison , small dots indicate main sequence stars from @xcite , while open triangles and squares represent subdwarfs and `` extreme '' subdwarfs from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some stars ( solid circles ) having indices located near or in the main sequence regions in these plots have been manually checked to confirm that they are subdwarfs . using the hr diagram in figure  [ fig.hr.plot ]",
    ", we confirm the low luminosities of our spectroscopically selected subdwarfs ( @xmath14 2.7 ) that have accurate trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "although we focus primarily on the k and m subdwarfs for this study , we include a few g - type subdwarfs among those selected from metallicity measurements in the literature . for reference ,",
    "we consider early k - type stars to have types k0 to k2 , mid k - types to be k3 to k5 , and late k - types to be k6 and later .",
    "we find that it is difficult , but possible , to separate late g from early k - type stars using our spectral coverage and resolution .",
    "their continuum slopes have only slight differences across our wavelength window coverage , and there are no noticeable absorption differences beyond 7500 .",
    "spectra for g1v to k5v types from @xcite ( resolution @xmath54 ) and @xcite ( resolution @xmath511 ) are plotted in figure  [ fig.jacoby.silva ] .",
    "the only strong features are the absorption lines of ba i ( 6497 ) and h@xmath15 ( 6563 ) , with gradually increasing ba i absorption and decreasing h@xmath15 absorption as the effective temperature drops .",
    "these effects can be seen in both sequences , regardless of the spectral resolution .",
    "our spectral resolution of 69  falls between the resolution of the two sequences shown , so we can use the relative absorption strengths of ba i and h@xmath15 to separate g and k - type stars . in total , we have identified 88 k and m subdwarfs and five g type subdwarfs , using spectra with coverage from 6000  to 9000 .",
    "after reduction , the spectra were sorted into different bins based upon similarity in overall slope and features .",
    "this assured that stars in each bin had approximately the same temperature .",
    "however , several impediments to clean sorting were encountered :    * all mid k - type subdwarfs had spectra virtually indistinguishable from dwarf standard stars , yet they had low metallicity measurements and/or were found below the main sequence on the hr diagram ( see top figure in figure  [ fig.problem.spect ] ) .",
    "* many subdwarf spectra placed into the same bin showed differences only in cah ( see middle figure in figure  [ fig.problem.spect ] ) . * many subdwarf spectra matched different dwarf standards at the blue ( @xmath16 @xmath17 7570 ) and red ( @xmath16 @xmath18 8200 ) ends ( see bottom figure in figure  [ fig.problem.spect ] ) .",
    "in order to understand what factors caused these anomalies , we next examine theoretical studies that provide synthetic spectra that can be compared directly to the observed spectra .",
    "we use grids of synthetic spectra computed with phoenix codes ( hereafter , gaia model grids ) to understand how subdwarfs physical parameters ( temperature , metallicity and gravity ) affect their spectra .",
    "the most recently released gaia model grids @xcite are available at an ftp site in hamburg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have all used these synthetic model grids to characterize subdwarfs , but an older version of the grids was used in all three cases .",
    "the version we employ here , 2.6.1 , was released in late 2004 .",
    "a comparison of one pre-2004 spectral model ( provided by v. woolf , private communication ) and a new spectral model ( from the gaia model grids ) for a cool subdwarf is shown in figure  [ fig.new.old ] .",
    "improvements to the new models include ( 1 ) an enlarged and enhanced version of the equation of state , ( 2 ) more atomic , ionic , and molecular line opacities , ( 3 ) inclusion of the formation of dust particles for cool stars , and ( 4 ) microturbulence calculations .",
    "additional water and tio opacities and the inclusion of dust are enhancements particularly applicable to the low mass stars discussed here .",
    "the two spectra shown in figure  [ fig.new.old ] are virtually identical redward of 7000 , but there are significant differences between 6500  and 7000 , where the cah2 and cah3 bands are found , and these differences will certainly affect evaluations done with the older models .",
    "the new model in this region has much shallower absorptions than the old one , which will affect metallicity and gravity estimates .",
    "a few narrow absorption features ( li i at 6103 , ca i at 6122  and 6162 ) are also changed . as outlined in the discussion section @xmath19[sec : discussion ] , even the latest version of the model grids does not provide ideal matches to real spectra , so further progress can still be made .",
    "we use the latest gaia model grids - elements ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ti ) , which yield abundance ratios such as o / fe , ne / fe , etc .",
    "@xcite showed that most field halo stars have [ @xmath15/fe]@xmath20@xmath21[@xmath15/fe]@xmath22 , so we select [ @xmath15/@xmath23=0.0 . ] to calculate predicted cah band strengths and plot the derived indices against effective temperatures in figure  [ fig.model.index.plot ] .",
    "we evaluate stars with @xmath24 between 2700k and 4500k and [ m / h ] between 0.0 and @xmath43.0 . for the moment",
    ", we adopt _ log g _",
    "@xmath0 5.0 generically for subdwarfs .",
    "this gravity value does not apply to all types of subdwarfs , but we are presently interested in outlining the behavior of the cah features with metallicity alone .",
    "when @xmath24 is less than about 3300k , figure  [ fig.model.index.plot ] shows that the cah1 index decreases ( stronger absorption ) when metallicity decreases from 0.0 to @xmath42.0 at fixed @xmath24 .",
    "however , the trend reverses for [ m / h ] @xmath0 @xmath42.5 and @xmath43.0 .",
    "when @xmath24 is between 3300k and 3500k , there is a very weak relation between metallicity and the cah1 index , but from 0.0 to @xmath41.0 , the relation ( cah1 index decreases when metallicity decreases ) still holds .",
    "this relationship is degenerate for lower metallicities . for temperatures hotter than 3500k , the cah1 index increases ( weaker absorption ) as metallicity decreases , in contrast to the low temperature region . for the cah2@xmath3cah3 index ,",
    "the trends are generally the same , except that ( 1 ) at temperatures less than 3200k the index decreases ( stronger absorption ) only for 0.0 to @xmath41.0 , with a reversal for lower metallicities , and ( 2 ) the trend for higher temperature stars ( increasing index , weaker absorption with lower metallicity ) is the same , but the turnover is near 3200k rather than 3500k .",
    "even more important than these subtleties is that overall , the hotter the subdwarf , the weaker its cah bands .",
    "note the collapse of any differences between indices for hotter stars of various metallicities in figure  [ fig.model.index.plot ] .",
    "this collapse makes separating mid k - type subdwarfs from dwarfs based only on spectroscopic indices difficult using our spectral coverage ( 60009000 ) and resolution ( 68.6 ) .",
    "an alternative method , such as the hr diagram shown in figure  [ fig.hr.plot ] , sufficiently solves the problem for mid k - type subdwarfs and will be discussed in the next section .",
    "independent metallicity measurements via high resolution spectroscopic observations @xcite can also be utilized .",
    "our own spectra are not of sufficiently high resolution to measure metallicities , but all selected k - type subdwarfs have measured [ m / h ] @xmath25 @xmath40.5 from other publications .",
    "there are 31 subdwarfs having cah1 indices larger than 0.9 enclosed by the dashed box in figure  [ fig.cahn.plot ] . in this region , there are no subdwarfs with previously measured cah / tio5 indices to compare to our new sample of mid k - type stars , making it difficult to separate the dwarfs and subdwarfs based on the cah1 index alone .",
    "fortunately , 21 of these 31 stars have trigonometric parallaxes , and are plotted with concentric circles in figure  [ fig.hr.plot ] .",
    "at least 15 of these stars are subdwarfs based on their locations one or more magnitudes below the main sequence on the hr diagram .",
    "the star with the largest offset is den0515 - 7211p j051545.1@xmath4721122 ) . ] , located at @xmath26 = 3.3 , @xmath27 9.7 .",
    "this star is a full 4.5 magnitudes less luminous than the main sequence , but has no cah or tio5 features .",
    "two additional stars ( g016 - 009ab and g026 - 009acd ) above the main sequence are known to be double - line spectroscopic binaries with [ m / h ] @xmath280.5 .",
    "these individual targets are discussed in section 6.2 .",
    "the dwarf / subdwarf status of only four stars of the 21 remain ambiguous  we suspect that most of them are also subdwarfs , perhaps with as yet undetected companions elevating them into main sequence territory .    generally , the spectroscopic index method fails to distinguish subdwarfs from dwarfs if the derived cah1 index is greater than 0.9 . with the benefit of additional trigonometric parallax information and/or metallicity measurements , however , we can conclude that nearly all of these mid k - type stars are indeed subdwarfs .",
    "for late k - type ( redder than k5.0 ) and m - type stars , we use the gaia model grids to understand how the effective temperatures , metallicities , and gravities affect the shapes and features of subdwarfs spectra .",
    "this analysis allows us to develop a spectral sequence for cool subdwarfs of types k6.0 to m6.0 , which is tentatively extended blueward to k3.0 when additional information is incorporated .",
    "we plot gaia synthetic noiseless spectra in figure  [ fig.4800-2800.plot ] , at increments of 200k ( cooler than 4000k ) and 400k ( hotter than 4000k ) for stars with metallicities of [ m / h]@xmath29 0.0 , @xmath41.0 , and @xmath42.0 .",
    "because gravities have very limited impact on the overall shapes of the spectra ( shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] ) , we do not show gravity plots with fixed temperatures and metallicities ( of course , some features do change markedly with gravity , but not the overall slopes of the spectra ) . based on the synthetic spectra from gaia model grids , cool subdwarf spectra between 6000  and 9000",
    "exhibit the following trends :    * the effects of metallicity are minimal in low resolution subdwarf spectra for stars with temperatures of 4400k and hotter .",
    "this makes it difficult to separate dwarfs and subdwarfs using low resolution spectra ( as discussed in @xmath19[sec.k.subdwarf ] ) .",
    "however , from these noiseless spectra , we can still identify a few metallic lines showing metallicity trends .",
    "the most prominent feature is marked # 1 at 6256  in figure  [ fig.4800-2800.plot ] .",
    "unfortunately , we do not see this feature in any of our k - type spectra ( nor is it listed in table 1 of @xcite ) , so we consider its validity questionable .",
    "the next prominent feature , marked # 2 in figure  [ fig.4800-2800.plot ] , is ca i ( 6162 ) .",
    "this line can possibly be used to distinguish subdwarfs from dwarfs ( see examples discussed in @xmath19[sec.notes ] ) , but in practice it is somewhat difficult to evaluate in real spectra ( with noise ) at our resolution . * for stars with temperatures of 28004000k , metallicity strongly affects the spectra between 6000  and 8200 .",
    "this is the region that has been historically used to assign spectral types . in effect , subdwarfs with decreased metallicities have spectra that are `` brightened '' or `` less blanketed '' at the blue end , relative to solar metallicity stars .",
    "however , the continuum at wavelengths longer than 8200  for temperatures 34004800k is nearly free of metallicity effects . we can therefore use the 82009000  region to establish subtypes in the subdwarf spectral sequence because the slope is a function of temperature .",
    "this also allows us to mirror the spectral sequence for dwarfs , providing a useful link between the dwarf and subdwarf sequences .",
    "* the tio5 band strength at 70507150  is very sensitive to metallicity for temperatures cooler than 4000k .",
    "as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] , the tio5 band strength is effectively independent of gravity .",
    "we can therefore use the tio5 feature to separate subdwarfs with different metallicities if their continua ( 82009000 ) are the same , regardless of their gravities .",
    "* for a star of given temperature , stronger cah bands could be caused by lower metallicity , as shown in figure  [ fig.4800-2800.plot ] , or higher gravity , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] .",
    "if two subdwarfs have the same continua from 82009000  and the same tio5 band strength , but their cah bands are different , we can rank them by their relative gravities .",
    "consequently , the impediments to sorting cool subdwarf spectra at our resolution discussed in @xmath19[sec.sorting.spectra ] can be overcome by understanding the trends revealed in gaia synthetic spectra : ( 1 ) the mid k - type dwarfs have the same spectra as dwarfs for our spectral coverage and resolution , ( 2 ) cah features are affected by both metallicity and gravity , while the tio5 band is affected by metallicity but not gravity , and ( 3 ) the continuum from 8200  to 9000  is not strongly affected by either metallicity or gravity , so can therefore be used for spectral sequencing .",
    "to investigate the metallicity trends seen in gaia models , we compare our available spectra to metallicity measurements provided independently by others .",
    "measuring m dwarf metallicities is difficult , but several recent attempts have made progress @xcite .",
    "six red dwarfs that we have observed are included in the study by @xcite , comprising three pairs of m dwarfs of types m1.0v , m2.5v and m3.0v shown in figure  [ fig : bonfils.recons ] .",
    "each pair includes a relatively low metallicity dwarf ( gray ) , and a relatively high metallicity dwarf ( black ) .",
    "the red ends ( from 8200  to 9000 ) of each pair match one another , but the blue ends of the lower metallicity members is brighter in each case , as predicted by the gaia models .",
    "the effect is rather subtle , but the derived metallicities for each pair are not wildly different ( none of the six stars are subdwarfs ) , and yet the trend is confirmed in all three cases .",
    "one caveat is that the metallicities from these six stars were determined from the polynomial relation in @xcite , not measured directly from spectra , but this appears to be the best that can be done given the available data .",
    "we conclude that the metallicity trend revealed in the gaia models ( see figure  [ fig.4800-2800.plot ] ) is sound because it appears to be confirmed in real m dwarf spectra .",
    "contrary to the evidence for the metallicity trend , we have found no direct spectroscopic results to support the gravity trend in dwarfs and subdwarfs .",
    "direct gravity measurements are difficult because ( 1 ) stars must have both mass and radius measurements and ( 2 ) clean spectra without contamination from companions must be obtained .",
    "this limits the available target lists to eclipsing binaries such as those discussed in @xcite with cleanly deconvolved spectra or visual binaries in which individual radii can be measured via long baseline interferometry .",
    "neither class of objects yet provides a rich dataset for cool dwarfs or subdwarfs .",
    "hence , we rely on other observational or theoretical efforts to investigate the gravity trend .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] indicates that other than some sharp metallic lines , cah bands show the most prominent changes when gravity varies ( tio is unaffected by changing gravity ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the cah2 band is found in the spectra of m - type dwarfs , but is not observed in the spectra of m - type giants , thus identifying the cah2 band as a gravity indicator to separate dwarfs and giants .",
    "in addition to the gaia models , @xcite also showed that for stars with effective temperatures of 3250k , a spectrum from his atmospheric model with _",
    "@xmath0 5.75 has stronger cah2 than a spectrum with _",
    "@xmath0 4.75 .",
    "if the cah2 band is a gravity indicator , we may presume that the same gravity effects for cah1 and cah3 bands will be seen .    as shown in the two panels of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] ,",
    "the gaia models imply that the cah band strengths are indicators of both gravity and metallicity differences . in reality , if two red subdwarfs have spectra with the same overall continua and slopes , as well as matching tio band strengths ( e.g.  middle panel in figure  [ fig.problem.spect ] ) , the only remaining discrepancies will be at the cah bands .",
    "we believe that such differences are caused by different gravities .",
    "obviously , there is not yet a wealth of accurate direct observational results of red dwarfs and subdwarfs that can be used to stress test the metallicity and gravity trends seen in gaia models .",
    "nonetheless , what little we do have supports the trends , so we use these trends to assist us in establishing the subdwarf spectral sequence discussed below .",
    "in addition to presenting 88 subdwarfs , a goal of this project is to establish a subdwarf spectral sequence that mirrors the sequence for dwarfs and considers the latest available synthetic models .",
    "although synthetic models are not yet capable of fully representing the complicated spectra of these cool stars , the models can be used to investigate the primary factors that affect subdwarfs spectra .",
    "specifically , we examine the spectra in the framework of what appear to be the three main drivers of the trends observed  temperature , metallicity , and gravity .",
    "we first separate our available subdwarf spectra into several groups that have similar overall slopes .",
    "known subdwarfs such as lhs 12 , gj 161 , and lhs 2734a are used as anchor points . within each group , several stars that have high surface gravities are obvious because their spectra match except in cah , implying nearly identical temperatures and metallicities .",
    "we then compare each subdwarf s spectrum with our sequence of dwarf spectral standards and h@xmath30o absorption .",
    "this region overlaps with the cah3 and tio5 bands .",
    "thus , all subdwarfs would appear to have high gravity when compared to the sdss standards . ) , and ( 5 ) our dwarf spectra have been acquired using the same telescope / instrument / observing protocols as used for the subdwarfs , and the data have been reduced identically , so they are systematically consistent . ] that span types from k0.0 to m9.0 using an idl program to find the closest match to the continuum slope in the region 82009000 .",
    "visual checks of the matches between all subdwarf and standard dwarf spectra are also made to ensure match quality .",
    "based on the 88 confirmed cool subdwarf spectra we have , we present a sequence of subdwarfs with spectral types spanning k3.0 to m6.0 , listed in table  [ tbl.spectral.type ]",
    ". we also identify five additional g type subdwarfs .",
    "after the five g - type subdwarfs , we sort the cool subdwarfs from k3.0[vi ] to m6.0vi , using double lines in table  [ tbl.spectral.type ] to separate each type .    as discussed in @xmath19[sec.k.subdwarf ] , because mid k subdwarfs are virtually indistinguishable from k dwarfs at our spectral resolution , we use [ vi ] to indicate their questionable luminosity classes , which are currently based on their metallicities , kinematics , or locations on the hr diagram .",
    "we anticipate that higher resolution spectra will reveal these stars to be subdwarfs . a colon after the type indicates that we have had difficulty in assigning a subtype , metallicity , or gravity .    within each type for which sufficient spectra are available , we sort targets by their metallicities ( lowest metallicity first ) .",
    "a letter `` m '' indicates a star having the same metallicity as a main sequence dwarf , while more negative signs indicate lower metallicities , e.g. m@xmath31 is more metal poor than m@xmath4 .",
    "we use as many as six negative signs , because in the case of the m1.0vi type , we have 23 stars that fall into seven different metallicity categories .",
    "gravities are indicated by `` g '' with additional plus signs for higher gravities , e.g. g@xmath32 is higher gravity than g@xmath3 . a baseline subdwarf of low metallicity is assigned m@xmath4 and g. if a subdwarf has a similar metallicity but higher gravity , the designations are m@xmath4 and g@xmath3 .",
    "a few stars appear to have solar metallicity and are subluminous only because of high gravities ; these stars are assigned m and g@xmath3 .",
    "we have removed any stars from this study that might have gravities lower than main sequence stars , i.e.  slightly evolved stars such as subgiants , that would have gravity g@xmath4 .    note that values for metallicity and gravity are not comparable across all spectral types , i.e. m1.0vi with metallicity `` m@xmath4 '' is not equivalent to m2.0vi with metallicity `` m@xmath4 , '' nor is `` g@xmath3 '' for m1.0vi the same as `` g@xmath3 '' for m2.0vi .",
    "we can hope to formalize a definitive subdwarf spectral sequence that includes temperature , metallicity , and gravity trends when hundreds of systematically consistent subdwarf spectra and improved model grids are available .",
    "objects with virtually identical spectra are listed in alphabetical and/or numerical order .",
    "we discuss each spectral subtype from k3.0[vi ] to m6.0vi in the following sections and highlight noteworthy subdwarfs of various types .",
    "the order of the highlighted targets is based on their metallicities or gravities .",
    "colored spectra in the figures in these sections are illustrative only  they do not represent any numeric metallicities or gravities , so a red - lined spectrum in one type does not necessarily have similar attributes to a red - lined spectrum in another type .",

    "the types are based on fluxes redward of 7500 , with emphasis on three pseudo - continuum peak points at 8130 , 8250 and 8840  ( marked in figure  [ fig.m4.6 ] with dotted lines ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig.4800-2800.plot ] for stars cooler than 3200k , the flux decreases at these three points as the metallicity drops from [ m / h]=0.0 to @xmath41.0 and this trend becomes even more prominent as @xmath24 decreases .",

    "lhs 2067a was previously identified to be a subdwarf in @xcite , but no spectral type was given .",
    "although its cah1 and cah2+cah3 indices are not in the subdwarf region ( see figure  [ fig.cahn.plot ] and table  [ tbl.cahn.tio5.index ] ) , its spectrum is clearly different from m6.0v and m7.0v , with stronger cah1 absorption .",
    "it forms a wide ( @xmath555  ne ) common proper motion pair with a white dwarf , lhs 2067b , so it , like lhs 193ab and lhs 300ab , forms an intriguing pair that can be used for comparing metallicity and white dwarf ages . at the system s distance of 25.5 pc , the large separation of",
    "the pair corresponds to 472 au , indicating that significant pollution of the subdwarf by the white dwarf during its planetary nebula phase seems unlikely .    *",
    "lhs 334 * was reported to be a sdm4.5 subdwarf in @xcite .",
    "we assign it a type of m6.0vi because of the good match of the three pseudo - continuum peak points to lhs 2067a , which appears to be slightly more metal rich than lhs 334 .",
    "it is useful to apply our spectral typing methodology to the recent work of @xcite , who have provided a significant sample of sixty new subdwarf spectra , all acquired and reduced in a homogeneous way .",
    "the subdwarfs were selected and spectral types were assigned via their cah and tio indices . for comparison , we retrieved fifty of the publicly available spectra and use our new method to assign types .",
    "the brightest star among these subdwarfs has @xmath67=17.0 , resulting in somewhat noisy spectra for the sample , so we smoothed the spectra by averaging the flux over five pixels and normalizing at 7500 .",
    "representative spectra are shown in figures  [ fig.sdss.subdwarf.1 ] and  [ fig.sdss.subdwarf.2 ] .",
    "the sdss spectra have telluric lines removed , so we use m dwarf standard spectra from @xcite that also omit the telluric lines , rather than our own standards . in addition , @xcite do not present half - type standard spectra , so we do not present any half - type spectra for the sdss subdwarfs .",
    "previous and current types are listed in table  [ tbl.sdss.subdwarf ] .",
    "the subdwarfs have types between m1.0 and m3.0 in @xcite , while our efforts yield types between m2.0 and m5.0 .",
    "our point here is not to assign definitive spectral types , but to illustrate the gravity and metallicity effects in the sdss dataset , and provide examples of the application of our proposed spectral typing method .",
    "stars of a given spectral type , of course , may have a range of metallicities , as discussed at length in previous sections , and as is evident in figure  [ fig.sdss.subdwarf.1 ] .",
    "gravity effects are also seen , as shown in figure  [ fig.sdss.subdwarf.2 ] .",
    "three stars ( sdssj085843.89@xmath3511210.1 , sdssj093141.85@xmath3453914.5 and + sdssj145447.32@xmath3011006.8 ) previously identified as subdwarfs have spectra identical to sdss m dwarfs .",
    "two other stars , sdssj083217.77@xmath3522408.2 and sdssj113501.76@xmath3033720.3 , appear to have slightly higher gravities ( stronger cah1 line ) than dwarfs , but the rest of these two spectra are almost identical to sdss m dwarfs .",
    "therefore , to these two stars we assign types of m2.0vi : and m3.0vi : with g+ : , respectively .    unfortunately , the sdss dwarfs do not have parallaxes that can be used to confirm their locations on the hr diagram .",
    "in addition , we find many sdss subdwarfs with identical spectral types that have @xmath68 colors as different as 0.53 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to verify how metallicities and gravities affect the sdss absolute magnitudes and colors .",
    "nonetheless , the robust sample of @xcite provides many additional subdwarfs that can be targeted for further work .",

    "we have provided a consistent spectral sequence for subdwarfs that is based on linking observed subdwarf spectra to spectra acquired for main sequence dwarfs using the same telescope / instrument / observing protocols .",
    "here we compare synthetic to observed spectra to evaluate how well we can assign values for the temperatures , metallicities , and gravities of cool dwarfs and subdwarfs .      to test the reliability of the model grids and our fitting procedures",
    ", we use our six standard spectral sequence dwarfs with types m0.0v to m5.0v as test spectra ( see figure  [ fig.observed.model ] ) .",
    "all are currently believed to be uncorrupted single red dwarfs because they show no evidence of multiplicity from combinations of ( 1 ) hst / nicmos observations , ( 2 ) optical speckle observations , ( 3 ) optical ccd imaging , and/or ( 4 ) three or more years of astrometric observations that would reveal perturbations from unseen companions that contributed significant light to the system .",
    "we compared the spectral region from 6000  to 9000  after normalizing both the gaia grid spectra and ours at 7500 , and applying a gaussian function to the much higher resolution gaia model spectra to match our resolution .",
    "if a star had a significant spectral shift because of radial velocity , we manually offset the spectrum to match features obvious in the synthetic spectra .",
    "we then calculated the reduced @xmath69 differences ( hereafter , simply @xmath69 ) between the model grid spectra and ours .",
    "because the synthetic spectra do not have the telluric lines of o@xmath70 ( 62706330 ) , o@xmath30b ( 68606980 ) , o@xmath30a ( 75907710 ) and water ( 71507330  and 89529000 ) , these absorption regions were excluded in the @xmath69 calculations .",
    "the selected model grids have effective temperatures of 2400k to 4500k , [ m / h ] from @xmath42.0 to @xmath30.5 , and _ log g _ from 4.0 to 5.5 in steps of 100k , 0.5 dex , and 0.5 dex , respectively .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] shows that for a metallicity of @xmath41.0 and temperature 3500k , varying the gravity causes changes in only certain wavelength regions ( and some specific lines ) .",
    "this means @xmath69 is only sensitive to _ log g _ in relatively small spectral regions , but not for the overall spectrum . on the other hand , as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] , for the same temperature star with _",
    "log g _ fixed at 5.0 , there are large differences between spectra when the metallicity is varied .",
    "thus , for a star of a given temperature , the gravity changes the overall spectral shape minimally while the metallicity changes it a great deal , so we first secure a star s metallicity and then its gravity .",
    "figure  [ fig.gj701.chi2 ] is an example for m1.0v standard star , showing @xmath69 curves at various metallicities and gravities .",
    "each curve represents a specific _ log g _ and grid spectra have temperatures incremented by 100k .",
    "the smallest scatter in the plots is found when [ m / h ] is @xmath40.5 , which is adopted as the star s metallicity .",
    "we then examine each point in the [ m / h]@xmath0@xmath40.5 panel to find the best fit with the smallest @xmath69 at this fixed metallicity . in this case , the best fit has @xmath34 3600k , _ log g _",

    "in general , the overall slopes of the model spectra fit fairly well , especially for the earlier types .",
    "however , we discuss here six regions labeled at the top of figure  [ fig.observed.model ] that do not match , which are particularly relevant for the subdwarfs that are the focus of this paper .    1",
    ".   region 1 : the observed spectrum is always less luminous than the model , except for m0.0v .",
    "2 .   region 2 : this is the cah1 absorption region . observed spectra have shallower cah1 features than the models .",
    "the depth of cah1 is determined by a combination of gravity and metallicity .",
    "decreasing cah1 absorption can be caused by either decreasing gravity or decreasing metallicity .",
    "however , fine tuning the gravity or metallicity affects not only the cah1 feature , but the tio5 feature in region 4 .",
    "region 3 : the pseudo - continuum always peaks near 6530  in the observed spectra .",
    "however , the synthetic spectra have this peak `` red - shifted '' to @xmath56650 .",
    "region 4 : containing the cah2 , cah3 and tio5 features , this is the most important region for examining the interplay of metallicity and gravity in cool dwarfs .",
    "unfortunately , the cah2 feature is blended with o@xmath30b so it is not entirely reliable for analysis of spectra taken through the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the cah3 and tio5 features are usually weaker in observed spectra than in the models .",
    "the strength of tio5 is primarily driven by metallicity , not gravity ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ fig.3500.plot ] ) . therefore",
    ", this region reveals valuable information about a star s metallicity , in particular at types later than m2.0 .",
    "region 5 : several fe i absorption lines ( 8388 , 8440  and 8718 ) and a mg i line ( 8718 ) in the model spectra redward of 8300  are deeper than observed .",
    "this indicates poor metallicity matches and/or poor modeling of those particular lines .",
    "region 6 : overall , redward of 8000  the m4.0v and m5.0v matches are not as good as other regions .",
    "this likely indicates fundamental problems with the strengths of some opacity sources ( e.g.  h@xmath30o and tio ) in the models .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig.gj701.lp776 ] shows the two best fitting synthetic spectra for our m1.0v standard .",
    "the red spectrum ( 3600k , [ m / h]@xmath720.5 , _ log g_@xmath734.5 ) provides the best fit and the blue spectrum ( 3400k , [ m / h]@xmath721.0 , _ log g_@xmath734.0 ) is second best .",
    "there are only slight differences between the two synthetic spectra  the cah1 strengths and continuum fluxes redward of 8000  are the only notable differences . however , the effective temperatures for the two models differ by 200k , while the metallicities and _ log g _ each differ by 0.5 dex . the lower panel of figure  [ fig.gj701.lp776 ] shows the two best fit spectra for our m3.0v standard .",
    "the best fit ( red line ) yields 3200k , [ m / h]@xmath370.5 , _ log g_@xmath04.5 and the second best fit ( blue line ) yields 3300k , [ m / h]@xmath00.5 , _ log g_@xmath05.5 .",
    "however , neither model fit is an ideal match to the observed spectrum ( which is why the @xmath71 $ ] value for the two best matches differs by an order of magnitude ) , and matches become even poorer for cooler stars .    as a whole",
    ", many of the best fits for the main sequence dwarfs in figure  [ fig.observed.model ] are for metallicities of @xmath40.5 , which is somewhat lower than studies that have specifically attempted to assign metallicities to cool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "for example , the mean [ fe / h ] from 21 m dwarf secondaries in @xcite is @xmath40.09 , and the mean [ fe / h ] from five m dwarf secondaries in @xcite is @xmath40.17 .",
    "also worthy of note is that the fits were made for metallicities incremented by 0.5 dex , and stars with metallicities between @xmath40.5 and 0.0 may have slightly better fits for @xmath40.5 .",
    "one might think that interpolation from existing model grids would allow better fits .",
    "there are , however , degeneracy problems in matching model spectra to observations  when fitting the three - dimensional space of temperature , metallicity , and gravity , two or more synthetic spectra yield low points with similar @xmath69 , as is the case for the m1.0v example discussed above .",
    "more worrisome is that the overall discrepancies discussed above ( items 1 to 6 ) can not be removed through interpolation in the existing model grids .",
    "figure  [ fig.chi2.curve ] illustrates how the @xmath69 values change for best fit matches of the gaia models to our spectral standards with types m0.0v through m5.5v .",
    "spectral type m3.0v is the latest type for which a reasonably tight plot like the one shown in figure  [ fig.gj701.chi2 ] can be identified .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig.chi2.curve ] provides a dividing point between reasonable matches and poor matches , indicating that once @xmath69 exceeds 10 , the @xmath69 plots are too scattered to choose a unique set of model spectra parameters to match observed spectra .",
    "a specific example of applying the models to one of our subdwarfs illustrates the large discrepancies that must be overcome to derive reliable parameter values for metallicity and gravity .",
    "when we applied our fitting algorithm to our observed spectrum for lhs 335 ( m1.0vi , shown in figure  [ fig.lhs0335 ] ) , we discovered that the `` best fit '' was quite poor .",
    "although the formal @xmath69 value was 5.9 ( less than our cutoff of 10 , indicating a reliable fit ) , the model s cah3 band is not deep enough , the tio5 band is too deep , and the continuum flux redward of 7700  is less than observed .    for myriad reasons",
    "we conclude that we can not strictly determine reliable metallicities and _ log g _",
    "values for cool dwarfs using the fitting method discussed here .",
    "thus , until improved model grids are available , we defer assignment of numerical values for temperatures , metallicities and _ log g _ values .",
    "however , we certainly _ can _ use the gaia model grids to mimic _ trends _ ( discussed in @xmath19[sec.subdwarf.facts ] and  [ sec.trend ] ) in the spectra of subdwarfs to compare the stars within a framework of changing physical parameters .",
    "@xcite proposed that subdwarfs have two subclasses , `` subdwarfs '' ( _ sd _ ) and `` extreme subdwarfs '' ( _ esd _ ) based on their cah and tio5 band strengths .",
    "he separated the two classes using the line shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig.cahn.plot ] .",
    "another term , `` ultra subdwarf '' , was proposed by @xcite to describe gj 59b ( @xmath48 3.42 , @xmath49 7.89 ) , which is @xmath52.5 magnitudes underluminous compared to main sequence stars of similar color .",
    "this star falls in the region including `` extreme subdwarfs '' in @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite adopted the `` ultra subdwarf '' ( _ usd _ ) term for subdwarfs found to have stronger cah features than `` extreme subdwarfs '' .",
    "we believe these terms confuse the situation and do not address the underlying astrophysics .",
    "we recommend that they not be used for the following reasons .    *",
    "these terms can only be applied to m - type subdwarfs , not k - type subdwarfs . both observed spectra and models show that k subdwarfs do not follow the trends in cah absorption with metallicity that m subdwarfs follow .",
    "thus , there is no clear delineation for k - type subdwarfs . *",
    "empirically , the values of the indices are affected by a complicated interplay of temperature , metallicity , and gravity effects .",
    "one can not separate these three factors simply based on the indices . typically , when the term `` extreme '' subdwarf is used , it refers to `` very low metallicity '' alone .",
    "but that is only one part of the portrait that needs to be painted for a given subdwarf .",
    "for example , filled boxes shown in figure  [ fig.hr.plot ] indicate stars previously identified as extreme subdwarfs from their indices .",
    "note that the spread for `` extreme '' subdwarfs at a given color ( @xmath74 3.5 ) is 3.5 magnitudes , or a factor of @xmath525 in luminosity .",
    "there is no clear separation in the fundamental hr diagram between stars termed `` subdwarfs '' and `` extreme subdwarfs '' classified using spectral indices .",

    "it is clear from these three pairs that high gravity can push a subdwarf toward or into the extreme subdwarf region , even if the metallicities of the two objects are similar .",
    "in addition , many other high gravity subdwarfs ( green circles ) that do not have particularly low metallicities are also in the subdwarf region . finally , the two blue circles represent lhs 440 and scr 1822 - 45542 , which subdwarfs having the same metallicities but higher gravities than dwarfs .",
    "their spectroscopic features indicate that they are subdwarfs , but they do not have low metallicity at all . yet , they fall in the subdwarf region of the indices plot , which has traditionally indicated low metallicity . + the inset in figure  [ fig.subdwarf.sdm.esdm.index ] helps explain this phenomenon .",
    "we have calculated the spectral indices from the gaia synthetic spectra with [ m / h]@xmath00.0 , @xmath41.0 and @xmath42.0 and temperatures of 28004400k .",
    "two different gravities were selected for each metallicity .",
    "the models indicate that both low metallicity and high gravity push stars toward the extreme subdwarf region .",
    "thus , if two stars have the same metallicity , the one with higher gravity will be pushed more toward the extreme subdwarf region , indicating that this spectral indices plot is not a clear indicator of metallicity alone . * theoretically ,",
    "in order to show how complicated the tio5 vs cah1 plot is astrophysically , we use gaia model grids to do a demonstration . we have chosen models with 2700k @xmath75 4500k , @xmath43.0 @xmath76 < $ ] 0.0 and 4.0 @xmath77 5.5 , and have calculated the output cah and tio5 indices , as shown in figure  [ fig.cah1.tio5.vs.teff ] . as is apparent in the plots , for a given ( tio5 , cah1 ) indices pair",
    ", there are many possible parameter combinations .",
    "both indices are a function of temperature , gravity and metallicity , which would require a 6-d plot to describe tio5 vs cah .",
    "unfortunately , one can not classify stars as subdwarfs , extreme subdwarfs , or ultra - subdwarfs using 2-d index plots that infer trends in metallicity alone .    for these reasons",
    ", the indices only indicate a star s location on these particular spectroscopic indices plots .",
    "they do not address low or very low metallicity only , as implied by past usage , but instead incorporate effects of both metallicity and gravity for stars of a given temperature .",
    "they do not provide obvious or direct links to positions on hr diagrams , which provide the astrophysical meaning underlying stellar classification .",
    "finally , the modifiers `` extreme '' and `` ultra '' themselves have effectively the same meaning and do not provide meaningful information about their differences .      in the palomar - msu spectroscopy survey , @xcite used the tio5 index and polynomial equations to assign subtypes for m dwarfs .",
    "@xcite then applied the same methodology to m subdwarfs .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig.cah1.tio5.vs.teff ] , tio5 versus temperature is effectively linear , especially for _ log g _ @xmath0 5.0 and [ m / h ] @xmath0 0.0 ,",
    "so this typing method works successfully for a fairly homogeneous set of dwarfs ( possibly with somewhat different gravities )  temperature is the main factor affecting the overall slope of red dwarf spectra .",
    "however , it is not as simple for subdwarfs because both low metallicity and high gravity stars are sorted into the same tio5 values for various combinations . thus , the same methodology that works for dwarfs can not straightforwardly be applied to subdwarfs .",
    "@xcite recently released a set of spectral standards for the sdm , esdm and usdm subclasses using wider spectral coverage than used by @xcite and revised polynomial equations .",
    "their project is contemporaneous with ours , but unfortunately there is only one star in both samples , lhs 228 .",
    "we assign it a type of m3.0vi while their type is sdm2.0 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lepine.1 ] , gravity effects come into play in their spectra . each pair of spectra shown have nearly identical continua , with cah bands being the only significant spectral difference . using their method , each of the pairs of subdwarfs shown is assigned a different sub - type .",
    "we believe that by using the overall shape of the spectrum , with knowledge that both metallicity and gravity affect certain regions , each pair should have the same spectral sub - types . based on the trends from gaia models , the pairs of spectra shown",
    "have different gravities , as we have also seen in our spectra and those from sdss ( shown in @xmath19[sec : sdss ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lepine.2 ] illustrates spectral differences at types m3.0 , m5.0 and m7.5 .",
    "although the spectra in each panel have the same sub - types for sdm , esdm and usdm subdwarfs , they show very different continua between 6000  and 9000 . when examining the overall spectra , there is no clear morphology trend for each sub - type .",
    "we conclude that using spectral indices alone omits important information evident in the overall morphology of the spectra that is useful to spectral classification .",
    "we have discussed 88 cool subdwarfs using spectra covering 60009000 . based on these spectra and the trends from gaia model grids ,",
    "we have redefined the subdwarf spectral sequence , spanning types k3.0 to m6.0 .",
    "we find that wide spectral coverage is the key to defining a subdwarf s spectral type .",
    "we consider this to be an important , but not final , step in defining the subdwarf spectral sequence .    through the understanding of gaia model grids , we find that the key to assigning a subdwarf spectral type is to compare the spectrum to dwarf spectral standards in regions affected minimally by metallicity and gravity , thereby making a direct link between the dwarf and subdwarf sequences .",
    "even so , it remains difficult to establish a definitive sequence for subdwarfs because of the multi - faceted nature of their spectra .",
    "until we have surveyed a large number of subdwarfs and covered a multitude of possible temperatures , metallicities , and gravities , a definitive sequence will remain elusive .    from an analysis of the history of the term `` subdwarf , '' and the layout of the fundamental hr diagram , we propose that the suffix `` vi '' be used , rather than the `` sd '' prefix , as the preferred spectral classification notation .",
    "this reduces the confusion between cool subdwarfs and hot ob subdwarfs .",
    "this is also prudent because subdwarfs really do form an independent class of stars on the hr diagram , for which five roman numerals are in common use , with cool subdwarfs naturally falling beneath the main sequence v types .",
    "overall , we find that trigonometric parallaxes are crucial for identifying mid k - type subdwarfs , and allow us to understand how the complex interplay of temperatures , metallicities , and gravities affects the positions of cool dwarfs on the hr diagram .",
    "we found that mid k - type subdwarfs can not be identified spectroscopically using our data .",
    "there are many g and m - type subdwarfs , so k - type subdwarfs presumably exist , but additional information is needed to identify them .",
    "consequently , we use metallicities , kinematics , and parallaxes to acertain their true natures and use their locations on the hr diagram to flag them as `` subdwarfs '' ( other spectroscopic wavelength and resolution combinations could also be used ) .",
    "because they are not spectroscopically identified as subdwarfs in our spectra , we use a conservative notation , [ vi ] , for subdwarfs of types k3.0 through k5.0 to indicate their questionable status .",
    "we have confirmed that spectroscopic indices are useful in separating late k to late m - type subdwarfs from dwarfs , but that the indices have limitations when attempting to understand the astrophysical causes leading to observed subdwarf spectra . when combined with trigonometric parallax and photometric information ,",
    "our results show that for lower metallicities , subdwarfs are generally bluer and brighter at optical wavelengths , so they slide up and to the left on the hr diagram ( using axes @xmath59 vs @xmath9 ) .",
    "in contrast , higher gravities make stars redder and less luminous at optical wavelengths , so subdwarfs generally slide down and to the right on the same hr diagram .",
    "because of the complex , and not yet completely mapped out , interplay of temperatures , metallicities , and gravities , we conclude that the `` extreme '' and `` ultra '' prefixes _ only _ outline locations on spectroscopic indices plots , and do not successfully differentiate the underlying astrophysical causes for shifts on cah / tio5 plots .",
    "improvements in the subdwarf spectral sequence can be made by observing wide common proper motion subdwarf binaries , like lhs 2734ab discussed here .",
    "assuming identical metallicities , such binaries allow us to constrain one of the three variables that affects cool dwarf spectral types .",
    "the ultimate subdwarf spectral sequence will be three - dimensional , with temperature , metallicity , and gravity as independent variables ( see @xcite , figure 11 ) .",
    "previously , gravity effects in cool subdwarfs have been almost entirely ignored , as metallicity was the factor considered to describe changing cah features .",
    "our results clearly show the importance of gravity effects .",
    "an additional factor , contamination from an unseen , evolved , i.e.  white dwarf , companion could also change the slope of subdwarf spectra .",
    "thus , comprehensive surveys of subdwarfs for companions are warranted .",
    "finally , this work also shows that current synthetic spectra provide a useful framework in which to evaluate cool dwarf spectra , but they do not yet provide perfect matches , indicating that atmospheric models still require fine - tuning to make additional advances in the future characterization of cool dwarfs ( p. hauschildt private communication ) .",
