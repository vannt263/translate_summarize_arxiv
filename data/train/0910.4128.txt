    "secure transmission of confidential messages is a critical issue in communication systems and especially in wireless systems due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions . in @xcite , wyner addressed the transmission security from an information - theoretic point of view , and identified the rate - equivocation region and established the secrecy capacity of the discrete memoryless wiretap channel in which the wiretapper receives a degraded version of the signal observed by the legitimate receiver .",
    "the secrecy capacity is defined as the maximum communication rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver , which can be achieved while keeping the eavesdropper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages .",
    "later , these results are extended to gaussian wiretap channel in @xcite . in @xcite , csiszr and krner",
    "considered a more general wiretap channel model and established the secrecy capacity when the transmitter has a common message for two receivers and a confidential message to only one .",
    "recently , there has been a flurry of activity in the area of information - theoretic security , where , for instance , the impact of fading , cooperation , and interference on secrecy are studied ( see e.g. , @xcite and the articles and references therein ) .",
    "several recent results also addressed the secrecy capacity when multiple - antennas are employed by the transmitter , receiver , and the eavedropper @xcite@xcite .",
    "the secrecy capacity for the most general case in which arbitrary number of antennas are present at each terminal has been established in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to security issues , another pivotal concern in most wireless systems is energy - efficient operation especially when wireless units are powered by batteries . from an information - theoretic perspective",
    ", energy efficiency can be measured by the energy required to send one information bit reliably .",
    "it is well - known that for unfaded and fading gaussian channels subject to average input power constraints , energy efficiency improves as one operates at lower @xmath0 levels , and the minimum bit energy is achieved as @xmath0 vanishes @xcite .",
    "hence , requirements on energy efficiency necessitate operation in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "additionally , operating at low @xmath0 levels has its benefits in terms of limiting the interference in wireless systems .    in this paper , in order to address the two critical issues of security and energy - efficiency jointly , we study the secrecy capacity in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that operation at low @xmath0s , in addition to improving the energy efficiency , is beneficial from a security perspective as well . in the low-@xmath0 regime , either the transmission power is small or the bandwidth is large . in either case",
    ", we have low probability of intercept as it is generally difficult for an eavesdropper to detect the signals in this regime .",
    "we consider a general multiple - input and multiple - output ( mimo ) channel model and identify the optimal transmission strategies in the low-@xmath0 regime under secrecy constraints .",
    "since secrecy capacity is in general smaller than the capacity attained in the absence of confidentiality concerns , energy per bit requirements increase due to secrecy constraints . in this work ,",
    "we quantify these increased energy costs and address the tradeoff between secrecy and energy efficiency .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are listed below :    1 .",
    "we determine the first and second derivatives of the secrecy capacity at @xmath1 , and provide a second - order approximation to the mimo secrecy capacity in the low-@xmath0 regime . through this analysis",
    ", we quantify the impact of secrecy constraints on the performance .",
    "we identify the optimal transmission strategies in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "in particular , we determine that transmission in the maximal - eigenvalue eigenspace of a certain matrix that depends on the channel matrices is second - order optimal . in the case in which the maximum eigenvalue is distinct , beamforming is shown to be optimal .",
    "we find the minimum energy required to send one bit both reliably and securely .",
    "we characterize the tradeoff between energy efficiency and secrecy .",
    "we investigate the impact of fading by studying the low-@xmath0 secrecy capacity in fading scenarios .",
    "we show that in general both independent and correlated fading improves the energy efficiency .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : channelmodel ] , we describe the channel model . in section [ sec : lowsnrsecrecy ] , we study the secrecy capacity in the low-@xmath0 regime and determine the minimum energy per secret bit . we investigate the impact of fading in section [ sec : fading ] and provide conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "the behavior of the secrecy capacity can be accurately predicted by its first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath0 at @xmath1 : @xmath35 moreover , @xmath36 and @xmath37 also enable us to analyze the energy efficiency in the low-@xmath0 regime through the following notions @xcite : @xmath38 ^ 2}{-{\\ddot{c}_s(0)}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the minimum bit energy required for reliable communication under secrecy constraints ( or equivalently minimum energy per secret bit ) , and @xmath40 denotes the wideband slope which is the slope of the secrecy capacity in bits / dimension/(3 db ) at the point @xmath39 .",
