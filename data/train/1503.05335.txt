    "two - qubit gates with atoms can be realized by transferring them into high - lying rydberg states , in which the atoms can interact via strong and long - distance van der waals and dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . in the seminal proposal @xcite of a controlled phase gate for atomic qubits based on interaction in rydberg states two realizations",
    "have been discussed .",
    "the first one works for close atoms in a regime when the interaction strength @xmath2 exceeds the rabi frequency @xmath3 of excitation pulses coupling qubit states to the rydberg ones : @xmath4 . in this regime of a rydberg blockade",
    "the strong interaction prevents excitation of a second atom if the first atom has been excited .",
    "the blockade has been experimentally demonstrated for two atoms in separate dipole traps @xcite , followed by realization of a cnot gate @xcite and entanglement @xcite .",
    "a second approach to the controlled phase gate , discussed in @xcite , applies to smaller interaction strengths @xmath5 , for which the blockade can not work .",
    "the gate then can be implemented by conditionally exciting both atoms to the rydberg state , letting them interact to accumulate a @xmath6 phase shift , and deexciting back to their original qubit states .",
    "this allows to realize the gate between atoms separated by several sites in an optical lattice architecture and between atoms in distant individual microtraps , making the systems scalable .",
    "the second approach has not yet been realized experimentally and is currently a subject of active theoretical investigation @xcite .",
    "interactions in rydberg states can also find applications in quantum simulation @xcite , quantum repeaters @xcite , and in the realization of efficient and non - local nonlinearities @xcite , down to a single photon level @xcite .",
    "coherent control techniques such as stirap @xcite and adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) @xcite can provide robust excitation to the two - atom rydberg state .",
    "transfer of two atoms to the double rydberg state by stirap was studied in @xcite , where it was shown that in a system of three - level atoms , typically used in experiments , having ground @xmath7 , intermediate @xmath8 and rydberg states @xmath9 ( shown in fig.[fig : level - scheme ] ) , the only dark state does not connect the two - atom ground @xmath10 and rydberg @xmath11 states .",
    "application of pump and stokes pulses , resonant with the @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions , respectively , transfers the system from @xmath10 to an entangled @xmath14 state , not containing @xmath11 . in a later work",
    "@xcite it was found that a non - zero one - photon detuning @xmath15 in the stirap scheme produces a dressed state directly connecting @xmath10 to @xmath11 , but the transfer efficiency to that state was not optimal because of population loss from a fast decaying intermediate state .",
    "stirap - like excitation to the @xmath11 state with larger detunings @xmath16 hundreds mhz can also be realized using optimal control techniques by shaping the pulses such that the population of the intermediate state is minimized @xcite .",
    "adiabatic rapid passage with chirped optical pulses is well - known for providing efficient population transfer between quantum states , and it will be studied in this work as a means to achieve robust excitation to double rydberg states . in the two - photon arp excitation scheme of fig.[fig : level - scheme ] a large one - photon detuning from the fast - decaying intermediate state can be used , allowing to minimize its population and obtain high transfer efficiencies . in section",
    "ii we show that the two - atom system can be excited to the double rydberg state along one of the dressed states , directly connecting @xmath10 to @xmath11 . in section iii",
    "we numerically calculate the transfer efficiency for rb atoms taking into account decays from the intermediate and rydberg states and analyze its dependence on rabi frequencies and chirp rates of the pulses .",
    "finally , in section iv we calculate the fidelity of the controlled phase gate which can be realized by conditionally transferring the ground state qubits to the @xmath11 state and back such that the qubit state @xmath17 accumulates the @xmath6 phase shift , and conclude in section v.",
    "we consider two three - level atoms with internal states @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , shown in fig.[fig : level - scheme ] .",
    "each atom interacts with two chirped laser pulses , pump and stokes , on the transitions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . in the rydberg states",
    "@xmath9 they additionally interact with each other via dipole - dipole or van der waals interactions .",
    "the system can be described by the schrodinger equation assuming that all the interactions are much faster compared to decays of intermediate and rydberg states . for simplicity of the analysis",
    "one can use `` molecular '' states : @xmath10 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath11 .",
    "expanded in these states the two atom wave function has a form @xmath22 , where the amplitudes of the `` molecular '' states are expressed via amplitudes of pure two atom states as follows : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the rotating wave approximation is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the one and two - photon detunings of the pump and stokes field frequencies @xmath29 and @xmath30 from the atomic transition frequencies @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the dipole moments of the corresponding transitions and @xmath35 are the amplitudes of the pump and stokes fields .",
    "the schrodinger equations for the `` molecular '' state amplitudes are then given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the rabi frequencies of the pump and stokes fields .",
    "first , one can notice from eqs.([eq : schrod ] ) that the @xmath39 and @xmath40 states decouple , i.e. laser fields connect only states within these subsystems .",
    "second , the @xmath10 state is laser coupled only to @xmath39 states such that if initially the atoms are in the @xmath10 state , the @xmath40 subsystem is never populated , and , therefore , can be discarded in the present model which neglects decays .",
    "next , we assume that the one - photon detuning is large @xmath41 such that the amplitudes @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be replaced by their steady - state solutions as follows : @xmath45 expressing further the @xmath42 and @xmath44 in terms of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 we eliminate the intermediate state @xmath8 and reduce the system eqs.([eq : schrod ] ) to three equations for states @xmath10 , @xmath49 and @xmath11 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the two - photon rabi frequency . one can now obtain the dressed states of the two atom system and their energies @xmath52 from the energy equation : @xmath53 neglecting the @xmath54 term and setting @xmath55 allows one to obtain analytical expressions for the dressed states and their energies in the absence of the rydberg - rydberg interaction : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is related to the @xmath58 signs , respectively .",
    "the corresponding dressed states are the following : @xmath59 we can analyze the dressed states in the limits of a large two - photon detuning @xmath60 : @xmath61 : @xmath62 which shows that @xmath63 for large @xmath64 and @xmath65 for large @xmath66 . as a result",

    "we are interested in the case @xmath72 , when the dipole blockade is not working , and investigate how two atoms can be transferred to the double rydberg state in this regime .",
    "the energies and the amplitudes of the @xmath10 , @xmath73 and @xmath11 components of the @xmath69 and @xmath74 states in the case @xmath75 are shown in fig.[fig : dressed - states]a , b and c , respectively .",
    "one can see that for a large positive @xmath60 @xmath63 and for a large negative @xmath60 @xmath65 ( for a large negative @xmath60 @xmath76 and for a large positive @xmath60 @xmath77 ) , as expected from eq.([eq : limits ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig : dressed - states ] shows , therefore , that for intermediate interaction strengths the system can still be transferred from @xmath10 to @xmath11 if it adiabatically follows either @xmath74 for a negative chirp rate or @xmath69 for a positive one .",
    "in this section we numerically analyze the efficiency of two - photon excitation from @xmath10 to a double rydberg state @xmath11 using adiabatic rapid passage .",
    "we consider two three - level atoms interacting with pump and stokes optical pulses and with each other via vdw or dipole - dipole interaction according to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we also take into account radiative decays from the intermediate @xmath8 and rydberg @xmath9 states and describe the system using a density matrix equation : @xmath78+{\\cal l}\\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lindblad term , incorporating the decays , is as follows : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 are the raising and lowering operators for the j@xmath84 atom , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are radiative decay rates of the intermediate and rydberg states . the pump and stokes pulses rabi frequencies have a gaussian form @xmath87 and detunings are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the linear chirp rate of the pulses , assumed equal for both .",
    "the population @xmath91 of the double rydberg state , i.e. the excitation efficiency , is shown in fig.[fig : transfer - eff ] for a range of two - photon rabi frequencies and chirp rates . in calculations parameters of @xmath92rb atoms",
    "were used with @xmath8=5p@xmath93 with decay rate @xmath94 mhz and @xmath95s with @xmath96 hz , which included the decay due to spontaneous emission ( @xmath97 hz ) and due to interaction with black - body radiation at @xmath98 k ( @xmath99 hz ) .",
    "one can see that the efficiency reaches @xmath100 for sufficiently high two - photon rabi frequencies and chirp rates , providing adiabatic interaction between atoms and laser pulses .",
    "adiabaticity requires that @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xcite , where @xmath103 is the two - photon chirp rate , as well as equal rabi frequencies @xmath104 , pulse durations @xmath105 and chirp rates of the pump and stokes pulses . from fig.[fig : transfer - eff]a one can see that the efficiency becomes high ( @xmath106 ) for @xmath107 mhz/@xmath1s and @xmath108 mhz because for these parameters ( using pulse durations @xmath109 @xmath1s ) the adiabaticity conditions are satisfied : @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "fig.[fig : transfer - time - dep ] gives the time evolution of populations of the @xmath10 , @xmath49 and @xmath11 states during the excitation .",
    "the parameters of the pulses providing efficient transfer are challenging but within experimental reach : currently the rabi frequencies of the pump and stokes pulses can be increased up to @xmath112 mhz @xcite , while the chirp rates can be as high as @xmath113 ghz/@xmath1s @xcite .",
    "the interaction in rydberg states can be used to realize a controlled phase gate @xmath114 , which acts on two - qubit states @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) as @xmath117 .",
    "the gate can be implemented using arp excitation in the following way . in the first step",
    "four - level atoms , shown in fig.[fig : level - scheme ] , interact with a chirped two - photon pulse such that the system initially in @xmath118 evolves along the @xmath74 dressed state . at the end of the pulse",
    "the atoms will be transferred into @xmath11 and acquire a phase factor @xmath119 . at the same time the states @xmath120 and",
    "@xmath121 will evolve into @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively , and acquire a phase factor @xmath124 , where @xmath125 are the dressed state energies for a single atom interacting with the two - photon chirped pulse @xcite .",
    "one can see from eq.([eq : eigenenergies ] ) that if @xmath55 and @xmath104 , @xmath126 as expected .",
    "when @xmath127 we can estimate the eigenenergies using eq.([eq : eigenequation ] ) in the limit of small interaction strengths assuming @xmath128 : @xmath129 where @xmath104 was set again .",
    "it shows that for @xmath130 , the phase accumulated by the state @xmath17 , when it is transferred to @xmath11 , differs from twice the phase of the states @xmath131 and @xmath132 when they are transferred to @xmath123 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "we also assume that the state @xmath133 is not interacting with the pulse , which can be realized e.g. by choosing a specific polarization of the pump field . as a result ,",
    "the state @xmath133 will acquire zero phase .    in the second step",
    "the system returns back into qubit subspace with useful phases . to realize it one can apply the following trick @xcite : ( i ) the chirp in the first and the second steps has the same sign such that @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the time boundary between the steps , as shown in fig.[fig : fidelity]a .",
    "the system then returns from @xmath11 to @xmath10 along @xmath69 , and from @xmath122 and @xmath123 to @xmath132 and @xmath131 along @xmath136 ; ( ii ) the one - photon detuning changes sign in the second step with respect to the first one @xmath137 .",
    "provided the pump and stokes pulses are applied symmetrically in time @xmath138 ( see fig.[fig : fidelity]a ) , the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) allow to cancel the overall phase accumulated by the @xmath132 and @xmath131 states : @xmath139 . at the same time , the phase accumulated by the @xmath17 state @xmath140 . by adjusting the pulse parameters and interpulse time @xmath141 can be realized , which will produce the gate . for small interaction strengths",
    "one can estimate the @xmath142 phase using eq.([eq : pi - phase ] ) : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the time duration of each step , assumed equal , and @xmath134 was applied in the last line .",
    "using linearly chirped pulses with @xmath145 where @xmath146 and setting @xmath147 for simplicity we have @xmath148 in the limit @xmath149 one obtains @xmath150 , showing that the duration of each step is @xmath151 , of the same order as the time between two stirap pulse sequencies required to accumulate a @xmath6 phase shift in @xcite . for small interaction strengths the gate duration can become comparable to the rydberg state decay time , which will reduce gate fidelity .",
    "high fidelities are expected for intermediate strengths @xmath72 , and fig.[fig : fidelity]b shows the fidelity @xmath152 numerically calculated in this regime , where the expected state of the system in the absence of errors is @xmath153 and @xmath154 is the density matrix of the system at the end of the second step taking into account population and coherence decays .",
    "an initial state of the system @xmath155 was used and the density matrix evolution was modelled by eq.([eq : dens - matr ] ) with decays given by the lindblad term ( [ eq : lindblad ] ) , in which we assumed for simplicity that the population in the rydberg state decayed to the intermediate state and in the intermediate state to @xmath156 , i.e. there was no decay into the @xmath157 state .",
    "it was also assumed that the @xmath158 state was not interacting with the chirped pulse .",
    "the same parameters of @xmath92rb were used : the radiative decay rates @xmath94 mhz and @xmath96 hz , corresponding to the 5p@xmath93 and 80s states @xcite , respectively , and the energy splitting between the qubit states of @xmath159 ghz , corresponding to the hyperfine splitting between ground state @xmath160 and @xmath161 sublevels . during calculations",
    "the conditions of the first and second steps were applied : the rabi frequencies were symmetric , and chirp rate and one - photon detuning antisymmetric with respect to the step time boundary . in order to accumulate the @xmath6 phase shift in the @xmath17 state the time delay between two pulse sequencies @xmath162",
    "was adjusted every time @xmath2 was changed .",
    "fig.[fig : fidelity]c shows time dependence of the dressed state energy during both steps for @xmath75 , with the phase @xmath142 given by the integral @xmath163 .",
    "fidelities @xmath164 were obtained for @xmath165 , limited by an incomplete conversion of @xmath10 into @xmath11 during the first step , i.e. less than @xmath166 transfer efficiency @xmath91 , which resulted in a small admixture of the @xmath74 dressed state to the @xmath69 state during the second step , when the system returned from @xmath11 to @xmath10 .",
    "the obtained fidelities are comparable to the ones expected in the stirap - based excitation scheme @xcite .",
    "we checked the effect of the intermediate state decay on the fidelity , which was an important source of error in @xcite , and found that complete cancellation of the decay gives the fidelity increase @xmath167 .",
    "the intermediate state decay is less important in our scheme due to a large one - photon detuning .",
    "decay from the rydberg state also does not significantly affect the gate in our case due to its short duration @xmath168 ns and small decay rate @xmath169 hz .",
    "another possible way to implement the controlled phase gate is to follow the same dressed state , e.g. the @xmath74 , in both steps , which can be done if the chirp rate changes sign in the second step such that @xmath170 . in this case at the end of the second step the state @xmath17 will acquire the phase shift @xmath171 , and the @xmath131 and @xmath132 states will acquire the shift @xmath172 .",
    "the simplest way to realize this is to adjust pulse parameters in such a way that @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( for small @xmath2 @xmath175 , for larger @xmath2 @xmath176 ) .",
    "however , this scheme might be more challenging than the one discussed above , because two phases have to be simultaneously tuned to specific values .",
    "the above fidelity calculations assume that the atomic motion is frozen during the gate .",
    "this assumption can be violated due to mechanical forces acting on atoms in the double rydberg state @xcite .",
    "the forces can result in excitation of higher motional states for atoms trapped in microtraps and optical lattices , resulting in undesirable entanglement between the motional and qubit states .",
    "we estimate the probability of excitation from a ground to the first excited motional state for atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "the amplitude of the first motional state after the system is deexcited from the double rydberg state is @xmath177 , where @xmath178 , is the force acting between two atoms interacting via the van der waals @xmath179 interaction , @xmath180 is the trapping potential oscillation frequency and @xmath181 is the ground motional state wavefunction width , @xmath182 is the distance between atoms , and @xmath162 is the time the system spends in the double rydberg state . assuming @xmath183 mhz , corresponding to @xmath184 @xmath1 m for atoms in the 80s state @xcite , @xmath185 khz , @xmath186 nm and @xmath187 ns , the probability of the motional state excitation @xmath188 , which gives the additional error in the fidelity .    our analysis shows that the arp and stirap - type excitation @xcite to the double rydberg state , which use simple analytic pulse sequencies , predict similar high controlled phase gate fidelities @xmath164 and @xmath100 in the former and the latter cases , respectively",
    ". however , these values are not good enough to allow fault - tolerant quantum computation , which requires the gate fidelity @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "one of the strategies to increase the fidelity is to apply more complex coherent control techniques such as optimal control @xcite and genetic @xcite algorithms to shape laser pulses .",
    "optimal control of stirap based blockaded controlled phase gate has been analyzed recently in @xcite , where it was shown that the gate error can be decreased by an order of magnitude ( from @xmath190 to @xmath191 ) if one uses optimized pulse sequences instead of analytic .",
    "optimization of chirped pulses , first proposed in @xcite , is succesfully used to achieve efficient population transfer between molecular states @xcite and might help to improve the fidelity of the arp based gate , which will be the subject of a future work .",
    "in conclusion , we analyzed excitation of two ground state atoms to a double rydberg state by a chirped two - photon pulse using adiabatic rapid passage . during arp - type",
    "excitation dressed states of the coupled atoms - light system provide direct connection of the @xmath10 to the double rydberg @xmath11 state contrary to the case of resonant stirap @xcite . numerical analysis taking into account population and coherence",
    "decays predicts robust transfer to the @xmath11 state that can reach high efficiency @xmath100 in the case of @xmath92rb atoms for intermediate interaction strengths @xmath192 .",
    "the high transfer efficiency is possible due to a large one - photon detuning allowed in the arp scheme , minimizing losses from the fast - decaying intermediate state .",
    "the large one - photon detuning has to be compensated by high rabi frequencies @xmath193 mhz of the pump and stokes pulses to achieve adiabaticity , but they are currently within experimental reach along with required chirp rates @xmath0hundreds mhz/@xmath1s .",
    "we also considered a controlled phase gate for two atomic qubits based on arp transfer to interacting rydberg states . applying antisymmetric one- and two - photon detunings and symmetric rabi frequencies during excitation and deexcitation steps one can cancel the phases of the @xmath131 and @xmath132 qubit states and",
    "tune the phase of the @xmath17 state to @xmath6 , producing the gate .",
    "gate fidelities @xmath164 were numerically predicted at @xmath192 for @xmath92rb atoms , limited by incomplete switching of the dressed states between the excitation and deexcitation steps .",
    "our analysis shows that arp and stirap - type double rydberg state excitations using simple analytic pulse sequencies are expected to achieve comparable transfer efficiencies and controlled phase gate fidelities , which are high but still insufficient for fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "one of the ways to increase the transfer efficiency and therefore the gate fidelity is to use more complex optimized chirped pulses .",
