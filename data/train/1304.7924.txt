    "inflation  @xcite has been so far very successful to account for the observational data  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the simple idea that the universe went through a huge accelerating expansion during the early stage of its evolution driven by a single ( multiple ) scalar field(s ) .",
    "it provides not only spatially flat and homogeneous universe but also a source for small primordial perturbations which are the origin of the large - scale structure of our universe today .",
    "even though the data are compatible with the single field inflation , there have been considerable interests in multi - field inflation .    from the point of view of cosmological perturbations  @xcite ,",
    "multi - field inflation exhibits distinctive features of the non - gaussianity  @xcite and generates isocurvature ( entropy ) perturbations in addition to adiabatic perturbations of the single scalar field model .",
    "there exists an extensive amount of literature how these aspects are incorporated into the specific multi - field inflationary models  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the presence of isocurvature modes corresponds to relative perturbations among the various matter fields and affects the final curvature perturbation at the end of inflation by acting as a source term in the evolution equation for the curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "so far , most of analysis focused on the time - dependent backgrounds in which each of the scalar field is a function of time only .",
    "however , growing interest in this field motivates to seek other theoretical possibilities .",
    "one of the alternative approaches is to consider spatially dependent backgrounds in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "it seems that relatively little attention has been paid to spatially dependent backgrounds in inflation",
    ". this might be due to the obstacle which is inherent in these solutions in cosmology : in general , these configurations are not compatible with the cosmological principle of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "however , the conflict can be avoided in the nonlinear sigma models which include a triad of scalar fields , @xmath8 .",
    "were considered before in @xcite .",
    "the main interest of the paper @xcite was to create statistically anisotropic and inhomogeneous perturbations with metric perturbations .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite the authors introduced so(3 ) symmetric scalar fields only without potential for the scalar fields .",
    "the background solution for the triad of the scalar fields is the same with ours .",
    "they considered linear perturbations and non - gaussianity for the model , dubbed as _",
    "solid inflation_. as we see in , we additionally considered the inflaton with a potential and find nontrivial results in the linear scalar perturbations .",
    "] it is known that by correlating each scalar field with spatial coordinate , @xmath9 , one can maintain the isotropy and homogeneity in a wide class of field theory models whose lagrangians are functions of @xmath10 without the potential for the @xmath11 fields .",
    "the ansatz for scalar fields of a nonlinear sigma model , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) with the extra dimension @xmath14 , first appeared in the higher dimensional gravity theory and the solutions of the scalar fields trigger spontaneous compactification of the extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the compactified extra space is isomorphic to the target space of scalar fields . a similar ansatz which break the diffeomorphism invariance",
    "was used to give masses to gravitons as a higgs mechanism of gravity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the coordinate dependent ansatz in the nonlinear sigma model in gravity theories can be considered as a method of constructing the massive gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "recently , the four scalar fields were combined into de sitter target space and used in describing the late - time accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for related topics .",
    "motivated by the nonlinear sigma models inherited from the higher dimensional gravity theories , in this paper , we consider a nonlinear sigma model with a potential as an action of matter fields in four - dimensional gravity theory , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the planck mass , @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 can be considered as an internal metric of a four - dimensional riemannian manifold . to construct an inflationary model",
    ", we consider a specific choice for the internal metric and potential , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) is an arbitrary positive function of @xmath23 has a negative kinetic energy . ] .",
    "then the resulting model can be considered as the single scalar field model interacting with a triad of scalar fields @xmath11 , where the coupling among the inflaton @xmath23 and the triad of scalar fields is non - minimal , @xmath24 .",
    "we try to describe the cosmological inflation in terms of the action . as a background solution with the choice of",
    ", we apply the ansatz @xmath25 for the background evolution , assuming that other dynamical fields depend on the cosmic time only . as we discussed previously ,",
    "the resulting cosmological evolution becomes homogeneous and isotropic with the frw metric .",
    "for the background evolution , we find an exact solution describing the power - law inflation and try to figure out the properties of the slow - roll inflation of our model .",
    "we consider the linearized scalar and tensor perturbations for the slow - roll inflation with a small spatial constant gradient @xmath0 for the triad of scalar fields .",
    "the scalar modes have two degrees of freedom , one from @xmath23 and the other from the scalar mode of the triad .",
    "they are decoupled from each other in the minimal coupling @xmath26 and have the form of sasaki - mukhanov equation  @xcite _ in the spatially flat gauge .",
    "_ we obtain the leading contributions of @xmath0 for the power spectrums and spectral indices of the comoving curvature and isocurvature perturbations",
    ".    one interesting feature of our approach is that in the slow - roll case , the requirement of unitarity for the initial quantum state imposes _ a lower bound _ on the comoving wave number .",
    "the existence of this limit is a consequence of the nonvanishing aforementioned free parameter @xmath0 associated with spatial condensations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we start from the action with the choice . using the ansatz @xmath25 for the triad of scalar fields ,",
    "we obtain an exact solution for the power - law inflation and investigate the properties of the background evolution for the slow - roll inflation . in section 3 , we write the perturbed equations for the scalar and tensor modes and discuss the gauge conditions for the scalar perturbation . in section 4 , we describe the behaviors of the perturbations up to leading order of @xmath0 and obtain cosmological quantities .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we start from the action with the choice , @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 s have an so(3 ) symmetry .",
    "this action can be considered as the single field inflation model with a triad of scalar fields having noncanonical kinetic terms .",
    "we read the energy - momentum tensor as @xmath28,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and equations of motion of the scalar fields @xmath23 and @xmath11 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the potential in only depends on the single scalar field @xmath23 .",
    "the reason is related with our choice of the spatially linear background solution for the scalar fields @xmath11 , which can guarantee the cosmological principle of homogeneity with a so(3 ) invariant potential . as we will see in the next paragraph , the spatially linear solution for @xmath11 in the background frw metric can not be the solution of the equations of motion in the presence of a nonvanishing potential of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the energy - momentum tensor becomes a function of the spatial coordinates , which means the breakdown of the cosmological principle of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "therefore , the vanishing of the potential for @xmath11 is crucial in this paper .",
    "now we consider the background evolution in our setup .",
    "the background frw metric is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the scale factor .",
    "in this paper , we consider an ansatz for the scalar field @xmath11 as @xmath33 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary dimensionless constant . under the assumption that the scalar field @xmath23 is spatially homogeneous",
    ", we easily see that the ansatz satisfies the equation of motion for @xmath11 in .",
    "remaining equations of motion for @xmath34 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 as we see from these background equations , the homogeneity of the background evolution is not spoiled though we take the spatially dependent ansatz for @xmath11 in .",
    "the @xmath39-dependent terms in are originated from the contributions of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the equation of state of @xmath40-fields is @xmath41 . for concreteness",
    ", we fix the function @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an arbitrary constant . in the case",
    "@xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 , the role of the @xmath47-dependent term in is the same as the curvature constant determining the spatial curvature in the friedmann equations .",
    "since we are considering the positive @xmath47 , the background evolution under the spatial dependent solution corresponds to that of the open universe .",
    "however , our model is different from the single field inflation model on the background metric of the open universe . as we will see later , there are nontrivial roles of @xmath11 in the perturbation level .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to investigate the behaviors of our model from the point of view of linear perturbations .",
    "before we move on to the subject of the perturbation , we describe the background evolutions of our model by considering two inflationary scenarios , the power - law inflation and the slow - roll inflation .",
    "it is well - known that under an exponential - type potential the single scalar field model has an exact solution describing the power - law inflation  @xcite . comparing with the single scalar field model ,",
    "there are @xmath0-dependent terms in , which are originated from the spatially dependent background solution for @xmath11 . as we will see in this subsection , the exact solution for the power - law inflation in the single scalar field model can be a solution of the equations of motion in with some deformations by parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath0 .",
    "as in the case of the single scalar field model , we consider an exponential - type potential @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are arbitrary constants .",
    "we consider an ansatz which describes the power - law inflation , @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are dimensionless constants .    when @xmath55 , the background equations reduce to those of the single scalar field model .",
    "the constant parameters in the power - law solution are determined as @xmath56 and @xmath52 becomes a free parameter .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath57 , all constant parameters of the power - law solution are fixed by @xmath58 the positive definiteness of the right - hand side of the second condition in restricts the value of @xmath50 , @xmath59 in order to have an accelerating unverse , we also have a constraint , @xmath60 , from the first relation in . therefore , there are two possibilities for the parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 or @xmath64 @xmath62 @xmath65 . in the case @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 we have the first relation in , while in the @xmath64 @xmath62 @xmath65 case we have the second one in .",
    "then the range of @xmath53 for both cases can be expressed in terms of @xmath44 as follows , @xmath66 in the case @xmath45 , @xmath53 is fixed to unity .",
    "therefore , there is no inflation in this case . in this paper , we consider @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 case .    the power - law solutions in and are special solutions of the background equations of since we started from a special ansatz in obtaining the solutions .",
    "for this reason , it is understandable that one can not obtain the solution by taking @xmath67 in .",
    "that is , these two solutions satisfy different initial conditions in the @xmath67 limit .",
    "the general solution under the exponential - type potential for the single scalar field model was obtained in @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the slow - roll inflation with a potential satisfying the slow - roll approximations , @xmath68 to reflect these approximations , we introduce the slow - roll parameters , @xmath69 with the approximations in ( [ sr_approx ] ) , the background equations of motion of ( [ back_eom ] ) reduce to @xmath70 where @xmath71 for the case .",
    "the background dynamics of @xmath23 is governed by the two papameters @xmath0 and @xmath44 as well as the shape of potential @xmath72 .",
    "-foldings for the quadratic potential @xmath73 on the parameter space of @xmath0 and @xmath44 .",

    "for a fixed value of @xmath0 , the number of @xmath78-foldings decreases with increasing @xmath44 since the @xmath44-dependent term only appears in the denominator in . for concreteness",

    "however , the sign of @xmath85 determines the negative or positive contributions to the number of @xmath78-foldings . therefore",
    ", there is a critical point for the value of @xmath44 near @xmath86 the scalar field @xmath23 is varying as the cosmic time evolves .",
    "however , it is almost a constant at the early stage of the inflation , according to our assumption of the slow - roll inflation . for this reason",
    ", the value of @xmath44 in can be the critical point .",
    "the behaviors of the @xmath78-foldings for the quadratic potential are given graphically in fig.1 .",
    "one of the well - known properties of the slow - roll inflation ( @xmath55 ) is that there exists a late time attractor behavior , such that the time evolution of the inflaton scalar field becomes independent of the initial conditions . in our case ( @xmath87 ) in , the time evolution behavior at the early time is different from that of the single field case due to some contributions of the @xmath0-dependent terms in .",
    "as time goes on , however , the contributions become smaller quickly since those terms are proportional to @xmath88 . therefore",

    ", we have used the relations , @xmath191 the expansions of power spectrums in are only valid in the range of @xmath0 , @xmath192 in @xmath67 limit , the power spectrums @xmath193 and @xmath194 at the horizon crossing point in become those of the single field case .",
    "finally , the spectral indices for @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the large scale limit ( @xmath183 ) are given by @xmath195 if we take ( [ alpharange ] ) into account , we find the last terms in @xmath196 and @xmath197 are of the order of @xmath162 and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "these imply that while the curvature perturbation is nearly scale invariant , the isocurvature perturbation is proportional to the inverse square of the comoving wavenumber .",
    "the running of the scalar spectral index is given by @xmath199 the leading term becomes of the order of @xmath162 from ( [ psofrs ] ) and .",
    "recent planck  @xcite and wmap nine - year  @xcite data show @xmath200 with the pivot scale @xmath201 ( planck ) and @xmath202 ( wmap ) , respectively . since @xmath203 and @xmath204 , the sign of the running of the spectral index in ( [ running ] ) is consistent with the observations .",
    "however , to give some restriction on the value of @xmath0 we need more investigations using a specific potential of the single scalar field .",
    "we leave these issues for future work .      using the relations and ,",
    "we obtain @xmath205 then the linearized perturbed equation for the tensor mode , up to the leading order in the slow - roll parameters and the gradient constant @xmath0 , can be written as @xmath206 u_{t } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 interestingly , the tensor mode has _ the same lower bound _ of the comoving wavenumber with that of the scalar mode in .    choosing the initial condition with a positive frequency mode , just like in the initial state of the scalar mode ,",
    "we obtain the following solutions in the large scale limit ( @xmath208 ) , @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 is an independent gaussian random variable and has the same properties with those defined in .    with these solutions , the power spectrum for the tensor modes @xmath136",
    "is obtained as @xmath212 where we used @xmath213 and the factor `` 2 '' comes from the two polarization states .",
    "we also used the quantities at the horizon crossing point ( @xmath214 ) , @xmath215 the spectral index for tensor modes and tensor - to - scalar ratio are given by @xmath216",
    "in this paper , we studied the cosmological properties of a multi - field inflation model in which we considered the single field and an additional triad of scalar fields with a non - minimal coupling which is dependent on the single scalar field .",
    "as a special background solution , we considered spatially dependent linear profiles for the triad of scalar fields , while the single scalar field depends on the cosmic time only .",
    "due to this linear property , all components of the energy momentum tensor evolve homogeneously and isotropically on the background frw metric .",
    "for this reason , we can regard the background evolution as that of the single field inflation in the presence of a matter with an equation of state @xmath217 , which spreads to the whole space .",
    "however , there appeared one more scalar degree of freedom from the triad of scalar fields in the perturbation level .",
    "therefore , our model is different form the single field inflation model in some cosmological background .    for the exponential - type potential , we found an exact solution describing the power - law inflation , as in the case of the single field inflation model .",
    "we also investigated the properties of the background evolution under the assumption of the slow - roll inflation .",
    "the background behaviors of the slow - roll inflation are determined by the two parameters @xmath44 and @xmath0 which are associated with the non - minimal coupling and the gradient constant of the triad of scalar fields , respectively .",
    "we have drawn contour lines of the @xmath78-foldings for the quadratic potential on the parameter space of @xmath44 and @xmath0 in fig.1 .",
    "we also investigated the properties of the scalar and tensor perturbations for the slow - roll inflation with vanishing @xmath44 and small @xmath0 . in the scalar fluctuations ,",
    "there are two physical modes , @xmath158 and @xmath159 originating from the scalar field and the triad of scalar fields respectively in the spatially flat gauge .",
    "the two scalar modes are decoupled from each other and have the form of sasaki - mukhanov equation in the leading contribution of @xmath0 .",
    "we found that there exists _ an observational lower bound _ of the comoving wave number , @xmath218 , to have a well - defined initial quantum state for @xmath158 with a positive energy eigenvalue .",
    "we also obtained the power spectrums and the corresponding spectral indices for the comoving curvature and isocurvature perturbations . if we compare our results for the power spectrum with those of the single field inflation model , the @xmath0-dependent terms are always proportional to @xmath219 . due to this reason ,",
    "the spectral indices for the curvature and isocurvature perturbations have the contribution of @xmath219 terms as well .",
    "as is already well - known , the isocurvature perturbation in the single field inflation model is vanishing in the large scale .",
    "however , the power spectrum for the isocurvature perturbation is non - vanishing and has contributions from both @xmath158 and @xmath159 modes in our model .",
    "we also implemented the same analysis for the tensor perturbation .",
    "we found _ the same lower bound _ of the comoving wavenumber in the tensor mode .    in the case of non - vanishing @xmath44 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 modes are coupled with each other .",
    "then it is difficult to obtain analytic solutions , unlike the case of @xmath45 . as we saw in the analysis of the background evolution , the value of @xmath44 changes the behaviors of the cosmological evolution significantly .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the value @xmath44 may have some important roles in the perturbations as well .",
    "we leave the analysis of the nonvanishing @xmath44 for future work .",
    "one important difference between the single field model and ours is the existence of the isocurvature perturbation in our model , which originates from the spatial gradient of the background solution .",
    "one may also test whether the nonvanishing spatial gradient can be a source of the cosmological non - gaussianity . in the solid inflation model  @xcite",
    ", the authors obtained unusually large non - gaussianity , @xmath220 with sound speed @xmath221 .",
    "since we are considering the inflaton field in addition to the triad of the scalar fields , we can expect that the non - gaussianity behaviors of our model is different from that of the solid inflation model",
    ". it will be interesting if we compare the non - gaussianity behavior of our model with those of the solid inflation model and the recent observational data .",
