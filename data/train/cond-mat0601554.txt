    "most liquids become denser when cooled and more viscous when compressed . in contrast",
    ", water becomes less dense when cooled ( density , or thermodynamic , anomaly ) and its diffusivity increases upon pressurization ( diffusion , or dynamic , anomaly ) .",
    "these anomalies , which disappear at high enough temperature and pressure , are not unique to water .",
    "other liquids with local tetrahedral order ( e.g. , silica and silicon ) also exhibit thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies  @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of these anomalies is the tendency of these substances to form local open structures not present in simple liquids .",
    "however , establishing a precise and quantitative link between the microscopic structure and the dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies of tetrahedral liquids has proved elusive until recently .",
    "errington and debenedetti  @xcite ( ed ) studied the relation between microscopic structure and the anomalies of liquid water by introducing two simple metrics : a translational order parameter @xmath4  @xcite , quantifying the tendency of molecule pairs to adopt preferential separations , and an orientational order parameter @xmath11  @xcite , quantifying the extent to which a molecule and its four nearest neighbors adopt a tetrahedral local structure , as in the case of hexagonal ice . a useful way of investigating structural order in liquids is to map state points into the @xmath12 plane .",
    "such a representation was introduced by torquato and coworkers  @xcite , who first applied it to sphere packings and referred to it as an order map .",
    "ed used the order map to investigate structural order in water  @xcite . because of the distinctive features discovered in that study , in what follows we refer to water - like order maps as the ed order map . using molecular dynamics simulation of the spc / e  @xcite model",
    ", ed found that the state points accessible to liquid water define a two - dimensional region in the @xmath12 plane , meaning that in general @xmath4 and @xmath11 are independently variable in liquid water ( i.e. , equilibrium state paths exist along which one order metric varies while the other does not ) .",
    "they also found a dome - shaped region in the ( @xmath13 ) plane within which isothermal compression leads to a decrease in @xmath4 and @xmath11 .",
    "this _ decrease _ in order upon compression constitutes a structural anomaly : simple liquids , in contrast , always become more ordered upon compression .",
    "ed further found that dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies define nested domes in the ( @xmath2 ) plane : the structural anomalies dome contains the dynamic anomalies dome , which in turn contains the thermodynamic anomalies dome .",
    "this means that whenever the thermal expansion coefficient is negative , the diffusivity must necessarily increase upon isothermal compression .",
    "ed showed that all state points exhibiting structural , dynamic or thermodynamic anomalies define a line on the ( @xmath14 ) plane , meaning that when water exhibits anomalous behavior , its translational and orientational order metrics become strictly coupled .",
    "this is clear evidence of the relationship between structure and water anomalies .",
    "et al . _ subsequently found qualitatively similar behavior in molten silica s order map  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of silica , it was found that state points corresponding to anomalous behavior define a narrow stripe in the ( @xmath14 ) plane instead of a strict line .",
    "furthermore , unlike in water , the region of dynamic anomalies was found to contain that of structural anomalies .    for simple spherically - symmetric liquids , including hard spheres  @xcite and lennard - jones  @xcite",
    "the order map was found to be a positively - sloped line in the ( @xmath14 ) plane , indicating that translational and orientational order are always strictly and positively correlated . in this case , of course , the appropriate metric for orientational order does not measure tetrahedrality ; rather , the bond - orientational order parameter introduced by steinhardt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was used . an important result from these studies",
    "is the fact that the order map for the lennard - jones system above its critical density is identical to that of hard spheres .",
    "furthermore , in these simple systems that do not exhibit thermodynamic or dynamic anomalies , compression always leads to an increase in the order metrics .    in 1970",
    "hemmer and stell  @xcite showed that in fluids interacting via pairwise - additive , spherically - symmetric potentials consisting of a hard core plus an attractive tail , softening of the repulsive core can produce additional phase transitions .",
    "this pioneering study elicited a considerable body of work on so - called core - softened potentials @xcite .",
    "this generic term denotes continuous potentials with inflections in the repulsive core  @xcite , discontinuous potentials with the core softened by shoulders or ramps @xcite , or lattice models with nearest - neighbor attraction and next - nearest neighbor repulsion  @xcite .",
    "it is now well - established that such potentials can generate water - like density and diffusion anomalies @xcite .",
    "this important finding implies that strong orientational interactions , such as those that exist in water and silica , are not a necessary condition for a liquid to have thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies .",
    "the above discussion implies the existence of two well - defined classes of liquids : simple and water - like .",
    "the former which interact via spherically - symmetric non - softened potentials , do not exhibit thermodynamic nor dynamic anomalies , and their order map is a line . in water - like liquids , interactions are orientation - dependent ; these liquids exhibit dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies , and their order map is in general two - dimensional but becomes linear ( or quasi - linear ) when the liquid exhibits structural , dynamic or thermodynamic anomalies .",
    "intermediate between these well - defined extremes is the class of core - softened liquids , which interact via spherically - symmetric potentials but can also exhibit water - like thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies .",
    "two questions arise naturally from this emerging taxonomy of liquid behavior .",
    "first , is structural order in core - softened fluids hard - sphere or water - like ?",
    "second , is it possible to seamlessly connect the range of liquid behavior from hard spheres to water - like by a simple and common potential , simply by changing a physical parameter ?",
    "in a recent study  @xcite we addressed the first question .",
    "we showed that a core - softened potential with two characteristic length scales not only can gives rise to water - like diffusive and density anomalies , but also to an ed water - like order map .",
    "this implies that orientational interactions are not necessary in order for a liquid to have structural anomalies . in this work",
    "we address the second question .",
    "specifically , we use the ratio of characteristic length scales as a control parameter to investigate the evolution of dynamic , thermodynamic and structural anomalies . in this manner",
    "we show that the family of tunable spherically - symmetric potentials so generated evolves continuously between water - like and hard sphere behavior . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that essential aspects of the wide range of liquid behavior encompassed by hard spheres and tetrahedrally - coordinated network - formers can be systematically traversed by varying a single control parameter .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "sections ii , iii , and iv provide details on the interaction potential , simulation method , and order parameters , respectively .",
    "results are presented in section v. conclusions and some suggestions for future work are provided in section vi .",
    "we perform discrete md simulations to study the equation of state , diffusion coefficient and structural order as measured by the ed order map , for a fluid whose particles interact via a pairwise - additive , spherically - symmetric potential that gives rise to both thermodynamic and dynamic water - like anomalies .",
    "the model was introduced by jagla  @xcite ; the potential energy @xmath15 between a pair of particles separated by a distance @xmath16 is given by ( see fig .  [ ramppotential ] ) .",
    "@xmath17 the shorter distance @xmath18 corresponds to the hard core , and the longer distance @xmath19 characterizes a softer repulsion range that can be overcome at high pressure .",
    "because of its shape , it is called the ramp potential .",
    "the constant slope of the ramp potential for @xmath20 keeps the force between particles @xmath21 constant , so the product of separation and force @xmath22 will decrease when the separation @xmath16 decreases .",
    "this satisfies the mathematical meaning of core - softening  @xcite and under these conditions the thermodynamic ( density ) anomaly can be qualitatively explained by invoking the virial theorem  @xcite .    of interest",
    "is the ratio between the two characteristic length scales , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath23 which can vary between 0 and 1 . ref .",

    "we also investigate systems with different number of particles ( @xmath33 ) and confirm that the results do not depend on the number of particles .",
    "the simulation ranges of temperature and density fully cover the region where density , diffusion and structural anomalies occur .",
    "the translational order parameter  @xcite is defined as , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the radial distance @xmath16 scaled by the mean interparticle distance @xmath36 , @xmath28 is the number density , @xmath37 is the pair correlation function , and @xmath38 a numerical cutoff .",

    "the modulations in @xmath37 persist over large distances , causing @xmath4 to grow . between these limits , @xmath4 will change as a consequence of the dependence of @xmath42 upon @xmath30 and @xmath28 .",

    "moreover , the number of bonds associated to each particle is not fixed , but instead it changes with temperature and pressure .",

    "the inner peak at @xmath55 , which is broad and of modest height at @xmath58 , becomes sharper and more pronounced upon further compression .",
    "interestingly , structural changes brought about by compression become progressively longer - ranged as @xmath0 increases .",
    "thus , for @xmath24 and 2/7 , the major changes in @xmath42 involve the development of structure at length scales @xmath59 associated with the growth of the inner peak at @xmath55 .",

    "[ top ] ) . upon further compression",
    ", the growth of @xmath71 above 1 eventually contributes additional area to the integral of @xmath70 , causing @xmath4 to increase .",
    "this qualitative behavior of @xmath4 is similar for @xmath72 and 4/7 , and is more pronounced at low @xmath30 . for @xmath61 ,",
    "close to the hard sphere limit , the pronounced growth of the inner peak upon compression gives rise to a monotonic density dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath73 is clearly transitional , with non - monotonic behavior at low temperature changing to hard - sphere - like monotonic growth of t upon compression at high temperature .",
    "orientational order , as measured by @xmath5 , shows a pronounced dependence on @xmath0 , illustrated in figs .",
    "[ tq - d](a2)(e2 ) . when @xmath24 ( no hard core ) , @xmath5 increases monotonically with density for all @xmath30 . when @xmath63 , @xmath5 begins to exhibit non - monotonic behavior upon compression",
    "for this particular value of @xmath0 the trend is very mild , and is best described as a virtual insensitivity of @xmath5 to compression , except for an initial increase at low enough densities . for @xmath10 and 5/7 ,",
    "orientational order exhibits a marked non - monotonic dependence on density , especially at low temperatures .",
    "when coupled with the corresponding behavior of @xmath4 , this corresponds to a water - like structural anomaly , whereby both order metrics decrease upon isothermal compression .",
    "when @xmath61 , which is close to the hard sphere value ( @xmath7 ) , orientational order increases monotonically upon compression .",
    "thus , there exists a narrow interval of @xmath0 within which the ramp fluid shows water - like structural order , whereas in the pure ramp ( @xmath24 ) and quasi - hard - sphere limits ( @xmath74 ) @xmath5 behaves conventionally upon compression .",
    "cross - plotting the order metrics against each other generates the order map , whose evolution as a function of @xmath0 is depicted in fig .",

    "= 2/7 , the barely discernible non - monotonic dependence of @xmath5 on density gives rise to loops along isotherms .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath5 is fully developed for @xmath0 = 4/7 .",
    "this gives rise to an order map with states corresponding to structural anomalies lying on a narrow stripe of the order map adjacent to the boundary between the accessible and inaccessible regions .",
    "this behavior is strikingly analogous to that of water .",
    "the insensitivity of structural order to temperature , a distinguishing feature of hard spheres , can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ ordermap](e ) by the virtual collapse of all isotherms in the @xmath0 = 6/7 case .",
    "the transition from water - like to hard sphere order map occurs in the narrow interval @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath0 = 5/7 , there is a clear evolution from water - like low-@xmath30 behavior ( @xmath76 ) to hard - sphere - like high-@xmath30 behavior ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we now discuss the regions of the phase diagram where structural , dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies occur . in water",
    "@xcite , structural , dynamic , and thermodynamic anomalies occur as nested domes in the ( @xmath2 ) or ( @xmath3 ) planes .",
    "structural anomalies define the outer dome , within which isothermal compression results in a decrease of both translational and orientational order .",
    "dynamic anomalies define an intermediate dome , lying entirely within the structural anomalies dome , and within which isothermal compression leads to an increase in the diffusion coefficient .",
    "thermodynamic anomalies define the innermost dome , within which water expands when cooled isobarically . in silica",
    "@xcite , dynamic anomalies define the outer dome , structural anomalies the intermediate dome , and thermodynamic anomalies define the inner dome .",
    "thus , in both cases negative thermal expansion implies also diffusive and structural anomalies , but in silica diffusive anomalies occur over a broader range of densities and temperatures than structural anomalies , the opposite being true in water .",
    "[ ptphase ] shows the loci of dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies for three values of @xmath0 .",
    "similar to water and silica , in ramp fluids thermodynamic anomalies occur over a narrower temperature and density range than dynamic anomalies . in other words , if a ramp fluid is at a state point where it expands when cooled isobarically , its diffusion coefficient necessarily increases upon isothermal compression .",
    "it can be seen that upon increasing @xmath0 , the range of temperatures where anomalies occurs shrinks , whereas the upper limit of density ( or pressure ) where anomalies can occur increases .",
    "the shrinking of the temperature range where anomalies occur follows from the fact that increasing @xmath0 makes the fluid progressively hard - sphere - like , and there are no anomalies in a hard sphere fluid .",
    "[ qttmddm ] shows the relationship between the loci of dynamic , thermodynamic and structural anomalies . in water ,",
    "the low - density and high - density branches of the dome of structural anomalies correspond to tetrahedrality maxima and translational order minima , respectively . for the pure ramp case ( @xmath0 = 0 ) , the orientational order increases monotonically with density over the range of temperatures explored here .",
    "accordingly , as seen in fig .",
    "[ qttmddm](a ) , the dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies domes are bounded by loci of translational order extrema ( maxima : line c ; minima : line a ) . between lines c and a , compression leads to a decrease in translational order . for @xmath0",
    "= 4/7 and 5/7 , the locus of orientational order maxima ( b ) provides a low - density bound to the existence of thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies .",
    "thus , for these two values of @xmath0 , ramp fluids exhibit a water - like cascade of anomalies ( structural , dynamic , thermodynamic ) . for @xmath63 , @xmath5 maxima",
    "are barely discernible and the two order metrics are only weakly coupled to each other .",
    "accordingly , the locus of weak orientational order maxima ( b ) is not a relevant indicator of dynamic or thermodynamic anomalies .",
    "in this work we have investigated thermodynamic , dynamic and structural anomalies in ramp potential fluids , as a function of the ratio @xmath0 of length scales corresponding to the inner hard core , and to the outer edge of the ramp . we find that thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies exist for @xmath0 = 0 , 2/7 , 4/7 and 5/7 , but not for = 6/7 . as in water and silica ,",
    "the loci of anomalies form nested domes in the ( @xmath2 ) plane , inside which the thermal expansion coefficient is negative ( inner dome ) and the diffusivity increases upon compression ( outer dome ) .",
    "the limit @xmath0 = 1 corresponds to hard spheres , and the absence of anomalies for @xmath0= 6/7 indicates approach to hard sphere behavior .",
    "the order map of this family of ramp fluids is water - like at @xmath0 = 4/7 and hard - sphere - like at @xmath0 = 6/7 .",
    "thus , by varying the ratio of characteristic length scales , the family of ramp potentials spans the range of liquid behavior from hard spheres to water - like .",
    "these findings show that orientational interactions are not necessary for the existence of thermodynamic , dynamic , or structural anomalies .",
    "instead , water - like behavior apparently emerges in this spherically - symmetric family of fluids through the existence of two competing length scales .",
    "although thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies exist almost over the entire range of the control parameter , the combination of thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies plus a water - like order map occurs over a narrow range of @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a distinguishing feature of water is the fact that the ratio of radial distances to the first and second peaks of the oxygen - oxygen pair correlation function is not @xmath78 , as in simple liquids , but @xmath79 .",
    "this is close to 0.571 ( @xmath0 = 4/7 , the ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath19 that gives rise to water - like structural , dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies ) . in water",
    ", isothermal compression pushes molecules from the second shell towards the first shell , gradually filling the interstitial space  @xcite .",
    "likewise , in the ramp potential , isothermal compression pushes molecules from the soft core ( @xmath19 ) to the hard core ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "further work is needed to establish whether a ratio of competing length scales close to 0.6 is generally associated with water - like anomalies in other core - softened potentials , for example linear combinations of gaussian  @xcite potentials . in this work we used the terminology water - like to denote structural , diffusion , and density anomalies .",
    "the increase in water s isothermal compressibility upon isobaric cooling , another of this liquid s canonical anomalies , is also trivially captured by the ramp potential , because thermodynamic consistency arguments  @xcite mandate that the compressibility increase upon cooling whenever there exists a negatively - sloped locus of density maxima in the ( @xmath80 ) plane .",
    "the ramp potential , when supplemented by explicit  @xcite or mean - field attractions  @xcite , gives rise to liquid - liquid immiscibility and a critical point distinct from the one associated with the vapor - liquid transition .",
    "a liquid - liquid transition has been observed experimentally in phosphorus  @xcite , n - butanol  @xcite and triphenyl phosphite  @xcite , and strong experimental evidence consistent with liquid - liquid immiscibility also exists for water @xcite .",
    "computer simulations of silicon  @xcite , silica  @xcite , carbon  @xcite and water  @xcite also indicate the presence of a liquid - liquid transition . a systematic study of the effects of @xmath0 and the ratio of characteristic energies ( @xmath31 and the attractive well depth ) on the existence of a liquid - liquid transition , the positive or negative slope of the line of first - order liquid - liquid transitions in the ( @xmath80 ) plane , and the relationship ,",
    "if any @xcite , between the liquid - liquid transition and density anomalies , would shed important new light on the phenomenon of liquid polyamorphism  @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that strong orientation - dependent interactions underlie many of the distinctive properties of associating , network - forming liquids such as water .",
    "atomic liquids , on the other hand , exhibit simpler behavior , and in particular do not show structural , thermodynamic , or dynamic anomalies of the type discussed here . in this work we have shown that key properties of these apparently distinct categories of liquids can be bridged systematically by varying the ratio of two length scales in a family of spherically - symmetric potentials in which orientation - dependent interactions are absent by design .",
    "what other spherically - symmetric potentials , in addition to those possessing competing length scales , may give rise to water - like anomalies , is among the interesting questions arising from this study that we will pursue in future work .",

    "<S> the order map evolves from water - like behavior to hard - sphere - like behavior upon varying @xmath0 between 4/7 and 6/7 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we traverse the range of liquid behavior encompassed by hard spheres ( @xmath7 ) and water - like ( @xmath8 ) with a family of tunable spherically - symmetric potentials by simply varying the ratio of hard to soft - core diameters . although dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies occur almost across the entire range @xmath9 , water - like structural anomalies ( i.e. , decrease in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 upon compression and strictly correlated @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the anomalous region ) occur only around @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> water - like anomalies in structure , dynamics and thermodynamics arise solely due to the existence of two length scales , orientation - dependent interactions being absent by design . </S>"
