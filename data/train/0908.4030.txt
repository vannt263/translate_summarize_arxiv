    "it is widely accepted today that the deconfinement transition in pure su(@xmath4 ) gauge theories at finite temperature is driven by the dynamics of center vortices @xcite . in the vortex picture of confinement ,",
    "wilson loops acquire a disordering phase factor from every vortex that they link with .",
    "the area law for timelike wilson loops in the pure gauge theory comes from the percolation of spacelike vortex sheets in the confined phase .",
    "their free energies have been measured over the deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature in the @xmath5 dimensional pure su(2 ) gauge theory from ratios of partition functions with t hooft s twisted boundary conditions in temporal planes , forcing odd numbers of @xmath6 center vortices through those planes , over the periodic ensemble with even numbers @xcite . a kramers - wannier duality is then observed by comparing the behaviour of these center vortices with that of t hooft s electric fluxes which yield the free energies of static charges in a well - defined ( uv - regular ) way  @xcite , with boundary conditions to mimic the presence of mirror ( anti)charges in neighbouring volumes .",
    "this duality follows that between the wilson loops of the 3-dimensional @xmath6-gauge theory and the 3d - ising spins , reflecting the universality of the center symmetry breaking transition .",
    "here we study the vortex free energies of pure su(2 ) in @xmath1 dimensions over the deconfinement transition because the relevant interface free energies of its universal partner , the self - dual ising model in 2 dimensions , are all known analytically .",
    "moreover , the vortex free energies in @xmath1 dimensions are much cheaper to simulate and discretisation effects vanish more rapidly than in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "together these reasons allow for numerical studies of much higher precision .",
    "in sections 2 and 3 we briefly outline the basic concepts and our numerical procedure .",
    "our results are presented in sec .",
    "4 . these include the precise determination of the critical coupling for various lattices with up to @xmath7 sites in the euclidean time direction , an analysis of the finite volume corrections and a brief comparison with the corrections to scaling in the 2d ising model .",
    "we then determine how the critical coupling depends on @xmath3 , including @xmath8 corrections , and use this result to derive how the lattice coupling @xmath2 varies with temperature for a given fixed @xmath3 around the deconfinement transition .",
    "this is needed , for example , for a detailed finite - size scaling analysis of the vortex free energies in 2 + 1 dimensional su(2 ) @xcite .",
    "for pure su(2 ) gauge theory , t hooft s twisted boundary conditions fix the total number of @xmath9 vortices modulo 2 through each plane of a finite box @xcite .",
    "twist in a plane corresponds to an ensemble with an odd number of @xmath9 vortices through that plane .    in a @xmath10 euclidean box , we can distinguish between two types of twist .",
    "magnetic twist is defined in the purely spatial plane and forces vortices that run along the temporal direction .",
    "they may spread independently of the temperature @xmath11 and play no role in the deconfinement transition : their free energy is expected to vanish in the thermodynamic limit at all temperatures which has been demonstrated explicitly in @xmath5 dimensions @xcite . on the other hand , vortices from twist in the two temporal planes",
    "are squeezed more and more as @xmath11 is increased .",
    "they may no longer spread arbitrarily and this is what drives the phase transition .    in this paper",
    "we re interested in configurations with a twist in one of the temporal planes .",
    "if we denote the partition function of this ensemble by @xmath12 , its free energy per @xmath11 is defined via the ratio @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the partition function of the periodic ensemble .    as we approach the thermodynamic limit , @xmath15 converges to a non - trivial fixed point at the critical temperature .",
    "it can therefore be used as a phenomenological coupling in the same manner as the binder cumulant .",
    "typically , one uses the pairwise intersections of binder cumulant curves from different lattice sizes to estimate the critical coupling or temperature @xcite . using a ratio of partition functions in this way",
    "was proposed by hasenbusch for the 3d ising model @xcite .    here",
    "we can go a step further . since su(2 ) in 2 + 1 dimensions is in the same universality class as the 2d ising model , the the value of @xmath15 at the fixed point is exactly known .",
    "a single temporal twist in su(2 ) corresponds to a single anti - periodic direction on a @xmath16 ising lattice .",
    "this forces an odd number of spin interfaces perpendicular to the anti periodic direction .",
    "the corresponding ratio of partition functions @xmath17 in the ising model gives the free energy of the system in the same way as equation ( [ eq : part ratio ] ) . in both cases , configurations of minimum action / energy dominate the partition function .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit , the free energy of a single spacelike vortex in su(2 ) is identified with the free energy of a single interface in the 2d square ising model at the respective critical points .",
    "this universal value is given by @xcite @xmath18        for su(2 ) on the lattice , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of sites in the time direction and the lattice spacing @xmath21 depends on the coupling .",
    "so the critical temperature @xmath22 corresponds to a critical lattice coupling @xmath23 for each @xmath20 .",
    "the subscript @xmath24 reminds us that we only have a strict phase transition and hence critical coupling in the limit of infinite spatial volume .",
    "still , the intersection of @xmath15 with the universal value ( [ eq : universal ratio ] ) gives a reliable estimate of @xmath25 provided that the spatial length @xmath26 is large enough .",
    "this will be more precise in general than the estimates obtained via pairwise intersections .",

    "we assume a finite size scaling ( fss ) behaviour of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a correction to scaling exponent that should be approximately independent of @xmath20 , and @xmath29 is exactly known from the 2d ising model .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 , and we define a pseudo - critical coupling in a finite volume , @xmath31 , by the requirement that the corrections to the universal value in ( [ eq : ratio fss ] ) vanish",
    ". these estimates then converge to the infinite volume critical coupling @xmath25 as @xmath32 here , the coeffiecient @xmath33 is an @xmath20 dependent fit parameter .    for notational simplicity we will hereafter drop the subscript @xmath24 on the critical coupling .",
    "unless @xmath34 is explicitly mentioned , @xmath35 refers to the infinite volume limit .",
    "we have used a variety of spatial lattice sizes and the above scaling formula ( [ eq : ratio fss ] ) to first find @xmath31 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 with high precision , in order to then determine the corresponding @xmath38 from fitting the volume dependence of @xmath39 by ( [ eq : beta scaling ] ) .",
    "twist was implemented in the usual way @xcite .",
    "we kept periodic boundary conditions but flipped the coupling @xmath40 of a stack of plaquettes perpendicular to the plane of the twist .",
    "in other words , we introduced a @xmath9 dirac string that is closed by lattice periodicity .",
    "the result is a transformation of the usual wilson action .    in practice",
    ", the overlap of @xmath41 and @xmath14 is poor . to overcome this we interpolated in the number of flipped plaquettes using the snake algorithm of ref .",
    "this was combined with the other variance reduction tricks therein .",
    "for each combination of @xmath20 and @xmath34 we performed simulations for @xmath42 values of @xmath43 around the intersection of @xmath15 with the exact ising value ( [ eq : universal ratio ] ) .",
    "random errors were estimated via the boostrap method . since su(2 )",
    "lattice gauge theory is less computationally expensive in 2 + 1 dimensions than in 3 + 1 dimensions , we were able to perform a very large number of measurements .",
    "@xmath44 million configurations were used for each @xmath43 , depending on the lattice size .",
    "it turns out that the free energy @xmath45 has less curvature than @xmath15 near the critical point , so it s a better candidate for linear approximation .",

    ", we carefully chose the size of our fitting windows .",
    "for each @xmath20 , we performed precise measurements of @xmath53 in a quadratic fitting window for one or more of our smallest lattices . by writing @xmath53 as a function of the finite size scaling variable @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the reduced temperature and @xmath56 are the correlation lengths for @xmath57 with @xmath29 for the 2d ising model , we were able to translate this data to larger @xmath34 .",

    "@xcite that the only irrelevant operators that appear in the 2d nearest neighbour ising model are those due to the lattice breaking of rotational symmetry .",
    "this may be tested on a triangular 2d lattice where the leading irrelevant operator to break rotational invariance leads to @xmath83 instead , while the leading rotationally invariant operator would give an isotropic correction to scaling with @xmath84 in either case @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "our correction exponent for su(2 ) is clearly at odds with @xmath85 . in this case",

    "whether such non - integral correction exponents could arise in other ferromagentic models of this class , and whether the corresponding correction amplitudes happened to vanish identically in the exactly solvable pure ising model , see @xcite .",
