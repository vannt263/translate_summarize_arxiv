    "identifying the stars that harbor circumstellar disks within young clusters and associations is an essential step in using disks to study star and planet formation . for instance",
    ", thorough surveys for disks provide well - defined samples of targets for detailed measurements of disk properties .",
    "in addition , by comparing the prevalence of disks in different evolutionary stages within a given cluster and among clusters across a range of ages , one can estimate the lifetimes and clearing timescales of disks , which in turn constrain models of disk evolution and planet formation .",
    "the best available tool for disk surveys has been mid - infrared ( ir ) imaging with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "_ spitzer _ has offered the sensitivity to detect the photospheres of young brown dwarfs in nearby clusters ( @xmath10  pc ) , the field of view to efficiently map these clusters ( @xmath11 ) , the angular resolution to resolve most of their members ( @xmath12 ) , and a suite of mid - ir filters that could roughly classify the evolutionary stages of disks ( 3.624  ) .",
    "although _ spitzer _ has focused on relatively compact clusters ( @xmath13  deg@xmath14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , it has also imaged more widely distributed populations in areas as large as @xmath1  deg@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the upper scorpius subgroup in the scorpius - centaurus ob association is an attractive target for disk surveys .",
    "it contains one of the nearest and richest populations of young stars ( @xmath15165  pc , @xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making it possible to measure disk properties down to low stellar masses with good statistical accuracy .",
    "perhaps most importantly , upper sco is at an age where both primordial disks and second - generation debris disks are abundant @xcite , and thus can potentially provide vital constraints on disk evolution .",
    "most studies have adopted a mean age of 5  myr for upper sco @xcite , but @xcite recently derived a significantly older value of 11  myr , which affects the timescales of disk evolution derived from any census of disks in the region .",
    "the ages of upper sco and its neighboring subgroups remain a subject of debate @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer _ has been used to identify and classify disks in upper sco based on mid - ir photometry @xcite and to study the mineralogy of dust in those disks with mid - ir spectroscopy @xcite . in one of the most widely - cited results from the _ spitzer _ data",
    ", @xcite found that , in a sample of @xmath17 members , nearly all of the stars more massive than the sun have lost their primordial disks while a significant fraction of the low - mass stars ( @xmath181/5 ) have retained them , indicating that disk lifetimes may be longer at lower stellar masses .",
    "however , because upper sco is spread across a large area ( @xmath19  deg@xmath14 ) , _ spitzer _ imaged members individually rather than through a map of the association , and only a subset of the stellar population was observed . as a result ,",
    "the potential of the association for constraining the properties of disks was not fully exploited .",
    "the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , * ? ? ? * ) has presented an opportunity to significantly improve the census of disks in upper sco . in 2010 ,",
    "the satellite imaged the entire sky at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  , providing mid - ir photometry for the areas of upper sco that were not observed by _",
    "spitzer_. although they have lower sensitivity and angular resolution than _ spitzer _ images , the data do detect every known member of upper sco ( that is resolved ) in the most sensitive bands , including the brown dwarfs .",
    "photometry has already been used to search for disks around members of upper sco at b , a , and f types @xcite and mid- to late - m types @xcite .    to obtain the most thorough census of disks in upper sco that is possible with available data",
    ", we have compiled all photometry between 324  from both _ spitzer _ and for all known members of the association ( section  [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "we use these data to identify the members that exhibit significant mid - ir excesses ( section  [ sec : exc ] ) and to estimate the evolutionary stages of the detected disks ( section  [ sec : class ] ) .",
    "we then measure the distribution of excesses as a function of spectral type , wavelength , disk class , and excess size and discuss the resulting implications for disk evolution ( section  [ sec : global ] ) .",
    "to characterize the population of disks in upper sco , we began by constructing a list of all published sources that are likely to be members of the association based on proper motions or diagnostics of youth .",
    "we also have included new members that we have uncovered through an ongoing survey of the association .",
    "the basis for inclusion in our membership catalog will be described in a separate study ( k. luhman , in preparation ) .",
    "we have treated known binaries as single sources if they are unresolved by both the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , secondaries that have been resolved only by high - resolution imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ or adaptive optics do not receive separate entries in our catalog of members @xcite .",
    "our resulting list of known members of upper sco contains 863 objects .",
    "we present their names and spectral types in table  [ tab : all ] .",
    "our compilation of spectral classifications is not fully exhaustive ; additional measurements have been reported in the literature for some of the stars , particularly at earlier types , but they generally agree with the types in table  [ tab : all ] .      for our census of disks in upper sco , we make use of images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  obtained with",

    "we report a tentative measurement for this star , but it is excluded from the analysis in this paper .",
    "@xcite noted that their 24  data for several additional stars were unreliable because of extended emission .",
    "based on visual inspection of the images , we find that these stars are point sources that are sufficiently bright compared to spatial variations in the background emission so that our aperture photometry should be reasonably accurate .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that our 24  data for these stars agree with the fluxes expected from the photospheres .",

    "we have applied this technique to the _ spitzer _ and photometry in upper sco to identify the members that have disks . to detect and measure excess emission for each member",

    "because of its richness and moderately advanced age , upper sco contains a large number of diskless stars , providing an accurate determination of the colors of young photospheres .",
    "since photospheric colors can vary with spectral type , we plot the ir colors in upper sco as a function of spectral type in figure  [ fig : pan ] .",

    "to better define the photospheric colors for l - type members of upper sco , we include in figure  [ fig : pan ] data for members of taurus that are later than m9 and that are diskless based on photometry at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "these data coincide with the bluest sources in upper sco and confirm the rapid increase in @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath30 beyond m9 .",

    "measurements of excesses at the latest types are also sensitive to uncertainties in spectral types because of the rapid increase in the photospheric colors .",

    "[ lhj2006 ] j163919.15 - 253409.9 has an excess in w2 but not [ 4.5 ] .",

    "[ lhj2007 ] j160918.69 - 222923.7 exhibits the same characteristics .",
    "mid - ir variability of this size is more likely to occur in stars with disks @xcite .",

    "the distribution of disk excesses as a function of parameters like wavelength , spectral type , cluster age , excess size , and disk class can provide insight into the evolution of disks . to characterize the distribution of excesses in upper sco , we begin by considering the fraction of members that exhibit excesses . in table  [ tab : fex ] and figure  [ fig : fex ] , we present the excess fraction as a function of spectral type for [ 4.5]/w2 , [ 8.0 ] , w3 , and [ 24]/w4 . to examine the evolution of primordial and debris disks separately ,",

    "therefore , the excess fractions for w3 and [ 24]/w4 in figure  [ fig : fex ] are shown only for spectral types in which nearly all of the known members are detected .",
    "for the joint [ 24]/w4 excess fraction , we adopt the [ 24 ] data when available , which have a high level of completeness down to a spectral type of m4 . among [ 24 ]",
    "non - detections earlier than m4 , six stars were not subject to extended emission or blending with other stars , and hence have useful limits on their photometry .",
    "the resulting constraints on @xmath48 $ ] indicate that these six stars have little , if any , excess emission , so we include them as non - excess stars in the [ 24]/w4 fraction . among stars that were not observed at [ 24 ] , the w4 images detected all but three stars earlier than m0 . therefore , we use the w4 data of members not observed at [ 24 ] and earlier than m0 in the [ 24]/w4 fraction .",
    "the three stars earlier than m0 with non - detections in w4 have sufficient constraints on this band to indicate that excesses are probably not present , so we count them as non - excess stars .",
    "it is unnecessary to impose such restrictions on the spectral types included in the excess fractions at [ 4.5 ] , w2 , and [ 8.0 ] since all known members were detected in these bands as long as they were observed ( by irac ) and not blended with another star .",
    "the be stars are excluded from these excess fractions .",
    "we first discuss the excess fractions for the full , transitional , and evolved disks ( i.e. , all primordial disks except for evolved transitional disks ) . for these disks ,",
    "the excess fractions are very low at a roughly uniform level as a function of spectral type for b through g types , and then increase with later types from k through m. this trend was discovered by @xcite , supported by additional data from @xcite for late - m members , and now is reinforced further with better number statistics .",
    "all of the bands in figure  [ fig : fex ] exhibit a similar dependence on spectral type , except that the excess fractions are slightly higher at longer wavelengths due to the presence of a small number of transitional disks . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "these data indicate that disk lifetimes are longer for stars at lower masses , providing more time for planet formation .",
    "we note that the excess fraction in [ 4.5]/w2 for the last bin in figure  [ fig : fex ] at m8l2 ( @xmath64  @xmath4 ) is uncertain because of the small number of objects and the rapidly changing photospheric colors , which makes it difficult to reliably identify excesses .",
    "in addition , since excesses in [ 4.5 ] are smaller at later types @xcite , the excess fraction in this band may significantly underestimate the disk fraction .",
    "longer wavelengths are needed for more robust detections of disk excesses for brown dwarfs , but the members at m8l2 were too faint for w3 and w4 photometry and were not observed at [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] .",
    "the disk fractions based on the data in figure  [ fig : fex ] are compared to similar measurements in younger clusters by @xcite .",
    "we now consider the excess fractions for the debris and evolved transitional disks .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we can not distinguish between these two types of disks with the mid - ir data , but most of the candidates at earlier spectral types are probably debris disks .",
    "it is unclear which class of disk dominates at later types . in figure",
    "[ fig : fex ] , the excess fraction for this sample increases rapidly with longer wavelengths .",
    "excesses in [ 4.5]/w2 are present for only a few stars , which may be some of the youngest debris disks in the association @xcite . the [ 24]/w4 fraction is highest for a stars ( @xmath65 ) , drops sharply for b stars ( @xmath66 ) , and decreases more gradually with later types , reaching 0.10.2 for g , k , and m stars .",
    "these trends are consistent with those previously found in smaller samples of [ 24 ] data in upper sco by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those studies investigated various aspects of their [ 24 ] data , and their results apply to our new measurements as well .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the rapid decrease in [ 24 ] fraction from a to b stars is expected because of increased ejection of dust grains by radiation pressure ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the [ 24]/w4 excess fractions at later spectral types are more difficult to interpret since they contain an unknown contribution from evolved transitional disks . in addition",
    ", many debris disks around late - type stars may be too cool to produce noticeable excesses in these bands .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also examined the evolution of debris disks by comparing the [ 24 ] excess fractions among upper sco and other associations and clusters across a range of ages ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our data have improved the statistical constraints on excess fractions and sizes in upper sco , particularly at m types , but an analysis like that from @xcite and @xcite for m stars is not possible because sufficiently complete samples of [ 24 ] data are available for only a few regions .",
    "the mid - ir colors of the members of a given star - forming region typically exhibit a gap between diskless stars and the bulk of the disk - bearing stars ( see section  [ sec : criteria ] ) .",
    "this trough in the distribution of excess sizes has been previously interpreted as evidence that once a disk has begun to clear to a certain degree , the remainder of the dust in the inner disk clears rapidly @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we examine the constraints on the clearing timescale that are provided by the distribution of excesses in upper sco .    because the contrast between a stellar photosphere and circumstellar disk increases at longer ir wavelengths , [ 24 ] and w4 offer the largest dynamic range in the sizes of excesses among the photometric bands that we have compiled for upper sco .",
    "given that the [ 24 ] observations are more sensitive than those at w4 , we choose the former for constructing the distribution of excesses . to characterize how this distribution changes with cluster age , we compare the data for upper sco to measurements of [ 24 ] in taurus @xcite .",
    "upper sco and taurus are the best available regions for such a comparison since they roughly bracket the ages of primordial disks ( @xmath13 and 10  myr ) , contain two of the richest and nearest samples of young stars , and have been thoroughly observed by _",
    "spitzer_. in particular , few other regions have [ 24 ] measurements that reach the stellar photospheres of low - mass stars , which is essential for fully sampling excesses across all sizes .",
    "since very few primordial disks are present among the early - type stars in upper sco , we exclude stars earlier than k0 from the distributions of @xmath48 $ ] excesses for upper sco and taurus .",
    "we also omit stars later than m5 since most of the diskless stars at these types are below the detection limits of the [ 24 ] images .",
    "roughly a dozen stars in each region at k5m5 are not detected in [ 24 ] and could have small excesses based on the limits on @xmath48 $ ] . as a result ,",
    "the distributions of excesses that we construct are biased slightly against small excesses .",

    "the two distributions exhibit similar troughs at @xmath57)\\sim0.5$]3 .",
    "most observations of other young clusters at [ 24 ] are less complete at low excesses or consider smaller numbers of stars , but they are generally consistent with gaps of this kind @xcite . meanwhile , among stars redward of the trough ( @xmath57)>3 $ ] ) , the average color is bluer in upper sco than in taurus .",
    "these characteristics can be explained in the following manner .",
    "the youngest systems have highly flared disks , and hence the largest ir excesses .",
    "as they evolve ( e.g. , growth of grains , accretion onto the star ) , disks become more settled and produce smaller excesses .",
    "after disks have become highly settled and have reached a certain level of initial clearing ( corresponding to @xmath57)\\sim3 $ ] ) , they quickly clear their remaining inner disks , resulting in a scarcity of disks with small excesses . because star formation is ongoing in taurus but has ceased in upper sco , the distribution of excesses in the former is more heavily weighted to younger and redder disks . in other words ,",
    "the youngest disks in upper sco have already evolved substantially , explaining its paucity of very red disks relative to taurus .",
    "because the evolutionary stages of disks are not sampled in the same way by the differing star formation histories of taurus and upper sco , a comparison of the n(evolved+transitional)/n(full ) does not indicate the relative timescales of clearing between the two populations @xcite .",
    "instead , one must compare the ratio of the number of evolved and transitional disks to the number of sources slightly redward of the trough , i.e. , the shape of the distribution of excesses at @xmath57)\\lesssim3.5 $ ] .",
    "this property is not tightly constrained in either region because of the small numbers of stars involved , but taurus and upper sco do not show any obvious differences . thus , there is no evidence to indicate that the clearing timescale changes from the age of taurus to the age of upper sco ( @xmath1310  myr ) . the data in figure  [ fig : histo ]",
    "do reveal a higher abundance of candidates for evolved transitional disks or debris disks in upper sco .",
    "if the lifetime of the evolved transitional stage is similar to that of the transitional and evolved stages , then most of these candidates in upper sco are probably debris disks .",
    "it is expected that upper sco would contain more debris disks than taurus given their relative ages .    as discussed in section  [ sec : criteria ] , the definition of transitional disks adopted by @xcite encompasses some of the objects redward of the gap in the mid - ir colors in regions like taurus and upper sco . as a result , they have derived higher abundances of transitional disks in young clusters , and hence a longer timescale for inner disk clearing , than found here and in other studies that use a more restrictive definition for transitional disks @xcite . of course , it is not meaningful to compare abundances of transitional disks and the resulting timescales among studies that do not define this evolutionary stage in the same manner .",
    "we contend that the clearing timescales from @xcite are less useful and practical since they are based on a definition of transitional disks that is subject to uncertainties and degeneracies in model seds and that does not rely on distinct observational signatures ( i.e. , gap in colors ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the gap in mid - ir colors in taurus is not evidence of a short lifetime for the evolutionary stage of disks within this gap , contrary to the original interpretation @xcite .",
    "instead , they argued that the gap is present because few members of taurus are old enough to have reached that stage , and that the diskless stars in taurus have lost their disks due to binary companions rather than advanced age . in @xcite , we noted that a rather large fraction of the taurus population is diskless ( 40% among non - protostars ) and that these stars are older than disk - bearing members , on average , based on their wider spatial distribution , demonstrating that a significant number of stars in taurus have aged sufficiently to fully clear their disks , and hence pass through the evolved and transitional stages .",
    "@xcite reiterated the same points from their previous study , but also conceded that many of the diskless stars in taurus may indeed be older than their counterparts with disks .",
    "here , we once again contend that if a significant number of stars have aged sufficiently to have fully cleared their disks , then the evolved and transitional stages should be fully sampled as well , and therefore their scarcity demonstrates that they are short - lived relative to full disks .",

    "we have used colors computed between @xmath41 and six of the _ spitzer _ and bands to identify the members that exhibit excess emission from circumstellar disks .",
    "we have estimated the evolutionary stages of the detected disks using the sizes of the excesses among these bands .",
    "these stages are defined based on distinct structural characteristics that are apparent in the seds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) , and they consist of the following : optically thick disks without large holes or gaps ( _ full _ ) , optically thick disks with large holes ( _ transitional _ ) , optically thin disks without large holes or gaps ( _ evolved _ ) , optically thin disks with large holes ( _ evolved transitional _ ) , and disks of second - generation dust ( _ debris _ ) . through these classifications ,",

    "this trend was first observed by @xcite , and is now reinforced with a sample that is larger and reaches lower stellar masses . the combination of these data and the latest age estimate for upper sco ( @xmath0  myr , * ? ? ?",

    "k0m5 members of upper sco show a dearth of disks with small excesses ( transitional and evolved disks ) .",
    "when the differences in star formation histories of upper sco and taurus ( @xmath9  myr ) are taken into account , the distributions of excesses for both regions indicate a timescale for inner disk clearing that is much shorter than the typical lifetime of primordial disks .",
