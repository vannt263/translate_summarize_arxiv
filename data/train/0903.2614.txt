    "in 1878 heine studied the following problem : given two polynomials , @xmath0 where the zeros of @xmath1 are complex and pairwise distinct , describe the polynomial solutions of the _ generalized lam differential _ equation ( in algebraic form ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a polynomial ( in general , depending on @xmath4 ) of degree @xmath5 ; if @xmath6 , then @xmath7 is monic . for @xmath8 we can easily recognize in the hypergeometric differential equation , while for @xmath9 it is known as the heun s equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "heine @xcite proved that for every @xmath10 there exist at most @xmath11 different polynomials @xmath3 such that admits a polynomial solution @xmath12 ; hereafter @xmath13 stands for the set of all algebraic polynomials of degree @xmath14 .",
    "these particular @xmath3 s are called _ van vleck polynomials _ , and the corresponding polynomial solutions @xmath15 are known as _ heine - stieltjes _ ( or simply stieltjes ) polynomials . furthermore ,",
    "if the polynomials @xmath1 and @xmath16 are algebraically independent then for any @xmath17 there exist _ exactly _ @xmath18 van vleck polynomials @xmath3 , their degree is _ exactly _ @xmath19 , and for each @xmath3 equation has a unique ( up to a constant factor ) solution @xmath20 of degree @xmath4 .",
    "according to recent results in @xcite , this statement still holds for arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath16 for all sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "stieltjes discovered an electrostatic interpretation of zeros of the polynomials discussed in @xcite , which attracted common attention to the problem .",
    "he studied the problem in a particular setting , assuming that all zeros of @xmath1 are real and that all residues @xmath21 in @xmath22 are strictly positive .",
    "he proved in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.8 ) ) that in this case for each @xmath10 there are _ exactly _ @xmath18 different van vleck polynomials of degree @xmath19 and the same number of corresponding heine - stieltjes polynomials @xmath20 of degree @xmath4 , given by all possible ways how the @xmath4 zeros of @xmath20 can be distributed in the @xmath23 open intervals defined by the zeros of @xmath1 .",
    "after these two contributions a vast number of research papers on this topic has been published , dealing mainly with the real situation considered by stieltjes . besides the relevant contribution to the algebraic theory @xcite , we can mention here the paper @xcite , where the limit distribution of zeros of heine - stieltjes polynomials for the stieltjes case has been established in terms of the traditional extremal problem for the weighted logarithmic energy on a compact set of the plane .",
    "a new approach to the asymptotics of the polynomial solutions of , based on a different type of equilibrium problem , has been developed in @xcite , where zero distribution of heine - stieltjes polynomials was investigated .",
    "the present paper is in many senses a continuation of @xcite .",
    "we use essentially the same tools : families of continuous critical measures and their representations in terms of quadratic differentials with closed trajectories .",
    "however , the starting point of our considerations here is different : instead of electrostatics we use the wkb method , which allows to obtain the strong asymptotics .",
    "in this section we describe briefly the strong asymptotics of polynomial solutions of .",
    "as we will see immediately , it is based on the asymptotics of van vleck polynomials , so formally we should have started with the latter topic .",
    "we choose another way of presentation , which follows rather the logic of the proof of the main result .",
    "we formulate next a theorem on asymptotics of heine - stieltjes polynomials , which contains van vleck polynomials as unknown ( `` access '' ) parameters .",
    "hereafter we assume that @xmath17 is sufficiently large , so that there are exactly @xmath18 van vleck polynomials , each of degree exactly @xmath19 , see @xcite ; denote by @xmath24 one of these van vleck polynomials , and let @xmath25 stand for the set of zeros of @xmath3 , @xmath26 the set of zeros of @xmath1 , and @xmath27 .",
    "fix any @xmath28 ; in any simply - connected domain @xmath29 we can select a single - valued branch of @xmath30 and define the _ natural parameter _",
    "@xmath31 in what follows , many statements will be made in terms of trajectories of the quadratic differential @xmath32 which are basically level lines of the function @xmath33 .",
    "we define also @xmath34 as well as the parameter @xmath35    [ mainthm ] with the assumptions and notations above , let @xmath36 be a heine - stieltjes polynomial ( solution of ) corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "then :    1 .",
    "there exist a set @xmath37 comprised of a finite number of at most @xmath38 disjoint jordan arcs @xmath39 , such that for an appropriate selection of the branch in , @xmath40 where @xmath41 moreover , @xmath42 with @xmath43 uniformly for @xmath44 .",
    "the endpoints of each @xmath39 belong to @xmath45 .",
    "two arcs @xmath46 and @xmath39 for @xmath47 are either disjoint or have a common endpoint .",
    "the domain @xmath48 is connected , and @xmath49 has a single - valued branch .",
    "consequently , the branch of the square root in is fully determined by condition @xmath50 3 .",
    "each @xmath39 can be selected as a part of a trajectory of the quadratic differential @xmath51 which is close to its critical trajectory completed by two small segments connecting the trajectory with two points from @xmath45 .",
    "observe that formula is given in terms of polynomials @xmath24 . in this way , the problem of asymptotics of heine - stieltjes polynomials is reduced to that of van vleck polynomials .",
    "we discuss the location of the zeros of @xmath24 s in section [ sec : vanvleckzeros ] .",
    "the critical role is played by the set @xmath52 .",
    "more exactly , formula should be combined with the local asymptotic formula for @xmath53 in a neighborhood of @xmath39 ( but away from the endpoints ) : @xmath54\\,,\\ ] ] for certain small @xmath55 .",
    "local formulas of this type can be obtained directly from the wkb estimates as explained in @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of a global formula with the specified dominant term is not totally trivial .",
    "an arc @xmath39 enters the wkb analysis naturally as the stokes line : the dominant term in changes across @xmath39 ( stokes phenomenon ) .",
    "this means that two terms are asymptotically equal on @xmath39 , and equation @xmath56 defines the zeros of @xmath53 . in other words , arcs",
    "@xmath39 asymptotically carry zeros of @xmath53 .",
    "the proof of the theorem is based on the liouvulle - green ( also known as the wkb ) asymptotic formula . as we have mentioned above , the wkb method ,",
    "the way it is explained in @xcite , is ready to use in order to obtain local estimates .",
    "construction of a global formula from the local ones constitutes a challenge , as it usually happens in the wkb analysis .",
    "so , the proof of the theorem , which is outlined next , is not entirely on the surface , and relies heavily on the fact that both the coefficients and a solution of are polynomials .",
    "the liouville - green ( also known as the wkb ) method is a standard tool of asymptotic analysis of ordinary differential equations ; we refer the reader to the comprehensive account contained in the monographs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was probably nuttall @xcite who applied the wkb analysis to the study of the strong asymptotics of the generalized jacobi polinomials via a differential equation of the form .      recall that at this stage we assume that the van vleck polynomial @xmath3 is fixed , and denote by @xmath15 a corresponding heine - stieltjes polynomial of degree @xmath4 .",
    "the following procedure is well known , so we summarize it here very briefly .    rewriting equation in terms of @xmath57",
    "we eliminate the first order derivative and get @xmath58 , with @xmath59 where @xmath60 has been defined in and @xmath61 fix any @xmath28 ; the liouville - green transformation @xmath62 , with @xmath63 defined in , yields @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 a detailed discussion of this transformation in the complex plain and of the resulting wkb approximation can be found , e.g.  in @xcite .      at this point",
    "let us recall briefly some notions from the theory of rational quadratic differentials on the riemann sphere ; see @xcite and @xcite for further details .",
    "given the quadratic differential @xmath67 defined in , a smooth curve @xmath68 along which @xmath69 is a _ horizontal arc _ of @xmath70 ; the distinguished parameter @xmath71 was defined in .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath68 given by a parametrization @xmath72 , @xmath73 , then @xmath74 a maximal horizontal arc is called a _ horizontal trajectory _ ( or simply a _ trajectory _ ) of @xmath70 .",
    "analogously , trajectories of @xmath75 are called _ orthogonal _ or _ vertical trajectories _ of @xmath67 ; along these curves @xmath76    we can define a conformal invariant metric associated with the quadratic differential @xmath77 , given by the length element @xmath78 ; the @xmath67-length of a curve @xmath68 is @xmath79 ( observe that this definition differs by a normalization constant from the definition 5.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath80 is a simply connected domain not containing singular points of @xmath67 , we can introduce the @xmath67-distance by @xmath81 trajectories and orthogonal trajectories are in fact geodesics ( in the @xmath67-metric ) connecting any two of its points ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 8.4 ) ) .",
    "a simply connected domain @xmath80 not containing points from @xmath82 is called a _ @xmath67-rectangle _ if it is delimited by two horizontal and two vertical arcs of @xmath67 ; in other words , if @xmath83 is a ( euclidean ) rectangle @xmath84\\times [ c , d]$ ] , and @xmath85 is a one - to - one conformal mapping .",
    "we call the value @xmath86 the @xmath87-height , @xmath88 the @xmath67-length , and @xmath89 the @xmath67-perimeter of @xmath80 . obviously , these definitions are consistent with the freedom in the selection of the natural parameter @xmath71 .",
    "theorems on local asymptotics of solutions are well - known ( see @xcite and @xcite ) ; using the local estimates that appear in ( * ? ? ?",

    "this yields the following result :    [ prop : wkb1 ] with the assumptions above , let @xmath101 be an euclidean rectangle such that @xmath102 and @xmath71 can be continued holomorphically to @xmath101 in such a way that @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath104 be the euclidean distance from @xmath105 to the boundary of @xmath106 .",
    "then we can replace the estimates by latexmath:[\\[\\label{boundsolver }        in a @xmath67-rectangle @xmath80 we can select a single valued branch of the function @xmath108 introduced in",
