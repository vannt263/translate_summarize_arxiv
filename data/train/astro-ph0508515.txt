    "the accretion powered x - ray pulsars are usually found within high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) . the hmxb may be divided mainly into those with main - sequence be star companions , and those with evolved ob supergiants companions .    in the case of",
    "be / x - ray binaries the hard x - ray emission is caused by accretion of circumstellar material on to the neutron star .",
    "the source of accreting material is thought to be concentrated towards the equatorial plane of the rapidly rotating be stars .",
    "most of be / x - rays binaries are transients , displaying x - ray outburst and long period of quiescence , when no x - ray flux is detected .",
    "a smaller group of be / x - rays binaries are persistent sources with rather low x - ray luminosity ( @xmath28erg / s ) , relatively long ( @xmath29s ) pulse periods and very weak iron line at 6.4 kev .",

    "the supergiant binaries may be further subdivided into two classes , depending on whether the mass transfer is due to the roche lobe overflow , or a capture from the stellar wind .",

    "all the known systems display approximately the same x - ray luminosity @xmath30 erg / s .",
    "variable x - ray activity of  indicates that this binary system unlikely contains an ob supergiant .",
    "in any of the cases mentioned above we should expect that the optical companion of the x - ray source should be bright in the optical and infrared spectral bands . in order to check this",
    "we used the results of dss and 2mass surveys . in both catalogs a relatively bright star with magnitudes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ,",
    "is visible in the vicinity of the x - ray source , but its position is just outside the  error box ( the offset between the positions is @xmath36@xmath37@xmath37 ) . besides this bright star",
    "another possible counterpart candidate is found in 2mass with coordinates ( equinox 2000 ) ra=13@xmath3801@xmath3958@xmath40.7 , dec=-6358@xmath3709@xmath37@xmath37 ( at @xmath41@xmath37@xmath37 from the best  position ) and magnitudes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the good agreement between both positions would tend to suggest that this second source is the likely counterpart to .    to estimate the de - reddened magnitude",
    "we assume that this counterpart was only absorbed by the galactic absorption on the line of sight . using the value of @xmath45 @xmath16 we estimate the de - reddened magnitudes @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( only statistical uncertainties are quoted ) . if the companion star is a be main sequence star with surface temperature around 10000 k and the radius around 6 - 10 @xmath49 we can expect to see its infrared brightness @xmath50 if the binary system is at the distance @xmath51 kpc .",
    "an additional tentative argument in favour of such source distance is the source location in the direction to the crux spiral arm tangent , as hmxbs are concentrated towards galactic spiral arms @xcite . at such a distance unabsorbed intrinsic luminosity of",

    "the source was observed several times in 1993 - 2004 with ,  and  during the monitoring campaigns of the pulsar .",
    "the typical flux measured from the source in the @xmath7 kev energy band is about @xmath55 erg @xmath16 s@xmath2 , but in jan - feb 2004 an outburst with more than 5 times increase of the intensity was observed from the source . during this outburst",
    "the source was also detected in the hard x - rays with the  observatory .",
    "strong pulsations of the x - ray flux with a period @xmath54 s were detected .",
    "the study of a set of observations has shown that the pulse period changed from @xmath56 sec in 1994 to @xmath57 sec in 2004 .",
    "the average value of the spin - up rate is @xmath58hz s@xmath2 , that is typical for accretion powered x - ray pulsars ( see e.g. bildsten et al .",

    "the proposed infrared counterpart to the x - ray source does not contradict this hypothesis . from brightness of the infrared counterpart",
