    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) started to be observed from an astronomical point of view by @xcite . recently",
    "some excellent reviews have been written , see @xcite .",
    "the recent trend of research connects grbs with supernovae ( sn ) explosions and their consequent remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the afterglow is observed in x , optical , and infrared , see @xcite .",
    "the established connection between grbs and snrs allows of restricting the astrophysical environment to the advancing shock . in the last 60 years",
    "the theoretical studies of the advancing shock of snr have been focused on the relationship with the instantaneous radius of expansion , @xmath0 , which is of type @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is time and @xmath3 is a parameter that depends on the chosen model . the most popular model is the sedov  taylor expansion which predicts @xmath4 , see @xcite , and the thin layer approximation in the presence of a constant density medium , which predicts @xmath5 , see @xcite . a simple version of the sedov  taylor solution , which also considers the transition from the relativistic to the non - relativistic regime , appeared in @xcite",
    ". the radiative transfer during the afterglow phase has been analysed by @xcite , where a comprehensive analysis , including images of the expected light curves , is carried out .",
    "the actual situation of the theoretical and observational research on snrs leaves a series of questions unanswered or only partially answered :    * can we deduce a theoretical expression for the counts / s versus time in a grb assuming a direct proportionality between the flux of kinetic energy of the advancing shell and the intensity of emission ? * can we simulate the x - ray ring of grb 032103 , which was observed six hours after the burst ? *",
    "can we deduce a theoretical expression for the frequency at which the grb becomes visible as a function of the time ?    in order to answer these questions ,",
    "section [ sec_data ] reports the data on grbs .",
    "section [ secsedov ] reviews the free expansion , the sedov  taylor solution and the power law model .",
    "section [ sec_transfer ] reviews the existing situation about the radiative transport equation and a simple geometrical model which leads to the ring emission .",
    "section [ sec_flux_time ] contains some scaling arguments that lead to the observed count / s versus time relationship .",
    "grbs are characterized by a rapid rise ( called the trigger ) in the rate of detected photons per second at a given energy , for example 20 kev . a typical example observed by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) ,",
    "see @xcite , on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) is reported in fig .",
    "[ kevtempo ] .",
    "> from the previous figure it is important to point out that the time necessary to reach the maximum is 1.25  s. in the following we will consider this time small compared to the time in which the counts / s decreases .",
    "a numerical analysis of the observed rate versus time relationship can be done by assuming a power law dependence for the rate of counts of the type @xmath6 where the two parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are found from a numerical analysis of the data .",
    "an interesting analysis of the time evolution of 12 grbs as observed by the swift gamma - ray burst mission ( swift ) , see @xcite , is reported in @xcite .",

    "[ spettro ] and        can be approximated by the following formula @xmath9    another interesting property of the grbs is that the frequency of observation at which they start to be visible decreases with time .",

    "also interesting is the case of grb 032103 , which was observed in the x - ray ( energy range 0.72.5 kev ) by xmm - newton s mos cameras six hours after the grb , see @xcite . in this case",
    "the combined mos images show two concentric rings which expand outwards .",
    "the numerical analysis gives @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angular separation between the the two maxima in the radial profiles of counts , @xmath2 is the time , and @xmath13 the initial time . in the following",
    "we will associate the grbs with the explosions of supernovae which are classified as snr , see section 4 in @xcite .",
    "this section reviews the expansion at constant velocity , the sedov  taylor , and the power law models .",
    "the snr expands at a constant velocity until the surrounding mass is of the order of the solar mass .",

    "the emissivity of the ultrarelativistic synchrotron radiation from a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of electrons whose @xmath65 is given by equation  ( [ spectrum ] ) is , according to @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath46 is the frequency and @xmath67 is a slowly varying function of @xmath68 which is of the order of unity and is given by @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",

    "a visual inspection of the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) allows us to say that in an astrophysical environment in which the number density of the electrons is decreasing with time , the frequency at which the medium becomes transparent will also progressively decrease .",
    "the time dependence of the frequency at which the medium is transparent , according to ( [ formularho ] ) , is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the same parameter as in ( [ deltar ] ) and the index @xmath119 means a second way to deduce the free parameter .",
