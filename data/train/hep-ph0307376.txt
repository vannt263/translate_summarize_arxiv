    "the paper has three appendices where we have collected formulas for the reader interested in the details of the computations .",
    "the standard method to determine the renormalization constant of the current @xmath28 consists of computing the overall uv - divergences of quark - antiquark - to - vacuum _ on - shell _ matrix elements of spin - triplet currents at a certain loop order including lower order counterterm diagrams needed to subtract the subdivergences .",
    "there are , however , technical complications in this approach due to the existence of ir - divergent coulomb phases for on - shell quarks and from the fact that the vertex diagrams in general depend on three physical scales , the mass @xmath10 , the c.m.energy @xmath64 and the external quark momentum @xmath65 .",
    "note that imposing the on - shell condition @xmath66 on the quark - antiquark - to - vacuum matrix elements in dimensional regularization , yields ir - divergent @xmath67 poles that are very difficult to separate from the uv - divergences . in practice",
    "it is therefore necessary to compute the quark - antiquark - to - vacuum matrix elements in an asymptotic expansion for @xmath68 , where the ir - divergent coulomb phases manifest themselves as powers of @xmath69 . an efficient way to avoid these complications and , in addition , to reduce",
    "the number of diagrams that have to be computed is to consider current correlator graphs rather than the vertex diagrams .",
    "the correlator graphs are obtained from closing the external quark lines of the vertex diagrams with an additional insertion of the current @xmath28 .",
    "this means that one has to determine diagrams with one more loop , but it reduces the number of diagrams to be considered , eliminates the quark momentum @xmath65 as an external scale and avoids the ir - divergent coulomb phases . moreover , since all ir - divergences cancel , using correlator graphs it is not necessary to distinguish on- and off - shell contributions since any off - shell term that could be relevant for the renormalization constant leads to scaleless integrals in dimensional regularization which automatically vanish . in this approach",
    "the three - loop ( nnll ) renormalization constant of the current @xmath28 is obtained from the subdivergences in four - loop correlator diagrams that remain after the one- and two - loop subdivergences have been subtracted .",
    "the surviving four - loop overall divergences are canceled by external vacuum - type diagrams and not related to the renormalization of the current @xmath28 .",
    "the method applies analously at any order .",
    "interestingly , the overall divergences of the four - loop correlator graph vanish in dimensional regularization because the graphs are non - analytic in the c.m.energy , and there are no operators in the effective theory that could absorb the overall divergences .",
    "the result for the renormalization constant obtained by this method will agree with the one obtained from quark - antiquark - to - vacuum on - shell matrix elements .    for illustration let us reconsider the computation of the nll renormalization constant that leads to eq.([c1ad ] ) .",
    "the relevant correlator diagrams are shown in fig.[fignllcorrelators ] .",
    "0.0 cm    four - quark interactions without label refer to the coulomb potential .",
    "crosses on quark lines refer to insertions of the quark kinetic energy at subleading order . here and throughout the paper , combinatorial factors and diagrams obtained by flipping the graphs left - to - right and up - to - down are to be understood .",
    "there are no one - loop subdivergences that have to be subtracted in this case . adopting the form @xmath70 for the unrenormalized wilson coefficient of the current @xmath28 with the renormalization constant written as @xmath71 one obtains @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given in eq.([c1ad ] ) . taking into account the velocity renormalization group equations for the vnrqcd coefficients in @xmath62 dimensions ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , etc . )",
