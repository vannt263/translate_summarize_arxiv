    "one basic characteristics of amorphous ion conductors is the strong frequency dependence of the conductivity at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite . according to linear response theory , the dispersion in @xmath0 is equivalent to a non - diffusive mean square displacement @xmath1 and thus to the presence of correlated back and forth jumps @xcite . neglecting possible dynamic correlations among adjacent ions",
    "the relation between both quantities reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the charge and @xmath4 the density of the mobile ions .",
    "the function @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 for very high frequencies one observes local dynamics which is strongly system - dependent .",
    "for example , in a sodium silicate system @xcite one observes for @xmath7 hz a continuous decrease of @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath8 which can typically be attributed to non - local dynamics @xcite and becomes stronger for decreasing temperature .",
    "actually , this conclusion has been explicitly verified in recent simulations for lithium metasilicate @xcite . in a double - logarithmic representation at low temperatures the apparent exponent decreases from one to zero until the d.c .",
    "plateau is reached , i.e. @xmath9 .    in general , the complexity of ion dynamics in disordered systems is , on the one hand , related to the static disorder of the material and , on the other hand , to the coulomb interaction among the ions giving rise to dynamic disorder .",
    "therefore , one might expect that both the static as well as the dynamic disorder enhances the number of correlated back and forth jumps ( see , however , ref.@xcite ) although in recent simulations of sodium silicate at @xmath10 k no such correlations have been observed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of different environments of the network might imply that at a given time some ions are more mobile than other ions , i.e. there exist dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "unfortunately , no direct information about dynamic heterogeneities can be gained from conductivity experiments or , equivalently , from the time dependence of the mean square displacement .",
    "some progress has been achieved on the basis of simulations . comparing the mean square displacement of different ions during a given time",
    "a broad distribution has been observed @xcite .",
    "this basically corresponds to the presence of a large non - gaussian parameter which is known to represent dynamic heterogeneities quite well @xcite .",
    "other groups found an interesting spatial structure of the mobile regions @xcite .",
    "another system with intrinsic complex dynamics is a glass - forming liquid . a tagged particle in a glass - former experiences a dramatic slowing down with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "to a large extent this is related to the cage effect since at low temperatures the neighbour particles have a strong confining effect on the central particle @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to strongly subdiffusive dynamics , i.e. to correlated back and forth dynamics .",
    "furthermore glass - forming systems display dynamic heterogeneities @xcite",
    ". this property has been quantified by invoking appropriate three - time correlation functions , containing information about the dynamics during two subsequent time intervals @xcite .",
    "using these three - time correlation functions one can hope to answer several basic questions about the complexity of ion dynamics .",
    "how relevant are backward correlations ?",
    "are back and forth correlations restricted to nearest - neighbor ionic positions ?",
    "how does the tendency of these back and forth correlations depend on the time scale of investigation ?",
    "do dynamic heterogeneities depend on temperature and thus invalidate the time - temperature superposition principle , observed for many other quantities like the conductivity ?",
    "this and other aspects of ionic dynamics will be analysed in this paper by invoking appropriate three - time correlation functions .",
    "they will be applied to computer generated trajectories of lithium metasilicate ( li@xmath11o)(sio@xmath11 ) .",
    "very recently , first measurements of three - time correlations have been conducted via multidimensional nmr .",
    "these results clearly showed that dynamic heterogeneities are omnipresent in disordered ionic conductors @xcite    the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the technical aspects of the simulation and discuss the numerical tools .",
    "section 3 introduces the concept of three - time correlations .",
    "section 4 contains the analysis of simple model systems for which we clarify the information content of the three - time correlation functions .",
    "the results of our simulations as well as their interpretation are presented in section 5 .",
    "we close with a discussion and a summary in section 6 .",
    "the potential energy for the lithium silicate system is chosen to be the sum of a buckingham and a coulomb pair potential ( @xmath12 denote the species lithium , oxygen , or silicon , respectively ) @xmath13 the parameters have been determined by habasaki et al .",
    "details of our simulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we performed molecular dynamics simulations with a time step of 2 fs and a density of @xmath14 g @xmath15 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used .",
    "the system size is 1152 particles , thus containing 384 lithium ions .",
    "the trajectories were generated by an appropriately modified version of the moldy software package , supplied by k. refson @xcite .",
    "the length of the production runs was 16 ns after an equilibration time of ca .",
    "10 ns at the two lowest temperatures . even at @xmath16 = 640",
    "k the mean square displacement during the production time was larger than 60 @xmath17 ( nearest - neighbour li - li distance 2.6  ) ; see ref .  @xcite .",
    "all configurations were equilibrated at t = 1500 k. the computer glass transition is approximately 1100 k @xcite . in this work we present simulations for five temperatures ( t = 1240 k , t = 980 k , 750 k , 700 k , and 640 k ) .",
    "for all temperatures , the lithium subsystem has been equilibrated before starting the production run . in particular at the lower temperatures the network fluctuations are very small ( mean square displacement of 0.3 @xmath17 ) .",

    "here we want to introduce a formalism which allows one to elucidate the properties of back and forth dynamics in detail .",
    "we remind the reader that standard observables for the characterization of dynamical properties like the mean square displacement correlate the position of individual ions at two successive times @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for a calculation of @xmath22 one averages over the configurations at all times @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath23 . back and forth",
    "dynamics , however , is related to the properties of particles during two subsequent time intervals . formally , this can be described as a three - time correlation , including a third time @xmath24 .",

    "[ fig_1 ] , the value of @xmath19 is counted negative .",
    "the additional information about the dynamics during two successive time intervals as compared to the dynamics during a single time interval is contained in the conditional probability function @xmath27 which denotes the probability for a specific value of @xmath19 under the condition that the particle has moved the distance @xmath18 in the first time interval .      rather than analysing the full probability function , we concentrate on the first moment @xmath28 and the second moment @xmath29 .",
    "the interpretation of both functions is straightforward .",
    "@xmath28 contains information about the relevance of back and forth dynamics . in case that the direction of the dynamics during two successive time intervals is uncorrelated one expects @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , a negative value of @xmath31 is direct evidence of the presence of back and forth dynamics .",
    "the second moment @xmath32 yields information about the presence of dynamic heterogeneities . in case that all particles have the same mobility ,",
    "the distance moved in the second time interval is independent of the distance moved in the first time interval .",
    "thus @xmath33 would _ not _ depend on @xmath18 .",
    "a dependence on @xmath18 will be observed if there exist fast and slow ions .",
    "the subensemble of ions with small @xmath18 will preferably contain slow ions whereas for ions with large @xmath18 it is vice versa .",
    "therefore , ions with small @xmath18 will on average move less in the second time interval @xmath34 than ions with large @xmath18 , resulting in a monotonous increase of @xmath33 with @xmath18 .",
    "it is possible to establish a direct relation between the mean square displacement and the first moment @xmath28 for the case of a discrete hopping model in the limit @xmath36 . for reasons of simplicity",
    "we take a 1d model with distances @xmath37 between the individual sites .",
    "one may start with the simple relation @xmath38 which is valid for stationary processes . on the left side one can perform a linear expansion around @xmath39 . on the right side",
    "one may use the fact that for very small @xmath40 the term @xmath41 can be written as @xmath42 ( corresponding to the short - time diffusion in pure hopping models with an effective escape rate @xmath43 ) . since for very short times",
    "the system can only jump to the nearest neighbor site the term @xmath44 can be expressed as @xmath45 . inserting these relations into eq.[r2 ]",
    "one finally ends up with @xmath46.\\ ] ]    this relation directly shows that exactly in case of diffusive dynamics , i.e. @xmath47 , one has @xmath48 ,",
    "i.e. no correlated back and forth dynamics . for subdiffusive behavior one obtains ( beyond a possible oscillatory regime of the mean square displacement ) @xmath49 and thus @xmath50 .",
    "thus subdiffusive behavior is equivalent to the presence of correlated forward and backward jumps .",
    "furthermore validity of eq.[firstmoment ] implies that the first moment @xmath51 has a lower limit @xmath52 which is reached if @xmath53 , i.e. for the long - time limit of localized dynamics where any forth jump is followed by a back jump .",
    "finally one can see that the range of dispersion , i.e. @xmath54 , can be related to the first moment @xmath51 in the limit @xmath35 and @xmath55 .",
    "this formal treatment has been performed for a hopping model with discrete sites .",
    "this may be considered as an appropriate model also for more realistic systems for which the particles will fluctuate around the individual sites . in particular",
    "this is the case for the ion conductor , studied in this work ( see below for more details ) .",
    "in contrast , for glass - forming systems hopping dynamics is not so relevant . therefore it is not possible to formulate such a simple relation between the derivative @xmath5 of the mean square displacement and the first moment @xmath56 .",
    "eq.[firstmoment ] also implies that the first moment @xmath57 in the limit @xmath35 does _ not _",
    "contain new information as compared to the mean square displacement . for finite @xmath40 , however",
    ", the first moment can no longer be predicted from @xmath5 .",
    "thus new information as compared to the mean square displacement about the nature of correlated back and forth dynamics becomes available .",
    "of particular interest is the dependence of the first moment on @xmath18 . for example one can learn whether there exists a long - range back - dragging effect , as implied e.g. in the percolation approach of ion dynamics , or whether after jumping to the next nearest neighbor site the memory about the initial site has been basically wiped out",
    "in order to clarify the information content of the first moment @xmath28 and the second moment @xmath33 we first calculate them for some simple one - dimensional models .",
    "we always consider the case of stochastic dynamics since we are interested in time scales which are beyond the ballistic regime .",
    "this model is relevant to describe the backward and forward dynamics in the individual potential wells .",
    "we consider a harmonic oscillator with minimum at @xmath58 .",
    "both times @xmath59 are longer than the equilibration time of the oscillator , i.e. the mean square displacement is already constant .",
    "we first calculate the probability @xmath60 that after the first time interval the system is at @xmath61 after a motion of @xmath18 to the right .",
    "this can be formally calculated as @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the equilibrium distribution and @xmath64 is the probability to move from @xmath65 to @xmath61 during time @xmath40 . for large @xmath40",
    "the latter term is identical to the equilibrium distribution , i.e. @xmath66 . the resulting gaussian integral can be easily solved .",
    "here we are particularly interested in the first moment @xmath67 of @xmath60 .",
    "one obtains @xmath68 for long @xmath34 the system acquires the average @xmath69 , yielding @xmath70 thus the back - dragging effect in the second time interval is proportional to the distance moved in the first time interval .",

    "the qualitative features of the result do not depend on the exact value of this temperature .",
    "we have chosen @xmath40 such that on this time scale a particle leaves the initial well with a probability of approximately 50% .",
    "furthermore we have chosen @xmath75 .",

    "this results in a positive value of @xmath28 .",
    "d ) for @xmath81 , one has the same result as for @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 .      @xmath28 as obtained from monte carlo simulations of a periodic potential with alternating barriers .",
    "the potential is shown in the inset.,width=325 ]    so far we have only discussed backwards dynamics due to intrawell dynamics . for an ion conductor one",
    "expects that dynamic forward backward correlations either result from static or from dynamic disorder .",
    "here we briefly discuss a very simple model which contains non - trivial forward backward dynamics .",
    "it is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] . due to the alternating barrier heights a particle performs several forward and backward jumps until it can escape from the local cage .",
    "we denote the two different transition rates by @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "our goal is to calculate @xmath87 .",
    "for very long @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath88 the dynamics resembles that of a random walk so that forward backward correlations should not be relevant , i.e. @xmath89 . therefore we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath90 .",
    "the analysis is presented in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath91 thus there exists a limiting value for @xmath35 which is reached for @xmath92 , i.e. the time scale of the fastest jump process . for larger values of @xmath40",
    "the back - dragging effect decreases with time ; see eq.[eqlong ] .",
    "@xmath93 approaches zero for @xmath40 of the order of @xmath94 .",
    "the physical reason is that for longer times @xmath40 the particle may also cross the high barrier during the first time interval .",
    "these events strongly reduce the total back - dragging effect in the subsequent time interval .",
    "thus the @xmath40-dependence contains valuable information about the time - scales involved in the dynamics and indicates at which time scale ( here : @xmath95 ) a simple random - walk description becomes relevant .    for @xmath96",
    "one obtains @xmath97 .",
    "this limit is trivial since there is no dynamics during the second time interval .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath98 the backjump effect is largest .",
    "thus it is this limit which is relevant to judge the maximum backjump capabilities .",
    "the rest of the discussion for this model system deals with this case .    to show the full dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath18 we again performed monte carlo simulations for a potential with alternating barriers .",
    "this potential was generated from the cos - potential , discussed above , by scaling the cos - potential by a factor 1.5 in the intervals @xmath99 , [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,4 ] , ... $ ] .",
    "the temperature was @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath40 is chosen such that the short - time limit @xmath101 is fulfilled whereas @xmath34 corresponds to the long - time limit @xmath102 .",
    "the transition rate is proportional to the attempt frequency in the minimum , which scales with the square root of the force constant and with the boltzmann factor .",

    "the result for @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] .",
    "it resembles that of a periodic potential except for a systematic downward trend .",
    "thus we have a superposition of the correlation effects of simple periodic potentials with wells and barriers and of barriers with different heights .",
    "actually , it turns out that our estimate of @xmath93 agrees reasonably well with the numerical value of ca .",

    "@xmath105 as obtained from monte carlo simulations of a potential with random traps .",
    "the potential is shown in the inset.,width=325 ]    finally , we want to present a very simple model which allows one to grasp the relevant features of the second moment @xmath33 .",
    "we start with an ( possibly high - dimensional ) array of traps with different depths .",
    "such models have been extensively studied in the context of supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "different rates @xmath106 are randomly attributed to the different traps .",
    "for such a simple model the dynamics is purely diffusive .",
    "here we are specifically interested in the ratio @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "according to our discussion in section iii @xmath105 is a measure for the relevance of dynamic heterogeneities .",

    "this can be easily rationalized for a bimodal rate distribution with rates @xmath84 , @xmath85 and weights @xmath115 , @xmath116 , respectively . a straightforward calculation yields @xmath117 which for a bimodal distribution is strictly larger than one . for stronger dynamic heterogeneities ,",
    "i.e. a broader distribution of rates @xmath111 , @xmath105 also increases .",

    "a particle with @xmath82 has by chance returned to the original position .",
    "this implies that the condition @xmath82 no longer implies any dynamical selection of slow particles .",
    "thus one expects @xmath120 . whereas the detailed time - dependence of @xmath105 depends on more details of the model like the number of neighbor traps , the limiting values are generally valid .    in order to visualize the full time - dependence , and to check our analytic expression",

    "this observation would be compatible with only minor spatial correlations among ionic sites of similar mobility .",
    "in particular , it would contradict the scenario of compact regions of ionic sites each with a different ionic mobility . in this case , a particle which has jumped twice would , on average , belong to a faster region than particles which only jumped once during the first time interval .",
    "this difference would show up in the mean square displacement during the second time interval since particles in the faster region would , on average , also jump further in the second time interval .",
    "this would lead to a strong increase of @xmath33 beyond the nearest neighbor distance @xmath37 .    in order to study the temperature dependence and the time - dependence in greater detail we have calculated @xmath161 in dependence of @xmath162 and for different temperatures .",
    "@xmath105 is a direct measure for the degree of dynamic heterogeneity on the length scale of the nearest - neighbor distance . in order to compare the different temperatures we have again scaled all times by the ratio @xmath153 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_10 ] .",
    "one can clearly see that the degree of heterogeneity changes with temperature .",
    "the lower the temperature the stronger the dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "thus on the level of dynamic heterogeneities the time - temperature superposition principle does not hold .",
    "for the lowest temperature @xmath105 is approximately 5.5 at the maximum .",
    "this number directly implies that the mean square displacement of a particle ( corrected for possible backwards correlations ) is 5.5 times larger in the second time interval if it has performed a jump in the first time interval as compared to particles which are still at the initial site after @xmath40 .",
    "in this paper we have shown how analysis of three - time correlations can be used to get model - free information about the nature of the complex ion dynamics .",
    "the characteristics of back and forth dynamics is reflected by the first moment of the three - time conditional probability function , the dynamic heterogeneities by the second moment .",
    "the main results are : ( i ) the long - range backward correlations beyond the nearest neighbor position , ( ii ) the gradual decrease of backward correlations with increasing @xmath40 , ( iii ) the time - temperature superposition principle for correlated back and forth dynamics , ( iv ) the significant dynamic heterogeneities at low temperatures , and ( v ) the lack of time - temperature superposition for the dynamic heterogeneities . in what follows we discuss these results in more detail .    for ion conductors at low temperatures the basically immobile network serves as a pseudo - external field for the lithium ions .",
    "therefore it has been attempted to model the lithium dynamics by simple lattice models like the random barrier or the random energy model @xcite . also in these models",
    "the long - range backward correlations are present . only in simple models",
    "like the alternate barrier model , discussed in this paper , back and forth jumps are restricted to the nearest neighbor position .",
    "the reason for these long - range backward correlations is quite intuitive : the ions look for paths which can can be accessed rather easily . in particular at low temperatures these paths can be rather extended . only for long times the ions manage to escape such a local path .",
    "this picture is consistent with the percolation approach which has been successfully applied to describe the dynamics in the random barrier and the random energy model @xcite .",
    "it may be interesting to compare this scenario with that of supercooled liquids .",
    "there all particles move on the same time scale .",
    "no pseudo - external fields are present .",
    "the complexity of the dynamics is due to the necessity of cooperative dynamics of the strongly interacting particles .",
    "a simple picture is to view a particle localized in the cage of the adjacent particles .",
    "the relevant relaxation process is to escape this local cage and afterwards being trapped in a new cage . in this case",
    "the first moment @xmath28 is constant for values of @xmath18 larger than the typical nearest - neighbor distance @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that after leaving the initial cage no significant memory to that cage is left .",
    "the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath28 for @xmath163 shows that this simple cage picture can not be used for the ionic dynamics .",
    "a possible explanation for this effect is the relevance of the static disordered energy landscape in ion conductors which leads to a dramatic reduction of multi - particle correlations @xcite such that cages , formed by adjacent ions , are less relevant .",
    "alternatively , one might argue that the presence of long - range coulomb interaction gives rise to long - range backward correlations .",
    "this aspect still has to be clarified .    in the alternate barrier model",
    "the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath40 reflects the values of the lowest and highest relevant barriers present in the system . on the time scale for which the highest relevant barrier is crossed",
    "no back and forth dynamics should be visible .",
    "indeed , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] , e.g. for t = 750 k , that the back and forth dynamics becomes small for @xmath40 of the order of 1 ns . the relaxation time , i.e. the decay time of @xmath124 , is of the same order . within",
    "the alternate barrier model one expects that for @xmath40 somewhat smaller than @xmath94 but still larger than @xmath164 one expects a linear dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath40 in marked contrast to the numerical results .",
    "this clearly shows that in contrast to the alternate barrier model the lithium metasilicate system is characterized by a broad distribution of relevant barriers .",
    "furthermore no short - time limit is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] but @xmath57 decreases also for the shortest times which could be analysed .",
    "this indicates the presence of transitions with very small saddles or , possibly , broad anharmonic potentials which are already relevant on the time scale of a few hundred femtoseconds .",
    "the alternate barrier model differs from our lithium metasilicate system also in another respect . for the alternate barrier model",
    "the typical jump time is of the order of @xmath164 .",
    "one can show that ( i ) the decay of @xmath5 is strongest for exactly this time scale and ( ii ) @xmath165 is already significantly smaller than unity . for the lithium metasilicate system at ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath131 k the decay of @xmath5 ( due to long - range processes ; see above ) is strongest in the ps range whereas @xmath166 is still close to the short - time plateau value .",
    "this discrepancy could be alleviated by introducing an additional variation of site energies .",
    "this would shift the decay of @xmath166 to times of the order of @xmath94 . on a qualitative level",
    "this would imply that the short - time dynamics occurs in asymmetric double - well potentials .",
    "it remains an important question whether the same scenario also holds in lithium metasilicate , i.e. whether fast back and forth jumps in strongly asymmetric double - well potentials are present .",
    "another scenario to rationalize the above - mentioned discrepancy will be presented further below .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been reported that for sodium silicate at t = 2000 k no backward correlations were observed .",
    "this is compatible with the experimental data for sodium silicate where the dispersion disappears for t @xmath167 1000 k. [ 5 ] . for the present system the dispersion disappears around a similar temperature .",
    "this shows up in a very little time - dependence of @xmath5 at 980 k in fig.5 beyond 1 ps",
    ". nevertheless , even these weak backward correlations are directly visible by analysis of the three - time correlations in fig.8 .",
    "as discussed below these backward correlations may be due to a small number of ions .",
    "thus a less detailed analysis may oversee these backward correlations .",
    "the approximate time - temperature superposition principle as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] implies that the back - dragging effect remains the same if analysed on appropriately adjusted time scales .",
    "note that this statement goes beyond the previous result that the mean square displacement displays time - temperature superposition . as discussed above the latter observable",
    "is only related to the @xmath168 limit of @xmath28 .",
    "the time - temperature superposition in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] may be used to discriminate between different models of ion dynamics .",
    "the significant heterogeneities , as characterized by the second moment , is compatible with the above - mentioned broad distribution of relevant barriers .",
    "actually , such a distribution complicates the interpretation of the dispersion @xmath169 in terms of correlated back and forth dynamics .",
    "this is exemplified for the simple case of two ( temporarily distinct ) ionic species with jump rates @xmath86 which are present with probabilities @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively . if we have in mind a log - gauss distribution of rates one should choose @xmath172 .",
    "generalizing eq.[firstmoment ] we get @xmath173 the terms @xmath174 imply that during the short time interval @xmath40 the probability of a particle of species i to perform a hop is proportional to the rate and its occurrence probability . in the limit ,",
    "discussed above , and under the additional assumption that @xmath175 is not much smaller or even larger than @xmath176 , this can be approximated by @xmath177 this result shows that the dispersion is to a large degree determined by the backjump properties of the _ fast _ species .",
    "thus in case of significant dynamic heterogeneities one has to be careful to relate the dispersion of the mean square displacement to the average backjump properties ( here : @xmath178 ) of the ions .",
    "this observation allows one to envisage another explanation of the very different time scales where the decay of @xmath5 is maximum ( ps regime ) and where the incoherent scattering function @xmath124 decays ( ns regime ) ; see above . a few fast ions with significant back- and forth correlations can dominate the time - dependence of @xmath5 but hardly contribute to the decay of the incoherent scattering function",
    "actually , for the random energy model we have observed that the back and forth correlations are strongest for the fast particles such that this effect is indeed present there . whether it is this scenario or the above - discussed presence of energetic disorder , which dominates the different time dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath124 for lithium metasilicate , awaits further clarification .",
    "we have shown that the degree of heterogeneity depends on temperature .",
    "in contrast , the incoherent scattering function @xmath124 fulfills the time - temperature superposition principle .",
    "actually , the same observations have been made for glass - forming liquids @xcite .",
    "for these systems the non - exponentiality of @xmath124 mainly reflects the broad distribution of relaxation times .",
    "thus naively one would expect a lower value of the kww - exponent @xmath179 with increasing degree of heterogeneity .",
    "it still has to be shown why at least in the temperature range , accessible to simulations , this is not the case",
    ".    it may be interesting to compare our approach with that of habasaki and hiwatari @xcite .",
    "for the same system at t = 700 k they determined during 1 ns the distribution of square displacements of all particles .",
    "they observed a large variance , thus indicating some distribution of relaxation times . on a qualitative level",
    "this result is compatible with the results reported above .",
    "one advantage of the present approach is that via study of the @xmath18-dependence also information about length scales are available .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath180 has a direct interpretation in terms of local rate distributions .",
    "having identified several properties of the complex ion dynamics in quantitative terms one would like to relate them to more microscopic properties like the distribution of oxygens around the lithium ions and to see whether mainly the interaction among the different ions or the interaction with the basically static network gives rise to the observations reported in this work .    in this work",
    "we have profited from helpful discussions with c. cramer , k. funke , j. habasaki , h. lammert , and b. roling .",
    "calculation of @xmath181 proceeds in two steps .",
    "first we calculate the probability that a particle has moved by one unit to the right during some time @xmath40 . since we have two non - equivalent sites we have to calculate , on the one hand , the transition probability @xmath182 ( @xmath183 stands for even - odd ) from @xmath58 to @xmath184 and , on the other hand , the transition probability @xmath185 from @xmath184 to @xmath186 . in the second step",
    "we calculate the average motion @xmath187 ( starting , e.g. , from @xmath186 ) and @xmath188 ( starting , e.g. , from @xmath184 ) during the second time interval .",
    "one expects @xmath189 and @xmath190 and for reasons of symmetry @xmath191 which we abbreviate as @xmath192 . with this information",
    "we can finally calculate @xmath193    for the calculation of @xmath182 and @xmath185 we take into account that in the limit @xmath90 multiple transitions over the higher barrier can be neglected .",
    "we start with a particle either at @xmath194 or @xmath195 and we are interested in the probability to be at @xmath184 or @xmath186 after time @xmath40 , respectively . neglecting those terms , which are only relevant in case that a particle has crossed a high barrier at least twice , we end up with the following system of rate equations for the site populations @xmath196 @xmath197 this set of differential equations can be directly solved .",
    "@xmath182 can be identified as @xmath170 with initial condition @xmath58 and @xmath185 as @xmath171 with initial condition @xmath184 .",
    "one obtains after a short calculation @xmath198 and @xmath199.\\ ] ] thus we finally get ( using again @xmath86 ) @xmath200 and @xmath201    as a second ingredient we want to calculate @xmath192 which is the average coordinate @xmath202 after time @xmath34 for the initial condition @xmath58 . using the standard trick of introducing the functions @xmath203 and",
    "@xmath204 one can write down two linear differential equations involving @xmath205 and @xmath206    @xmath207    which can be solved with standard methods after specification of the initial condition . of interest for us",
    "is the expectation value @xmath202 for the initial condition @xmath208 .",
    "this expression can be calculated from @xmath209    it turns out @xmath210 which in the limit @xmath86 can be rewritten as @xmath211 .",
    "thus we have calculated all ingredients which are necessary for determination of @xmath93 .",
    "here we calculate the short - time limit of the random trap model .",
    "we always choose @xmath212 .",
    "we define the probability that a trap has the escape rate @xmath106 as @xmath196 . in equilibrium the probability that a particle is in a trap with escape rate @xmath106 is proportional to @xmath213",
    ". then we can write @xmath214 here @xmath215 denotes the probability that after time @xmath216 the particle has moved by one unit , starting in a trap with escape rate @xmath106 and @xmath217 the short - time expression for the mean square displacement , starting from a trap with rate @xmath218 .",
    "one simply has @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
