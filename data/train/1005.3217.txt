    "it is now more than 13 years ago that kilohertz ( khz ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were discovered ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in neutron star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems .",
    "interest in this phenomenon remains high because of the close correspondence between khz qpo timescales and typical dynamical timescales of matter orbiting close to a ns .",
    "for this reason , khz qpos are potential tools to probe general relativity in the strong - gravitational field regime @xcite , and constrain the ns equation of state @xcite .",
    "+ since the launch of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in 1995 , khz qpos have been detected in about 30 ns lmxbs ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "most of these sources show two simultaneous khz qpos , usually called the lower and the upper khz qpo , with frequencies that can drift as a function of time in the range 250 - 1200 hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies of these khz qpos show that qpo frequencies are related to other properties of the source ; e.g. on short time - scales ( within a day or less ) qpo frequencies are well correlated with the intensity of the source , whereas on long time - scales this correlation breaks down and intensity - frequency diagrams show the so - called `` parallel tracks '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the frequencies of the khz qpos correlate also with the position of the source in the colour - colour diagram , and with parameters of spectral components used to describe the x - ray spectrum of these sources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . nevertheless , it is still unclear which physical parameters drive the qpo frequency , although there are indications that mass accretion rate , @xmath2 , plays a key role @xcite .",
    "+ several models have been proposed to explain the khz qpos ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as the connection between high - frequency qpos and other time variability usually present in power density spectra ( for a review of variability at low frequencies see @xcite ) . despite these efforts ,",
    "there is still no single model that is able to explain in a self - consistent way all the qpo properties .",
    "+ khz qpos are characterised by three parameters : centroid frequency @xmath3 , quality factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the full - width at half - maximum of the qpo , and fractional rms amplitude .",
    "systematic analyses of these khz qpo properties have been done for a large number of sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "those studies show that , in each source the quality factor and the rms amplitude of the lower khz qpo increase with the centroid frequency of the qpo until they reach a maximum value , after which they decrease as the frequency continues to increase ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite for a compilation of results ) .",
    "the upper khz qpo does not show the same trend ; in this case the quality factor usually does not change with the centroid frequency while the rms amplitude stays more or less constant at lower frequencies and then decreases as the frequency increases ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . + @xcite and @xcite interpreted the drop of the quality factor of the lower khz qpo at high frequencies in the lmxbs 4u 1636536 and 4u 1608522 as a signature of the inner disk radius reaching the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , and starting from that assumption they estimated the mass and the radius of the compact object in these two systems .",
    "however , @xcite argued against this idea and suggested that the drop of @xmath6 and rms in individual sources might be related ( at least in part ) to changes of the properties of the accretion flow in these systems . + following those results , here",
    "we investigate the properties of the khz qpos for the transient ns lmxb xte j1701462 .",
    "this source was detected for the first time on 2006 january 18 with the all - sky monitor on - board rxte @xcite . as reported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "this is the only source so far that showed both z and atoll behaviour ( for more details about the z and atoll classes see @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity range covered by xte j1701462 , from eddington limit to quiescence , gives us a unique opportunity to study khz qpo properties in different states and , more importantly , at different mass accretion rates in the same system , which could provide vital information to understand the origin and the mechanisms that drive the properties of these qpos .",
    "+ in section 2 we describe the observations and the data analysis , and in section 3 we present our results . in section 4",

    "+ following @xcite and @xcite , we considered that xte j1701462 was in the z phase from its discovery in january 2006 @xcite until the end of april 2007 ( as reported by @xcite and @xcite , no clear boundary between z and atoll phase has been found which makes this date just an approximation ) , when it started to behave as an atoll source until it went into a quiescence state . using this division , there are 707 observations ( @xmath0 ms ) of xte j1701462 in the z phase , and 159 observations ( @xmath1 ms ) in the atoll phase .",
    "khz qpos were detected in individual observations only in the horizontal branch during the z phase , and in the lower banana in the atoll phase of the outburst ( see * ? ? ? * ) . from 14 observations with khz qpos ,",
    "8 belong to the z phase ( obsids are reported in table [ tab2 ] ) and 6 to the atoll phase ( observations : 93703 - 01 - 02 - 04 , 93703 - 01 - 02 - 11 , 93703 - 01 - 02 - 05 , 93703 - 01 - 02 - 08 , 93703 - 01 - 03 - 00 , and 93703 - 01 - 03 - 02 ) .",
    "+ a quick analysis of the observations showed clear differences in the properties of the qpos between z and atoll phases ( see  3 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the qpos were always weaker and broader in the z than in the atoll phase .",
    "it is well known that the frequency of the khz qpos can change over tens of hz in time intervals of a few hundred seconds ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this can artificially broaden the qpo in the averaged power spectrum of long observations . therefore , for each observation in which we found a khz qpo , we divided the observation in smaller intervals to check if a significant qpo was still present , and whether the qpo frequency was changing .",
    "we found that in the z phase it was not possible to detect a significant khz qpo in power spectra of intervals shorter than a full observation : in all observations in the z phase with khz qpos the qpos were weak and broad over short time intervals . therefore , for the rest of the analysis , for the z phase we report qpo properties for the average power density spectrum of each observation . in the atoll phase ,",
    "the khz qpos were significantly detected on time intervals shorter than a full observation , and in most cases the frequency was changing in time .",
    "therefore , for the atoll phase , we decided to average power density spectra according to the frequency of the qpo . to do this",
    "we produced power density spectra of 16s of data , and averaged up to 15 of these power spectra to get a significant detection of the khz qpo from which we measured the qpo frequency as a function of time .",
    "finally we averaged power density spectra such that the frequency of the qpo was within a range of 10 hz to 60 hz ( frequency intervals are reported in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we shifted the frequency scale of all these power density spectra in order to align the frequencies of the qpos to a constant value and then averaged the power density spectra to create one power density spectrum per selection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we fitted each z and atoll average power density spectrum in the frequency range 200 - 1200 hz using a constant to model the poisson noise plus one lorentzian to model the khz qpo .",
    "it must be clarified that , for the atoll phase , the centroid frequencies of the qpos reported in table [ tab1 ] are the mean frequencies within the interval selected , and the errors associated are the standard deviations of the selection . + in order to label the qpos we used the standard convention introduced by @xcite where each qpo is denoted with the letter _",
    "l _ with a subscript that specifies the category .",
    "in this particular case we were interested in khz qpos so we used @xmath61 and @xmath62 to identify the lower and the upper khz qpo , respectively . following this criterion",
    "all the characteristics associated with one qpo have the same label .",
    "+ we estimated the fractional rms amplitude of qpos in the atoll phase in different energy bands . for each observation with qpos",
    "we first created power density spectra in 5 different energy intervals : 2 - 3 kev , 3 - 6 kev , 6 - 11 kev , 11 - 16 kev and 16 - 25 kev ( we stopped at 25 kev because of the lack of sensitivity of the detector above that energy ) .",
    "we shifted and added the power density spectra creating one single power density spectrum for each energy band and we fitted these power density spectra as the atoll power density spectra previously described . to calculate the fractional rms amplitude we calculated the integral power of the lorentzian and we renormalised it using the source and background count rate ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+      we calculated x - ray colours and intensity of the source using the standard 2 mode data .",
    "we defined a hard colour as the count rate ratio in the energy bands 9.7 - 16.0 kev and 6.0 - 9.7 kev , and the intensity of the source as the count rate in the energy band 2.0 - 16.0 kev . to obtain the exact count rate in each of these bands we interpolated in channel space .",
    "+ to correct for the gain changes and differences in the effective area between the proportional counter units ( pcus ) as well as differences due to changes in the channel to energy conversion of the pcus as a function of time , we normalised our colour and intensity by the crab nebula values obtained close in time to our observations and per pcu ( see @xcite and @xcite for details )",
    ". finally we averaged the normalised colours and intensities per pcu every 16 seconds using all available pcus .",
    "+ we also calculated the source luminosity for all 14 observations containing khz qpos . in order to do so",
    ", we first created a light curve for each observation , we then checked for x - ray bursts and detector drop - outs , and if any were present we eventually excluded them from the analysis . using standard 2 data we extracted energy spectra following the procedures described in the rxte web page , and",

    "as already noticed for the quality factor , the rms amplitude values show a clear difference between the atoll and z phases : the lower khz qpos amplitude in the atoll phase is on average a factor of 2 higher than in the z phase ; this difference is also apparent in the region where atoll and z qpos overlap in frequency between 620 hz and 660 hz .",

    "here we found that the properties of the khz qpos in xte j1701462 in the atoll and z phases are significantly different : at approximately the same frequency ( about 640 hz ) , the coherence of the khz qpos is a factor of 2 larger , and the rms amplitude is a factor of 3 larger , in the atoll than in the z phase ( see figure 3 and figure 4 , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , out of 707 observations in the z phase , there is no single one in which the khz qpos have a coherence or rms amplitude similar to those seen when xte j1701462 was in the atoll phase , even though the total exposure time was about 5 times longer in the z than in the atoll phase .",
    "if the khz qpos reflect the motion of matter in the accretion disk , and the qpo centroid frequency is related to the radius in the accretion disk where this motion takes place , our results show that , at least in xte j1701462 there is no unique relation between the radius of the disk at which the qpo is produced and the coherence and rms amplitude of the qpo .",
    "+ it was already known that the khz qpos are broader and weaker in z than in atoll sources ( see mndez 2006 for a compilation ) , but this is the first time that the same trend is observed in a single source .",
    "this result conclusively excludes things like neutron - star mass , magnetic field , spin , inclination of the accretion disk , etc .",
    ", as the cause of this trend , since these parameters can not change on time scales of one and half year .",
    "as we discuss below , the most likely reason for the difference of qpo coherence and rms amplitude between the z and atoll phase in xte j1701462 is a change in the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star where the qpos are produced . despite the the lack of information about the precise mechanism",
    ", our result shows that effects other than the geometry of space time around the neutron star have a strong effect on the qpo properties .",
    "if , as suggested by @xcite , the isco affects the coherence and rms amplitude of the khz qpos , our result shows that there are other mechanisms that should also be taken into account to explain the trend seen in the data .",
    "for instance , in xte j1701462 the coherence and rms amplitude differ by a factor of @xmath107 to 10 between the z and atoll phases similar , for instance , to the change of coherence and rms amplitude that has been proposed to be due to the isco in 4u 163653 @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite found that the the behaviour of the coherence and rms amplitude of the khz qpos in individual sources is similar to the behaviour of the maximum coherence and maximum rms of the khz qpos as a function of the luminosity in a sample of 12 ns - lmxbs .",
    "it is interesting to test to what extent this luminosity relation holds for the z and atoll phases of xte j1701462 , which are well separated in luminosity . in figure [ max ]",
    "we combine the data points from the z and atoll phases of xte j1701462 with those of the 12 ns - lmxbs studied by @xcite . +    the upper and the lower panels show respectively the maximum quality factor and the maximum rms amplitude of the lower khz qpo for 13 sources as a function of the luminosity of the source in the 2 - 50 kev range , normalised by the eddington luminosity , l@xmath108 erg s@xmath109 , corresponding to a neutron star of 1.9 m@xmath110 accreting gas with cosmic abundance . as it is apparent from the plots , xte j1701462 follows the trends already traced by the other sources ; moreover the coherence of the khz qpos in the z phase fill the gap between the atoll sources in the left - hand side and the z sources in the right - hand side of the graph , strengthening the correlation .",
    "( notice , however that the luminosity of xte j1701462 could be uncertain by up to a factor of @xmath59 2 , @xcite ) .",
    "+ besides differences of the khz qpos properties between z and atoll sources , figure [ max ] shows also a trend of both @xmath6 and rms amplitude within the atoll sources .",
    "this is noticeable in the lower panel of figure 5 of @xcite , where the maximum coherence and maximum rms amplitude of the lower khz qpo are plotted vs. each other . from that plot",
    "it is apparent that the two quantities both in z and atoll sources follow the same correlation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that there is a single mechanism behind this trend .",
    "our observations of xte j170462 in the z and atoll phase are in line with this .",
    "+ we can qualitatively explain how it is possible to find high rms amplitudes of khz qpos at energies where the contribution of the disk is insignificant . as reported by @xcite , the rms amplitude of the lower khz qpo in the lmxb 4u 160852 increases with energy up to 20% ( fraction of the total emitted flux ) at energies around 30 kev , significantly above the energy range where the accretion disk contributes to the x - ray spectrum ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . if the khz qpos are produced in the accretion disk , this must imply the presence of a mechanism that amplifies the variability at different energy bands .",
    "some mechanisms have been proposed for this : @xcite found that oscillations of the density and temperature of the comptonizing medium can reproduce the rms amplitude behaviour of the lower khz qpo in the atoll source 4u 160852 .",
    "@xcite , from the analysis of the z source gx340 + 0 , suggest that qpos are related to the contribution of the boundary layer emission to the total source emission .",
    "@xcite found that as @xmath2 increases from the horizontal branch to the flaring branch along the z - shaped track in the colour - colour diagram of gx 340 + 0 , the contribution of the boundary layer decreases . if we combine the results of @xcite and @xcite , and we apply them to the case of xte j1701462 , we would expect the boundary - layer contribution to be stronger in the atoll phase than the in z phase . to verify this",
    ", we used the spectral analysis of xte j1701462 done by @xcite ; their figures 14 and 15 show the spectral fitting results , respectively , of the atoll and the z phase . from their figure 14",
    "we notice that in the atoll phase the blackbody ( bb ) component used by @xcite to fit the boundary - layer emission becomes dominant , while the emission from the disk ( fitted with a multi colour disk blackbody , mcd ) becomes negligible . comparing this with their figure 15",
    ", we found that the fractional contribution of the boundary - layer emission in the atoll phase is higher than in the z phase , which is in agreement with the results of @xcite , and can also explain the fact that we found stronger khz qpos in the atoll phase than in the z phase .",
    "if this is correct , we should expect that most of the variability concentrates in the energy band where the boundary - layer emission peaks . from figure 14 of @xcite ,",
    "the bb temperature is about 2 kev , which implies that the peak of the boundary - layer emission is at about 10 kev . according to the results shown in the previous section , the atoll fractional rms amplitude increases as the energy increases , up to about 20% in the energy band 16 - 25 kev .",
    "we test whether the fractional rms amplitude we found above 10 kev is compatible with the fractional contribution of the boundary layer emission to the total emission of the source . from the spectral",
    "fits shown by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 12 panel  atoll ss  ) , the bb contributes more than 30% of the total emission in the 10 - 25 kev band , which means that the picture where the amplitude and coherence of the khz qpos are driven by the boundary layer is still consistent at those energies .",
    "further studies should address the fact the khz qpos are only detected over narrow regions in the colour - colour diagram .",
    "+    adding all these together , we suggest a possible scenario to describe the behaviour of the properties of the khz qpo .",
    "mathematically a lorentzian ( which is usually used to model quasi - periodic oscillations ) is the fourier transform of an exponentially damped sinusoid signal , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the amplitude of the signal , @xmath113 is the life time of the variability , @xmath3 is the frequency of the oscillation , and @xmath114 is an arbitrary phase . starting from this mathematical expression",
    "we can build a qualitative mechanism to describe the behaviour of the quality factor and the rms of the khz qpo .",
    "most of the models proposed to explain the khz qpos , consider the disk as the most probable location where those qpos are generated ( e.g. @xcite ) . under this assumption , the above expression could represent the oscillator that generates the qpo in the disk and sets its frequency @xmath3 .",
    "since the rms amplitude of khz qpos depends on energy , we should introduce an energy - dependent amplification factor @xmath115 which should be physically related to the mechanism which generates high - energy photons .",
    "for example , this could be related to the properties of the comptonizing medium @xcite or to the contribution of the boundary - layer emission to the total emission of the source @xcite .",
    "the life time @xmath113 drives the qpo width , and as the amplitude , also this could be energy dependent . additionally , we should consider that each process that amplifies the variability could also modify the life time of the variability .",
    "just to give an example , if the qpo is created in the disk , and later on the qpo photons interact with matter in the corona , the final width of the qpo will be the result from the combination of the two process . in our model this",
    "would imply a lifetime for the qpo @xmath116 . with these considerations , the modulated flux in the khz qpo",
    "could be described by the expression @xmath117 .",
    "this simple expression describes the rms amplitude and coherence of the qpo in terms of the quantities @xmath115 and @xmath118 , which in turn could depend on the properties of the boundary layer .",
    "the above expression would reproduce the behaviour of the rms amplitude and coherence if , for instance , @xmath115 and @xmath118 depended upon mass accretion rate , @xmath119 , such that @xmath115 and @xmath118 decreased as @xmath119 increased .",
    "the previous description does not resolve however the issue of which processes are involved , or what the key mechanisms are that create or amplify the qpo signal .",
    "nevertheless , this qualitative explanation provides a starting point to build a realistic model to explain the khz qpo properties .",
    "+ for most of the considerations in this paper we assumed that the only khz qpo in the atoll phase is the lower khz qpo .",
    "although it is very unlikely ( see section [ res ] ) , if it instead was the upper khz qpo , one would have to explain the fact that in the frequency range , from 740 hz to 860 hz , the atoll khz qpos show @xmath6 and rms values significantly different than those of the z phase khz qpos ( figures [ q_nu ] and [ r_nu ] ) .",
    "+ from the integral catalog ( integral general reference catalog , version 30 ) we found no other sources within 1 square degree of the position of xte j1701462 .",
    "the closest source reported ( about 2.3 degrees away from xte j1701462 ) is the gamma - ray source 2egs j1653 - 4604 that does not show x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite observed xte j1701462 in outburst with the chandra s high - resolution camera ( hrc - s ) in timing mode and they did not find evidence of other sources in the hrc - s field of view ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "swift observations with the x - ray telescope as well as xmm newton observations of xte j1701462 did not show other sources , respectively within @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "finally we checked the rxte galactic bulge scans archive and we found that with a spatial accuracy of @xmath123 no sources have been detected in a 1 square degree area from the xte 1701 - 462 position .",
    "the evidence just discussed indicates that most likely the outburst observed by rxte was due to a single source , xte j1701462 , switching from z to atoll . +",
    "another interesting aspect to mention is the mismatch of the frequency of the lower khz qpos between the two different phases of the source .",
    "it is clear from tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab1 ] and figures [ q_nu ] and [ r_nu ] that z phase lower khz qpos are in the range @xmath124 hz , while in the atoll phase the lower khz qpos are in the frequency range @xmath125 hz .",
    "although a similar effect has been observed when one compares other atoll and z sources ( see @xcite for a compilation ) , we have now shown this effect in a single source .",
    "studying the energy spectra in different parts of the colour - colour diagram , @xcite found that in the z phase the disk is truncated far from the ns surface and its inner radius could be set by the local eddington limit , while in the atoll phase the disk extends closer to the ns .",
    "different sizes of the inner radius of the accretion disk could explain the different range of khz qpo frequencies .",
    "however we can not discard the presence of other lower khz qpos in the z phase at frequencies higher than what we found . from the upper limits for the z phase reported in section [ res ] ,",
    "it is apparent that we are not sensitive enough to detect broad and weak qpos at high frequencies in that phase .",
    "we studied the properties of the khz qpos in the transient source xte j1701462 , the only source so far that during an outburst underwent a transition from z to atoll class .",
    "we found that :    * most of the time , when there are khz qpos in the z phase , the power spectrum shows two simultaneous khz qpos , whereas in the atoll phase there is only one khz qpo that we identify as the lower khz qpo . * the coherence and fractional rms amplitude of the khz qpos are significantly different between the z and atoll phases .",
    "atoll lower khz qpos show quality factors and fractional rms amplitude , respectively , 2 and 3 times larger than the z ones in the same frequency range .",
    "* there is no single z observation in which the khz qpos have a coherence or rms amplitude similar to those seen when xte j1701462 was in the atoll phase , even though the total exposure time was about 5 times longer in the z than in the atoll phase . *",
    "the difference in qpo properties can not be due to quantities like neutron - star mass , magnetic field , spin , inclination of the accretion disk , etc .",
    "we suggest that this difference is due to a change in the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star where the qpos are produced .",
    "we conclude that , at least in xte j1701462 the coherence and rms amplitude of the khz qpos are not uniquely driven by the radius in the accretion disk in which qpos are most probably created . +",
    "our results show that effects other than the geometry of the space time around the neutron star have a strong influence on the qpo properties .",
