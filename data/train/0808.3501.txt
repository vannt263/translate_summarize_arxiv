    "ob associations typically contain a few 10 massive stars . the combined actions of fast stellar winds and core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions of the member stars create large ( @xmath4  pc ) shell - like structures , called superbubbles ( sbs ) , by sweeping up the ambient medium ( e.g. , mac low & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "therefore , sbs are very energetic objects which store a large amount of energy injected from massive stars ; the swept up interstellar medium ( ism ) can be successively heated to high temperature by stellar winds and/or sne .",
    "furthermore , large tenuous cavities created inside the sb walls allow that the blast shocks of the interior supernova remnants ( snrs ) expand rapidly without decelerating for a long time .",
    "therefore , the timescale of efficient cosmic - ray acceleration can be much longer than that of most isolated snrs .",
    "for the study of snrs and sbs , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is an ideal site , because of little foreground extinction and well - known distance ( 50  kpc : alves 2004 ) .",
    "dunne , points , chu  ( 2001 ) systematically studied several sbs in the lmc using rosat , and showed their x - ray emissions are brighter than that theoretically expected for a wind - blown bubble .",
    "this fact suggests that the x - ray emitting walls of the sbs are re - heated by the shock of interior snrs , and hence the emissions are enhanced .",
    "they also found that the plasma temperatures of the shocked sb walls are typically of the order of 0.1  kev .",
    "30  dor  c , located in the southwestern region of the 30  doradus complex , is one of the sbs in the lmc identified by the morphology of the h@xmath5 emission ( mathewson et al .",
    "1985 ; kennicutt & hodge 1986 ) .",
    "this sb hosts an ob association lh  90 , with the age of a few myr ( lucke & hodge 1970 ) .",
    "a shell - like structure with a diameter of @xmath6 ( @xmath7  pc at 50  kpc distance ) was discovered by the radio observation ( mills et al .",
    "1984 ) .",
    "x - rays from 30  dor  c were first detected with the einstein satellite ( long et al .",
    "1981 ) . then",
    ", dunne , points , chu  ( 2001 ) found a clear shell - like structure confined within the h@xmath5 shell by the rosat observation .",
    "they thus concluded that the x - ray emission arises from the interaction between the sb and an interior snr .",

    "they found that the total luminosity of the synchrotron emission was @xmath8 times larger than that of sn  1006 ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 ) , and hence argued that the large energy supply was probably by multiple sn explosions .",
    "this paper reports the x - ray observation of 30  dor  c with suzaku ( mitsuda et al .",

    ", we study the detailed properties of the thermal and non - thermal emissions from 30  dor  c. the distance to the lmc is assumed to be 50  kpc , following alves  ( 2004 ) .",
    "suzaku observed sn  1987a on 2005 november 3 ( observation i d = 500006010 ; hereafter obs .  1 ) and",
    "on 2006 june 8 ( observation i d = 801090010 ; hereafter obs .  2 ) .",
    "in both of the observations , the 30  dor  c region was in the field of view ( fov ) of x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : koyama et al .",
    "this paper concentrates on the imaging and spectral features of 30  dor  c obtained with the xis .",
    "the results of sn  1987a will be reported in separate paper .",
    "three of the xis are front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and the remaining one is a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "the former have high sensitivity and low background for diffuse sources in the hard x - ray band of @xmath9  510  kev , while the latter has high sensitivity in the soft x - ray band below 1  kev .",
    "all the ccds are placed on the foci of the x - ray telescopes ( xrt : serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) which co - aligned to image the same region of the sky .",
    "a half - power diameter ( hpd ) of the xrt is @xmath10 , independent of the x - ray energy .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode during both of the observations .",
    "we employed cleaned revision 2.0 data , which includes column - to - column correction of the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) measured using the charge - injection ( ci ) capability ( nakajima et al .",
    "we used the headas software version 6.4 for the data reduction and analysis .",

    "since a dense molecular cloud is located at the north region of our fov ( the nanten co observation : yamaguchi et al .",
    "2001 ) , the low energy ( 0.41.0 kev ) deficiency in region  c would be due to the local interstellar absorption in the lmc .",
    "the excess in 0.71.5 kev of region  b spectrum is particularly clear at the energies of the k - shell emission lines of ne , ne , and mg , and fe l - shell blends .",

    "2001 ) , which is partially included in the region  b area , although no clear structure is found in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "we thus assumed that region  a represents a proper local background for 30  dor  c. however , the local absorption may be variable from position to position , and hence we applied the spectra analysis as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) non x - ray background ( nxb ) was constructed from the data base of night - earth by sorting with the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) from the same region on the detector coordinates of our observation ( see tawa et al .",

    "these may be the lower limit of the age . on the other hand , in order to emit intense synchrotron x - rays , the shock speed higher than @xmath96  km  s@xmath38 is required by the standard diffusive shock acceleration theory ( e.g. , aharonian & atoyan 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , the upper limit of the age is estimated to be @xmath82  yr .",
    "we thus conclude that the age of 30  dor  c would be between @xmath95  yr and @xmath82  yr ; 30  dor  c is the oldest among the known non - thermal snrs .",
    "our observation demonstrates even older - system can be a site of higher energy acceleration than typical young snrs , such as sn  1006 .",
    "rcw  86 is another shell - like snr with non - thermal shell , which has a relatively old age of @xmath97  yr .",
    "similarly to 30  dor  c , rcw  86 also coincides with the ob association , and is considered to be fast expanding inside the large cavity ( vink et al .",
    "2006 ; yamaguchi et al .",
    "the long timescales of the efficient acceleration , achieved in 30  dor  c and rcw  86 , would be due to the extremely low density of the cavity created inside the sb shell ; the snrs in sbs can be better cosmic - ray accelerator than the isolated snrs in homogeneous ism .",
    "non - thermal x - rays had been detected from other star - forming regions , rcw  38 ( wolk et al .",
    "2002 ) and westerlund  1 ( muno et al .  2006 ) in our galaxy , and dem  l192 ( n51d : cooper et al .",
    "2004 ) in the lmc . however , the emissions from these regions show center - filled morphologies , in contrast to those from 30  dor  c and rcw  86",
    ". moreover , their photon indexes ( e.g. , @xmath98 for dem  l192 ) are lower ( harder ) than those of typical shell - like snrs .",
    "therefore , the origins of these emissions are still unclear .",
    "future detailed studies of the thermal and non - thermal properties of these star - forming regions using sensitive observatory , such as suzaku , would help to reveal their origins .",
    "observations of more sbs are also necessary to determine if non - thermal emissions are commonly present or not in sb regions .",
    "we have analyzed suzaku / xis data of 30  dor  c. the results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the west rim is dominated by the non - thermal emission , whereas the se and ne rims show the thermal and non - thermal emissions .",
    "the spectrum from the west rim is well - reproduced by a power - law with spectral cutoff .",
    "the cutoff frequency of @xmath0  hz is the highest , although the age is the oldest , among the known shell - like snrs with non - thermal emission .",
    "the thermal components of the se and ne spectra are well - represented by the plasma at a collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the electron temperature of the thermal plasma in the se rim ( @xmath2  kev ) is found to be higher than the value of the previous report .",
    "the authors would like to thank the suzaku science working group and the members of suzaku sn  1987a team .",
    "we also thank yasunobu uchiyama for his useful comments .",
    "is supported by the special postdoctoral researchers program in riken .",
