    "what degree the holonomy determines the projective strucuture .",
    "even when the representation is discrete and faithful there are many different projective structures with that representation as its holonomy .",
    "examples of this sort are constructed using a cut - and - paste operation called _ grafting _ which glues a projective structure on an annulus to a projective structure @xmath14 on @xmath4 .",
    "this is done by first splitting @xmath4 open along a suitable curve and attaching the annulus to @xmath4 along its boundary .",
    "there are many suitable curves for grafting , and this gives rise to many different projective structures .",
    "a key feature of grafting is that the result is again a projective structure on @xmath4 with the same holonomy as @xmath14 .",
    "a standard projective structure is one whose developing map is a covering map onto its image , or equivalently , one that can not be realized as a graft of another .",
    "two projective structures are said to differ by an elementary move if they differ by a power of a dehn twist about a curve with trivial holonomy .",
    "goldman @xcite has shown that any projective structures with faithful fuchsian holonomy can be obtained by grafting one of the two standard fuchsian projective structures along a unique set of admissible curves .",
    "recently baba @xcite has proved an analogous result for the case that the holonomy is onto a schottky group .",
    "[ baba ] [ baba ] every projective structure on @xmath4 with schottky holonomy @xmath1 is obtained by grafting a standard structure once along a multiloop on @xmath4 .",
    "this theorem implies that @xmath0 is connected if @xmath15 is a schottky group .",
    "the lack of uniquess in theorem [ baba ] is due to the fact that , in this case , there are many standard projective structures with the same holonomy .",
    "our results exploit this profusion of standard projective structures .",
    "one of the main results of this paper imply that any two projective structures which differ by an elementary move can be grafted to a common structure , in an infinite number of ways .",
    "[ iterated connectivity 1 ] if @xmath14 and @xmath16 are standard real schottky projective structures that differ by an elementary move then there are an infinite number of structures which are grafts of both .",
    "the result above implies that @xmath2 is not finitely generated . since there are an infinite number of standard structures which differ by an elementary move there we also show the following .",

    "real representations have several features which make this study more accessible .",

    "complex projective structures with real holonomy are classified by the homotopy classes of their real curves.theorem [ flatsharp 1 ] shows that real curves of certain ( spiral ) grafted structures are obtained from the original real curves using surgery operations .",
    "we will show that the @xmath37 and @xmath38 operations on spiraling curves in @xmath4 reduce to @xmath37 and @xmath38 operations on curves in a torus . in the torus these operations are closely related to dehn twists , and this implies that the real curves produced by grafting can be constructed by dehn twists of the inital real curves about a meridian in @xmath4 which intersects the real curves exaclty twice .",
    "this technical condition on @xmath41 makes it easy to see the relationship to spiraling curves .",
    "powers of dehn twists correspond to higher frequencies of spiraling .",
