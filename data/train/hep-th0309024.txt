    "tachyon condensation is one of most interesting and important subject in the recent development in string theory . after the connection between the open string tachyon field and unstable d - branes",
    "was conjectured by sen@xcite , our understanding of dynamics of d - branes has been greatly deepened .",
    "having looked at this success , many people anticipate that the closed string tachyon field also has clues to non - perturbative dynamics of string theory .",
    "although the role of closed string tachyon condensation in string theory is not as clear as that of open string , several ideas have been proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "relation between instability of fluxbranes and closed string tachyon condensation is discussed . in @xcite , it is suggested that condensation of tachyonic twisted modes localized at fixed points of non - supersymmetric orbifolds like @xmath1 and @xmath2 give rise to deformations of geometries of the background spacetimes .",
    "configurations bringing with localized tachyons are also discussed in many works@xcite .    in this paper , we study localized tachyonic modes on a type 0 ns5-brane . type 0 string theory includes the closed string tachyon field in the bulk . in order to remove the instability associated with it , we compactify one spacelike direction of the background spacetime on @xmath0 with a twisted boundary condition for left - moving worldsheet fermions .",
    "because the bulk tachyon field changes its sign under this twist , it becomes massive when the compactification radius is sufficiently small .",
    "we will show in this paper that even in such a situation there are localized tachyonic modes on an unwrapped ns5-brane and it decays into a bubble of nothing@xcite .",
    "one way to obtain a spectrum of fields localized on an ns5-brane is to analyze fluctuations around a corresponding classical solution of the einstein equation . in @xcite ,",
    "a type 0 ns5-brane is mapped to a type 0 kaluza - klein monopole by using type 0/type 0 t - duality@xcite , and a non - chiral spectrum on an ns5-brane is obtained as zero - modes of massless fields in type 0 string theory .    in section 2 and 3",
    ", we adopt a similar way to show the existence of a tachyonic mode on an ns5-brane . because we assume twisted boundary condition on @xmath0 for the bulk tachyon , t - duality maps an unwrapped type 0 ns5-brane into type ii string theory with a spacetime geometry similar to a two - centered kaluza - klein monopole@xcite .",
    "we describe it in detail in the next section , and show in section 3 that it decays with creating a bubble of nothing at the center of the manifold .    in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze fluctuations of the closed string tachyon field on an ns5-brane classical solution and show that there exist localized tachyonic modes , however small the compactification radius .",
    "we will find that its tachyonic mass is of the same order with what obtained in section 3 and we conjecture that the closed string tachyon condensation on an ns5-brane is responsible for the instability of the geometry .",
    "the last section is devoted for discussions .",
    "we mention there about similarity and difference between our geometry and monopole - anti monopole pair creation studied in other works .",
    "in this section we construct a four - dimensional manifold such that @xmath3 is the t - dual of a unwrapped type 0 ns5-brane by combining two hyper - khler manifolds .",
    "it is known that there are two smooth four - dimensional hyper - khler manifolds with locally @xmath4 isometry@xcite .",
    "the word ` locally ' means that at this point we do not distinguish @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "one of two manifolds is taub - nut manifold ( @xmath7 ) and the other is eguchi - hanson manifold ( @xmath8 ) . by looking at the global structure of these manifolds , we find that isometry of @xmath8 is @xmath9 while that of @xmath7 is @xmath4 .",
    "correspondingly , isometry orbits for generic points are topologically @xmath10 for @xmath8 and @xmath11 for @xmath7 .",
    "these four - dimensional manifolds are parameterized by three angular coordinate on @xmath11 or @xmath10 and radius @xmath12 .",
    "we define the coordinate @xmath12 as a geodesic distance from the center of the manifolds .",
    "( the `` center '' means nut for @xmath7 or bolt for @xmath8 . )    in what follows , we construct a `` composite manifold '' @xmath13 by pasting the large @xmath12 part of @xmath7 and the small @xmath12 part of @xmath8 . in order for two manifolds to join smoothly",
    ", the topology of their sections must be the same and the metrics of two manifolds should be appropriately deformed so as to interpolate inside and outside smoothly . to obtain the same topology of the sections of two manifolds",
    ", we will use @xmath14 rather than @xmath7 itself .",
    "( @xmath15 is the center of the @xmath6 factor in the isometry group . ) then , both the sections are @xmath10 , and these can be represented as an @xmath0 fibration over @xmath16 ( hopf fibration ) with first chern class @xmath17 . although the orbifold @xmath14 is singular at its center , it does not matter because we will only use the large @xmath12 part of the manifold .",
    "each metric of two manifolds @xmath14 and @xmath8 includes one scale parameter .",
    "we denote them by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . for @xmath14",
    ", @xmath18 represents the radius of @xmath0 fiber at @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath19 represents the size of @xmath16 at the bolt ( the place where @xmath0 fiber shrinks to a point ) of @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider a situation where @xmath18 is much larger than @xmath19 .",
    "in this situation , there is an intermediate scale @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "if we look at the intermediate region @xmath23 , both these manifolds are approximately @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we can construct a composite manifold @xmath25 by combining @xmath26 part of @xmath8 and @xmath27 part of @xmath14 .",
    "of cause we need to deform two manifolds to obtain a smooth manifold .",
    "but the deformation becomes smaller as the ratio @xmath28 becomes larger .    if we start from an orbifold @xmath24 around the intermediate region and extend it to interior @xmath8 or to exterior @xmath14 , we can choose one of two `` orientations '' .",
    "one way to see this is to look at the relation between isometry of the intermediate region and that of the internal or external region .",
    "the isometry of @xmath24 is @xmath29 . by the extension to the internal or external region",
    ", this symmetry is broken to @xmath9 .",
    "there are two choices of an unbroken @xmath5 from @xmath30 and these correspond to two orientations of extension .",
    "we refer to an extension as `` left - handed '' if it preserves @xmath31 , and the opposite extension as `` right - handed '' . because we have two choices for both internal and external extensions , we obtain four different composite manifolds . however , we are interested only in the relative orientation and there are two essentially different composite manifolds .",
    "each constituent manifold @xmath14 or @xmath8 possesses three complex structures @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) satisfying @xmath34 .",
    "we call a set of these three complex structures hyper - khler structure .",
    "it is important to know if it is possible to preserve the hyper - khler structure on the composite manifold after an appropriate deformation of the metric . to obtain some information about this problem ,",
    "let us think of the relation between isometries and hyper - khler structures .",
    "an important property of the hyper - khler structure on @xmath14 and that on @xmath8 is that the former belongs to @xmath35 of @xmath5 isometry while the latter is an @xmath5 singlet . from this fact",
    ", we can make a guess as follows .",
    "if a composite manifold consists of two manifolds with the same orientation ( left - handed@xmath36left - handed or right - handed@xmath36right - handed ) , the same @xmath5 is preserved by the internal and external regions .",
    "this means that two parts of the manifold respect different hyper - khler structures .",
    "therefore , the entire manifold would not possess any hyper - khler structure .",
    "we call this manifold @xmath5-symmetric composite manifold and denote it as @xmath37 . on the other hand , if the orientations of the internal and external parts are opposite ( left - handed@xmath36right - handed or right - handed@xmath36left - handed ) , although the two parts respect the different @xmath5 isometries , these respect the same hyper - khler structure .",
    "this strongly suggests the existence of an appropriate deformation of metric preserving a hyper - khler structure .",
    "indeed , we can identify this manifold with a two - centered taub - nut manifold and the parameter @xmath19 determines the distance between the two centers .",
    "we call this manifold hyper - khler composite manifold and denote it as @xmath38 .    we can represent @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath0 fibrations on asymptotically flat three - dimensional base manifolds . in the hyper - khler case ,",
    "as we mentioned above , the manifold @xmath38 is a two - centered taub - nut , and the base manifold is @xmath39 . for @xmath5-symmetric manifold @xmath37",
    ", the base manifold is parameterized by two angular coordinates on @xmath16 ( base manifold of hopf fibration of @xmath10 ) and the radius of the @xmath16 . because the radius is bounded below by @xmath19 , the base manifold is @xmath39 with solid @xmath16 with radius @xmath19 omitted .",
    "this is a `` bubble of nothing''@xcite .",
    "let us consider compactifications of type ii string theory on these composite manifolds .",
    "as we mentioned above , the composite manifolds @xmath37 and @xmath38 have the same asymptotic form at large @xmath12 .",
    "they are @xmath0-fibrations over flat @xmath39 .",
    "because the @xmath0-cycles are shrinkable in both manifolds , the boundary conditions around the @xmath0 for fermions are uniquely determined",
    ". we can easily show that it is periodic for @xmath38 and anti - periodic for @xmath37@xcite . by the t - duality along the @xmath0 ,",
    "these configurations are transformed to @xmath0 compactified type ii theory ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath0 compactified type 0 theory ( @xmath37)@xcite . the central parts of the manifolds are mapped to unwrapped ns5-branes in both cases . a detailed consideration of the relation of compactification radii , string winding numbers and kaluza - klein momenta shows that the number of ns5-branes is two for @xmath38 and one for @xmath37@xcite .",
    "by taking advantage of this duality , we analyze the stability of a type 0 ns5-brane in the next section .",
    "in this section we analyze the stability of the @xmath5-symmetric composite manifold @xmath37 , which is the t - dual to a type 0 ns5-brane .",
    "we keep the parameter @xmath18 fixed as a boundary condition because it represents the radius of the @xmath0 fiber at @xmath40 .",
    "the other scale parameter @xmath19 is treated as a deformation parameter of the manifold .",
    "we assume here that the background geometry is @xmath41 , the dilaton is constant , and all the other fields vanish . by taking a certain ansatz for the metric of the composite manifold , and computing einstein - hilbert lagrangian",
    ", we can define an effective potential @xmath42 and the configuration turns out to be unstable .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath19 plays a role of a tachyon field localized near the center of the manifold . because @xmath19 also represents the radius of a bubble , we conclude that a type 0 ns5-brane decays into a bubble of nothing .    for each value of @xmath19",
    ", we have a pair of @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "thanks to the @xmath9 isometry , the metrics of both manifolds are written in the following form .",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the maurer - cartan one - forms on @xmath5 group manifold defined by @xmath47 the ranges of angular coordinates are @xmath48 in the case of @xmath6 group manifold , the period of @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "now this is halved due to the @xmath15 orbifolding .",
    "one way to determine the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath14 and @xmath8 is to solve the einstein equation .",
    "however , it is more convenient to use the fact that the spin connection obtained from ( [ fgmetric ] ) admits a hyper - khler structure .",
    "because hyper - khler structures of @xmath14 and @xmath8 are transformed under @xmath5 isometry in different ways , first - order differential equations for two manifolds are different .",
    "@xmath53 by solving these equations , we obtain the following relations between @xmath54 and @xmath55 for each manifold .",
    "( see also figure [ gplot.eps ] . )",
    "@xmath56    let us concretely give a metric interpolating @xmath8 and @xmath14 . as a simplest choice , we use the following metric which is obtained by simply connecting @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent the radial coordinate at the intersection in figure [ gplot.eps ] and are defined by the following junction condition .",
    "@xmath62 because our purpose is to show only the existence of a tachyonic mode , this special choice of the interpolating metric is sufficient . at @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "are not continuous and this manifold is singular .",
    "indeed the scalar curvature for the metric ( [ fgmetric ] ) @xmath66 diverges at @xmath63 . however , this divergence has a @xmath67-function - like form and the lagrangian @xmath68 is finite .",
    "the overall factor @xmath69 in ( [ ehlag ] ) includes the dilaton factor @xmath70 and the five - dimensional spatial integral transverse to @xmath37 . because the interpolating manifold is ricchi flat for @xmath71 , and the second term in ( [ curvature ] ) is everywhere finite , only contribution to the lagrangian comes from the first term in ( [ curvature ] ) at the singularity @xmath63 and we obtain @xmath72^{r_0+\\epsilon}_{r_0-\\epsilon }   = -16\\pi^2n(f(r_0)-g(r_0))^2 . \\label{potential}\\ ] ] in the last step in ( [ potential ] ) , we used the relations ( [ killing ] ) .",
    "this is clearly non - positive . for large @xmath19 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 at the junction point approach to @xmath19 and @xmath18 , respectively",
    "( see figure [ gplot.eps ] ) .",
    "this implies that the potential is unbounded below .",
    "a solution of the junction condition ( [ junction ] ) for small @xmath19 is @xmath73 substituting this into the potential ( [ potential ] ) , we obtain the following potential for small @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath74 in order to determine the mass of this mode , we need to know the kinetic term of the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "up to a numerical constant , it is determined to be @xmath75 by a dimensional analysis .",
    "therefore , the potential ( [ vreh ] ) implies that the unstable mode parameterized by @xmath19 has a tachyonic mass @xmath76 although we can not determine the numerical coefficient in ( [ m2mso3 ] ) from the potential ( [ vreh ] ) because of the artificial choice of the metric , we can conclude that there exists at least one unstable mode with the non - vanishing tachyonic mass .",
    "once we know this , the relation ( [ m2mso3 ] ) is immediately obtained by a dimensional analysis and it is expected that ( [ m2mso3 ] ) still holds if we carry out more detailed analysis of decay modes .",
    "in the previous section , we showed in the t - dual picture that a type 0 ns5-brane is unstable and decays to a bubble of nothing .",
    "it is natural to ask what is responsible for this instability on the type 0 side .",
    "it is already shown in @xcite that there are localized tachyonic modes on coincident unwrapped ns5-branes in type 0 theory compactified on @xmath0 .",
    "this result is obtained by solving the klein - gordon equation for the closed string tachyon field on the background . in @xcite ,",
    "only the small compactification limit is considered and it is shown that the spectrum of the localized tachyonic modes is identical to the spectrum of twisted string modes at an @xmath77 type singularity , which is t - dual to the ns5-branes . in the case of single ns5-brane , there is no tachyonic modes and the lightest localized modes are massless in the small radius limit@xcite .    the compactification radius @xmath78 in type @xmath79 theory is related to the parameter @xmath18 by the t - duality relation@xcite @xmath80 let us generalize the analysis of tachyonic modes on ns5-branes given in @xcite to the case of @xmath81 .",
    "the metric of ns5-brane solution is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is compactified on @xmath0 as @xmath84 .",
    "because we assume that the compactification radius is very small , we can use a smeared solution . for coincident ns5-branes with the total charge @xmath85 ,",
    "the harmonic function @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 the free part of the action of the closed string tachyon field is @xmath88.\\ ] ] let us factorize the wave function of the tachyon field as @xmath89 the klein - gordon equation for the tachyon field on the ns5-brane solution ( [ ns5sol ] ) is @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the laplacian on @xmath39 with the metric @xmath93 .",
    "because of the twisted boundary condition , @xmath94 is quantized to be half odd integer .",
    "the schrdinger equation has the same form with that for an electron in a hydrogen atom and is solved as @xmath95\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -2+\\frac{4n|k_y|}{q}-\\frac{8n^2r^2}{q^2l_s^2}+{\\cal o}\\left(\\frac{r^4}{l_s^4}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath96 .",
    "the multiplicity of states is @xmath97 for each @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the case of single ns5-brane ( @xmath100 ) , the mass of the lightest states @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 thus , there are two localized tachyonic modes in the ns5-brane background ( [ ns5sol ] ) .",
    "the tachyonic mass approaches to zero as @xmath103 decreases and is of the same order with ( [ m2mso3 ] ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that on the type 0 side what is responsible for the instability of an ns5-brane is the localized modes of the closed string tachyon field .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed an instability of type 0 ns5-branes in two ways . by analyzing the kaluza - klein monopole like geometry , which is t - dual to a type 0 ns5-brane",
    ", we obtained a tachyonic mass of a decay mode proportional to inverse square of the compactification radius @xmath18 .",
    "this coincides up to a numerical coefficient with the result of the analysis of the closed string tachyon field on the ns5-brane classical solution .    in our analysis , to simplify the calculation",
    ", we used the metric determined by hand .",
    "although it was sufficient to show the existence of at least one tachyonic mode , we need more careful treatment of fluctuation modes to determine the number of tachyonic modes and the numerical proportional constant in ( [ m2mso3 ] ) , and to compare it to the tachyonic mass ( [ closedtachyonmass ] ) of the closed string modes on the ns5-brane background . for this purpose ,",
    "technique developed for instanton calculus@xcite may be useful .",
    "the geometry of @xmath37 is quite similar to a monopole - anti monopole geometry studied in @xcite and used for describing an instability of fluxbranes in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that four - dimensional euclidean schwarzschild black hole , which describes semi - classical instability of a kaluza - klein vacuum , is equivalent to a monopole - anti monopole pair in the kaluza - klein theory .",
    "this can be shown as follows .",
    "the isometry of four - dimensional euclidean schwarzschild black hole is @xmath9 , which is identical to that of @xmath37 .",
    "if we define @xmath0 fiber as orbits of the @xmath104 factor of the isometry , the base manifold is @xmath39 with a solid @xmath16 omitted .",
    "this is completely the same situation with @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use a diagonal @xmath104 of the @xmath104 factor of the isometry and a @xmath104 subgroup of the @xmath5 factor , we obtain @xmath0-bundle over @xmath39 with two nut singularities .",
    "the nut charges for two singularities have opposite signs .",
    "therefore , we can regard the geometry as a monopole - anti monopole pair . when we show that the charges have opposite signs",
    ", it is crucial that the black hole geometry has vanishing first chern class when it is represented as an @xmath105-bundle over @xmath16 . for @xmath37",
    ", it is not the case . in order to represent @xmath37 as a system of kaluza - klein monopoles",
    ", we use a @xmath104 subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "there are two fixed points under the @xmath104 and we obtain @xmath0 fibration over @xmath39 with two nut singularities again .",
    "however , at this time , the nut charges of two singularities are both @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the geometry is identified with a system of two monopoles .",
    "the expansion of the bubble may be understood as a repulsion of these two monopoles .",
