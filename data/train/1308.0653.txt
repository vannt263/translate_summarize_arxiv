    "the rapid and violent form of combustion called detonation @xcite propagates through detonation wave which is a shock wave with chemical reaction . given a wide range of application in science and engineering , shock and detonation have always been of great concern in the field of science and technology , such as the research and analysis on coal and gas outburst mechanism @xcite .",
    "the detonation phenomena are widely used in the acceleration of various projectiles , mining technologies , depositing of coating to a surface or cleaning of equipment , etc . early in 1899 and 1905 , chapmann @xcite and jouguet @xcite presented cj theory .",
    "this theory assumes that detonation front is a strong discontinuous plane with chemical reaction which immediately completes as soon as the detonation wave passes . in 1940s ,",
    "zeldovich @xcite , neumann @xcite and doering @xcite presented the well - known znd model .",
    "this model gives an important conclusion that there is von - neumann - peak at detonation wave front .",
    "reactant is firstly pre - compressed by shock wave , and there is a continuous reaction zone behind the shock wave .",
    "physical quantities ( density , temperature , pressure and velocity ) reach maximum values within the reaction zone .",
    "although detonation has been studied for more than one century @xcite , it remains an active area of research in both theoretical studies and numerical simulations @xcite due to its practical importance @xcite .",
    "so far , all chemical reaction models are empirical or semi - empirical formulas @xcite , such as the arrhenius kinetics , forest fire burn , two - step model , cochran s rate function @xcite , lee - tarver model @xcite , etc . selecting appropriate chemical reaction kinetics is very important for describing detonation phenomena under consideration . in this paper , we adopt cochran s rate function for chemical reaction , which is one of the most physically justifiable models satisfying simulation and experimental results @xcite .    in recent decades lattice boltzmann",

    "lb modeling for combustion phenomena has been an interesting topic from early days . in 1997 , succi et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the pioneering lb model for combustion systems under the assumptions of fast chemistry and cold flames with weak heat release . in 1998 and 2000 ,",
    "filippova and hnel @xcite proposed a kind of hybrid scheme for low mach number reactive flows .",
    "the flow field is solved by modified lattice - bgk model and the transport equations for energy and species are solved by a finite difference scheme . in 2002 , yu et al .",
    "@xcite simulated scalar mixing in a multi - component flow and a chemical reacting flow using the lb method . in the same year",
    ", yamamoto et al @xcite presented a lb model for simulation of combustion , which includes reaction , diffusion and convection . in 2006 , lee et al . presented a new two - distribution lb equation algorithm to solve the laminar diffusion flames within the context of burke - schumann flame sheet model . in 2007 , chen et al @xcite developed a novel coupled lattice boltzmann model for two- and three - dimensional low mach number combustion simulations . in this model ,",
    "the fluid density can bear sharp changes . in the following year",
    ", another lb model was proposed for simulating combustion in two - dimensional system by chen and and his cooperators @xcite . within this model",
    "the time step and the fluid particle speed can be adjusted dynamically . later , based on their improved models , they presented a number of works @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies on lb model were mainly focused on isothermal and incompressible fluid systems .",
    "those models generally can not recover the correct energy equation or describe enough the compressibility in the hydrodynamic limit , which makes difficult the modeling of systems with shock and/or detonation .",
    "at the same time , most of those lb models assume that exothermic reaction has no significant effect on fluid field , which also constrains the practical application of the models to most cases of combustion . in recent years , the development of lb models for high speed compressible flows @xcite makes it possible to simulate systems with shock and detonation . very recently",
    "yan , xu , zhang , et al .",
    "proposed a lattice boltzmann kinetic model ( lbkm ) for detonation phenomena in cartesian coordinates @xcite . for simulating the explosion and implosion behaviors , a polar coordinate lb model is obviously more convenient .",
    "and there are many nice papers about lb formulations for axisymmetric flows in polar coordinates @xcite . in 2011",
    "watari @xcite proposed a finite - difference lb methods in polar coordinate system .",
    "recently we @xcite improved the lbkm by using a hybrid scheme so that it works also for supersonic flows . within the improved model , the temporal evolution",
    "is calculated analytically and the convection term is solved via a modified warming - beam ( mwb ) scheme . in this work ,",
    "a new polar coordinate lbkm which is similar to and simpler than the one in ref.@xcite is used to study detonation phenomena .",
    "in contrast to traditional methods based on navier - stokes description , the lbkm has some intrinsic superiority in describing kinetic mechanisms in systems where equilibrium and non - equilibrium behaviors coexist @xcite . the mini - review @xcite presented a methodology to investigate non - equilibrium behaviors of the system by using the lb method . the non - equilibrium behaviors in various complex systems attract great attention @xcite . in the work @xcite by yan , xu , zhang , et al . , some non - equilibrium behaviors around the von neumann peak are obtained . in a recent work @xcite we studied the non - equilibrium characteristics of the system around three kinds of interfaces , the shock wave , the rarefaction wave and the material interface , for two specific cases .",
    "we draw qualitative information on the actual distribution function . in this work",

    "the amplitude of @xmath190 at the inner outgoing wave reduces , and the one at the explosion wave increases .    , physical quantities versus radius in explosion process at times , @xmath208 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 , respectively : ( a ) @xmath8 ; ( b ) @xmath26 ; ( c ) @xmath117 ; ( d ) @xmath189 ; ( e ) @xmath13 ; ( f ) @xmath190 . ,",
    "scaledwidth=99.0% ]    figure [ fig09 ] shows a direct explosion phenomenon with ignition energy large enough .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that the density behind the detonation front is lower than the one outside due to the disc geometric effect .",
    "panels ( b)-(c ) shows higher temperature and pressure inside .",
    "panel ( d ) shows that the velocity inside is close to zero .",
    "panel ( e ) shows that chemical reaction steadily proceeds .",
    "panel ( f ) shows that the amplitude of @xmath190 increases gradually .",
    "the detonation wave becomes wider and wider in both radical and azimuthal directions .",
    "in fact , there is competition between the chemical reaction , macroscopic transportation , thermal diffusion and the geometric convergence or divergence in the detonation phenomenon .",
    "the chemical reaction increases the temperature while the thermal diffusion decreases the temperature around the detonation wave . if there is enough thermal energy transformed from chemical energy , the detonation proceeds ; otherwise , extinguishes . specially in explosion case ,",
    "if the geometric divergence effects dominate , extinction will occur ; with the the combustion front propagating outwards , geometric divergence makes less effect , the existing part combustion may result in complete combustion , even detonation .",
    "a polar coordinate lattice boltzmann kinetic model ( lbkm ) for detonation phenomena is presented . within this novel model",
    ", the change of discrete distribution function due to local chemical reaction is given directly in the modified lattice boltzmann equation , which could recovery the navier - skokes equations including chemical reaction via chapman - enskog expansion . and",
    "the chemical reaction is described by cochran s rate function .",
    "a combined scheme is used to treat with the lb equation and the cochran s rate equation .",
    "both the temporal evolution of the collision effects in the lb equation and the temporal evolution of chemical reaction in cochran s rate equation are calculated analytically .",
    "both the convection terms in the lb equation and cochran s rate equation are treated using the first - order upwind scheme . from the numerical point of view , compared with the lbkm in ref .",
    "@xcite , the present model has the same accuracy but is simpler . from the physical or chemical point of view , compared with the lee - tarver model used in previous work @xcite , the pressure effects on the reaction rate is taken into account in the cochran s rate function .    compared with the previous work in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inner boundary condition for the disc computational domain is treated more naturally . in ref .",
    "@xcite the disc computational domain is approximated by a annular domain where the inner radius approaches zero .",
    "consequently , one needs to construct ghost nodes for the inner boundary condition . in this work",
    "the center of the disc computational domain is considered as a inner point of the system . for periodic system",
    ", no ghost node is needed for the inner boundary condition .",
    "other boundaries are treated with the same method as @xcite .",
    "the simulation results of physical quantities in the steady detonation process have a satisfying agreement with analytical solutions . typical implosion and explosion phenomena are simulated . by changing initial ignition energy ,",
    "we investigate three cases of explosion , including a case with extinction phenomenon .",
    "it is interesting to find that the geometric convergence or divergence effect makes the detonation procedure much more complex .",
    "the competition between the chemical reaction , the macroscopic transportation , the thermal diffusion and the geometric convergence or divergence determines the ignition process .",
    "if there is enough thermal energy transformed from chemical energy , the detonation proceeds ; otherwise , extinguishes . specially in explosion case , if the geometric divergence effects dominate , extinction will occur ; with the combustion front propagating outwards , geometric divergence makes less effect , the existing part combustion may result in complete combustion , even detonation .",
    "moreover , the non - equilibrium behaviors in detonation phenomenon are investigated via the velocity moments of discrete distribution functions .",
    "the system at the disc center is always in its thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the internal kinetic energies in different degrees of freedom around the detonation front do not coincide due to the fluid viscosity .",
    "they show the maximum difference at the inflexion point where the pressure has the largest spatial derivative .",
    "the influence of shock strength on the reaction rate and the influences of both the shock strength and the reaction rate on the departure amplitude of the system from its local thermodynamic equilibrium are probed . the departure from equilibrium in front of von - neumann peak results from shock effect , while the one behind the peak results from rarefaction effect .",
    "the departure increases when the shock or rarefaction effect increases .",
    "specially , the value of @xmath190 is positive at shock wave and negative at the rarefaction wave , which can be seen a criterion to distinguish the two waves .",
    "what s more , the main behaviors of actual distribution functions around the detonation wave are recovered from the numerical results of high - order moments of the discrete distribution function .",
    "finally , further discussions include the following points .",
    "( i ) for the combustion systems where both the reactant and product have more than one components , a multi - distribution - function model is more preferred .",
    "such a work is in progress @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the transport properties are relevant to the relaxation time @xmath4 .",
    "it should depend on physical quantities , such as density and temperature .",
    "consequently , it should be a function of the space and time .",
    "this point should be further investigated in the future .",
    "( iii ) in numerical simulations the spatial and temporal steps should be small enough so that the spurious transportation is negligible compared with the physical one .",
