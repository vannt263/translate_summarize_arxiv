    "scientific research on gravitational wave is one of the most important subjects in physics . detecting gravitational wave",
    "directly is essential to verify general relativity in strong gravitational fields and explore high - energy particle physics phenomena in the early universe . in other words ,",
    "physics of gravitational wave is attractive for both astrophysics and particle physics . due to a weakness of its interaction , the relic gravitational wave generated in the early universe",
    "brings us information on the early universe for what it was .",
    "we observe it as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds .",
    "quite recently it was reported that the relic gravitational wave originated in primordial inflation was discovered indirectly through the b - mode polarization experiment of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "therefore direct detections of the relic gravitational waves will take on increasing importance in the future .    in this paper ,",
    "we discuss possible direct detections of the relic gravitational wave background produced by the first - order electroweak phase transition occurred in the early universe at around @xmath4  gev .",
    "as is well known , within the standard model the effective potential of the higgs field can not induce the first - order phase transition unless the higgs mass is much lighter than the observed one  @xcite . in that case no gravitational wave is emitted because no latent heat is released during the transition . on the other hand however , strong first - order phase transitions are also predicted in a variety of theories beyond the standard model , such as supersymmetric extended models ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) and theories which induce a dimensional transmutation by introducing a new scalar field  @xcite in order to explain the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "after the higgs boson was discovered  @xcite , we should approach various problems related the higgs sector in detail .",
    "therefore , particle physicists in the world tend to get momentum to tackle the physics at the electroweak phase transition head - on .",
    "investigations of the higgs sector by using gravitational wave experiments are indeed exciting since we can explore particle physics through observations at cosmological scales .",
    "this kind of the verification for the higgs sector is complementary to experiments that directly explore the theories beyond the standard model like the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments and can be even much more powerful in some ways .",
    "since various experiments are planned to try to observe the gravitational waves , they cover a wide range of frequencies @xmath5  hz @xmath6  hz . in principle future experiments such as elisa  @xcite and decigo / bbo  @xcite have been known to detect the relic gravitational waves produced by the electroweak phase transition in future for the frequencies @xmath7  hz @xmath8  hz . in this paper",
    ", we further discuss possibilities to observe the relic gravitational waves through the pulsar timing experiments at square kilometre array ( ska ) under construction for the frequencies @xmath5  hz @xmath9  hz  @xcite .",
    "the phase 1 and the phase 2 of ska will starts from 2018 and 2023 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "in addition , so far effects by a large vacuum energy at a false vacuum on the phase transition has not been well examined . in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of the finite vacuum energy at the false vacuum in terms of cosmology .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we show model independent analyses of gravitational wave produced by the first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "section 3 is devoted to study the effect of the vacuum energy at the false vacuum . in section 4",
    ", we show the experimental detectabilities of the relic gravitational wave background .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize our works .",
    "when the first - order phase transition occurs , the universe make a transition from a false vacuum state to a true vacuum state .",
    "there exists an effective potential barrier between the true and the false vacua .",
    "then , the transition occurs due to thermal fluctuations and a quantum tunneling effect . in other words ,",
    "the true vacuum bubbles are produced inside the false vacuum state .",
    "however , the bubble nucleation itself does not generate any gravitational waves because of its spherical symmetric nature .",
    "the spherical symmetry is broken when they collide through their expansion , generating stochastic gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "fine details of the colliding regions are not so important to calculate the gravitational wave production .",
    "however , the gravitational wave is rather dominated by the gross features of the evolving bubble , which depends on kinetic energies of uncollided bubble walls  @xcite .",
    "these facts mean that so - called `` the envelope approximation '' should be a good approximation for evaluating the amount of the produced gravitational wave signals  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bubble expansion causes a macroscopic motion of cosmic plasma . when the bubbles collide , turbulence occurs in the fluid , which can become a significant source of the gravitational wave background  @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we introduce analytical methods to study the gravitational waves produced by the first - order phase transition .",
    "we take two most important parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , characterizing the gravitational waves from the first - order phase transition .",
    "then we show that general model parameters sufficiently reduce to only those two parameters when we discuss signals of the relic gravitational wave background .",
    "we adopt definitions of parameters used in this section mainly by following the ones in ref .",
    "we discuss phenomena on the basis of the friedman - robertson - walker universe , in which @xmath12 represents scale factor of the universe .",
    "we assume that the phase transition occurs at a cosmic temperature @xmath13 which is the order of @xmath14  gev .",
    "the gravitational wave of the frequency @xmath15 has arrived to us to be the present frequency  @xmath16 .",
    "hereafter the subscript `` @xmath17 '' denotes a physical quantity at the phase transition .",
    "then , the frequency we currently observe is represented by @xmath18 where the subscript `` @xmath19 '' means a value at the present .",
    "here we used the adiabatic expansion of the universe ( i.e. , the entropy @xmath20 const ) .",

    "the frequency is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 for @xmath28 1 mev .",
    "therefore we expect the typical frequency for the gravitational wave produced at the electroweak phase transition to be at around @xmath29 mhz ",

    "we will show how we can calculate @xmath36 in terms of two fundamental parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , which is the summation of the two contributions from the bubble collision ( @xmath37 ) and the turbulence ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we introduce two important parameters @xmath39 and @xmath11 to discuss model - independent analyses . at a finite temperature , the bubble nucleation rate of the phase transition",
    "is represented by  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 has units of energy to the fourth power and is typically represented by @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath48 represents a bubble profile of the field @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath49 denotes a radius in the polar coordinates .",
    "then the bubble profile is obtained by solving the bounce equation , @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 since the bubble nucleation rate has an exponential dependence , a key is a behavior of @xmath53 . by taking the time derivative of the action",
    ", we define @xmath54 in a neighborhood of @xmath55 , we naturally expect a series expansion to be @xmath56 here we introduce a dimension - less parameter to express the time derivative of the action , @xmath57 where we used a property of the adiabatic expansion of the universe , @xmath58 .",
    "this @xmath11 is one of the most important parameters to characterize the shape of the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "it is sufficient to look at the relationship used to determine the typical value of this , being able to percolate properly even for the exponentially - expanding universe appeared in other works .",
    "however , we have checked that this difference does not change our conclusion . ] .",
    "@xmath59 using this condition , it is possible to estimate the value of @xmath11 for each model .",
    "another important parameter is a quantity that represents how much latent heat is released at the phase transition . in the symmetry phase ,",
    "we denote the false vacuum energy density and the thermal energy density to be @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "then , the parameter @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 here , the energy density of the false vacuum is represented by @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 being the field values at the true and false vacua , respectively .",
    "also , the energy density of radiation @xmath68 is given by @xmath69    using those two parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , a peak spectrum of the gravitational wave @xmath70 at a peak frequency @xmath71 is represented by  @xcite @xmath72 here the subscript `` coll '' and `` turb '' denote the values in cases of the bubble collision and the turbulence , respectively .",
    "in these expressions , the bubble velocity @xmath73 , the fluid velocity @xmath74 and the efficiency factor @xmath75 are expressed as a function of @xmath39 to be  @xcite @xmath76    in case of the bubble collision , the entire spectrum has been also calculated analytically .",
    "using an envelope approximation , the full spectrum of the gravitational wave from the bubble collision is given by  @xcite @xmath77 where the value of @xmath78 and @xmath79 lie in the range @xmath80 $ ] , and @xmath81 $ ] . in case of the strong first - order phase transition , by a numerical simulation using a large number of colliding bubbles ,",
    "the authors of @xcite obtained @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tailcoll ] ) it is easily found that @xmath84 at @xmath85 . there is a remark that the formulae given here are available only when @xmath11 is sufficiently large  @xcite .",
    "as will be shown later , the effects due to the tails parts of the spectrum given in eq.([eq : tailcoll ] ) on experimental detectabilities are quite small .",
    "hence , even if we do not adopt full expressions for the spectrum in the turbulent case , which has not been known analytically , our results should not change significantly only in the current purposes .",
    "therefore we may take @xmath86 for any @xmath16 s approximately as a full spectrum for the turbulent case .",
    "in the previous section , we adopted the parametrizations , in which we took a limit that the vacuum energy is completely negligible . however , here we carefully check possible effects on the productions of the relic gravitational wave background .",
    "first , we investigate how the percolation is influenced by the vacuum energy . here",
    "we consider typical cases in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as a specific example ( see appendix  [ app : susy ] for the details ) .",
    "if we ignore the vacuum energy , we have obtained @xmath87 in order to complete the percolation as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : percolation_novacuum ] .    .",
    "the horizontal axis is the cosmic temperature in gev .",

    "next we incorporate the effect of the vacuum energy in this setup . for a concrete calculation",
    ", we calculate @xmath89 by parameterizing the vacuum energy @xmath90 .",
    "as seen in the previous section , the bubble nucleation is determined by the value of the euclidean action .",
    "however , there is no effect from the vacuum energy on the nucleation because the constant term is renormalized in the definition of the nucleation rate .",
    "only the hubble parameter , @xmath91 with @xmath92 planck mass , should be changed by adding the vacuum energy to the total energy density @xmath93 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : percolation_vacuum ] .",
    "as seen in this figure , the effect is only a mild change on @xmath94 with a small difference by the order of @xmath95 .",
    "that is because the bubble nucleation has the exponential dependence on @xmath47 , which is the dominant contribution to possibly change @xmath96 .    ,",
    "but changing the vacuum energy . from right to left , we took @xmath97 @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . ]    .",
    "we have also calculated transition temperature in those two cases , i.e. , no vacuum energy @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . in those cases the corresponding transition temperatures are @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "therefore , although there seems to exist a small difference between @xmath96 and @xmath104 , it does not change our conclusions so much . ]",
    "in this section , we discuss detectabilities of the relic gravitational wave background produced at the electroweak phase transition by using two fundamental parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in case of the phase transition at the electroweak scale ,",
