    "from the observational evidence of a few strongly magnetized neutron stars , which are the sources of anomalous x - rays and soft gamma rays , also called magnetars @xcite , the study of crustal matter , in particular the outer crust of such compact stellar objects have gotten a new dimension .",
    "these exotic objects are also called anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) .",
    "the outer crust of a typical neutron star in general , is mainly composed of dense crystalline metallic iron . the density of such metallic crystalline matter is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the normal nuclear density ( @xmath2gm / cc ) .",
    "therefore , it is absolutely impossible to investigate the properties of such ultra - dense matter in material science laboratories , even at zero magnetic field .",
    "the observed surface magnetic field of the magnetars is @xmath3 g , which is again too high to achieve in the terrestrial laboratories .",
    "also , it is quite possible that the interior field of such exotic objects can go up to @xmath4 g ( which can be shown theoretically by virial theorem ) .",
    "if the magnetic field at the interior is really so high , then most of the physical and chemical properties of the dense neutron matter should change significantly from the conventional neutron star ( radio pulsars ) scenario ( see the recent article by one of the co - authors of this article @xcite for necessary references ) .",
    "even though the magnetic field strength at the crustal region is slightly higher than @xmath5 g , it must change significantly most of the properties of dense matter , both in the outer crust and the inner crust regions of the magnetars @xcite .",
    "it is believed that strong magnetic field can cause a structural deformation of the metallic atoms present in the outer crust of a neutron star .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the atoms will be destroyed and becomes cigar shape with the elongated axis along the direction of strong magnetic field .",
    "the atoms may even become almost an one dimensional string like object , i.e. , needle shape , if the magnetic field strength is extremely strong . in a future article we shall present the problem related to structural deformation of atoms in a strong quantizing magnetic field using a completely different approach @xcite .",
    "in this article we shall study the properties of outer crust matter composed of magnetically deformed metallic ( iron ) atoms . in section 2",
    "we have developed the basic formalism and discuss the numerical results , whereas in the last section we have given the conclusion and the future prospect of this work . in this article , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall assume a cylindrical deformation of the atoms in the outer crust region and use cylindrical coordinate system with azimuthal symmetry .",
    "in reality , to investigate the cigar like deformed atoms in presence of strong magnetic field one has to use prolate spheroidal coordinate system .",
    "the width of the outer crust of a typical neutron star is @xmath6 km , the density of matter , which is assumed to be a dense crystal of metallic iron is @xmath7gm / cc @xcite . to investigate the properties of such dense exotic crystalline matter of metallic iron , we have replaced the outer crust matter by a regular array of cylindrically deformed ( in our future work",
    "we shall consider more realistic geometrical structure of the deformed atoms , which is prolate spheroidal in nature ) wigner - seitz ( ws ) cells , with the positively charged nucleus at the centre surrounded by a non - uniform electron gas .",
    "the axis of each cylinder is along the direction of magnetic field and further assumed azimuthal symmetry for all the cylindrically deformed ws cells .",
    "we start with the poisson s equation , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electrostatic field , e is the electron charge and @xmath10 is the electron density , which because of assumed non - uniformity within the ws cell , is a function of positional coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "now in the cylindrical coordinate with circular symmetry , the above equation reduces to @xmath12 it is well known that in the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field , the number density of degenerate electron gas is given by @xmath13 where b is the constant external magnetic field , assumed to be acting along z - direction and is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the typical strength of magnetic field beyond which , in the relativistic region the landau levels for the electrons are populated . for the sake of convenience , throughout this article we shall use @xmath16 .",
    "the critical strength is given by @xmath17 @xcite and assume that the matter is at zero temperature , where @xmath18 is the electron rest mass and @xmath19 is the magnitude of electron charge . in eqn.(3 ) , @xmath20 is the electron fermi momentum , @xmath21 is the landau quantum number , with @xmath22 , the upper limit of @xmath21 .",
    "the factor @xmath23 takes care of singly degenerate @xmath24 state and doubly degenerate all other states with @xmath25 . to study the properties of outer crust matter with deformed ws cells",
    ", we make thomas - fermi approximation , which is a semi - classical approach and having a lot of shortcomings and limitations @xcite .",
    "we further use the thomas - fermi condition , given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the electron chemical potential and in this model , it is assumed to be constant throughout the ws cell . from this equation",
    "we can express the fermi momentum of electrons in the following form : @xmath28^{1/2}\\ ] ] since the electrostatic potential @xmath29 , the fermi momentum @xmath20 for electron is also a function of positional coordinates @xmath11 within the cell . in principle",
    "one should use the exact expression for electron fermi momentum as given above , in the equation for electron density ( eqn.(3 ) ) which is in turn appearing on the right hand side of the cylindrical form of poisson s equation ( eqn.(2 ) ) .",
    "however , with this exact expression for @xmath20 , it is absolutely impossible to proceed further analytically , even a single effective step . from the very beginning , therefore , one has to use some numerical technique to solve the poisson s equation , which is an extremely complicated nonlinear partial differential equation . of course",
    ", with the numerical method within the limitation of the algorithm followed , we will get more exact results .",
    "however , in numerical computation of @xmath30 , we get a set of numbers , but the beauty of this model will be completely destroyed and a lot of interesting physics associated with intermediate results of this problem will be totally lost . in this context , let us quote from a quite old but extremely interesting paper by wigner and bardeen @xcite- `` it is perhaps not quite superfluous to have , in addition to a more exact calculations of a physical quantity , an approximate treatment which merely shows how the quantity in question is determined , and the lines along which a more exact calculation could be carried out .",
    "such a treatment often leads to a simple formula by means of which the magnitude of the quantity may be readily determined '' .",
    "therefore , to get an approximate analytical solution for @xmath30 , we assume that @xmath31 and neglect the rest mass of electron , i.e. , we put @xmath32 in the expression for fermi momentum @xmath20 ( eqn.(5 ) ) .",
    "the approximation @xmath31 is actually valid if the magnetic field is extremely high .",
    "however , to investigate the properties of dense electron gas within the cylindrically deformed cells in a little bit of exact manner later in this article , we shall use the approximate solution for @xmath30 , but do not restrict ourselves to @xmath31 .",
    "in fact we shall show later that the upper limit @xmath22 for the electron landau quantum number is also a function of @xmath11 . therefore to evaluate various physical quantities in the outer crust region , we have to first obtain an approximate solution for the poisson s equation . to achieve our goal",
    ", we use the approximate form of electron fermi momentum obtained from the assumption as mentioned above and its mathematical form is given by @xmath33 next on substituting @xmath34 the cylindrical form of poisson s equation reduces to @xmath35 where @xmath36 . under this approximation , the poisson s equation , as shown above , reduces to a linear partial differential equation . to solve this partial differential equation",
    "analytically we use the method of separation of variables , given by @xmath37 substituting @xmath38 from eqn.(9 ) in eqn.(8 ) and introducing a constant @xmath39 , we get @xmath40 where @xmath39 is some real constant , independent of r and z but may change with the magnetic field strength and with the mass number and the atomic number of the type of elements present in the outer crust region",
    ". the solutions of eqns.(10 ) and ( 11 ) are well known . for eqn.(10 ) , the solution is a bessel function of order zero with the argument @xmath41 , whereas for eqn.(11 ) , it is an exponentially decaying function of @xmath42 . in the language of mathematics , the solution for @xmath38",
    "is then given by @xmath43\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 signs are for @xmath46 or @xmath47 respectively . here",
    "@xmath48 is a constant ( again may change with the magnetic field strength and with the atomic properties of the elements present in the outer crust ) and @xmath49 is the bessel function of order zero . now on the nuclear surface , at the centre of the ws cells , @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the atomic number and @xmath52 is the nuclear radius , @xmath53fm and @xmath54 is the mass number ( here we have assumed that the nuclei remain spherical , even if the magnetic field is too high ) . for the sake of simplicity we put @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the nuclear surface , i.e.",
    ", we have chosen points on nuclear surface along @xmath57-axis , which gives @xmath58 hence we get @xmath59\\ ] ] in the expression , of course , @xmath39 is still an unknown quantity . to determine @xmath39",
    ", we now put @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the expression for @xmath30 on the nuclear surface , i.e. , we have chosen a point on the positive side of @xmath62-axis .",
    "then using @xmath63 , we have ( because of the symmetry about @xmath55 plane , @xmath64 and @xmath61 will also give the same result ) @xmath65=\\mu_e+\\frac{z_0 e^2}{r_n}\\ ] ] hence we get @xmath66=j_0(\\xi r_n)\\ ] ] this is a highly transcendental equation for @xmath39 .",
    "however , it is possible to evaluate @xmath39 numerically from this equation for a given magnetic field strength and for a given type of element , say metallic iron in the crystalline form present in the outer crust region .",
    "the above expression puts some constraint on the range of @xmath67 . to make this point more transparent",
    "let us express eqn.(16 ) in the following form @xmath68 ^ 2\\ ] ] since @xmath69 is an oscillatory function and becomes negative as @xmath67 crosses the first zero , in the numerical computation we therefore put a check in the computer code to restrict @xmath67 from @xmath70 to the first zero@xmath45 , which is @xmath71 .",
    "in fig.(1 ) we have plotted @xmath39 ( in mev ) as a function of magnetic field strength @xmath72 , expressed in terms of critical magnetic field strength @xmath73 .",
    "the variation is insensitive for the low and moderate values of magnetic field strengths .",
    "however , the overall magnitude of @xmath39 is very close to @xmath74mev .",
    "this figure shows that beyond field strength @xmath75 g , @xmath39 increases sharply . in fig.(2 )",
    "we have plotted the variation of normalization constant @xmath48 with the magnetic field strength , expressed in the same unit as in fig.(1 ) . for low and moderate magnetic field values",
    "it is almost constant , then it falls abruptly beyond @xmath75 g and finally saturates to a constant value equal to @xmath76mev .",
    "since beyond @xmath75 g , electrons within the cells occupy their zeroth or very low lying landau levels , the quantum mechanical effect of magnetic field becomes extremely important and as a consequence both @xmath39 and @xmath48 change significantly beyond this magnetic field value .",
    "since the ws cells are overall charge neutral , then at any point @xmath11 on the surface , even on the plane faces or on the boundary points of @xmath55 plane , we have in cylindrical coordinate @xmath77 this condition gives @xmath78 which must be satisfied at all the surface points on the ws cylinder .",
    "now from the thomas - fermi condition , we have @xmath79^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 . with this more exact expression for @xmath20 ,",
    "the number density for electron gas can be expressed as @xmath81^{1/2}\\ ] ] this is obviously more exact than eqn.(3 ) .",
    "further , this expression shows that the electron density is a function of both @xmath57 and @xmath42 within the ws cell . which justifies the assumption that the electron distribution inside each ws cell around the fixed nucleus is non - uniform .",
    "now from the non - negative nature of @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 the upper limit of landau quantum number @xmath22 will therefore also depend on the positional coordinates of the associated electron within the cell . in fig.(3 ) we have plotted electron number density in terms of normal nuclear density multiplied by @xmath84 , as a function of radial distance from nuclear surface to the ws cell boundary for the magnetic field strengths @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath84 and @xmath88 times @xmath73 , indicated by the curves @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "these curves show that the electron number density is maximum near the nuclear surface and minimum near the ws cell boundary @xmath94 .",
    "this figure also shows that the value of electron number density increases with the strength of magnetic field . in fig.(4 )",
    "we have plotted the same quantity as in fig.(3 ) but against the axial distance @xmath42 from the nuclear surface to the ws boundary indicated by @xmath95 . in this case",
    "also the variations are exactly same as in fig.(3 ) .",
    "the qualitative difference is because of different types of functional dependence . in fig.(5 ) we have plotted the upper limit of landau quantum number @xmath22 as a function of radial coordinate from the nuclear surface to the ws cell boundary . in this figure",
    "the upper curve is for @xmath96 , the middle one is for @xmath97 and the lower one is for @xmath98 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 decreases with the increase in magnetic field strengths .",
    "it has been observed that beyond @xmath99 , @xmath22 becomes identically zero throughout the ws cell .",
    "further , the value of @xmath22 for @xmath100 is largest near the nuclear surface and exactly zero at the cell boundary . in fig.(6 ) we have plotted the same kind of variation of @xmath22 , but against the axial distance from nuclear surface to the cell boundary .",
    "the qualitative and the quantitative variations are exactly identical with fig.(5 ) .",
    "these two figures show that the electrons are completely spin polarized in the direction opposite to the magnetic field @xmath101 at the cell boundary for @xmath100 , but beyond this value they are polarized at all the points within the cell .",
    "although the variations along radial and axial directions are shown in these two figures , we expect that such polarized picture of electron gas will be there throughout the cylindrically deformed ws cell surface , including the two plane faces .",
    "now the minimum possible value of @xmath22 is zero , hence we have @xmath102 to get the length and radius of the cylindrically deformed ws cell , we first put @xmath61 in the above expression .",
    "then we have @xmath103\\geq m_e ^2\\ ] ] therefore beyond some value of @xmath42 , say @xmath95 , this inequality will break , i.e. , just at value @xmath104 , we have @xmath105=m_e ^2\\ ] ] since @xmath42-axis is symmetric about @xmath55 plane , we have from this relation @xmath106 this is the magnitude of @xmath42 on the plane faces of a ws cell , i.e. , @xmath107 is the length of the cylindrically deformed ws cell for a given b and a set of @xmath108 . in fig.(7 ) we have shown the variation of @xmath95 with the strength of magnetic field @xmath72 expressed as before in terms of critical field strength @xmath73 .",
    "this figure shows that the variation is almost insensitive for low and moderate magnetic field strengths but decreases almost abruptly beyond @xmath109 g , when most of the electrons occupy their zeroth landau level , and finally tends to saturate to a constant value @xmath110fm .    to get the radius of such cells",
    ", we next put @xmath55 , then we have @xmath111 which further gives for @xmath112 , the radius of the cylindrical ws cells , @xmath113 obviously an analytical solution for @xmath94 is absolutely impossible , we obtain numerically the value of @xmath94 for a given @xmath72 and @xmath114 . in this case also , as before , we restrict the value of the product @xmath115 the first zero of @xmath116 .",
    "the variation of @xmath94 with the strength of magnetic field is shown in fig.(8 ) .",
    "the nature of variation is more or less same as that of @xmath95 .",
    "however , we have noticed that for extremely large field strength , @xmath117 . this is a remarkable difference from its longitudinal counter part .",
    "it actually shows that in presence of extremely strong magnetic field the cylinders become more and more thin in the transverse direction .",
    "we therefore conclude that with the increase in magnetic field strength the radial contraction will be enormous compared to the axial one . from figs.(7)-(8 )",
    "we have noticed that the variations are most significant beyond @xmath118 g .",
    "the reason is again because of the fact that the electrons occupy only their zeroth landau level in presence of such strong magnetic field , at which the quantum mechanical effect of the magnetic field dominates .",
    "next we calculate the different kinds of energies of electron gas within the ws cells .",
    "the cell averaged kinetic energy density of an electron is given by @xmath119\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the cylindrical coordinate system with azimuthal symmetry @xmath120 , with the limits @xmath121 and @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the volume of each cell .",
    "the @xmath124 integral is trivial and can be obtained an analytic expression for the average kinetic energy density .",
    "however , if we do not integrate over @xmath57 and @xmath42 , then from this equation we get the energy density @xmath125 at a particular point inside the cell .",
    "of course , in that case we need not have to divide by @xmath126 .",
    "the factor @xmath127 is for @xmath42-symmetry about @xmath55 plane . in fig.(9 ) we have plotted the variation of kinetic energy density as a function of radial distance @xmath57 from the nuclear surface to the cell boundary , keeping @xmath55 .",
    "this figure shows that the kinetic energy density increases with the increase in magnetic field strength .",
    "we have indicated the curves by @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the magnetic field strengths @xmath128 ,",
    "@xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively . in fig.(10 ) we have shown the same kind of variation along axial distance from the nuclear surface to one of the plane faces of the ws cell .",
    "the variation with magnetic field strength is again almost identical with fig.(9 ) .",
    "similar to the variation of electron number density within the cell ( fig.(3 ) and fig.(4 ) ) , both fig.(9 ) and fig.(10 ) show that the kinetic energy density for electrons is maximum near the nuclear surface and minimum at the cell boundary .",
    "similarly , the cell averaged electron - nucleus interaction energy per unit volume is given by @xmath133 analogous to the kinetic energy , here also one can obtain the interaction energy per unit volume , @xmath134 at a particular point within the cell . in fig.(11 ) , the variation of the magnitude of electron - nucleus interaction energy per unit volume with the radial distance is plotted . in this figure",
    "we have indicated the curves by @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the magnetic field strengths @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively .",
    "this figure shows that the magnitude of electron - nucleus interaction energy increases with the increase in magnetic field strength . which means that with the increase in magnetic field strength the electrons become more strongly bound by the nuclear coulomb attractive potential .",
    "it is also obvious from the figs.(9)-(12 ) that for a given magnetic field strength the kinetic energy density and the magnitude of electron - nucleus interaction energy per unit volume at a particular point , either along axial direction or in the radial direction , inside the ws cell are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we do believe that this is true at all the points inside the ws cell . in fig.(12 ) we have shown the same kind of variation along z - axis .",
    "both the qualitative and the quantitative nature of variations with the strength of magnetic field are same as that of fig.(11 ) .",
    "next we consider the cell averaged electron - electron direct interaction energy density , given by @xmath135^{1/2}}\\ ] ] now assuming @xmath136 as the reference axis , we have @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the angle between @xmath136 and @xmath139",
    ". then @xmath140 , with @xmath141 . in this case",
    "the @xmath42 integral has to be broken into two parts , one with limit @xmath142 and the other one with the limit @xmath143 .",
    "the value of @xmath144 is not easy to evaluate in the region between @xmath62-axis and @xmath57-axis . with @xmath138 symmetry ,",
    "for the sake of simplicity we put @xmath145 and expect that the error will be nominal . now to obtain electron - electron direct interaction energy one has to evaluate the five dimensional integral as shown in eqn.(29 ) .",
    "none of them can be obtained analytically , hence it is necessary to follow some numerical method .",
    "even the @xmath138 integral can not be obtained analytically .",
    "one can express the @xmath138 integral in the form of an elliptical integral of first kind , given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 $ ] .",
    "the direct part is then given by @xmath148^{1/2 } } i_{\\cal{el}}(r , r^\\prime , z , z^\\prime)\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath149 is coming from the angular integral over @xmath138 from @xmath150 to @xmath151 .",
    "let us now consider the elliptic integral ( eqn.(30 ) ) on @xmath55-plane . in this case both @xmath42 and @xmath152 are zero and the factor @xmath153 .",
    "then it can be shown very easily that the integral given by eqn.(30 ) will diverge at the lower limit . to avoid this unphysical infinity we put a lower cut off ( infrared cut off ) @xmath154 , which will now the lower limit for @xmath138 .",
    "the physical meaning of non - zero lower limit for the @xmath138-integral is that the two electrons under consideration can not be at zero distance from each other on the arc of a circle whose centre is same as that of the nucleus .",
    "the infrared cut off @xmath154 which is a measure of angular distance between two neighboring electrons must necessarily depends on the minimum possible linear distance between them and also on the radial distance from the centre . from a very elementary geometrical construction",
    "it can be shown that @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the arc length , or the distance between two neighboring electrons on the circular arc .",
    "since @xmath156 is infinitesimal in nature , we can approximate it by a straight line of length @xmath156 , which is the length of the cord connecting two points occupied by two neighboring electrons . since @xmath156 is the minimum possible distance between two electrons",

    "these two figures show that the kinetic pressure is maximum near the nuclear surface and zero at the cell boundary .",
