    "spintronic materials and devices are in the focus of current research activities @xcite .",
    "regarding functional spintronic materials , transition metal oxides are promising candidates , since they show a rich variety of electrical and magnetic properties specifically interesting for applications in spintronics .",
    "evidently , useful spintronic devices such as magnetoresistive elements based on the tunneling magnetoresistance @xcite or spin transistors @xcite require ferromagnetic materials with high curie temperature @xmath12 well above room temperature and large spin polarization @xmath13 of the charge carriers at the fermi level @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , advanced applications often require materials with magnetic properties which can be deliberately tuned by external control parameters such as an applied electric field @xcite , elastic stress @xcite , or light @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "fe@xmath15o@xmath2 ( magnetite ) is a highly promising candidate .",
    "first , it has both a high curie temperature of @xmath16k and according to band structure calculations is expected a half - metal @xcite corroborated by spin - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "second , recent experiments indicated that both the electronic and magnetic properties of fe@xmath15o@xmath2 thin films can be nicely tailored in solid solution systems of fe@xmath17o@xmath2 ( @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "third , it has been demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy of fe@xmath15o@xmath2 can be tuned by elastic stress imposed by a piezoelectric actuator@xcite .",
    "taken all together , due to their interesting , versatile , and tunable properties magnetite thin films and heterostructures became the focus of recent research activities .    before discussing the various possibilities for tuning and tailoring the electronic and magnetic properties of magnetite we briefly review its basic structural and magnetic properties .",
    "magnetite is known to have an inverse spinel structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinel](a ) . the @xmath7 sites ( 8 per unit cell ) , which are surrounded by oxygen tetrahedra ,",
    "are occupied by trivalent fe@xmath9 ions ( @xmath19 ) , whereas on the octahedrally coordinated @xmath8 sites ( 16 per unit cell ) there is an alternating arrangement of fe@xmath10 ( @xmath20 ) and fe@xmath11 ( @xmath19 ) ions .",
    "therefore , the sum formula of magnetite can be expressed as [ fe@xmath21@xmath22[fe@xmath23fe@xmath24@xmath25o@xmath2 .",
    "the density of itinerant charge carriers is determined by the density of the @xmath26 spin - down electron on the @xmath8 site , i.e. by the density of fe@xmath10 .",
    "the magnetic exchange in magnetite is governed by a combination of antiferromagnetic superexchange ( se ) and ferromagnetic double exchange ( de ) interactions .",
    "there are three antiferromagnetic se interactions @xmath27 ( @xmath7-o-@xmath7 ) , @xmath28 ( @xmath8-o-@xmath8 ) , and @xmath29 ( @xmath7-o-@xmath8 ) between the fe@xmath23 ions on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 sites mediated by the oxygen ( o ) ions .",
    "in addition , there is a ferromagnetic de interaction mediated by the itinerant spin - down @xmath26 electrons hopping between the mixed - valent fe ions on the @xmath8 sites ( cf .",
    "[ fig : spinel ] ) .",
    "owing to hund s rule coupling , the spins of these itinerant electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to the localized spins formed by the @xmath30 spin - up electrons . as pointed out by nel @xcite , in the simplest model ferrimagnetism in fe@xmath15o@xmath2 with high @xmath12",
    "is obtained without any de interaction for large @xmath31 forcing an antiparallel alignment of the moments on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spinel](b ) ) . since the antiparallel fe@xmath9 and fe@xmath11 moments compensate each other , a saturation magnetization of @xmath32/formula unit ( f.u . )",
    "is expected from the remaining fe@xmath10 ( @xmath33 ) moments .",
    "later on , the simple nel model has been extended by yafet and kittel @xcite .",
    "they proposed a more elaborate model in which the @xmath8 sublattice is subdivided into two fe@xmath10 and fe@xmath11 sublattices .",
    "it was shown that on weakening @xmath29 and strengthening @xmath28 , the @xmath8 site magnetic moments are no longer rigidly parallel to the @xmath7 site moments .",
    "the stronger @xmath8-o-@xmath8 se interaction results in spin canting expressed by a finite yafet - kittel angle and thus a reduction of the saturation magnetization .",
    "more recent models show that a detailed modelling of the magnetic properties of magnetite is only possible by taking into account the ferromagnetic de interaction of the @xmath8 sublattice competing with the antiferromagnetic se @xcite .     on the tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath7 site and mixed - valent fe@xmath10 ( @xmath34 , s=2)/fe@xmath11 ( @xmath35 ) ions on the octahedrally coordinated @xmath8 site .",
    "zn substitution replaces fe@xmath9 on the @xmath7 site by nonmagnetic zn@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ions .",
    "also shown is the occupation of the fe@xmath10 and fe@xmath11 @xmath30 states with @xmath26 and @xmath38 symmetry separated by the crystal field splitting due to the octahedral oxygen surrounding .",
    "the @xmath26 spin - down electron can hop between fe@xmath10 and fe@xmath11 ions with its spin coupled anti - parallel to the local moment formed by the spin - up electrons owing to hund s rule coupling .",
    "( b ) - ( e ) shows the @xmath7 and @xmath8 sublattice configuration for zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 for ( b ) @xmath39 , ( c ) @xmath40 , ( d ) @xmath41 , and ( e ) @xmath42 . ]",
    "there are several possibilities to tailor the magnetic properties of magnetite .",
    "first , fe@xmath9 on the @xmath7 site can be replaced by an isovalent nonmagnetic ion . in this way",
    "antiferromagnetically coupled moments on the @xmath7 sites are removed without affecting the magnetic exchange on the @xmath8 sublattices .",
    "hence , an increase of the saturation magnetization is expected at low substitution level . however , on increasing the @xmath7 site substitution the dilution of the @xmath7 site moments reduces @xmath29 , whereas @xmath28 stays about constant . then the moments on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 site do no longer need to be rigidly antiparallel , resulting in a finite yafet - kittel angle ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spinel](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this angle increases with increasing substitution , resulting in a reduction of the saturation magnetization . due to the isovalent substitution",
    "the charge carrier density should stay unaffected .",
    "however , the hopping between the mixed - valent ( fe@xmath10/fe@xmath11 ) ions on the @xmath8 sublattice is reduced due to the spin canting , resulting in a lower electrical conductivity and reduced de interaction . to our knowledge",
    "a nonmagnetic isovalent @xmath7 site substitution in fe@xmath15o@xmath2 has not been reported so far .",
    "most likely this can be attributed to the fact that suitable trivalent ions usually prefer the octahedral coordination on the @xmath8 site and thus can not be substituted solely on the tetrahedral @xmath7 site .",
    "second , as done in our work , fe@xmath9 on the @xmath7 site can be replaced by a nonmagnetic divalent ion such as zn@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that zn@xmath36 preferably occupies the tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath7 site in the inverse spinel structure @xcite .",
    "again some of the antiferromagnetically coupled moments on the @xmath7 sites are removed , leading to an initial increase of the saturation magnetization at low zn substitution @xcite .",
    "however , in the same way as discussed before , a finite yafet - kittel angle and , in turn , a reduction of the saturation magnetization is expected going to larger substitution levels @xcite . moreover ,",
    "substitution of fe@xmath9 by zn@xmath36 on the @xmath7 site also reduces the amount of fe@xmath10 on the @xmath8 site due to charge neutrality .",
    "that is , the amount of itinerant charge carriers mediating the de on the @xmath8 sublattice is reduced as shown by photoemission spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "thus , with increasing zn substitution the electrical conductivity is reduced both by a reduction of the density of itinerant charge carriers and their hopping amplitude due to spin canting .",
    "third , fe vacancies can be introduced by preparing magnetite samples in excess oxygen @xcite .",
    "since fe vacancies are formally equivalent to the presence of excess of o@xmath43 ions , charge neutrality again requires a reduced ( increased ) amount of fe@xmath10 ( fe@xmath11 ) ions on the @xmath8 site .",
    "this strengthens antiferromagnetic se and weakens ferromagnetic de on the @xmath8 sublattice . in turn , this results in a finite yafet - kittel angle and a reduced saturation magnetization .",
    "furthermore , a reduced electrical conductivity is expected both by a reduced carrier density and hopping amplitude .",
    "our brief discussion shows that fe based magnetic oxides with spinel structure are interesting materials .",
    "they do not only have high curie temperature and high spin polarization but also offer various opportunities to tailor their electrical ( charge carrier density , electrical conductivity ) and magnetic properties ( saturation magnetization , curie temperature ) .",
    "such tunable ferromagnetic materials are desired for spintronic devices operating at room temperature .",
    "for example , tuning the electrical conductivity of ferromagnetic materials with high spin polarization is promising for spin injection devices as one can reduce and deliberately choose the conductivity mismatch between semiconductors and ferromagnetic spin injectors . to this end",
    ", recently the growth of epitaxial fe@xmath15o@xmath2/zno heterostructures has been demonstrated @xcite . here",
    ", we report on the growth as well as the structural , magnetic and magnetotransport properties of epitaxial thin film samples of zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath44 deposited in different oxygen partial pressure .",
    "we show that their saturation magnetization and electrical conductivity can be tuned over a wide range both by zn substitution and varying oxygen partial pressure during growth .",
    "furthermore , our systematic study provides clear evidence that their electrical conductivity is closely related to the overall magnetization .",
    "we also carefully consider the presence of anti - phase boundaries ( apbs ) in the thin film samples which could affect both their electrical conductivity and their saturation magnetization @xcite .",
    "however , we have clear evidence that apbs do not play a dominant role in this study . in particular , they can not explain the change of the magnetic and magnetotransport properties on varying the zn content and the deposition atmosphere .",
    "in contrast , these properties can be consistently explained solely by disorder and spin canting on the @xmath8 sublattice , tending to localize the itinerant charge carriers on the @xmath8 sublattice .",
    "epitaxial thin films of zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath45 and thicknesses between 40 nm and 60 nm were deposited from stoichiometric targets on single crystalline , ( 001 ) oriented mgo substrates by laser molecular beam epitaxy ( laser - mbe)@xcite .",
    "the exact film thickness was determined by x - ray reflectometry .",
    "both bulk fe@xmath15o@xmath2 having an inverse spinel structure ( @xmath46 ) and mgo ( @xmath47 ) are cubic with lattice constants of @xmath48 @xcite and @xmath49 , respectively , resulting in a small lattice mismatch of @xmath50 .",
    "the energy density of the krf excimer laser ( @xmath51 nm ) at the target was 3.1j/@xmath52 and the laser repetition rate 2hz .",
    "at the same total pressure of @xmath53 mbar , two sets of samples were deposited in two different growth atmospheres . in pure ar ,",
    "thin films with @xmath39 , 0.1 , 0.5 , and 0.9 were grown at a substrate temperature of @xmath54c . in an ar",
    "/ o@xmath4 ( 99:1 ) mixture , thin films with @xmath41 were deposited at @xmath54c and with @xmath39 , 0.33 , and 0.9 at @xmath55c .",
    "the growth process was monitored _ in - situ _ by reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed)@xcite .",
    "we observed four rheed intensity oscillations per unit cell , indicating a block - by - block growth mode with four charge neutral blocks .",
    "this is already known for fe@xmath15o@xmath2@xcite and also holds when substituting zn up to zn@xmath56fe@xmath57o@xmath2 . a more detailed description of the thin film deposition for fe@xmath15o@xmath2 on mgo is given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the structural properties of the zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 films were analyzed by high resolution x - ray diffractometry using a bruker axs d8 discover four - circle diffractometer .",
    "our detailed analysis reveals a very high epitaxial quality of all thin film samples . in @xmath58",
    "$ ] direction , @xmath59-@xmath60 scans display no impurity phases - in particular from other iron or zinc oxides .",
    "we note that we may not be able to distinguish between fe@xmath15o@xmath2 and @xmath61-fe@xmath4o@xmath15 ( maghemite ) as they both share the same inverse spinel lattice@xcite .",
    "it is known that excess oxygen results in the formation of fe vacancies and in the extreme case to formation of fe@xmath15o@xmath2/@xmath61-fe@xmath4o@xmath15 solid solutions @xcite .",
    "the fe@xmath15o@xmath2/@xmath61-fe@xmath4o@xmath15 thermodynamic equilibrium line was determined to @xmath62 with @xmath63bar @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , both calculations and experimental studies of phase and point defect equilibria always apply to thermal equilibrium situations which certainly are not appropriate for the laser - mbe growth process occuring far from equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , the high energy of the particles in the laser plume can be associated to an effective growth temperature much larger than the substrate temperature favoring the stability of fe@xmath15o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the deposition temperature and oxygen partial pressure used in our experiments we are sufficiently far away from the fe@xmath15o@xmath2/@xmath61-fe@xmath4o@xmath15 equilibrium line @xcite .",

    "this demonstrates the excellent structural quality of the zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 thin film samples with very low mosaic spread , comparable to epitaxial fe@xmath15o@xmath2 films @xcite . in the @xmath59-@xmath60 scan ,",

    "the absolute value and variation of the @xmath65 axis lattice parameter of the zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 films with zn content @xmath64 are related to two effects , namely epitaxial coherency strain and the larger ionic radius of tetrahedrally coordinated zn@xmath36 of 0.6   compared to the radius of only 0.49   of fe@xmath23 on the tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath7 site @xcite .",
    "first , for @xmath39 the lattice mismatch of @xmath73 between fe@xmath15o@xmath2 film and mgo substrate leads to a tensile in - plane epitaxial coherency strain and , in turn , to a slight reduction of the @xmath65 axis lattice parameter of the fe@xmath15o@xmath2 film below the bulk value ( cf .",
    "[ fig : rsm](a ) ) .",
    "the fully coherent growth of the zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 thin films is demonstrated by reciprocal space maps around the ( 204 ) reflection of the mgo substrate ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : rsm ] is the fact that the @xmath65 axis lattice parameters of the zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 films grown in pure ar atmosphere are larger than those of the films grown in an ar / o@xmath4 mixture and also show a slightly weaker increase with zn content in the range @xmath76 .",
    "this most likely is caused by the formation of fe vacancies when growing the films in finite oxygen partial pressure @xcite .",
    "the presence of fe vacancies can be viewed as an internal negative pressure effect leading to a reduced cell volume .",
    "the weaker increase of the @xmath65 axis parameter for the films grown in ar / o@xmath4 suggests a partial compensation of the fe vacancies by zn substitution .",
    "this is in agreement with the transport data discussed below .",
    "we note , however , that this result has to be considered with some care .",
    "the problem is that the close vicinity of film and substrate reflections in the @xmath77-@xmath60 scans does not allow an unambiguous derivation of the film @xmath65 axis parameter with small error bars .    in summary",
    ", the structural analysis demonstrates that our zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2(001 ) thin films are coherently strained and show a very small mosaic spread .",
    "zn substitution results in an increase of the unit cell volume , causing the in - plane epitaxial strain to change from tensile to compressive on increasing the zn content @xmath64 . growth in excess oxygen results in a reduction of the unit cell volume most likely due to the formation of fe vacancies .",
    "the latter most likely are partially compensated by additional zn substitution .",
    "for magnetite the electrical conduction above the verwey transition is believed to be determined by the hopping of the spin - down electrons between the mixed - valent fe@xmath10 and fe@xmath11 ions on the @xmath8 sublattice . from the hopping amplitude",
    "@xmath78ev an electron conduction bandwidth @xmath79ev is expected . however , experimental data can not be explained within a simple band theory . they can be better ascribed to some thermally activated motion of charge carriers .",
    "the reason is that the bare hopping amplitude and bandwidth is strongly reduced due to the translation of a polaronic lattice deformation associated with electron motion@xcite .",
    "if the reduced bandwidth is smaller than the energy of polarization phonons ( typically 70mev in magnetite ) , small polaron hopping is expected@xcite .",

    "<S> the ferrimagnetic spinel oxide zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 combines high curie temperature and spin polarization with tunable electrical and magnetic properties , making it a promising functional material for spintronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> we have grown epitaxial zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 thin films ( @xmath3 ) on mgo(001 ) substrates with excellent structural properties both in pure ar atmosphere and an ar / o@xmath4 mixture by laser molecular beam epitaxy and systematically studied their structural , magnetotransport and magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the electrical conductivity and the saturation magnetization can be tuned over a wide range ( @xmath5 and @xmath6/f.u . at room temperature ) by zn substitution and/or finite oxygen partial pressure during growth . </S>",
    "<S> our extensive characterization of the films provides a clear picture of the underlying physics of the spinel ferrimagnet zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 with antiparallel fe moments on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 sublattice : ( i ) zn substitution removes both fe@xmath9 moments from the @xmath7 sublattice and itinerant charge carriers from the @xmath8 sublattice , ( ii ) growth in finite oxygen partial pressure generates fe vacancies on the @xmath8 sublattice also removing itinerant charge carriers , and ( iii ) application of both zn substitution and excess oxygen results in a compensation effect as zn substitution partially removes the fe vacancies . both electrical conduction and magnetism </S>",
    "<S> is determined by the density and hopping amplitude of the itinerant charge carriers on the @xmath8 sublattice , providing electrical conduction and ferromagnetic double exchange between the mixed - valent fe@xmath10/fe@xmath11 ions on the @xmath8 sublattice . a decrease ( increase ) of charge carrier density results in a weakening ( strengthening ) of double exchange and thereby a decrease ( increase ) of conductivity and the saturation magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is confirmed by the observation that the saturation magnetization scales with the longitudinal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of tailored zn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 films with semiconductor materials such as zno in multi - functional heterostructures seems to be particularly appealing . </S>"
