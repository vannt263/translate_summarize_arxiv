    "the understanding of electronic structure of vortex core in superconductors and spectrum of excitations in its vicinity is important for the manipulation of the critical properties of the superconducting materials . in low temperature limit",
    "they known to determine the static and dynamic properties . in the seminal work of @xcite the existence of the bounded states localized near the vortex core",
    "was demonstrated .",
    "the striking feature of the caroli - de gennes - matricon ( cdgm ) solution is that the energy spectrum similar to the landau levels with the effective region of localization is of order of vortex core radius @xmath2 corresponding to the effective field of order @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the effective magnetic field of order @xmath4 is due to coherent andreev reflection from the couper pair condensate which is characterized by the spatially profile of the order parameter @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "also the spectrum of the lowest bound states does not depend essentially on the specific spatial profile of the order parameter .",
    "in fact the linear dependence the energy of these states on @xmath6 is determined by the limiting slope parameter @xmath7 .",
    "selfconsistent treatment in @xcite showed that this slope parameter diverges in the quantum limit @xmath8 .",
    "the shrinking of the core region leads to a reduction in the number of bound states @xcite .",
    "singular behavior of the order parameter is expected from the general reasonings about gapless character of the fermionic excitations @xcite . according to @xcite",
    "the structure of @xmath5 can be even more complex and is characterized by additional scale @xmath9 , which separates the regions at the point where the jump of the derivative of the order parameter occurs .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 also determines the distance where the supercurrent density reaches its maximum @xcite .",
    "so we treat the distance @xmath10 as another characteristic length scale of the vortex core .",
    "thus the structure of the vortex core is far from trivial even in the limit @xmath11 due to singularities caused by both the point - like structure of the defect and the spatial distribution of @xmath12 .",
    "thus the electronic structure of the vortex core and the behavior of the order parameter are strongly correlated in the limit @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose the model hamiltonian for the description of the lowest bound state of the cdgm branch which is explicitly based on the singular behavior of the slope @xmath13 in the quantum limit .",
    "the independence of the spectrum on the specific spatial profile of the order parameter @xmath5 follows directly .",
    "the idea is based on the results @xcite where the self - conjugate extensions for the aaronov - bohm ( ab ) hamiltonian were studied .",
    "the key parameter is the part of flux quantum @xmath14 localized within the core .",
    "it should be noted that the standard ab effect for the abrikosov vortex was taken into account for the scattering states and has little impact on the cdgm bound states @xcite . from this point of view",
    "the important result of @xcite is that there exists the boundary conditions under which there is the bound state in the vicinity of the localized magnetic flux .",
    "this state is qualitatively different from the bound state in the potential well because it is caused in essential by the localized magnetic flux .",
    "this grounds the possibility of the treatment of the lowest bound states of the bogolubov - de gennes hamiltonian with the help of self - conjugate extensions for ab hamiltonian .",
    "thus we give the physical interpretation for the nonstandard boundary conditions ( or equivalently the self - conjugate extensions ) for ab hamiltonian .",
    "the paper is set out as follows . in section  [ sec_ham ]",
    "we consider the relation between the bdg hamiltonian for the quasiparticle excitations and the self - conjugate extension of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) hamiltonian .",
    "we show that these hamiltonians are equivalent for the low lying energy states localized near the vortex core . in section  [ sec_bound ]",
    "we use the above result to study the dependence of the energy of the bound state on the relevant parameters and show how this can be used to explain the results of @xcite in our approach . in conclusion the summary of the results is given and some problems for the further studies are listed .",
    "theoretical investigations of the quasiparticle spectrum around the vortex structure in the clean limit at low temperatures is based on the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian ( bdgh ) @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fermi energy , the vector potential @xmath17 of the applied magnetic field of order @xmath18 while the gradient term is for the magnetic field localized in the vortex .",
    "the order parameter @xmath5 has obvious asymptotic behavior : @xmath19 and should be determined consistently . to find the spectrum for some specific model for @xmath12",
    "can be used .",
    "commonly , @xmath12 is taken in the form ( see @xcite ) : @xmath20    but in low temperature limit because of kramer - pesch anomaly @xcite the increase of @xmath12 to the asymptotic value @xmath21 occurs at the distance @xmath2 much smaller than @xmath22 namely @xmath23@xcite : @xmath24 @xmath25\\,,\\,\\ , \\text{kramer\\&pesch } \\cite{sc_vortexcorekramerpesch_zphys1974 } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] due to presence of two length scales @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is natural that for the materials with @xmath0 the vortex can be considered as the point - like singularity similar to that for the ab hamiltonian . as has been said above the appearance of the bound state",
    "is due to reflection of the excitation from the bose condensate of cooper pairs which is equivalent to the effective magnetic field of the order @xmath26 .",
    "therefore we interchange it by localized magnetic flux corresponding to such effective magnetic field : @xmath27    this corresponds to @xmath28-singularity effective magnetic field localized in the vortex core .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 gives the part of the magnetic flux corresponding to the region of the localization of the size @xmath10 . here",
    "the magnetic flux quantum @xmath30 corresponds to the excitation with charge @xmath31 .",
    "the total flux of the abrikosov vortex is @xmath32 so that @xmath33 . also we will use the dimensionless variables @xmath34 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian can be reduced into much simple one : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the self - conjugate extension for the ab hamiltonian @xmath37    here the gauge @xmath38 is used @xcite .",
    "the divergence of the slope @xmath39 at @xmath40 can be treated correctly via introducing the dimensionless parameter @xmath41 which determines according to @xcite the energy of the bound states .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath42 reminds the energy of landau levels .",
    "the effective region of localization is of order of vortex core radius @xmath2 which corresponds to the effective field of order @xmath4 .",
    "taking into consideration that @xmath43 and @xmath44@xcite for @xmath45 at @xmath46 where @xmath47 is as following : @xmath48 and therefore @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass of the excitation , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is an odd integer ) are the angular momentum quantum numbers . also considering that in the quantum limit the size of the vortex core @xmath53@xcite then the magnetic flux which localized in the vortex core is defined as @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath55 has the form : @xmath56    thus the inner structure of the vortex is encoded into the parameters of the proper boundary conditions for .",
    "the parameters of these conditions are related with the physical parameters of the limit @xmath57 such as @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( note that @xmath60 corresponds to @xmath61 ) when the slope of the order parameter @xmath62 becomes singular .",
    "it should be noted that the quadratic dependence @xmath55 on @xmath59 is due to assumption of the homogeneity of the effective field while taking the singular limit .",
    "in general some scaling behavior can be expected @xmath63 . to estimate the value of @xmath55 for real materials and to check the scaling we use the experimental data of @xcite for superconductors in which @xmath64 . this way it is possible to find the dependence of @xmath55 on the ratio @xmath65 . in the quantum limit",
    "the value @xmath66 lies in the interval @xmath67 . based on the experimental data of @xcite",
    ", we can plot on a logarithmic scale the dependence @xmath66 of @xmath68 in the quantum limit for different values of @xmath68 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ xi_k ] and approximated by the formula @xmath69 which leads to : @xmath70    for example in the quantum limit for the @xmath71 ( @xmath72 with @xmath73 @xcite ) we get @xmath74 .",
    "it is natural that for @xmath75 the parameter @xmath55 vanishes .",
    "on @xmath68 .",
    "the points represent the data from @xcite . ]",
    "now we use general results on spectrum of reduced hamiltonian obtained in @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial spectrum in extended ab problem is determined by the radial part of the ab hamiltonian in the cylindrical coordinates : @xmath76    according to the theory of self - conjugate extensions for the ab hamiltonian generally there is 4-parametric set of boundary conditions for each value of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "but if one requires that the hamiltonian commutes with the angular momentum operator then this can be reduced to only 2 parameters @xcite . in our case",
    "@xmath77 , there is only a one - parameter set of boundary conditions for each value of @xmath55 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 @xmath80\\ ] ] and @xmath1 is the corresponding parameter of the boundary condition .",
    "the energy of the ground state is @xmath81    note , that both parameters @xmath55 and @xmath6 enter the hamiltonian in the same way .",
    "we need to determine the slope of the dispersion law of using at @xmath21 fixed . to do this",
    "we take into account that the eigenvalues of depend on the combination @xmath82 .",
    "therefore if the gap @xmath21 is fixed @xmath83    from eq .",
    "we obtain : @xmath84    from the another hand - side according to : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the euler s constant and @xmath87@xcite with @xmath88 .",
    "this choice of @xmath89 corresponds to the landau levels with magnetic field of @xmath4 from eq .  .",
    "comparing eq .   and",
    "eq .   we obtain the equation for the parameter @xmath1 : @xmath90 which has the solution : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is lambert @xmath92-function .",
    "self - consistent numerical solution of bogoliubov - de gennes equations in the quantum limit for clean @xmath93-wave superconductor was performed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the shrinking of the core region leads to a reduction in the number of bound - quasiparticle state energy levels .",
    "the spectrum is a function of the parameter @xmath68 . in particular for large values of @xmath94 the energy of the ground state ( @xmath77 ) was fitted by the formula : @xmath95    using eq .",
    "and eq .   from eq",
    ".   for @xmath96 we get the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath97    such behavior is due to the fact that @xmath98 the energy @xmath99 tends to the cdgm ground state . in fig .  [ fig_energy ] the comparison of our result with that of hayashi n. , _ et .",
    "@xcite is shown .",
    "note that asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy differs from the empirical result of hayashi n. , _ et .",
    "al . _ and has better agreement for large values @xmath94 .",
    "besides this we did nt use any fitting parameter and the result in a self - consistent way independent of gdgm formula .     as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "the solid curve show the result of eq .   at @xmath1 given by eq .",
    "the dashed line shows eq .  , the dotted line is the dependence of @xmath100 on @xmath68 for @xmath101 .",
    "the open circles correspond to the numerical calculations of @xcite . ]",
    "we have shown that the consideration of the low lying bound states localized in the vicinity of the vortex core can be investigated with the help of the formalism developed for ab hamiltonian in @xcite . from the other side",
    "it gives the interpretation of the nonstandard boundary condition for self - conjugate extensions of this hamiltonian in @xcite .",
    "our results shows that the nonstandard boundary conditions for ab hamiltonian can be interpreted in terms vortex core with the localized magnetic flux within the kramer - pesch singularity for the slope of @xmath12 . within the proposed approach such singularity",
    "is treated correctly .",
    "as suggested in @xcite another possibility for the bound vortex states can be realized in case of the vortex pinned by the insulating cylindrical defect .",
    "since such situation can be naturally described as the superposition of common zero - radius potential with the localized vortex it is interesting to consider the interplay between these two types of singular constituents of the vortex core potential .",
