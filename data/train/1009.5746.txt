    ", we say that @xmath0 is positive recurrent if for any @xmath27 and any open neighborhood @xmath28 of the origin ( see appendix   for elaboration ) .",

    "the following classes of matrices are of interest .",
    "first , a @xmath3 matrix @xmath5 is said to be an @xmath29-_matrix _ if there exists a @xmath1-vector @xmath30 0 such that @xmath31 ( or equivalently , if there exists @xmath32 such that @xmath33 ) , and @xmath5 is said to be _",

    "references for the following key results can be found in the survey paper by @xcite : there exists a diffusion process @xmath0 of the form described above if and only if @xmath5 is a completely @xmath29 matrix ; and moreover , @xmath0 is unique in distribution whenever it exists .",
    "hereafter we assume that @xmath5 is completely-@xmath29 .",
    "its diagonal elements must then be strictly positive , so we can ( and do ) assume without loss of generality that @xmath39 this convention is standard in the srbm literature ; in sections [ sec : spiraling ] through [ sec : lemmas ] of this paper ( where our main results are proved ) another convenient normalization of problem data will be used .",
    "appendix explains the scaling procedures that justify both ( [ eq : new1.5 ] ) and the normalized problem format assumed in sections [ sec : spiraling ] through [ sec : lemmas ] .",
    "we are concerned in this paper with conditions that assure the stability of @xmath0 .",
    "an important condition in that regard is the following : @xmath40 if @xmath5 is an @xmath38-matrix , then ( [ 15 ] ) is known to be necessary and sufficient for stability of @xmath0 ; @xcite prove that result and explain how the structure arises naturally in queueing network applications .",
    "@xcite further prove the following three results : first , ( [ 15 ] ) is necessary for stability in general ; second , when @xmath41 , one has stability if and only if ( [ 15 ] ) holds and @xmath5 is a @xmath37-matrix ; and third , ( [ 15 ] ) is not sufficient for stability in three and higher dimensions , even if @xmath5 is a @xmath37-matrix . in appendix of this paper , we provide an alternative proof for the first of these results , one that is much simpler than the original proof by @xcite .",

    "section [ sec : bek - example ] of this paper reviews the ingenious example by @xcite that serves to establish the third result , that an srbm can be unstable , cycling to infinity even if ( [ 15 ] ) holds ; theorem  [ thm:4 ] in this paper , together with the examples provided in section [ sec : divergent ] , shows that instability can also occur in other ways when ( [ 15 ] ) holds .    a later paper by @xcite established sufficient conditions for stability of srbms in three dimensions , relying heavily on the foundational theory developed by @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we show that the conditions identified by@xcite are also necessary for stability when @xmath42 ; the relevant conditions are easy to verify or refute via simple computations . as a complement to this work , an alternative proof of the sufficiency result by @xcite",
    "is also being prepared for submission ; cf .",
    "the  remainder of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , to allow precise statements of the main results , we introduce in section [ sec : lcp ] the `` fluid paths '' associated with an srbm , and the linear complementarity problem that arises in conjunction with linear fluid paths .",
    "that section , like the paper s first three appendices , considers a general dimension @xmath1 , whereas all other sections in the body of the paper consider @xmath42 specifically .",
    "section [ sec : bek - example ] identifies conditions under which fluid paths spiral on the boundary of the state space @xmath43 .",
    "section  [ sec:3d - results ] states our main conclusions , which are achieved by combining the positive results of @xcite with negative results that are new ; figure  [ fig:3 ] in section  [ sec:3d - results ] summarizes succinctly the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability when @xmath42 , and indicates which components of the overall argument are old and which are new . in sections  [ sec : spiraling ] through [ sec : lemmas ] , we prove the new `` negative results '' referred to above , dealing first with the case where fluid paths spiral on the boundary , and then with the case where they do not .",
    "as stated above , appendix   reviews the precise definition of srbm ; appendix   explains the scaling procedures that give rise to normalized problem formats and appendix   contains a relatively simple proof that ( [ 15 ] ) is necessary for stability .",

    "indeed , the last paragraph on page 698 in @xcite provides a sketch of that proof .",
