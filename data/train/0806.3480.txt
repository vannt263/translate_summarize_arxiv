    "there is a certain class of mathematical problems which , being quite difficult to solve for an adult mathematician in their most general setting , can be understood and even be approached to in some particular cases by little kids .",
    "this paper is devoted to a problem of such a kind .",
    "everybody knows the `` minesweeper '' computer game .",
    "a subset of a rectangular table is filled with `` mines '' and in every spare cell the number of neighbouring mines is indicated .",
    "the general problem can be formulated as follows : given a subset of the spare part of the table with the correspondent numbers of neighbouring mines , is there a unique way to reconstruct the original distribution of mines ?",
    "this problem in some simple cases can be used very fruitfully when teaching mathematics in primary school , since it allows to do it while playing and does not actually require a computer .",
    "the first experience of this kind belongs to the second author , who proposed for his pupils to reconstruct the distribution of mines in tables of the following type : @xmath0 the result was very successful , our colleagues in several aveiro schools started using such tasks .",
    "the only practical problem we had was creating new tables so that the distribution of mines would be determined uniquely by the open area ( this simplifies checking whether the solution is correct ) and that the solution would not be too easy .",
    "eventually , we found a form of the set to be open that guarantees the existence of a unique solution , finding which in most cases requires some thought . as an open set we propose to take the set of staggered cells of the initial table , in the form of a chess table . in what follows we state and",
    "prove the corresponding theorem .",
    "in the first version of the present paper @xcite we restricted ourselves to the case of rectangular fields as it is in the classical computer `` minesweeper '' game .",
    "now we decide first to give a formal description of `` paper minesweeper '' .",
    "the reason for such a formalization is that , as our experience with different types of fields shows , the spirit of the game is not strictly connected with the rectangularity of the field .",
    "particularly , our experience with tables based on the triangle tiling of the plane shows that the paper version of this game encounters situations typical for the computer `` minesweeper '' game .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite undirected graph has a certain graphical representation , such that each vertex represents a cell in which either a `` mine '' or a number can potentially be located .",
    "] , with vertex set @xmath2 and edge set @xmath3 .",
    "we say that two vertices @xmath4 are _ neighbors _ , if they are connected by an edge , that is , if @xmath5 .",
    "thus , for every @xmath6 we can define its _ neighborhood _ , @xmath7 , as the the set of neighbors @xmath8 a pair @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is called an _ opening _ if there is a subset @xmath12 , such that for every @xmath13 , @xmath14    by _ solving _ an opening @xmath9 we shall mean finding the corresponding set @xmath15 . respectively , @xmath16 will be called the _ set of open cells _ and @xmath15 will be called the _ set of mines_.    [ d : table ] an opening @xmath9 is called a _ table for `` paper minesweeper '' _ if and only if it admits a unique solution .",
    "uniqueness of the solution gives the possibility to compare the obtained answer with the right one .",
    "besides that , it makes the game deterministic , i.e. the presence or the absence of a mine in each cell is predetermined .    to prepare a table one can use the following algorithm : for each two subsets @xmath10 , @xmath17 we can define a function @xmath18 by construction , the set @xmath15 solves the opening @xmath19 , so it remains in this case to find out when the solution is unique .      in the computer `` minesweeper ''",
    "the table is an @xmath20 rectangular subset @xmath21 of @xmath22 , @xmath23 : @xmath24 for each @xmath25 the set of its neighbours is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27      to play the game we describe in its general setting you need a playing field ( for instance , printed on paper ) , a writing device ( for instance , a pen ) and a solution table .",
    "the playing field consists of `` open '' cells with numbers in them and `` closed '' cells which are to be filled by a player either with symbols of mines ( crosses , for instance ) , or by symbols of absence of mines ( dashes , for instance ) .",
    "the aim of the game is to fill all the `` closed '' cells in such a way that each number is equal to the number of mines in the neighbouring cells .",
    "each playing field should be supplemented by the definition describing which cells are to be called `` neighbours '' . according to definition [ d : table ] , a table with some of the cells filled by numbers",
    "is called _ a playing field for `` paper minesweeper '' _ if the distribution of mines can be restored uniquely .",
    "this particularly means that a player can check whether the obtained solution is correct by comparing it with the solution table .",
    "the first result in this direction appeared within the framework of a project of the second author s department after proposing school students of the @xmath28-th form to reconstruct the distribution of mines in a table @xmath29 with the upper string as @xmath16 . at that time",
    "the following theorem was proved :    [ t:2_times_n ] suppose that @xmath30 and that @xmath31 is not divisible by @xmath32 . let @xmath16 be one of the two strings of @xmath21 : @xmath33 then for every @xmath34 the opening @xmath35 admits only one solution .    to prove theorem [ t:2_times_n ] we used inductive calculation of @xmath32-diagonal determinants .",
    "the argument is quite simple , so we skip it .",
    "later on we obtained a more interesting theorem , which makes the main result of this paper :    [ t : chess ] suppose that @xmath36 the numbers @xmath31 and @xmath37 are coprime .",
    "let @xmath16 be the subset of @xmath21 in the form of a chess table : @xmath38 then for every @xmath34 the opening @xmath35 admits only one solution .",
    "let the neighbours of @xmath39 be defined by the following rule : @xmath40 where @xmath41    if we associate naturally the vertices of this graph with triangles in the triangle tiling of the plane , then this rule means that two triangles should be called neighbours if they have at least one common vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ trig ] ) .",
    "[ tr ] let @xmath42 , and let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be not divisible by @xmath45 .",
    "let neighbours be defined by the set @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 is a subset of @xmath21 in the form of a chess table : @xmath47 then for each set of mines @xmath34 the opening @xmath48 admits only one solution .",
    "it should be noticed that , due to the larger number of neighbours , games based on such tables have a higher level of complexity .",
    "it is curious that in these tables a player regularly encounters situations similar to those in the computer game .",
    "l45 mm [ trig ]",
    "before proving theorem [ t : chess ] we apply it to describe an algorithm of generating openings with unique solutions . in most cases",
    "the resulting opening will be nontrivial to solve .",
    "suppose that @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfying the conditions of theorem [ t : chess ] are chosen .",
    "set @xmath15 to be empty initially .",
    "\\1 . for every @xmath51",
    "we execute a bernoulli test , and if the result is @xmath52 , we add @xmath53 to @xmath15 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the test can be taken equal to @xmath56 .    \\2 .",
    "after having run through all the elements of @xmath57 we define @xmath58 by and fill all the cells @xmath59 with the values @xmath60 .",
    "an opening with a unique solution is ready .",
    "enjoy the game ! here are some examples of openings that can be obtained this way : @xmath61 the solutions can be found at the end of the paper .",
    "the first step of the algorithm can be modified in order to avoid the situation when for some @xmath59 one has @xmath62 we propose to fill up the first row independently and then fill all the other rows , starting with the second one and on downwards , filling each row from left to right and taking into account the distribution of mines already placed .",
    "consider the following pseudocode : + for i:=2 to m + for j:=1 to n + if @xmath63 then put a mine into the cell ( i , j ) + if @xmath64 then leave the cell ( i , j ) empty + end + end    a table obtained by the application of this algorithm can have cells satisfying the condition only in the last row .",
    "thus , in general , such tables are already more complicated .",
    "but if we want the inequality @xmath65 to be valid for every @xmath59 we should apply the previous algorithm for all the rows but the last one . and for the last row we should apply the following algorithm : + for j:=2 to n + if @xmath66 then put a mine into the cell ( m , j ) + if @xmath67 then leave the cell ( m , j ) empty + if @xmath68 then put a mine into the cell ( m , j ) + if @xmath69 then leave the cell ( m , j ) empty + end    note , however , that this procedure guarantees that there is no cell satisfying only in the case when the number of columns plus the number of rows is even . in the other case can hold for the cell @xmath70 .    these algorithms were realized in + http://www2.mat.ua.pt/jpedro/minesweeper/the-tablep.htm",
    "consider the opening @xmath9 . denote by @xmath71 the set of characteristic functions @xmath72 .",
    "we remind that there is a natural bijection between @xmath71 and the set of all the subsets of @xmath57 .",
    "namely , each @xmath34 corresponds to the function @xmath73 defined by the equality @xmath74 due to this bijection we can say that an element of @xmath71 solves the opening meaning that its support does . now , the condition that a function @xmath75 solves the opening @xmath9 can be written as a system of linear equations : @xmath76    since @xmath77 we can rewrite as @xmath78 we fix arbitrary orders on the sets @xmath79 .",
    "given these orders we can consider the matrix of the system [ equat2 ] and denote it by @xmath80 .",
    "this matrix is square , since @xmath81 is even and therefore @xmath82 . to prove the uniqueness of the solution of it suffices to show that @xmath80 is invertible . since the invertibility of @xmath80 does not depend on the order on @xmath21",
    ", we shall not specify the latter",
    ".    denote @xmath83    consider the real space @xmath84 .",
    "it is well known that the system @xmath85 forms a basis in @xmath86 .",
    "consider the operator @xmath87 acting on @xmath88 as multiplication by @xmath89 : @xmath90 note that @xmath91 denote @xmath92 @xmath93 it is easy to see that @xmath94 denote @xmath95 the matrix of the operator @xmath96 coincides exactly with the transpose of @xmath80 ( it is supposed that bases in @xmath97 and @xmath98 are chosen in accordance with the orders on @xmath16 and @xmath99 , which were used to define the matrix @xmath80 ) .",
    "thus it suffices to show that @xmath96 is invertible .",
    "the subspace @xmath97 is invariant under the action of @xmath100 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath100 to @xmath97 coincides with @xmath101 .",
    "thus , if we prove that @xmath100 is invertible , so will be both @xmath96 and @xmath102 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath87 coincides with the set @xmath103 to show this it suffices to notice that the functions defined by the equalities @xmath104 are eigenfunctions of @xmath87 : @xmath105 we get that @xmath106 is an eigenvalue of @xmath87 if and only if there are integers @xmath107 , such that @xmath108 but this is not so , since @xmath37 and @xmath31 are coprime .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is invertible , which proves the theorem .",
    "the proof is quite similar in this case , save that @xmath87 now acts as @xmath109 where the summation is taken over all the pairs @xmath110 this operator is not symmetrical and thus can not be represented as multiplication by a function in @xmath88 .",
    "same as we did before , we can define spaces @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and operators @xmath102 and @xmath96 .",
    "now our objective is also to find out whether @xmath96 has maximal rank . indeed , by our definition of sets @xmath16 and we have @xmath111 in case of odd @xmath81 and @xmath112 in case of even @xmath81 ( see pict ) .",
    "in the latter case maximality of rank means invertibility of @xmath96 .    by straightforward calculations we obtain that @xmath113 acts as @xmath114 where @xmath115 f(x , y ) , \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad ( x , y ) \\in p \\vphantom{\\bigg| }     \\end{split}\\ ] ] or @xmath116 we have @xmath117 we can not have @xmath118 , since @xmath119 , and so , @xmath120 .",
    "hence @xmath121 , which means that @xmath31 is a multiple of @xmath45 , since @xmath122 thus , the second equation of is equivalent to @xmath123 .",
    "this , together with the first equation of , implies that @xmath124 hence @xmath37 is a multiple of @xmath125 theorem [ tr ] is proved .",
