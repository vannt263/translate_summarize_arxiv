    "<S> thus , the kerr parameter @xmath11 is expected to scale to zero ( albeit slowly ) as the black hole threshold is approached . incidentally , </S>",
    "<S> this picture could be altered significantly if the numerical evidence of @xcite proves correct , and there is a _ non - spherical _ unstable mode of the critical solution .    in general , numerical exploration of angular momentum in the collapse of a single real scalar field would require a 3d code , for axisymmetric distributions of such a matter source can not carry angular momentum . constructing a general relativistic 3d simulation capable of resolving the range of length scales that unfold in scalar field critical collapse is a daunting project , and may require computational capacity not currently available . </S>",
