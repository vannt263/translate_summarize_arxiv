    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) can be instructed either by adopting the schemes proposed by its inventors ( born , heisenberg , schrdinger , jordan ) or , more rigorously , following dirac , within the hilbert space framework , or even using feynman s path integral approach . as it is believed to be pedagogically more appealing ,",
    "almost all textbooks prefer to begin with the nonrelativistic approach , discussing the wave - particle dualism , wavefunctions , schrdinger equation , hilbert space , non - commutative operators , etc .",
    "however , looking at the emblematic dynamical equations of schrdinger and dirac , one notes that the schrdinger equation ( se ) is less fundamental than dirac s relativistic equation , because this one contains inherently the internal degree of freedom spin , while it is absent in the former . in between",
    "there is the pauli - schrdinger equation ( pse ) , which was derived by pauli when he applied the low energy approximation in dirac equation .",
    "although being nonrelativistic yet the pse is more complete than se because the spin is inherently present , while in the se the spin must be added as an extra degree of freedom .",
    "see references in hestenes for a detailed discussion .    in the beginning of the 1980 s the possibility of quantum computation",
    "was foreseen by people like benioff , feynman and deutsch benioff , feynman , deutsch , and their work influenced a mini - revolution that began in the 1990 , which threw a new look in qm , mainly in its interpretation and potentialities to explain new phenomena ; in the last 15 years we have witnessed huge theoretical developments along with ingenious experiments involving single or few atoms or molecules , electrons and photons .",
    "so , the understanding of quantum physics has widen , shaping the new arena called _ quantum information theory ( qit ) _ that borrowed many concepts of classical information theory . in this context",
    "it seems to exist a recognition @xcite that qm is a special kind of information theory immersed in hilbert space , and characterized by a reversible logic bennett , divicenzo , fredkin .    in that connection , by using elementary concepts of communication theory , as bits and gates , however represented in the framework of hilbert space , i will show here that a quantum evolution equation for one classical bit ( _ _ cbit__@xmath0 _ _  _ _ as defined in @xcite ) or quantum bit ( _ qubit _ ) of information can be derived .",
    "then , by asking what could be the _ carrier _ of one qubit ( or spin  1/2 ) , the natural choice is a particle of mass _ m _",
    "characterized by its kinetic energy , and this information is introduced in the qubit dynamical equation .",
    "this procedure is sufficient to derive the pse that rules the time evolution of both , the qubit and the particle , its carrier .",
    "so , it ceases to be a particle in the newtonian sense to become a hybrid compelled to display wave properties and described by a wavefunction .",
    "the qubit / spin evolution acquires an ascendancy over the particle motion , being at the root of the observed quantum properties of matter .",
    "last but not least , the dirac equation and its solution are briefly discussed in terms of qubits .",
    "in classical information theory the numbers in @xmath1 are associated to bits , as in a relay or in a memory storage device .",
    "one can go one step further and associate a particular representation to the numbers 0 and 1 : a column matrix for one classical bit of information , the cbit state , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as like the states up  and down  for the spin 1/2 .",
    "these states can be written in the more familiar form of dirac s kets @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for @xmath7 , and the bras are the transposed , so @xmath8 @xmath9 is the dual space of @xmath10 .",
    "the qubit @xmath11 is a generalization of the cbit , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being complex numbers .",
    "the simplest operators to be used are the identity @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the not @xmath16 that inverts the cbit state , @xmath17 .",
    "so the 4-uple @xmath18 , @xmath19 plus the field of complex numbers @xmath20 are sufficient tools for my purposes .    the _ action _",
    "@xmath21 is a linear map of a cbit or qubit into a qubit , @xmath22 , for arbitrary parameter @xmath23 , @xmath24 in @xmath20 .",
    "let s first restrict the parameters values to two numbers : @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 is still a cbit because @xmath29 .",
    "the actions @xmath30 form a group : ( a ) the unit element is @xmath31 @xmath0 while @xmath32 ; ( b ) the inverse is @xmath33 @xmath34 ; ( c ) the product of two elements is an element in the group @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ; ( d ) the associative property @xmath38 holds , and the elements are unitary @xmath39 .",
    "sequential @xmath40 actions @xmath41applied on a cbit maps it into another cbit , @xmath42 , going through the intermediary states @xmath43 .",
    "each set of numbers @xmath44 defines one _ history _ , or _",
    "trajectory_. one can also write @xmath45 by changing the label of the cbit state , and by a trivial formal manipulation it is simple to show that @xmath46 , identifying the label as the mapped bit @xmath47 . by induction @xmath48 for @xmath49 . also holds the transitivity property expressed by the composition law @xmath50the sequence of actions ( [ evol ] ) is reversible since each one is unitary , then @xmath51 .",
    "the reverse history is given by the sequence @xmath52 .",
    "in summary , ( [ evol ] ) carries the evolution @xmath53 @xmath54 , and @xmath55 does the inverse path , @xmath56 .",
    "formally , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the same since each factor in eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) commutes with all others .",
    "i now assume the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath59 to be real , with @xmath60 and ask @xmath61 , so @xmath62 is the set of all real numbers on a circle of radius @xmath63 .",
    "as so , acting on a cbit one gets a qubit , @xmath64 .",
    "two consecutive operations give @xmath65 , and as @xmath66 @xmath67 , it follows that @xmath68 , so @xmath69 and @xmath70 is _ not _ an element of the group , unless one of the four coefficients is zero , therefore any probabilistic interpretation for @xmath71 and @xmath72 fails .",
    "moreover , the inverse action is @xmath73 , where the new parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 are _ not _ in @xmath76 . due to the reality of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath77 is a self - adjoint operator @xmath78 however it is _ _  _ _ not unitary since @xmath79 .",
    "although the norm @xmath80 is parameter independent , this is not true for the inverse @xmath81 .",
    "thus , if we want to construct an evolution operator @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , that is also reversible , we are in trouble .",
    "since the inverse of @xmath84 is @xmath85 , for a sequence of @xmath40 inverse actions we have @xmath86 , however as @xmath87 , therefore normalization is not possible .      in order to establish the invertibility of @xmath88 , the domain of @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "must be be extended to the field of complex numbers because the conditions @xmath89 and @xmath90 must be satisfied .",
    "this happens for @xmath23 real and @xmath91 , a pure imaginary .",
    "since one is left with one free parameter , a natural parametrization is @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 real ) , thus @xmath95  is a unitary operator mapping a cbit or a qubit into a qubit , @xmath96 .",
    "so , the complex nature of @xmath97 is due to its invertibility property .",
    "a sequence of actions @xmath98on a cbit @xmath99 takes it to the qubit @xmath100 , with coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the parameters @xmath103 are undetermined and their sum is @xmath104 , so one can write ( [ u-1n ] ) in the compact form@xmath105 , \\label{uexp}\\]]where @xmath106 is interpreted as a register parameter , it sets the ordering of the actions . due to the indetermination of the parameters @xmath107 nothing can be said about the intervals between consecutive actions , see figure ( [ sequen]-a ) , the vertical bars stand for each action , they can be distributed at will , although obeying an ordered sequence . imposing the composition law ( trans1 )",
    "one has @xmath108 , and the form ( [ uexp ] ) implies @xmath109 ; as so , necessarily and uniquely @xmath106 must be linear in @xmath40 , @xmath110 with @xmath111 some parameter .",
    "thus @xmath112 becomes @xmath113 $ ] , which stands for a sequence of actions , or an evolution .",
    "the previously undetermined intervals between actions become equally spaced , see figure ( [ sequen]-b ) , characterizing the _ uniformization _ of their distribution . in order to turn the distribution dense",
    "i shall look for a differential equation for @xmath114 by taking first the difference between two consecutive values of @xmath40 and then dividing by @xmath111 , @xmath115 .\\]]the limit to a continuous parameter is obtained for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , keeping however the product @xmath118 finite . a linear differential equation results , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the continuous ordering parameter of the actions , or a local _ _  time  _ _ in arbitrary units , that should be set according to the clock to be used .",
    "writing @xmath122 the evolution equation @xmath123 says how a qubit evolves due to the action of @xmath16 , which is the generator of the changes .",
    "defining a more general generator , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 being two real parameters , the evolution equation writes @xmath127with @xmath128 for the evolution operator . differently from the factor @xmath129 that do really affect the evolution of a qubit , the phase factor @xmath130 is apparently no significant because , besides a global phase factor , it does not entail any change when acting on cbit or qubit .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath131 are respectively @xmath132 , @xmath133 . a general solution to eq .",
    "( eqsch2 ) is @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "now conjecturing about the qubit carrier , i assume it a massive particle @xcite and the parameter @xmath125 is chosen to represent its energy ; thus the change @xmath136 @xmath131 is important because it allows the introduction of that particle property .",
    "@xmath131 can be identified as a hamiltonian , and for an arbitrary initial condition the mean value is @xmath137 ; while @xmath125 is the particle kinetic energy , the second term is the qubit energy that exists only when it is coupled to some field ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the spatial localization of the carrier must be introduced into eq .",
    "( eqsch2 ) , thus for a qubit state @xmath139 the parameters @xmath140 should depend on the position @xmath141 , namely , @xmath142 becomes the state of the whole system , with normalization @xmath143 .",
    "the qubit state is correlated to the particle position that influences its probability outcomes @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "coordinate dependence should also be present in the generator , so @xmath146 and the parameter @xmath126 is assumed @xmath141-independent because interaction between both degrees of freedom is not considered .",
    "the evolved state is @xmath147 , with amplitudes @xmath148with @xmath149 and @xmath150 as initial values .",
    "so , the qubit was merged with the spatial motion of its carrier within a single equation , meaning that the joint evolution  the qubit sequence of actions as well as",
    "the change in the spatial configuration of the carrier  is measured by a single clock . to determine the parameters @xmath151 and @xmath150",
    "they should obey some differential equation for the variable @xmath141 , then @xmath152 must depend also on @xmath153 and/or its powers .",
    "however , instead of trying to guess the functional form , it is better to take advantage of the available information from hamiltonian mechanics , so i define @xmath125 as the kinetic energy of a non - relativistic particle , @xmath154 @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the linear momentum in some reference frame .",
    "( [ eqsch2 ] ) becomes @xmath157 \\left\\vert \\tilde{\\psi}\\left ( p,\\tau \\right ) \\right\\rangle $ ] .",
    "since @xmath158 has units of energy , the second term in brackets should also have the same units .",
    "so the constants @xmath159 and @xmath160 , have both units of energy .",
    "one can also choose some unit to measure the dimensionless time @xmath121 , @xmath161 , so the dynamical equation becomes@xmath162 \\left\\vert \\tilde{\\psi}\\left ( p , t\\right ) \\right\\rangle ,   \\label{schreq2}\\]]where @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "note that the constant @xmath165 has units of energy @xmath166 time and @xmath167 has units of energy .",
    "an arbitrary initial condition assumes that the particle momentum and the qubit state are correlated and the probability amplitude @xmath168depends on the particle momentum and it contains all the available information . in momentum space",
    "the evolution operator is @xmath169 $ ] and the solution to eq .",
    "( [ schreq2 ] ) is@xmath170\\]]with @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and the particle mean energy is @xmath173 . since coordinate and momentum are conjugated variables the statevector in coordinate representation is @xmath174and @xmath175 , @xmath176 are the amplitudes associated to the cbits @xmath177 , @xmath178;@xmath179they can be written as fourier transforms @xmath180the constant @xmath181 is introduced to set the correct dimensionality , it has the same units as @xmath165 , nonetheless nothing can be said about being the same constant , unless confirmed by experiment . in eq .",
    "( [ schreq22 ] ) @xmath182with @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "so even not existing a direct interaction between the qubit and its carrier , the probability for measuring the qubit in cbit @xmath99 , or @xmath185 , becomes affected by its position .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ schreq22 ] ) and ( [ psi02 ] ) and manipulating eq .",
    "( schreq2 ) it is not hard to verify that one can substitute the c - number @xmath156 by the derivative @xmath186 , and we can rewrite that equation as @xmath187 \\left\\vert \\psi \\left ( q , t\\right ) \\right\\rangle .",
    "\\label{schreq3}\\]]the terms in brackets stand for the particle and qubit hamiltonian in coordinate and matrix representation , so the parameter @xmath125 becomes determined . in the presence of an energy conserving potential @xmath188",

    "( [ schreq3 ] ) has now blurred classical properties ( it looses the sharp trajectory it has in phase space ) , its best representation is a wavefunction and the appearance of quantum properties are due to the qubit it is carrying . any further generalization is trivial and immediate : ( 1 ) from 1-d to 3-d in spacial coordinates , @xmath191 and ( 2 ) since any @xmath192 matrix can be expanded in the basis formed by the unit matrix @xmath14 and pauli matrices ( @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 ) , then @xmath196 .",

    "also interesting is that all the @xmath219 matrices have the structure of the direct product of two - qubit operators @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 .",
    "as long as the qubit is not probed ( for a spin , there is no external magnetic field ) , @xmath225 , eq .",
    "( [ schreq3 ] ) reduces to two uncoupled schrdinger equations @xmath226for two wavefunctions @xmath227 , @xmath228 in one qubit / spin eigenstate .",
    "the two equations are redundant thus the relevant information resides in one of them only , going to the usual spinless se . although classical physics was crucial to arrive at eq .",
    "( [ schreq5 ] ) , by setting @xmath225 the particle motion is not ruled ( back ) by classical physics ( hamilton equations ) but by the usual se .",
    "so why do quantum properties of the particle still persist even when the correlation between a qubit / spin and its carrier is broken ?",
    "the answer is that even not being activated the qubit / spin is still carried by the particle , the internal degree of freedom and the particle make one single object , although not entangled .",
    "one is left with an equation ( se ) that does not keep any clue about the presence of a qubit / spin , nonetheless it is still there although not manifestly evident .",
    "that 's why the se can be used without any mention to spin if not needed ; otherwise , this internal degree of freedom must be appended in order to explain observed phenomena . in conclusion , because it is carrying one qubit of information , to the observer the particle shifts its behavior from the classical picture , it acquires wave properties with a probabilistic character where the uncertainty relations represent one facet .",
