    "biological membranes are lipid bilayers with different types of embedded or absorbed macromolecules . they serve a number of general functions in our cells and tissues @xcite . because of its biological importance , the physics of membrane adhesion has received considerable attention both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . for instance , helper t cells mediate immune responses by adhering to antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) which exhibit foreign peptide fragments on their surface .",
    "the apc membranes contain the ligands mhcp and icam-1 while the t cells contain the receptors tcr and lfa-1 .",
    "the experiments @xcite show the formation of domains into shorter tcr / mhcp receptor - ligand complexes and the longer lfa-1/icam-1 receptor - ligand complexes .",
    "the dynamics of adhesion - induced phase separation has been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "for example , the monte carlo study by weikl and lipowsky @xcite shows that the height difference between different junctions causes a lateral phase separation , and the formation of target - like immunological synapse is assisted by the motion of cytoskeleton .",
    "the equilibrium studies of adhesion - induced phase separation of multi - component membranes are also important for a complete understanding of the physics of membrane adhesion .",
    "for instance , in recent articles @xcite , the general case of two membranes binding to each other with two types of stickers is considered and the equilibrium phase behavior of such a system is studied at the mean field and gaussian level by including the effects of sticker flexibility difference , sticker height difference and thermally activated membrane height fluctuations .",
    "more recently , mesfin @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite presented a theoretical study that characterized the phase diagram and the scaling laws for the critical potential depth of unbinding and lateral phase separation .",
    "these studies show that membranes are unbound for small potential depths and bound for large potential depths . in the bound state , the length mismatch leads to a membrane - mediated repulsion between stickers of different lengths and this leads to lateral phase separation depending the concentrations and strengths of the receptor - ligand bonds .",
    "furthermore , the flexibilities of the stickers play non - trivial roles in the location of phase boundaries .",
    "most of these recent works deal with membranes with one or two types of stickers",
    ". however , biological membranes usually contain glycoproteins which are repulsive to another membrane or tissue , i.e. , they act as repellers .",
    "this important fact motivates us to study adhesion - induced lateral phase separation of membranes with short stickers , long stickers and repellers .",
    "another important but unexplored issue on adhesion - induced lateral phase separation in biomembranes is the effect of external pressure or confinement on the phase diagram .",
    "for example , cell adhesions often occur in the presence of external force field due to external flow , or the external force may be a result of the occurrence of cell adhesions in highly confined geometry during the development of multicellular organisms . to study the effect of repellers and confinement on adhesion - induced lateral phase separation , in this article we first consider a membrane with short stickers and long stickers which are in contact with another planer surface ( substrate ) in the absence of repellers .",
    "the membrane and the substrate are confined between two hard walls .",
    "we find that the critical binding energies of the stickers for lateral phase separation increase as the distance between the hard walls decreases due to the steric repulsion of the membrane with the hard walls .",
    "then the effect of repellers are considered and we find that stiff repellers tend to enhance phase separation , while soft repellers tend to suppress phase separation . our study has revealed the possibility to manipulating the lateral distribution of stickers in future experiments .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the model of membranes with short stickers , long stickers and repellers . by tracing out sticker and repeller degrees of freedom , we get membranes that interact with an effective double - well potential .",
    "the adhesion - induced lateral phase separation in the presence of stickers and repellers is studied by mean field theory and monte carlo simulations in section iii .",
    "first we consider membranes with short and long stickers .",
    "we then consider membranes with short , long stickers and repellers .",

    "we also find that adding repellers reduce the effective binding energies of the stickers , and repellers play a non - trivial role in adhesion - induced phase separation : stiff repellers tend to enhance phase separation , soft repellers tend to suppress phase separation .",
    "these ideas are not difficult to check in experiments . for example , consider vesicle adhesion to supported membranes via two types of stickers .",
    "our analysis predicts that it is possible to mix the phase - separated stickers by simply compressing the vesicle against the supporting substrate .",
    "the effect of repellers can be checked by incorporating non - adhesive flexible polymers and stiff rod - like molecules to the vesicle surface , and examine the adhesion zone .",
    "flexible polymers should suppress lateral phase separation while stiff molecules should enhance lateral phase separation .",
    "we believe that these effects could be useful in the development of new sensitive soft materials with possible applications in future bio - technologies .",
