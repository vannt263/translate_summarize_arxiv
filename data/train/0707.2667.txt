    "if we perturb the xy model by a @xmath2-fold symmetry breaking potential ( the so called clock model ) , the previous scalar cg has to be extended : the clock potential translates into magnetic scalar charges@xcite .",
    "these magnetic charges mutually interact _ via _ the same coulomb potential , and their coupling with electric charges is a aharonov - bohm potential @xcite .",

    "an extension of the scalar ( electric ) coulomb gas is required in the study of the continuous melting transition of a two dimensional solid@xcite .",
    "this extension is twofold : ( i ) the topological charges of two dimensional dislocations are burgers vectors instead of integers and ( ii ) the interaction between these vector charges consist of the usual 2d coulomb potential ( _ i.e _ @xmath1 interaction ) , and an _ angular interaction _ which couples the charges to the vector @xmath3 joining the two defects .",

    "the natural extension of this vector cg to the electromagnetic case arises in the study of two dimensional melting in the presence of a translation symmetry breaking potential , _",

    "such a general vector electromagnetic cg has never been studied to our knowledge , and it is the purpose of the present paper to derive the rg equations describing its scaling behavior to lowest order .",
    "a preliminary study , motivated by the problem of a substrate with quenched disorder @xcite was published some time ago , and involved a replicated vecg @xcite .",
    "the present study provides a complete and general derivation of the rg equations valid for any type of substrate ( periodic and/or disordered ) .",
    "the vecg studied here can be viewed as an extension to the vector / elastic case of the scalar electromagnetic cg @xcite , and an extension to the electromagnetic case of the vector cg of @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the elasticity manifests itself not only in the angular interactions of the electric / electric and magnetic / magnetic potentials , but also into the electric / magnetic interaction which is no longer a simpler aharonov - bohm potential .    before turning to a more precise definition of our model ,",
    "let us mention the field theoretical approach to the cg problem .",

    "the cg charges appear as root vectors of lie algebra , and the charges of the @xmath5 toda field theory can be identified with burgers vectors of a triangular lattice . in this perspective",
    ", our present study corresponds to an extension to the non - conformal case where angular interactions are included of the @xmath5 study of boyanovsky and holman .",

    "we consider explicitly two important cases : the case of a periodic commensurate substrate , and the case of a random pinning substrate .",
