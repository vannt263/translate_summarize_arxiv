    "in earlier papers we described the physical process that causes modal instability@xcite in high power fiber amplifiers . a key aspect of this stimulated thermal rayleigh scattering ( strs ) process is a frequency offset between the two coupled modes , usually lp@xmath0 and lp@xmath1 .",
    "we have incorporated the physics of this strs process in a detailed , highly numerical model@xcite that can compute mode coupling gain as a function of the frequency offset .",
    "a typical gain curve is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in @xcite",
    "we argued that the frequency of peak gain could be roughly estimated as the inverse of the thermal diffusion time across the core radius .",
    "this implies the peak gain for typical large mode area fibers should lie in the frequency range 200 - 5000 hz .",
    "mode coupling gain plus lasing gain versus frequency offset for a large mode area fiber amplifier .",
    "the coupling is from lp@xmath0 to either lp@xmath1 or lp@xmath2 .",
    "the peak value of gain and its position vary with amplifier parameters.,width=432 ]    semi analytic versions of our model of strs have been presented by hansen_et al._@xcite .",
    "et al . _ also computed gain versus frequency offset , but with the assumptions that the transverse heat profile is proportional to the transverse irradiance profile and that the mode profiles are constant along the fiber .",
    "these simplifying assumptions permit the development of a compact model , but such models miss some of the subtleties of real amplifiers .",
    "for instance , in real amplifiers the shape of the mode coupling gain @xmath3 is altered by any change in the transverse heat deposition profile along the fiber , and depends not only on the core refractive index step and the doping profile , as found by hansen _",
    "et al . _ , but also on the bend radius , linear absorption of the signal due to photodarkening or other processes , thermal lensing , and with total thermal load if cooling is asymmetric .",
    "however , perhaps the most important difference between the simplified models and our more detailed model is related to changes in the transverse profile of the population inversion , or transverse hole burning , which dramatically alters the shape of the oscillating heat source responsible for strs as the balance between pump and signal powers changes .",
    "this is most noticeable in co - pumped amplifiers where the pump power falls while the signal power rises as they propagate down the fiber . however , hole burning is also important in counter - pumped amplifiers , even though the ratio of pump to signal powers is more nearly constant along the fiber .",
    "population depletion affects the magnitude of the mode coupling gain as well as its frequency profile , but its influence on the magnitude of gain will be the topic of other papers .    in this report we present modeling results for amplifiers operated at the gain peak and near the instability threshold .",
    "we expect our steady - periodic model to work well near threshold although it may be less useful for operation well above threshold . here",
    "we are primarily concerned with how the frequency that gives maximum gain near the instability threshold ( @xmath4 ) changes with fiber design and operating conditions .",
    "besides being an important test of our model , this information will be useful in future modeling since it reduces the scope of the two dimensional search required to find @xmath4 at the threshold .",
    "we also anticipate that measured values of @xmath4 will be useful in diagnosing causes of anomalously performance such as low instability thresholds .",
    "as we will show , different problems can have different influences on the frequency .",
    "even so , it is unlikely that in practice frequency information alone will uniquely identify such problems .",
    "in this section we show how @xmath4 varies with core size , using the simplifying assumption that the heat profile mimics the irradiance profile .",
    "this is the same approximation used by hansen _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "it gives a preliminary estimate of @xmath4 that we will improve on in the next section .",
    "for this preliminary computation we use a small linear signal absorption inside the doped region , with no pump absorption .",
    "this produces a heat profile proportional to the irradiance profile in the doped region .",
    "all the power lost to linear absorption is assumed to appear as heat that causes mode coupling via strs .",
    "we use a step index fiber with numerical aperture ( @xmath5 ) of 0.054 and a 976 nm pump .",
    "our peak frequencies for the 20 , 40 , and 80 @xmath6 m diameters agree closely with those of hansen _",
    "et al._@xcite even though we use a 1040 nm signal while hansen uses 1030 nm .",
    "this is expected because @xmath4 depends only on the shapes of the two modes and they do not change significantly over this wavelength range .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "2 .    frequency of peak gain ( @xmath4 ) _ vs _ @xmath7 of mode lp@xmath0 for a constant numerical aperture of 0.054 and a 1040 nm signal .",
    "the heat profile matches the irradiance profile over the doped region in this case .",
    "the circles are found using our numerical model for core diameters of \\{25 35 40 50 60 70 80 90 } @xmath6 m with corresponding effective areas of \\{380 645 805 1180 1630 2155 2755 3420 } , while the solid line is given by the best fit inset equation.,width=432 ]    the frequencies are well approximated by the equation @xmath8 where @xmath7 is the effective area of the lp@xmath0 mode in square microns and the signal wavelength is 1040 nm .",
    "this result can be compared with a frequency estimate based on the thermal diffusion time for a heated cylinder of radius @xmath9 @xmath10 which for silica thermal parameters",
    "( @xmath11 w / m - k , @xmath12 j / kg - k , @xmath13 kg / m@xmath14 ) gives @xmath15 the two frequencies computed using eqs .",
    "( [ eq.171 ] ) and ( [ eq.89 ] ) are equal if @xmath16 defining the mode field radius @xmath17 by @xmath18 means @xmath19 a reasonable result .    in the computations above we fixed the numerical aperture at @xmath20 . changing the @xmath5 changes the shape of the modes and thus the frequency .",
    "et al._@xcite showed the frequency increases as the @xmath21 parameter , or equivalently , the @xmath5 increases .",

    "the degree of depletion varies with the ratio of signal to pump irradiances , so it also varies along the length of the amplifier .",
    "figures [ fig.copowers ] and [ fig.counterpowers ] show how the signal and pump powers vary along the fiber for high efficiency co- and counter - pumped amplifiers . for the co - pumped amplifier the pump and signal powers are approximately equal midway along the fiber . for the counter - pumped amplifier they are approximately equal along most of the fiber . near the input of the co - pumped fiber",
    "the pump is much stronger than the signal so there is little population depletion , or hole burning , and the approximation of the previous section is nearly met , and @xmath4 is given by eq .",

    "the corresponding heat profiles midway along the fiber are shown as green curves in the two plots , and the profiles near the output are shown as red curves .",
    "for the same amplifier with counter - pumping the profiles are nearly constant along the fiber and are approximately the same as those near the midpoint of the co - pumped fiber .",

    "the assumption of the previous section which ignored hole burning as unimportant is highly dubious for real amplifiers , whether co- or counter - pumped .",
    "the outward displacement of the oscillatory heating means the asymmetry persists longer before it decays away by thermal diffusion , and this means @xmath4 is reduced as hole burning strengthens . for the co - pumped fiber",
    "most of the mode coupling gain occurs near the mid point , so the heat distribution at that location largely determines @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 for the counter - pumped fiber is approximately the same because the heat profile over the full fiber length is nearly the same as at the midpoint of the co - pumped fiber .",
    "full model runs using computed population inversions are used to predict realistic frequencies for the 20 , 40 , and 80 @xmath6 m diameter , 1.2 m long , co - pumped amplifiers of fig .",

    "it can be anticipated that if the yb@xmath29 dopant is confined to a smaller diameter than the core index step , the influence of hole burning on @xmath4 will be less than for a fully doped core because heating will be confined to the doped zone and can not broaden as much . keeping other fiber properties constant and varying only the doping diameter , hansen _",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the frequency for three doping diameters with a fixed refractive index profile .",
    "they showed @xmath4 increased with decreasing doping diameter .",
    "however , they used heat profiles proportional to the irradiance profiles .",

    "figure [ fig.doping ] shows our results .",
    "mode lp@xmath1 fraction at fiber output versus frequency offset for varying doping diameters in co - pumped fiber .",
    "the core diameter is fixed at 81 microns and the doping diameters are 81 , 72 , and 63 @xmath6 m ; @xmath30 m ; @xmath31 @xmath6 m ; @xmath25 m@xmath26 . in each case",
    "the pump power is adjusted to the mode instability threshold.,width=432 ]    in all three curves the power is near the mode instability threshold so the fraction of signal power in lp@xmath1 is approximately 0.3% at the output for the frequency of highest gain . the fiber is the step index equivalent of lpf45 ( @xmath32 @xmath6 m , @xmath31 @xmath6 m , @xmath30 m , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) with signal input in lp@xmath0=10 w , signal input in lp@xmath37 w. the gain peaks corresponding to doping diameters ( 63 , 72 , 81 ) @xmath6 m lie at frequencies ( 500 , 430 , 380 ) hz . there is probably no deep significance to it , but the product of @xmath4 and @xmath38 is nearly constant for these three cases .",
    "a lower value of the numerical aperture would allow the modes to expand slightly into the cladding , and this should reduce @xmath4 .",
    "this effect has been verified by hansen _ et al._@xcite . under the assumption of no hole burning .",
    "when the signal light is largely confined to the fundamental mode , as it is below and near threshold , the temperature peaks at the center of the core , and this causes thermal lensing , or self focusing of the signal light .",
    "the result is a constriction of the mode profiles which might be expected to cause an increase in @xmath4 .",
    "the thermal lensing effect is stronger in larger diameter fibers .",
    "for example , it can be quite significant in an 80 @xmath6 m diameter fiber operating at several hundred watts , but it is much less noticeable for a 20 @xmath6 m diameter fiber . in fig .",
    "[ fig.lensing ] we show the effective area of the fundamental mode versus position along the fiber for two cases , a short and a long fiber with identical 80 @xmath6 m diameter cores and equal pump cladding sizes .",
    "the length of one is 1.2 m , the other is 2.4 m. the core is doped over its full diameter , but at a density of @xmath39 m@xmath26 for the short fiber and half that for the long fiber .",
    "this makes the hole burning similar for the two , but the heat per length is halved in the longer fiber , reducing its thermal lensing . as the figure shows , lensing reduces @xmath7 near the mid point by 13% for the shorter fiber and 7% for the longer fiber .",
    "if @xmath4 scaled in proportion of @xmath40 this would cause a frequency shift of approximately 40 hz between the two fibers .",
    "in fact , the modeled frequency shift is only 20 hz , with the longer fiber having a lower frequency , as expected . the heat and lp@xmath1 gain profiles of the 1.2 m fiber are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.gainheat ] .",
    "the shift reduction is partly due to the fact that the gain peaks earlier in the fiber than the thermal lensing , and partly due to the fact that the gain is distributed over sections of fiber that have less lensing than the mid point .",
    "the result is that the effective frequency reduction is less than guessed based on the maximum reduction in @xmath7 .",
    "additionally , the smaller beam in the more strongly lensed short fiber leads to hole burning , and this also reduces @xmath4 by small amount , bringing its shift closer to that of the long fiber .",

    ", the added thermal lensing caused by absorptive heating will also pull toward higher frequency .",
    "however , if we use a photodarkening model in which the absorption is larger in areas with higher upper state population@xcite , the absorption will be strongest near the outer edge of the core , and this will tend to reduce @xmath4 .",
    "we have not tested the latter model , but we have verified the shift to higher frequencies with the former .",
