    "al . @xcite used the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations to calculate the tunneling conductance of normal metal / s - wave superconductor contacts , with a barrier of arbitrary strength between them , in terms of the probability amplitudes of andreev @xcite and normal reflection . in the andreev reflection process an electron incident , in the barrier",
    "can be reflected as an electron ( normal reflection ) , reflected as a hole without changing its momentum ( andreev reflection ) , it can also be transmitted into the superconductor as an electron - like , hole - like quasiparticle .",
    "recently the btk theory was extended by several groups to consider the anisotropy of the pair potential . in @xmath3-wave superconductors the pair potential changes sign under a @xmath4-rotation .",
    "so under appropriate orientation of the @xmath5-axis of @xmath3-wave superconductor the transmitted quasiparticle feel different sign of the pair potential .",
    "this results in the formation of bound states within the energy gap , which are detected as peaks in the conductance spectra . in @xmath3-wave superconductor",
    "the peak exists at @xmath6 for a great range of angles of incidence of the incoming electron .",
    "this range depends on the surface orientation .",
    "@xcite in particular for ( 110 ) surfaces the peak exists at @xmath6 for all angles of incidence , and disappears for the ( 010 ) or ( 100 ) surface .    in the presence of another barrier inside the normal metal additional subgap",
    "bound states exist due to multiple andreev reflections @xcite .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in @xmath3-wave superconductor / insulator / @xmath3-wave superconductor . in these systems",
    "the quasiparticle current has been examined by several groups @xcite , using btk formalism with recursive relations for the determination of the probability amplitudes .",
    "there is a competition between different pairing symmetries in the bulk .",
    "the coexistence of a subdominant order parameter in bulk depends on the strength of the secondary order parameter attractive interaction relative to the attractive interaction in the dominant pairing channel .",
    "when the secondary order parameter is strong enough a second phase transition occurs at a temperature @xmath7 which depends on the strength of the secondary order parameter .",
    "numerical results show that when such coexistence is realized the relative phase of the order parameters is @xmath8 leading to @xmath0 or @xmath1 pairing state in the bulk .",
    "the temperature dependence of the various thermodynamic quantities and transport properties change from power lows to exponential below @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite when the secondary order parameter is not strong enough , only the @xmath10-wave order parameter appears in the bulk . for @xmath11 surfaces the @xmath10-wave order parameter changes sign under reflection at the surface and vanishes at the surface . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath2 or @xmath12 does not change sign and are not effected by the presence of the surface , so there is the possibility of their presence near the surface even when their attractive interaction is not strong enough for them to exist in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the presence of the secondary order parameter near a surface is manifested in tunneling spectra as a splitting of the zero energy conductance peak ( zep ) at low temperatures at zero external field and further non - linear splitting with increasing external field .",
    "@xcite the field dependence of the splitting of the zep in the tunneling spectra of ybco has been examined @xcite . the observation is consistent with a @xmath0 surface order parameter or a @xmath1 order parameter .    in this paper",
    "we extend the btk formula to calculate the tunneling conductance in a normal metal / insulator / ( @xmath0)-wave , or ( @xmath1)-wave superconductor .",
    "in particular we find that in the @xmath0-state the conductance peak remains rigid at the energy of the subdominant ( @xmath2 ) order parameter .",
    "@xcite besides in the @xmath1 state , there is a plateau region inside the gap due to the formation of bound states at discreet values of the quasiparticle trajectory angle @xmath13 , for all junction orientations",
    ". also the evolution of the tunneling conductance with temperature depends on the nature of the subdominant order parameter .",
    "these features can be used to distinguish between states with broken time - reversal symmetry .",

    "however , the height of the conductance peak ( zeh ) depends on the orientation angle @xmath61 . for a given angle @xmath61",
    "the zeh is proportional to the range of @xmath13 angles for which sign change occurs .",

    "this observation can be used to explain the residual values of the tunneling conductance within the gap , seen in fig .",
    "[ did.fig ] as follows .",
    "when a bound state is formed the conductance @xmath51 is equal to @xmath96 exactly at the bound state energy for the two discreet values of @xmath13 and the peak in the @xmath70 should be proportional to the @xmath97 for large @xmath72 for these values of @xmath13 . for the rest of the quasiparticle trajectory angles @xmath13 the tunneling conductance @xmath70 ,",
    "has a constant value .",
    "thus the height for a given energy , and angle @xmath61 is determined from the interplay of two competitive factors , i.e. , the bound state energy formed at a couple of @xmath13 angles which gives a contribution proportional to @xmath97 , and the rest of @xmath13 angles which give a constant value contribution independent of @xmath72 .",
    "also the steps in @xmath13 , in evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "[ ss ] are very much crucial since the calculation of the tunneling conductance has to be performed exactly at the bound state energy .",
    "if this is not the case then the peak due to the bound states in the tunneling conductance would have a smaller value which would depends on @xmath72 in general .",
    "we conclude that in the @xmath1 the discreet values of the quasiparticle trajectory angle @xmath13 , over which a bound state is formed , compared to the interval of @xmath13 angles in the other two pairing states explains the reduced height of the tunneling conductance within the gap .",
    "however if we calculate the conductance @xmath104 , for the @xmath1 at a given @xmath61 for a value of @xmath13 for which bound state occurs then the conductance should develop a peak at the bound state energy , where @xmath104 is equal to @xmath96 .",

    "however as we change the angle @xmath13 towards @xmath8 the peak level moves from @xmath6 to @xmath107 .",
    "the occurence of residual density of states in the ( @xmath1)-wave case is unaffected by the calculation of @xmath70 including the self - consistency of the order parameter .",
    "@xcite in this calculation an enhancement appears at @xmath107 , for @xmath82 . in our calculation",
    "we also observed a similar enhancement at @xmath107 when the definition @xmath108 was used for the calculation of the tunneling conductance .",
    "the @xmath109 factor was included in the integration formula to calculate the @xmath15-component of the tunneling spectra . within this definition",
    "the bound state at @xmath110 contributes more ( due to the @xmath109 factor ) that the bound state at @xmath13 close to @xmath90 .",
    "as seen in figure [ didbs.fig ] the bound state at @xmath110 corresponds to energy @xmath107 causing the peak in @xmath70 at @xmath107 .",
    "also in a self consistent calculation the bound state at @xmath111 contribute less in @xmath70 that that at @xmath112 due to the depletion near the interface . in any case",
    "the peak near @xmath107 in ( @xmath1)-wave pairing state is much more suppressed that that at @xmath85 in ( @xmath113)-wave state .",
    "the angular dependence of the bound state energy for fixed boundary orientation at the @xmath114 plane can be used to identify the ( @xmath1)-wave pairing state .",
    "the method we propose here is the two point spectroscopy described by benistant et .",
    "@xcite . they measured the reflected hole distribution along the boundary @xmath14-direction , when electrons are injected with certain distribution @xmath115 , through a point contact , at @xmath116 , into a normal metal of thickness @xmath3 attached to an @xmath2-wave superconductor .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the @xmath117-axis deflects the trajectories of the electrons and leads to an asymmetric distribution of angles of incidence in the normal metal / superconductor interface .",
    "also the magnetic field focuses the reflected holes into a second point contact which acts as a hole collector . moving the second point contact around the first one or using several point contacts along the direction parallel to the interface we are able to measure the intensity of the andreev reflected holes as a function of the @xmath14 direction . in the @xmath2-wave case one",
    "observes a single peak called focusing peak at @xmath118 from the injection point at @xmath116 , since the andreev reflected probability amplitudes are independent of the injection angle . for the ( @xmath1)-wave case the bound state energies , for which the reflection coefficient is equal to one , occurs at angles @xmath119 , for a given boundary orientation and large barrier strength @xmath72",
    ". these bound states will give rise to a second peak in the hole distribution , at a different position , besides the one due to the focusing .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field leads to an asymmetric distribution of angles of incidence in the interface and the trajectory which corresponds to bound state at @xmath120 has shorter path from that at @xmath121 and the corresponding injected electrons have smaller angle @xmath122 .",
    "if the angular distribution probability @xmath115 of the injected particles is peaked at small injection angles , this will lead to larger contribution to the secondary peak from the bound state at @xmath120 then that at @xmath121 this new peak would be observed for all energies for which bound states exist in a ( @xmath1)-wave superconductor . in the case of a @xmath10-wave superconductor , and a ( @xmath0)-wave superconductor the resonance exist only for @xmath6 , @xmath85 correspondingly",
    ". experiments of this kind require high quality normal conducting crystal and point contacts for the electron injection .",
    "any voltage drop has to occur at the point contact for the electrons to move ballistically in the normal metal .",
    "similar procedure has been proposed from honerkamp and sigrist @xcite to discriminate between unitary and nonunitary triplet states for the superconductor sr@xmath123ruo@xmath124 .",
    "fig . [ temp.fig ] shows the tunneling conductance @xmath131 for different temperatures @xmath132 , in the large barrier strength limit @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",

    "in the ( @xmath1)-wave case the tunneling conductance has residual states within the energy gap .",
    "these are due to the formation of bound states at discreet values of the trajectory angle @xmath13 for each boundary orientation angle @xmath61 , for energies within the gap .",
    "these bound states explain both the residual states within the subgap and also the small height of the conductance within the subgap region .",
    "the calculation of the conductance @xmath104 for given boundary orientation at an incident angle @xmath13 for which bound state occurs shows an enhancement at the bound state energy .",
    "the energy dependence of the bound state on @xmath13 can be used within the method of electron focusing to detect the ( @xmath1)-wave state . in such a case besides the focusing peak another peak exists in the reflected hole distribution spectrum for all energies of the injected electrons less than the amplitude of the secondary order parameter .",
    "this peak should also be observed for the @xmath10-wave and ( @xmath0)-wave cases but only at the energy @xmath6 , @xmath85 respectively .",
    "the zero energy conductance peak decreases as @xmath142 with increasing the temperature and disappears almost at the transition temperature for the @xmath10-wave case .",

    "these features can be used to distinguish between time - reversal broken symmetry states .    throughout this paper",
    "the spatial variation of the dominant order parameter near the surface which depends on the boundary orientation is ignored for simplicity . as a consequence ,",
    "since the nucleation of the secondary order parameter near the surface depends on the strength of the dominant one , the spatial variation of the secondary order parameter is also ignored .",
    "we expect more drastic changes when the orientation is @xmath134 where the suppression of the dominant order parameter is more significant .",
    "however , since the features presented here are intrinsic and are generated by the existence of surface bound states , the essential results do not change qualitatively .",
    "also we assumed perfectly flat interfaces in the clean limit , so any impurity scattering and the effect of the surface roughness are ignored .",
    "generally surface roughness will lead to a statistical distribution of the outgoing trajectories , and will alter the results presented .",
    "the effect of surface roughness on the tunneling effect in interfaces between normal metals and superconductors with time reversal symmetry broken , has been studied.@xcite it is found that in the @xmath1 case additional bound states are formed due to the surface roughness .",
    "also in @xmath10-wave superconductor , the zep may appear even for ( @xmath152 ) interfaces with surface roughness @xcite .",
    "also in a more realistic treatment of the problem , one has to take into account also the thickness of the barrier . in that case",
    "additional resonances are expected in the tunneling spectra due to multiple andreev reflections within the barrier , besides the ones due to the bound states .",
