    "within this paper , we consider a trident snake robot moving on a planar surface .",
    "more precisely , it is a model when to each vertex of an equilateral triangle a leg of length 1 is attached that is endowed by a pair of passive wheels at its end .",
    "the joints of the legs to the triangle platform are motorised and thus the possible motion directions are determined uniquely .",
    "local controllability of such mechanism is known , see @xcite .",
    "if the generalized coordinates are considered , the non  holonomic forward kinematic equations can be understood as a pfaff system and its solution as a distribution in the configuration space .",
    "chow theorem implies that the appropriate non  holonomic system is locally controllable if the corresponding distribution is not integrable and the span of the lie algebra generated by the controlling distribution has to be of the same dimension as the configuration space .",
    "the spanned lie algebra is then naturally endowed by a filtration which shows the way to realize the motions by means of the vector field brackets @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the system is locally controllable and the filtration is @xmath0 .    in order to simplify the trident snake robot control , in section [ privcoord ]",
    "we construct a privileged system of coordinates with respect to the distribution given by local nonholonomic conditions and , furthermore , in section [ nilapprox ] we construct a nilpotent approximation of the transformed distribution with respect to the given filtration .. note that all constructions are local in the neighbourhood of 0 .    finally , we compare the motions generated by the lie brackets of the original controlling vector fields and their nilpotent approximation .",
    "the accuracy is demonstrated by simulations in matlab .",
    "we recall the following concepts of functions or vector fields orders and distribution weights , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the smooth vector fields on a manifold @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the set of germs of smooth functions at @xmath4 .",

    "the mechanism of the trident snake robot was described in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a body in the shape of an equilateral triangle with circumscribed circle of radius @xmath52 and three rigid links ( also called legs ) of constant length @xmath53 connected to the vertices of the triangular body by three motorised joints . in this paper , we consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 . to each free link end , a pair of passive wheels is attached to provide an important snake - like property that the ground friction in the direction perpendicular to the link is considerably higher than the friction of a simple forward move .",
    "in particular , this prevents slipping sideways .        to describe the actual position of a trident snake robot we need the set of 6 generalized coordinates @xmath56 as shown in figure 1 .",

    "clearly , at an arbitrary @xmath4 the desired transformation @xmath113 will be linear , in our case it will be given by @xmath119 the coordinates @xmath120 are clearly the privileged ones .",
    "we proceed according to bellaches algorithm . note that in the sequel we use the first two steps only due to the fact that in our filtration ( 3,6 ) of @xmath92 the weights at @xmath8 are 1 and 2 and thus no further modification of the coordinate system is needed , see @xcite for a detailed explanation and proof .",
    "let us consider the vector fields @xmath77 from section [ privcoord ] expressed in the privileged coordinate system @xmath120 .",
    "vector fields @xmath121 are of order @xmath27 and thus generally their taylor expansion is of the form : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a multiindex .",

    "grouping together the monomial vector fields of the same weighted degree we express @xmath130 as a series @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a homogeneous vector field of degree @xmath133 .",
    "note that this means that the @xmath134 and @xmath135 coordinate functions of @xmath136 and @xmath137 are formed by constants and the @xmath138 and @xmath139 coordinate functions are linear polynomials in @xmath140 then the following proposition holds , @xcite :    [ nilp ] set @xmath141 the family of vector fields @xmath142 is a first order approximation of @xmath143 at 0 and generates a nilpotent lie algebra of step @xmath54 , i.e. all brackets of length greater than 1 are zero .    in our case , we obtain the following vector fields : @xmath144 the family @xmath142 is the nilpotent approximation of @xmath145 at 0 associated with the coordinates @xmath146 the remaining three vector fields are generated by lie brackets of @xmath142 due to the second part of proposition [ nilp ] . note that due to linearity of the three latter coordinates of @xmath142 , the coordinates of @xmath147 must be constant .",

    "to do so we follow the structure of @xcite , yet to compare the vector fields in the same coordinate system , the inverse transformation must be applied first and the evaluation of the vector fields effects must be done consequently . note that the vector fields @xmath149 in @xmath150 coordinates",
