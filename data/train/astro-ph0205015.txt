    "extensive air showers ( eas ) [ 1 ] are produced when vhe / uhe primary photons , protons and other high z nuclei enter atmosphere from the top and produce cherenkov radiation which can be studied by imaging technique or by measuring lateral distribution .",
    "cherenkov images recorded by a tactic - like @xmath0-ray telescope represents the two dimensional distribution of cherenkov light pattern produced in the atmnosphere . in the hillas parameterization approach",
    ", image is approximated as a ellipse and parameters like image `` shape '' and `` orientation '' are calcualted .",
    "hillas paramcters like length , width miss , alpha , distance , size etc are are essentially a set of second order moments . among these parameters",
    "@xmath1  and width are known to be powerful parameters for segregation of @xmath0-ace from cosmic - ace background . using this approach ,",
    "present day telescopes have been able to reject cosmic ray background events at 98 @xmath2 level , while retaining up to 50@xmath2 of the @xmath0-ray events from a point source .",
    "hillas parameters are found to be good classifiers for small images ( close to telescope threshold energy ) but tend to fail for large images ( of higher primary energy of the order of 10 tev or higher ) as too many tail pixels are part of the image .",
    "again it is diffcult to study fainter compact sources and @xmath0-rays coming non - compact sources or of a diffusive origin . up to 50@xmath2 loss of actual image due to parameterization is also a big constraint .",
    "it is interesting to observe that various products of eas , like cherenkov photons and particle density distributions ( on the ground ) have shown multifractal features .",
    "multifractal nature of density fluctuations of particles has been experimentally verified and lipshitz - holder exponent distribution of eas has been found to be sensitive parameter to indentify the nature of individual eas [ 2 ] . we have shown that high energy @xmath0-ray simulated images of tactic [ 3 ] like @xmath0-ray telescope are multi - fractal in nature [ 4,5 ]",
    ". multifracal nature of cherenkov images have been confirmed experimentally [ 6,7 ] . because of multifractal nature of eas products , it becomes important to understand the basic multifractal process that takes place during the longitudinal passage of eas .",
    "fractals are self - similar objects which look same on many different scales of observations .",
    "fractals are defined in terms of hausdroff - bescovitch dimensions .",
    "frcatal dimensions characterize the geometric support of a structure but can not provide any information about a possible distribution or a probability that may be part of a given structure .",
    "this problem has been solved by defining an inifinite set of dimensions known as generalised dimensions which are achieved by dividing the object under study into pieces , each piece is labelled by an index i=0,1,2 .... n . if we associate a probability @xmath3 with each piece of size @xmath4 than partition function can be defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 for unique function @xmath7 it has been shown that @xmath8 for@xmath9 @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "this permits to define generalised dimension @xmath12 @xmath13 here q is a parameter which can take all values between -@xmath14 to @xmath14 .",
    "this formalism is called as multi - fractal formalism which characterizes both the geometry of a given structure and the probability measure associated with it .",
    "cherenokov images arise due to eas and have been found to be multifractal in nature . in this paper",
    "we will attempt to understand underlying process responsible for multifractal behaviour of cherenkov images .",
    "a ultra relativistic @xmath0-ray enters atmosphere from the top and interacts with air molecule to produce electron - photon cascade .",
    "the radiation length(x ) for pair production and bremsstrahlung process is equal in uhe / vhe region [ 1,10 ] .",
    "particle -photon cascade in the atmosphere is sustained alternately by electron ( @xmath15 ) -positron ( @xmath16 ) pair production and bremsstrahlung process till the average energy per particle reaches critical value @xmath17 below which energy loss process is mainly dominated by ionization process .",
    "shower development can be visualized a process in which a @xmath0-ray of energy @xmath18 (= 1 tev ( say ) ) after traveling distance x ( on average ) produces electron - positron pair each having energy @xmath19 .",
    "since energy is getting divided into two equal parts , we can attribute a resolution of energy e = @xmath20 . in the next radiation length",
    "both electron and positron lose half of their energy ( on average ) and each radiates one photon .",
    "thus in this radiation length there are two photons and two particles ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) each having energy @xmath23 which can be attributed to energy resolution e= @xmath24 . at this stage fraction of photons",
    "( @xmath25 = @xmath26 ) is same as fraction of particles ( @xmath27= @xmath26 ) . as the shower develops into next radiation length",
    "both electron and positron lose half of their energy and produce one photon each . at the same time",
    "two photons produced in the previous radiation length interact with air molecule to produce electron ( @xmath15 ) -positron ( @xmath16 ) pair . thus in third radiation length",
    "there are two photons and six particles each having energy @xmath28 .",
    "this stage can be attributed to the energy resolution e=@xmath29 .",
    "it is important to note that , at this stage the process of equal division in energy between each photon and each particle continues but the process of unequal measure between photons and particles begins . in this radiation length",
    "the fraction of photons is @xmath25=@xmath30 and fraction of particles ( electron + positrons ) is @xmath27=@xmath31 .",
    "the fourth radiation length corresponds to energy resolution e=@xmath32 as total of 16 photons and particles are produced each having energy @xmath33 . however , there are 10 charged particles ( 5 positrons + 5 electrons ) and 6 photons , a case of unequal energy division and unequal fraction .    at a distance of nx ,",
    "the total number of particles and photons is @xmath34 , each having average energy @xmath35 and on an average shower consists of fraction of @xmath31 particles and @xmath30 photons even at nth stage .",
    "this corresponds to energy resolution of e=@xmath36 . at nth stage",
    "each particle or photon can be labelled sequentially with i=0,1,2 , ..... the probability or fraction of particles and photons can be written as @xmath37=@xmath38 .",
    "the partition function for finite energy can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of particles and photons .",
    "for the simplicity of calculations , we assume that incoming energy e is equal to unit energy .",
    "this will not make any difference to actual results but integrate it with other classical examples of multifractal behaviour , e.g. curdling of cantor set [ 9 ] . on the average shower development process",
    "has a recursive structure similar to cantor set [ 9 ] because both processes are inherently binomial multiplicative in nature . for @xmath41=@xmath7,we",
    "have @xmath42 in the limit of e @xmath43 0 , the most dominant contribution to this partition function will survive when @xmath41=@xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the solution of the equation @xmath44 above equation can be easily solved to get @xmath7 .",
    "in each radiation length the measure of photons and particles fluctuates but on the average the shower consists of @xmath31 positrons and electrons and @xmath30 photons . in the present case",
    "e= @xmath26 , @xmath25= @xmath30 , @xmath27=@xmath31 . using above equation and stirling approximation",
    ", we have @xmath45 for q=0 , @xmath46 gives fractal dimension .",
    "for q=1 , @xmath47 is the information dimension which encodes the entropy scaling and q=2 , @xmath48 is the correlation dimension which measures scaling of two point density correlation .",
    "apart from @xmath46,@xmath47 , @xmath48 there are infinite set of other exponents from which information can be obtained by constructing an equivalent picture of the system in terms of scaling indices @xmath1 for the probability measure defined on a support of fractal dimension f(@xmath1 ) .",
    "f(@xmath1(q ) ) is the fractal dimension of the set . in case",
    "all @xmath12 s are equal to fractal dimensions @xmath46 than f(@xmath1(q ) ) collapses to a point f= @xmath1 = @xmath46 , indicating that scaling behaviour of a fractal measure is of single type .",
    "this is situation which involves neither probability variation nor length variation .",
    "it is possible that as the shower develops deep into atmosphere , division of energy may not remain equal . with the possibility of @xmath49 and/or @xmath50 and @xmath51 shower development process can still be described as a multifractal process because either the energy or the probability or both need to be different for a multifractal process .",
    "the partition function for this case can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53=e and @xmath54 = p. above equation can be numerically solved for @xmath7 if values of @xmath55,@xmath56,@xmath25 and @xmath27 are known and fixed for each radiation length .",
    "as the shower develops deep into atmosphere most realistic situation is that there will be energy loss in all radiation lengths .",
    "so a generalized scenario can be described in which @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the condition @xmath57 e in each radiation length . each shower is unique because shower development process is random and there are no unique values of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "variation in the muon ( 4-layer ) rate over , scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "any simulation / experimental arrangement to measure eas will consist of set of detectors which can measure only a sample or fraction of eas products .",
    "this sample may consist of distribution of charged particles / photons .",
    "the set of detectors which measure this distribution represents a geometric support and multifractal measures can be related to this geometric support .",
    "this can be done by calculating multifractal moments of this distribution and obtain generalized dimensions from scaling properties of multifractal moments .",
    "the definitions of multifractal properties given in previous section are not defined with respect to any support and hence can not be applied directly to simulated / experimental data .",
    "simulated cherenkov images were generated for @xmath0-rays and protons using corsika code for tactic configuration [ 4,5 and references therein ] .",
    "@xmath0-rays of energy 50 tev and protons of energy 100 tev are considered for multifractal studies .",
    "each simulated image is divided into m= @xmath58 where @xmath59=2,4,6,8 , is the scale .",
    "the multifractal moments are @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of photoelectrons in the kth cell and n is the total number of photoelectrons in whole image .",
    "@xmath62 shows a power law behaviour with m , i.e. @xmath63 where @xmath7 is related to generalized multifractal dimension by @xmath64 we have calculated average values of @xmath12 for 1000 images each for @xmath0-rays and protons .",
    "we have repeated above studies for 30 tev @xmath0-rays and 60 tev protons .",
    "no energy dependence of @xmath12 on q was observed .",
    "variation in the muon ( 4-layer ) rate over , scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "as the shower develops deep into the atmosphere , values of @xmath55,@xmath56,@xmath25 and @xmath27 in various radiation lengths may not remain fixed but may fluctuate .",
    "it is not possible to solve equation ( 4 ) for all fluctuating values in each radiation length .",
    "hence we have to take average values .",
    "figure 1 depicts @xmath12 dependence on q for various average values .",
    "continuous curve has been obtained in figure 1 for the case @xmath55=@xmath56=@xmath26 , @xmath25=@xmath30 and @xmath27=@xmath31 .",
    "simulated data corresponding to protons is represented by ( + ) sign and simulated data corresponding to @xmath0-rays is represented by ( x ) sign .",
    "@xmath12 values of each cherenkov image corresponding to @xmath0-rays and protons were calculated for 1000 images and average was computed . in figure 1 , these average values of @xmath12 for both protons and @xmath65-rays have been shown .",
    "it is clear from figure that theoretically known average values of shower progression does not match with average values of simulated results .",
    "figure 2 shows average values of @xmath12 versus q behaviour for five different cases .",
    "curve a is actually part ( of continuous curve ) of figure 1 , shown here for the purpose of comparison .",
    "average values of @xmath12 corresponding to proton ( + sign shown as curve d ) and @xmath0-rays ( x sign shown as curve e ) have been replotted .",
    "the continuous corresponding to b and c have been obtained .",
    "curve b corresponds to @xmath55=@xmath66 , @xmath56=@xmath67 , @xmath25=@xmath68 and @xmath27=@xmath69 .",
    "curves b correspond to 23 @xmath2 loss of energy in proton initiated showers in all radiation lengths on the average and curve c corresponds to average loss of 18 @xmath2 energy in all radiation lengths by @xmath0-ray initiated shower .",
    "curve a corresponds to case of no energy loss .",
    "it is clear that theoretical model of shower development considered with average loss of energy in each radiation length is a good approximation of showers .",
    "in this paper we have theoritically calculated generalized dimension @xmath12 of shower development process based on simple model for the case of average values of energy energy and probability .",
    "we have considered the case of no loss of energy and average loss of energy per radiation length in the shower development process .",
    "we have also simulated cherenkov images corresponding to @xmath0-rays and proton initiated showers .",
    "average values of @xmath12 have been calculated for both types of images .",
    "comparison of average theoritical values and average simulated values are given in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "it is clear that theoritical model of shower development considered with average loss of energy in each radiation length in this paper is good approximation for showers .",
    "it is interesting to observe that initiated eas progression comes close to the mathematical definition of classic cantor set .",
    "curves b and c in figure 2 , represent two scale fractal measure of cantor set in which a fraction of energy at each stage gets removed .",
    "such processes have been discussed [ 15 ] in detail [ page 86 ] .",
    "the identification of eas model as a multifractal process is actually experiencing a cantor process or cantor dust in actual physical world .    in eas process",
    "there is division of energies in terms of charged particles and photons as the appearences of charged particles , in any radiation length , means production of cherenkov radiation and appearence of photons in any radiation length means absence of cherenkov radiation .",
    "the cherenkov image formed on telescope is actually superimposition of cherekov photons produced at different heights .",
    "multifractal measures are associated the distribution of data on a geometric support",
    ". this support may be ordinary plane surface , photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) camera or a fractal itself .    for particle detection",
    ", it has been shown by kempa[13 ] that multifractal structures of density fluctuations of charged particles near eas can be used to distinguish between @xmath0-ray and hadron content of cosmic ray .",
    "the method of multifractal moment analysis has been applied to simulated data as observed by kaskade experiment to distinguish eas lateral distributions due to various types of primaries [ 12 ] .",
    "the fractal moments are part of the sample of observables used for kaskade data anlysis [ 13 ] .",
    "another important point that is clear from this studies is that so called a toy model of eas can match detailed simulated corsika results just by introducing a small loss term in each radiation lenght",
    ".    the different values of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 fitted in figure 2 are not unique values .",
    "many other combinations of energies and probabilites will produce same resutls .",
    "it is because eas process is random in nature and all combinations of different values of energies and probabilites are equally and uniquely probable .",
    "it is important to note that there can not be any unique values ascribed to energies and probabilites in eas .",
