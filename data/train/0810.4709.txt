    "@xcite have produced rb@xmath5 molecules in the lowest rovibrational level of the lowest triplet state .",
    "there have also been considerable successes in direct photoassociation to produce low - lying states @xcite .",
    "a major goal of the experimental work is to produce a stable molecular quantum gas .",
    "however , such a gas can form only if ( i ) a large number of molecules are in the same hyperfine state and ( ii ) the molecules are stable to collisions that occur in the gas . in particular , inelastic collisions that transfer internal energy into relative translational energy cause heating and/or trap loss .",
    "it is thus very important to understand the hyperfine structure of the low - lying levels and its dependence on applied electric and magnetic fields . in a previous paper",
    ", we explored the hyperfine levels of heteronuclear alkali metal dimers in rotationless levels @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend this work to homonuclear molecules , which have important special features .",
    "we also explore @xmath0 levels , which may be collisionally stable for homonuclear molecules and which interact with longer - range forces than @xmath6 levels .",
    "the hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule in the presence of an external magnetic field can be decomposed into five different contributions : the electronic , vibrational , rotational , hyperfine and zeeman terms . for @xmath7 molecules in a fixed vibrational level , the first two terms take a constant value and the rotational , hyperfine and zeeman parts of the hamiltonian may be written @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 where the index @xmath10 refers to each of the nuclei in the molecule .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the operators for mechanical rotation and for the spins of nuclei 1 and 2 .",
    "the rotational and centrifugal constants of the molecule are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( but centrifugal distortion is neglected in the present work ) .",
    "we use @xmath11 rather than @xmath16 for mechanical rotation because we wish to reserve @xmath16 for the angular momentum including electron spin for future work on triplet states .",
    "the hyperfine hamiltonian of equation [ eq : hhf ] consists of four different contributions .",
    "the first is the electric quadrupole interaction @xmath17 , with coupling constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it represents the interaction of the nuclear quadrupoles ( @xmath20 ) with the electric field gradients @xmath21 created by the electrons at the nuclear positions .",
    "the second is the spin - rotation term @xmath22 , which describes the interaction of the nuclear magnetic moments with the magnetic moment created by the rotation of the molecule .",
    "its coupling constants are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for a homonuclear molecule with identical nuclei , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the last two terms represent the interaction between the two nuclear spins ; there is both a tensor component @xmath27 , with coupling constant @xmath28 , and a scalar component @xmath29 , with coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "the second - rank tensor @xmath31 represents the angular part of a dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the zeeman hamiltonian @xmath32 has both rotational and nuclear zeeman contributions characterized by @xmath33-factors @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for homonuclear molecules @xmath37 .",
    "the nuclear shielding tensor @xmath38 is approximated here by its isotropic part @xmath39 ; terms involving the anisotropy of @xmath38 are extremely small for the states considered here .    the nuclear @xmath33-factors and the quadrupole moments of the nuclei are experimentally known @xcite .    for homonuclear molecules we neglect the effect of electric fields , though in principle there are small effects due to anisotropic polarizabilities and the molecular quadrupole moments can interact with the gradients of inhomogeneous fields .",
    "the rotational @xmath33-factors are known experimentally for all the homonuclear alkali metal dimers @xcite .",
    "however , the only such species for which the nuclear hyperfine coupling constants have been determined accurately is na@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we have therefore evaluated the remaining coupling constants using density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations performed with the amsterdam density functional ( adf ) package @xcite with all - electron basis sets and including relativistic corrections .",
    "a full description of the basis sets , functionals , etc .  used in the calculations has been given in our previous paper on heteronuclear systems @xcite .",
    "in the present work , the calculations were carried out at the equilibrium geometries ( @xmath40   for li@xmath5 @xcite , 3.08   for na@xmath41 @xcite , 3.92   for k@xmath5 @xcite , 4.21   for rb@xmath5 @xcite and 4.65   for cs@xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "this give results that are approximately valid not only for @xmath42 states but also for other low - lying vibrational states .",
    "the values for the coupling constants are given in table [ tb : hd ] .",
    "it may be seen that the dft results for na@xmath5 are within about 30% of the experimental values , and similar accuracy was obtained for other test cases in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the accuracy is likely to be comparable for the other cases studied here .",
    "this level of accuracy is adequate for the purpose of the present paper , which aims to explore the qualitative nature of the zeeman patterns .",

    "equation [ eq : hiz1 ] shows that the matrix representation of the nuclear zeeman term in the spin - coupled basis is diagonal with nonzero elements proportional to @xmath76 and independent of any other quantum number .",
    "as the magnetic field increases the nuclear zeeman terms becomes dominant and the slope of the energy levels is determined by @xmath76 .",
    "the results in figure [ fig:04 ] neglect the diamagnetic zeeman interaction , which is not completely negligible at the highest fields considered ( up to 4000 g ) .",

    "the first term has a value around 200 khz at 4000 g for @xmath55rb@xmath5 .",
    "although this quantity is not negligible , it has not been included because it simply shifts all the energy levels by the same amount and has no effect on splittings .",
    "the second term is diagonal in the spin - coupled basis set and its nonzero elements depend on @xmath4 and @xmath88 . for @xmath55rb@xmath5 at 4000 g it would shift the energy levels by about 15 khz .",
    "it is therefore very small compared to the nuclear zeeman effect .",

    "we have calculated the nuclear hyperfine coupling constants for all common isotopic species of the homonuclear dimers from li@xmath5 to cs@xmath5 and explored the energy level patterns in detail for @xmath55rb@xmath5 and @xmath56rb@xmath5 .    for rotationless molecules ( @xmath6 states ) ,",
