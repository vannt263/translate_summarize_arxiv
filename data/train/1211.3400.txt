    "the x - ray transient xte  j0421 + 560 was discovered by the all - sky monitor on - board rxte during a strong outburst in 1998 by @xcite it brightened to a peak flux of @xmath52 crab within a few hours before rapidly decaying , reaching quiescence in under two weeks .",
    "observations at different wavelengths immediately after the outburst revealed similar behaviour in the optical and radio bands with a peak flux density of almost 1  jy at 8.30  ghz ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "initial radio observations suggested that there might be a superluminal expansion @xcite , but subsequent analysis showed that the radio emitting region was expanding with a velocity of only @xmath512,000  km  s@xmath6 @xcite .",

    "the optical counterpart of xte  j0421 + 560 is ci camelopardalis ( ci cam ) , a b0 - 2 supergiant b[e ] star as classified by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , establishing this system as a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "common properties of stars exhibiting the b[e ] phenomenon are the presence of forbidden emission lines in their optical spectra and a strong infra - red ( ir ) excess .",
    "this ir excess is attributed to a hot circumstellar dust shell @xcite . until the launch of _ integral _ ci  cam was the only known sgb[e ] companion star in a hmxb .",
    "_ integral _ has since identified another sgb[e]/xrb candidate , igr  j16318 - 4848 @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar gaseous environment of ci cam has been under much scrutiny since the 1998 outburst .",
    "@xcite propose a two - component wind from the sgb[e ] star to explain their observations ; a cool , low velocity `` iron '' wind and a hot , high velocity wind .",
    "the low velocity wind is dense , roughly spherical and extends to a radius of 13 to 50  au .",
    "they note it is unclear as to how these winds with very different densities and velocities co - exist . following a series of spectroscopic observations,@xcite",
    "also conclude that the emission lines must originate from several physically separate regions . unlike @xcite , they associate the h balmer lines , he  i and fe  ii lines with the same region ; a disk , or equatorial outflow region , viewed nearly pole on .",
    "this is consistent with the two component stellar wind model for supergiant b[e ] stars proposed by @xcite .",
    "analysis of high resolution optical spectra by @xcite , observed almost 3 years after the outburst , revealed clearly resolved emission line profiles , displaying a triple peak structure .",
    "they suggest that this implies an intermediate inclination angle of the circumstellar disk with respect to the line of sight .",
    "recent interferometric work in the near infrared over an eight year period from the outburst by @xcite resolves the emitting region .",
    "they model this as a skewed elliptical gaussian ring with semi - major axis @xmath7  au ( assuming a distance of 5  kpc ) with an inclination angle of @xmath8 .",

    "the proposed period would put the semi - major axis of the binary orbit between 100 - 130  @xmath10 : close to the surface of the star ( based on mass and radii measurements of sgb[e ] stars by @xcite )",
    ".    unfortunately , distance estimates to xte  j0421 + 560 are uncertain with a wide range of values being adopted in the literature .",
    "this is primarily due to the lack of reliable spectral diagnostics available to determine the the luminosity class of the mass donor .",
    "consequently , estimates range from 1 - 17  kpc .",
    "this in turn means that the x - ray luminosity of the outburst is not well constrained and as a result the nature of the compact object of this binary system is still unclear .",

    "the continuum of the spectrum was first fit by excluding the data around the iron line region .",
    "the absorption was modeled with two elements , a galactic foreground component , @xmath12 fixed to @xmath13  @xmath2 @xcite and a separate column density , @xmath14 , intrinsic to the source which was allowed to vary . a simple absorbed power - law model ( _ phabs*phabs*powerlaw _ in ) yielded a respectable fit with a @xmath15 value of 135.6 for 128 degrees of freedom ( dof ; @xmath16 ) .",
    "a partially covered power law model was also fit to the data ( _ phabs*pcfabs*powerlaw _ in ) . in this model",
    "the underlying powerlaw is fractionally covered by an absorbing material with the uncovered emission absorbed by the interstellar medium .",

    "the fe - k@xmath3 line spans a much narrower range of energies than the continuum light curves .",

    "the solid black lines are the same ccfs , smoothed using a moving average method in an attempt to minimise the noise .",
    "a positive time delay corresponds to a lag in the variation of the light curve with reference to the continua .",
    "the fe - k@xmath3 ccf appears to be more asymmetric than its continuum counterparts .",
    "more explicitly , the minimum present in the continua ccfs around @xmath510  ks does not seem to be present .        whilst the energy range of the fe - k@xmath3 line has been deliberately defined to keep continuum contamination at a minimum",
    ", inevitably there will be some contamination as there is no way to separate the line emission from the continuum emission at these energies . as such we expect to see some correlation of the light curves at zero lag . however , an asymmetry in the ccf is often interpreted as evidence for a lag ( e.g. @xcite ) and so we explore the possibility that the shape of the ccf could be due a transfer function which includes some power at positive lags .",
    "we define the `` asymmetry factor '' , @xmath57 , of the ccfs to be the ratio of the difference of the half widths of the peak at tenth maximum , to the sum of the half widths .",
    "this gives a number between -1 and 1 , with zero being perfectly symmetrical .",
    "a positive value of @xmath57 indicates that the gradient of the peak is steeper on the negative lag side and vice versa for a negative value .",

    "however , the @xmath57 value for the fe - k@xmath3 ccf is 0.39 , indicating a moderate level of asymmetry .",
    "the method of @xcite was then used to see if the asymmetry seen in our fe - k@xmath3 ccf could be caused by poisson noise .",
    "monte - carlo simulations were performed to assess the significance of this asymmetry .",
    "ten thousand red - noise light curves were generated with a power law slope of -2.0 using the method of @xcite and the idl routine .",
    "the light curves were initially simulated with a duration ten times longer than that of the actual data and were then cut down to the observed duration to account for red - noise leakage .",
    "the simulated light curve was then used to create four light curves with the statistical properties of the observed light curves , resulting in four identical light curves distinguishable only by their mean and standard deviation .",
    "noise was then added to each data point of the simulated light curves by adding a gaussian deviation with a mean of zero and a variance equal to that of the corresponding data point in the real light curve ( similar to the method of @xcite ) .",
    "any negative data points were then set to zero .",
    "the three continuum light curves were then combined and cross - correlated with the fake fe - k@xmath3 line light curve in the exact same manner as the observed data . the asymmetry factor and peak value of the smoothed ccfs",
    "were then calculated .",

    "as such , the x - ray emission from the source does appear to have shown a moderate level of variability over the last few years .",
    "the improved signal to noise has allowed the apparently broad gaussian , reported by @xcite , to be decomposed into three intrinsically narrow components , neutral fe - k@xmath3 and k@xmath4 and helium like fexxv k@xmath3 .",
    "it is unclear how both neutral and almost fully ionised iron can co - exist and only seems possible if the ionised line emission arises from a physically separate region from the neutral emission , possibly local to the compact object .",

    "a more in depth description along with the fundamental principles and assumptions of reverberation mapping is given by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this is a small fraction of the semi - major axis of the torus and so the approximation that the compact object is at the centre of torus seems valid .",
    "however , in reality the neutral iron is unlikely to be located in an infinitesimally thin ring in the torus , it seems more likely that there exists an inner radius at which neutral iron can form . in this case",
    "a lag would also have a more complex density dependence than the one that is considered here .",
    "both these factors will serve to broaden the peak seen at @xmath79 , and so the derived radius is likely the radius where the neutral iron density is at a maximum .",
    "a significant obstacle to understanding the nature and behaviour of ci cam is the uncertainty in the distance , with estimates ranging from @xmath83  kpc @xcite to > 10  kpc @xcite . the consequential uncertainty in the luminosity impacts on the nature of both the mass donor and the accretor , with the former authors favouring a b4iii - v + white dwarf model and the latter a sgb[e ] star + relativistic accretor ( neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "in support of the former interpretation , @xcite infer the presence of a white dwarf from analysis of the _ asca _ x - ray spectrum .",
    "this was fit with an optically thin , thermal hard x - ray model , characteristic of cataclysmic variables which contain a white dwarf .",
    "our analysis ( section 3 ) clearly favours the power law model , with similar parameters to those reported for the other known sgb[e ] hmxb , igr  j16318 - 4848 @xcite , which @xcite claim hosts a neutron star based on the ratio of the x - ray and radio flux ( though they note that the unique environment means they are cautious about applying such a relationship ) .",
    "the photon index reported is also consistent with those found in neutron star be / x - ray binaries by @xcite ( 0.6 - 1.4 ; 2008 ) .",
    "to date only two other supergiant b[e ] stars have been detected as x - ray sources ; the hmxb igr  j16318 - 4848 ( e.g. @xcite ) and the cluster member wd1 - 9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "igr j16318 - 4848 shows a striking similarity to ci  cam , with a quiescent x - ray spectra best fitted with an absorbed , truncated power law and a strong fe - k@xmath3 line .",
    "there is no evidence for the ionised iron line in the higher resolution _ suzaku _ data of igr  j1631 - 4848 @xcite suggesting that this could be unique to ci  cam .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of wd1 - 9 instead demonstrates a spectrum consistent with emission from an optically thin thermal plasma ( @xmath84kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is suggestive of emission from a colliding wind binary rather an accreting binary , consequently we do not discuss this source further .",
    "uncertainties in the distances to both ci cam and igr j16318 - 4848 mean that it is difficult to compare quiescent luminosities , but our results suggest that they appear broadly comparable ( to within a factor of a few ) under the assumption that ci cam is located at @xmath55  kpc and igr j16318 - 4848 is within the 1.6 - 4  kpc range favoured by @xcite ( @xcite , sect .",
    "3 ) implying that the quiescent fluxes in both ci cam and igr j16318 - 4848 arise via a similar mechanism .",
    "both sources have undergone x - ray `` flares '' with current temporal sampling suggesting that these events are rare and aperiodic ; only two flares separated by @xmath85  yrs have been associated with igr j16318 - 4848 ( 1994 and 2003 ; @xcite ) and just the one event in 1998 with ci cam ( noting that photometric observations between 1989 - 92 also show no evidence for flaring in this period ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the peak luminosity also differs between the systems ; with @xcite suggesting @xmath86ergs  s@xmath6 for igr  j163818 - 4848 ( assuming a distance of 4 kpc ) compared to @xmath87ergs  s@xmath6 for ci cam ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "both ci cam and igr j16318 - 4848 appear to be rather luminous supergiants , with comparable bolometric luminosities .",
    "both sources also support a mid - ir excess attributed to circumstellar gas .",
    "although different modeling assumptions ( optically thin / thick emission , spherical or disc geometry and composition ) make direct comparison of the physical properties ( e.g. inner radius , dust mass ) of the dusty components difficult .",
    "the dust temperature at the inner radius of the envelope appears rather high in both cases ( @xmath88k for igr j16318 - 4848 @xcite and @xmath89k for ci cam @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry of the dusty envelope has been unambiguously determined for ci cam by @xcite , who showed that it resides in a ring or torus with inner radius @xmath90  au ( at 5  kpc ) .",
    "no conclusions as to the dust geometry in igr j16318 - 4848 were drawn by @xcite , although by analogy to other b[e ] stars @xcite adopt a disc like geometry with inner radius @xmath91  au / kpc .",
    "if the @xmath519.3  day orbital period @xcite propose for ci cam is confirmed , the binary would also lie interior to the dusty disc mapped by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately no orbital period is known for igr j16318 - 4848 .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the spectral and timing properties of xte  j0421 + 560/ci  cam .",
    "the continuum of the spectrum is well described by a heavily absorbed ( @xmath92 power law with photon index consistent with those seen in neutron star be / x - ray binaries ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we also attempted to fit the white dwarf model of @xcite but could not achieve an acceptable fit or sensible model parameters .",
    "the apparently broad iron line has been decomposed into three , intrinsically narrow lines , neutral fe - k@xmath3 and k@xmath4 and almost completely ionised fexxv k@xmath3 , suggesting multiple emitting regions .",
    "the quiescent spectrum seems to point to a neutron star or black hole accretor , however this is inconsistent with the x - ray activity of the system and we can not suggest a mechanism for the large x - ray flare seen in 1998 .",
    "further observations of xte  j0421 + 560/ci  cam of increased duration are required to confirm or refute the presence of the lag suggested in this paper .",
    "better quality data could be used to solve the transfer equation and could be used to explore the possibility of a lag between the neutral and ionised fe - k@xmath3 emission , both of which are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "better constraints on other system parameters , such as distance , inclination and system mass , would also help to constrain the geometry of this unusual system using this method ."
