    "the results of theoretical and experimental study of free convective flows from heating objects are widely published and they are very useful to determine convective heat losses from apparatus , devices , pipes in industrial or energetic installations , electronic equipment , architectonic objects and so on by engineers and designers .    the problem of convective flow development traditionally is based either on boundary layer theory or on self - similarity theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . both methods of natural convection heat transfer description use simplifications that allow to transform the basic fundamental equations of navier - stokes , mass and fourier - kirchhoff  equations . as a main point of the methods is an ordinary differential equation introduction which solution relates to a general problem by some contraction procedure . such description",
    "do nt give a possibility to investigate some details of a flow field for example at vicinity of its starting point .",
    "it is known that the starting point influence is important in many aspects of fluid flow development , especially in critical conditions .",
    "there are some problems of convection for which the boundary layer approach fails .",
    "one of such cases is an assumption that boundary layer starts on a plate , that contradicts experiment .",
    "the other is conceptual for the theory : the fluid flow is restricted by a conditional boundary which also do nt exist in reality . due to",
    "this prandtl introduced integration across a boundary layer to determine average values of fluid flow ( velocity , temperature ) .",
    "the similarity solution method is based on a specific combination of independent variables introduction that allows to get rid of two - dimensionality of the general problem .",
    "the resulting ordinary differential equation gives an information of velocity and temperature profiles that is an advance in comparison with boundary layer theory .",
    "however such description still is rather qualitative than quantitative .",
    "for example it does nt give an answer about flow behavior in the vicinity of the starting point in the flow .",

    "we consider approximate analytical solution of stationary convective fluid flow induced by an isothermal vertical surface with the axis @xmath0 parallel to gravity force @xmath1 is used as a horizontal one .",
    "the choice of the coordinate system is typical for laminar natural convection simplifications with the following main assumptions : fluid is incompressible , boussinesq approximation , normal to the surface component of velocity is neglected @xcite . the case of isothermal vertical surface",
    "is obtained as a limit of horizontal conic with a base angle of the conic @xmath2 @xcite    our solutions are build without use neither of boundary layer nor self - similarity concepts .",
    "we are looking for the solution as taylor series in @xmath1 and derive a system of equations for coefficient of the expansion .",
    "each cutting of the series results in polynomial approximation in @xmath1 and find a closed system of equations in @xmath0 .",
    "we restrict ourselves by upper half plane ( @xmath3 .",
    "such approach needs a formulation of boundary conditions in the starting point of the flow .",
    "we take into account the physical character of the flow : namely its natural convection origin that means average velocity is zero at @xmath4 level . for the formulation of boundary conditions we base on conservation laws in integral form .",
    "let us consider a two dimensional stationary flow of incompressible fluid in the gravity field .",
    "the flow is generated by a convective heat transfer from solid plate to the fluid .",
    "the plate is isothermal and vertical . in the cartesian",
    "coordinates @xmath5 the navier - stokes ( ns ) system of equations have the form @xcite : @xmath6 @xmath7 in the above equations the pressure terms are divided in two parts @xmath8 .",
    "the first of them is the hydrostatic one that is equal to mass force @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the density of  a liquid at the nondisturbed area where the temperature is @xmath11 .",
    "the second one is the extra pressure denoted by @xmath12the part of gravity force @xmath13 arises from dependence of the extra density on temperature , @xmath14 is a coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid . in the case of gases",

    "next aim of this paper is the theory application to the standard example of a finite vertical plate . in this case",
    "we assume the angle between the plate and a stream line is small that means a possibility to neglect the horizontal component of velocity of fluid , denoting the vertical component as @xmath46 .",
    "it means that the number of equations : ( @xmath47 ) , ( @xmath48 ) , ( @xmath49 ) exceeds the number of variables : @xmath22 and @xmath50 , hence one of the equations should be excluded . having in mind mass conservation account in integral form , we exclude the equation ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "as it will be clear from further analysis we should consider the functions : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 as variables of the first order , while @xmath62 and @xmath63 to be the second one . from the relations that appear after substitution of ( @xmath64 and ( @xmath65 into ( @xmath66 and ( @xmath67 it follows that @xmath68    substituting expressions ( @xmath64 and ( @xmath65 into the equations ( @xmath67 and ( @xmath69 taking into account the assumption that @xmath70 and @xmath71 yields @xmath72   = 0 , \\label{ns - a}\\ ] ] @xmath73 from ( @xmath74 one found that @xmath75 and @xmath76 finally from both equations ( @xmath77 ( @xmath74 we obtain the system of equations for the coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 the first two ( @xmath85 ( @xmath86 arise from fk equation and the rest of them are from the ns one .",
    "the system of equations is closed if @xmath87 .",
    "it means that the number of equations and the number of unknown functions is the same .",
    "finally , in the first approximation the velocity and temperature are expressed as : @xmath88 from ( @xmath89 ) one has @xmath90 from ( @xmath91 ) it follows that @xmath92hence ( @xmath93 ) goes to:@xmath94 @xmath95 the equation ( @xmath96 ) reads :    @xmath97    the equation ( @xmath98 is the ordinary differential equation of the fourth order , therefore its solution needs four constants of integration , denoted as : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 these constants depend on two parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which enter the coefficients of the eq.@xmath105 .",

    "it means that we have six constants determining the solution of problem and we need also six corresponding boundary conditions at @xmath108",
    "at the starting horizontal edge of the vertical plate the bouncy force yet does not act therefore we assume that the mean vertical component of the velocity is negligibly small .",
    "thus we neglect a fine velocity structure of transition area .",
    "similar the temperature values are averaged in the vicinity of the boundary edge point and taken as value -1 ( temperature of incoming from the bottom flow ) .",
