    "the presence and slow growth of earth s inner core is one of the most significant manifestations of the dynamics in the interior of our planet .",
    "as it is inaccessible to direct observation , an understanding of the physical state of the inner core requires an integrative approach combining results from many fields in the geosciences .",
    "seismology , geo- and paleomagnetism , geo- and cosmochemistry , geodynamics , and mineral physics have advanced our knowledge of the structure and processes in the inner core , revealing many surprises .",
    "foremost among these have been the discoveries of anisotropy and heterogeneity in the inner core .",
    "long assumed to be a featureless spherically symmetric body , a higher number and higher quality of seismic data revealed that the inner core is strongly anisotropic to compressional wave propagation [ _ morelli et al . , 1986 ; woodhouse et al . , 1986 _ ] .",
    "generally , seismic waves travel faster along paths parallel to the earth s polar axis by 3 - 4% compared to equatorial ray paths [ _ creager , 1992 ; song and helmberger , 1993 _ ] .",
    "the presence of anisotropy is significant because it promises to reveal dynamical processes within the inner core .",
    "anisotropy is usually attributed to lattice preferred orientation , which may develop during inner core growth [ _ karato , 1993 ; bergman , 1997 _ ] , or by solid state deformation [ _ buffett , 2000 _ ] .",
    "the source of stress that may be responsible for deformation of the inner core is unknown , although several mechanisms have been proposed [ _ jeanloz and wenk , 1988 ; yoshida et al . , 1996 ; buffett 1996 ; 1997 ; karato , 1999 ; buffett and bloxham 2000 _ ] .",
    "an understanding of the origin of inner core anisotropy will require further advances in our knowledge of the physical properties of iron at inner core conditions , and may rely critically on further observations of the detailed structure of the inner core .",
    "for example , recent observations indicate that the magnitude of the anisotropy may vary with position : heterogeneity has been observed on length scales from 1 - 1000 km [ _ creager , 1997 ; tanaka and hamaguchi , 1997 ; vidale and earle , 2000 _ ] .",
    "inner core structure may change with time as well . _",
    "song and richards _ [ 1996 ] interpreted apparent changes in travel times of inner core sensitive phases in terms of super - rotation of the inner core with respect to the mantle .",
    "some recent studies have argued for a much slower rotation rate than that advocated originally , or questioned the interpretation of time dependent structure [ _ souriau , 1998 ; laske and masters , 1999 ; vidale and earle , 2000 _ ] .",
    "the inner core also plays an essential role in the dynamics of the overlying outer core .",
    "the anisotropy and long magnetic diffusion time of the inner core may alter the frequency and nature of reversals , and influence the form of the time - averaged field [ _ hollerbach and jones , 1993 ; clement and stixrude , 1995 _ ] .",
    "moreover , important energy sources driving the geodynamo process are associated with solidification of the inner core : the density contrast across the inner core boundary is due to the phase transition from the liquid to the solid , and chemical differentiation during theincongruent freezing of the inner core . both of these processes provide energy for the dynamo through the release of latent heat [ _ verhoogen , 1961 _ ] and the generation of chemical buoyancy [ _ braginsky , 1963 _ ] .",
    "other energy sources for magnetic field generation are secular cooling of the earth , gravitational energy from thermal contraction of the core , radioactive heat generation , and precession [ _ verhoogen , 1980 ; buffett et al . , 1996 _ ] .",
    "both thermal and compositional contributions to the buoyancy depend on the thermal state of the core .",
    "the more viscous mantle controls the cooling time scale of the earth and facilitates the formation of a thermal boundary layer at the core mantle boundary .",
    "the heat flux out of the core controls the rate of inner core growth and light element partitioning during this process [ _ buffett et al .",
    ", 1996 _ ] .",
    "conversely , a reliable estimate on temperature in the earth s core would advance our understanding of the current thermal state and evolution of the earth [ _ jeanloz and morris , 1986 ; yukutake , 2000 _ ] with important implications for the dynamics of the earth .    because the inner core is inaccessible",
    ", the study of model systems by theory and experiments is essential .",
    "here we consider the ways in which mineral physics may lend deeper insight into inner core processes and to the origin of its structure , extending previous reviews by _ jeanloz _",
    "[ 1990 ] and _ stixrude and brown _ [ 1998 ] .",
    "we begin with geophysical background on the inner core including recent seismological advances , constraints on the composition , thermal state , and dynamics of the inner core .",
    "as our subsequent discussions draw on various experimental and theoretical approaches in mineral physics we then give an overview of recent developments in methods in the following section , focusing on computational mineral physics ( a recent review focusing on advances in experiments has been given by _",
    "hemley and mao _ [ 2001 ] ) . to the extent that the inner core is composed of nearly pure iron , physical properties of this element at high pressure and temperature",
    "govern the behavior of the inner core ; we consequently review advances in our knowledge of the high pressure physical properties of iron , focusing on crystalline structure , equation of state , and elasticity at both static condition and high temperature . in the final section",
    "we examine the implications of these results for inner core temperature , and integrate aspects of elasticity with considerations of the dynamics in the inner core to develop a simple speculative model of polycrystalline structure that explains major aspects of its anisotropy .",
    "_ lehmann _ [ 1936 ] discovered the inner core by recognizing weak arrivals of pkikp within the p - wave shadow zone of the core .",
    "the amplitudes of these arrivals were sufficient to invoke a discontinuous seismic boundary in the earth s core .",
    "the p - wave contrast across this boundary was soon established ; _ birch _ [ 1940 ] and _ bullen _ [ 1946 ] argued that the inner core must be solid based on this estimate .",
    "the best evidence for inner core solidity comes from studies of inner core sensitive normal modes [ _ dziewonski and gilbert , 1971 _ ] : earth models with finite shear modulus of the inner core provide a significantly better fit to eigenfrequency observations than those with a liquid inner core .",
    "recent observations of body wave phases involving a shear wave in the inner core ( pkjkp , skjkp , and ppkjkp ) [ _ okal and cansi , 1998 ; deuss et al",
    ". , 2000 _ ] support solidity , but are still controversial .",
    "the inferred shear wave velocity @xmath0 of the inner core is remarkable : it is low compared to the compressional wave velocity @xmath1 , a property which can also be expressed in terms of the poisson s ratio @xmath2.the value of @xmath2=0.44 for the inner core is nearly that of a liquid ( 0.5 ) , leading to speculation that this region may be partially molten [ _ singh et al . , 2000 _ ] .    in principle density @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath4 , and @xmath5 also depend on depth .",
    "however , constraints on the depth dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath5 are weak .",
    "seismic observations are consistent with an inner core in a state of adiabatic self - compression .",
    "first evidence for deviations from a spherically symmetric structure came from the observation that eigenfrequencies of core sensitive normal modes are split much more strongly than predicted by ellipticity and rotation of the earth alone [ _ masters and gilbert , 1981 _ ] .",
    "anomalies in pkikp travel times were initially interpreted as topography on the inner core [ _ poupinet et al . , 1983 _ ] .",
    "_ morelli et al . _ [ 1986 ] and _ woodhouse et al . _ [ 1986 ] interpreted similar observations of eigenfrequencies and travel times as inner core anisotropy .",
    "observation of differential travel times pkikp - pkp@xmath6 [ _ creager , 1992 ; song and helmberger , 1993 _ ] and a reanalysis of normal mode data [ _ tromp , 1993 _ ] confirmed that the inner core displays a hexagonal ( cylindrical ) pattern of anisotropy with a magnitude of 3 - 4% and symmetry axis nearly parallel to earth s rotation axis . for example , pkikp arrives 5 - 6 s earlier along polar paths than predicted from radially symmetric earth models such as prem [ _ dziewonski and anderson , 1981 _ ] .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that some of the travel time differences could be due to mantle structure not accounted for in the reference model [ _ brger et al . , 1999 ;",
    "ishii et al . , 2002a ; 2002b _ ] .",
    "in particular , small scale heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle could be sampled preferentially for select body wave core paths [ _ bregr et al . , 1999 ; tromp , 2001 ; ishii et al .",
    ", 2002b _ ] .    in further investigation deviations from first order anisotropy have been put forward , for example lateral variations in @xmath1 of the inner core on length scales ranging from hemispherical differences [ _ tanaka and hamaguchi , 1997 ; creager , 1999 ; niu and wen , 2001 _ ] , to hundreds of kilometers [ _ creager , 1997 _ ] , down to a few kilometers [ _ vidale and earle , 2000 _ ] . radial variations may also exist : weak anisotropy may be present in the uppermost inner core ( to a depth of 50 - 100 km ) [ _ shearer , 1994 ; song and helmberger , 1995 ; su and dziewonski , 1995 _ ] and strong uniform anisotropy in its inner half [ _ song and helmberger , 1995 ; creager , 1999 _ ] .",
    "seismological studies of the inner core are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this volume .",
    "seismically determined properties of the core may be compared to laboratory measurements under high compression .",
    "measurements of the equation of state show that only elements with an atomic number close to that of iron satisfy the seismic constraints [ _ birch , 1964 _ ] .",
    "additional arguments are necessary to uniquely implicate iron [ _ jeanloz , 1990 _ ] : iron is one of the most abundant elements in stars and meteorites , much more so than in the portions of the earth that are directly observable [ _ brown and mussett , 1993 _ ] ; and a conducting liquid is necessary in the outer core to explain the existence of a long lived dynamo process that creates earth s magnetic field [ _ merrill et al . , 1996 _ ] .    to the degree that we are certain about the main constituent of the core we are also sure that the core contains other lighter elements :",
    "pure iron can not satisfy the seismological constraints for both portions of the core .",
    "liquid iron is about 10% too dense to satisfy both the density and bulk modulus in the outer core [ _ birch . , 1964 ; jeanloz , 1979 ; brown and mcqueen , 1986 _ ] and while solid iron can explain the bulk modulus of the inner core for reasonable temperatures it overestimates the density even for very high temperature ( 8000 k ) [ _ jephcoat and olson , 1987 ; stixrude et al . , 1997 _ ] .",
    "the identity and amount of the light element is still uncertain , but based on cosmochemical arguments hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , magnesium , silicon , and sulfur have been proposed [ _ poirier , 1994 _ ] , with oxygen and sulfur being the most popular . to infer information on the composition of the core from geochemistry , two questions are of central importance : did the core form in chemical equilibrium [ _ karato and murthy , 1997 _ ] and what are the physical conditions of the core forming event , as pressure and temperature critically determine the partition coefficient of various elements between silicate and metallic melt [ _ ito et al .",
    ", 1995 ; li and agee , 1996 ; okuchi , 1997 _ ] .",
    "alternatively , one may use the available seismological information on the current physical state of the outer and inner core ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 ) and compare to the physical properties of candidate iron alloys at the appropriate pressure and temperature condition .",
    "the compositional space of fe - x with x any light element has been sparsely sampled in shock wave experiments at the conditions relevant for the core . only binary compounds in the fe - s system ( pyrrhotite fe@xmath7s [ _ brown et al .",

    "the data has been extrapolated to inner core conditions [ _ stixrude et al . , 1997 _ ] and compared to the required elastic parameters ( fig .  [ comp ] ) .",
    "this analysis indicates that small amounts of either s or o ( few atomic percent)would be sufficient to match the properties of the inner core .    . for a given temperature ( solid lines )",
    "the required effective bulk modulus is plotted as a function of required effective density .",
    "the dashed lines connect points of common alloy fraction for any light element x ( 2 , 5 , 10 , and 20% from left to right ) . estimated uncertainties in the alloy fractions required are indicated with the error bars on the curve corresponding to 6000 k ( 1% in density and 5% in bulk modulus ) . superimposed are extrapolations of shock wave experimental estimates for feo [ _ jeanloz and ahrens , 1980 ; yagi et al .",

    "[ 2000a ; 2000b ; 2002 ] combined the geophysical approach with a chemical argument .",
    "they evaluated the liquid - solid partition coefficients of candidate light elements assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at the inner core boundary .",
    "the results show that neither s , si , nor o alone can satisfy the observed density contrast at the inner core boundary and that a ternary or higher mixture of small amounts of s or si with o is required .      like the composition , the temperature of the inner core can not be determined by direct observation . assuming that the inner core is growing in equilibrium from incongruent freezing of the outer core liquid a knowledge of the melting behavior of iron - rich systems at the pressure of the inner core boundary ( 330 gpa ) would yield an important fixed - point temperature for the construction of whole earth geotherms .",
    "because the core is not a pure system , the temperature at the inner core boundary should differ from the melting point of pure iron .",
    "freezing point depression in an eutectic system with no solid solution is given by the van laar equation [ _ brown and mcqueen , 1982 _ ] which yields a value of 800 k for a melting point of iron of 6000 k and 10% mole fraction of the light element .",
    "the value for the freezing point depression must be viewed as highly uncertain , however , since solid solution almost certainly exists at the high temperatures of the core .",
    "an independent estimate of the temperature of the core may be obtained by comparing the elastic properties of iron with those seismologically determined .",
    "we describe this approach as applied to the inner core below .",
    "seismic observations do provide constraints on some aspects of the thermal stateof the core . in the outer core",
    "the compressional wave velocity @xmath1 equals the bulk sound velocity @xmath10 . in a homogeneous ,",

    "@xmath12 for the outer core is constrained by seismology to be 1@xmath160.05 [ _ masters , 1979 _ ] .",
    "this is consistent with ( but does not uniquely require ) a vigorously convecting outer core , and a resulting geotherm close to an adiabat , characterized by the gradient : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the grneisen parameter . adopting the value measured for liquid iron at core conditions ( @xmath18=1.5 ) [ _ brown and mcqueen , 1986 _ ] and a temperature at the inner core boundary of 6000 k ,",
    "one finds a temperature contrast of 1500 k across the outer core .",
    "the temperature contrast in the inner core is likely to be small .",
    "we can place an upper bound on it by assuming that the inner core is a perfect thermal insulator .",
    "if the inner core grows through freezing of the outer core its temperature profile will follow the solidus temperature .",
    "based on this assumption _ stixrude et al . _",
    "[ 1997 ] estimated the total temperature difference across the inner core to be less than 400 k. conductive or convective heat loss will further reduce this temperature gradient relative to the insulating case .",
    "conduction is likely to be a very effective way to extract heat from the inner core , such that the temperature profile may fall below an adiabat [ _ yukutake , 1998 ; buffett , 2000 _ ] .      _",
    "song and richards _ [ 1996 ] found that the differential travel time of pkikp - pkp@xmath6 for earthquakes in the south sandwich islands recorded in alaska increased by 0.3 s over a period of three decades , and concluded that the inner core rotates relative to the mantle by 1@xmath19/year , a finding that was confirmed qualitatively using global data sets [ _ su et al .",

    "_ creager _ [ 1997 ] showed that part of the signal could be explained by lateral heterogeneity in the inner core , and reassessed the rotation rate to a lower value .",
    "recent years have seen body wave [ _ souriau , 1998 _ ] and free oscillations studies [ _ laske and masters , 1999 _ ] that can not resolve inner core rotation , and put close bounds on rotation rate .",
    "if it is present , differential inner core rotation would provide one of the few opportunities for direct observations of the dynamics in earth s deep interior . moreover",
    ", differential rotation could have a significant effect on the angular momentum budget of the earth yielding an explanation of decadal fluctuations in the length of day [ _ buffett , 1996 ; buffett and creager , 1999 _ ] .",
    "its origin is not fully understood , but geodynamo simulations produce super - rotation by electro - magnetic coupling with the overlying outer core [ _ glatzmaier and roberts , 1996 ; kuang and bloxham , 1997 ; aurnou et al . , 1998 _ ] .",
    "gravitational stresses , arising from mass anomalies in the mantle , are also expected to act on the inner core [ _ buffett _ , 1996 ; 1997 ] . these tend to work against super - rotation by gravitationally locking the inner core into synchronous rotation with the mantle . in detail , the interplay between forces driving and resisting super - rotation depend on the rheology of the inner core , which is currently unknown .",
    "if the viscosity is sufficiently low , super - rotation may take place , with the consequence that the inner core undergoes continuous viscous deformation in response to the gravitational perturbations .",
    "the interaction of super - rotation with gravitational stresses is just one of many proposed sources of internal deformation in the inner core .",
    "the subject has received substantial attention because solid state flow in the inner core can result in lattice - preferred orientation , thought to be essential for producing seismically observed anisotropy .",
    "other proposed sources of stress in the inner core include : +",
    "( a ) coupling with the magnetic field generated in the overlying outer core [ _ karato , 1999 ; buffett and bloxham , 2000 ; buffett and wenk , 2001 _ ] .",
    "_ karato _ [ 1999 ] considered the radial component of the lorentz force ( @xmath20 ) at the inner core boundary which is caused by the zonal magnetic field ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is typically the strongest contribution to the lorentz force in geodynamo models [ _ glatzmaier and roberts , 1995 ; kuang and bloxham , 1997 _ ] . _",
    "buffett and bloxham _ [ 2000 ] argue that the inner core adjusts to @xmath20 in a way to minimize steady solid state flow : only weak flow in the inner core is induced that is largely confined to the outermost portion .",
    "considering additional terms to the lorentz force @xmath22 by including radial components of the magnetic field @xmath23 they conclude that the azimuthal term @xmath24 which is proportional to @xmath25 induces a steady shear flow throughout the inner core .",

    "fundamental considerations , based on the expected cylindrical symmetry of flow in the outer core , and detailed geodynamo simulations [ _ glatzmaier and roberts , 1995 _ ] indicate that heat is transported more efficiently in the equatorial plane than along the poles , leading to an inhomogeneous growth rate of the inner core , and internal viscous relaxation .",
    "a key question is whether the magnitude of the effect is sufficient to produce lattice preferred orientation . in particular , the resulting strain rates are very small , and may not be sufficient to generate significant polycrystalline texture via recrystallization .",
    "it has also been proposed that polycrystalline texture in the inner core may be acquired during solidification [ _ karato , 1993 ; bergman , 1997 _ ] . however ,",
    "if the inner core does experience solid state deformation , by one or more of the mechanisms described above , it is unclear to what extent the texture acquired during solidification would be preserved .",
    "it is possible that texture in the outermost portions of the inner core is dominated by the solidification process , whereas lattice preferred orientation in the bulk of the inner core is produced by deformation .",
    "further progress in our understanding of the composition , temperature , dynamics , and origin of anisotropy in the inner core is currently limited by our lack of knowledge of the properties of iron and iron alloys at high pressures and temperatures",
    ". a better understanding of elastic and other properties of iron at inner core conditions can provide a way to test hypotheses concerning the state and dynamics of the inner core .",

    "<S> the earth s inner core plays a vital role in the dynamics of our planet and is itself strongly exposed to dynamic processes as evidenced by a complex pattern of elastic structure . to gain deeper insight into the nature of these processes we rely on a characterization of the physical properties of the inner core which are governed by the material physics of its main constituent , iron . here </S>",
    "<S> we review recent research on structure and dynamics of the inner core , focusing on advances in mineral physics . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss results on core composition , crystalline structure , temperature , and various aspects of elasticity . </S>",
    "<S> based on recent computational results , we will show that aggregate seismic properties of the inner core can be explained by temperature and compression effects on the elasticity of pure iron , and use single crystal anisotropy to develop a speculative textural model of the inner core that can explain major aspects of inner core anisotropy . </S>"
