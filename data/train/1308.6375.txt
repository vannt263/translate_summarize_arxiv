    "spitzer_/irac source is located at @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "a near - ir ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) source at @xmath55 and @xmath56 is closely associated with the _ spitzer _ source .",
    "the irac and near - ir objects have astrometric errors including the statistical and systematic errors of 0.3 and 0.2  arcsec respectively , therefore the centroid positions of the irac and near - ir objects are in agreement within the positional uncertainties . on the other hand , an optical ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) source at @xmath57 and @xmath58 is located @xmath59 and @xmath9 away from the irac and near - ir sources . given the @xmath60 astrometry of @xmath61 , the positional offsets between the @xmath60 object and near - ir and mid - ir objects are significant , so the optical object is a possible lensing galaxy , because a lensing object is typically located within a few arcsec @xcite for a galaxy  galaxy lens system .",
    "the 1.1 mm and submm emissions may arise from cold ( @xmath1520 k ) dust in the molecular cores residing in the smc or the galaxy .",
    "if mmj0107 were located at the smc , the spatial extent of the 1.1 mm source ( @xmath62 ) would require the source size of @xmath6310  pc , which can be a compact molecular cloud in the smc .",
    "we estimate the dust temperature and gas mass assuming a molecular cloud in the smc using the 1.1 mm to 250 @xmath2 data .",
    "we use dust emissivity @xmath64 @xcite , index of emissivity @xmath65 , and a gas - to - dust ratio of 700 @xcite . as a result of single component @xmath66-fitting ,",
    "we get a dust temperature of @xmath67 k and gas mass of @xmath68 .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the 10 k dust component dominates in the scale of a molecular cloud .",
    "additionally , hi distribution @xcite around mmj0107 has no local peaks at the velocity of the smc , implying that no molecular cloud exists .",
    "therefore , mmj0107 is not likely to be located at the distance of the smc .",
    "the dust temperature of 10 k might also be explained by a molecular cloud core in our galaxy . in the smc wing region , however , there is no strong concentration of galactic i gas , which is unnatural for a galactic source .",
    "we estimate the photometric redshifts by spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of template galaxies .",
    "we use four sed templates of galaxies : nearby starburst galaxies arp  220 and m82 @xcite , averaged sed of 76 smgs , and the well - known lensed galaxy smm  j2135@xmath10102 @xcite .",
    "we use the multi - wavelength data set at wavelengths longer than 20 @xmath2 : most , atca ( for upper limit ) , aztec / aste , _",
    "herschel_/spire , and _",
    "spitzer_/mips ( 70/160 @xmath2 for upper limit ) and _ wise _ w4 for sed template fittings .",
    "we do not use the optical data due to the significant offset from near - ir and mid - ir objects implying the lensing galaxy .",
    "we also do not use the near - ir and mid - ir photometric data because these bands strongly depend on stellar synthesis models and dust extinction , and may possibly be contaminated by the foreground lensing object .",
    "figure [ figure : sed ] shows photometric redshift estimates .",
    "the estimate using the m82 template gives a photometric redshift of @xmath69 and a fir luminosity of @xmath70 , which shows the largest redshift and luminosity , and the least reduced-@xmath66 value among all templates .",
    "the errors indicate the 68.3% confidence intervals for statistical errors without consideration of systematic bias by the template selection .",
    "the result of arp  220 fitting shows @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the averaged - smgs template shows @xmath73 and @xmath74 , although the sed at @xmath75 and @xmath76 is also probable .",
    "the best - fit sed of the averaged smgs is in good agreement with near - ir and mid - ir bands .",
    "the smm  j2135@xmath10102 template shows @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the photometric redshift estimated using the four sed templates ranges 1.43.9 and fir luminosity of @xmath10@xmath79 .",
    "the excesses of the 843 mhz photometry to the best - fit sed models are quantified by @xmath80-value , which is defined as @xmath81/3.75\\times 10^{12}/l_{\\nu,~\\mathrm{1.4~ghz}}[l_\\sun~\\mathrm{hz^{-1}}])$ ] .",
    "the @xmath80-values are estimated to be @xmath82 for m82 , @xmath83 for arp  220 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the averaged - smgs ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively ) , and @xmath87 for smm  j2135@xmath10102 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath80-values of mmj0107 are consistent with the dispersion of typical smg samples , but relatively lower than the mean value .",
    "this may imply the existence of a radio - loud agn , although this can also be explained by the photometric error of the 843 mhz data by confusion of unresolved radio sources , or enhancement of synchrotron emission expected for a spatially extended starburst ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    ", we investigate the sfr of mmj0107 from the fir luminosity , following : @xmath88 which is a scaling law determined from local starburst galaxies .",
    "the inferred range in fir luminosity corresponds to an sfr of @xmath12@xmath89 .",
    "this extremely high sfr is unphysical , and can be accounted for by strong lensing magnification of a galaxy  galaxy lens system , although the sfr can be overestimated due to dust emission powered by an agn . if we assume the maximum magnification factor @xmath90 , which has been reported by the sloan lens acs survey @xcite , this reduces the intrinsic sfr of @xmath91@xmath92 , which is similar to those often found in unlensed smgs and ulirgs .",
    "accordingly , an active star - forming galaxy highly magnified by a gravitational lens is the most likely explanation for mmj0107 .",
    "we found one ultra - bright smg in the 1.21 @xmath21 field , corresponding to a number density of @xmath93 ( @xmath42 43  mjy ) .",
    "in addition , 1.1 mm deep surveys by the aztec instrument toward goods - n @xcite , ssa22 @xcite , lockman hole @xcite , goods - s @xcite , adf - s @xcite , sxdf @xcite , and cosmos @xcite found only one ultra - bright smg ( orochi , @xmath94  mjy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a total area of 2.0 @xmath21",
    ". thus , the cumulative number counts at @xmath42 35  mjy are approximately @xmath95 ( i.e. , two sources in a 3.2 @xmath21 region ) .",
    "here we compare this to the number count of ultra - bright galaxies detected by _",
    "herschel_-atlas sdp sources .",
    "since the 500 @xmath2 to 1.1 mm flux ratio of mmj0107 ( @xmath154 ) is smaller than those of _",
    "herschel_-atlas sdp sources ( 58 ; * ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming the flux ratio of 4 as the lower limit , the flux density of 35  mjy at 1.1  mm corresponds to 140  mjy at 500 @xmath2 .",
    "there are four lensed smgs that have flux densities of @xmath96 140  mjy at 500 @xmath2 in _",
    "herschel_-atlas sdp field of 14.4 @xmath21 @xcite , corresponding to a cumulative count of @xmath97 .",
    "we also compare the 1.1 mm number density with the 1.4 mm one of spt @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the 1.1 mm counts using 1.4 mm data assuming a spectral index of @xmath98 .",
    "the flux density of @xmath96 35  mjy at 1.1  mm corresponds to 19  mjy at 1.4  mm .",
    "the number density of dust - dominated sources is @xmath99 .",
    "accordingly , the number density of 1.1 mm selected ultra - bright smgs is consistent with 500 @xmath2 and 1.4 mm counts .",
    "we pointed out that the @xmath60 object located at @xmath9 away from near - ir counterparts can be the lensing object . in this case , the decrease in the flux at @xmath6 band is caused by the 4000break , and the redshift of the lensing object can be @xmath100 . on the other hand , it is also possible that the near - ir emission arises from the lensing galaxy , although it is hard to estimate the photometric redshift because of the lack of a spectral feature in observed near - ir bands .",
    "alternatively , we estimate the redshift of the lensing object using a well - known correlation between @xmath101-band magnitude and redshift ( @xmath101@xmath102 relation ) for the radio - selected massive elliptical galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the @xmath101-band luminosity between 0.3 and 14 @xmath103 ) .",
    "the @xmath101-band luminosity range is reasonable for lensing galaxies : for example , strong lensing systems _ herschel_-atlas sdp  9 , 17 , and 81 @xcite have the observed - frame @xmath101-band luminosities of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 including the @xmath107-correction @xcite , respectively .",
    "the luminosities correspond to 26  @xmath103 for the local luminosity function , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the lensing galaxy of mmj0107 is similar to ellipticals observed by @xcite , then @xmath108 observed for mmj0107 gives a redshift of @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the near - ir object can also be the lensing galaxy . in this case",
    ", the @xmath60 object would be unrelated with this lens system , or even might be an interacting galaxy associated with mmj0107 at @xmath110 , if the decrement at @xmath6 band is attributed to the lyman break .",
    "however , due to the lack of short wavelength data , it is difficult to further discuss the lensing object and the intrinsic properties of mmj0107 .",
    "additional near - ir and optical observations are needed .",
    "in this letter , we have reported a new ultra - bright smg behind the smc .",
    "the 1.1 mm flux density of mmj0107 is 43.3@xmath528.4  mjy , making it one of the brightest smgs found in aztec / aste 1.1-mm continuum observations .",
    "the sed fittings of mmj0107 show the redshift of 1.43.9 and the fir luminosity of @xmath10@xmath111 , which corresponds to the sfr of @xmath12@xmath112 , suggesting that mmj0107 is a highly magnified lensed smg .",
    "further spectroscopic observations of mm / submm emission lines for mmj0107 will allow us not only to determine the redshift , but also to estimate the mass and physical state of the cool gas components , which makes it possible to constrain the star formation activities in mmj0107 .",
    "this study demonstrates that a high - redshift galaxy can be reasonably separated from foreground objects through multi - band photometry , as described in section [ l : result ] .",
    "further investigation in existing mm / submm data taken toward nearby galaxies and galactic star - forming regions allows us to find more ultra - bright smgs , which will improve the statistics of the brightest part of the number counts .",
