    "exactly solvable models e.g. models for which set of physical quantities such as the bulk free energy , the interfacial tension , some critical exponents etc . can be calculated analytically , play important role in statistical mechanics and the phase transitions theory .",
    "most solvable statistical models are two - dimensional ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "ybe , or star - triangle equation , serves as integrability condition , or transfer - matrices commutativity condition for @xmath0 solvable models . unlike @xmath0 models , solvable models in @xmath1 are very rare examples .",
    "usually solvable @xmath1 models  see e.g. zamolodchikov model @xcite and its generalizations @xcite  are based on solution of tetrahedron equation .",
    "the latter is natural generalization of yang - baxter equation ybe and serves as transfer - matrices in @xmath1 commutativity condition .",
    "unfortunately all @xmath1 solvable models known so far possess common rather unsatisfactory feature , from the viewpoint of applications to statistical mechanics  they incurably have negative @xcite or even complex @xcite boltzmann weights .",
    "since these weights are probabilities ( up to a normalization),this property makes statistical mechanical interpretation of the models highly problematical ( although the associated quantum problem may still be sensible ) .",
    "recently the method was proposed in @xcite which allows to construct solvable statistical models ( however anisotropic ) with positive boltzmann weights and local interactions in @xmath1 starting from solvable @xmath0 models .",
    "the idea is the following : the whole row of infinite number of separate sites ( vertexes ) is considered as a simplest object . the states probabilities ( boltzmann weights )",
    "are defined as product of those for each site separately , multiplied by interaction factors depending upon the local configurations of each two neighbouring sites .",
    "such construction leads to multilayered models on @xmath1-lattice , consisting of @xmath0 integrable planes - layers , with specific interaction between them .",
    "what is important is that transfer - matrix commutativity condition turns out to be not tetrahedron equation but an infinite set of usual yang - baxter equations .",
    "these equations can be satisfied simultaneously , producing the variety of @xmath1-extended models @xcite satisfying the necessary physical requirements  positivity of boltzmann weights and locality of interactions .    here",
    "we investigate the simplest example of such a model  @xmath1-extended 6-vertex model , with the homogenious set of interplane coupling constants .",
    "6-vertex model is rather popular object to study , because of being limiting case for many solvable models in critical region ( see e.g. @xcite ) . @xmath1",
    "solvable extension for 6-vertex model was obtained in @xcite and in @xcite generalized onto other solvable vertex models with charge conservation and inhomogenious sequences of interplane interaction constants . in @xcite",
    "the phase diagram for the free fermions case was conjectured .",
    "here we go beyond this restriction and obtain the phase diagram in the general 3-parameter space , for the extended 6-vertex model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we remind the definition of the anisotropic @xmath1-extended 6-vertex model and consider the strong interplane interaction limit .",
    "then we give the alternative derivation of bethe ansatz ( ba ) equations , using the established gauge equivalence of our multilayer model to the set of @xmath0 6-vertex planes , each one in a field defined by the polarization of planes ",
    "neighbours . using the symmetries of ba",
    ", we prove the equivalence between the model with homogenious set of interaction constants and some models with inhomogenious sets .",
    "we make use of these results , together with hypothesis of non - degeneracy of maximal eigenvalue , to eliminate the problem .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is obtained in the next section .",
    "conclusion and discussing the possible generalizations closes the paper .",
    "the model we consider is system of @xmath2 planes .",
    "each of these planes is the symmetric 6-vertex solvable model on square @xmath3 lattice @xcite .",

    "however we have failed to find there numerically the phases with @xmath174 .",
    "from that we conclude that another members of hierarchy , with @xmath175 do nt appear , too .",
    "we suggest that the higher members of hierarchy do appear when one includes into consideration more distant than nearest neighbours , plane - plane interaction .",
    "for instance , we have checked that the phase with @xmath176 ( [ a=3 ] ) does enter the phase diagram when one includes additional interaction between the planes @xmath177 .",
    "we have shown in the last two sections that the set of polarization constants @xmath178 which corresponds to the maximal eigenvalue ( the maximal set ) must have the period divisible by 4 : @xmath179 .",
    "for the simplest case @xmath180 the maximal set is ( [ t=4 ] ) and the transfer - matrix eigenvalue is given by eq.([4period ] ) , with the substitution @xmath181 @xmath182 we can always choose @xmath183 and @xmath184 positive .",
    "therefore we only have to maximize the eigenvalue ( [ gev ] ) within the two - parameter space @xmath185 by means of the newton - ralphson method we are able to solve ba equations directly and find the block with largest eigen - value for system size up to @xmath186 .",
    "it turns out however that the maximal eigen - value for all values of parameters @xmath49 and @xmath84 belongs either to the block @xmath187 ( in that case @xmath84 vanishes from all equations ( [ ev],[ba ] ) , yielding the known results for 6-vertex model ) , or to the block with at least one of @xmath188 , say @xmath189 equal to zero : @xmath190 .",
    "finally the bethe ansatz ( [ ev],[ba ] ) rewritten @xmath191 note that the eigen - value is invariant under the transformation : @xmath192 .",
    "figures [ fig3a]-[fig3d ] show the phase diagram of the model in the space of boltzmann weights ratios @xmath193 , for the different values of interplane constant @xmath84 .",
    "fig.3 ( decoupled planes , @xmath84=0 ) repeats well - known results for usual 6-vertex model : the three distinct phases exist separated by the lines @xmath194 .",
    "these phases are ( for details see @xcite ) :    i. antiferroelectric phase .",
    "c - vertexes ( type 5 and 6 ) are dominant ; in sufficiently low temperatures vertex plane configuration is filled with arrows alternating in both directions with step 1 .",
    "disordered phase @xmath195 .",
    "all types of vertexes are present ; there are no types of vertexes which are dominant .",
    "here lies the high temperature limit so one should expect disorder .",
    "ferroelectric phase @xmath196 .",
    "phase iii occupies two separated regions , the left upper and the right bottom in the phase diagram . in the left upper region , @xmath197 , each plane is occupied by either exclusively type 3 , or exclusively type 4 vertexes .",
    "it is convenient to consider the arrow resulting from vector summation of all arrows in the plane :    for the type 3 configuration , all arrows on the plane are pointing up and to the left , resulting is upleft arrow @xmath198 , whereas for the type 4 configuration , the resulting is downright arrow @xmath199 , see fig.2 .",
    "polarization vector ( [ yk ] ) modulus reaches its maximum @xmath200 , namely , @xmath201 for the type 3 configuration and @xmath202 for the type 4 configuration .",
    "if we associate with the each plane @xmath18 the corresponding arrow  @xmath198 for type 3 , @xmath199 for type 4 configuration , then the state of the multiplane model in phase iii , left upper region , is characterized by the random sequence   [ iii ] consisting of these arrows randomly placed .",
    "of course switching on some vanishing external field favouring type 3 configuration will lift up this degeneracy , giving the homogenious sequence : @xmath203 the state of the model in the right bottom region , phase iii , @xmath204 will be analogously characterized by the type 1 , type 2 vertexes configurations , or upright , downleft @xmath205 arrows .",
    "@xmath206    in fig.[fig3b]- [ fig3d ] the phase diagrams for the systems with a fixed @xmath84 in increasing order are given .",
    "the phases i - iii are exactly the same as in uncoupled planes limit in fig.[fig3a ] . for nonzero coupling @xmath84 the regions occupied by the phase iii",
    "are given by the formula @xmath207 , and two new phases arise .",
    "v. layered antiferroelectric phase .",
    "this phase is exactly the one described as the strong interplane coupling limit in section 2 .",
    "each plane is in ferroelectric phase , but plane @xmath34 configuration strictly follows from one in @xmath18-th plane by @xmath208 clockwise rotation .",
    "so , the planes - layers in increasing order are formed by the unique , up to shifting , sequence of vertexes , or resulting arrows : @xmath209 ( compare with the sequence ( [ iii ] ) ) .    in that phase polarization vector ( [ yk ] ) alternates each other plane @xmath210 : ",
    "y_k , y_k+1 , ",
    "1;-1;-1;1;1;-1;-1;1    [ 0110 ] forming the layered antiferroelectric structure ( in each separate plane the structure is ferroelectric ) polarization vector modulus in each plane reaches its maximal value @xmath211 , any @xmath18 .",
    "v. phase v is an intermediate phase which can be described as follows : system splits into two subsystems , each contains two planes @xmath18-th and @xmath212-th , e.g. ( the first and the third ) and ( the second and the fourth ) . in one of the subsystems the planes are in ferroelectric phase , with alternating polarization vector @xmath213 .",
    "another subsystem is partially disordered @xmath214 .",
    "again as the previous one , this structure has period 4 . within the phase 4 ,",
    "@xmath215 varies ( see fig .",
    "4a , b ) ; on transition line between phases iv / v @xmath215 goes to zero continuously , forming the strong interplane coupling structure in phase 4 . for the free fermions limit , @xmath85 , or @xmath216 , value of @xmath215",
    "is known exactly ( see @xcite ) x = a b 4h ,   for   a < b    outside the free fermions curve , the branches with equal polarizations are arranged quite regular , as is seen from fig.[fig4a],[fig4b ] .",
    "however we can not present the exact formula for the moment .",
    "the analytical and numerical calculations show that there are no other phases at the phase diagram .",
    "the second order phase transition between the phases v / iv can be found considering the equality ( n / n 0 ) = 1 [ oneparticle ] .",
    "proceeding analogously as in @xcite we get @xmath217 . for @xmath218",
    "we have @xmath219 and @xmath220 , or using ( [ delta ] ) , b / c = ( a / c )   -1 [ second1 ] all phase curves are symmetrical with respect to @xmath221 line .    proceeding with the same equality ( [ oneparticle ] ) and taking @xmath222 , we obtain : = [ ch4h ] but now this line marks only right margin for the phase transition iii / v , and not necessarily the exact point .",
    "we have found however with all numerical accuracy that line ( [ ch4h ] ) is exact transition point indeed . with increasing @xmath84 , the phases iv and v expand in space , and the others diminish .",
    "when @xmath84 reaches @xmath223 and higher , phase ii disappears completely as is shown in fig.[fig3d ] .",
    "the fraction of space occupying by the phases ii , iii , diminishes exponentially with @xmath84 , as is seen from ( [ second1 ] , [ ch4h ] ) .    finally , the transition line between the phases ii / iv ( ii / v ) or i / iv ( i / v ) in fig.[fig3b]-[fig3d ] is obtained numerically .",
    "the line ends in points ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,0 ) which agrees with the limiting ising chain case .",
    "phase transition ii / iv ( ii / v ) or i / iv ( i / v ) is of first order . indeed in phases",
    "ii or i the partition sum does not depend on @xmath84 at all ; ( all @xmath224 and polarization vector @xmath66 for all @xmath18 is zero .",
    "the values of @xmath66-set jump when crossing the critical curve and dependence on @xmath84 shows up .",
    "so the partition sum will have a cusp as a function of @xmath84 .",
    "the transition iv / v is of the second order . on this line ,",
    "the order parameters  polarization vectors @xmath66 ( [ yk ] ) change continuously when approaching the critical point .",
    "the second derivative for free energy over @xmath84 diverges as inverse square root @xmath225 in the critical point ( pokrovsky - talapov type transition @xcite ) .",
    "we have described the phase diagram of the @xmath1-extended model with the homogenious set of constants .",
    "the phase diagrams for the models with arbitrary sets of @xmath93 and @xmath94 constants are the same , with redefinition of phases ( see eqs.([equiv1]-[equiv3 ] ) ) .",
    "note that for the model with alternating constants , @xmath226 , the period is always 2 ( in planes ) .",
    "we have obtained the phase diagram for 3d solvable multilayered 6-vertex model , in full 3-parameter space .",
    "the model enjoys locality of interactions and positivity of boltzmann weights .",
    "the applicability of the method to other solvable vertex models with ice rule ( [ ccc ] ) is shown in @xcite . in view of possible applications , note that the strength of layer- layer interaction @xmath84 can vary from plane to plane , as well as anysotropy parameter within each layer .",
    "another possibility is to include more distant than nearest neighbour , interactions along 3-rd axis .",
    "the resulting solvable models are ones with competing interactions @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is the universality class of the model we have considered .",
    "the finite size scaling analysis ( see e.g.@xcite ) of new ( due to plane - plane coupling ) critical phase , named v in the phase diagram , shows that it is described by @xmath0 conformal field theory with central charge @xmath227 .",
    "thus it belongs to the same universality class as the  source  6-vertex model .",

    "doochul kim for nice introduction to finite size scaling .",
