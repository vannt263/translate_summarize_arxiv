    "uniform random perfect matchings ( or dimer coverings ) of a bipartite , infinite , planar periodic graph @xmath10 ( e.g. @xmath11 or the hexagonal lattice @xmath12 ) play a crucial role in statistical mechanics and combinatorics , and a vast literature exists on the subject ( cf . for instance the classical papers @xcite and the much more recent @xcite ) . on one hand , thanks to the bijection between perfect matchings and discrete height functions ( see section [ sec : height ] ) , they provide natural and exactly solvable models of random @xmath13-dimensional interfaces ( which can be thought of as simplified models for the interface separating two coexisting thermodynamic phases @xcite ) . on the other hand , thanks to their conformal invariance and gaussian free field - like fluctuation properties in the scaling limit @xcite , they belong , like the ising model at @xmath14 , to the family of critical two - dimensional systems .    in contrast",
    ", the study of stochastic dynamics of perfect matchings is a much less developed topic .",
    "typically , one takes a large but finite portion @xmath15 of the graph @xmath10 and defines a simple glauber - type markov chain such that each update locally modifies the matching within @xmath15 .",
    "the unique equilibrium measure is the uniform measure over perfect matchings of @xmath15 . from the point of view of theoretical computer science @xcite ,",
    "the interesting question is to understand how quickly , as a function of the size of @xmath15 , the markov chain approaches equilibrium ( i.e. how quickly it samples reliably a uniformly chosen random perfect matching of @xmath15 ) . from the point of view of statistical physics , thanks to the above mentioned bijection between perfect matchings and height functions , this markov chain can be seen as a dynamics for a @xmath13-dimensional interface  and it is of interest to understand how the geometry of the interface evolves in time .",
    "for instance , when @xmath16 the evolution of the height function exactly coincides with the zero - temperature heat - bath dynamics for an interface , separating `` @xmath17 '' from `` @xmath18 '' spins , of the three - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model @xcite .    until recently , the best mathematical result on this dynamics issues was that , when @xmath19 or @xmath16 , the total - variation mixing time @xmath5 of the markov chain is at most polynomial in the size of @xmath15 .",
    "see section [ sec : previous ] for a short review .",
    "results of this type are based on simple but effective coupling arguments that unfortunately have little chance of providing the sharp behavior of @xmath5 .",
    "( a notable exception is the work @xcite , where sharp bounds on @xmath5 for @xmath16 were given , but for a very particular , spatially non - local , dynamics ) .    in @xcite , instead , in the case where @xmath16 it was proven that , under a certain condition on the shape of the finite region @xmath15 ( `` almost planar boundary condition '' assumption , see below ) , @xmath5 behaves like @xmath20 , up to logarithmic corrections , if @xmath9 is the diameter of @xmath15 .",
    "as we briefly explain in section [ sec : novelty ] , going beyond the case of the hexagonal lattice @xmath12 is a mathematical challenge , since certain exact identities that hold there do not survive on more general graphs . in this work",
    "we prove that , when @xmath19 ( and in a few other cases , see below ) , again under the `` planar boundary condition '' assumption , @xmath21 .",
    "we present this result , still informally but with a bit more of detail , in the next section .",
    "the major improvement with respect to @xcite is that both @xcite and the present work use the intuition that the height function should evolve , on a diffusive time - space scale , according to a deterministic , anisotropic mean - curvature type evolution @xcite .",
    "more precisely , call @xmath22 the height function at time @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a bi - dimensional space coordinate on the lattice @xmath10 . then",
    ", one expects that under diffusive scaling ( i.e. setting @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and letting @xmath28 ) the limiting deterministic evolution of the height function @xmath29 should be of the type @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is a positive , slope - dependent `` mobility coefficient '' while @xmath32 , directly related to the first variation of the surface energy functional , is a non - linear elliptic operator of the type @xmath33 where the matrix @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) is positive - definite .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of these issues .",
    "remark that @xmath36 is a linear combination ( with slope - dependent coefficients ) of the principal curvatures of the interface , hence the name `` anisotropic mean - curvature evolution '' . by the way",
    ", such intuition suggests the precise scaling @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath38 the solution of approaches a `` limit shape '' @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 , and one can consider that equilibrium is reached when @xmath41 ( the typical equilibrium height fluctuations before space rescaling being expected to be @xmath42 , see remark [ rem : refined ] ) . assume for simplicity that the matrix @xmath43 is the identity and @xmath44 is constant : then , is just the heat equation and is satisfied as soon as @xmath45 is a suitable constant times @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath23 is some constant times @xmath47 .",
    "a domino tiling of the plane is a covering of @xmath48 with @xmath49 non - overlapping vertical or horizontal rectangles ( dominos ) , with vertices sitting at points of @xmath50 .",
    "domino tilings are in one - to - one correspondence with perfect matchings ( or simply `` matchings '' in the following ) of @xmath51 , i.e. subsets of edges ( called dimers ) of @xmath11 such that each vertex is contained in exactly one dimer ( to see the correspondence , just draw a segment of unit length inside each domino , parallel to its longer side , with endpoints on @xmath11 ) .",
    "similarly , tilings of a finite portion @xmath52 of the plane correspond to matchings of a finite subset @xmath15 of @xmath11 . from now on ,",
    "we will abandon the tiling language and adopt the matching one .",
    "typically , if the set @xmath15 does admit matchings ( an obvious necessary condition is that its cardinality is even ) and its area is large , the number @xmath53 of matchings grows like the exponential of a constant times its area .",
    "this is for instance the case when @xmath54 , in which case @xmath55 , where @xmath3 is catalan s constant @xcite .",
    "a natural way to uniformly sample one among so many matchings ( even if computationally not the most efficient , see section [ moreffi ] ) is to run a markov chain where , with unit rate , two vertical dimers belonging to the same square face of @xmath56 are flipped to vertical , or vice - versa .",
    "the unique stationary ( and reversible ) measure is the uniform measure over all matchings of @xmath15 and a classical question in theoretical computer science @xcite is to evaluate how quickly the markov chain reaches equilibrium , as a function of the diameter ( call it @xmath9 ) of @xmath15 .",
    "this is measured for instance via the so - called total - variation mixing time @xmath5 , defined as the first time @xmath23 such that , uniformly in the initial condition , the law of the chain at time @xmath23 is within variation distance @xmath57 from equilibrium ( see section [ sec : dynamics ] for a definition in formulas ) .    in the present work we prove that @xmath58 , under a non - trivial restriction ( `` almost - planar boundary height '' condition ) on the shape of the region @xmath15 , that we briefly introduce now .",
    "the lattice @xmath11 being a bipartite graph , it is possible to associate in a canonical way ( see section [ sec : height ] ) a discrete height function ( defined on faces of @xmath15 ) to each matching of @xmath15 .",
    "the height along the boundary @xmath59 of @xmath15 is instead independent of the matching and depends only on the shape of @xmath15 .",
    "we say that _ the boundary height of @xmath15 is `` almost planar '' _ if the graph of the height function , restricted to @xmath59 , is within distance of order @xmath4 from some plane of @xmath60 . in this case , for @xmath9 large the height function of a typical matching of @xmath15 ( sampled from the uniform measure ) is macroscopically planar not only along @xmath59 but also in the interior of @xmath15 ( see theorem [ th : stimeflutt ] ) .",
    "the almost - planar boundary height hypothesis is verified for instance when @xmath15 is the @xmath0 square as above .",
    "more general domain shapes that verify this hypothesis are introduced in @xcite ( `` temperley boundary conditions '' ) and in that case the height function fluctuations are proven to converge to the gaussian free field @xcite .",
    "our main result can be informally stated as follows ( see sections [ sec : height ] and [ sec : dynamics ] for a precise statement of the hypothesis and of the result ) :    [ th : informal ] if the diameter of @xmath15 is @xmath9 and the boundary height is almost planar then , as @xmath9 goes to infinity , @xmath61 the result holds also when @xmath11 is replaced by the hexagon or square - hexagon lattices of fig .",
    "[ graphes_et_polygones_newton ] .    based on the `` mean curvature motion '' heuristics mentioned above",
    ", we conjecture the true behavior to be @xmath37 for reasonably regular domains @xmath15 .    as we explain in section [ sec : entro ] , there are good reasons why we can not consider general bipartite periodic planar graphs ( for instance , why our method necessarily fails for the square - octagon graph of fig .",
    "[ graphes_et_polygones_newton ] ) .",
    "this is related to the existence for such graphs of so - called `` gaseous phases '' in their phase diagram @xcite . in a gaseous phase ,",
    "the height function looks qualitatively like a @xmath13-dimensional low temperature solid - on - solid interface ( the interface is rigid , height fluctuations have bounded variance and their spatial correlations decay exponentially . in the scaling limit , the interface does not behave like the gaussian free field in this case ) .",
    "the first mathematical result we are aware of on this problem is in @xcite , where dynamics of perfect matchings of either @xmath62 or @xmath12 are studied .",
    "there , the authors introduced and analyzed a non - local markov dynamics whose updates can involve an unbounded number of dimer rotations ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : fd ] ) . via a coupling argument",
    ", they managed to prove that the mixing time @xmath63 of such dynamics is @xmath64 ( no lower bound was given ) .",
    "subsequently , in the case of the hexagonal lattice @xmath12 this result was sharpened to @xmath65 by wilson @xcite . via the application of comparison arguments for markov chains , these upper bounds for @xmath63 imply",
    "polynomial upper bounds on the mixing time @xmath5 of the local glauber dynamics : indeed , it was deduced in @xcite that @xmath66 for some finite @xmath7 . in this case ,",
    "in the theoretical computer science language , the markov chain is said to be `` rapidly mixing '' ( slow mixing would correspond to @xmath5 being super - polynomial in @xmath9 ) . in the particular case of the hexagonal lattice , using results of @xcite on the spectral gap of the non - local dynamics and the comparison arguments of @xcite , one obtains @xmath67 .",
    "the results we mentioned so far do not require any restriction on the boundary height .",
    "if instead one assumes the boundary height to be almost - planar , for the hexagonal lattice the upper bound in was proven in @xcite ( in the stronger form @xmath68 ) , while the best known lower bound was @xmath69 ( based on @xcite ) .",
    "we are not aware of previous results for the square - hexagon lattice .    the main reason why in theorem [ th : informal ] we require the boundary conditions to be almost - planar is that in this case the height fluctuations at equilibrium ( i.e. under the uniform measure ) are well - controlled , see theorems [ th : clt ] and [ th : stimeflutt ] .",
    "in the case of general boundary conditions , only partial results are known ( e.g. @xcite ) and these are not sufficient to implement our scheme . we emphasize that instead the @xmath6 result of @xcite does not require boundary conditions to be almost - planar .",
    "there are several known algorithms that sample uniform perfect matchings .",
    "the main reason why we focus on the glauber algorithm is its above - mentioned connection with the three - dimensional zero temperature ising dynamics and with interface motion in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "however , there are more efficient algorithms in terms of running time .",
    "let us first of all observe that in algorithmic terms , our theorem [ th : informal ] says that the running time of the glauber dynamics with almost - planar boundary conditions is @xmath70 , i.e. it requires at most that many updates to approach the uniform measure ( our markov chain was defined in continuous time , so that there are of order @xmath20 elementary updates per unit time ) .",
    "there are at least two families of more efficient methods to sample random perfect matchings .    in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it is proven that one can sample uniform perfect matchings of planar graphs @xmath15 in a time @xmath71 , where @xmath72 ( matrix multiplication exponent ) is the exponent of the running time of the best known algorithm to multiply two @xmath73 matrices . in @xcite there is essentially no restriction on the domain @xmath15 ( i.e. no assumption on the boundary height ) , apart from obviously requiring that the number of vertices is of order @xmath20 .",
    "this algorithm can even be used to find a maximum matching for domains that do not admit perfect matchings .",
    "the starting point is a classical formula , the analog of the one in theorem [ thm : proba_evn_fini ] but for finite domains , that expresses the probability of local dimer events in terms of minors of the adjacency matrix of the graph . in the proof of the @xmath71 bound",
    "then @xcite cleverly uses the planarity of the graph and the fact that the adjacency matrix is sparse , to efficiently compute the minors .",
    "the second class of algorithms is based on the mapping between perfect matchings of @xmath15 and spanning trees of a related graph ( t - graph ) that has approximately the same size @xcite .",
    "then one can sample a spanning tree using algorithms based on random walks @xcite , whose running time is expressed in terms of the mean hitting time of the random walk . for reasonable domains ( boundary heights ) one can deduce a @xmath74 bound on the algorithm running time . in the general case",
    "the same bound should still hold but it seems delicate to precisely estimate the mean hitting time in complete generality .      here",
    "we briefly sketch how the proof of theorem [ th : informal ] works , and we point out the main novelties , especially with respect to @xcite .",
    "the idea of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is to break the proof of the upper bound @xmath75 into two steps :    a.   first prove that @xmath76 when the height function is constrained for all times between a `` floor '' and a `` ceiling '' that are at small mutual distance , say @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 is an arbitrarily small , positive , @xmath9-independent constant ; b.   then , via an iterative procedure that mimics the mean curvature motion that should emerge in the diffusive limit , deduce @xmath76 for the unconstrained dynamics .    while this general scheme is robust and",
    "will be employed also here , step ( i ) is very much model - dependent . in particular , in @xcite for the hexagonal graph @xmath12 its implementation was based on the crucial observation ( by d. wilson @xcite ) that , for the non - local dynamics introduced in @xcite ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : fd ] ) , one can write explicitly an eigenfunction of the generator , and the evolution of the height function is controlled by the discrete heat equation . as we explain in remark",
    "[ rem : calore ] , this fact fails for graphs other than @xmath12 and it has to be replaced by a more robust argument .",
    "the `` more robust argument '' starts from the observation that , under the non - local dynamics , the mutual volume @xmath79 between two evolving height functions , that can be seen as an integer - valued random walk , is on average non - increasing with time @xmath23 .",
    "this was already realized in @xcite , but without any further input this only implies a polynomial upper bound @xmath80 on the mixing time @xmath63 of the non - local dynamics .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "the maximal volume between two configurations in a region of diameter @xmath9 , constrained between floor and ceiling at mutual distance @xmath77 , is of order @xmath81 .",
    "the random walk @xmath79 has non - positive drift and it is not hard to see that the variance increase @xmath82 $ ] is bounded away from zero as long as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the sigma - algebra generated by the non - local dynamics up to time @xmath23 .",
    "a simple martingale argument ( see lemma [ lemme : temps_martingale ] ) implies then that @xmath79 will hit the value @xmath85 in a time of order @xmath86 .",
    "when the volume is zero , the two configurations have coalesced and a simple coupling argument allows us to conclude that @xmath87 .",
    "the new input we provide for the proof of point ( i ) ( see section [ sec : mart ] ) is that @xmath82 $ ] can be _ lower bounded _ essentially by @xmath79 itself : then , an iterative application of lemma [ lemme : temps_martingale ] allows to conclude that the coalescence time for the non - local dynamics is of the ( essentially optimal ) order @xmath88 and not @xmath89 . via a comparison argument that relates the mixing times for the local and non - local dynamics ( proposition [ prop : ts ] ) one finally deduces @xmath90 for the _ local _ dynamics ( always constrained between `` floor '' and `` ceiling '' at distance @xmath91 ) .    to prove the bounds on drift and variance of @xmath79",
    ", we introduce a mapping between perfect matchings and configurations of what we call a `` bead model '' .",
    "this mapping turns out to be convenient in that it makes the proofs visually clear . in particular , the definition of the non - local dynamics looks somewhat more natural in this language than in the `` non - intersecting - path '' language @xcite .",
    "a last comment concerns the mixing time lower bound in theorem [ th : informal ] , which is better ( by a factor @xmath46 ) than the lower bound @xmath92 found in @xcite and based on an idea developed in @xcite .",
    "first of all , the proof of @xcite would not extend for instance to @xmath19 , again because it is based on wilson s eigenfunction argument that fails there .",
    "moreover , even for @xmath16 where wilson s argument does work , removing the @xmath46 in the denominator involves a genuinely new idea , see section [ sec : lower_bound ] : one needs to prove that the drift of the volume @xmath79 under the non - local dynamics , which as we mentioned is non - positive , is not smaller than the size of the boundary of @xmath15 , times some negative constant .",
    "all the definitions and results the reader needs about perfect matchings , height functions and translation - invariant infinite measures of a given slope are in section [ sec : back ] ( results are given for general periodic bipartite planar graphs and not just for the square , hexagon and square - hexagon graphs ) .",
    "the dynamics is precisely defined in section [ sec : dynamics ] and its monotonicity properties are discussed in section [ sec : monotonie ] . in section [ sec : billes ] we map height functions into the configurations of a `` bead model '' . in section [ sec : dyn_billes ] we rewrite the dynamics in terms of beads and we introduce two auxiliary , spatially non - local , dynamics , that are essential in proving the mixing time estimates of theorem [ th : informal ] : the mixing time upper bound is proven in section [ sec : upper_bound ] and the lower bound in section [ sec : lower_bound ] .",

    "one of the main steps of our argument ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : drift_volume ] ) is to prove that , given two height functions @xmath730 , after a step of the ( fast ) dynamics the mutual volume has not increased in average .",
    "the proof of proposition [ prop : volume_drift ] shows that this is true ( for the hexagonal , square and square - hexagon graphs ) , _ independently of the boundary conditions _ ( in particular , for almost - planar conditions , independently of the slope @xmath145 ) _ and independently also of the presence of floor / ceiling constraints_. while obtaining the mixing time upper bound of order @xmath688 requires considerable extra work , the volume decrease result implies rather directly @xcite that the mixing time is at most polynomial in @xmath9 , since ( i ) the maximal volume difference between two configurations is of order @xmath731 and ( ii ) the ratio of mixing times of the fast and original dynamics is at most polynomial in @xmath9 .",

    "recently , it was proved in @xcite that , when a floor at height zero is present ( i.e. when heights are constrained to be non - negative ) the mixing time of the glauber dynamics for the sos model is exponentially large in @xmath9 .",
    "this effect is due to the rigidity of the interface _ and _ to the presence of the floor , which pushes the interface to a height of order @xmath46 ( entropic repulsion @xcite ) . if a `` gaseous '' phase does behave like a sos interface , which is very likely , then that the dimer dynamics for the square - octagon graph with almost - planar b.c . of @xmath163 slope and floor at height zero",
    "has also a mixing time growing exponentially with @xmath9 . as a consequence ,",
    "for the reasons exposed above , the volume decrease can not hold as stated in proposition [ prop : volume_drift ] ( i.e. for general floor / ceiling constraint and boundary condition ) for the square - octagon graph ( it can not be true that the mutual volume between two arbitrary height functions decreases on average , under some reasonable `` fast dynamics '' , for the square - octagon graph with general boundary conditions and floor / ceiling constraints ) . if on the other hand the volume decrease holds only for particular boundary conditions and floor / ceiling , then the mathematical mechanism for that must be considerably more subtle than in proposition [ prop : volume_drift ] .      in this section",
