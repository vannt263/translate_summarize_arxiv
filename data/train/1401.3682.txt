    "the study of quantum channel networks has become more and more important in the last few years .    some of the first applications of this will be secret key transmission / generation and transmitting of secure messages over quantum networks .",
    "the capacities for secret key transmission / generation and the secrecy capacities for message transmission have been determined in @xcite and @xcite .    for these applications , the transmitters have to solve two main problems .",
    "first , the message ( a secret key or a secure message ) has to be encoded in such a way that it can be decoded correctly by the legal receiver .",
    "second , the message has to be encoded such that the wiretapper s knowledge of the transmitted classical message can be kept arbitrarily small .",
    "transmission of secret keys and secure messages over long distances is an essential requirement for those applications .",
    "thus , in our paper , we consider the problem how to ensure that the legal receivers are able to reproduce the original messages .",
    "this is a necessary condition for reliable secret key transmissions / generations and transmitting of secure messages over quantum networks .",
    "the problem of long - distance transmissions of quantum information is one of the biggest problems in the realization of quantum networks .",
    "the sending of photons in optical fibers is presently limited by 200 km because of losses in the optical - fiber channel due to absorption on the way .",
    "one solution to solve this problem is the development of quantum repeaters ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the practical realization of this component is not given until now .",
    "the researchers already built quantum repeaters in their laboratories , but until now it is not possible to extend the limit of 200 km .    in this paper",
    ", we use a relay instead of a quantum repeater .",
    "the advantage of this protocol is that it is realizable and enables quantum communication between two parties over the double length of the distance for sending photons in optical fibers .",
    "this protocol can also be used for free space optical communications between satellites .",
    "the communications in several classical practical applications such as satellite communication and cellular communication are modeled with channels with relay nodes .",
    "channel networks with relay nodes have been studied extensively in the context of classical information theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the study of quantum channels with relay nodes has just recently begun ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    we analyze a quantum channel network model which was introduced for classical channel networks in @xcite .",
    "it is called the two - phase bidirectional relaying channel ( figure [ bidirelpic ] ) . in this model",
    "we consider a three - node quantum network with two message sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is called a two - user bidirectional quantum channel .",
    "the message @xmath2 is located at node  @xmath3 , and the message @xmath4 is located at node  @xmath5 , respectively , while a relay node enables the bidirectional communication between these nodes .",
    "we assume that the relay node can not transmit and receive data at the same time .",
    "this is usually called a half - duplex relay .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for practical components in communication systems in general .",
    "our goal is that after the transmission the message @xmath2 is known at node  @xmath5 and the message @xmath4 is known at node  @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we simplify the problem by assuming an a priori separation of the communication into two phases .",
    "there exist several strategies which are usually classified by the process at the relay node , namely the entanglement swapping - and - forward strategy ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the decode - and - forward strategy .",
    "we consider a two - phase decode - and - forward protocol .",
    "the relay node s task is to decode the messages that it receives in the first phase and to forward the information to its destinations in the second phase .",
    "this basically means that in the first phase the relay measures and decodes and that in the second phase the relay prepares and encodes .",
    "the disadvantage of this strategy is that the coherence is destroyed .",
    "the advantage of this strategy is that in the second phase each receiver can use its own message from the first phase as side information to gather a higher capacity .",
    "the goal of the communication is the transmission of classical signals , between two partners .",
    "the problem of the optimal transmission of these classical signals can be divided into two parts :    1 .",
    "quantum modulation ( i.e. , choosing an optimal set of possible input states which will be the input alphabet .",
    "this is equivalent to consider a special classical - quantum channel , i.e. , a quantum channel depending on the set of chosen input states whose sender s inputs are classical variables . )",
    "optimal coding for the classical - quantum channel .",
    "we also consider this problem because the model of classical - quantum channels is a very important tool for understanding the capacity formulas for quantum channels .",
    "the capacity of classical - quantum channels has been determined in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it turns out that classical - quantum channels are not only of theoretical interest , but as well as of technical interest , too ; for instance , a code for a classical - quantum channel can be used for entanglement generation ( cf .",
    "furthermore , new phenomenons such as super - additivity and super - activation appear for carrying classical information through a quantum channel ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we would like to point out that the three - node bidirectional relay network is an extremely advantageous tool in the relay network theory .",
    "the model of classical three - node bidirectional relay network has been extended to more complex models such as mimo channels ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , gaussian channels ( @xcite ) , polar codes ( @xcite ) , and cross - layer designs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in view of these previous works on the classical bidirectional relay network",
    ", our further tasks will be to analyze these models for quantum networks ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .    for classical models , the authors of @xcite use results from coding theory for degraded broadcast channel ( cf .",
    "one of our major challenges in this paper is that there are no equivalent tools in the quantum information theory yet .",
    "thus , we can only establish the capacity region with average errors , but not the capacity region with maximal errors as in the classical case ( cf . remark [ avemax ] ) .",
    "it still reminds open how the capacity region with maximal errors can be established .",
    "recent research has been done toward security for classical bidirectional relay networks ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is a promising task to find similar results for quantum networks .",
    "another important basic feature for classical bidirectional relay networks is the channel uncertainty ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the capacity for quantum channels with uncertainty has been determined in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the design of communication protocols for quantum networks is a challenging task . for the design of efficient protocols , it is important to incorporate side information into the coding schemes . in this paper , we considered the case where both receivers have side information about the messages .",
    "@xcite considered recently the case where the transmitter has side information about the channel state .",
    "this corresponds to the classical `` writing on dirty paper '' coding .",
    "this coding strategy plays an important role in modern communication systems .",
    "it is an interesting research topic to develop on the basic of @xcite and the bidirectional relaying protocol of this paper for more complicated quantum networks .",
    "the study of relay channels in the quantum scenario is novel .",
    "we hope our results may raise interests in further analysis .",
    "by the separation of the communication , we have a multiple - access phase , where node  @xmath3 and node  @xmath5 transmit messages @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the relay node , and a broadcast phase , where the relay forwards the messages to node  @xmath5 and node  @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we look at the two phases separately .        in the multiple - access phase",
    ", we have a classical - quantum multiple - access channel .",
    "the multiple - access channel is a channel such that two ( or more ) senders send information to a common receiver via this channel .",
    "the optimal coding strategies and capacity regions for classical multiple - access channels have been given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the optimal coding strategies and capacity regions for multiple - access quantum channels have been given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in the broadcast phase , we have a broadcast quantum channel . in a broadcast channel",

    "the optimal coding strategies and capacity regions for classical broadcast channels have been given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "an optimal coding strategy and a capacity region for broadcast quantum channels have been given in @xcite .",
    "for the broadcast phase , we assume that the relay node has successfully decoded the messages @xmath7 and @xmath6 in the multiple - access phase .",
    "of course , the message @xmath6 is also known at node  @xmath3 and the message @xmath6 is also known at node  @xmath5 . the goal of the relay node is to broadcast a message to node  @xmath3 and node  @xmath5 which allows both nodes to recover the unknown source .",
    "this means that node  @xmath3 wants to recover message @xmath7 and that node  @xmath5 wants to recover message @xmath6 .      for finite - dimensional complex hilbert spaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 , a quantum channel @xmath10 : @xmath11 , @xmath12",
    "is represented by a completely positive trace - preserving map that accepts input quantum states in @xmath13 and produces output quantum states in @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath13 stands for the space of density operators on the space @xmath8 .",
    "if the sender wants to transmit a classical message of a finite set @xmath15 to the receiver using a quantum channel @xmath10 , his encoding procedure will include a classical - to - quantum encoder to prepare a quantum message state @xmath16 suitable as an input for the channel .",
    "if the sender s encoding is restricted to transmit an indexed finite set of quantum states @xmath17 , then we can consider the choice of the signal quantum states @xmath18 as a component of the channel .",
