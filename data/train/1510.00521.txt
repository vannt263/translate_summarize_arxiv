    "in general , to study algebraic properties of a polynomially nonlinear system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) , the system has to be completed to involution  @xcite .",
    "in particular , by such completion one can check the consistency of the system , detect arbitrariness in its analytical solution , eliminate a subset of dependent variables , and verify whether some another pde is a differential consequence of the system , i.e. verify whether this pde vanishes on all solutions of the system .",
    "however , algorithmically , a polynomially nonlinear pde system may not admit completion .",
    "instead , one can decompose such a system into finitely many involutive subsystems with disjoint sets of solutions .",
    "this is done by the thomas decomposition  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply first the differential thomas decomposition to the equation system which comprises four linear pdes in two independent and six dependent variables and also two quadratically nonlinear algebraic relations in the dependent variables .",
    "this partial differential - algebraic system is a parameter - free subsystem of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional kirchhoff equation . in doing so",
    ", we detect the arbitrariness in the general ( analytical ) solution to that subsystem .",
    "then , by applying the classical theorem about conservative vector fields  @xcite and performing integration by parts we reduce the parameter - free subsystem to a system of three nonlinear pdes in two independent variables that contains one arbitrary function .    as the next step , we perform the computer algebra based lie symmetry analysis to the reduced system and discover that this system is equivalent ( modulo lie group transformations ) to another system of three nonlinear pdes in two independent variables @xmath0 and two dependent variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the last system comprises two equations of zero gaussian curvature for the surfaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 and one more equation that relates @xmath1 and @xmath2 . to construct the solution of the system we use the classical parametrization of a zero curvature surface  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we obtain a closed - form analytical solution to the parameter - free subsystem under consideration and prove that the solution is general .",
    "this opens up a wide range for application of symbolic - numeric methods to the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional kirchhoff equation .",
    "all symbolic computations related to the construction of the general analytical solution were done with maple .    on that basis , we derive a combined analytical and numerical scheme to solve the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional kirchhoff equation .",
    "this system of partial differential and algebraic equations describes the dynamic equilibrium of one - dimensional continua like slender structures , artificial fibers , human hair , cilia and flagella .",
    "since their dynamical behavior act on different time - scales , numerical stiffness enters the problem and leads to huge instabilities in the case of basic purely numerical solution schemes . to prevent that",
    ", we exploit the explicit analytical expressions found for the solution to the parameter - free subsystem . in so doing , we set up the arbitrary functions in the exact solution according to the numerical solution of the kirchhoff equation .",
    "in contrast to a purely numerical handling , this reduces the numerical solution space and prevents the kirchhoff system from becoming unstable .",
    "the advantage is demonstrated by simulating a cilia carpet .    in",
    "this regard our specific contributions are as follows .    1 .",
    "first we derive a suitable formulation of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional differential kirchhoff equation from the cosserat equation and study the parameter - free subsystem of the resulting system using computer algebra - based methods and software .",
    "then we find a closed form analytical solution to the parameter - free subsystem that depends on four parametrization functions . 3 .   on the basis of results 1 and 2 ,",
    "we construct a combined analytical and numerical scheme to solve the full ( 1 + 1)-dimensional kirchhoff equation .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the advantage of our method by simulating a cilia carpet and compare the results with a purely numerical handling .",
    "for a detailed derivation of the special cosserat theory of rods , we refer to our last year s contribution @xcite . according to the formulation presented in there , the rods in classical cosserat theory",
    "can undergo shear and extension .",
    "we can avoid this by setting the linear strains to @xmath5 in local coordinates .",
    "geometrically this means , that the angle between the director @xmath6 and the tangent to the centerline , @xmath7 , always remains zero ( no shear ) and that the tangent to the centerline always has unit length ( no elongation ) .",
    "we further reduce the system to two dimensions by setting @xmath8 .",
    "finally we separate the resulting equations into two pde subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 and additionally a set of constraints @xmath11 with an antidiagonal matrix @xmath12 please note , that the equations  ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : parameterfreesystem2 ] ) are parameter free , whereas equations  ( [ eqn : mainsystem1])([eqn : mainsystem2 ] ) include parameters @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we derive an exact analytical solution to ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : parameterfreesystem2 ] ) under the constraints ( [ eqn : constraint1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) .      to determine the functional arbitrariness in the general analytical solution to equations  ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) with non - vanishing values of the dependent variables , we apply to them the differential thomas decomposition  @xcite by using its implementation in maple .",
    "] under the choice of a degree - reverse - lexicographical ranking with @xmath14    then , under the condition @xmath15 , the decomposition algorithm outputs two involutive differential systems .",

    "i.e. , the highest ranking derivatives occurring in the equations .",
    "the second involutive system in the output contains the equation @xmath18 which has no real solution under our assumption of non - vanishing dependent variables .    the differential dimensional polynomial  @xcite computed for the left - hand sides of the above equation system @xmath19 shows that the general analytical solution depends on three arbitrary functions of one variable .

    "remark : arbitrariness ] in the below described procedure , to construct a solution to  ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) we have to solve a number of intermediate partial differential equations . in doing so",

    "there exist functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 such that @xmath32 if one takes into account these relations , then the application of the same theorem to the equations ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem2 ] ) transforms them into the equivalent form @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are some functions .    therefore , the parameter - free system ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) is equivalent to ( i.e. it has the same solution space as ) the following system of two nonlinear pdes : @xmath36 here and below we use the notation : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , et cetera .",
    "we look for a solution of ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) such that @xmath40 the equations ( [ eq1fg])([eq2fg ] ) form a linear system in @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it has non - trivial solutions only if @xmath43 what is equivalent to the equality @xmath44 that follows from ( [ eqn : constraint1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) .",
    "obviously , equation ( [ eq3fg ] ) admits an integration by parts which yields @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an arbitrary function .",
    "therefore , the system ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) is equivalent to the system @xmath47    now we apply the thomas decomposition algorithm in its implementation in maple  @xcite for the differential elimination of the function @xmath1 from the system ( [ eq : fg])([eq : fgc ] ) and independently the differential elimination of the function @xmath2 from the same system . in doing so",

    "now we can formulate and prove one of the main theoretical results of the present paper .",

    "it means that the surface @xmath3 has zero gaussian curvature .",
    "such surfaces are locally isometric to a plane and admit a parametrization constructed in the classical paper  @xcite . in the following subsection we use this parametrization to derive the general analytical solution to ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) .      in  @xcite a parametric form of a general analytical solution to an isolated zero curvature equation was found . for equation  ( [ eq : fgaussian ] )",

    "our assumption allows to express the parameter @xmath80 linearly in terms of @xmath75 and leads to a rather compact parametrization of functions @xmath81 of the form @xmath82 with six functions .",
    "however , these functions are not arbitrary . by taking the first and second order derivatives of both sides in the equality @xmath83 with respect to @xmath75 and @xmath74 we obtain a linear equation system in @xmath84 .",

    "similarly , equation ( [ eq : ggaussian ] ) is rewritten as two differential equalities @xmath89 with unspecified @xmath90 .",
    "next , equation  ( [ eq : fgconstraint ] ) implies the algebraic equality @xmath91 or equivalently @xmath92 with arbitrary @xmath93 .    as the next step",
    ", we apply the following transformation of the independent variables , which are inverse to ( [ transformation ] ) : @xmath94 with @xmath95 . for this purpose",
    ", we use the relations @xmath96 together with ( [ eq : forf ] ) , ( [ eq : forg ] ) , and ( [ eq : forfg ] ) to compute all partial derivatives of the functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 with respect to @xmath97 and @xmath23 that occur in ( [ eqsgreen1 ] ) and ( [ eqsgreen2 ] ) .",
    "this gives the analytical solution : @xmath98 here @xmath99 are arbitrary analytical functions of one variable , @xmath100 is an arbitrary analytical function of the argument @xmath101 , and the prime mark denotes differentiation of a function with respect of its argument .    substituting ( [ eqn : solution ] ) in equations ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) shows that these equations are satisfied for any functions @xmath102 . in section  [ sec : functionalarbitrariness ] we saw that the general analytical solution depends on three arbitrary functions , each of one variable .",
    "the following theorem shows that the functional arbitrariness in ( [ eqn : solution ] ) is superfluous .",
    "set @xmath103 in ( [ eqn : solution ] ) .",
    "then the analytical solution @xmath104 to ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) is general .",
    "assume without loss of generality that the initial point is @xmath105 and pose the cauchy problem for ( [ eqn : parameterfreesystem1])([eqn : constraint2 ] ) in a vicinity of this point .",
    "then the well - posed cauchy problem reads ( see remark [ remark : cauchy ] ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 are analytic functions and @xmath108 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "substitution of ( [ eqn : gensolution ] ) into ( [ cauchyproblem ] ) implies equations @xmath109 now we aim to show that for any predetermined functions satisfying @xmath110 it is always possible to match up functions @xmath111 such that in a vicinity of @xmath112 solution ( [ eqn : gensolution ] ) satisfy the initial data ( [ cauchyproblem ] ) .",
    "the squared second equation in ( [ eqsforf ] ) divided by the third equation gives the equality @xmath113 which together with the first and third equations in ( [ eqsforf ] ) implies @xmath114 if @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , then in some vicinity of zero the problem ( [ newcauchy ] ) has the unique solution .",

    "the substitution of the equations  ( [ eqn : gensolution ] ) into the equations  ( [ eqn : mainsystem1])([eqn : mainsystem2 ] ) , the replacement of the spatial derivatives with central differences , and the replacement of the temporal derivatives according to the numerical scheme of a forward euler integrator , leads to an explicit expression .",
    "iterating over this recurrence equation allows for the simulation of the dynamics of a kirchhoff rod .",
    "we present this in the context of the simulation of the beating pattern of a cilium .",
    "such kind of scenarios are of interest in the context of simulations in biology and biophysics , since this kind of patterns occur widely in nature .",
    "for example cilia carpets in the interior of the lung are responsible for the mucus transport , see @xcite . the results are shown in figure  [ fig : beatingpattern ] .",
    "compared to a purely numerical handling using a discretization of the equations ( [ eqn : mainsystem1])([eqn : parameterfreesystem2 ] ) in a similar way , the step size can be increased by three orders of magnitude , which leads to an acceleration of two orders of magnitude .",
    "this is of special interest for complex systems like cilia carpets , in which multiple cilia are beating in parallel with phase differences in order to produce the appearance of a wave .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : beatingpattern ] .",
    "in this contribution , we have studied the two - dimensional kirchhoff system . to prevent from numerical problems which result from the numerical stiffness of the underlying differential equations",
    ", we developed a combined , partially symbolic and partially numeric , integration scheme . within the symbolic part we constructed an explicit analytical solution to the parameter - free part of kirchhoff system and proved that this solution is general .",
    "the application of the analytical solution prevents from numerical instabilities and allows for highly accurate and efficient simulations .",
    "this was demonstrated for the scenario of a cilia carpet , which could be efficiently simulated two orders of magnitude faster compared to a purely numerical handling .",
