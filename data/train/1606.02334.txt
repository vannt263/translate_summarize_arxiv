    "if overlying fields are preventing the cme from ever reaching super - alfvnic speeds , or if the densities are being changed in some unknown manner , then no shock will ever form to result in the type ii burst required for detection .",
    "finally , it is assumed that when a cme has occurred that has created a type ii burst , that the burst is detectible . as discussed in section [ lims ] ,",
    "the signal is dependent on the frequency , brightness temperature @xmath28 , and the angular size @xmath29 .",
    "conditions could be such that any cmes released are only generating mhd shocks further away from the base of the stellar corona resulting in type ii bursts at frequencies below the magnetospheric cutoff and would be undetectable using ground based observatories .",
    "another reasonable alternative is that the brightness temperature and/or the angular size are too small to produce a detectable signal .",
    "it may be the case that the shocks are all very bright but so angularly small that they still are undetectable , or the reverse case that they cover quite a large area but are too cold to be seen .",
    "on the sun , flares and cmes are closely related phenomena ; they both occur as the result of magnetic reconnection and manifest together in eruptive events .",
    "magnetic reconnection occurs when highly stressed and opposing magnetic field lines are pressed together .",
    "the field lines break and reconnect into a new configuration allowing the release of energy and/or mass .",
    "@xcite showed that x - ray solar flare energies above 10@xmath15 erg in the goes bandpass ( 1 - 8  ) have a 100% correspondence between solar flares and cmes .",
    "flares occurring on m dwarfs typically have energies between @xmath77 to @xmath78 erg and have mean flare rates that are 10@xmath79 - 10@xmath80 times higher than on the sun @xcite . assuming the relationship holds for m dwarfs",
    ", this would imply a large number of m dwarf flares would have the 100% correspondence of flares to cmes .",
    "what type of characteristics will this associated cme have for a flare of a certain energy ?",
    "physically driven arguments show that in the solar case there is a rough equipartition between the total radiated energy of the flare and the mechanical energy of its associated cme @xcite .",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 is the fraction of the bolometric flare emission appropriate for the waveband in which the energy of the flare is being measured . in this case , @xmath83 for a u - band ( 300 - 430 nm ) optical observation @xcite , @xmath84 is a constant of proportionality @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the velocity of the cme , @xmath87 is the total mass of the cme , and @xmath88 is the radiated optical flare energy in the u - band .    given a measured flare energy , and this relation , there still exists a mass - velocity degeneracy for a cme occurring with a flare .",
    "however , radio measurements of the cme provide a velocity constraint which can be used to break the degeneracy . assuming this solar relation holds for the stellar case , a method for constraining cme mass , that was previously impossible using radio observations alone , is obtained .",

    "there are large uncertainties in estimating mass from flare energies using equations ( [ eq:5 ] ) or ( [ eq : empirical ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath96 and @xmath97 together give about 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes spread .",
    "therefore , its success may be limited when examining events individually , but it should have more so when dealing with larger quantities of detections or while searching for average @xmath87 .    in future experiments ,",
    "a solar scaling test is to verify that equations [ eq : equipar ] and [ eq : empirical ] provide consistent results for @xmath87 .",
    "this test may bolster or refute the assumption that the solar scaling relations extend to the stellar case .",
    "assuming the test holds , equations [ eq : equipar ] and [ eq : empirical ] may be utilized to solve for flare energy as a function of cme velocity . @xmath98^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}\\ ] ] .",

    "simultaneous observations of radio and optical frequencies are required to evaluate this equation .",
    "the radio observations are able to provide drift rates of putative type ii bursts produced by the cmes , and thus velocity constraints .",
    "optical u - band observations are able to measure the associated flare energy .    equations ( [ eq : equipar ] ) , ( [ eq : empirical ] ) , and ( [ eq : combined ] ) provide a theoretical answer to the question of what type of characteristics will this associated cme have for a flare of a certain energy? for this analysis , it is assumed that a detectable shock is caused by a cme traveling with a velocity slightly above the alfvn speed generating an mhd shock in the traditional manner .",
    "this method will provide a theoretical lower bound of flare energy required by a flare to produce a shock as it is just above the threshold of shock formation . here",
    "the alfvn speed is represented with @xmath100 where b is the magnetic field strength and n is the local electron density .",
    "assuming that the type ii burst is slightly super - alfvnic ( @xmath101 ) and thus able to create a type ii shock , the minimum energy required by the associated flare can be estimated .",
    "@xcite suggests that solar type ii shocks preferentially form near the solar surface ( @xmath8 1 - 2 r@xmath12 ) , and @xcite suggest that the entirety of the shock surface may be super - alfvnic at early phases ( 2 - 4 r@xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore , it will be assumed initially that a shock will form at @xmath102 .",
    "using typical numbers for m dwarfs at the base of the corona of @xmath103 @xmath10 and b@xmath104 g @xcite , the minimum flare energy becomes @xmath105 erg .",

    "the minimum energy to shock is very sensitive to the initial conditions @xmath108 and @xmath109",

    "the sensitivity to stellar parameters can be shown .",
    "a yz cmi type star with a type ii burst emitting in lofar s observing frequency range",
    "would be fully covering the parameter space ( green and teal regions been the lines of constant frequency of 10 and190 mhz for a constant energy of @xmath130 ergs ) .",
    "alternatively , a star similar to yz cmi but with 1/3 the base coronal density and 3 times the magnetic field strength with a type ii burst emitting in lofar s observing frequencies would have a signal that would be completely outside of the parameter space ( gray and dark gray regions ) that lofar would be able to cover . here",
    "the gray and dark gray regions do not extend down to the @xmath130 ergs energy region between the lines of constant frequency 10 and 190 mhz and thus would be unable to detect cmes corresponding to a flare with this energy .",
    "a star with low densities and strong magnetic fields may not produce an observable shock with a flare of certain energy while a star with high density and weak magnetic fields would produce a detectable shock off an identical flare .",
    "preferential stars to observe for shocks are those stars with lower magnetic field strengths and higher coronal electron densities while keeping high flare rates .",
    "this predicts detectable drift rates of @xmath131 mhz / s .",

    "this creates the potential for several orders of magnitude uncertainty in either directions about any specific measurement . since the empirical relations in @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide consistent values for cme mass , even given wide spread , a large number of dual measurements are needed to test accurately the validity of solar - stellar scaling .",
    "the observations presented in table 1 have yielded no plausible detections of drifting low - frequency ( type ii ) radio bursts on yz cmi and thus no cme detections either . assuming the rate of shocks is a lower limit to the rate at which cmes occur , no detections in a total of 15 hours of observation places a limit of @xmath133 shocks / hr @xmath1 for yz cmi due to the stochastic nature of the events and limits of observational sensitivity .",
    "this rate is for the frequency range between 30 - 160 mhz , at the sensitivities stated above , assuming the rate of shocks is less than or equal to the rate of cmes . due to the lack of detections , and the exploratory nature of this paper , no rigorous constraints can yet be placed on whether flares on m dwarfs have cmes .",
    "a likely contributor to the lack of detections is that cmes producing a type ii shock in the correct parameter space also need to have a sufficiently high brightness temperature and/or large enough angular size to produce a flux density detectable by lofar .",
    "more sensitive observations ( with more stations ) and longer observation periods would increase the likelihood of detections .",
    "based on section [ methodologyforconnection ] , simultaneous observations between radio and u - band would allow for a deeper investigation of m dwarf cmes .",
    "stars with weaker magnetic field strengths and higher electron densities of the corona while maintaining high flare rates are preferred for type ii burst detections .",
    "weaker flares are related to slower cmes via equation ( [ eq : combined ] ) .",
    "this means that the observable drift rates are slower due to the shock forming further away from the star .",
    "generating high drift rate shocks require shock formation closer to the star in its higher density regions and require more energy reducing the frequency of occurrence .",
    "simultaneous observation provides direct flare measurements which would allow for cme property predictions that could be tested against cme detections if found .",
    "given the assumptions and limitations of this current dataset , rigorous limits can not yet be placed on the occurrence and properties of stellar cme s .",
