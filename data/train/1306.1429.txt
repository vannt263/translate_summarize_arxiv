    "the availability of oriented molecules provides a wealth of intriguing applications in a variety of molecular sciences , such as in chemical reaction dynamics  @xcite , photoelectron angular distributions  @xcite , or high - order harmonic generation  @xcite .",
    "an oriented molecule is characterized by the confinement of the molecular fixed axes along the laboratory fixed axes and by its dipole moment pointing in a particular direction .",
    "many experimental efforts have been undertaken to control the rotational degree of freedom , and in particular to orient polar molecules  @xcite .    here",
    ", we focus on a theoretical study of the mixed - field orientation technique , which is based on the combination of weak dc and strong non - resonant radiative fields  @xcite . strongly oriented / antioriented states could be created by coupling the nearly degenerate pair of states with opposite parity forming a pendular doublet by means of a weak dc field .",
    "this theoretical prediction is based on an adiabatic picture in which the turn - on time of the laser pulse is larger than the molecular rotational period  @xcite . for asymmetric top molecules ,",
    "a theoretical study based on a time - independent model of their mixed - field orientation pointed out that a fully adiabatic description of this process does not reproduce the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "we have recently found that a time - dependent description of the mixed - field orientation of linear molecules is required to explain the experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "two main sources of non - adiabatic effects were identified for linear molecules : i ) the coupling of the levels forming quasidegenerate pendular doublets as the laser intensity is increased gives rise to a transfer of population between them ; ii ) the strongly coupled states from the same @xmath0 manifold for tilted fields are driven apart as the laser intensity is increased in the weak - field regime , provoking a population redistribution among them .",
    "in addition , for highly excited states , avoided crossing in the field - dressed spectrum could affect the rotational dynamics .",
    "a similar time - dependent study for polar asymmetric top molecules is desirable for a correct interpretation of the numerous mixed - field experiments with these systems  @xcite . compared to linear molecules ,",
    "asymmetric tops possess a more dense level structure and , when the fields are turned on these levels could be strongly coupled .",
    "thus , a more complex rotational dynamics should be expected for asymmetric tops in combined dc and ac fields .",
    "let us also mention that several theoretical and experimental studies have investigated the relevance of non - adiabatic phenomena on the manipulation of molecules with external fields  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we perform a theoretical investigation of the rotational dynamics of an asymmetric top in parallel electric and non - resonant radiative fields within the rigid rotor description .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation is solved using experimental field configurations , i.e. , first a weak electric field that is switched on at a constant speed and then a parallel linearly polarized gaussian laser pulse is turned on . for several rotational states ,",
    "we show that under ns - pulses the dynamics is not adiabatic and it is characterized by the formation of the pendular doublets and the numerous avoided crossings of the field - dressed spectrum .",
    "we have proven that due the different time scales associated to each phenomenon , it might become experimentally harder to reach the adiabatic limit .",
    "increasing the electric field strength helps for the lowest - lying state in a certain irreducible representation ; whereas for an excited one a proper combination of dc field with the temporal width of the pulse is needed to optimize the mixed - field orientation process .",

    "the turning on speed is chosen so that this process is adiabatic . here",
    ", we work in the weak or moderate dc - field regime .",

    "note that the adiabatic value is independent of @xmath58 .",
    "an important feature of this state is that using weak dc fields , the dynamics is not adiabatic even if the fwhm is increased up to @xmath153  ns .",
    "this lack of adiabaticity is again explained in terms of the rotational dynamics through the avoided crossings .",
    "the avoided crossing involving the adiabatic states @xmath158 and @xmath156 is crossed diabatically even for @xmath45  ns and @xmath164 .",

    "we have encountered only a few rotational states , such as @xmath78@xmath50 and @xmath104@xmath50 , for which the field - dressed dynamics is dominated by the formation of the pendular pairs . for other states ,",
    "the dynamics is more complicated because the time evolution of their wave function is strongly affected by the avoided crossings . at the ac field regime where the pendular doublets are",
    "formed , the presence of additional avoided crossings provokes the interaction between three or even more adiabatic levels .",
    "in such a region , the complexity of these avoided crossings prevent us from using the landau - zener criteria or a two state model to analyze the rotational dynamics through them .",

    "we have shown that dc fields with strengths up to @xmath165 do not ensure an adiabatic dynamics for low - lying rotational states .",
    "thus , the path to the adiabaticity necessitates laser pulses with longer temporal widths . due to the different time scales associated to both phenomena , the pendular doublet formation and avoided crossings ,",
    "the field configuration required to achieve an adiabatic dynamics simultaneously for many rotational states becomes harder to produce experimentally .",
    "a laser pulse could be designed with a small slope of the intensity in the field regime where most of the avoided crossings appear and pendular doublet are formed , trying to minimize the population redistribution at that region . so that , the degree of adiabaticity could be significantly enhanced .    in this work ,",
    "we have analyzed the field - dressed dynamics of benzonitrile , but the above - observed physical phenomena are expected to occur in other polar asymmetric top molecules . due to the complex structure of these systems , a similar theoretical study should be performed for each specific molecule .",
    "the field regime under which the adiabatic dynamics would be achieved strongly depends on the rotational constant , the polarizability tensor and the permanent dipole moment",

    "the complexity of the field - dressed level structure is enhanced due to the presence of avoided crossings between states having different field - free magnetic quantum numbers . due to this new source of non - adiabatic effects , the degree of orientation in non - parallel dc and ac fields could be reduced . in this work",
    ", we have shown that for parallel fields , the avoided crossing among states with the same symmetry are passed , in general , diabatically for many field configurations .",
