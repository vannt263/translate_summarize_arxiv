    "collisions of heavy nuclei at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory produce a quark - gluon plasma , which is a fundamentally new strongly coupled state of partonic matter  @xcite .",
    "there is extensive experimental evidence that partons lose energy while traversing the hot medium  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies have been performed to determine the role of gluon radiation and collisional energy loss processes  @xcite , as well as to confront the data with predictions based upon ads / cft  @xcite .",
    "the fate of a higher mass quark traversing the plasma can help elucidate the mechanism of the energy loss , as the quark mass affects gluon radiation in the medium  @xcite .",
    "consequently , single electrons and positrons from the decays of mesons containing heavy quarks have been studied in various systems at both rhic @xcite and the large hadron collider at cern @xcite .",
    "differentiating among theoretical descriptions of the energy loss will be aided by comparing charm and bottom yields . in order to observe quark - gluon plasma effects on heavy quarks , it is crucial to compare au@xmath2au data to a baseline measurement not dominated by the plasma . typically collisions are used to provide this baseline .",
    "there are also effects of cold nuclear matter on the production of heavy quarks , which can be studied by comparing to @xmath7@xmath2pb or @xmath1@xmath2au .",
    "phenix has already reported modification in cold nuclear matter of single electrons at moderate @xmath8 @xcite , heavy flavor measured through @xmath9-@xmath10 correlations @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "of course , the bound state can be broken up in cold nuclear matter , so the and production cross sections in are of interest .",
    "clean c / b separation is difficult to achieve with single lepton measurements , as the single lepton spectrum contains both charm and bottom contributions .",
    "the b decay contribution increases with @xmath8 , and is comparable to the d decay contribution at @xmath12 3 gev/@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "phenix performed initial measurements of the charm and bottom cross sections in collisions via high mass dielectrons @xcite and electron - hadron correlations @xcite .",
    "star also reported a cross section in collisions @xcite measured through single electron spectra .",
    "reconstructing heavy flavor hadrons or measuring leptons with displaced vertices allows more direct separation of charm and bottom . however , such measurements require microvertex detectors or large data sets into a very large aperture with high resolution hadron identification .",
    "phenix has a new silicon microvertex detector , but no @xmath14au data have been collected with it yet .",
    "dielectron spectra , which are double differential in mass and @xmath8 , allow separation of regions dominated by charm from those dominated by bottom .",
    "the yield and shape of the mass and @xmath8 spectra provide sensitivity to the heavy flavor cross sections .",
    "furthermore , the spectra can also encode information about the heavy flavor production mechanism via the dielectron correlations , which affect the detected pair mass and @xmath8 and therefore the spectral shape .",
    "initial - state effects such as gluon shadowing in the nucleus may affect heavy quark cross sections as the dominant production channel at rhic is gluon fusion .",
    "the shape of the mass and @xmath8 distributions of charm and bottom decay electrons could additionally be sensitive to other effects , such as parton energy loss and rescattering in cold nuclear matter , for which evidence was recently reported @xcite .",
    "while azimuthal correlations of the two leptons have advantages for studying the heavy - quark production process  @xcite , analysis of dileptons as a function of mass and is undertaken in order to separate charm and bottom contributions .    in this paper",
    "we report a high statistics measurement of dielectrons in collisions in order to provide part of the necessary baseline information for quark - gluon plasma studies .",
    "section ii describes the experimental apparatus and trigger .",
    "section iii presents details about the data analysis , including electron identification , background subtraction , and efficiency corrections .",
    "the data are presented in section iv , as double differential spectra in mass and @xmath8 .",
    "expected sources of dielectrons , and effects of the phenix acceptance are also discussed in this section . in section v the results are compared to models of charm and bottom production to determine the heavy flavor cross sections and examine sensitivity to leading - order and next - to - leading - order quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) descriptions of heavy - flavor physics .",
    "section vi presents our summary and conclusions .",
    "the data reported in this paper were collected in the 2008 rhic run .",
    "the data were recorded by the phenix detector using both a minimum bias trigger and an electron trigger .",
    "a total of 3.1 billion triggered events were analyzed , corresponding to 116.6 billion sampled minimum bias events and an integrated luminosity of @xmath15b@xmath16 ( equivalent to a nucleon - nucleon @xmath17b@xmath16 ) .",
    "electrons are measured in phenix using the two central arm spectrometers , each covering @xmath18 0.35 and @xmath19 .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector is available in  @xcite .",
    "tracks are reconstructed using information from hits in the drift chambers ( dc ) and pad chambers .",
    "the magnitude of the particle s bend in the central axial magnetic field is determined from the reconstructed track and used to determine the track s momentum .",
    "the momentum resolution for this data set is @xmath20 = 0.011 @xmath21 0.0116@xmath7 , where p is in gev/@xmath13 .",
    "tracks are projected onto the photomultiplier tube plane of the ring - imaging erenkov counter ( rich ) .",
    "matched hits allow cuts on the ring shape and size to separate electrons from hadrons to approximately 5 gev/@xmath13 .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeters ( emcal ) measure the deposited energy and the shower shape .",
    "the ratio of the measured energy and momentum provides further electron identification  @xcite .",
    "the collision vertex , collision time , and minimum bias trigger are provided by a pair of beam - beam counters ( bbc ) located 144 cm from the center of phenix , on either side of the collision region .",
    "each bbc comprises 64 quartz erenkov counters and covers a rapidity range of 3.0 @xmath22 3.9 .",
    "the collision vertex resolution is approximately 0.5 cm in collisions .",
    "the minimum bias trigger requires a coincidence between north and south sides of the bbc , with at least one hit on each side and accepts the events if the bbc vertex is within 38 @xmath23 of the nominal interaction vertex .",
    "the minimum bias trigger is sensitive to @xmath24% of all collisions @xcite .",
    "collisions producing an electron - positron pair are extremely rare ; fewer than 1% of minimum bias triggered events contain a single electron ( @xmath25200 mev ) in the central arm acceptance .",
    "consequently , pairs exist in only a tiny fraction of the events .",
    "furthermore , pairs at high mass and high @xmath8 have cross sections many orders of magnitude smaller than pairs from vector meson decays . as a result ,",
    "electron triggered events are crucial for collecting a high statistics dielectron sample in .",
    "the phenix electron trigger requires a erenkov ring deposited in the rich that is spatially aligned with a shower in the emcal with energy above two thresholds of 600 and 800 mev .",
    "the bias of the resulting samples is corrected for the trigger efficiency using the ratio of electron triggered to minimum bias triggered events as a function of electron momentum .",
    "the minimum bias triggered data sample does not require any minimum energy threshold criterion .",
    "the single electron trigger threshold creates a mass threshold for electron pairs , and is corrected by comparing to minimum bias collisions double - differentially in mass and @xmath8 .",
    "data quality cuts include fiducial cuts to remove any detector edge effects or dead areas .",
    "the data were collected into run groups with similar detector performance characteristics .",
    "each group was analyzed separately , and the groups were combined after efficiency correction .",
    "electron candidates must pass track reconstruction quality cuts , have @xmath26 0.2 gev/@xmath13 , as well as fire the rich and emcal detectors . to be identified as an electron , each candidate",
    "must be associated with two or more fired rich photomultiplier tubes within the expected rich ring size and position . in the relatively low multiplicity @xmath27au collisions ,",
    "this is the main discriminating cut using the rich .",
    "electrons are also required to have a good match to an emcal cluster . for further electron identification",
    ", the energy in the emcal must satisfy the requirement @xmath28 0.5 .",
    "the electron purity is approximately 85 - 90% .",
    "finally , to fully control the kinematic edge of the single electron @xmath29 cut , the pair @xmath30 is required to be greater than 450  mev/@xmath13 .",
    "photon conversions in detector support structures are identified in the two - dimensional plane of dc hit azimuthal angle vs. @xmath31 .",
    "conversion electrons traverse a portion of the magnetic field and , consequently , their momentum and , therefore , their @xmath31 is mismeasured .",
    "fully reconstructed conversions in the beam pipe and air before the dc are removed by a cut on a pairwise variable , @xmath32 , defined as    @xmath33    here @xmath34 is the 3-momentum vector of the electron and @xmath35 the 3-momentum vector of the positron .",
    "this is a cut on the orientation of the plane defined by the opening angle of the pair with respect to the magnetic field , which is parallel to the beam axis @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 pairs from photon conversions have no intrinsic opening angle .",
    "therefore , the only way they can be separated from each other is by the magnetic field pulling them apart . in this case",
    ", the opening angle will be aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field . however",
    ", any pair that decays from a source with mass must have an opening angle that is randomly oriented with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "for @xmath38600 mev / c@xmath39 , this cut removes 98% of the conversions while retaining 80% of the signal pairs . at higher pair mass where the heavy flavor spectrum dominates ,",
    "conversions are negligible and this cut does not affect the signal efficiency .    an additional source of contamination in the dielectron spectrum is due to hadron tracks that share a rich ring with an electron",
    ". the sharing can not be properly reproduced by event - mixing , so this contamination must be removed before background subtraction . as like - sign electron - hadron pairs populate a different region in mass and @xmath8 from unlike - sign pairs , like - sign subtraction also can not be used to remove this contamination .",
    "consequently , a cut is placed on the distance between the projection of any two tracks onto the rich photomultiplier tube plane .",
    "if the projections are within 10 @xmath40 in @xmath41 ( this corresponds @xmath42 36 @xmath23 , roughly twice the predicted maximum diameter of a rich ring ) , then the entire event is rejected .",
    "this cut does not affect the mass spectrum above @xmath43  mev/@xmath44 and removes less than 1% of the events .",
    "all electrons and positrons in a given event are combined into pairs .",
    "we refer to these as _ foreground _ and denote the number of pairs as  and the like - sign pairs as .",
    "the foreground pairs contain signal pairs ( ) from the sources that we are interested in , and background pairs .",
    "electrons and positrons from different physical sources ( ) are uncorrelated",
    ". additionally , there are some background pairs which are correlated ( ) , described in section [ sec : corr_bkg ] . both types of background are subtracted statistically from the foreground to extract the signal .",
    "since the background is typically larger than the signal , the background estimation requires precision of a few percent .",
    "the signal - to - background ( @xmath45 ) ratio varies with invariant mass of the pairs . in collisions ,",
    "the @xmath29 integrated @xmath45 is larger than 1.0 only near the vector meson masses .",
    "it is below 0.1 for the low mass continuum ( @xmath461.0 gev/@xmath44 ) . in the intermediate mass continuum ( 1.0 - 3.0 gev/@xmath44 ) , the @xmath45 is roughly constant between 0.2 - 0.3 ; the @xmath45 increases for higher mass .",
    "mass distribution for the combinatorial background determined by event mixing  and as the red and black line , respectively .",
    "the shape difference due to the difference in acceptance between like - sign and unlike - sign pairs in phenix is clearly visible .",
    "also shown are foreground like - sign pairs ( black points ) and corrected for the acceptance difference ( red points ) .",
    "the differences between points and lines are the the correlated background . ]",
    "there are two different approaches to estimating the background , ( i ) the like - sign subtraction technique based on the measured like - sign foreground  or ( ii ) the event mixing technique . in the phenix experiment",
    "the acceptance for like and unlike - sign pairs is different due to the two arm geometry and thus the shape of the invariant mass distributions are different as illustrated in figure  [ fig : rel_accp ] .",
    "we therefore traditionally have used the event mixing technique . in this method ,",
    "combinatorial background is estimated by taking an electron from event _ i _ and pairing it with a positron from event _",
    "j_(@xmath47 ) .",
    "this is a powerful approach as it allows for an extremely high statistics estimation of the background @xcite .",
    "however , such an estimation must be normalized with a precision much better than the @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , the mixed event spectra do not contain any of the correlated background and therefore these additional pairs must be estimated using monte carlo methods .    in this paper",
    "we use the like - sign subtraction technique , which avoids the complications inherent in the mixed event background estimation .",
    "this method uses the acceptance difference for like and unlike - sign pairs , described in section [ sec : likesign ] .",
    "there are two sources of correlated background : _ cross pairs _ and _ jet pairs _",
    "cross pairs are correlated through a hadron decay that results in two @xmath0 pairs .",
    "these pairs originate from @xmath48 and @xmath49 double - dalitz decays ( @xmath50 ) , a single - dalitz decay accompanied by a photon conversion ( @xmath51 ) , and diphoton decays with both photons converting ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the cross pair correlation arises because of the small opening angle between the virtual and/or real decay photons .",
    "the resulting dielectrons tend to manifest at low mass and high @xmath8 .",
    "jet pairs are the other major source of correlated background . in this case , the electron and positron are decay products of different hadrons inside jets .",
    "di - jet production and fragmentation causes a correlation in the parent hadrons , which is inherited by the daughter electrons .",
    "when the electron and positron are from opposing ( back - to - back ) jets , the pair typically has low @xmath8 and high mass .",
    "when they arise from two hadrons in the same jet , the pair typically has a high @xmath8 and low mass .",
    "since cross pairs and jet pairs result from two pairs , correlated pairs with like and unlike - sign are produced at the same rate .",
    "this fact can be exploited to correct for correlated background in the unlike - sign distribution .",
    "the like - sign subtraction technique uses the foreground like - sign pairs  to determine the background .",
    "this has two distinct advantages over the event mixing technique .",
    "first , the measured yield  requires no additional absolute normalization .",
    "the second advantage , which was mentioned in the previous section , is that  contains the identical amount of correlated background as the measured @xmath0 pairs .",
    "hence , no independent simulation of the correlated background is needed .",
    "this method , however , can be used in phenix only after correcting for the different acceptance for like - sign and unlike - sign pairs of the two - arm configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rel_accp ] ) .",
    "this correction is provided by the ratio of the acceptance functions for unlike- and like - sign pairs , the relative acceptance correction , @xmath53 , which is due solely to the detector geometry and is determined using mixed events as follows :    @xmath54    the ratio of mixed - event unlike - sign to like - sign pairs is calculated differentially in mass and @xmath29 and is applied to each run group separately .    figure  [ fig : rel_accp ] shows the mass distribution for the unlike and like - sign pairs in mixed events , and , respectively .",
    "also shown is the mass spectrum for like - sign pairs .",
    "the relative acceptance correction translates to the unlike - sign pair space via @xmath55 .",
    "deviations between the @xmath53 corrected like - sign spectrum and the unlike - sign mixed events correspond to the cross pairs and jet pairs .",
    "the top panel shows the @xmath0 pair foreground @xmath56 , the combinatorial background  determined through event mixing , and the difference of the two which is the sum of the signal we are interested in  and the correlated background  that still needs to be subtracted .",
    "shown in the middle panel is the estimate of the correlated background , which is the difference between the foreground like - sign pairs  corrected for the relative acceptance difference @xmath53 between and ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rel_accp ] and eq .",
    "[ eq_alpha ] ) and the combinatorial background .",
    "the bottom panel shows the signal  which is calculated as @xmath57 . in this plot ,",
    "the combinatorial background is normalized in a region with minimal correlated background@xcite . ]",
    "the subtraction procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_bkg ] .",
    "it illustrates the steps to transform the measured @xmath0 pairs in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_bkg](a ) to the signal of interest  in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_bkg](c ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : signal_bkg](a ) shows , and their difference , which corresponds to the signal plus the correlated background .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_bkg](b ) shows  calculated as the difference , @xmath58 . the signal   is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_bkg](c ) .",
    "the actual background subtraction is done double - differentially , and separately for each run group , as well as separately for minimum bias and electron triggered events .",
    "@xmath59    for the electron triggered events , the trigger used in the data collection biases the single electron distribution towards high and as such the triggered events can not be mixed with each other .",
    "thus to generate the correct combinatorial background shape of pairs , the mixed events are generated from the minimum bias data sample , but as in the real events , they are required to satisfy the trigger requirement .",
    "every mixed pair therefore contains at least one electron that fulfills the trigger condition@xcite .",
    "approximately 1/3 of the @xmath61 pairs from production are like - sign pairs . using the like - sign subtraction technique ,",
    "these are removed from the signal .",
    "the main decay chains for @xmath60 and @xmath62 mesons to @xmath61 pairs are shown in table .",
    "[ tab : decays ] . while for , only the direct semi - leptonic decays , ( 1 ) in table .  [ tab : decays ] ,",
    "contribute , many more possibilities exist for .",
    "decay combinations ( 1),(1 ) and ( 2),(2 ) lead to @xmath0 pairs , while combinations ( 2)(1 ) and ( 1)(2 ) lead to @xmath63 and @xmath64 pairs due to the flavor change in the decay .",
    "the last decay chain ( 3 ) involves decay of a single @xmath65 or @xmath66 and produces only pairs . since the semi - leptonic decay channels for @xmath60 and @xmath62 mesons have approximately equal branching ratios , and more than 90% of @xmath60 mesons decay to @xmath62 , all three groups of decays are approximately equally likely .",
    "this results in about a third of all @xmath61 pairs from decays being like - sign pairs .",
    "[ tab : decays ]    .summary of the most relevant and decay chains that contribute to pairs .",
    "the effective branching ratio averages over all possible meson combinations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sigma_bb ]    cold - nuclear - matter effects have been measured for heavy flavor in @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the effects are small enough to be within the quoted uncertainties of the measurement presented here . in others , they occur at forward or backward rapidity where the effects will not be observed by these data at midrapidity .",
    "the determination of the charm cross section is less reliable due to the large model dependence . using the pythiacalculation we find @xmath67b and for the mc@nlocalculation we find @xmath68b .",
    "we conclude that the large model dependence does not allow an accurate determination of the charm cross section from our pair measurement .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : cc_ee_pairs ] , the model dependence of the pair acceptance is already substantial for detection of pairs with mass @xmath25 1.16 gev/@xmath44 in one unit of rapidity . to test predictions for cold - nuclear - matter effects with dilepton data will require comparisons within specific models .",
    "calculations should compare the shape of the predicted mass and @xmath8 spectra to those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublediffdata ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : hfprojections ] .",
    "phenix recorded a large sample of pairs from collisions at = 200 gev in 2008 .",
    "the pair yield is consistent with the expected yield from pseudoscalar and vector meson decays and semi - leptonic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "the high statistical precision of the data allows exploration of both the mass and dependence of the yield . using the double differential information",
    ", we can clearly isolate the contribution of heavy flavor decays and determine the fraction of the yield from and production .",
    "we report the first measurement of the production cross section in @xmath14au collisions .",
    "our procedure utilizes model predictions of the shape of the double differential spectra from and production , with a filter requiring that the @xmath69 and @xmath70 fall inside the phenix central arm acceptance .",
    "the two simulations used in this work , pythiaand mc@nlo , predict very different correlations between the @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in pythiathe correlation is driven by the particular implementation of intrinsic @xmath73 , while in mc@nlothe correlation arises from including nlo terms in the calculation .    for production ,",
    "the fraction of pairs at midrapidity , and therefore also in the phenix acceptance , is primarily determined by the decay kinematics of the two independent semi - leptonic decays and is not sensitive to the substantial model dependence on the correlations . for the same reason ,",
    "the fraction of pairs at midrapidity is not sensitive to possible modifications of the momenta for @xmath65 and @xmath66 due to cold - nuclear - matter effects .",
    "determination of the cross section thus has little model dependence and the measured double differential spectra can be used to reliably calculate the production cross section , for which we find : @xmath74 a search for cold - nuclear - matter effects will be possible by comparing the double differential results reported here with those in collisions .",
    "the current result should already help to constrain models of cold - nuclear - matter effects on heavy quark production .",
