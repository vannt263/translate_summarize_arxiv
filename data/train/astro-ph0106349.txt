    "recent observations @xcite of type ia supernovae at intermediate redshift , along with complementary observational constraints at low and intermediate redshift , as well as the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background all indicate @xcite that the universe may be presently accelerating due to the influence of a dominant dark energy with a negative pressure .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this dark energy is a cosmological constant for which the equation of state is @xmath0 . a second possibility is derived from the so - called  quintessence \" models . in this case the dark energy is the result of a scalar field @xmath1 slowly evolving along an effective potential @xmath2 .",
    "the equation of state is negative @xmath3 , but not necessarily constant .    introducing either of these paradigms",
    ", however , leads inevitably to two nagging questions .",
    "one is a fine tuning problem as to why the present dark energy is so small compared to the natural scales of high - energy physics .",
    "the second is a cosmic coincidence problem as to why the universe has conspired to produce nearly equivalent energy content in matter and dark energy at the present time .",
    "attempts have been made @xcite to reformulate this quandary by introducing specific forms of the quintessence effective potential whereby a tracker field @xmath1 evolves according to an attractor - like solution to the equations of motion .",
    "that is , for a wide variety of initial conditions , the solutions for @xmath1 and @xmath4 rapidly approach a common evolutionary track .",
    "the nice feature of these solutions is that they lead naturally to a cross over from an earlier radiation - dominated solution to one in which the universe is dominated by a small dark energy at late times .",
    "another interesting possible feature is that such models might also naturally arise during matter creation at the end of an earlier  quintessential  inflationary epoch @xcite . in this case",
    ", the @xmath1 field emerges in a kinetic - dominated regime at energy densities above the tracker solution .",
    "it is not yet clear , however , @xcite that these models have altogether solved the fine - tuning and cosmic - coincidence problems .",
    "nevertheless , several such tracker fields have been proposed @xcite .",
    "although there is some difficulty in aligning quintessence models and string theory @xcite , the form for the effective potentials may at least be suggested by particle physics models with dynamical symmetry breaking , by nonperturbative effects @xcite , by generic kinetic terms `` @xmath5-essence '' in an effective action describing the moduli and massless degrees of freedom in string and supergravity theories @xcite , or by static and moving branes in a dilaton gravity background @xcite .",
    "a general feature of all such solutions , however , is that at least the possibility exists for a significant contribution of the @xmath1 field to the total energy density during the radiation - dominated or photon decoupling epochs as well as the present matter - dominated epoch .",
    "the yields of primordial nucleosynthesis and the power spectrum of the cmb are strongly affected by the background energy density and universal expansion rate .",
    "therefore , the possibility exists to utilize primordial nucleosynthesis and the cmb power spectrum to constrain otherwise viable quintessence or @xmath5-essence models .",
    "observational constraints on such quintessence models have been of considerable recent interest .",
    "for example , in @xcite the constraints on an @xmath6-theory motivated exponential form with a quadratic prefactor @xcite for the quintessence effective potential were considered . in this model",
    ", the @xmath1 field closely follows the background field . in @xcite",
    "a study was made of the effect on primordial nucleosynthesis of extended quintessence with nonminimal coupling . in such models",
    "the quintessence field couples with the scalar curvature .",
    "it can then act to slow the expansion and affect the yields of primordial nucleosynthesis . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the power - law effective potential and its supergravity - corrected form as described below .",
    "we construct a detailed mapping of the allowed parameter space for these quintessence models .",
    "we also consider constraints these considerations place on the epoch of matter generation at the end of quintessential inflation .",
    "a variety of quintessence @xcite effective potentials or @xmath5-essence effective actions @xcite can be found in the literature . in this paper , however , we will not consider @xmath5-essence effective actions as we have found that the attractor - like solution is limited to a prohibitively small range of parameters of the effective lagrangian .",
    "we will , however , consider kinetic dominated quintessence models . here , we concentrate on what is a frequently invoked form for the effective potential of the tracker field , i.e. an inverse power law such as originally analyzed by ratra and peebles @xcite , @xmath7 where , @xmath6 and @xmath8 are parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 in these potentials is fixed by the condition that @xmath9 at present .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 and @xmath11 if @xmath1 is presently near the planck mass and @xmath8 is too small ( say @xmath12 ) , this implies a small value @xcite for @xmath6 which in a sense reintroduces the fine tuning problem .    we will also consider a modified form of @xmath2 as proposed by @xcite based upon the condition that the quintessence fields be part of supergravity models .",
    "the rewriting of the effective potential in supergravity depends upon choices of the khler potential @xcite .",
    "the flat khler potential yields an extra factor of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this comes about by imposing the condition that the expectation value of the superpotential vanishes .",
    "the ratra potential thus becomes @xmath14 where the exponential correction becomes largest near the present time as @xmath15 .",
    "this supergravity motivated effective potential is known as the sugra potential .",
    "the fact that this potential has a minimum for @xmath16 changes the dynamics .",
    "it causes the present value of @xmath17 to evolve to a cosmological constant ( @xmath18 ) much quicker than for the bare power - law potential @xcite .",
    "the quintessence field @xmath1 obeys the equation of motion @xmath19 where the hubble parameter @xmath20 is given from the solution to the friedmann equation , @xmath21 where @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 is the energy density in background radiation and matter , and @xmath24 is the cosmic scale factor .    for the simple inverse power - law potential , it can be shown @xcite that the tracker solution maintains the condition @xmath25h^2~~.\\ ] ] as the @xmath1 field evolves , its contribution to the energy density is given by @xmath26 which may or may not be comparable to the energy density in radiation during the nucleosynthesis or photon - decoupling epoch depending upon the parameters and initial conditions .    the quintessence initial conditions are probably set in place near the inflation epoch . by the time of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch , many of the possible initial conditions will have already achieved the tracker solution .",
    "however , for initial conditions sufficiently removed from the tracker solution , it is quite possible that the tracker solution has not yet been achieved by the time of bbn .",
    "such possibilities are illustrated schematically in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "these correspond to cases in which the initial energy density falls above ( curve @xmath27 ) , near ( curve @xmath28 ) or below ( curve @xmath29 ) the tracker solution .",
    "there are several paradigms of possible interest for constraint by primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "these depend upon the initial values for the energy density in the @xmath1 field . in any of these cases ,",
    "the energy density in @xmath30 can be constrained by the ratio @xmath31 during the bbn epoch at @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "if the initial conditions are sufficiently close to the tracker solution @xmath34 before nucleosynthesis , then @xmath35 during nucleosynthesis and the tracker solution specifies the energy density in the @xmath1 field .",
    "this situation is similar to curve @xmath28 in figure 1",
    ". this may be the most likely scenario . along the tracker solution , @xmath30 diminishes in a slightly different way than the radiation - dominant background energy density .",
    "for example , as long as @xmath36 , the @xmath1-field decays as @xmath37 with @xmath38 the equation of state @xmath17 is only equal to the background equation of state @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "this is equivalent to the exponential potential .",
    "nevertheless , the tracker solution does not deviate much from @xmath23 , even at high redshift for most values of @xmath8 considered here .",
    "hence , one can characterize the nucleosynthesis results by the ( nearly constant ) ratio @xmath31 during the bbn epoch .",
    "if the energy density in the tracker solution is close to the background energy density , the nucleosynthesis will be affected by the increased expansion rate from the increased total energy density .",
    "such a situation occurs for large values of the power - law exponent @xmath8 .",
    "a second possibility is that the energy density @xmath30 could exceed the tracker solution and be comparable to or greater than the background energy density during primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "this situation is something like curve @xmath27 in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the kinetic energy in the @xmath1 field dominates over the potential energy contribution to @xmath30 and @xmath41 so that the kinetic energy density diminishes as @xmath42 . in this case",
    "there could be a significant contribution from @xmath30 during nucleosynthesis as the @xmath1 field approaches the tracker solution .",
    "the strongest constraints on this case would arise when @xmath30 is comparable to the background energy density near the time of the weak - reaction freese out , while the later nuclear - reaction epoch might be unaffected .",
    "this case @xmath27 is particularly interesting as this kinetic - dominated evolution could be generated by an earlier quintessential inflation epoch @xcite as described below .",
    "a final possibility might occur if the @xmath1 field approaches the tracker solution from below as indicated by curve @xmath29 in figure [ fig:1 ] . in this case",
    ", the tracker solution may be achieved after the the bbn epoch so that a small @xmath30 during bbn is easily guaranteed . in such models , however , the ultimate tracker curve might have a large energy density at a later epoch which could be constrained by the later cmb epoch as described below .",
    "the primordial light - element abundances deduced from observations have been reviewed by a number of recent papers @xcite .",
    "there are several outstanding uncertainties . for primordial helium",
    "there is an uncertainty due to the fact that the deduced abundances tend to reside in one of two possible values .",
    "hence , for 4 we adopt a rather conservative range : @xmath43 for deuterium there is a similar possibility for either a high or low value . here , however , we adopt the generally accepted @xcite low values of @xmath44    the primordial lithium abundance can be inferred from the surface abundances of old halo stars .",
    "there is , however , some uncertainty from the possibility that old halo stars may have gradually depleted their primordial lithium . because of this we do not consider primordial lithium in the discussions here .",
    "the adoption of the low deuterium abundance forces the bbn primordial helium to be near its upper limit .",
    "adding energy density from the @xmath1 field tends to increase the universal expansion rate .",
    "consequently , the weak reaction rates freeze out at a higher temperature @xmath45 .",
    "this fixes the neutron to proton ratio ( @xmath46}$ ] ) at a larger value .",
    "since most of the free neutrons are converted into @xmath47 , the primordial helium production is increased .",
    "also , since the epoch of nuclear reactions is shortened , the efficiency of burning deuterium into helium is diminished and the deuterium abundance also increases .",
    "hence , very little excess energy density from the @xmath1 field is allowed .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] summarizes allowed values of @xmath31 at @xmath481 mev ( @xmath49 ) based upon the nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "the region to the right of the curve labeled @xmath50 corresponds to models in which the primordial deuterium constraint is satisfied , @xmath51 .",
    "the region below the line labeled @xmath52 corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "the hatched region summarizes allowed values for the energy density in the quintessence field during the nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "this figure is similar to that obtained in freese et al .",
    "@xcite based upon the light - element constraints available at that time .",
    "they similarly considered dark energy densities which scale proportionally to the background radiation energy density . however , in their study a somewhat larger range of possible dark energies was allowed due to the larger uncertainties in the observed primordial abundances and the neutron half life at that time .    in the present work we deduce an absolute upper limit of 5.6% of the background radiation energy density allowed in the quintessence field .",
    "this maximum contribution is only allowed for @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "a smaller contribution is allowed for other values of @xmath56 . indeed , this optimum @xmath56 value is @xmath57 less than the value implied by the cosmic deuterium abundance @xcite @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the most recent independent determinations of @xmath60 from high - resolution measurements of the power spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background favor a value even higher . both the boomerang @xcite and dasi @xcite data sets imply @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the deuterium and cmb constraints together demand that @xmath63 which would limit the allowed contribution from the @xmath1 field to @xmath64 of the background energy density .",
    "the most restrictive cmb constraint on @xmath60 derives from demanding a flat universe ( @xmath65 ) , and marginalizing the likelihood function over all parameters with assumed gaussian priors @xcite based upon measurements of large - scale structure and type ia supernovae .",
    "this gives @xmath66 . if one adopts this as a most extreme case , then @xmath67",
    "this would correspond to @xmath68 . from figure 2",
    "this would imply a much more stringent constraint that only about 0.1% of the background energy density could be contributed by the @xmath1 field .",
    "of course , this is only a @xmath69 constraint , and it is questionable as to whether the upper limit to @xmath52 is well enough established to rule out a contribution to the energy density at the 0.1% level . for the remainder of this paper",
    "we will adopt the more conservative constraint of 5.6% . nevertheless , it is of interest to explore how the quintessence parameters allowed by bbn might improve should the constraints from bbn ever be so tightly defined .",
    "therefore , we will consider 0.1% as a conceivable limit that demonstrates the sensitivity to bbn .",
    "even the most conservative 5.6% limit adopted here corresponds to only about half of the energy density allowed in @xcite for 3 neutrino flavors .",
    "another constraint on allowed parameters for the quintessence field derives from the simple requirement that the @xmath1 field behaves like dark energy during the present matter - dominated epoch .",
    "stated another way , the equation of state should be sufficiently negative , i.e. @xmath70 by the present time .    in general",
    ", @xmath17 is a time - dependent quantity .",
    "the energy density and pressure in the @xmath1 field can be written @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this gives , @xmath73 where the time dependence derives from the evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath74 .",
    "a comprehensive study of the observational constraints on the present value of @xmath17 has been recently summarized by wang et al .",
    "we adopt the same constraints deduced in that paper .",
    "mindful of systematic errors , they adopted a most conservative approach based upon progressively less reliable data sets . using the most reliable current low - redshift and microwave background measurements",
    ", they deduce limits of @xmath75 at the 2@xmath76 level .",
    "factoring in the constraint from type ia supernovae reduces the range for the equation of state to @xmath77 .",
    "this range derives from a concordance analysis of models consistent with each observational constraint at the @xmath78 level or better .",
    "a combined maximum likelihood analysis suggests a smaller range of @xmath79 for quintessence models which follow the tracker solution , though @xmath80 is still allowed in models with nearly a constant dark energy . in what follows",
    ", we also invoke these same three possible limit ranges for the present value of @xmath17 .",
    "as we shall see , these limits place a strong constraint on the bare ratra power - law potential for almost any value of @xmath8 .",
    "however , the sugra corrected form of @xmath2 is only slightly constrained .",
    "a third constraint on the quintessence field arises from its effect on the epoch of photon decoupling .",
    "there are two effects to be considered .",
    "one is the effect of the @xmath1 field on the observed microwave background in the case where the energy density in the quintessence field is negligible during photon decoupling .",
    "this has been considered in @xcite . in this case",
    "the effect of the dark energy is to modify the angular distance - redshift relation @xcite .",
    "the existence of dark energy during the look - back time to the surface of last scattering shifts the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum to smaller angular scales and larger @xmath81-values .",
    "the amplitude of the first acoustic peak in the power spectrum also increases , but not as much for quintessence models as for a true cosmological constant @xmath82 .",
    "the basic features of the observed power spectrum @xcite can be fit @xcite with either of the quintessence potentials considered here .",
    "indeed , dark energy is required to reproduce both the observed power spectrum and the type ia supernova data . for our purposes ,",
    "this look - back constraint is already satisfied by demanding that @xmath9 at the present time through eqs .",
    "( [ rhoq0 ] ) and ( [ mfix ] ) .",
    "there is , however , an additional possible effect of the @xmath1 field on the cmb which we also use as a constraint . if the energy density in the @xmath1 field is a significant fraction of the background energy during the epoch of photon decoupling , it can increase the expansion rate . increasing the expansion rate",
    "can also push the @xmath81 values for the acoustic peaks in the spectrum to larger values and increase their amplitude @xcite .",
    "such an effect of an increased expansion rate has been considered by a number of authors in various contexts @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "we adopt the constraint deduced by @xcite based upon the latest cmb sky maps of the boomerang @xcite and dasi @xcite collaborations that the density in the @xmath1 field can not exceed @xmath83 during the epoch of photon decoupling .",
    "this implies a maximum allowed contribution of the @xmath1 field during photon decoupling of @xmath84 .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath1 field behaves differently near photon decoupling than during the bbn epoch ( cf .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . after the transition from a radiation - dominated to a matter - dominated universe , the @xmath1 field ( now coupled to the matter field ) can contribute a much larger fraction of the background energy density ( e.g. curve @xmath28 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) than in the bbn epoch .",
    "hence , the constraint on @xmath30 field from bbn must be considered separately from the constraint at the cmb epoch .",
    "another possible constraint arises if the kinetic term dominates at an early stage ( e.g. curve @xmath27 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in this case @xmath85 and @xmath30 decreases with scale factor as @xmath42 . at very early times",
    "this kinetic regime can be produced by so - called `` quintessential inflation '' @xcite . in this paradigm entropy in the matter fields",
    "comes from gravitational particle production at the end of inflation .",
    "the universe is presumed to exit from inflation directly into a kinetic - dominated quintessence regime during which the matter is generated . an unavoidable consequence of this process , however , is the generation of gravitational waves along with matter and the quanta of the quintessence field @xcite at the end of inflation .",
    "particle creation at the end of inflation has been studied by the standard methods of quantum field theory in curved space - time @xcite .",
    "the energy density in created particles is just @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the expansion factor and redshift at the matter thermalization epoch at the end of quintessential inflation , respectively .",
    "the factor of 128 in this expression comes from the explicit integration of the particle creation terms .",
    "when the gravitons and quanta of the @xmath1 field are formed at the end of inflation , one expects @xcite the energy density in gravity waves to be twice the energy density in the @xmath1-field quanta ( because there are two graviton polarization states ) . in this paradigm then , wherever we have deduced a constraint on @xmath30 , it should be taken as the sum of three different contributions .",
    "one is the dark energy from the vacuum expectation value @xmath89 of the @xmath1 field ; a second is the contribution from the fluctuating part @xmath90 of the @xmath1 field ; and a third is from the energy density @xmath91 in relic gravity waves .",
    "thus , we have @xmath92 for the cases of interest , the energy density in gravity waves and quanta scales like radiation after inflation , @xmath93 , while the quintessence field vacuum expectation value evolves according to eq .",
    "( [ qdecay ] ) which gives @xmath94 during the kinetic dominated epoch .",
    "this epoch following inflation lasts until the energy in the @xmath1 field falls below the energy in background radiation and matter , @xmath95 .",
    "thus , for the kinetic dominated initial conditions ( curve a ) in particular , gravity waves could be an important contributor to the excess energy density during nucleosynthesis .",
    "the relative contribution of gravity waves and quintessence quanta compared to the background matter fields is just given by the relative number of degrees of freedom .",
    "at the end of inflation , the relative fraction of energy density in quanta and gravity waves is given by @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of ordinary scalar fields at the end of inflation .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric model @xmath98 . propagating this ratio to the time of nucleosynthesis requires another factor of @xmath99 where @xmath100 counts the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom just before electron - positron annihilation , and @xmath101 counts the number of degrees of freedom during matter thermalization after the end of inflation . in the minimal standard model @xmath102 , but in supergravity models this increases @xmath103 .    combining these factors we have @xmath104 during nucleosynthesis .",
    "hence , in this paradigm , the allowed values of @xmath31 consistent with nucleosynthesis could be reduced from a maximum of 0.056 to 0.042 , further tightening the constraints deduced here",
    ".      there has been considerable recent interest @xcite in the spectrum of gravity waves produced in the quintessential inflation paradigm .",
    "one might expect that the _ cobe _ constraints on the spectrum also lead to constraints on the @xmath1 field .",
    "here we consider this possibility , but conclude that no significant constraint on the initial @xmath30 or effective potential is derived from the gravity wave spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the bbn and cmb gravity - wave constraints discussed here can be used to provide useful constraints on the quintessential inflation epoch as we now describe .",
    "our argument is as follows : the logarithmic gravity - wave energy spectrum observed at the present time can be defined in terms of a differential closure fraction , @xmath105 where the @xmath91 is the present energy density in relic gravitons and @xmath106 is the critical density .",
    "this spectrum has been derived in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by spikes at low and high frequency .",
    "the most stringent constraint at present derives from the _ cobe _ limit on the tensor component of the cmb power spectrum at low multipoles .",
    "there is also a weak constraint from the binary pulsar @xcite and an integral constraint from nucleosynthesis as mentioned above .    for our purposes ,",
    "the only possible new constraint comes from the _ cobe _ limits on the tensor component of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the soft branch in the gravity - wave spectrum lies in the frequency range between the present horizon @xmath107 hz and the decoupling frequency @xmath108 hz , where we adopt @xmath109 for the present matter closure fraction .",
    "the constraint on the spectrum can be written @xcite , @xmath110 where , @xmath111 is the present closure fraction in photons .",
    "the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at decoupling is @xmath112 . as noted previously",

    "( [ h1lim ] ) that @xmath131 .",
    "these equations then imply that there is only a lower limit on @xmath31 given by the constraint on @xmath87 . combining eqs .",

    "this limit is not particularly useful because @xmath30 field must exceed @xmath23 at @xmath88 in order for the gravitational particle production paradigm to work .",
    "the implication is then that all initial conditions in which the kinetic term dominates over the background energy at @xmath88 are allowed in the quintessential inflation scenario .",
    "hence , we conclude that the gravity - wave spectrum does not presently constrain the initial @xmath30 or @xmath2 in the quintessential inflation model .    before leaving this discussion on quintessential inflation",
    ", however , we remark that the limits on @xmath135 derived from the bbn constraints discussed below , can be used to place a lower limit on the expansion rate at the end of inflation in this model .",
    "this in turn can be used to deduce a lower limit on the redshift for the end of quintessential inflation from eq .",
    "( [ rhonow ] ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath136 and in the minimal supersymmetric model @xmath137 this nontrivial constraint then implies that the kinetic driven quintessential inflation must end at an energy scale somewhere between about 10@xmath138 and 10@xmath139 gev , well below the planck scale . by similar reasoning",
    "one can apply this argument to the gravity - wave spectrum from normal inflation as given in @xcite .",

    "( [ qddot ] ) and ( [ friedmann ] ) ] were evolved for a variety of initial @xmath1 field strengths and power - law parameters @xmath8 .",
    "as initial conditions , the quintessence field was assumed to begin with equipartition , i.e.  @xmath142 .",
    "this implies @xmath143 initially .",

    "we do not consider this as a likely case , however .",
    "the natural initial values for the quintessence field are @xmath146 , so that sufficient dark energy should always be present for this potential choice .",

    "if the initial energy density in the @xmath1 field is too large , the tracker solution is not reached by the time of bbn .",
    "the @xmath1-field energy density can then significantly exceed the background energy during nucleosynthesis .",
    "this situation corresponds to the excluded regions on the top of figures [ fig:3]a and [ fig:3]b .",
    "all solutions consistent with the primordial nucleosynthesis constraints are also consistent with our adopted cmb @xmath1-energy constraint as also shown at the top of figures [ fig:3]a and [ fig:3]b .",
    "similarly , if the initial energy in the @xmath1 field is too small , the universe does not become dark - energy dominated by the present time .",
    "this corresponds to the excluded ( no @xmath82 ) region at the bottom of the figures .",
    "the excluded regions at the top and bottom of figures [ fig:3]a and [ fig:3]b can be easily understood analytically .",
    "for example , the excluded ( no @xmath82 ) region at the bottom of these figures reflects the fact that if @xmath30 is initially below the value presently required by @xmath156 [ cf .",
    "( [ rhoq0 ] ) ] it can not evolve toward a larger value .",
    "hence , @xmath157 is ruled out for @xmath158 .",
    "similarly , the  excluded by bbn `` region comes from requiring that @xmath159 . for this constraint",
    "we are only considering cases in which the @xmath1 field is approaching the tracker solution from above during nucleosynthesis .",
    "hence , it is in the kinetic regime in which @xmath160 while the background scales as @xmath161 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath162 is excluded . by similar reasoning ,",
    "the ' ' excluded by cmb  region is given by @xmath163 , or @xmath164 .",
    "for the bare ratra power - law potential ( fig .",
    "3a ) the main constraint is simply the requirement that the equation of state be sufficiently negative by the present time .",
    "the sensitivity of the allowed power - law exponent to the equation of state is indicated by the @xmath165 -0.2 , -0.4 , and -0.6 lines on figure [ fig:3]a . in the present @xmath1-dominated epoch ,",
    "( [ wq ] ) is no longer valid even in the tracker regime .",
    "thus , the lines of constant @xmath17 must be evaluated numerically using eq .",
    "( [ wqnum ] ) . the slight slope to these curves comes from the fact that @xmath166 has not yet reached unity , i.e.  there is still some small kinetic contribution to @xmath74 and the amount of kinetic contribution depends upon @xmath8 .    for the bare ratra power - law potential ,",
    "tracker solutions with @xmath167 are allowed if @xmath168 .",
    "the allowed values for @xmath8 reduce to @xmath169 and @xmath170 if the more stringent -0.4 and -0.6 constraints are adopted .",
    "if @xmath8 is too small , say @xmath171 , then the potential parameter @xmath6 becomes a very small fraction of the planck mass [ cf .",
    "( [ mfix ] ) ] , and the fine tuning problem is reintroduced .    for models in which the tracker solution is obtained by the time of bbn",
    ", nucleosynthesis only limits the potential parameters if the most conservative equation of state limit ( @xmath172 ) and most stringent nucleosynthesis constraint ( @xmath173 ) are adapted . on the other hand , independently of the equation of state constraint",
    ", nucleosynthesis limits a large family of possible kinetic - dominated solutions in which the @xmath1-field energy density exceeds the background energy prior to and during the nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "such models are excluded even though they provide sufficient dark energy in the present epoch .    for the sugra - corrected @xmath1 fields ( fig .",
    "3b ) , the constraint from @xmath17 is greatly relaxed .",
    "in fact , @xmath17 is sufficiently negative ( @xmath174 ) for all @xmath175 .",
    "the reason is that all tracker solutions have @xmath18 .",
    "this is because @xmath17 decays much faster toward -1 for the sugra potential . also , the potential has a finite minimum which is equal to the present dark - energy density .",
    "the q field quickly evolves to near the potential minimum and has negligible kinetic energy by the present time . any potential which becomes flat at late times gives @xmath18 and",
    "the dark energy looks like a cosmological constant @xmath82 .",
    "all sugra models which achieve the tracker solution also have a small @xmath30 during primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "hence , there is no constraint from nucleosynthesis except for those kinetic - dominated models in which the @xmath1 field is still far above the tracker solution during the nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "we do note , however , that if a lower limit of @xmath176 is adopted for tracker solutions from @xcite , then only a power law with @xmath177 is allowed as indicated on figure 3b .",
    "this makes the sugra potential the preferred candidate for quintessence .",
    "the large @xmath8 implies values of @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ mfix ] ) close to the planck mass , thus avoiding any fine tuning problem .",
    "however , this quintessence potential is constrainable by bbn should the light - element constraints become sufficiently precise to limit @xmath30 at the 0.1% level .",
    "we conclude that for both the bare rata inverse power - law potential and its sugra - corrected form , the main constraints for models which achieve the tracker solution by the nucleosynthesis epoch is from the requirement that the equation of state parameter becomes sufficiently negative by the present epoch .",
    "the main constraint from nucleosynthesis is for models in which the @xmath1 field has not yet obtained the tracker solution by the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the sugra - corrected potential is the least constrained and avoids the fine tuning problem for @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it may be the preferred candidate for the quintessence field , although bbn may eventually limit this possibility .",
    "we also note that the constraints considered here provide useful constraints on the regime of matter creation at the end of quintessential inflation .",
