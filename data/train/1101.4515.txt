    "multipartite entanglement plays a central role in quantum information science .",
    "entangled states have been generated and studied in various systems , including photons and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "of multipartite entangled states , a set of states known as dicke states @xcite has recently been attracting interest .",
    "dicke states are entangled states that are symmetric with respect to particle permutations .",
    "they are defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the number of particles and excitations and @xmath5 indicates the sum over all particle permutations .",
    "w states , a subset of dicke states with a single excitation , have been produced and investigated using up to eight trapped ions @xcite .",
    "dicke states of up to six photons have been generated and their unique characteristics , such as entanglement persistency against photon loss and projective measurements , have been studied @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a relatively simple and effective method for generating dicke states in a string of ions that utilizes frequency - chirped optical pulses .",
    "the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to generate dicke states for arbitrary numbers of particles and excitations . for small numbers of excitations @xmath4 ,",
    "resonant pulses can also be used to produce dicke states @xmath6 , although in this case perfect fidelity is possible only when @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the fidelity attainable by a method using resonant pulses and experimentally demonstrated it using two @xmath8mg@xmath1 ions and an ancillary @xmath9al@xmath1 ion .",
    "in this article we report the generation of an entangled state of two ions , @xmath10 , by using rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) @xcite in a sideband transition of @xmath11@xmath12 of @xmath0ca@xmath13 .",
    "we also analyze the effects of using optical pulses with time - dependent envelopes for rap .",
    "such pulses produce time - dependent ac stark shifts that may result in violation of adiabaticity .",
    "one advantage of using adiabatic passage to generate dicke states is its robustness against parameter variations . using an ac - stark - shift compensator that cancels time - dependent ac stark shifts , the robustness of entanglement generation",
    "is verified by varying the width and peak intensity of the optical pulse used for rap .",
    "the method employed here can be extended to generate larger dicke states with more particles and excitations .",
    "[ fig : idea ] depicts the basic concept for generating dicke states using rap .",
    "the internal states of two ions and the motional fock states of their axial center - of - mass ( com ) mode are respectively denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents a qubit state of each ion and @xmath17 denotes the motional quantum number .",
    "the ions are initially prepared in a motional fock state @xmath18 using either @xmath19 pulses or rap pulses on the blue ( red ) sideband and a carrier transition that are addressed to only one of the ions ; e.g. , a blue sideband @xmath19 pulse followed by a carrier @xmath19 pulse , both of which are addressed to the first ion , to transfer the ions as @xmath20 .",
    "an entangling operation is performed with a laser beam tuned closely to @xmath21 , which excites the red sideband transition , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the laser ( atomic resonance ) frequency and @xmath24 is the secular frequency of the axial com mode .",
    "this preserves the total number of excitations @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of atoms in @xmath27 ; hence , @xmath18 is coupled only to @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the relevant states form a v - shape diagram",
    ".    when the ions are excited by a single laser , the time dependences of the rabi frequency for each ion are the same up to a proportionality factor .",
    "in addition , the detuning for each ion will also be the same when the difference in level shifts due to zeeman or stark effects can be neglected .",
    "in such a case , the system can be further simplified by a unitary transformation in the upper manifold with @xmath30 spanned by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and it becomes equivalent to a two - state system and an uncoupled ( dark ) state ( right diagram in fig .",
    "this is one of the simplest examples of a more general prescription known as the morris  shore transformation @xcite .",
    "if the two ions have the rabi frequencies of the same time dependence , the two - state system will consist of @xmath18 and a dicke state ( or a bell state ) @xmath31 , with the uncoupled state being equal to another bell state with the same @xmath26 , @xmath32 .",
    "thus , starting from @xmath18 , either a @xmath19 pulse or rap on the red sideband transition can be used to transfer the population to the desired final state @xmath33 .",
    "1(b ) shows the adiabatic potentials for the case of rap and plots the energy levels with different detunings for the red sideband pulse .",
    "the population follows the lower curve to be adiabatically transferred from @xmath18 to @xmath34 .",
    "( here , the rabi frequencies are assumed to be constant for simplicity , while it is usually varied in actual experiments . )",
    "this scheme can be extended to more ions @xmath35 and more excitations @xmath36 to produce @xmath37 .",
    "the latter extension requires extending the morris  shore transformation to multilevel ladders @xcite ; in this case , the initial state @xmath38 is coupled to the final state by a ladder with @xmath39 energy levels . with unitary operations induced by resonant optical pulses ,",
    "the dynamics in this multilevel diagram never produce a unit population in the final state @xmath37 @xcite , whereas when using rap , such an objective can be accomplished , at least under ideal conditions @xcite .",
    "the trapping system and laser setup used in the present study are similar to those described in @xcite . in brief , we use two @xmath40 in a linear trap with center - of - mass frequencies of @xmath41 mhz . as the qubit states @xmath42 and @xmath43 are used , and the transition between them is excited by a titanium  sapphire laser beam with a wavelength of 729 nm .",
    "the envelopes and frequencies of the optical pulses used for rap are controlled by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) in a double - pass configuration .",
    "linear frequency chirping of the rf for the aom is performed using a direct digital synthesizer .",
    "the pulse envelope is varied by using a mixer with a digital - to - analog converter as an input .",
    "both the direct digital synthesizer and the digital - to - analog converter are controlled by a field - programmable gate array .",
    "individual addressing is required to prepare motional fock states in advance to the entangling operation , which is here done using ac stark shifts generated by a 854 nm beam that is off resonance with the @xmath44@xmath45 transition .",
    "this beam , which has a @xmath46 intensity radius of 15 @xmath47 m , is applied to the two ions at 45 degrees to their axis , with a small offset from their center to produce different shifts for the ions .",
    "typical shifts for the two ions are @xmath48(10 , 100 ) khz , respectively .",
    "after doppler cooling and ground - state cooling of axial com and stretch modes , average quantum numbers @xmath49 are obtained , respectively .",
    "a motional fock state @xmath50 is prepared by applying a blue sideband and a carrier @xmath19 pulse in series to one ion using the individual addressing technique described above .",
    "an entangling operation is then performed by applying a chirped pulse to the red sideband transitions of both ions . a chirp width of 200 khz typically used ; i.e.",
    ", the detuning is swept from @xmath51100 to + 100 khz .",
    "we also use an ac - stark - shift compensator in experiments to verify the robustness of dicke state generation ( see  [ sec : robustness ] ) . to realize this",
    ", we use another aom in a single - pass configuration .",
    "two rf signals with independently variable frequencies and powers , one of which is for direct excitation and the other for ac - stark - shift compensation , are combined and fed to this aom .",
    "the output of this aom is directed into a single - mode optical fiber and then into the above - mentioned double - pass aom system , and it is applied to ions .",
    "the fidelity for generating a dicke state @xmath52 , @xmath53 , is analyzed by performing global rotations and projective measurements .",
    "the sum of the diagonal elements , @xmath54 is estimated by performing projective measurements immediately after the rap pulse . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : dicke](a ) .",
    "the histogram of fluorescence counts obtained by using a 397-nm laser beam is plotted . from this , @xmath55 is obtained .    the term containing off - diagonal elements , @xmath56 is estimated by parity measurements after applying a @xmath57 pulse with a variable phase .",
    "the parity after applying a @xmath57 pulse with phase @xmath58 is expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 is the parity operator .",
    "@xmath61 represents the rotation operation with a @xmath57 pulse with phase @xmath58 . in cases with perfect fidelity , @xmath62 is unity regardless of @xmath58 . in realistic cases",
    ", the offsets of sinusoidal fits to the measured values give the values of @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig : dicke](b ) shows parity measurement results .",
    "open circles represent measured values of @xmath62 and the solid curve is a sinusoidal fit with period @xmath19 to the measured values . from this , @xmath64 is obtained .",
    "combined with the above result for the diagonal matrix elements , the fidelity for dicke state generation is estimated to be @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath52 can be transferred to @xmath66 with a @xmath57 pulse , and parity measurement after such a transfer may also give an indication of entanglement .",
    "the filled circles in fig.[fig : dicke](b ) represent parity after dicke state generation followed by two @xmath57 pulses with the phase of the second varied . the sinusoidal oscillation with period",
    "@xmath19 indicates the presence of @xmath66 after the first @xmath57 pulse . by combining this result with that for one @xmath57 pulse described above",
    ", we estimate the fidelity for generation of @xmath66 to be @xmath67 .",
    "the method used here for generating dicke states using rap on sideband transitions requires pulses with time - dependent envelopes to perform efficient population transfer .",
    "as is well known , when intense optical pulses are applied to sideband transitions they produce large ac stark shifts and can cause undesirable effects such as qubit - phase rotations @xcite . in the sideband rap case treated here , relevant adiabatic potentials may be deformed in unexpected ways and adiabaticity may be violated .",
    "this was avoided in the result presented above by selecting sets of parameter values such that the dynamics is not greatly affected by diabatic transitions . however ,",
    "if we consider robustness against variation of parameters such as the pulse width and the peak rabi frequency , which is one of the biggest advantages of the adiabatic method described here , we should manage ac stark shifts appropriately .",
    "we calculated adiabatic potentials and considered adiabaticity in the case of dicke - state generation using sideband rap .",
    "the calculation is based on the following time - dependent hamiltonian in a rotating frame . @xmath68\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) are state vectors for the @xmath71th ion , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is the time - dependent rabi frequency for carrier transitions , and @xmath75 is the detuning from their resonance . @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the lamb  dicke parameter and the annihilation operator for the axial com mode .",
    "we chose the following five basis states for the calculation , @xmath78 , @xmath18 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 represents @xmath83 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : acstark](a ) ] .",
    "these consist of the two states @xmath18 and @xmath79 , which are connected to each other by red sideband rap , and states that are directly connected to these two states by carrier excitation .",
    "the laser is assumed to illuminate both ions equally . in that case , the antisymmetric bell state @xmath84 becomes uncoupled with other internal states and can be excluded from consideration @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath85 can be neglected since it is only indirectly coupled with @xmath18 via @xmath80 through off - resonant carrier couplings . in fact , even @xmath78 and @xmath81 can be neglected when calculating energy shifts , since the ac stark shifts of @xmath79 due to the couplings with those states exactly cancel each other and have negligible effects . here , we consider these states for the sake of completeness .",
    "therefore , the only non - negligible shift originates from the coupling between @xmath18 and @xmath80 .",
    "[ fig : acstark](b ) shows the time dependence of the rabi frequency ( solid curve ) and detuning ( dashed curve ) of the assumed optical pulse .",
    "the rabi frequencies represent those for the carrier transition .",
    "[ fig : acstark](c ) shows the adiabatic potentials for relevant dressed states ( solid curves ) , obtained by diagonalizing a hamiltonian derived from the one given above .",
    "the two potentials roughly correspond to the bare states @xmath18 and @xmath79 , where @xmath86 .",
    "( the quantum number of the optical field is omitted for simplicity . )",
    "the bare - state potentials for @xmath18 and @xmath79 intersect at the center ( about 0.3 ms ) , where the adiabatic potentials for the dressed states approach each other , as expected .",
    "however , they also approach each other at @xmath480.11 ms , which is not expected in the case of rap in two - level systems . under some conditions",
    ", diabatic transitions could occur at such points , reducing the fidelity .    the probability for diabatic transitions from state @xmath87 to @xmath88 is estimated to be @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91/\\hbar$ ] , with @xmath92 being the adiabatic potential for @xmath87 . in short , the probability is determined by the maximum value of @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig : acstark](d ) shows the calculated values of @xmath93 . at points near 0.11 ms ,",
    "where the adiabatic potentials approach each other , this value has a local maximum , which indicates that adiabaticity is about to be violated . at slightly higher intensities ,",
    "the probability of diabatic transitions may become fatally large .    for comparison , potentials for an ideal case when",
    "the carrier couplings are omitted are also calculated .",
    "the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : acstark](c ) are calculated potentials for when the matrix elements for all the carrier couplings ( @xmath78@xmath79 , @xmath81@xmath79 , @xmath18@xmath80 ) are set to be zero .",
    "these potentials correspond to the case in which the energy shifts due to the carrier couplings are perfectly compensated by the use of an ac - stark - shift compensator ( see the next section ) .",
    "they have clean shapes and there is only one point where they approach each other . correspondingly , as shown by the dashed curve in fig.[fig : acstark](d ) , @xmath93 peaks only at the center , where the adiabaticity is easily satisfied since the rabi frequency is a maximum at that point .",
    "adiabaticity can be maintained by performing ac - stark - shift compensation @xcite .",
    "this can be done by applying another optical pulse such that the ac stark shift that it produces nearly cancels the original shift . using the ac - stark - shift compensator described in ",
    "[ sec : exp ] , we experimentally verified the robustness of dicke state generation against parameter variations .",
    "the compensator is used during both the blue sideband pulse in the fock state preparation process and the red sideband rap pulse .",
    "it is detuned in the opposite direction to the main beam for direct excitation in each period , and the absolute value of its detuning is set around a value determined by the power ratio of the two beams such that the two shifts nearly cancel each other . here ,",
    "the optical power of the compensator is set to @xmath4860% of the main beam ; accordingly , the absolute value of the detuning is centered on @xmath94 khz .    the fidelity measurement results for when",
    "the peak rabi frequency and the pulse width are varied are indicated by the circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : robustness](a ) and ( b ) , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the fidelity exceeds 0.5 over wide variations in the parameters ( 0.5 represents the inseparability criterion for two - particle entangled states @xcite ) .",
    "there are several possible causes for the fidelity of dicke state generation being limited to below 0.66 .",
    "the error consists mainly of that produced when preparing motional fock states and in the entangling operation with rap .",
    "the causes for the former include insufficient cooling to the motional ground state and an addressing error , and the causes of the latter include phase relaxation processes due to fluctuations in the laser frequency and magnetic field and fluctuations in residual ac stark shifts due to beam jitter .    to analyze such infidelity factors , the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which respectively reflect the diagonal and off - diagonal density matrix elements , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : robustness ] ( as crosses and asterisks , respectively ) .",
    "relatively high values are obtained for the former , whereas the latter is limited to below 0.5 over both parameter ranges and it decays with increasing pulse width .",
    "based on these facts , we speculate that the error generated in preparing motional fock states is not significant , since otherwise we would observe a large reduction in the diagonal matrix elements .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the infidelity factors are mainly associated with the entangling operation using rap .",
    "we speculate that phase relaxation processes during the entangling operation mainly cause the infidelity , which is consistent with the decay with increasing pulse width .",
    "we expect that the fidelity can be improved by using resonant pulses with improved 729-nm laser linewidths ( currently @xmath97400 hz ) and using transitions that are less sensitive to the magnetic field , such as @xmath98@xmath99 .",
    "we have demonstrated generation of entangled states using an adiabatic method and demonstrated the robustness of the generation process against parameter variations .",
    "the method described here can be extended to larger numbers of particles and excitations .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown experimentally that entangled states of inequivalent classes are obtained from six - photon dicke states @xmath100 via projection measurements on a few of their qubits . in a similar way",
