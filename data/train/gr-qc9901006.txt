    "observational confirmation of the existence of black holes is one of the most important challenges in astrophysics . recently",
    "a number of compact objects in x - ray binary systems have been identified as black holes since a careful analysis has shown that their masses are far beyond any limit accepted for dead stars in general relativity  @xcite . there also exists indirect evidence of the presence of supermassive black holes in the centre of some galaxies  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , unambiguous confirmation of the existence of black holes would require the observation of effects due to the event horizon itself .",
    "this is expected to be achieved through precise measurements of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from black hole accretion disks ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and from the gravitational radiation emitted from companion stars orbiting black holes ( see e.g. @xcite ) . because radiation from sources orbiting black holes plays such a crucial role in modern astrophysics and because increasingly precise measurements are leading to the observation of relativistic effects occurring in the vicinity of the horizon  @xcite , investigation of how radiation - emission processes are modified by the nontrivial curvature and topology of the black - hole spacetime is particularly important .    in this paper",
    "we analyze analytically and numerically the _ scalar _ radiation emitted by a source rotating around a black hole using the framework of quantum field theory at the tree level , and compare the results with those obtained in newtonian gravity and in a theory associated with one - graviton exchange in flat spacetime .",
    "we show that these results coincide asymptotically , as expected , but considerably differ close to the last stable circular orbit .",
    "we also calculate the amount of emitted energy which is not absorbed by the black hole . the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec",
    ": gf ] we present the framework of quantum field theory in which we will work . in section  [ sec : results ] we obtain analytical and numerical results for the emitted power . in section  [ sec : cft ] we establish a connection between our quantum field theory approach and classical field theory . in section  [ sec : cxf ] we compare our curved spacetime calculation with flat spacetime calculations by considering ( i ) newtonian gravity and ( ii ) the one - graviton exchange theory . in section  [ sec : asymptotics ] we calculate analytically and numerically the amount of radiation which is not absorbed by the hole . finally in section  [ sec : final ] we make some remarks on our results .",

    "a nonrotating black hole with mass @xmath2 is described by the schwarzschild line element @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider a circularly moving scalar source at @xmath5 with constant angular velocity @xmath6 ( as measured by asymptotic static observers ) on the plane @xmath7 described by @xmath8 with @xmath9 , where the constant @xmath10 determines the magnitude of the source - field coupling .",

    "we have chosen the initial state @xmath49 to be the boulware vacuum , i.e. @xmath50 . if we had chosen the unruh or hartle - hawking vacuum  @xcite , then ( [ wem ] ) would be associated with the _ net _ radiation emitted from the source since the absorption and stimulated emission rates ( which are induced by the presence of thermal fluxes ) are exactly the same .",
    "note that for sources in constant circular motion the amplitude @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "hence the frequency of emitted waves is constrained by @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath54 , no waves with @xmath55 are emitted .",
    "the general solution of ( [ kg2 ] ) is not easy to analyze  @xcite and therefore we first estimate the radiated power numerically .",

    "we note  @xcite that @xmath87 if @xmath88 is odd and @xmath89 if @xmath88 is even , which is of course time independent .",
    "we have defined @xmath90 if @xmath91 is odd and @xmath92 if @xmath91 is even and @xmath93 .",
    "now , the condition that our source be in a stable circular geodesic implies @xmath94 as is well known  @xcite . by using this formula , @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "can be cast as functions of quantities measured at infinity alone , namely , @xmath97 and @xmath2 . in figure  [ fig02 ]",
    "we plot the total radiated power with fixed angular momentum , @xmath98 , as a function of the angular velocity @xmath97 for different values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 for odd @xmath88 because @xmath87 in this case .",
    "next we consider an analytic approximation valid for low - frequency modes .",
    "let us first recall that waves emitted from circularly moving sources obey the constraint @xmath102 .",
    "thus , waves with @xmath103 ( which turn out to be the most important ones for our purposes ) emitted from sources in stable circular geodesic orbits ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) have maximum frequency @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the maximum of the scattering potential @xmath108 .",
    "hence waves with small angular momentum have small frequencies in comparison with @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 ( see figure  [ fig01 ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis for waves with arbitrary @xmath100 shows that @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , we will consider the approximation where the radial functions are replaced by their leading terms for small @xmath62 ( see equations ( 6.6 ) and ( 7.2 ) in @xcite , and @xcite for a correction ) : @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the legendre functions . by substituting @xmath116 and @xmath58 ( given in equations ( [ q ] ) and ( [ p ] ) respectively ) in ( [ wnum ] ) and a similar expression for @xmath96",

    "[ note that @xmath120 and see discussion above ( [ q ] ) ] .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ fig02 ] that the total radiated power @xmath121 will be dominated by waves with small @xmath99 . for circular",
    "geodesic orbits far enough from the horizon we can use equations ( [ wlmsu])-([whh ] ) to write the radiated power in a simple form : @xmath122",
    "since our calculations are performed at the tree level , our results can be interpreted in classical field theory as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one can show that the energy of a classical field @xmath123 can be written as @xmath124 where the klein - gordon inner product @xmath27 is defined by ( [ klgd ] ) . the classical field generated by a source @xmath125",

    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for other classical - field - theory analyses mainly developed to study gravitational wave emission . )",
    "now we compare the radiated power @xmath130 in schwarzschild spacetime with that in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we consider radiation from a source in circular motion in minkowski spacetime due to the presence of some gravitational force .",
    "the latter should give fairly good results for the case of a source rotating around a star that is not very dense , but not for the case of a source rotating close to a black hole as will be shown .",
    "let us represent the scalar source in minkowski spacetime by @xmath131 where @xmath132 .",
    "we are working here with spherical coordinates defined through the minkowski line element given by ( [ liel ] ) with @xmath133 .",
    "note that the normalization of this source is chosen so that @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the proper three - volume element orthogonal to the world line of the source , as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ meaningful to compare the radiated powers from the sources in schwarzschild and minkowski spacetimes with the same value of @xmath136 .",
    "for this reason , our results will be expressed in terms of @xmath97 .",
    "it is meaningful to compare the radiated powers using @xmath97 because this is a ( coordinate free ) quantity measured by asymptotic observers .",
    "we expand the scalar field as in equation ( [ field ] ) with klein - gordon orthonormalized positive - frequency modes given by ( [ udef ] ) , where the radial functions are given by @xmath137 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which satisfy the differential equation @xmath138 with @xmath139 the total radiated power calculated in minkowski spacetime is @xmath140 where we have used the minkowski vacuum as the initial state . in order to compare this expression with the radiated power",
    "obtained through classical field theory , we adapt the standard derivation of larmor s formula for electric charges ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to the case of scalar sources : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the proper acceleration of the source with an arbitrary trajectory . for circular orbits , we have @xmath143 .",
    "the equality @xmath144 follows from the following formula : @xmath145 ^ 2|y_{lm}(\\pi/2,\\phi)|^2 = \\frac{1}{24\\pi}\\frac{z^2}{(1-z^2)^3}\\;\\ ; , \\label{summation}\\ ] ] for @xmath146 . a proof of this formula is given in the appendix",
    ". we also verified it numerically for a wide range of values of @xmath147 .",
    "now , in order to compare @xmath148 with @xmath149 , we shall cast @xmath150 as a function of @xmath97 by imposing the condition that the scalar source be in circular orbit due to the influence of a gravitational force .",
    "there is no unique way to define a gravitational field in flat spacetime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "assuming newtonian gravity and using kepler s third law @xmath151 in ( [ wemm ] ) , we find @xmath152 as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath153 in figure  [ fig03 ] as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "a similar result is obtained if one considers the gravitational force generated by the one - graviton exchange diagram  @xcite . in this case",
    "a straightforward calculation gives @xmath154 where @xmath155 is defined below equation ( [ jm ] ) . by solving this equation for @xmath150",

    "asymptotically , the radiated power is @xmath158 in either case",

    "the source approaches the last stable orbit , however , our numerical and approximate analytic results show that @xmath160 .",
    "this is not a trivial consequence of redshift since the frequency @xmath97 is measured at infinity in both the schwarzschild and minkowski calculations .",

    "it is seen that very little of the emitted radiation is absorbed by the black hole .",
    "this does not contradict the fact that schwarzschild black holes have a non - negligible absorption cross section for infrared particles  @xcite ( actually of the order of the horizon area ) , because the main contribution to the cross section comes from modes with @xmath173 , which are not emitted by our circularly moving source .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the radiated power from a scalar source rotating around a black hole in the framework of quantum field theory at the tree level .",
    "we have shown that for relativistic circular orbits the emitted power is about 30% and 20% smaller than what would be obtained in newtonian gravity and in flat - spacetime theory with gravitation generated by one - graviton exchange , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that astrophysical processes involving wavelengths of the order of the schwarzschild radius need to be described using fully curved spacetime .",
    "we have also shown that most of the emitted energy escapes to infinity .",
    "clearly , the presence of surrounding matter could trap the emitted radiation in the vicinity of the black hole because of friction effects  @xcite .",
    "these astrophysical issues , however , are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our conclusions are qualitatively in agreement with those obtained for gravitational waves .",
