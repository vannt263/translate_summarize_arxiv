    "generally , discussions of theory of dielectric response begin very formally and derive the lorentz - drude model by introducing a complex dielectric function that gives an out - of - phase damping term . in real space",
    "this corresponds to a spatially and temporally local damping term .",
    "often there is an appeal to the transfer functions of a localized driven damped oscillators as a strong analogy .",
    "however , the driving and damping are due to fields that are being changed by the motion of the charges and it is easy to get lost in the rather formal definitions of the `` macroscopic '' variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    if we were to construct a complete basis of the system one might wonder how there can be any damping at all .",
    "the radiational degrees of freedom combined with the electron oscillations and core vibrations are all that exist in the theory .",
    "quantum statistical mechanics has never adequately reconciled this problem and the kubo formula is a formal approach to derive results @xcite .",
    "classical electrodynamics is the coherent limit of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "losses can take the form of a transition to fields and crystal and collective electronic oscillations that have no classical meaning .",
    "this suggests that the losses that we describe with the imaginary part of the dielectric constant have a purely quantum meaning ( in that they relate to incoherent motion with correlations outside of classical descriptions ) .",
    "there is a long history behind the differences between @xmath4 and @xmath3 and which are viewed as fundamental @xcite .",
    "originally , @xmath5 were considered fundamental because of our use of magnets to generate fields .",
    "now we consider @xmath6 as the fundamental microscopic fields and @xmath7 as some measure of their macroscopic response ( although more general mixing of linear responses than this are possible ) .",
    "we will confine ourselves to the electric case .    in the case of electrostatics",
    ", we define the displacement vector @xmath8 where @xmath9 , the `` permeability of free space '' for vacuum and larger values for media .",
    "this quantity is chosen for the property that @xmath10 so that only the free charges act as sources . in general , solving for the electric field and polarization of the medium would require an iterative self - consistent approach of finding the polarization including the fields from the surface and other uncanceled fields from internal bound charges .",
    "the use of @xmath2 allows many highly symmetric problems to be quickly solved by boundary condition constraints and special functions . we can show that the internal energy density stored in the material is @xmath11 . beyond this ,",
    "its meaning is unclear .",
    "it is certainly not the local spatial average of the electric field in a medium .",
    "it might best be thought of as an intermediary step to finding the polarization as @xmath12 which is a more physically meaningful quantity .",
    "when we seek a response to a time changing field , we generally elevate the dielectric constant to a function of frequency : @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that 1 .   there has been a relaxation of the medium to a state where @xmath14 and @xmath15 obey a constitutive relation ( and",
    "there is only one such branch for a given @xmath16 ) and 2 .",
    "harmonic motion exists as solutions and linear combinations of these give general solutions .",
    "we know that electrostatics is not the low frequency limit of electrodynamics .",
    "( note that e and b fields must both coexist in electromagnetic waves as @xmath17 . )",
    "nonlinear effects at the edges of packets appear which are essential to any discussion of the fourier transformed fields and media response when it comes to momentum conservation .",
    "linear combinations are limited in their ability to capture this aspect of the physics .",
    "while these nonlinear effects can be locally made arbitrarily small by gentler packet gradients , the contributions are additive so can not be neglected this way .",
    "this suggests we will ultimately need to work with purely real space fields to answer such questions thus limiting the value of working with the eigenstate basis .",
    "the extension of the permittivity to complex values is done to consider linear responses that include dissipation .",
    "this could equivalently be done with a real response function that is just @xmath18 out of phase from the electric field .",
    "this distinction matters because extension to the nonlinear domain is not necessarily able to be done using complex fields where real parts are later taken .",
    "we wo nt be interested in such strong fields for this paper but when the nonlinearities are very small there are some simple workarounds @xcite .",
    "the kramers - kronig relations assume that the general response function is in this linear domain @xcite .",
    "the assumption of causality used in this derivation is not the relativistic one but a local one considering the polarization as response of the driving electric field and that this `` response '' temporally follows the driving .",
    "the motivation of this derivation seems to be the response function of a driven damped oscillator .",
    "such an oscillator is a spatially localized system where no space - time relativistic causality problems enter i.e.  there is no evolving `` front '' to observe .",
    "radiation has this as an intrinsic feature and the response radiates out from each point .",
    "furthermore , these fields are constantly getting absorbed and reemitted by radiators to which the `` driver '' of the response , medium or field , is ambiguous .",
    "first , we will consider a dissipationless continuum model of an electromagnetic wave in a medium which makes no such distinctions and incorporates the full degrees of freedom available to the system then consider damping effects later .",
    "we now seek an exactly solvable model based on an idealized solid .",
    "realistic solids are composed of many atoms with essentially fixed cores and outer electronic shells that can oscillate .",
    "the actual displacements of these electrons at microwave frequencies and higher is very small for almost all typical radiation strengths .",
    "this is why the linear regime dominates .",
    "even the nonlinear regime generally exhibits relatively small signals and this is often treated by quantum optical methods where the equations again become linear .",
    "the problem that we run into in modeling the field in realistic solids is that there is already a standing electric field from the cores holding the electrons in place at equilibrium .",
    "this has a complicated structure even for a crystal . on top of this",
    "is the radiation field that will be passing through with possible evanescent local contributions .",
    "the clausius - mossatti relation gives an expression that relates the local atomic polarizability to the mean dielectric response of the medium .",
    "as the wavelengths in the medium become shorter and approach the interparticle separation , the derivation of it becomes less convincing . to get around these complications",
    "we introduce a model made of vertical charged plates so that we have a 2d translational symmetry in our solutions . as a first model we choose the arrangement in fig .",
    "[ plates ] .     and charge @xmath19 .",
    "the negative plates are attached to springs with constant @xmath20 .",
    "the positive plates are fixed by constraint.[plates],width=480 ]        this has a restoring force given by the springs with constant @xmath20 .",
    "there is some ambiguity as to the state of the static electric field between the plates .",
    "the plate pairs have alternately uniform field and zero field between them .",
    "this inhomogeneity does not seem very physical .",
    "closer inspection reveals that displacement of the plates gives strong fringe fields .",
    "these will contribute additional forces to restoring the plates .",
    "it is however causally problematic to have spring forces and fields playing a role at distances to the plates longer than @xmath21 .",
    "we are looking to mock up the role of restoring forces in a realistic solid .",
    "these are due to the deformation energy of deformed orbitals and the static electric fields of the cores on the electrons .",
    "for this reason we consider the modified plate arrangement as in fig .",
    "[ plates1 ] .    this confines the fields between the plates so the large gap regions between them contain no field .",
    "we interpret the springs to be acting locally .",
    "the fringe fields that occur from displacements are spread among the many gaps in the material on a scale much less than @xmath21 of any to - be - considered radiation field .",
    "the restoring forces from displacements are due to the springs and the displacement fields .",
    "these we combine into a net effective force constant @xmath20 .",
    "note that we have not taken the dielectric constant @xmath22 or index of refraction @xmath23 as basic here .",
    "the mass and charge densities per area , @xmath24 , of the moving charges and the elastic response density per area @xmath25 are the primitive microscopic descriptors of the medium .",
    "note that the ratios of of surface densities per plate and corresponding ratios of volume densities , @xmath26 with @xmath27 the density of oscillators , will be the same regardless of @xmath28 , the plate separation since they each satisfy relations of the form @xmath29 .",
    "the advantages of this model are both its symmetry and its ability to let us separate the radiational and nonradiative internal fields in a convenient way . because of the symmetries of the system , the values of the fields are unambiguous in between the plates .",
    "the parcel averaged net field in a medium is not obviously of much value and one has to wonder if the fields will have different values in different media with the same macroscopic dielectric properties .",
    "if so , conservation laws may be the only universal way to describe such systems .",
    "the energy is a quadratic function of the fields so using the regional average of a strongly changing field can miss the correct energy by a large amount .",
    "( we often talk about dielectric response as linear and , in the sense that the elastic response of the charges is in the linear regime it is , but it is not meant to imply that the fields are only slightly changed from the vacuum values .",
    "the changes can be quite large and vary rapidly over short distances . ) in our model , we never need to consider these restoring fields even when radiation is passing through the system . in this case , they are not static but restoring fields yet , assuming the vertical gaps and their separation between each other on the same plate is much smaller than the separation of the plate pairs , they still are clearly distinguishable from the radiation field in these gaps . in the case of a boosted medium",
    "the restoring field picks up magnetic components but the decomposition between these two types of fields is unchanged .",
    "this facilitates a simple consideration of the form of the final dielectric response functions under relativistic transformations .",
    "averaging methods have the problem that the medium is held up by a balance of electrostatic attraction and wavefunction curvature where the unshielded fields inside the electron shells become extremely large .",
    "the internal field of a disturbed solid has both radiative and velocity fields , only the former of which we tend to think of as radiation .",
    "however , when we try to compute how the energy in the system is stored and the response we do it in terms of the field strengths and it then becomes ambiguous if we should use the net or some nonradiationally subtracted local fields to average and if we should average over all of space or to subtract some interior region of the atoms . when it comes to the phase of the radiation it will get strongly distorted from a well defined plane wave on the scale of the atoms .",
    "in this model system , the symmetry of the problem allows a precise decomposition @xmath30 and we can give equations of motion for the @xmath31 henceforth to be called simply @xmath15 .",
    "the phase distortion is replaced by a discrete jump and the singular charge surfaces so that the wavelength and frequency can be well defined between the plates even when the separation @xmath32 ( for example , see fig .",
    "[ wavesteps ] ) .",
    "let us generally assume this plate separation is much smaller than the wavelength @xmath21 of a wave in this vacuum cavity between the plates .",
    "the displacement of the charged plates from equilibrium will be labelled @xmath33 so that the polarization density is @xmath34 .",
    "the current density is related to @xmath33 through @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that a sinusoidal wave is propagating in the x - direction with e - field polarized in the y - direction .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 etc .  for a plates of area @xmath39 .    assuming a sinusoidal solution for the electric field at a given location @xmath40 ( so we can ignore any @xmath41 terms for now ) , @xmath42 and @xmath43 we find @xmath44 the current density @xmath45 is @xmath46 we can now apply maxwell s equations to obtain @xmath47 and using the full space and time dependent ansatz @xmath48 we find the dispersion relation ( see fig .  [ dispersionrelation ] ) :        @xmath49    gives a phase velocity of @xmath50 and , by the definition @xmath51 and index of refraction @xmath52 which is often written in terms of the plasma frequency : @xmath53 so that @xmath54    for completeness we should find the b - field and show consistency of the fields solution .",
    "note that since e and b are perpendicular to the direction of propagation , @xmath55 , and the plates are constrained to move in this plane , we do not need to worry about @xmath56 forces .",
    "these forces are periodic , so cancel @xcite , are additionally an order of @xmath57 smaller than those of @xmath15 but when we wish to consider coupling to phonon oscillations of the medium and damping we should include them .",
    "( in the case of compact packets these magnetic forces will impart net end - of - packet impulses that distinguish between the abraham , total packet including electronic and core , and minkowskii , local internal electromagnetic , definitions of momentum . )",
    "first we solve for the b - field : @xmath58 assuming @xmath59 we find @xmath60 with @xmath61 we get consistency with the equation of motion for @xmath62 and the original maxwell s equations . collecting our solutions",
    "we obtain : @xmath63 with the dispersion relation @xmath64 where @xmath23 is given above .",
    "[ dispersion ] gives a set of four branches of @xmath16 for each @xmath65 .",
    "two are the usual radiationally dominated modes that have @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "there are two other modes that have @xmath17 as @xmath68 . these we might be inclined to call `` acoustic '' modes in analogy with similar results in condensed matter theory .",
    "in contrast with the first two modes these are `` elastically dominated '' ( to be made more clear later ) . if we let the charge density vanish , these modes degenerate to a set of independent oscillators with frequency @xmath69 .",
    "the phase and group velocity of these modes are all less than @xmath57 for the acoustic branch and no singularities occur .",
    "however we notice the singular denominators in @xmath33 and @xmath70 corresponding to @xmath71 the resonant cutoff of the acoustic modes where @xmath65 diverges .",
    "this means a packet would usually contain negligible amounts of such modes .",
    "these give a complete set of variables that allows us to specify any state of the field and medium .",
    "presumably we could expand any packet with vanishing fields , displacements and currents outside a compact set and observe the advance rate of the edge .",
    "before we move on to more subtle considerations , let us address the question of group velocity and the energy and longitudinal momentum transfer in the medium .",
    "our basis did not allow any longitudinal momentum as the plates were constrained in this direction .",
    "this momentum is shared with the elastic modes of the medium which are often very small .",
    "however the duration of a packet can be quite long and variations in its intensity can be on periods where acoustic oscillations can be excited .",
    "our basis requires we include these as an ad hoc modification that connects to these acoustic modes to conserve this momentum .",
    "it is this consideration that will lead to an understanding of the physical meaning of the abraham and minkowskii momenta for this model and will show a very nice built in self - consistency to the theory and a transparency of how momentum and energy are shared between medium and fields and a causal correction for nonlinear and varying damping effects .",
    "from this model we can now compute the local energy density and momentum directly for the progressive wave solutions .",
    "the energy has three sources    1 .",
    "ke of plates 2 .",
    "pe of springs 3 .",
    "energy of fields    this gives the total energy density in eqns .",
    "[ edecomp]-[edecomp1 ] @xmath72 where @xmath73 it is related to the index of refraction by @xmath74 the charge and electromagnetic energy is decomposed here to show that one can view it as static and moving oscillatory components",
    ". this will be useful in later consideration of the phase velocity .",
    "we notice that the oscillatory components of the charge energy is exactly equal , and in phase with , the energy of the electromagnetic waves while the potential energy contribution is out of phase with them leading to a net constant energy density component .    the time averaged energy is @xmath75 using the polarization vector defined by @xmath76 we have @xmath77 so that @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 are contrived here to get the usual relations between energy and displacement .",
    "the poynting vector is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "the transverse work and longitudinal force on the plates are @xmath85    if we now consider time averages of these quantities we obtain : @xmath86    from the dispersion relation we can calculate the group velocity @xmath87 which is always less than c.    one can show @xcite that center of mass and momentum conservation dictate that a packet must move at the group velocity through a uniform medium and carry momentum density @xmath88 .",
    "this is a universal relation for any disturbance that travels as a bound compact unit and leaves the medium undisturbed after it passes .",
    "this does not preclude stresses at the ends of the packet and complicated interactions with surfaces and momentum transfer at boundaries and through antireflective films as such a packet enters the medium .",
    "we can verify this theory in this case by noting that @xmath89 is the momentum density of the electromagnetic field .",
    "consider that the plates carry no net momentum .",
    "it is not just that they are laterally constrained .",
    "the forces in the x - direction average to zero over a cycle .",
    "this means that @xmath90 is all the momentum density there is to the packet .",
    "@xmath89 is the momentum density of the electromagnetic field and since there is no contribution from the electrons due the lateral constraints on the medium and the fact that these forces average to zero for a plane wave , this is the only momentum in the problem .",
    "this lets us immediately verify @xmath91 next we will consider details of the microscopic solution and how stress builds up in the medium and is shared between the charges and the fields .",
    "the abraham - minkowskii controversy revolves around the momentum of an electromagnetic wave in media .",
    "the use of momentum flux is common in treatments of elasticity and hydrodynamics but unlike mass flux ( i.e.  momentum density ) , momentum is not a locally advected quantity ( see app .",
    "[ stressmomentum ] ) .",
    "the pressure plays the role of a source and sink and incompressibility introduces the ability to transport momentum over large distances apparently acausally . from this springs and endless list of sins and accidental successes from the use of pseudomomentum . for completeness , and to avoid such pitfalls , we seek to understand all the local forces and momentum densities in a system . these fall into several types : reflection impulses , pure electromagnetic momentum , longitudinal plate momentum ( that has been excluded from the degrees of freedom in our basis ) , radiative stress from `` hidden '' standing waves , forces from the static / velocity fields and bond distortion that we could term electrostriction , and , most subtle of all , conversion impulses due to momentum absorption of the material while it `` rings up '' to an equilibrium state with the wave .    as mentioned before ,",
    "a real understanding of the system and a universal theory of dielectrics will involve our ability to keep track of the conserved quantities as they propagate through the medium and exchange forces with it .",
    "we will see below that the stress tensor of the combination of medium and electromagnetic field together is not that illuminating but expressing them separately and including the local momentum transfers between them gives the observable impulse induced changes in the medium .",
    "the use of packets is essential in this process .",
    "infinite wave trains can provide exactly solvable solutions but , from the standpoint of conservation laws they can harbor hidden inconsistencies .",
    "two examples are the case of electromagnetic momentum of charged infinite plates in a magnetic field and that of the angular momentum of surface waves . in the first case , the net momentum is cancelled by fringe fields at infinity , which we might suspect since no composed collection of charges with no initial momentum can acquire any . in the second case ,",
    "right moving progressive waves have a ccw angular momentum about the surface , despite cw particle motion but the value of this depends on where boundaries are periodically placed .",
    "hence the angular momentum density is sensitive to boundary conditions at infinity @xcite .    in the case of an electromagnetic packet entering a block ,",
    "[ fig : incident ] , we will see that , even given perfect ar coatings on the surfaces , the medium must acquire part of the momentum of the packet .",
    "there is additionally a stress that exists in the solid at the ends of a packet entirely within the block , fig .",
    "[ fig : enclosed ] .",
    "this is , however , different from the stresses that exist at the end of an infinite wavetrain , fig .",
    "[ fig : traversing ] , or long packet that traverses the block",
    ". we will compare this with the case of a partly in and partly out packet , fig .",
    "[ fig : halfin ] , to demonstrate how the outwards forces on the surface can be present while the medium picks up a net impulse .",
    "we will also investigate the effects of finite time duration of such impulses and how energy can get drained from the packet into acoustic impulses that traverse the block .",
    "the case of electromagnetic waves in media is complicated by the fact that there are two very distinct components : fields and charges . in acoustics and hydrodynamics ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "each has other complications that make them more complicated but in this one respect they are simpler .",
    "progressive surface gravity waves have a number of serious complications not the least of which that they carry mass hence have a nonzero momentum density .",
    "this is generally considered to be a higher order effect and , when it comes to ( the lowest nonrelativistic component of ) energy transport , it can be ignored @xcite .",
    "they will however shed some light on how to consider energy transport and the origins of group and phase velocity from the point of view of conservation laws .    0.4        0.4     0.4     0.4",
    "the small amplitude solution of a deep water surface wave is given by the airy wave with surface profile @xmath92 and velocity potential function @xmath93 with the following dispersion relation : @xmath94 . from this",
    "we derive the phase and group velocities : @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the energy density per unit area is @xmath97 where the energy is equally divided among the kinetic and potential energy .",
    "the kinetic energy comes from the the small circular motion that penetrates down to a depth of @xmath98 .",
    "there is a small higher order drift that we ignore here .",
    "averaged over depth this is a uniform spatial distribution .",
    "the potential energy , however oscillates with position as @xmath99 .",
    "this gives a total energy density of @xmath100 .",
    "the energy density is thus of the form of a constant @xmath101 plus a positive advancing oscillatory function of height @xmath102 .",
    "it seems that the potential energy is transporting at velocity @xmath103 and the kinetic energy is fixed .",
    "the usual interpretation , due to rayleigh , in terms of packets indicates we should have a flux of @xmath104 which , interestingly equals @xmath105 .",
    "when the energy reaches the end of a packet , it produces new elevated regions which do not yet have corresponding kinetic motion to propagate them .",
    "these crests then drive the flows and an analogous effect happens at the back end of the packet .",
    "this gives us a picture of a packet as one where potential energy is transported at @xmath103 and the ends act as sources and sinks that convert half of this back into kinetic energy .",
    "the kinetic energy in the middle is essentially static ( except for a small stokes drift ) .",
    "packet spreading must arise at the ends due to the fact that the pressure created by the surface distribution will extend down and forwards @xmath106 from the packet s end so always leads to some stretching out of surface elevation of the packet .",
    "let us now apply this mode of thinking to our packets of electromagnetic energy in media .",
    "unfortunately , it is not exactly true that the kinetic and potential energy of the charges is static from eqn .",
    "[ oscillations ] .",
    "however , we do have a combination of charge and electromagnetic energy that is constant in eqn .",
    "[ oscillations1 ] . here",
    "we can decompose the net energy as @xmath107 . using @xmath108",
    "we see that a similar interpretation applies here .",
    "it seems that there is a static component that is not moved by the traveling oscillatory crests .",
    "unpublished investigation into other systems by the author suggests this is a very general feature when no net mass flux is present .",
    "since @xmath103 can be greater than @xmath57 this is clearly an imperfect interpretation .",
    "closer inspection shows that there is a back and forth sloshing of the energy that contributes to the oscillating force on the charges .",
    "this oscillating local backwards moving flux of electromagnetic energy explains how the crests of energy above @xmath109 can advance at greater than @xmath57 while the total local energy flux never exceeds it . at this point",
    "one might wonder why we can not simply compute the electromagnetic energy between the plates @xmath110 and use that it advances at the vacuum group velocity , @xmath57 , so that @xmath111 rather than @xmath23 .",
    "the plates themselves can only transfer energy via the em fields so this should be all of the energy flux . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ stress ] below , the phase shifts at the plates necessitate a microscopic backwards flux of energy for a macroscopically simple progressive wave . this generates both a stress on the walls of the medium and a reduced effective electromagnetic energy that advances at @xmath57 .    first let us consider the impulses due to the ar coating , specifically , what is the momentum ( not internal stress ) of these waves in media and what momentum transfer has it exerted on the medium .",
    "( internal stress is not ignorable here and must be considered in any experimental result . in this model",
    "some of this force is hidden at the far off edges of the block in the fringe fields of our plates .",
    "realistic media will generate this from the local velocity fields and changes in the orbitals due to driving .",
    "below we just consider the fraction that arises from global conservation laws . )",
    "we will do this two ways .",
    "first by an explicit calculation then by an analysis of the microscopic fields of a wavetrain traversing the medium .",
    "it is tempting to simply use the lorentz force to compute the forces on the surface using the continuum or constitutive model and be done with it .",
    "unfortunately , this will not always be sufficient for reasons already suggested .",
    "however , we can directly calculate this force of a steady beam at an ar coating .",
    "the details of the ar coating is not important , since the energy flux is constant throughout the system , the impulses at it will not be system dependent .",
    "this is in contrast with the stress on it which may be medium dependent due to other sources of electrostriction .",
    "the difficulties with deriving an exactly solvable calculation @xcite lies in the asymmetry between the two dynamic maxwell s equations . the current term @xmath112 exists in the @xmath113 equation .",
    "we can correct this asymmetry by imposing a magnetic monopole current @xmath114 .",
    "as long as there is no net work done by these current the time averaged impulse will be unchanged . the corresponding maxwell equations are @xcite    @xmath115    we now match the two solutions with the same phase but discontinuously at @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath116 the discontinuities give the implied singular current densities .",
    "@xmath117 the power can be calculated by dotting the midpoint field at @xmath40 with the singular currents @xmath118 .",
    "these vanish since they give opposite contributions .",
    "the averaged ( net outwards ) pressure at the surface is given by @xmath119 this is consistent with the results of mansuripur @xcite derived with considerably more effort .",
    "we next investigate the stress in the medium by investigating the microscopic decomposition of the fields between the plates and show it is consistent with the above result . considering the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : traversing ] , the medium has completed any relaxation and momentum absorption from the advancing action of the packet edge .",
    "the fields in the gaps are made of plane waves with dispersion @xmath120 where these are presumably of a nearly monochromatic form with the same @xmath16 as the macroscopic frequency .",
    "we can decompose the fields here into right and left moving components by first noting that , for analytic waveforms with @xmath121 , we have a traveling wave and removing this component gives a wave moving in the opposite direction .",
    "we start by assuming we have primarily a progressive wave in the x - direction and a standard right handed coordinate system . in the following @xmath15 and @xmath122",
    "are components of these vectors in the induced @xmath123 axes .",
    "this gives a decomposition in to right and left moving component waves .",
    "@xmath124 this decomposition eliminates the cross terms in the stress so that we can write @xmath125 in terms of the respective crossed right and left moving fields .",
    "the corresponding momentum densities are : @xmath126 where @xmath15 has been relabeled as @xmath127 , the field strength between the plates , a distinction we will need shortly .    as a consistency check",
    "we see that @xmath128 .",
    "this is the net momentum density .",
    "the remainder of the momentum is traveling right and left and canceling but still generating a stress and force on the boundaries of the material .",
    "we can think of this microscopically as the momentum as having a free standing wave component with a free propagating wave between each plate .",
    "( an illustration is provided in fig .",
    "[ wavesteps ] ) .",
    "the residual flux gets a magnitude of @xmath129 in each direction so an obstruction reflects with twice this magnitude .",
    "( absorbtion instead of reflection gives half the following result ) .",
    "the stress is therefore : @xmath130 note that @xmath131 here is the field in the vacuum before the packet entered the medium and @xmath127 is the field strength inside the medium .",
    "one could alternately view the role of the plates as inducing a phase shift in the local @xmath15 and @xmath122 fields to the extent that they are well approximated as sections of plane waves of wavevector @xmath132 . defining the crest maxima as @xmath133 and @xmath134 we can define the phase shift @xmath135 mod@xmath136 .",
    "the shifts at each plate gives an infinitesimal shift in the energy and momentum of the waves .",

    "we could attempt to remove these terms by some iteration of lower order approximations to get self consistency ( as it done with the radiation reaction ( see ll ) ) .",
    "it is doubtful if any finite number of spatial derivatives would accomplish the goal of keeping the evolution of the edge bounded by the velocity @xmath228 , as is true for the finite difference equation , and any localized initial data .",
    "infinite order equations are unwieldy and can be argued to be disguised nonlocal equations .",
    "to look at this from a different perspective , consider the current @xmath222 and what it tells us about the velocity of the propagation .",
    "we can decompose this current in to right and left moving components @xmath229 .",
    "we know from above that the velocity of the flux in each direction is @xmath230 where @xmath231 is just the fraction of n from a site that moves right or left respectively . by the above physicality condition we have @xmath232 . if the solution approaches this we know we have moved into unphysical territory i.e.  @xmath217 is `` very large '' but an adjacent value is now approaching zero",
    "this means the flux from one side is effectively terminated and increasing @xmath233 does not increase the flux beyond @xmath234 .",
    "we can best modify fick s law by introducing a scale dependent diffusion constant that drives the diffusion to zero as a function of @xmath235 .",
    "@xmath236 where @xmath237 .",
    "@xmath238 can be as simple as a step function @xmath239 or a smoothed version that still vanishes at @xmath240 .",
    "this introduces some essential nonanalyticity and nonlinearity in the problem .",
    "this is the price we have to pay to preserve the possibility of having a continuous and smooth set of descriptors to evolve the system with the correct dynamical degrees of freedom . in the case",
    "@xmath241 we can immediately see that causality is preserved because the evolution is just the heat equation until the local velocity reaches @xmath242 when it halts until the nearby function changes enough so that it can again evolve at a lower speed . in practice",
    "this state is never reached if @xmath243 is rounded over to a smooth function . as a final note , we see energy is conserved both globally and locally by gauss s law .",
    "it still remains to find a microscopic derivation of the function @xmath238 or even to see what the form of corrections to this model might be .",
    "this will have to remain to future work . to experimentally measure this quantity ,",
    "using the edge of a packet of heat seems extraordinarily difficult .",
    "one could probe rapidly brought together surfaces with large temperature differences . for diffusion",
    ", one could look for rapidly moving outliers and large number averages .",
    "nonlinear equations follow as descriptions of truly linear phenomena when we suppress dimensionality e.g.  the schrdinger equation and hartree - fock , density functional theory and the gross - pitaevskii equations . in the case of quantum field theory ,",
    "nonlinearities show up in the running of the coupling constant as a result of suppressing scales that correspond to energies beyond what is physically relevant for the given problem . here",
    "we have shown that nonlinearities follows from neglected ( and apparently intractable to the analytic tools of smoothing and taking limits ) small scale and discrete physics when we need to work with a best fit continuum model .",
    "it is interesting to note that equations like the porous medium equation @xmath244 with @xmath245 give a set of weak solutions ( essentially continuous solutions with smoothness discontinuities ) that have finite velocity of front propagation .",
    "we can see that these also have a vanishing current where @xmath23 approaches zero .",
    "in contrast we have sought a solution where the velocity of propagation is bounded by a physically fundamental quantity .",
    "if we were to extend this to heat transport in a solid we note that the phonons are bounded by the velocity of sound .",
    "as long as we are at temperatures where the relevant phonons are from the linear part of the dispersion relation , we can expect such an equation to be relevant .",
    "the gas of heat flow in gases is more complicated .",
    "the particles can have a very broad distribution of velocities .",
    "this above result would have to use contribution over bounds from all these velocities and the sharp edge we see above would become blurred .",
    "even though sound speed is closely related to the thermal mean velocity the `` thermal edge '' of the heat distribution would creep out beyond it .",
    "the speed of light bound will be established once a relativistic distribution of particle speeds is used .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of a system @xmath246 is often described as the flux of @xmath247 momentum across the @xmath248th hypersurface composed of normals to the vector @xmath249 .",
    "this is a common approach in many texts on continuum mechanics .",
    "since we are interested in the microscopic interplay between material and radiation in a way that treats neither as the `` driver '' or `` responder , '' as is generally done in derivations of the kramers - kronig relations , it is good to pause and look at some specific cases from a microscopic point of view .    in the case of a gas , the above",
    "is a good model .",
    "all the pressures and stresses in the medium are the results of kinetics . as such , these are the direct result of microscopic transfer of momentum .",
    "the case of solids and liquids are different .",
    "there is a kinetic component but there is also potential energy in the bonds between atoms that can be strained and do the work of transferring forces across the parcels .",
    "this may seem academic but when we look at some formulations of momentum conservation in continua , we can start to consider the naively implied `` momentum flux '' from such a @xmath246 as though it is a conserved quantity .",
    "specifically @xmath250 implies a conserved momentum ( since @xmath251 ) however the conservation law @xmath252 ( or @xmath253 ) is not generally true even when external forces are zero .",
    "( note that for constant density fluids @xmath254 we can rewrite this as @xmath255 for @xmath256 .",
    "this is the correct eulerian momentum flux in the lab frame assuming any microscopic motions can be neglected .",
    "we generally refer to these fluids as `` incompressible '' but one can have fluids with varying density e.g.  from varying solute concentration where each parcel is effectively incompressible so `` constant density '' is more accurate here . ) this is what we would expect for a conserved momentum .",
    "instead we see that @xmath257 plays the role of a source and sink term for it .",
    "momentum is exactly conserved and , absent any electromagnetic contribution , is the same as the mass density flux .",
    "the subtleties with momentum flux is that it is not locally conserved and that one often tries to write forces as momentum fluxes that may partially cancel on a given material parcel . during a microscopic evaluation of the sample one only sees bond strain and net motion .",
    "the net result is the same net force but momentum flux in this sense has no microscopic meaning .    if we consider a gas we can locally keep track of the momentum of the system and how it shifts at each collision .",
    "in fact we can give a locally well defined right and left moving momentum flux .",
    "in the case of condensed matter , this is not the case and the elastic forces driven by the potential energy must be included in the microscopic description of the stress . inspecting a stressed zero temperature solid",
    "microscopically will indicate the strained bonds but no momentum is being transferred .    when the fields exist in the presence of media we can lump the net local stress into a stress tensor .",
    "it is not clear how valuable this is since the waves might propagate through the medium for some distance before it relaxes .",
    "we generally try to use such stress tensors to take gradients to derive local forces",
    ". these must be the net forces on particles and fields .",
    "if this induces reflection and packets do not evolve as we expect from linear combination of the states in a dispersion law it is not clear how much each one responds to this .",
    "when electromagnetic fields are being included , we need to include its momentum .",
    "how to decouple these from media is not entirely obvious for realistic media .",
    "several respectable sources have promoted some confusion about the nature of the `` canonical '' momentum of a particle in an electromagnetic wave @xcite and this ends up playing a role in some discussions of the meaning of the abraham and minkowskii momentum in media @xcite .",
    "since it is easy to clarify we shall do it here .",
    "the canonical momentum of a particle is stated as @xmath258 .",
    "( gaussian units are used in this paragraph . )",
    "there are attempts to use this and other pseudomenta to give true forces at gradients or boundaries .",
    "some discussion has taken place as to when this is valid @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the gauge problem and this proposed definition .",
    "clearly it is not invariant .",
    "we know that these problems go away in the case of the schrdinger equation because the phase of the wave transforms to cancel any vector potential gauge change .",
    "in this case we have @xmath259 .",
    "the gauge transformation of @xmath260 is now compensated by a stretching in the phase , @xmath261 , of the wavefunction . by ehrenfest s theorem",
    ", a localized packet moving with with velocity @xmath262 continues along the lorentz force law path . to get the original canonical relation to give the true momentum we need to choose and maintain a gauge choice of @xmath263 at each particle .",
    "the wavefunction packet constitutes a model for the classical charged particle to the extent the ( in this case , irremovable ) self - forces can be neglected .",
    "since @xmath264 is a gauge invariant quantity , the classical canonical momentum really only coincides with this gauge restricted case . in this model",
    ", @xmath262 is a function of the phase gradient of the packet and the particular value of @xmath265 chosen for the given magnetic field .",
    "any modification of this vector potential by a gauge choice @xmath266 should leave @xmath267 unchanged and give no new forces on the particle .",
    "this implies that the only classical `` canonical '' transformation of the momentum that should be allowed obey the same local constraints i.e.  @xmath268 at each charge .",
    "the author acknowledges helpful feedback from david aspnes .",
    "we properly should consider the elastic coupling of the electrons to the cores and the cores to each other as distinct .",
    "the time scale of these oscillating forces and responses determine how much momentum is taken up by electrons alone versus electrons and cores together .",
    "this creates a distinction between a plasmon - like and acoustic modes .",
    "these vibrations will create an elastic stress on the bonds , hence the medium , despite having no net longitudinal momentum contributions .",
    "the inclusion of such modes will increase the number of branches in the dispersion relation .",
    "the model we have here of uniform plates will be replaced by separated localized oscillators in realistic media .",
    "these are characterized not only by mass , charge and elastic response but cross section .",

    "<S> is discussed . a microscopic treatment of negative index materials from this point of view is included as an illustration of the extreme economy and simplicity of these methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the abraham - minkowskii paradox has led to a century long debate on the proper assignment of momentum to electromagnetic waves in media @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> minkowskii argued that the momentum of a photon should be @xmath0 and abraham as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> some now argue that this is now resolved and both assignments are correct when boundary conditions are correctly applied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this article is not so much to dispute that position but to view this problem and general dielectric response from a different and more intuitive point of view . </S>",
    "<S> this will generally support a unique decomposition of momentum into field and material components but also ultimately challenges the universality of such stresses as a function of the dielectric response . </S>",
    "<S> the physical questions we can ask of an electromagnetic wave interacting with a dielectric medium are 1 .  </S>",
    "<S> what are the forces at the surfaces ? 2 .  </S>",
    "<S> what stresses exist due to a steady state beam traversing the medium ? </S>",
    "<S> 3 .  what are the impulses ( and transient losses ) associated with a wave packet traversing the medium ? </S>",
    "<S> 4 .  how many photons are involved and how does this change at boundaries ? 5 .  what are causal , damping and nonlinear ( and nonlocal ) effects on propagation ? to be able to answer such questions , hopefully easily and with physical intuition , is a sign that we truly do understand the system and are in a good position to extend the theory to more challenging configurations that can arise from nonlinearity , confined geometries and quantum effects .    in this article , we will see that the energy and momentum in the photons in a particularly simple medium can be unambiguously specified and separated from that in the charge and core motions . </S>",
    "<S> internal stresses can be identified with phase shifts / time lags at the charges and induced standing waves in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the phase velocity turns out to be the rate at which the spatially oscillating part of the energy density advances . </S>",
    "<S> the group velocity will be the velocity that the total energy of the packet , including the energy of the charges , propagates which will involve conversion of charge kinetic and potential energy at the ends . in the nondissipative case </S>",
    "<S> , the resonant limit gives diverging stress and ratio of charge energy to electromagnetic wave energy . </S>",
    "<S> elastic medium response can absorb large fractions of the electromagnetic momentum that is typically returned when the field leaves the medium but , for rapidly changing packets , intense fields or large media , the induced acoustic motions can drain energy from the waves in an unrecoverable fashion . </S>",
    "<S> this is just one sort of nonlinearity that media can display and will lead us to a general discussion of nonlinearity and causality in media from a physical point of view rather than the formal approaches used in the kramers - kronig relations .    </S>",
    "<S> one might wonder why one should pursue such a reformulations of the established treatments of dielectric response . </S>",
    "<S> one reason is the frustrating and persistent problems that pseudomomentum and pseudostress introduce into physics @xcite . even those bent on resolving these conflicts often add new elements to the confusion . by providing a system that can be exactly parsed locally in terms of conserved quantities </S>",
    "<S> one can clarify exactly where the real momentum is , how it is transferred and what the possibilities are for real stresses . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , there is pedagogical value . </S>",
    "<S> one should not confuse agreement with experiment as a correct derivation . </S>",
    "<S> it is often joked that graduate students can derive whatever you ask them to by some means . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of us are beyond finding overly clever and hopeful derivations based on pleasant seeming abstraction to obtain a known or suspected result . to be able to attack a problem from multiple directions is a great comfort that our results are valid even when some arguments seem too clever and might belong more in the domain of mathematics than physics .    </S>",
    "<S> many students express frustration that the treatment of dielectric response suddenly involves the tools of complex analysis , often their first introduction to it , and wonder why an explanation must require such a formal approach . </S>",
    "<S> physicists and mathematicians may differ on what the more `` fundamental '' sort of treatment means . </S>",
    "<S> most physics students would consider a microscopic description of the medium to be the most illuminating and natural since it has a clear connection to the fundamental laws of motion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the complexity of such treatments is generally out of reach of their time and ability and have their own approximations that leave room for doubt . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one has the feeling that this is a simple classical problem by nature and it should not require hard tools or wild leaps from the case of single driven oscillators to have an intuitive answer to medium response .    in the following , we will introduce an exactly solvable model that shows that the energy transfer entirely consists of the electromagnetic flux where the ends of packets act as sources and sinks of this in terms of charge kinetic and elastic bond energy . </S>",
    "<S> this then gives a very nice consistency condition with conservation laws and the allowed dispersion relations that are related to a similar result for surface waves , a much more complicated system . </S>",
    "<S> delightfully , this approach is not just intuitive but also mathematically rudimentary , brief and leads to some new insight on the ways nonlinearity must essentially enter these systems . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , momentum effects can be exactly separated and classified as : reflection impulses , pure electromagnetic flux , longitudinal plate momentum , radiative stress , forces from the static / velocity fields and bond distortion and conversion impulses due to the `` rings up '' time of the medium to create an equilibrium state with the wave . during this ring - up , </S>",
    "<S> the medium is absorbing energy ( hence momentum ) from the propagating wave so that the forces on it are not a simple function of the instantaneous fields which means deriving the forces from a stress tensor built from them must fail in general . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the rest of the internal stress in the medium is due to a hidden standing wave component between the layers due to a phase shift induced by the charges .    </S>",
    "<S> the linearized theory of medium response gives a consistent causal theory even though some aspects of induced stress and conservation laws are obscured . </S>",
    "<S> how to handle nonlinearities as extra interactions on a basis built from a linearized theory is not always obvious . </S>",
    "<S> formal procedures exist in the form of perturbation theory and path integrals @xcite but the domain where this is valid and applicable is not always clear . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , the case of water surface waves is quite troublesome . </S>",
    "<S> a broad enough spectral distribution can lead to local fluctuations large enough to induce surface breaking which introduce vorticity and remove energy , momentum and angular momentum from the waves and convert it to heat , nonirrotational flow and angular momentum of the gravitational source . </S>",
    "<S> the end - of - packet contributions of optical signals in media will be seen to necessarily give nonlinear contributions as a function of the medium s elasticity independent of the extent to which the restoring forces are becoming nonlinear . </S>",
    "<S> the internal properties of a medium can easily be induced to change rapidly in real time so that no well defined basis of eigenstates , even including acoustic response , can span the solution . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we will present a general local theory that includes damping and nonlinearity for which causality manifestly holds . </S>",
    "<S> ( nonlocality due to a sparse phonon spectrum will not be included since this will create a kind of incoherence among photons that is not describable by a classical theory . ) </S>",
    "<S> this allows the introduction of any local damping law and medium response restricted only by conservation laws that are clear from the initial form of the equations .    </S>",
    "<S> the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ comment ] we comment on the lorentz - drude model and the vagueness in it that makes extracting forces from it difficult . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exact ] , we create an exactly solvable model that gives these results in the nondissipative limit in a fashion that allows an exact decomposition and tracking of energy and momentum as it moves through the medium . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ impulseandstress ] to explicitly describe the forces that must exist at boundaries , ends of packets and the time delays that must occur in energy transfer from radiative field to medium . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we can estimate acoustic losses to the medium , photon number changes in the medium ( from purely classical considerations ! ) and forces on anti - reflective coatings . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , we exploit that the momentum flux conservation implies the result must be universal for any medium and show that this can be calculated with extraordinary economy by introducing magnetic monopole currents . in sec .  [ damping ] </S>",
    "<S> , we show how this model can be extended to introduce damping and nonlinear effects which completely respect causality and then show that this model is not completely universal but is , in some sense , minimal in its account of energy and forces in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> an appendix covers the extension of the model to `` left handed '' materials , where group and phase velocities are opposite . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation field is shown to consist entirely of photon fields that move opposite to the phase velocity of the electric field vector that is smoothed over many radiator spacings . </S>",
    "<S> another appendix discuss causality in diffusive systems as another example of how correct small scale accounting fixes the apparent superluminal problems introduced by continuum mechanical limits . </S>",
    "<S> the final appendix discusses some subtle points on stress tensors and why they may be of limited value in describing the forces on an optical media in the presence of radiation . </S>"
