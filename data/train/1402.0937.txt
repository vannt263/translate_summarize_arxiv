    "the celebrated rigorous proof of conformal invariance of the ising model @xcite spurred renewed interest in the application of discrete complex analysis to two - dimensional critical lattice models . the approach has inspired mathematical proofs for a number of notable results in statistical physics . for the ising model , these include the conformal invariance of spin correlations @xcite and the energy density @xcite and the existence of the scaling limit of domain walls @xcite . for self - avoiding walks on the hexagonal lattice",
    ", proofs have been given for the connective constant @xcite and the critical fugacity of surface adsorption @xcite .",
    "of course , the solvability of these problems ought , ultimately , to be ascribed to the integrability @xcite of the models . in a parallel development , it was discovered that a weakening of the condition of discrete holomorphicity , namely , imposing only the condition of vanishing discrete contour sum , is obeyed by a class of parafermionic observables on the lattice for a wide variety of models such as the potts @xcite , the @xmath2 @xcite and the @xmath0 loop @xcite models , both in the bulk @xcite and with a boundary @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , for these observables , the condition holds only on the integrable critical manifold of the boltzmann weights , warranting a deeper understanding of the connection between integrability and holomorphicity . in this paper",
    ", we refer to this weak form of holomorphicity only as discrete holomorphicity for simplicity .",
    "subsequently , we showed @xcite that for fateev - zamolodchikov self - dual @xmath2 models @xcite , discrete holomorphicity necessarily implies yang - baxter integrability conditions . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the generality of the connection by showing that analogous arguments hold for the loop models . the integrable structure in the cases considered here",
    "can alternatively be understood as arising from the quantum group @xcite structure . in @xcite ,",
    "the relevant parafermions were identified as non - local conserved currents @xcite corresponding to this symmetry with their conservation law given by the condition of discrete holomorphicity .",
    "this approach leads directly to the yang - baxter equation by exploiting the associativity of the algebra .",
    "our approach here , however , is focused on the connection with the @xmath1-invariance @xcite of these models .",
    "the holomorphic observable , remarkably , also has close connections @xcite to the combinatorial approach @xcite for the special case of the ising model .    in we present our results for the critical potts model in its dense loop formulation , that is , we derive the inversion relation and the yang - baxter equation from the condition of holomorphicity , and in we extend the results to the @xmath0 dilute loop model . in we present an alternative characterization of the observables which uses the @xmath1-invariance of the model to define the observables on the boundary for the whole equivalence class of baxter lattices sharing that boundary .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the @xmath3-state critical potts model on a planar graph can be mapped to a dense loop model defined on its medial graph .",
    "we call a face of the covering graph ( the planar dual of the medial graph ) a plaquette and the edge of the original graph on which the plaquette is placed its axis .",
    "each closed loop gets a statistical weight @xmath4 and each plaquette can have on it one of two configurations with weights @xmath5 and @xmath6 that depend on the interaction energy of its axis .",
    "we represent the @xmath7-matrix graphically as a formal linear combination of the configurations , or the connectivities , on the plaquette , which are essentially the 2 possible pairings between the 4 midpoints of the sides , @xmath8{figure1 } } } } \\;=\\ ; a_\\alpha\\;\\ ; { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[{scale=1.25}]{figure2}}}}\\;+\\;b_\\alpha \\;\\ ; { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[{scale=1.25}]{figure3}}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the spectral parameter with a normalization yet to be fixed .",
    "the axis connects two opposite corners of the plaquette , one of which is marked with a tag to track the orientation of the plaquette . for a rhombic embedding of the covering graph on the plane , we call the angle at this corner the opening angle of the plaquette . for the model to be integrable",
    ", the weights must satisfy the yang - baxter equation @xmath10{figure4 } } } } = { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[{angle=90}]{figure5}}}}\\ ] ] as well as the inversion relation , @xmath11{figure6 } } } } = { \\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[{}]{figure7}}}}\\ ] ]    the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite allows formal expansion of the diagrams in the 5 possible connectivities , also known as chord diagrams , that correspond to the different pairings between 6 points ( ) .",
    "in general , the number of pairings @xmath12 of @xmath13 points on a circle by non - intersecting chords is known as the @xmath14 catalan number in combinatorics .",
    "the resulting relations are @xmath15 respectively , where the normalization of the spectral parameters is @xmath16 suggesting a possible interpretation as angles .",

    "the thick curve is the exploration path that runs from @xmath18 to @xmath19 and has @xmath20 lying on it .",
    "the shaded plaquettes correspond to the vertical , and the white plaquettes to the horizontal edges in the original potts spin model .",
    "the marked angles at the lower left corner show that the opening angles of the two classes or rhombi are supplimentary .",
    "the winding angle is the total angle that the curve turns to get from @xmath18 to @xmath20 , which , in this configuration , is zero . ]",
    "a discretely holomorphic observable @xcite of the model , for a rhombic embedding of the covering lattice on the complex plane , is defined on the midpoint of the sides of the plaquettes , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is a real constant called the conformal spin of the observable , @xmath23 is the set of all the configurations having a curve , called the exploration path , between two fixed points @xmath18 and @xmath19 on the boundary with @xmath20 lying on it , @xmath24 is the weight of the configuration @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the winding angle of the exploration path going from @xmath18 to @xmath20 ( ) . that is , on each plaquette it obeys @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are the differences in complex coordinates of the endpoints of the side @xmath20 is on , traversed in the anticlockwise direction around the rhombus @xmath29 .",
    "consequently such a sum around any closed path on the covering lattice vanishes to give a discrete analogue of cauchy s integral theorem for holomorphic functions .    to establish the claim , ikhlef and cardy @xcite considered the contour sum around a single rhombic plaquette with opening angle @xmath9 , breaking up the configuration into two parts for the interior and the exterior of the rhombus respectively , and grouping the terms by the exterior configuration , which thus for the purposes of the argument can be thought of as frozen henceforth , and then by the point of first entry into the rhombus for the curve .",
    "therefore it suffices for the sum to vanish for each of these groupings individually . defining an auxiliary function @xmath30 for notational convenience , we have , for the two possible connectivities of the external configurations ( ) , @xmath31 for non - trivial solutions to exist ,",
    "the determinant of the system must vanish , and we take the factors of the determinant independent of @xmath9 to be zero , so that the condition is satisfied on all rhombuses , to obtain @xmath32 and therefore , @xmath33 which results in a family of solutions labelled by an integer @xmath34 , @xmath35 all of which satisfy the integrability condition as shown below .",
    "the standard solution @xmath36 , @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 , and lets us identify the angle , in this case , as a ( re - scaled ) spectral parameter , @xmath39 it was observed long ago @xcite that this is the required embedding of the anisotropic lattice for correlations to be conformally , or more simply , rotationally , invariant .",
    "the criticality condition @xmath40 can be immediately verified , and enables the identification of these supplementary weights to be the dual weights in the other lattice direction ( ) .",
    "thus the role of the crossing parameter is played by @xmath41 in this normalization .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     once the integrability conditions are derived from the holomorphicity condition , however , an alternative explanation of the proof can be deduced . inside a baxter lattice",
    ", we consider a sublattice @xmath42 , and modify it by reidemeister moves of the rapidity lines that leave the exterior of the sublattice unaltered ( ) , to obtain another sublattice @xmath43 . with our identication of rapidity parameters with transversals in",
    ", the boundary of the sublattices in a rhombic embedding remains the same , and we denote it by @xmath44 .",
    "the effect of the modifications on the embedding is to shuffle rhombuses around , as is evident from .",
    "now compare , for the two sublattices , the observable at a midpoint @xmath20 on @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for either of the two sublattices , and @xmath47 is the subset of @xmath48 for which @xmath5 is the point of entry of the exploration path into the interior .",
    "clearly , it suffices to show that the quantity in parentheses is equal for the two sublattices to prove that @xmath49 and consequently , for every member of the equivalence class of the sublattices , and hence , @xmath50 is unambiguously defined on @xmath44 , independent of its interior lattice structure .",
    "the exterior common to the two sublattices can be factored out by grouping the terms by the configurations on it , which fixes the value of the winding angle up to @xmath5 , and thus can be factored out .",
    "the only information we need about this configuration is then its connectivity given by a chord diagram appropriate for the model , which we refer to as the external chord diagram .",
    "note that for the dilute model , the diagrams that connect @xmath5 to another point on @xmath44 are not allowed as external diagrams .",
    "hence we are left with comparing , for the two sublattices , @xmath51 where a given external diagram is imposed .",
    "here @xmath52 is the set of interior configurations on the sublattice @xmath46 where @xmath20 and @xmath5 lie on the same curve , possibly going through both the interior and the exterior of the sublattice .",
    "this time we group the terms in the sum by the internal chord diagrams , that is , the connectivity between the points on @xmath44 in the internal configurations , for the comparison . for each group ,",
    "the winding angles are the same because the curve follow identical chords on both of the chord diagrams which , by the existence of the common boundary @xmath44 , have well - defined winding angles for each segment of the curve joining two points on it .",
    "the quantity left to compare is the sums of weights of all configurations with the same chord diagrams for the two sublattices . since the external and internal chord diagrams together determine the number of closed loops between them , this is equivalent to comparing the partition functions of the two lattices , which are identical due to the @xmath1-invariance guaranteed by the integrability conditions already proven .",
    "note that even though not all of the configurations in the definition of the observable in the dilute loop model is allowed in the partition function , the internal configurations are all allowed since the open path ends on its boundary .",
    "we thus have the invariance of the observable on the boundary under reidemeister moves of the rapidity lines inside , or equivalently , local reshuffling of rhombuses in the embedding .",
    "this provides another characterization of the observables besides discrete holomorphicity .",
    "it is interesting to note that discrete holomorphicity then provides linear relations among partition functions with different chord diagrams on the same lattice , whereas the integrability conditions show the equality of partition functions with the same chord diagram on different lattices . of course ,",
    "for just one rhombus , the partition functions with different chord diagrams are just the boltzmann weights themselves .",
    "in summary , discrete holomorphicity of the observables , on simply - connected domains tiled by convex rhombuses , generates linear equations between the partition functions with different internal connectivities of the boundary points . for one rhombus ,",
    "these are linear equations in the weights , which are solved by finding the conformal spin by setting the determinant of the system of equations to zero . for two rhombuses ,",
    "these equations are quadradic in the weights , and imply the inversion relation . for three rhombuses , they imply the yang - baxter relation . in general , for a domain with @xmath53 rhombuses ,",
    "the linear equation is among degree @xmath53 homogeneous polynomials in the weights . with the integrability conditions satisfied",
    ", the @xmath1-invariance of the models defines the observable on the boundary of the domain for the equivalence class of baxter lattices .",
    "we note , however , that unlike the case of cauchy s integral formula , @xmath54 the values of the observable on the boundary do not uniquely specify the values in the interior .",
    "as was explained in @xcite , this is because the number of variables , that is the number of midpoints of the sides of the rhombuses , far exceeds the number of equations , that is , one equation of holomophicity per rhombus .",
    "the observable defined on the ising model @xcite , of course , is the glaring exception .",

    "the following subset suffices , @xmath55    in addition , to utilize the symmetries of the @xmath56 functions , we make the following replacements whenever the left hand sides occur in the calculations , @xmath57    we ignore isolated points for the values of @xmath58 to keep the proof general , although the special cases can be handled similarly , or using the continuity of the @xmath59 functions and the weights .",
