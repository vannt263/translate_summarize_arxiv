    "simulation , especially markov chain monte carlo , is close to putting elementary probability ( feller volume i - style ) out of business .",
    "this was brought home to me recently in an applied study : lauren banklader , marc coram , and i were studying `` smooshing cards , '' a widely used mixing scheme where a deck of cards is slid around on the table by two hands .",
    "how long should the sliding go on to adequately mix the cards ? to gather data , we mixed 52 cards for a minute and recorded the resulting permutations 100 times .",
    "why would nt these permutations be random ?",
    "our first thoughts suggested various tests : perhaps there would be too many cards that started adjacent that were still adjacent ; perhaps the cards originally close to the top would stay close to the top ;  .",
    "we listed about ten test statistics . to carry out tests",
    "requires knowing the null distributions .",
    "i  could see how to derive approximations using combinatorial probability , for example , for a permutation @xmath0 , consider @xmath1 .",
    "this has an approximate @xmath2 distribution with a reasonable error available using stein s method @xcite . for @xmath3 the length of the longest increasing subsequence , some of the deepest advances in modern probability @xcite allow approximation .",
    "marc and lauren looked at me as though i was out of my mind : `` but we can trivially find null distributions by simulations and know useful answers in an hour or two that are valid for @xmath4 . ''",
    "sigh , of course they are right ,",
    "so what s a poor probabilist to do ?",
    "one way i have found to go forward has been to study the algorithms used in simulation .",
    "this started with an applied problem : to investigate the optimal strategy in a card game , a programmer had generated millions of random permutations ( of 52 ) using 60 random transpositions .",
    "i was sure this was too few ( and the simulated results looked funny ) .",
    "this suggests the math question , `` how many random transpositions are needed to mix @xmath5 cards . ''",
    "with mehrdad shahshahani @xcite we proved that @xmath6 are necessary and suffice to get @xmath7 close to random . for @xmath4 , it takes 400500 .",
    "in retrospect , this is indeed using probability to investigate properties of an algorithm .",
    "i ve never worried about finding worthwhile problems since then .",
    "the literature on careful analysis of markov chain mixing times is large .",
    "a splendid introduction @xcite , the comprehensive @xcite , and the useful articles by laurent saloff - coste @xcite give a good picture .",

    "the details vary and the arguments require new ideas .",
    "once one finds such a phenomenon , it is natural to study things more carefully .",
    "for example , is `` almost all @xmath39 '' needed ? in @xcite it is shown that the answer is yes : there are infinitely many primes @xmath39 such that @xmath59 steps are necessary and sufficient .",
    "hildebrand @xcite shows that one can not replace @xmath60 by 1 in the theorem . in @xcite",
    "similar walks are studied on other groups .",
    "i have heard several stories about how adding a single extra move to a markov chain speeded things up dramatically .",
    "this seems like an important area crying out for development .",
    "for example , in the `` lattice points inside a convex set @xmath22 '' of section  [ sec1 ] , is there an analog of deterministic doubling which speeds up the ( diam)@xmath61 rate ? the reflection walks of @xcite for the original metropolis problem of random placement of non - overlapping hard discs in a box is an important speed - up of local algorithms .",
    "can it be abstracted ?",
    "consider again generating a random point in @xmath62 by a local algorithm .",
    "in joint work with holmes and neale @xcite the algorithm of figure  [ fig2 ] was suggested . along the top ,",

    "intuitively , it moves many steps in one direction before switching directions ( with probability @xmath64 ) .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that this walk takes just @xmath5 steps to reach stationarity ( and this is best possible for such a local algorithm ) .",
    "the analysis shows that this is a hidden version of the @xmath65 walk with @xmath66 or @xmath67 with probability @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the walk was developed as a toy version of the hybrid monte carlo algorithm of lattice field theory  @xcite .",

    "this is a general and broadly useful class of algorithms that have resisted analysis .",
    "someone should take up this challenge ! [ ex3 ]    there has been some further development of the ideas in @xcite .",
    "chen , lovsz and pak @xcite abstracted the idea to a `` lifting '' of general markov chains .",
    "they showed that the square - root speed - up ( order @xmath17 to order @xmath5 in the example ) was best possible for their class of algorithms .",
    "hildebrand @xcite studied the lifted version of the metropolis algorithm ( based on nearest neighbor random walk on @xmath68 ) for a general stationary distribution .",

    "the results of this section show that real speed - ups of standard algorithms are possible .",
    "these results should have practical consequences : even if it is hard to prove , it is usually easy to find a few `` big moves '' that preserve the stationary distribution . for a survey of approaches to designing algorithms that avoid diffusion , see @xcite",
    "one of the joys of proving things is that , sometimes , things that `` everybody knows '' are nt really true .",
    "this is illustrated with three examples : systematic vs. random scans , cutting the cards , and cooking potatoes .",

    "the gibbs sampler proceeds by updating one coordinate at a time .",

    "uniform choices ) better ?",
    "`` everybody knows '' that systematic scans are better . yet , in the only cases where things can be proved , random scan and systematic scan have the same rates of convergence . [ ex4 ]",
    "two classes of examples have been studied .",

    "a number of other scanning strategies and walks on different groups confirm the finding : being systematic does nt help to change the order of magnitude of the number of steps needed for convergence .",

    "how should vertices be chosen to get rapid mixing ?",
    "systematic scan periodically cycles through the vertices in a fixed order .",
    "random scan chooses vertices uniformly .",

    "it suggests a research program ; a survey of the literature on scanning strategies is in @xcite .",
    "at least , someone should find one natural example where systematic scan dominates .",
    "does cutting the cards help mixing ?",
    "i find it surprising that the answer is `` not really and it can even slow things down . ''",
