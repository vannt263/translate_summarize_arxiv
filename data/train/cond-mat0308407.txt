    "in these three lectures we will try to give a somewhat deeper understanding of concepts commonly used to interpret experimental data on the quantum hall effect .",
    "some of the ideas presented here are neither commonly used nor commonly appreciated by active researches and by referees for major journals . in particular , we hope to make clear why the chern  simons ( cs ) mean field ( mf ) approximation correctly predicts the structure of the lowest band of energy states for any value of the applied magnetic field @xmath1 , despite introducing an energy scale that is large but totally irrelevant to the determination of that structure . we demonstrate that by adding the cs flux to each electron adiabatically ( the way laughlin originally created laughlin quasiparticles ( qp s ) using his imaginary infinitesimal solenoid ) instead of via a gauge transformation , no change in particle statistics results for any value of the added flux , but laughlin correlations among the resulting composite fermions ( cf s ) arise automatically .",
    "( cf s are electrons together with their attached cs flux tubes . )",
    "the equivalence of cf s and laughlin correlations is important to realize .",
    "the pseudopotential @xmath2 , i.e. the energy of interaction of a pair of electrons , each with angular momentum @xmath3 on a haldane spherical surface , depends on the total pair angular momentum @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , called the _ relative _ angular momentum of the pair , must be an odd integer .",
    "a very useful by largely unnoticed theorem on pair angular momentum can be used to show that a harmonic pseudopotential of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath1 are constants , introduces no correlations . for a harmonic potential the energy @xmath8 of every total angular momentum multiplet",
    "@xmath9 is the same for every multiplet that has the same value of @xmath10 .",
    "this means any linear combination of multiplets with the same value of @xmath10 has the same energy .",
    "laughlin correlations occur only for _ superharmonic _ pseudopotentials in which @xmath11 is positive , so that large values of @xmath12 ( and large repulsion ) are avoided .",
    "the pseudopotential for higher landau levels ( ll s ) is not superharmonic at the largest value of @xmath12 ( or at the smallest value of @xmath5 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "because of this fact laughlin correlations do not occur for filling factors satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "instead , electrons tend to form pairs with the smallest allowed size in order to avoid states with large pair amplitude at @xmath15 .",
    "the composite fermion hierarchy of condensed states was based on the reapplication of the cs flux attachment to qp s in partially filled cf shells .",
    "it predicted ( as did the haldane hierarchy scheme ) condensed states at all fractions with odd denominators .",
    "however , it was based on the cf picture being applicable at every level of the hierarchy .",
    "the residual interactions between qp s , @xmath16 , have been obtained from numerical studies . for small values of @xmath5 , @xmath17 is known reasonably up to an overall constant ( which has no effect on the nature of the correlations ) .",
    "the nature of the ground state is determined by short range interactions ( i.e. at small values of @xmath5 or small separations between the interacting particles ) . because of this fact numerical results for small systems describe the essential correlations quite well for systems of any size . because @xmath17 is not superharmonic at all values of @xmath5 , laughlin correlations are sometimes forbidden .",
    "this results in the absence of laughlin correlated qp daughter states and of condensed states at certain values of the electron filling factor like @xmath18 and 4/13 .",
    "the observation of condensed states at these and other unexpected filling factors immediately suggests pairing of the cf qp s similar to the pairing of electrons in higher ll s .",
    "this pairing of cf qp s leads to a completely novel set of incompressible states involving new qp s which act like bound states of the cf excitations despite the repulsive interaction between cf s .",
    "the main thing that we hope you take away from these lectures is that despite the truly beautiful work by laughlin and extensions of it by many outstanding scientists ( halperin , haldane , wilczek , schrieffer , kivelson , read , girvin , macdonald , jain , fradkin , morf , chakraborty , das sarma , and many others ) there are always new ways of looking at problems and deeper insights that can lead to interesting new results .",
    "since the quantum hall effect involves electrons moving on a two dimensional ( 2d ) surface in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , we will begin with a brief review of this textbook problem .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the motion of a single electron confined to the @xmath19 plane in the presence of a dc magnetic field @xmath20 is simply @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the vector potential @xmath22 in the _ symmetric _ gauge is given by @xmath23 .",
    "we use @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 as unit vectors along the cartesian axes .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath27 has eigenstates@xcite _ nm ( r , ) = e^im u_nm ( r ) , [ eigenvector ] e_nm = _ c ( 2n + 1 + m + |m| ) . [ eigenvalue ]",
    "the radial function @xmath28 satisfies the differential equation + x^-1 - ( m^2x^-1 + x^2 -)u = 0 [ radialeq ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the radial wavefunctions can be expressed in terms of associated laguerre polynomials as u_nm ( x ) = x^|m| ( -x^2/2)l_n^|m|(x^2 ) .",
    "[ u_nm ] here @xmath31 is independent of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . from eq.([eigenvalue ] ) it is apparent that the spectrum of single particle energies consists of highly degenerate levels with energy @xmath34 taking on the values @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "these levels are called landau levels ; the lowest ll has @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and its wavefunction can be written @xmath40 , where @xmath41 stands for @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for a finite size sample of area @xmath44 ,",
    "the number of single particle states in the lowest ll is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the quantum of flux .",
    "the filling factor @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 is simply equal to the number of flux quanta of the dc magnetic field per electron .",
    "when @xmath47 is equal to an integer , there is an energy gap ( equal to @xmath50 ) between the filled states and the empty states .",
    "this makes the non - interacting electron system incompressible , because an infinitesimal decrease in the area @xmath51 can be accomplished only at the expense of promoting an electron across the energy gap and into the first unoccupied ll .",
    "this incompressibility is responsible for the integral quantum hall effect@xcite . to understand the minima in the diagonal resistivity @xmath52 and the plateaus in the hall resistivity @xmath53",
    ", it is necessary to understand that each ll , broadened by collisions with defects and phonons , must contain both extended states and localized states@xcite .",
    "the extended states lie in the central portion of the broadened ll , and the localized states in the wings . as the chemical potential @xmath54 sweeps through the ll ( by varying either @xmath1 or the particle number @xmath55 ) , zeros of @xmath52 ( at @xmath56 ) and flat plateaus of @xmath53 occur when @xmath54 lies within the localized states .",
    "a many particle wavefunction at filling factor @xmath57 can be constructed by antisymmetrizing the product function which places one electron in each of the @xmath55 states with @xmath58 .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that the many particle wavefunction is , for @xmath59 _ 1 ( 1 , 2 , , n ) = _",
    "< i , j > z_ij  , [ n-1 particle wavefunction ] where the product is over all pairs @xmath60 .",
    "when the filling factor @xmath47 is smaller than unity , the standard approach of placing @xmath55 particles in the lowest energy single particle states is not applicable , because more degenerate states than the number of particles are present in the lowest ll .",
    "laughlin@xcite used remarkable physical insight to propose the wavefunction _",

    "< i , j > z_ij^n  , [ n-1/n particle wavefunction ] for filling factor @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an odd integer .",

    "laughlin also proposed the form of the qp excitations , and evaluated the ground state energy and the gap for creation of a quasielectron(qe)quasihole(qh ) pair .",
    "remarkable confirmation of laughlin s hypothesis was obtained by exact diagonalization@xcite of the interaction hamiltonian within the hilbert subspace of the lowest ll . although real experiments are performed on a 2d plane , it is more convenient to use a spherical 2d surface for numerical diagonalization studies .",

    "the radial magnetic field is @xmath73 .",
    "the single particle states are called monopole harmonics and denoted by @xmath74 , though we will frequently omit the label @xmath75 .",
    "the states @xmath74 are eigenfunctions of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the square of the angular momentum and its @xmath41-component with eigenvalues @xmath78 and @xmath67 respectively , as well as of @xmath79 , the single particle hamiltonian , with energy @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "because this energy must be positive , the allowed values of @xmath3 are given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 0 , 1 , 2 , @xmath37 .",

    "clearly there are @xmath87 ways to choose @xmath55 distinct values of @xmath67 from the @xmath88 allowed values , so there are @xmath89 @xmath55-electron states in the hilbert space of the lowest ll .",
    "the numerical problem is to diagonalize the interaction hamiltonian @xmath90 in this @xmath89 dimensional space .",
    "the problem is facilitated by first determining the eigenfunctions @xmath91 of the total angular momentum .",
    "here , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is an additional label that accounts for distinct multiplets with the same total angular momentum . because @xmath95 is a scalar , the wigner  eckart theorem = _ ll _",
    "mm < l|h_int|l > [ wigner - eckart theorem ] tells us that matrix elements of @xmath95 are independent of @xmath96 and vanish unless @xmath97 .",
    "this reduces the size of the matrix to be diagonalized enormously@xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 state of ten electrons ) @xmath101 and there are 246,448 distinct @xmath10 multiplets with @xmath102 .",

    "the absence of boundary conditions and the complete rotational symmetry make the spherical geometry attractive to theorists .",
    "many experimentalists prefer using the @xmath118 states of the planar geometry .",
    "the chern  simons gauge field is introduced by attaching to each electron a flux tube carrying a flux @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the flux quantum@xcite . this gives rise to a cs magnetic field @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the position of the @xmath123 electron .",
    "@xmath124 has no effect on the classical equations of motion because no two electrons occupy the same position , and a given electron never senses the @xmath125-function magnetic field due to other electrons .",
    "however , in quantum mechanical systems , the vector potential @xmath126 given by a ( r ) = _ 0 d^2 r_1 ^(r_1 ) ( r_1 ) , [ gaugefield ] does introduce a phase factor into the wavefunction@xcite . here",

    "notice that the behavior of qe s is similar for @xmath375 and @xmath450 states , and the same is true for qh s of the 1/3 and 1/5 laughlin states . because @xmath451 , and @xmath452 , we can readily ascertain that @xmath448 is subharmonic at @xmath13 and @xmath289 .",
    "similarly , @xmath449 is subharmonic at @xmath15 and probably at @xmath453 .",
    "there are clearly finite size effects since @xmath17 is different for different values of the electron number @xmath55 .",

    "8 for @xmath448 at @xmath454 1 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "the results are quite accurate up to an overall constant ( which is of no significance when you are interested only in the behavior of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath5 ) . because the short - range interactions ( i.e. at small values of @xmath5 or small qp  qp separations ) determine the nature of the ground state , numerical results for small systems describe the important correlations very well for systems of any size .    from our discussion of correlations in the first excited ll",
    ", it is apparent that laughlin correlations among qe s will not occur at @xmath13 and at @xmath289 , nor will they occur among qh s at @xmath15 .",
    "this immediately tells us that it is impossible for @xmath455 ( and 1/7 ) and @xmath456 to lead to incompressible daughter states of the cf hierarchy .",
    "we emphasize that this statement means that _ for a spin polarized state in which qp s of the laughlin @xmath106 state ( or @xmath450 state ) yield filling factor @xmath455 ( or @xmath456 ) , laughlin correlations among the qp s giving rise to daughter states , at e.g. @xmath457 ( or @xmath458 ) , can not occur ! _",
    "how then can we possibly understand the observations@xcite of incompressible states at both @xmath457 and @xmath458 ?",
    "if laughlin correlations among the qp s are ruled out at certain values of the qp filling , the observation of incompressible states at such values of @xmath0 must be associated with one of two possibilities .",
    "we assumed at the start that the electron system was spin polarized .",
    "it could be that the cf excitations in the partially filled cf shells have their spins reversed with respect to the majority spin cf s filling the fully occupied ll s . then , if the reversed spin cf s had interactions that gave a superharmonic pseudopotential , laughlin correlations among the new reversed spin cf qp s could occur in daughter states .",
    "this was suggested by park and jain@xcite , as a possible explanation of the 4/11 incompressible state , but they did not investigate @xmath459 , the pseudopotential for the interaction of reversed spin qe to prove that it could really occur .",
    "et al._@xcite did investigate the interaction of reversed spin qe s and demonstrated that @xmath459 was weakly superharmonic at @xmath13 , making spin unpolarized states a possible explanation of daughter states that would otherwise be forbidden .",
    "a more interesting possibility is that of pairing@xcite of the cf qp s .",
    "we know from our study of correlations in the first excited ll that pairing of the electrons is expected when @xmath180 , the pseudopotential describing the interaction of a pair of electrons , is not superharmonic .",
    "this is exactly the behavior we found for @xmath16 at certain values of @xmath5 in section 16 .    because @xmath448 has its maximum at @xmath15 ,",
    "the qe s tend to form pairs with @xmath13 in order to minimize the pair amplitude at @xmath15 .",
    "the pairs of _ effectively _ bound fermions would usually be treated as bosons , but in 2d systems boson and fermion statistics can be interchanged via a cs transformation@xcite .",
    "a single pair will have an angular momentum @xmath184 ( the largest possible angular momentum of two fermions each with angular momentum @xmath3 ) , and a relative angular momentum @xmath13 .",
    "however , when more than a single pair is present , the allowed values of the total angular momentum of the pair must be chosen in such a way that the pauli principle is not violated when accounting for identical constituent fermions belonging to different pairs .",
    "this can be accomplished in exactly the same way as was done for electrons in the first excited ll . if the pairs are treated as fermions , the minimum value of the allowed total angular momentum of two pairs is taken to be @xmath460 where 2l_fp = 2(2l-1 ) -_f ( n_p-1 ) .",
    "[ lfp ] here @xmath461 is assumed to equal @xmath462 ( @xmath463 the number of qe s , each with angular momentum @xmath3 ) , and @xmath264 is taken to be 3 .",
    "equation ( [ lfp ] ) is exactly what we obtain by a cs transformation that attaches three flux quanta to each pair .",
    "the _ effective _ ( mean field ) angular momentum of a single fp is @xmath464 .",
    "the relation between @xmath272 and @xmath465 is exactly the same as we found in section 12 , _",
    "fp^-1 = 4_qe^-1 -3 .",
    "[ nufp ] in eq.([nufp ] ) terms of order @xmath274 have been omitted since they vanish in the limit of large systems . the cs transformation given by eq.([lfp",
    "] ) automatically forbids states of two fp s with the smallest separation .",
    "the smallest allowed value of @xmath308 avoids a violation of the pauli principle , and helps the individual qe to avoid the largest qe ",
    "qe repulsion at @xmath15 .",
    "the cs transformation selects from @xmath196 , the number of multiplets of total angular momentum @xmath10 that can be obtained from @xmath55 fermions each with angular momentum @xmath3 , @xmath466 which is a subset@xcite of @xmath467 .",
    "we expect pair formation for qe filling factors satisfying @xmath468 , where laughlin ",
    "jain states that would avoid @xmath13 occur for a superharmonic pseudopotential .",
    "fermion pair states with @xmath277 1/3 , 1/5 , 1/7 , and 1/9 give through eq.([nufp ] ) qe fillings of @xmath469 2/3 , 1/2 , 2/5 , and 1/3 .",
    "only these values of @xmath272 give laughlin states of the fp s with @xmath465 in the required range .",
    "in the hierarchy scheme describing partially filled cf levels , the original electron filling factor is given by @xmath470 .",
    "this is just eq.([cfhierarchy ] ) with @xmath471 , @xmath472 , and @xmath473 . for qh s ,",
    "the pairs have @xmath15 and avoid @xmath289 ; we expect them to occur for @xmath474 satisfying @xmath475 .",
    "this novel scheme of qp pairing leads to a novel family of incompressible states as shown in table ii .",
    "all of these states except the 7/19 and 7/23 states have been observed.@xcite we do nt know if these states are simply difficult to observe ( and might be seen in future experiments ) or if there is some reason why they are not realized in real systems .",
    "we have considered only complete pairing of all the qp s , and this may be an oversimplification that needs to be reconsidered .    as an illustration we have performed an exact diagonalization on a system containing @xmath98 qe s at @xmath476 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath477 and @xmath478 .",

    "the three states in the low energy sector have @xmath104 , 2 , and 4 , and @xmath302 is shown for the @xmath104 state . it should be emphasized that the three low energy states of the superharmonic potential have @xmath258 as a maximum and @xmath228 as a minimum .",
    "this is typical of laughlin correlated states for @xmath481 .",
    "in contrast the subharmonic pseudopotential displays , relative to the superharmonic one , a much larger value of @xmath228 and a much smaller value of @xmath258 .",
    "this is in accord with the formation of pairs with @xmath13 and the avoidance of the maximum qe repulsion at @xmath15 .",

    "it is contrasted with the @xmath104 state of the superharmonic potential at @xmath98 and @xmath483 .",
    "note that the @xmath228 is roughly equal to 1/9 corresponding to only five @xmath13 pairs out of forty five possible pair states .    rather than contradicting the assertion that the 4/11 and 4/13 states can not be incompressible states _ of the spin polarized cf hierarchy _ , the results of pan _",
    "et al._@xcite offer support for the idea of pairing at certain values of @xmath0 where laughlin correlations can not be supported .",
