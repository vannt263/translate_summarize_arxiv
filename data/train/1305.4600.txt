    "the _ positive semidefinite ( psd ) rank _ of a nonnegative matrix was introduced in @xcite and @xcite and is a special case of the _ cone rank _ of a nonnegative matrix from @xcite .",
    "a familiar example of a cone rank is that of _ nonnegative rank _ ; given a nonnegative matrix @xmath8 , its nonnegative rank is the smallest positive integer @xmath7 such that there exists nonnegative vectors @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for each @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the vector space of all real symmetric @xmath14 matrices and @xmath15 denote the cone of all psd matrices in @xmath13 .",
    "then the psd rank of @xmath16 is the smallest integer @xmath7 such that there exists matrices @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we denote it as @xmath19 and call the matrices @xmath20 a _ psd factorization _ of @xmath16 .",
    "nonnegative rank has been studied for several years , has many applications @xcite , and is np - hard to compute @xcite .",
    "there are several techniques for finding lower bounds to nonnegative rank , most of which are based on the zero / nonzero structure ( support ) of the matrix @xcite , and some newer methods that do not rely on support @xcite . for a nonnegative @xmath4 matrix ,",
    "the psd rank is at most the nonnegative rank which in turn is at most @xmath21 .",
    "however , psd rank is more complicated than nonnegative rank with almost no techniques available for finding bounds . in this paper",
    "we exhibit bounds for psd rank in several contexts , and establish new tools for studying this rank .",
    "the motivation for the definition of psd rank came from geometric problems concerning the representation of convex sets for linear optimization .",
    "for instance , given a polytope @xmath22 , one can ask whether @xmath23 can be expressed as the linear image of an affine slice of some positive orthant @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath7 is small relative to the number of facets of @xmath23 , then this implicit representation of @xmath23 can be far more efficient that the natural representation of @xmath23 by inequalities in @xmath0 variables . in the foundational paper @xcite ,",
    "yannakakis proved that the smallest @xmath7 possible for a given @xmath23 is the nonnegative rank of a _ slack matrix _ of @xmath23 ( also called the nonnegative rank of @xmath23 ) . if @xmath23 is a full - dimensional polytope in @xmath25 with vertices @xmath26 and @xmath27 facet - defining inequalities @xmath28 where @xmath29 , then the corresponding slack matrix of @xmath23 is the @xmath30 nonnegative matrix whose @xmath31-entry is @xmath32 , the _ slack _ of vertex @xmath33 in the facet inequality @xmath28 .",
    "yannakakis result was extended in @xcite and @xcite to show that the psd rank of a slack matrix of @xmath23 ( often referred to as the psd rank of @xmath23 ) is exactly the smallest @xmath7 such that @xmath23 is the linear image of an affine slice of the psd cone @xmath15 .",
    "affine slices of the psd cone are called _ spectrahedra _ and can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the linear matrix pencil @xmath36 defined by the matrices @xmath37 . again ,",
    "if @xmath7 is small compared to @xmath27 , one can very often optimize a linear function efficiently over @xmath23 via _ semidefinite programming_. this geometric connection has made psd rank an important invariant of a polytope and both upper and lower bounds on this rank shed information on the complexity of the polytope .",
    "one can further extend yannakakis theorem ( and hence psd rank ) to all convex sets @xcite but in this paper we only consider polytopes .",
    "finding lower bounds on the psd rank of a nonnegative matrix is notoriously hard , even harder than in the case of nonnegative rank , and only somewhat trivial bounds are known .",
    "for example , dimension counting is enough to conclude that the psd rank of a matrix @xmath16 is at least @xmath38 .",
    "support based bounds , the most popular type of bounds for nonnegative rank , are of limited strength in the psd case , but can still yield interesting applications , as shown in @xcite . in the special case of slack matrices of polytopes , we can do slightly better . for example , if @xmath16 is the slack matrix of an @xmath0-dimensional polytope @xmath23 , we actually have @xmath39 , as seen in @xcite , by support based arguments . furthermore , direct application of quantifier elimination bounds guarantees that if @xmath16 has psd rank @xmath7 , then @xmath23 has at most @xmath40 facets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this translates to saying that @xmath41 , where @xmath27 is the number of facets of @xmath23 and @xmath42 the lambert @xmath42-function . using the asymptotic behavior of @xmath42 , this results in a lower bound of the type @xmath43 .    in this paper",
    "we establish several new bounds on psd rank for particular families of matrices with a focus on slack matrices of polytopes . in section  2",
    "we show that a generic @xmath0-dimensional polytope with @xmath1 vertices has psd rank at least @xmath2 , much improving the lower bounds discussed earlier .",
    "an analogous result for nonnegative rank of generic polytopes was proven in @xcite .",
    "this implies that a generic polygon with @xmath1 vertices has psd rank at least @xmath44 while all @xmath1-gons have psd rank at most @xmath1 . in section  3",
    "we improve the upper bound for polygons from @xmath1 to @xmath45 by showing that all hexagons have psd rank four and then using some psd rank calculus from @xcite .",
    "slack matrices of polygons have rank three and we use the previous upper bound on polygons to show that all rank three matrices have psd rank at most @xmath5 . these results are psd analogs of results on nonnegative rank in @xcite , where it is shown that a @xmath1-gon has nonnegative rank at most @xmath46 . next we shift gears in section  4 and examine how low the psd rank of a matrix of fixed rank can get . a nonnegative matrix of rank @xmath6 has psd rank at least @xmath7",
    ". this bound is tight if and only if it is possible to sandwich the psd cone @xmath15 in between two polyhedral cones coming from @xmath16 .",
    "we then reduce this geometric condition to the feasibility of a semialgebraic system and use results on quantifier elimination to show that when @xmath7 is fixed , it is possible to decide in polynomial time whether a nonnegative matrix of rank @xmath6 has psd rank @xmath7 .",
    "in this section we will focus on lower bounds for the psd ranks of generic polytopes .",
    "a polytope @xmath22 is said to be _ generic _ if the coordinates of its vertices form an algebraically independent set over the rationals , i.e. the vertex coordinates do not satisfy any non - trivial polynomial equation with rational coefficients .",
    "it is clear that no simple description of such a polytope can be expected .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the nonnegative rank of a generic polygon with @xmath1 vertices is at least @xmath47 .",
    "their proof in fact extends to showing that the nonnegative rank of a generic @xmath0-dimensional polytope with @xmath1 vertices is at least @xmath48 .",
    "we adapt the philosophy of their proof to the psd case to prove the lower bound , @xmath49 .",

    "the transcendence degree of @xmath60 is at most @xmath61 ( see ( * ? ? ? * chap  6 ) for the definition of transcendence degree and its basic properties ) .",
    "we now show that the vertex coordinates of @xmath23 are all contained in @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a vertex of @xmath23 and @xmath63 a vector such that the linear program ( @xmath64 ) : @xmath65 has @xmath66 as its unique optimal point .",

    "then the semidefinite program ( @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 has the same optimal value as ( @xmath64 ) and the solutions of ( @xmath69 ) are the points in @xmath71 that project to @xmath66 .    if @xmath72 , then @xmath71 could be written as an affine slice of a proper face of @xmath15 . since proper faces of the psd cone",

    "the result in the previous section implies that the psd rank of a generic @xmath1-gon is at least @xmath44 , while on the other hand , @xmath1 is a trivial upper bound on the psd rank of any @xmath1-gon since its slack matrix has size @xmath90 .",
    "this tells us that the worst case rank of a @xmath1-gon lies somewhere between the two . in this section",
    "we will use some simple geometric tools to show that the trivial upper bound can be slightly improved by a constant to @xmath91 .",
    "this result can be stated more generally for matrices of rank three . we will show that if @xmath16 is a nonnegative matrix of rank three of size @xmath4 , then @xmath92 .",
