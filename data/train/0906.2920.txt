    "in our previous paper @xcite , we proved a conjecture of lisca @xcite , establishing a bijective correspondence between the milnor fibers of the smoothing components of a cyclic quotient singularity and the stein fillings of the corresponding contact lens space , the boundary of the singularity .",
    "as a particular case of our results , the milnor fibers corresponding to distinct smoothing components of the reduced miniversal base space of the cyclic quotient singularity are pairwise non - diffeomorphic . here",
    "one has to understand the diffeomorphisms _ in a strong sense _ : namely , there are natural identifications of the boundaries of the milnor fibers up to isotopy , and we showed that there are no diffeomorphisms extending those identifications .    having in mind the construction of de jong and van straten in @xcite regarding the milnor fibers of sandwiched singularites , it is natural to try to extend the above result for such singularities .",
    "one of the main obstructions of this program is that at the present moment the precise description of all the smoothing components of sandwiched singularities ( or / and the classification of all stein fillings of the corresponding contact boundaries ) is out of hope .",
    "nevertheless , we will prove a slightly weaker version of the above result . in order to explain it we need some preparation .",
    "the class of sandwiched singularities received its name in @xcite from the fact that the corresponding singularities are analytically isomorphic to the germs of surfaces which may be `` sandwiched '' birationally between two smooth surfaces ( see also subsection [ sand ] ) .",
    "they form a subclass of the rational surface singularities and their study may be reduced in many respects to the study of plane curve singularities .    indeed , de jong and van straten showed that this was the case for their deformation theory as well .",
    "namely , one may encode a sandwiched singularity @xmath0 by a _ decorated curve _",
    "@xmath1 , which is a germ of reduced plane curve whose components @xmath2 are decorated by sufficiently high positive integers @xmath3 .",
    "one of the main theorems of @xcite states that the deformation properties of a sandwiched singularity reduces to the deformation properties of any such decorated curve which encodes it .",
    "in particular , the 1-parameter smoothings of @xmath0 correspond bijectively to the so - called _ picture deformations _ of @xmath1 , which are @xmath4-constant deformations of @xmath5 with generic fibers having only ordinary singularities , accompanied with flat deformations of @xmath6 ( seen as a subscheme of the normalization of @xmath5 ) which generically are reduced and contain the preimage of the singular locus of the generic fiber .",
    "the milnor fiber corresponding to a smoothing component of @xmath0 may be reconstructed up to strong diffeomorphism from the embedding in a 4-ball of the generic fiber of a corresponding picture deformation .",
    "part of the topological structure of the generic fiber of the deformation of @xmath1 may be encoded in an associated _ incidence matrix _ between the irreducible components of the deformation of @xmath5 and the images of the support of @xmath6 seen as a subscheme of the normalization .",
    "this matrix is well - defined up to permutation of columns .",
    "as it is proved in @xcite , the validity of lisca s conjecture implies that , _ for cyclic quotient singularities _ , the milnor fibers which correspond to distinct incidence matrices ( up to permutation of columns ) are not strongly diffeomorphic .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that _ the same is true for all sandwiched surface singularities _ ( see theorem [ distinc ] ) .    in fact , for any fixed realization of @xmath0 by a decorated curve @xmath1 , we provide a canonical method to reproduce all the incidence matrices ( associated with @xmath1 ) from the milnor fibers .",
    "hence , each realization @xmath1 provides a ` test ' to separate the milnor fibers ( in fact , precise criteria to recognize them ) .",
    "recall also that de jong and van straten predict ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 4.3 ) ) ) that , for any fixed @xmath1 , the set of smoothing components of the deformation space of @xmath0 injects into the set of incidence matrices associated with @xmath1 . in particular , for any class of singularities , when this is indeed the case , we obtain via our result that there is no pair of smoothing components with ( strongly ) diffeomorphic milnor fibers .    in order to connect our main result with the set of stein fillings of the contact boundary",
    ", we have to face a new aspect of the problem : sandwiched singularities are not necessarily taut ( that is , their analytical structure is not determined by their topology ) .",
    "moreover , fixing a topological type , for different analytic types one might have different structure of the miniversal deformation space ( therefore different sets of milnor fibers ) .",
    "nevertheless , for a fixed topological type , the induced natural contact structure on the boundary is independent of the analytic realization and is invariant up to isotopy by all orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    therefore ,",
    "in theorem [ lowbound ] we are able to extend the above recognition criterion of the milnor fibers via incidence matrices by considering all the smoothings associated with the deformations of all the decorated germs of plane curves with a fixed topology . in this way",
    "we get a lower bound for the number of stein fillings of the contact boundary of a sandwiched surface singularity , considered up to orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms fixed on the boundary .",
    "all the differentiable manifolds we consider are oriented : any letter , say @xmath7 , denoting a manifold denotes in fact an oriented manifold .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the manifold obtained by changing the orientation of @xmath7 , and by @xmath9 its boundary , canonically oriented by the rule that the outward normal _ followed _ by the orientation of @xmath9 gives the orientation of @xmath7 .",
