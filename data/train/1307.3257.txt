    "m - dwarfs of spectral class m7 and hotter have been discovered to emit quiescent x - rays , and lower mass brown dwarfs emit x - rays intermittently @xcite . currently , there is no satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon , but there are some promising models that may account for the observed x - ray emissions .",
    "for example , @xcite propose that charge build - up on grains may lead to atmospheric ionization to a degree sufficient to couple the magnetic field to a partially ionized atmospheric gas .",
    "the magnetic fields would follow the convective atmospheric dynamics , and would become tangled .",
    "x - rays would then be the consequence of magnetic reconnection events . this scenario requires a charge density at least @xmath0 times greater than predicted by thermal ionization in current model atmospheres ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "2 ) . other ionizing mechanisms need therefore to be considered . in this paper",
    ", we provide a first study of how significant cosmic ray ionization is in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and giant gas planets .",
    "if cosmic rays contribute significantly to atmospheric ionization in extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs , the effects of this ionization may provide an opportunity to better constrain the energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in a variety of planetary atmospheres .",
    "a large number of cosmic rays are blocked from earth by the solar wind @xcite , although the voyager probe is expected to measures the interstellar cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "free - floating planets and stellar objects would not be so protected , and the observable effects of cosmic ray ionization in the atmospheres of these objects may provide us an indirect way to determine the spectrum of extrasolar cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays were first discovered because of their ionizing effect on the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray ionization may affect terrestrial climate conditions by enhancing aerosol formation @xcite and initiating discharge events @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigate the possible impact of cosmic ray showers on biological organisms in extrasolar earth - like planets with weak magnetic fields by considering the effect of a weaker planetary magnetic field on cosmic ray propagation through the planetary atmosphere .",
    "the effect of the earth s electric field on cosmic ray propagation is also being explored .",
    "for example , @xcite found measurable enhancement in cosmic ray intensity when a negative electric field of magnitude @xmath11 kv / m is present in the atmosphere . @xcite",
    "provide a comprehensive review of the research into connections between cosmic rays and the atmosphere .",
    "the effect of cosmic rays on the exospheres of free - floating extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs that form dust clouds in the low atmosphere has not been explored so far .",
    "the impact of cosmic rays on the exosphere is of particular interest as it links the underlaying atmosphere with the object s magnetosphere and may also help to understand coronal effects in the substellar mass regime .",
    "the cosmic ray opacity of brown dwarf and hot jupiter atmospheres has been explored by @xcite , where the cosmic ray flux is considered to decrease exponentially with the column density of the gas @xcite .",
    "the effect of cosmic ray propagation on the rate of ionization of the gas has been modeled in some detail for diffuse conditions in the interstellar medium @xcite , dense environments @xcite and the terrestrial atmosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both employ monte carlo models for cosmic ray propagation . @xcite",
    "consider pair - production and particle decay ( full monte - carlo simulation of an atmospheric cascade ) , and @xcite consider the energy loss due to ionizing collisions and the effect of a weak magnetic field ( @xmath12 mg ) on the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "the models of @xcite have been tested against various atmospheric profiles and model assumptions @xcite . @xcite",
    "numerically solve the propagation integral from + @xcite , and account for energy lost due to ionization and excitation .",
    "@xcite solve a set of boltzmann transport equations for the cosmic rays , with a term for energy loss due to pair - production of electrons .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the impact of cosmic ray ionization on the electron fraction in model atmospheres of an example brown dwarf and two example giant gas planets . to this end , we utilise model atmospheres which do not necessarily resample any known free - floating planets . in order to separate the effect of cosmic rays from external uv photons , we only consider _ free - floating _ objects not in proximity to a strong uv field .",
    "we utilize 1d monte carlo and analytic cosmic ray propagation methods over a wide range of densities to allow a principle investigation of the effect of cosmic rays .    in order to explore cosmic ray ionization in the atmosphere , propagation of the cosmic rays through both the exosphere and atmosphere",
    "must be treated .",
    "a simple density profile for the gas in the exosphere is calculated in section [ sec : exosphere ] , using the boltzmann transport equation and assuming a maxwellian distribution for the gas .",
    "this is necessary because the exosphere is very likely no longer a collisionally dominated gas , hence the continuum assumption for applying hydrodynamic concepts breaks down ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we are using drift - phoenix model atmosphere structures which are the result of the solution of the coupled equations of radiative transfer , convective energy transport ( modelled by mixing length theory ) , chemical equilibrium ( modelled by laws of mass action ) , hydrostatic equilibrium , and dust cloud formation ( dehn 2007 , helling et al .",
    "2007a , b ; witte , helling & hauschildt 2009 , @xcite ) .",
    "the dust cloud formation model includes a model for seed formation ( nucleation ) , surface growth and evaporation of mixed materials , and gravitational settling ( drift ) ( woitke & helling 2003 , 2004 ; helling & woitke 2006 ; and helling , woitke & thi 2008 ) .",
    "the results of the drift - phoenix model atmosphere simulations include the gas temperature - gas pressure structure ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , the local gas - phase composition in thermochemical equilibrium , the local electron number densities ( @xmath15 ) , and the number of dust grains ( @xmath16 ) and their sizes ( @xmath17 ) dependent on the height in the atmosphere .",
    "these models are determined by the effective temperature , @xmath18 , the surface gravity , log(g ) , and the initial elemental abundances .",
    "the elemental abundances are set to the solar values throughout this paper .",
    "we consider a model atmosphere of a brown dwarf , with a surface gravity of @xmath19 and an effective temperature of @xmath4 k , as well as model atmospheres for two example giant gas planets , both with @xmath20 .",
    "the effective temperatures of free - floating exoplanets are not constrained , allowing us to freely explore this part of the parameter space .",
    "we chose the values of @xmath4 k to allow for direct comparison with earlier work @xcite , and @xmath5 k , which is the inferred effective temperature of , a giant gas planet @xmath21 au from its host star @xcite .",
    "the distance of @xmath22 au is far enough to possibly allow the planet s parameters to be effectively the same as those of a free - floating giant gas planet .",
    "section [ sec : crt ] describes our cosmic ray transport calculations for cosmic rays of energy @xmath0 ev @xmath23 ev .",
    "we then calculate the steady - state degree of ionization by cosmic rays .",
    "we combine the cosmic ray ionization to the thermal degree of ionization from drift - phoenix .",
    "section [ sec : results ] contains the resulting degree of ionization and includes the effect on the coupling of the magnetic field of the gas .",
    "for modelling purposes , we divide the gas around the planet or brown dwarf into three regions ( inward @xmath24 outward ) : the cloud layer indicates the location and extent of the cloud layer . ] ( lowest ) , the dust - free upper atmosphere ( middle ) and the exosphere ( highest ) . the location and extent of the cloud layer",
    "is determined by the dust formation and atmosphere model drift - phoenix @xcite .",
    "the exosphere is considered here to be the regime where the gas can no longer be accurately modeled as a fluid .",
    "this occurs when the mean free path of the gas particles is of the order of the atmospheric scale height .",
    "the pressure at which this is the case is the lowest pressure considered in the drift - phoenix model atmospheres , and we place the exobase at that height .",
    "figure [ fig : profile ] provides gas density and cloud particle number density profiles of the three example model atmospheres and exospheres considered here , as well as the mean grain sizes of cloud particles for the model atmosphere of two example giant gas planets ( @xmath20 , @xmath5 k , @xmath6 k ) and a brown dwarf ( @xmath19 , @xmath4 k ) .",
    "this grain size profile demonstrates the location of the cloud with respect to the atmospheric temperature and gas density .",
    "figure [ fig : pt ] shows the @xmath25 profiles for the model atmospheres .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     ) for @xmath20 , @xmath5 k. the solid line denotes both the hecr and lecr contribution , while the dashed line denotes the hecr contribution only .",
    "the dotted line represents the electron abundance in the absence of cosmic rays , hence thermal ionization only .",
    "the solid red line is the dust number density , @xmath26 [ @xmath27 , and indicates where the cloud layer is located . ]",
    "this paper seeks to answer the question of the significance of cosmic ray ionization on the number of free electrons in brown dwarfs and giant gas planets .",
    "we further examine the possible coupling of the magnetic field to the gas because of the increased degree of ionization .",
    "we develop an analytical model for the exospheric density profile which we combine to an atmospheric structure .",
    "the drift - phoenix model atmospheres provide the inner boundary conditions for the exosphere model , and they provide the density profile that we utilize below the exobase . cosmic ray transport through the exosphere and the atmosphere",
    "is then calculated using these density profiles .",
    "a monte carlo cosmic ray transport method from @xcite is applied to cosmic rays of @xmath28 ev .",
    "an analytic method for cosmic ray transport from @xcite is applied to cosmic rays of @xmath29 ev .",
    "we calculate an ionization rate for which we provide a parameterized expression ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : e - production ] ) .",
    "we use this expression to estimate the steady state degree of ionization ( eq . [ eqn : degree - of - ionizaiton ] ) .",
    "do cosmic rays have a significant impact on the electron fraction ?",
    "if the measure of significance is the number of free electrons in the upper atmosphere , then the answer is `` yes '' .",
    "cosmic ray ionization is responsible for almost all the free electrons in our upper model atmospheres and for the giant gas planet model atmospheres , achieves a degree of ionization approaching that necessary to qualify the highest regions of these model atmospheres as weakly interacting plasmas , thereby providing an environment for plasma processes @xcite . if , however , the measure of significance is the degree of coupling of the magnetic field to the gas , then the answer is `` no '' .",
    "the model predicts a cosmic ray enhancement to the steady - state electron abundance by several orders of magnitude for atmospheric regions with @xmath30 bar for brown dwarf conditions and for @xmath7,@xmath31 bar for giant gas planet conditions , with @xmath4 k in both cases .",
    "this enhancement is not large enough to allow the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath32 above the cloud top , and does not significantly affect @xmath33 for the bulk of the cloud layer .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic field would not couple to the gas because of the steady - state cosmic ray ionization enhancement .",
    "however , the geometry of the magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might lead to a channeling of the cosmic rays which then would amplify the local degree of ionization beyond the values determined in this paper , which would cause heterogeneous distribution of cosmic ray induced chemical products .",
    "the increased abundance of electrons may contribute to charge build - up on dust at the top of the cloud layer .",
    "this is especially the case for our model brown dwarf atmosphere , because cosmic rays penetrate more deeply into its cloud layer .",
    "cosmic rays were first discovered by their ionization effects in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we predict that ionization effects have a significant impact on the upper atmospheres of free - floating extrasolar planets and very low - mass stars .",
    "the effect the cosmic ray induced degree of ionization has on the chemistry in the upper atmospheres of these objects is a very interesting question .",
    "it has been suggested that cosmic rays may drive production of small hydrocarbons that may be responsible for the hazes of e.g. hd 189733 b @xcite .",
    "this is a question we hope to explore in detail in a future paper .",
    "we highlight financial support of the european community under the fp7 by an erc starting grant .",
    "we are grateful to kristina kislyakova and helmut lammer for helpful discussions relating to our exosphere model ."
