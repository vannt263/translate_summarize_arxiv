    "@xmath0be and @xmath1c are examples of one - neutron halo nuclei , where the loosely bound valence neutron has a large spatial extension with respect to the respective cores ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "breakup reactions , in which the valence neutron is removed from the projectile in its interaction with a target nucleus , have played a very useful role in probing the structure of such nuclei @xcite .",
    "strongly forward peaked angular distributions for the neutron @xcite and the narrow widths of the parallel momentum distributions @xcite of the core fragments are some of the characteristic features of the breakup reactions induced by these nuclei , which provide a clean confirmation of their halo structure . in the serber types of models",
    "@xcite , the breakup cross section is directly related to the momentum space wave function of the projectile ground state .",
    "the coulomb breakup is a significant reaction channel in the scattering of halo nuclei from a heavy target nucleus ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it provides a convenient way to put constraints on the electric dipole response of these nuclei @xcite .",
    "the coulomb breakup of weakly bound nuclei can also be used in determining the cross sections of the astrophysically interesting radiative capture reactions @xcite .",
    "the breakup of the halo nuclei have been investigated theoretically by several authors using a number of different approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an extensive list of references ) .",
    "some of these models @xcite use semiclassical geometrical concepts ( mostly serber type ) to calculate the breakup cross sections .",
    "a direct breakup model ( dbm ) ( which reduces to the serber model in a particular limit @xcite ) has been formulated within the framework of the post form distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite .",
    "however so far only the coulomb breakup of the halo nuclei has been investigated within this theory .",
    "the nuclear breakup , for these cases , has been studied mostly within the semiclassical @xcite and eikonal models @xcite .",
    "breakup reactions of halo nuclei can also be described as the inelastic excitation of the projectile from its ground state to the continuum @xcite . in an extensively used theoretical approach ,",
    "the corresponding t - matrix is written in terms of the prior form dwba @xcite .",
    "for the pure coulomb breakup , the semiclassical approximation of this theory is the first order perturbative alder - winther theory of coulomb excitation @xcite .",
    "it has recently been used to analyze the data on the breakup reactions induced by @xmath0be @xcite and @xmath1c @xcite .",
    "however , higher order excitation effects @xcite may be substantial in the breakup of these nuclei .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for the coulomb breakup of @xmath1c , the results of the first order semiclassical coulomb excitation theory differ strongly from those of the dbm which includes the higher order effects .",
    "the general methods in the semiclassical description of the excitation process which include higher order effects , are the coupled channel approaches @xcite , explicit inclusion of successive higher order terms @xcite , and the direct numerical integration of the time dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the last method , in which all the higher order effects in the relative motion of the breakup fragments are included , provides a fully dynamical calculation of the projectile excitation caused by both the coulomb and the nuclear interactions between the projectile and the target .    the time dependent schrdinger equation method has been used earlier @xcite to investigate the coulomb breakup of @xmath0li and @xmath0be .",
    "however , these calculations have employed a straight line trajectory for the projectile motion ( an approximation valid at higher beam energies ) and have ignored the spins of the particles in the nuclear models . furthermore , they are partly perturbative in the sense that the first order perturbation theory has been used therein to calculate the energy distribution of the breakup cross section at larger impact parameters",
    ". this procedure may lead @xcite to a significantly larger cross section as compared to that obtained in models where the partly perturbative approximation is not used .    in this paper , we present calculations for both the coulomb and the nuclear breakup of the one - neutron halo nuclei @xmath0be and @xmath1c within the time dependent schrdinger equation method ( this will be referred as the dynamical calculation in the rest of this paper ) .",
    "the spins of the particles are included explicitly in the nuclear model .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the internal motion of the projectile contains a spin dependent interaction .",
    "no perturbative approximation has been made in the calculation of the breakup cross sections .",
    "we also calculate first order perturbative results as a limit of our dynamical model so that a consistent investigation of the role of the dynamical effect in the breakup cross sections is possible .",

    "the nuclear breakup occurs when the projectile and the target nuclei are close to each other .",
    "its magnitude which is determined mostly by the geometrical conditions , has a weak dependence on the relative energy of the outgoing fragments beyond a certain minimum value .",

    "the results shown in this figure are in agreement with those of ref .",
    "the domination of the nuclear breakup may explain the failure of the pure coulomb finite range dwba calculations @xcite in explaining the data at larger relative energies .",
    "the coherent sum of the coulomb and the nuclear contributions provides a good overall description of the experimental data .",
    "although , the pure nuclear breakup contributions below 0.5  mev are substantial , yet their interference with the coulomb part does not change appreciably the shape of the total cross section in the peak region . it may be noted that the absolute magnitude of the cross section near the maximum is somewhat underestimated by our calculations , but the position of the peak is well reproduced .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of the dynamical calculations reported in @xcite .",
    "however , in the semiclassical coupled - channel calculations @xcite for this reaction , the peak position of the calculated cross sections are shifted towards larger energies as compared to that of the data .",
    "it may be remarked that use of a some what smaller minimum impact parameter in the angular integration over the @xmath0be c.m . would increase the cross sections which may reduce the difference between the experiment and the theory .",
    "however , this would mainly affect the nuclear contribution since it is more sensitive to the smaller projectile - target distances .",
    "the coulomb contributions arise mostly from the much larger impact parameters as long as the excitation energy is not too large . at very small impact parameters",
    "the absorption due to the imaginary parts of the optical potentials will result in an effective cutoff . since the optical potentials are not sufficiently well known , the choice of the maximum scattering angle introduces an uncertainty but our choice for this is a reasonable one .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the results of our dynamical calculations for the relative energy spectrum of the fragments ( neutron and @xmath98c ) emitted in the breakup of @xmath1c on a @xmath100pb target at the beam energy of 67 mev / nucleon .",
    "the integrations over @xmath101 were done in the range of @xmath102 .",
    "since the binding energy ( b@xmath103 ) of the valence neutron - core system in the ground state of @xmath1c is still an unsettled issue @xcite , we present in this figure the results of calculations performed with two values [ 530 kev ( part a ) and 650 kev ( part b ) ] of b@xmath103 .",
    "this is for the first time that the dynamical calculations ( including the nuclear breakup ) have been performed for this case .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite .",
    "we see that the coulomb breakup dominates the cross sections in the peak region while the nuclear breakup is important at the larger relative energies in this case too .",
    "the dynamical calculations carried out with the binding energy of 530 kev [ part ( a ) ] overestimate the cross sections in the peak region by about 35 - 40@xmath2 , while those done with 650 kev [ part ( b ) ] are in good agreement with the data .",
    "our calculations , therefore , seem to support the latter value for b@xmath103 which is within the error range of the value @xmath104  kev ] reported in @xcite .",
    "the expected shift in the peak position in part ( b ) is within statistical error of the data .",
    "we would like to recall , however , that we have used a spectroscopic factor of 1 for the neutron - core configuration for the ground state of @xmath1c .",
    "an alternative scenario has been presented in @xcite , where the same data have been analyzed within the first order semiclassical perturbation theory of the coulomb excitation . with a binding energy of 530 kev and the same neutron - core configuration for the ground state of @xmath1c",
    ", these calculations overestimate the data in the peak region by about 40 - 50@xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "instead of using a larger value of b@xmath103 in order to fit the data , these authors try to extract a spectroscopic factor ( sf ) for this configuration by comparing their pure coulomb dissociation calculations with the data ( which are corrected for the nuclear breakup effects in an approximate way ) .",
    "the value of sf ( 0.67 ) obtained in this way is close to the shell model results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , a note of caution must be added about the significance to this result .",
    "the spectroscopic factors reported in @xcite correspond to various specific states of the @xmath98c core .",
    "the data of ref .",
    "@xcite are , however , inclusive in the sense that the specific core states of @xmath98c are not observed there .",
    "therefore , measurements of the relative energy spectra in experiments of the type reported in @xcite , where specific core states of @xmath98c are identified by tagging to the decay photons , are required for a meaningful comparison of the sf extracted from such studies with those of the shell model .",
    "moreover , the procedure adopted in @xcite to correct the data for the nuclear breakup effects may not be valid due to the long range of the nuclear interaction in case of the halo nuclei @xcite . obviously , the value of the sf extracted from the breakup studies depends critically on the theory used to calculate the corresponding cross sections .",
    "therefore , more experimental data and their theoretical analysis within different models of the breakup reactions are required for arriving at a more definite conclusion in this regard .",
    "another argument put forward in @xcite in favor of their procedure is that with the values 0.530 mev and 0.67 for b@xmath103 and sf , respectively , the angular distribution of the @xmath6 + @xmath98c c.m .  measured in the same reaction is well reproduced .",
    "however , this conclusion assumes that the shape of this angular distribution is not affected by the nuclear breakup effects below the grazing angle ( @xmath105 2.7@xmath106 ) . to study the role of the nuclear breakup for this data , we show in fig .",
    "3 the angular distribution of the c.m .  of the @xmath6 + @xmath98c system for the values of b@xmath103 of 530 kev ( upper part ) and 650 kev ( lower part ) .",
    "the integrations over the relative energy is performed in the range of 0.00.5 mev ( the same as done in ref .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the nuclear breakup effects start becoming important already from c.m .",
    "angles of 1.5@xmath106 , and the total cross section ( coherent sum of the coulomb and nuclear contributions ) differs from the pure coulomb one even below the grazing angle . beyond this angle , the absorptive part of the optical potentials reduces the cross section . in this figure",
    "we have not shown the comparison of our calculations with the experimental data as it would require folding the calculations with the experimental angular resolution @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison of the unfolded and folded results as shown in @xcite suggests that the quality of agreement between calculations done with both the options and the data would be similar .",
    "the magnitude of higher order effects in the coulomb breakup reactions of @xmath0be and @xmath1c is a subject of current interest . in an earlier calculation @xcite ,",
    "higher order effects were found to be rather small for the reaction studied in fig .  1 .",
    "however , comparing the result of the adiabatic model of coulomb breakup reactions with that of the first order semiclassical perturbation theory of the coulomb excitation , it has been concluded in @xcite that the higher order effects are substantial for the reaction investigated in fig .  2 , which    would have a considerable influence on the extracted spectroscopic factor .",
    "in contrast , these effects were found to be rather small in @xcite where the first order and the higher order terms were calculated within the same model .",
    "as discussed in section ii , the first order perturbation theory results can be obtained from our dynamical model in a particular limit . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the first order results obtained in this way are compared with those of the full dynamical model for the pure coulomb breakup contribution to the same reaction as in fig .",
    "it can be noted that the higher order effects are rather small .",
    "they reduce the peak cross sections of the first order theory by about 10@xmath2 for both values of b@xmath103 but leave the shapes of the spectra largely unaffected .    in fig .  5",
    ", we compare the pure coulomb breakup contributions ( calculated within the dynamical model and the finite range dwba @xcite ) to the reactions studied in figs .  1 and 2 . in the finite range dwba theory",
    "the higher order effects in the target - fragment interaction are automatically incorporated .",
    "the interesting aspect of this comparison is that while for the @xmath0be case the finite range dwba results are slightly larger than those of the dynamical semiclassical calculation , the former is smaller than the latter for @xmath1c induced reaction for both the values of the binding energy .",
    "this clearly shows that higher order calculations for the coulomb breakup performed within different theories could be different from each other .",
    "the reason for this difference is the fact that fully quantal higher order approaches    take into account effects which are beyond the semiclassical dynamical model calculations .",
    "therefore , the results of the semiclassical first order perturbation theory will differ from those of different higher order models in different ways .",
    "thus , the conclusion about the role of the higher order effects will differ if the first order and higher order calculations performed within two different theories are compared with each other .",
    "it may also be remarked here that the spectroscopic factors extracted from the comparison of the coulomb breakup calculations of different models with the corresponding data could be quite different from each other , as has already been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the coulomb and the nuclear breakup of the one - neutron halo nuclei , @xmath0be and @xmath1c , on a @xmath100pb target within a semiclassical fully dynamical model of the projectile excitation process .",
    "the time evolution of the projectile system is described by numerically solving the time dependent schrdinger equation in three dimensions . through this nonperturbative method",
    "higher order effects are fully taken into account in the breakup process .",
    "unlike previous such calculations , we assume the projectile to move along a hyperbolic trajectory instead of a straight - line one .",
    "a simple single particle potential model was used to calculate the ground state wave function of the projectile nuclei .    with a configuration for the @xmath0be ground state in which a 2@xmath93 neutron is coupled to the ground state of the @xmath95be core with a binding energy of 0.504 mev and a spectroscopic factor of unity , the experimental relative energy distributions of the fragments ( neutron and @xmath95be ) emitted in the breakup reaction of @xmath0be on a lead target at the beam energy of 72 mev / nucleon",
    "are described rather well by our model .",
    "the coulomb breakup dominates these cross sections around the peak region while the nuclear breakup is important at higher relative energies .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the failure of the pure coulomb breakup calculations in describing these data at the larger relative energies .    for the @xmath1c case",
    ", the comparison of the dynamical calculations with the data for the relative energy spectrum of the fragments suggests that the ground state configuration of this nucleus is consistent with a 2@xmath93 neutron coupled to the ground state of the @xmath98c core with a binding energy of 0.650 mev and a spectroscopic factor of 1 .",
    "alternatively , it could also have a binding energy of 0.530 mev but a spectroscopic factor of about @xmath107 .",
    "the current data @xcite on the relative energy spectrum are not sufficient to rule out either of these possibilities .",
    "further experimental studies in which the relative energy spectrum is measured by tagging the specific core states and calculations of the coulomb and nuclear breakup effects within different models ( e.g. , finite range dwba ) are clearly needed to settle this issue .    by comparing the dynamical model results for the pure coulomb breakup with the first order calculations ( which are deduced from the same model in a particular limit )",
    ", we find that higher order effects in these reactions are generally small .",
    "they reduce the magnitudes of the first order relative energy distribution of the fragments by about 10 - 15@xmath2 in the peak region .",
    "their shapes , however , remain almost unaltered by the higher order effects .",
    "however , a comparison of the higher order and first order calculations of two different models may lead to large differences in the two results .",
    "this is due to the fact that higher order calculations performed within different theories include these effects in different approximations and could differ quite a bit from each other .",

    "<S> we investigate the breakup of the one - neutron halo nuclei @xmath0be and @xmath1c within a dynamical model of the continuum excitation of the projectile . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the projectile in coordinate space is described by solving the three - dimensional time dependent schrdinger equation , treating the projectile - target ( both coulomb and nuclear ) interaction as a time dependent external perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the pure coulomb breakup dominates the relative energy spectra of the fragments in the peak region , while the nuclear breakup is important at higher relative energies . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent sum of the two contributions provides a good overall description of the experimental spectra . </S>",
    "<S> cross sections of the first order perturbation theory are derived as a limit of our dynamical model . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical effects are found to be of the order of 10 - 15@xmath2 for the beam energies in the range of 60 - 80 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of our results with those of a post form distorted wave born approximation shows that the magnitudes of the higher order effects are dependent on the theoretical model . </S>"
