    "the study of the galaxy population at high redshifts has progressed rapidly during the last decade . through the lyman - break technique hundreds of normal ( i.e. not dominated by active galactic nuclei ) , star forming galaxies at z=24 have been detected and studied with imaging as well as spectroscopy ( steidel et al .",
    "these so called lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) have star formation rates ( sfrs ) in the range 455h@xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 for @xmath5=1.0 or 20  270 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 for @xmath5=0.2 ( pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) . also , via the study of the class of high column density qso absorption lines systems known as damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) a wealth of information on the early chemical evolution of galaxies at z=24 has been obtained ( e.g. lu et al .",
    "the dlas are in general forming stars at a significantly lower rate than the lbgs ( mller & warren 1998 , fynbo et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "independent information about the formation of the brightest galaxies comes from detailed studies of the stellar populations of present day bright cluster ellipticals .",
    "these populations seems to have formed early ( z@xmath62 ) in strong burst of star formation ( bower et al .",
    "studies of the fundamental plane for elliptical and lenticular galaxies in rich clusters at intermediate redshifts also indicate early formation times ( z@xmath65 for @xmath5=1 , jrgensen et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the fundamental plane for field ellipticals at similar redshifts is consistent with being the same as in clusters ( treu et al .",
    "studies of the globular cluster populations of faint elliptical galaxies also indicate rather early formation times ( z@xmath61 ) , whereas for bright cluster ellipticals the globular cluster populations do not strongly constrain the possible formation scenarios ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "1998 ) . furthermore",
    ", the presence of seemingly old stellar populations in elliptical galaxies at z@xmath61 proves that at least some elliptical galaxies formed very early in strong bursts of star formation ( spinrad et al .",
    "1997 , treu et al .",
    "1999b , see also jimenez et al .",
    "1999 ) . for first - rank ellipticals star formation rates as high as sfr@xmath710@xmath8 m@xmath3",
    "yr@xmath4 would then be possible .",
    "a reason why such high star formation rates have not been detected in galaxies at high redshift may be that these galaxies are the hosts of powerful qsos and hence are hidden by the light from the qsos ( e.g. terlevich & boyle 1993 ) .",
    "support for a connection between qsos and bright elliptical galaxies comes from the fact that radio quiet qsos as well as radio loud qsos and radio galaxies at z=0.1 - 0.3 are hosted by galaxies for which the light profiles are best fit by de vaucouleurs profiles indicating that they are early stages of massive ellipticals ( mclure et al .",
    "there is increasing evidence that qsos at redshifts z@xmath92 are embedded in extended emission that is consistent with the presence of a stellar population in the qso host galaxies . in the case of radio",
    "loud qsos host galaxies have been detected in the optical and infrared by lehnert et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and carballo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and in the case of radio quiet qsos host galaxies have been detected in the optical and near infrared by aretxaga et al .",
    "( 1998a , b ) .",
    "there does not seem to be any systematic differences between the host galaxies of radio loud and radio quiet qsos .",
    "both populations of host galaxies are extremely bright , r@xmath92122 , and have optical - to - infrared colours in the range r - k@xmath935 .",
    "however , measured polarisation of the light from some radio galaxies show that scattered qso light can also contribute significantly to the observed extended emission ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in 1996",
    "we performed a narrow band study of the z@xmath10z@xmath11 damped ly@xmath0 absorber ( dla , wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) towards q0151 + 048a using the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) ( fynbo et al .",
    "the main result of this study was the detection of extended ly@xmath0 emission from the dla .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission line had prior to this been detected in a spectroscopic study of q0151 + 048a ( mller et al .",
    "1998 ) , but the large extended nature of the dla absorber was quite unexpected .",
    "u band data , also from the 1996 run , hinted at the existence of an extended broad band object , but the signal  to  noise ratio of the object was low . we have therefore obtained deeper imaging of q0151 + 048 in broad band u , b and i filters in order to confirm or reject our tentative detection , and to measure the extend and luminosity of the broad band source if real .    in sect .",
    "2 below we describe our new observations . in sect .",
    "3 we describe in detail the two independent methods we have used to search for extended objects close to the quasar .",
    "first we describe the image - deconvolution , where we used the magain et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter mcs ) algorithm , secondly we describe the direct psf subtraction , and sect .",
    "4 we discuss our results .    in this paper we adopt h=100 h km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath12=1.0 and @xmath13=0 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the observations were performed during two observing runs in september and october 1998 with hirac ( high resolution adaptive camera ) on the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope .",
    "the ccd used was a 2048@xmath14 back - side illuminated thinned loral with a pixel size of 0.1082 arcsec .",
    ".observations of q0151 + 048 , sept 17  20 and oct 17  18 , 1998 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ instan ]    the colours of the host , 0@xmath15u - b@xmath151.1 , -1.1@xmath15b - i@xmath150.1 from deconvolution and 0.9@xmath160.3 , -0.7@xmath160.3 from psf - subtraction , are roughly consistent with instantaneous bursts with ages in the range 10100 myr .",
    "the number of stars formed in the burst would be in the range from 10@xmath17 to a few times 10@xmath18 stars depending on the age of the burst and on the assumed cosmology .",
    "another interpretation of the extended fuzz frequently seen around quasars , is light from the quasar itself scattered by dust .",
    "this mechanism is well known from radio galaxies at high redshifts where scattering off dust grains has revealed the existence of `` hidden '' quasars in the galaxy cores . it is likely that radio quiet qsos have similar non ",
    "isotropic radiation fields ( see e.g. the discussion in mller & kjrgaard 1992 ) , and in that case our line of sight is such that we look straight down the emission cone inside of which the scattering is taking place . in this case we therefore expect to see the quasar emission cone `` end on '' via forward scattered quasar light .",
    "the scattering process is expected to be essentially grey and recent calculations predict that as much as 10% of the quasar light could be scattered in this way ( witt & gordon , 1999 ; vrosi & dwek , 1999 ; vernet et al . in prep . ) .",
    "if considering a clumpy medium , we would expect dust scattered light to be emitted from inside a very large volume in front of the quasar .",
    "when taking the cone geometry into account one would expect its total flux to be roughly a few % of the quasar flux at any given wavelength ( fosbury , private communication ) . from table 3",
    "we find that the flux from hga is 3 , 6 and 2% of the flux from q0151 + 048a in u , b and i respectively .",
    "similar , but less significant , results are found for hgb .",
    "it is not yet known if the light profile of scattered light from a cone will reproduce a de vaucouleurs profile , but since this seems to be a universally preferred profile it is not unlikely .",
    "one thing worth noting in fig .",
    "[ psfsub]e are the negative residuals surrounding the position of qa at a distance of 2 - 3 arcsec after subtraction of the fitted de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "this indicates that the true profile of hga in reality falls off steeper than a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "if model calculations were to show such a steep profile for forward scattered light in a radiation cone , that would be a strong hint towards the nature of the quasar fuzz .    however , the colours of the extended emission as seen in table 3 and fig .",
    "[ colours ] are significantly different from those of the two qsos , which argues against the scattering hypothesis .",
    "hence , we conclude that at least a significant fraction of the observed extended emission must be caused by a star burst .",
    "we wish to thank pierre magain and peter stetson for making available the mcs - code and daohpot - ii respectively .",
    "we have benefitted from stimulating discussions with r. fosbury and j. vernet on the subject of dust scattering , and with c. jean on the subject of reddening models of galaxy spectra .",
