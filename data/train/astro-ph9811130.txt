    "the cartwheel galaxy , discovered by zwicky ( @xcite ) , earned its nickname from the prominent system of spokes which connects the bright outer ring to the inner ring ( see figure  [ co ] ) .",
    "the nature of the cartwheel was elucidated by early numerical simulations , which showed convincingly that such ring systems can form when a companion galaxy plunges through the centre of a larger rotating disk ( lynds & toomre @xcite ; theys & spiegel @xcite ) .",
    "the passage of the `` intruder '' triggers a ring - wave that propagates through the disk of the `` target '' galaxy and induces massive star formation in a well - defined ring .",
    "in contrast to most merging galaxies in which star formation is significantly enhanced in a very small area ( the very centre ) , ring galaxies exhibit starbursts on a large scale .",
    "most observed ring galaxies have blue colours and elevated co , h@xmath7 , far - infrared and radio continuum emission ( see appleton & struck - marcell @xcite for a review ) .",
    "because of the simple geometry of the interaction , they appear as textbook examples to study the effects that a collision has on the interstellar medium of a galaxy and to follow the chronology of the star - formation in the expanding ring .    the cartwheel galaxy ,",
    "because of its well - defined inner and outer rings , is considered as the prototype of its class .",
    "it has been the subject of several observational studies as well as dynamical modeling ( struck - marcell & higdon @xcite ; hernquist & weil @xcite ; mihos & hernquist @xcite ) .",
    "optical and near - ir imaging showed strong radial colour gradients in the disk interior to the outer ring , which may trace the evolution of the stellar population in the wake of the density wave ( marcum et al .",
    "hst images have revealed with unprecedented detail the distribution of massive young clusters in the outer ring , as well as the diffuse and knotty structure of the spokes ( borne et al .",
    "@xcite ; appleton et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the outer ring of the cartwheel ( @xmath8 70@xmath9 in diameter ) is expanding , has blue colours and is populated by massive star - forming regions ( higdon @xcite , amram et al .",
    "most of the star formation occurs in the southern quadrant of the ring , where the h@xmath10 emission , as well as the 20 cm and 6 cm radio continuum emission peak ( higdon @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopy of a few regions in the outer ring indicates a low metallicity ( fosbury & hawarden @xcite ) .",
    "most of the atomic gas ( ) is associated with the outer ring .",
    "the detection of a massive plume extending more than 80 kpc in projection in the direction of a companion galaxy ( g3 ) suggests that g3 rather than one of the two nearer companions collided with the cartwheel and produced its present - day appearance ( higdon @xcite ) .",
    "the inner ring ( @xmath8 18@xmath9 in diameter ) and nucleus of the cartwheel seem gas - poor and until recently , no evidence of star formation could be found .",
    "this is in disagreement with the models that predict an infall of gas towards the centre and vigorous star formation in the inner ring ( struck - marcell & appleton @xcite ) .",
    "however , a number of recent observations has revealed a richer environment in the inner regions of the cartwheel :    \\i ) the hst images resolve a network of dust lanes in the inner ring and luminous kiloparsec - size cometary structures which are suggestive of massive dense clouds traveling through the ambient gas ( struck et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\ii ) h@xmath7 emission has been detected at a low level throughout the inner ring and nucleus ( amram et al .",
    "@xcite , higdon et al .",

    "\\iii ) isocam images show strong 7@xmath11 m and 15@xmath11 m emission in the inner ring and nucleus .",
    "the mid - ir fluxes indicate the presence of hot dust and are consistent with weak star formation activity ( charmandaris et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these new results strengthened our expectation that molecular gas must be present in the central region of the cartwheel .",
    "previous searches for @xmath0co(j=10 ) line emission had been unsuccessful , and the cartwheel was one of the two galaxies that remained undetected in the survey of 16 ring galaxies of horellou et al . (",
    "1995 ) . here , we present the first @xmath0co(10 ) and @xmath0co(21 ) detections towards the centre of the cartwheel . for @xmath12=75kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 ,",
    "the distance to the galaxy is 121 mpc .",
    "we have observed at @xmath7=00h37m40.8s , @xmath14=@xmath1542@xmath1656.9@xmath1 ( j2000 ) , which is the peak of emission of the cartwheel nucleus in the hst i  band image .",
    "the observations have been carried out in july 1998 in la silla ( chile ) with the 15 m swedish - eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ) ( booth et al .",
    "@xcite ) . we used the iram 115 and 230 ghz receivers to observe simultaneously at the frequencies of the @xmath0co(10 ) and the @xmath0co(21 ) lines . at 115 ghz and 230 ghz ,",
    "the telescope half - power beam widths are 43@xmath1 and 22@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the main - beam efficiency of sest is @xmath17@xmath18=0.68 at 115 ghz and 0.46 at 230 ghz ( sest handbook , eso ) .",
    "the typical system temperature varied between 220 and 320 k ( in @xmath19 unit ) at both frequencies .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 6 hours .",
    "a balanced on - off dual beam switching mode was used , with a frequency of 6 hz and two symmetric reference positions offset by 12@xmath16 in azimuth .",
    "the pointing was regularly checked on the sio maser r aqr .",
    "the pointing accuracy was 4@xmath1 rms .",
    "the backends were low - resolution acousto - optical spectrometers .",
    "the total bandwidth available was 500 mhz at 115 ghz and 1 ghz at 230 ghz , with a velocity resolution of 1.8 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the data were reduced with the software class .",
    "only first - order baselines were subtracted from the spectra .",
    "in figure  [ co ] we present the co(10 ) and co(21 ) spectra obtained towards the centre of the cartwheel , as well as the hst image ( borne et al .",
    "@xcite ) on which the sizes of the co beams have been superimposed .",
    "the parameters of the lines , derived from gaussian fits after smoothing to a final velocity resolution of 15 km s@xmath13 , are given in table  [ results ] .",
    "the central velocities agree with the systemic velocity of 9089kms@xmath13 determined from observations ( higdon @xcite ) .",
    "an indicative molecular gas mass within the co(10 ) beam is given in the last column of table  [ results ] .",
    "it has been computed using a standard co - h@xmath2 conversion factor ( see below ) .",
    ".observational results .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      to convert co intensities into h@xmath2 column densities , we use the factor of strong et al .",
    "( @xcite ) :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the main - beam line area .",
    "this yields a mass    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the half - power beam width of the telescope .    from the co(10 ) line intensity , we estimate a mass of molecular gas ( h@xmath2 ) of 1.5 10@xmath24 m@xmath4 within the 43@xmath1 beam . this value should be interpreted with caution since it is known that the co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor ( @xmath25 ) is dependent on the metallicity ( e.g. maloney & black @xcite ) . due to the very weak line emission in the centre",
    ", the metallicity could be measured only in the outer star - forming ring of the cartwheel , and it is 12+log[o / h]=8.1 ( fosbury & hawarden @xcite ) , compared with 8.9 in orion .",
    "if the nucleus has the same metallicity as the outer ring , then the conversion factor would be higher than the standard one by a factor of about 4 ( wilson @xcite ) , and the h@xmath2 mass as well .",
    "however , it is also known that most galactic disks present a metallicity gradient , with metallicities in the nucleus up to @xmath26 times higher than in the outer parts of the disk ( smartt & rolleston @xcite ) .",
    "although @xmath25 may vary linearly with the reciprocal of metallicity when the metallicity is low , @xmath25 is expected to become less sensitive to metallicity at values above that of orion ( sakamoto @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if we take into account the metallicity gradient across the disk , the value of @xmath25 for the nucleus of the cartwheel might be not much lower than the standard value .",
    "we can bracket the conversion factor in the nucleus : @xmath27 , and the h@xmath2 mass within the 43@xmath1 beam : @xmath28 < 6 \\ , 10 ^ 9 .",
    "$ ]    h@xmath2 masses in this range are common for central regions of normal spirals of intermediate and late types ( e.g. , see fig . 133 in young et al .",
    "@xcite ) and are similar to those inferred for other ring galaxies ( horellou et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    more unusual is the fact that we observe similar integrated intensity in the co(10 ) and co(21 ) lines , despite the difference of a factor of 4 in the beam areas .",
    "if the co lines were thermalized , this would imply that the surface density of the co gas would be nearly constant within the 25 kpc co(10 ) beam diameter , which is very improbable .",
    "the surface density of most disk galaxies shows an exponential radial decrease . even if the spokes were gas - rich , as some numerical simulations predict ( hernquist & weil @xcite , mihos & hernquist @xcite ) , their filling factor is likely to be low . for a linear decrease of the surface density ,",
    "one expects a line ratio of 0.5 .",
    "we rather suggest that the co(21 ) emission is sub - thermal , possibly because of a low temperature or a low gas density , and that the co emission is concentrated within the 13 kpc co(21 ) beam ( which is consistent with the fact that both lines have similar widths ) .",
    "correcting for the different beam sizes , one obtains a co(21)/co(10 ) line ratio of 0.3 @xmath29 , which is significantly lower than the ratio of 0.9 observed in nearby spirals ( braine & combes @xcite ) .",
    "such low ratios have been observed in dark clouds of m31 where there is little evidence of star - forming activity ( allen & lequeux @xcite ) .",
    "let us try to compare the spatial distribution and kinematical signature of the co gas with those of the atomic and the ionized hydrogen .",
    "neutral hydrogen is undetected within the central @xmath30 of the galaxy ( @xmath31 ( ) @xmath32 0.3 m@xmath6 pc@xmath33 ) and has a roughly constant surface density from @xmath34 to 22@xmath1 .",
    "( @xmath31 ( ) @xmath35 4 m@xmath6 pc@xmath33 , higdon @xcite ) .",
    "the mass within our 43@xmath1 co(10 ) beam is 1.5 10@xmath24 m@xmath6 , which is of the same order as the molecular gas mass that we have calculated , but it is only @xmath5 m@xmath6 within the 22@xmath1 co(21 ) beam . if , as argued in the previous paragraph , the co emission is concentrated , then the interstellar medium within the central 22@xmath1 is predominantly molecular .",
    "the @xmath36 rotation curve rises smoothly from the inner to the outer ring ( see figure  [ vrot ] ) .",
    "atomic gas is infalling near the inner ring , where @xmath36 concentrations are seen .",
    "assuming that the co gas is distributed in an inclined plane ( @xmath37 ) , we can use the line widths to estimate the rotational velocity in the central region of the galaxy . for the co(21 )",
    "line we find @xmath38=@xmath39= 138 km s@xmath13 which is significantly higher than the velocities measured for the gas at radii @xmath40 ( see fig .  [ vrot ] ) .",
    "the co point is more consistent with the h@xmath10 rotation curve .",
    "the difference between the velocity on one hand and the h@xmath7 and co velocities on the other hand is likely to be due to different distributions of the atomic and molecular gas , the latter being more concentrated .",
    "we have presented the first detection of @xmath0co(10 ) and @xmath0co(21 ) line emission towards the nucleus of the cartwheel galaxy and estimated the mass of molecular gas within the central 43@xmath1 ( 1.5 10@xmath41 m(h@xmath2 ) @xmath42 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "the limited angular resolution of these single - dish observations does not allow us to determine precisely the location of the molecular gas , but it is probably concentrated within the central @xmath43 where little atomic gas is found ( @xmath5 m@xmath6 , higdon @xcite ) .",
    "the co(21 ) to ( 10 ) line ratio is low , suggesting sub - thermal excitation , which is consistent with the low level of star - forming activity observed in the central region of the cartwheel .",
    "these co measurements make it possible to justify future interferometric observations to study the distribution and the dynamics of the molecular gas with a better spatial resolution and to establish whether it is associated with the inner ring and/or the dust - lanes , and whether it is of pre - collisional origin or infalling onto the nucleus as numerical simulations predict .",
