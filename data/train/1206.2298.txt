    "systems of cold atoms have become an enormously rich playground for the study of strongly correlated quantum matter .",
    "this era was probably heralded by the observation of the superfluid to mott insulator phase transition is systems of @xmath0 loaded in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "since then , the possibility of a great amount of control over the parameters of these systems has attracted the attention of both the atomic and the condensed matter physics communities @xcite .",
    "more recently , the ability to introduce quenched disorder into the system in a controlled manner has provided researchers with yet another ` knob ' to be turned in these studies @xcite .",
    "disorder can be incorporated in several ways , namely , through the addition of laser speckle patterns to the optical lattice potential @xcite , through the creation of a quasi - random optical profile by means of different laser fields with incommensurate frequencies@xcite , by means of randomly trapped atomic ` impurities ' @xcite , or even random magnetic fields close to a feshbach resonance which can modify locally the scattering length between the atoms @xcite .",
    "this great flexibility holds a great deal of promise in the study of the interplay between interactions and disorder , a problem of enormous importance in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "one other attractive feature of cold atomic systems is the fact that they can often be very efficiently described by the simple effective models of condensed matter physics , with much better justification for the approximations made in arriving at these models .",
    "foremost among these is the bose - hubbard model for spin - zero bosons , which forms the paradigm for theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the conventional magnetic traps frequently used , the internal degrees of freedom ( spins ) of the atoms are frozen and they can be described as spinless bosons . however , in purely optical traps the spins are liberated and the condensates formed depend crucially on the degeneracy of the atomic spinor @xcite .",
    "again , the usual approximation of retaining only low - energy _",
    "s_-wave scattering between atoms justifies the description of these systems by means of the bose - hubbard model generalized for particles with spin greater than or equal to one @xcite .    a fairly good yet simple treatment of the spin - zero bose - hubbard model is afforded by the so - called ` site - decoupled ' mean - field theory @xcite , which is able , in particular , to identify the phases of the model and the topology of the phase diagram at zero temperature .",
    "the latter exhibits ( i ) a superfluid ( sf ) phase , characterized by a macroscopic occupation of the lowest single - particle state ( the @xmath1 state in the case of equilibrium ) @xcite or , equivalently , by the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry @xcite , and ( ii ) a series of mott insulator ( mi ) lobes , each characterized by an integer occupation per site and a vanishing compressibility due to the presence of an interaction - induced gap .",
    "this is in good qualitative agreement with other more accurate methods ( see , e. g. , ) .",
    "this mean - field theory was extended to the spin-1 case and used not only for the analysis of the ground state of the model @xcite but also for finite temperatures @xcite . in the pioneering work of reference ,",
    "the ground state phase diagram was determined for an antiferromagnetic intra - site interaction .",
    "it was found that , although both superfluid ( sf ) and mott insulating ( mi ) phases are found , like in the spin - zero case , in contrast to the latter there are two qualitatively different mi lobes : those with an odd number of bosons combined in a total spin 1 composite per site , and even - numbered lobes with a total spin singlet per site .",
    "moreover , the sf phase was found to have a so - called ` polar ' structure , corresponding to a spin - zero condensate .",
    "the presence of a non - zero spin per site can lead to a non - trivial magnetic order .",
    "indeed , it has been proposed that the mi phases can show spin nematic order , a state with broken spin rotational symmetry but unbroken time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "although the clean bose - hubbard models have by now been fairly well studied , the introduction of quenched disorder poses a much more complex problem . in the ground - breaking work of reference ,",
    "scaling arguments were used to address the zero - temperature phase diagram , the associated quantum phase transitions , and other physical properties of the disordered spin - zero bose - hubbard model .",
    "perhaps the most important conclusion of that work was the prediction of a new bose glass ( bg ) phase , which is characterized by localized , insulating behavior in the absence of an excitation gap and hence , with a finite , non - zero compressibility .",
    "although the unbiased confirmation of the existence of this phase by numerical methods is highly non - trivial , there is by fairly good evidence in favor of it ( see , e. g. , ) .",
    "a theoretical study of the effects of disorder in the spin-1 bose - hubbard model was carried out in reference , in which the ground state phase diagram was determined by using the gutzwiller variational method and a mean - field theory based on the arithmetic average of the sf order parameter . for the case of diagonal disorder ( i. e. , randomness in the local orbital energies ) , it was found that the odd - numbered mi lobes are rapidly transformed into a bg regions , whereas the even - numbered ones are much more robust with respect to randomness , requiring a much larger strength of disorder before they also turn into a bg .    the ` site - decoupled ' mean - field theory mentioned above can be readily generalized to the disordered case , although its full solution requires numerical work @xcite . a great deal of insight into this approach",
    "can be gained , however , through a simplification proposed in .",
    "it consists of directing the focus of attack towards the determination of the probability density distribution function of local sf order parameters , @xmath2 . after ignoring correlations among order parameters in nearby sites ,",
    "the next step is to establish a mean - field self - consistent condition to be satisfied by @xmath2 .",
    "this method was dubbed stochastic mean field theory ( smft ) because it has an immediate formulation as a stochastic equation .",
    "the method offers some advantages over alternative approaches in that it does not suffer from finite - size effects and crucially , it allows a great deal of analytical control , specially over the probability distribution of local quantities . it does have the drawback of predicting a direct mi - sf transition at weak disorder without an intervening bg phase , which can be ruled out on firm theoretical grounds @xcite",
    "nevertheless , despite this shortcoming , it provides a fairly powerful tool for the analysis of these intricate disordered systems . indeed , qualitatively the overall phase boundaries obtained within smft for the zero spin case agree well @xcite with quantum monte carlo results in finite lattices @xcite .",
    "we should also mention the important analysis of the disordered spin zero boson problem afforded by the real space renormalization group appropriate for strong disorder @xcite , a powerful tool especially in low dimensions .",
    "it focused on a quantum rotor representation believed to be equivalent to the bose - hubbard hamiltonian in the limit of a large number of bosons per site .",
    "the system was thoroughly characterized in one spatial dimension @xcite , which is special since there can be only quasi - long range ( power - law ) superfluid order in the ground state . like the clean case",
    ", the quantum superfluid - insulator transition belongs to the kosterlitz - thouless universality class . in the disordered case , however , this transition can occur at arbitrarily weak interactions , which sets it apart for its higher - dimensional counterparts .",
    "the insulating phase has the expected features ( i.e. a finite compressibility ) of a bose glass for generic disorder .",
    "other types of disorder with special particle - hole symmetry properties were also considered , in which case the insulator can have vanishing ( the so - called mott glass ) or infinite compressibility ( dubbed a random singlet glass ) .",
    "more recently , this approach has been extended to two dimensions @xcite , in which case the transition is governed by a more conventional unstable fixed point at finite interaction strength .",
    "however , this was confined to the non - generic particle - hole symmetric disorder that does not give rise to a bose glass phase .",
    "it should be mentioned that all fixed points found show finite effective disorder , which renders the method less conclusive than at other infinite disorder fixed points for which the method is asymptotically exact .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the disordered spin-1 bose - hubbard model with the tools of the smft @xcite .",
    "we will focus our attention on the antiferromagnetic interaction case only .",
    "we have found that the phase diagram of reference is well captured by this simplified approach .",
    "furthermore , we are also able to find a number of distribution functions of local quantities which offer a great deal of insight into the nature of the various phases , namely , the local spinor order parameters , the average and the standard deviation of the site occupation , and the total spin per site . finally , by analyzing the behavior of the system both as a function of interactions and as a function of disorder strength we track the hierarchical transformation of the mi lobes into bg phases .",
    "it should be mentioned that , unlike in the original application of the smft @xcite , we use an alternative stochastic approach to solve the smft equations which was first suggested in reference and used extensively in and proves to be quite efficient and flexible .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model_h ] , we present the model and review the phase diagram both in the clean and disordered cases . in section [ sec : smft ] , we explain how the smft is defined and also describe our strategy for solving the corresponding equations .",
    "we then present our results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we wrap up with some conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we will focus on a generalized disordered hubbard model for bosons with total spin @xmath3 @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 creates a bosonic atom with spin projection @xmath6 in an optical lattice wannier function centered on the site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath9 is the chemical potential ( we will work in the grand - canonical ensemble ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are local ( intra - site ) coupling constants for spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions , respectively , and @xmath12 are the spin-1 matrices given by    @xmath13    the interaction coupling constants can be related to the @xmath14-wave scattering lengths of two bosons in vacuum with total spin 0 ( @xmath15 ) and 2 ( @xmath16 ) ( the symmetric nature of their wave function forbidding @xmath14-wave processes with total spin 1 ) @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the boson mass and @xmath19 is the integral of the fourth power of the wannier wave function . as per the usual nomenclature ,",
    "the spin - dependent interaction is called ferromagnetic , when @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) and antiferromagnetic if @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) @xcite . on - site disorder is introduced through the parameters @xmath24 , which are taken to be random quantities with no spatial correlations .",
    "although several models of disorder may be considered , for simplicity we chose @xmath24 to be distributed according to a uniform distribution of width @xmath25 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the single - site operators for the total number of bosons @xmath26 and total spin @xmath27 , @xmath28 in terms of which the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath29    in the clean limit , the model exhibits two phases : a superfluid phase ( sf ) and several lobes of mott insulating ( mi ) behavior @xcite .",
    "the sf is the so - called polar state , characterized by a spin - zero bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . as any superfluid state",
    ", it can be characterized by the appearance of a non - zero value of @xmath30 for some component @xmath31 , and this situation corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "a convenient , albeit not unique choice for the order parameter structure of the polar state is @xmath32 .",
    "the mi lobes , on the other hand , can be classified in two categories : those that correspond to an odd number @xmath33 of bosons per site ( here , @xmath34 is the number of sites ) , which combine to form a spin-1 object on each site , and lobes in which each site has a 0-spin even @xmath35 combination . generically , the even - numbered lobes are more stable and tend to occupy a larger fraction of the @xmath9 versus @xmath8 phase diagram as compared to the nearby odd - numbered lobes , which are smaller and disappear altogether for @xmath36 . in addition , for @xmath37 the even - numbered mi - sf quantum phase transition is first order in character , as opposed to the odd - numbered one which is always continuous . for @xmath38 ,",
    "all mi - sf transitions are continuous @xcite .",
    "finally , the mi is characterized by a vanishing compressibility @xmath39 , which in contrast remains non - zero in the sf .",
    "once disorder is turned on , a new phase appears : the bose glass ( bg ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is not a sf and therefore the order parameter is zero for any value of @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely , since @xmath40 becomes a random quantity in the disordered system , its distribution is given by @xmath41 for any @xmath31 .",
    "however , unlike the mi phase , the charge excitation spectrum is gapless and the fluid is compressible : @xmath42 .",
    "a full specification of all phases thus requires the computation of the order parameter distribution and the compressibility .",
    "it should be noted that there was a long - standing controversy over whether the topology of the phase diagram is such as to allow a direct transition from a mi to a sf , without passing through an intervening bg phase .",
    "scaling arguments suggested that such a direct mi - sf transition is unlikely in the presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "however , numerical results proved to be inconclusive ( see , e. g. , and ) .",
    "more recently , extreme - statistics arguments have been used to show that there are necessarily extended lifshitz regions of gapless particle - hole excitations at the sf phase boundary @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems clear now that there is always a bg phase adjacent to the sf and a direct mi - sf is not possible in the disordered case .",
    "the superfluid - mott insulator transition of lattice bosons can be qualitatively captured by a standard mean field approach which is based upon decoupling the hopping term of the hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( ) ) as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 and we are neglecting second - order fluctuations @xmath45 .",
    "the order parameters @xmath40 have to be determined self - consistently .",
    "this is achieved by focusing on the decoupled single - site hamiltonians generated after is applied to    @xmath46    where @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the lattice coordination number .",
    "once @xmath49 is determined from ( note the dependence on the local site energy @xmath24 and adjacent order parameters @xmath50 ) , self - consistency is assured if we impose that @xmath51    complete lattice self - consistency requires solving the large set of coupled equations defined by eqs . .",
    "a considerable simplification can be achieved if we neglect _ spatial correlations _ between sites .",
    "this defines the so - called _ stochastic mean field theory _ ( smft ) of references , which was originally proposed for the spin-0 model , but which we will now describe for the generic spinful case .",
    "for this , we note that @xmath52 depends on the other order parameters only through @xmath53 , see eq . .",
    "we thus look for the distributions of local order parameters @xmath54 by first finding the distributions of @xmath53 , @xmath55 , which are induced by @xmath54 through eq .",
    ", _ neglecting spatial correlations between different nearest neighbors_. next , we use the fixed function @xmath56 , which usually has to be obtained numerically , to generate the induced distributions @xmath57 . finally , self - consistency is obtained by imposing that @xmath58 . despite its approximate nature , this approach has been shown to be able to capture all the phases of the spin-0 model @xcite .    the procedure described above for the smft can be implemented as a non - linear integral equation for the sought distributions @xmath54 , which can then be solved numerically on a discrete mesh .",
    "this was the approach used in references .",
    "we opted instead to use an importance sampling method , akin to the monte carlo method , as originally proposed for the self - consistent theory of localization @xcite .",
    "the method can be described as follows .",
    "we start from a sample of random values for @xmath59 which are drawn from an initial guess for the sought distributions , @xmath60 .",
    "the method is very robust with respect to the choice of this initial guess , so we can start with a uniform distribution . from this initial sample ,",
    "we generate a corresponding initial sample for @xmath61 using eq . , which may be viewed as an initial guess @xmath62 . using the latter and a corresponding sample of @xmath63 values of @xmath24 drawn from its ( given ) distribution , we can then find ( numerically solving for @xmath52 according to ) a new sample of values of the order parameter @xmath64 , which can be viewed as drawn from an improved distribution @xmath65 .",
    "the sample size will have decreased by a factor of @xmath66 from the previous iteration . for further iterations , we can enlarge this smaller sample to the original size by replicating it @xmath48 times and reshuffling it . for a large enough value of @xmath67 this leads to negligible errors , which can be checked by studying the dependence of the final results on @xmath67 .",
    "the procedure can then be iterated many times until sample - to - sample variations are negligible , which can be verified , for example , by computing sample features such as its mean and variance . a numerical estimate of the converged distribution",
    "is then obtained from a histogram of the last several iterations .",
    "furthermore , histograms of any local quantities can also be easily generated .",
    "we have compared the two different methods of solving the smft equations , namely , the stochastic method proposed in this paper and the direct solution of the integral equation used in references , in the spin zero case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin0 ] , we show a typical result for the order parameter distribution @xmath2 obtained by these two methods , within the disordered bose - einstein condensed phase of the spin zero disordered hubbard model . the importance sampling approach used @xmath68 and it took 30 iterations for the convergence to be achieved , after which 70 more iterations were obtained to generate the final statistics",
    "the agreement is remarkable and makes us confident that the method is reliable .",
    "in fact , we achieved enough accuracy with @xmath69 , 40 iterations before convergence and 60 more to gather enough statistics .",

    "the full blue line was obtained with the importance sampling method used in this paper and the symbols come from solving directly the integral equation ( extracted from reference ) . ]    finally , we should mention that the direct computation of the compressibility within smft points to a direct transition between the mi and the sf at weak disorder @xcite , which is at odds with the rigorous results of .",
    "the smft is thus incapable of capturing the rare regions of gapless charge excitations close to the sf phase that preclude such a direct transition .",
    "arguments have been given in , showing how to reinterpret the smft phase diagram in order to correct for this failure .",
    "nevertheless , it should be kept in mind that the direct calculation of @xmath74 does not show the expected behavior .    in the next section",

    "the transition from sf to both types of mi is continuous for this value of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we then add disorder ( @xmath72 ) within a smft treatment .",
    "we were able to find only converged solutions with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "in other words , although the order parameter is now a random quantity , it still preserves the same component structure as in the clean case .",

    "the boundaries of the mott lobes of the clean case are shown as black dotted lines for comparison .",
    "there is a clear suppression of the regions with a vanishing order parameter ( blue regions ) , except at the wedges that separate the clean mott lobes , where superfluid order is suppressed .",
    "a definite characterization of the non - superfluid regions will be carried out later , when we show the results for the compressibility in section [ sec : compressibility ] .",
    "we anticipate that the large even - numbered lobes will retain their mott insulating character .",
    "there is a clear suppression of these lobes by disorder , which are seen to become narrower and to extend up to smaller maximum values of the hopping amplitude as compared to the clean case .",

    "their shape is completely deformed by disorder .",
    "the conclusion is that the even - numbered mi lobes are more resilient to the effects of disorder . just like in the clean case",
    ", the positive value of @xmath11 , which stabilizes the even occupation , also acts to localize the bosons more strongly , thus protecting the mi phase against weak disorder .",
