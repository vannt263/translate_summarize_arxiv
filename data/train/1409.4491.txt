    "the bicep2 team has announced discovery of _ b _ polarization modes on angular scales of @xmath6 to @xmath7 ( @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) which are of an amplitude and angular scale that are too large to be due to gravitational lensing ( bicep2 collaboration 2014 ) .",
    "these  are just in line with what would be expected from gravity waves from the early universe ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1997 , kamionkowski  1997 ) .",
    "their results suggest that if dust contamination is small ( they have picked a region of the sky with very little foreground dust ) , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is @xmath10 as compared with a value of @xmath11 expected from simple single - field slow - roll chaotic inflation ( linde 1983 ) with a simple quadratic potential @xmath12 representing a simple massive scalar field ( with mass @xmath13)for possible implications for dark energy , see slepian  2014 , gott & slepian 2011 .",
    "the bicep2  map is several @xmath14 in terms of signal - to - noise , and they find the same modes however they rotate their telescope and whether they consider the first or last half of their data .",
    "there thus seems little question that this signal is on the sky and not an instrumental effect .",
    "a simulation they present shows that the  observed have significantly larger amplitude than would be expected from gravitational lensing .",
    "the main question seems to be whether the  could instead be due entirely to  produced by foreground dust .",
    "the bicep2 team estimates that the dust contamination is low corresponding to a false value of @xmath15 at most , and that their signal is produced by gravity waves with @xmath16 .",
    "the bicep2 region was chosen to be one of the least contaminated by dust in the entire sky .",
    "mortonson , and seljak ( 2014 ) and flauger , hill & spergel ( 2014 ) argue that given the uncertainties of the amplitude of the dust polarization at the bicep2 frequency of 150 ghz one can not say conclusively at present whether the  detected by bicep2 are due to gravity waves or just polarized dust .",
    "all of these studies looked at the power spectrum of the .",
    "flauger , hill & spergel ( 2014 ) in particular , fitting the  power spectrum on the @xmath6 to @xmath7 scale , find that a model with @xmath10 and no appreciable dust polarization ( reduced @xmath17 ) is acceptable , as well as a model with @xmath18 and dust  ( reduced @xmath19 ) .",
    "they thus conclude that given the present uncertainty in the amplitude of the dust emission  at 150 ghz one can not say at present whether the bicep2  are due to gravity waves or dust polarization .",
    "those authors have digitized a publicly available planck polarization map to compare with the bicep2 map .",
    "we will similarly digitize and utilize this publicly available planck polarization map in our study .",
    "the main uncertainty seems to be the amplitude of the dust signal in the bicep2 map .",
    "therefore we designed a study to test between a gravity wave versus dust origin for the bicep2  that does not depend on the amplitude of the dust signal at all .",
    "we have previously used genus statistics to study the 3d topology of large scale structure and the 2d topology of hot and cold spots in the microwave background .",
    "the results of all these studies have been consistent with gaussian random phase initial conditions demanded by inflation ( gott  2007 , colley  2003 , colley  1996 ) . in the cosmic microwave background",
    "our genus statistic is @xmath20 = number of hot spots @xmath21 number of cold spots , where @xmath22 is the number of standard deviations above the mean temperature . for a gaussian random phase distribution @xmath23 .",
    "we ( colley & gott 2003 ) have found that the genus topology of the wmap temperature field is in agreement with the gaussian random phase model .",
    "departures from a gaussian random phase distribution can be quantified by the parameter @xmath24 invented by komatsu & spergel ( 2000 ) .",
    "a perfect gaussian random phase distribution would have @xmath25 .",
    "the smallest detectable levels from the cmb would be of order 5 .",
    "standard slow - roll inflation ( a simple field rolling down a hill ) predicts values of @xmath24 of @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( close to zero and undetectable with current data ) according to calculations by maldacena ( 2005 ) and others . for gravity waves",
    "maldacena and pimentel ( 2011 ) conclude that @xmath28 , again essentially undetectable .",
    "thus , standard inflation predicts values of @xmath24 near zero  consistent with a gaussian random phase distribution . for comparison ,",
    "the cobe results set 68% confidence limits of @xmath29 . using 2d genus topology on the wmap data",
    ", we were able to improve these limits to @xmath30 at the 95% confidence level ( gott  2007 ) .",
    "the wmap team found @xmath31 with an independent analysis ( spergel  2007 ) .",
    "all these ranges are consistent with @xmath24 near zero .",
    "the planck satellite , drawing upon a much higher resolution map , and testing for random phases with a different ( bi - spectrum ) method , has recently found @xmath32 ( at 68% confidence ) ( planck collaboration 2013 ) , again consistent with @xmath25 and the predictions of standard inflation .",
    "gravity waves should thus produce gaussian random phase fields to our limits of detection with 2d genus topology .",
    "the differential operators used to calculate the when applied to a gaussian random field , yield a gaussian random field .",
    "this is particularly clear when one considers this in spherical harmonics where the operators applied to the _ q _ and _ u _ maps are calculated by multiplying @xmath33 s by factors involving @xmath34 , but the gaussian form of their amplitude distributions and their random phases are not altered . therefore , if the  from bicep2 are cosmological , due to gravity waves in the early universe we expect their genus curves to be consistent with the gaussian random phase formula .",
    "if that is observed it will favor gravity waves over dust polarization because dust polarization in a low dust region is not necessarily guaranteed to be gaussian random phase , consisting of perhaps only a few polarizing sheets of dust in the line of sight .",
    "this phase of the study uses only the bicep2 data with no reliance on planck data at all .    in the second phase of the study , we will use the publicly available planck data at 353 ghz ( stokes polarization parameters _ q _ and _ u _ ) to compute the _ b _ polarization modes . at this frequency ,",
    "polarized  emission is surely dominated by dust ; so we will assume that any signal in the _ b _ polarization modes is due to dust .",
    "we will then compare the genus curve for the planck 353 ghz map to that seen in the bicep2 data .",
    "if they agree , that is evidence in favor of @xmath18 and dust polarization only .",
    "in addition we will compare the 353 ghz  map with the bicep2  map . if the two agree with positive and negative ( clockwise and counterclockwise swirls in polarization ) regions at the same locations",
    "this would constitute a proof that the bicep2  polarization was due to dust and not cosmological .",
    "it would falsify the claim that the particular  seen in the bicep2 map were due to gravity waves .",
    "we are making no specific assumption about the amplitude of the polarization at 150 ghz , just that the dust is in the same locations and that the polarization angles are similar at the two frequencies .",
    "if the  from the dust are non - gaussian random phase , all the better .",
    "we expect the  from the dust to produce a complicated map , which we will compare directly to the  in the bicep2 data to look for coincidences .",
    "if all the features detected in the bicep2  map are explained by features already found in the planck dust dominated  map the detection of gravity waves will be falsified .",
    "the study is designed to go either way : supporting the detection of gravity waves if the bicep2  map is gaussian random phase and quite different from the planck 353 ghz  map , and refuting the detection if the bicep2 and planck 353 ghz  maps are nearly identical .",
    "previous studies have considered the power spectrum of the . but this leaves out the other information in the maps .",
    "one of us ( wnc ) , in his thesis produced two maps with identical power spectra , where one was gaussian random phase and the other showed a taco bell logo ( colley 1998 ) .",
    "the only difference was the non - random phase nature of the second picture .",
    "the first picture looked like noise , and in the second one could see a blurry taco bell sign .",
    "the genus statistic easily distinguished between these two ; the first fit the gaussian random phase formula @xmath23 , while the second just counted the particular cold spots for the letters and stylized bell in the logo over a wide range of @xmath22 , and was not in agreement with the random phase formula . looking at the power spectrum alone is insufficient .",
    "it is important whether the  detected by bicep2 show up in the planck dust polarization  maps or not .",
    "note we are only considering the locations of the features not their amplitude .",
    "and we are only making use of the publicly available bicep2 data and planck data that were already utilized by the bicep2 team and flauger , hill , and spergel ( 2014 ) .",
    "we are just using them in a different , and complimentary way .",
    "to create a usable version of the bicep2 data , we first had to convert the figures from the pdf document ( bicep2 collaboration 2014b ) into usable data , showing the amplitude of the  as a function of position on the sky .",
    "the pdf shows the _",
    "e- _ and  signals observed by bicep and simulated _ e _ and _ b _ maps of expected backgrounds , chiefly gravitational lensing .",
    "first , we simply displayed the pdf such that each figure was at nearly the full resolution of the screen ( a standard 1920@xmath351080 hd display ) , and used a screen grabber to generate a png image .",
    "these maps present the major difficulty in that they are shown with black `` headless '' vector indicators of the polarization direction . to handle this",
    ", we created a custom java program that first displays the trace of the color table ( from the scale bar ) on top of three two - dimensional histograms of pixel values in the map , where the axes of these histograms are the r and g levels , the g and b levels and the b and r levels in the rgb pixel data .",
    "what was quite apparent was that the majority of the pixel data indeed lay along the trace of the color table from the scale bar , but that there were also `` echoes '' of this trace at lower intensity for a much lower number of pixels .",
    "these turn out to be the pixels where there is anti - aliasing of the black headless vector segments .",
    "fortunately , these echoes are sufficiently separated from the full intensity color table trace that one can readily identify which pixels have the full intensity , and which do not ( in practice , for each pixel we found the minimum rgb distance from segments along the natural color table trace , and any with a minimum distance of greater than 4 was regarded to be corrupted by headless vector segment or its anti - aliasing pixels ) . for each excluded pixel",
    ", we searched to find the nearest 3 non - excluded pixels that geometrically enclosed the original pixel .",
    "this forms three triangles in the spaces @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . treating each triangle as a plane , we interpolated to the original pixel location and used that interpolated value to replace the original excluded pixel value .",
    "the natural outputs are png maps on which the headless vectors have been removed . however , because we have referenced to the the scale bar color table in this process , we can also output each map s values in physical units .",
    "we now have physical - unit maps for each of the four original map images ( _ e _ , _ b _ , simulated _ e _ and simulated _ b _ ) . for analysis , we smooth these maps with a gaussian kernel with @xmath39 pixels .",
    "this not only smooths over the blocky appearance of the original bicep2 maps , but also smooths over the generally minor artifacts arising from the headless vector removal process .",
    "the next problem is that of the sensitivity , which is non - uniform across the maps .",
    "fortunately , the bicep2 collaboration ( 2014c ) has provided a map over their sensitivity in fig .",
    "we used this sensitivity map to normalize the bicep  data , and cut our analysis region to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , inside of which the lowest weight was roughly 0.3 .",
    "finally , we projected this flattened map into mercator ( fig .",
    "[ bicepbmerc ] ) and lambert equal - area cylindrical projections . using two different projections was necessary  for statistical measurements on the map , we chose the equal - area projection , but for the genus , we chose the mercator projection .",
    "the conformal mercator projection preserves angles on the sphere locally .",
    "this ensures that the density contour surfaces meet the survey boundary at the correct angles . the color scheme in fig .",
    "[ bicepbmerc ] is one we used in gott  ( 2007 ) .",

    "the stretch is from @xmath43 ( blue ) to @xmath44 ( red).,width=312 ]",
    "the planck team ( boulanger 2014 ) has provided the _ i _ , _ q _ and _ u _ maps of dust polarzation . the _ q _ and _ u _ maps are presented in a mollweide projection , with color table scales given below each .",
    "the first task is , therefore , to convert the color table images back to physical units .",
    "our process is quite similar to that described for the bicep2 map above , except without the pesky headless vectors to clean up .",
    "we first displayed the pdf and did a simple screen grab at a high zoom level , to convert the pdf data to standard png pixel data .",
    "in idl , at each pixel location , we found in rgb vector space the three rgb values from the color scale that minimized the distance between themselves and the pixel s rgb values .",
    "we then fit a quadratic function to the squared rgb distances .",
    "minimizing the quadratic gave us an interpolated locus on the color scale , which we translated to temperature using the scale s stated graduation .",
    "the result was a mollweide projection of both the _ q _ and _ u _ polarization maps in physical units , namely kelvins",
    ". but to compare with the bicep2  map , we obviously needed to convert the _",
    "q _ and _ u _ to _ b_.    for the  analysis , we used the healpix library ( e.g. , grski  2005 ) . using the idl interface , we iterated over all the healpix pixels at a resolution level of @xmath45 , and projected them back to the mollweide map to find the location in our _ q _ and _ u _ mollweide maps ( we simply used bilinear interpolation to estimate the temperature value at a particular healpix pixel location ) .",
    "we then had a healpix map for the _ q _ and _ u _ dust maps .",
    "computing the  values was straight - forward with the standard modules inside the healpix library ; the internal mathematical techniques are described by guzik  ( 2000 ) .",
    "our approach was to develop a c++ program which loaded the healpix _ q _ and _ u _ maps , and then called the map2alm_spin routine , whose documentation ( hivon 2010 ) explains that by calling the routine with a spin argument of 2 , it takes as input the _ q _ and _ u _ maps , and outputs the spin zero @xmath33 values for the _",
    "e- _ and  associated with the _ q _ and _ u _ polarizations . from there , it is just a matter of using the usual ( spin zero ) alm2map routine to convert @xmath33 values into a sky map of the  of the dust , as observed by planck .",
    "[ dustb ] shows the result of this process .",
    "[ dustbmerc ] shows the dust map in just the bicep2 region ( as a mercator projection ) .",
    "the planck  map described above ( fig .  [ dustbmerc ] ) clearly looks nothing like the bicep2  map .",
    "however , the bicep2 team conducted some data processing that one must mimic in order to conduct statistical analyses .",
    "in particular , the bicep2 map only shows modes from @xmath0 and has been `` desplined '' as we shall describe .",
    "we will use 5 somewhat different techniques with various degrees of complexity for achieving this .",
    "first , let us consider the effects of filtering the @xmath34 modes to @xmath46 . fig .",
    "[ dusttruncbicepreg ] shows the filtered planck 353 ghz  in the bicep2 region .",
    "note the striations .",
    "if we consider the whole sky for the same map ( fig .",
    "[ dusttruncwholesky ] ) , we see that the pattern of striations extends to larger scales in the low  regions .",
    "the filtering gives the map a uniformly choppy look because we are only looking at a small range of modes .",
    "the color scale saturates at pure red or pure blue beyond the extremes in  amplitude seen in the bicep2 region . fig .",
    "[ dusttruncbicepreg ] shows just the bicep2 region .",
    "it has a rainbow color scale for the amplitude of the  with the red end of the spectrum positive and the blue end of the spectrum negative .",
    "[ dusttruncwholesky ] shows this extended to the whole sky with the map saturating at pure red or pure blue if it exceeds the magnitude of the  seen anywhere in the bicep2 region .",
    "the modes @xmath0 are just the ones where the gravity waves might exceed the dust in bicep2 . at smaller scales",
    "gravitational lensing would dominate , and at larger scales dust would dominate because of its flatter power spectrum .",
    "the striations appear to cover the whole map running in different directions . in the galactic plane",
    "the striations have stripes parallel to the plane , but at high latitudes they run in different directions .",
    "some regions look more checkerboard like .",
    "the regions of highest @xmath0 amplitude ( pure red or pure blue ) follow the well - known structures in the galaxy , where the amplitude of dust emission is greatest .",
    "but the regions in rainbow colors like the bicep2 region all look surprisingly similar , suggesting we are looking at mostly instrumental and systematic noise .",
    "the striations appear to be due to ringing in these modes due to fitting the structures in high intensity regions .",
    "the unsaturated regions ( like bicep2 ) look surprisingly uniform , they all have striations that look surprisingly similar .",
    "once one hits the noise level , full of ringing modes , the sky looks relatively uniform .",
    "there are no areas of lower signal ( no large patches of pure green in the map ) .",
    "this suggests a large amount of noise dominating the dust signal .",
    "we have developed five different mapping techniques to address these issues and produce the best ( @xmath0 ) 353 ghz  map in the bicep2 region , with the least contamination from modes ringing off high intensity regions elsewhere in the sky .",
    "the bicep2 team only had data in their survey region and would not be influenced by modes ringing off structures elsewhere .",
    "the first map for analysis , map i , used the most straight - forward means of construction of our 5 maps . as with all maps",
    ", we took the @xmath33 modes from the _ b _ map produced by healpix analysis , and use only those with @xmath0 , to produce the output map .",
    "we further eliminated the @xmath47 modes ( in galactic coordinates ) , to dampen some of the ringing effects from the galactic plane discussed above . following the bicep2 team s techniques",
    ", we also corrected the map by subtracting the best - fit horizontal ( in right ascension ) cubic spline , with two intervals joined in the middle of the map ( which we shall call `` desplining '' ) .",
    "we use this in all our maps .    for map",
    "ii , we used a similar analysis procedure .",
    "however , we were more aggressive in addressing the ringing in the fourier modes from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "thus , we removed the plane by excising the 20% of the sky centered on the galactic equator , and smoothly interpolating across the region with a cosine - filter .",
    "this technique was quite successful in reducing the impact of the ringing , which can be seen by the fact that the r.m.s .",
    "of the pixel values ( away from zero ) is reduced from @xmath48 to @xmath49 in the region to be compared with bicep2 .",
    "the removal of the plane was sufficient to obviate the need to remove the @xmath47 modes .    for map iii , we reduced the ringing even further . to do this",
    ", we selected a mask the size of the entire bicep2 region .",
    "however , in this case , we could more closely mimic the bicep2 analysis by desplining first , before sending the map to healpix .",
    "this technique continued to reduce the ringing noise level , leaving a standard deviation from zero of @xmath50 .",
    "note that for these last three maps , we used the fortran 90 healpix implementation , which facilitates use of masks .",
    "this map is shown in fig .",
    "[ dustblrgmask ] .    for map",
    "iv , we took our desplined map from map iii , but applied the bicep2 sensitivity map as the mask during the healpix analysis . on the back end we corrected for this by dividing back off by the mask to flatten the image , just as we did for the actual bicep2 data",
    "this gives a standard deviation from zero of @xmath51 .",
    "we show this map in fig .",
    "[ dustbsensmask ] .    for map v , we did the most aggressive masking .",
    "we took our desplined map from map iii , and masked down to just the region of analysis ( @xmath40 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "this `` what - you - see - is - what - you - get '' or `` wysiwyg '' map has no influence from fitting the sky beyond the region we will actually analyze statistically .",
    "this gives a standard deviation from zero of @xmath53 .",

    "the properties of the genus are well - known in three dimensions ( 3d ) ( gott  1986 , hamilton  1986 , gott  1987 ) , but require some explanation in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case ( melott  1989 ) , particularly in the case of the sphere ( coles & plionis 1991 , gott  1990 ) .",
    "we can rigorously define the 2d genus on a spherical surface ( e.g. , colley  2003 ) .",
    "the 2d genus is defined to be equal to minus the 3d genus of solid objects formed by bestowing the regions above a threshold with a small , but finite radial extent .",
    "imagine using lead paint to paint the hot regions onto the surface of a balloon , and after letting the paint dry , bursting the balloon to obtain solid , curved lead shapes that would have a certain 3d genus .",
    "take the minus of this number and that will be @xmath59 , as we will define it .",
    "one hot spot in the north polar region would have a 2d genus of + 1 ( one hot spot ) , because the hot spot cap is one isolated region .",
    "suppose the hot region covered all of the sphere except for a cold spot in the south polar region .",
    "the genus would still be + 1 , because this would look like a sugar bowl without any handles , which is also one isolated region in 3d .",

    "the genus on a plane is determined by the local turning that a truck would do driving around the temperature contour surface .",
    "circling a hot spot on a plane would require a total turning of @xmath60 .",
    "the gaussian random phase formula measures this local turning . circling a hot spot on",
    "the sphere involves a total turning of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the fraction of the sphere in the hot spot ( because the deficit produced by parallel transport on the sphere is equal to the enclosed area ) .",
    "dividing by @xmath60 , we may define the effective genus : @xmath63 where @xmath62 is the fraction of the area of the sphere in the hot spots . for a gaussian random phase field on the sphere",
    "@xmath64 because the gaussian random phase field behaves locally on the sphere just as it does on the plane to produce this particular contribution to the turning integral .",
    "the mercator projection we have chosen preserves the turning , and thus the genus .",
    "therefore , in comparing our genus curves to the random phase formula , we will use @xmath65 , as defined rigorously above ( cf .",
    ", colley  2003 ) .",
    "the bicep2 analysis region is a fairly thin strip of the southern sky within a fairly narrow range in declination ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , which particularly lends itself to the mercator projection ( in celestial coordinates ) shown in in fig  [ bicepbmerc ] . to compute the genus",

    "[ bicepgenus ] shows the 2d genus for the bicep2 data , for a large number of @xmath22 values .",

    "not surprisingly , for the full @xmath33 dust map , which looks nothing like a gaussian random phase field , the genus curve looks nothing like the gaussian random phase theoretical curve .",
    "however , the genus curve for the truncated @xmath33 map agrees very well with the gaussian random phase theoretical curve , although at lower amplitude than seen in the bicep2 genus curve .",
    "one supposes the bicep2 team wanted to show a map that would show just the modes where the gravity wave modes were most prominent .",
    "the bicep2 team filtered out the low @xmath34 modes to avoid confusion with the  from gravitational lensing , and presumably filtered out the low @xmath34 modes to avoid confusion with dust .",
    "this is because the power spectrum in the dust  is very flat . for dust @xmath70 .",
    "the flat nature of the power - spectrum for the dust is shown in flauger , hill & spergel ( 2014 ) .",

    "the bicep2 map has a choppier distribution than does the planck map .",
    "when flauger , hill , and spergel ( 2014 ) measure the @xmath68 for the gravity wave fit to the bicep2  power spectrum data ( @xmath78 ) they obtain 1.1 , the dust fit is worse at 1.7 but not horrible .",
    "the bicep2 data does follow closely the expected power spectrum for the gravity wave modes including the fact that @xmath79 in the modes at @xmath80 is lower than at @xmath81 as expected from gravity waves rather than higher as would be expected for dust  only .",
    "the errors in the individual @xmath34 modes are enough to make the flatter dust distribution not look all that bad , its amplitude can be fit to give the right level and then it is simply a bit too high at the low @xmath34 end and a bit low at the high @xmath34 end .",
    "this is particularly true when one is also looking at the bump at the high @xmath34 end where the gravity wave signal is flatter as well .",
    "the amplitude of the genus curve can be very useful in checking the power spectrum of the cosmological model as has been shown by park & kim ( 2010 ) and gott et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for 3d topology .",
    "the fact that flauger , hill , and spergel get a better fit for the steep gravity wave power spectrum than for the flatter dust spectrum , means that the filtered map that bicep2 has is in agreement with the number of structures expected from the steep gravity wave spectrum .",
    "this is shown by the fact that the bicep2 team has also included a simulation with  produced by gravitational lensing only .",
    "the power spectrum from gravitational lensing over the range @xmath76 also has @xmath72 so that @xmath82 , it just has an amplitude that is too low to explain the bicep2 data as they demonstrate .",
    "the gravitational lensing map bicep2 shows for comparison has a similar number of structures , and a similar amplitude of the genus ( it just has lower contrast . ) since the dust spectrum is flatter ( and by the way is a poorer fit to the power spectrum ) it should predict fewer structures than bicep2 observes .",
    "the genus curve amplitude just provides a more dramatic illustration of this poorer fit .",
    "the bicep2 _ b _ genus curve shows a maximum of 22 red spots and 22 blue spots .",
    "the identically filtered planck map showed only a maximum of 18 red spots and 18 blue spots ( fig .",

    "[ dustbmerc ] , [ dustblrgmask ] and [ dustbsensmask ] , the full @xmath33 map shows a highly non - gaussian distribution ( fig .",

    ", the bicep2-like processing of the data appears to mask many non - gaussianities in the dust - dominated planck map .",
    "kamionkowski & kovetz ( 2014 ) have suggested using the hexadecapolar departure from isotropy to reveal the level of non - gaussianity in the  data introduced by foregrounds , but conclude the current signal - to - noise is insufficient for conclusive results .",
    "if @xmath18 and all the  seen in the bicep2 map are produced by dust , and planck is detecting dust modes with ( @xmath0 ) at high signal - to - noise then we would expect the two maps ( fig .",
    "[ bicepbmerc ] and fig .",
    "[ dustbsensmask ] ) to have the same number of structures in the same locations .",
    "visual inspection confirms the genus result that there are indeed fewer structures in the planck map . if planck is detecting the dust modes this suggests that a number structures in the bicep2 map must be due to gravity waves .",
    "the 353 ghz map itself , of course , contains more information than contained in the power spectrum or the histogram or genus curve .",
    "we can ask for the correlation coefficient between the two maps .",
    "it is 15.2% ( average for maps i  v ) showing that the location of the structures are mostly uncorrelated  as is apparent from a visual inspection .",
    "the  that bicep2 is seeing are not the ones we are seeing in the planck 353 ghz map .",

    "the  due to gravity waves also have @xmath85 at low @xmath34 but are of lower amplitude .",
    "this simulated map has a similar number of structures ( consistent with what we would expect from the genus statistic ) , but its amplitude is too small to fit the bicep2 data .",
    "this aspect of their study has not been questioned .",
    "in addition bicep2 at smaller scales sees the gravitational lensing .",
    "the gravity wave modes kick in for @xmath86 with higher amplitude in the  power spectra , over and above the gravitational lensing .",
    "so it seems clear that bicep2 is not seeing just gravitational lensing .    at this point",

    "now the galactic foreground faraday rotation in the bicep2 region is fairly uniform at about @xmath91 ( opperman  2011 ) . at 150 ghz , @xmath92 , so the faraday rotation is 0.0004 rad , far less than the required 0.1 radian .",
    "the additional faraday rotation seen in quasars amounts to only an additional @xmath93 due to intervening clouds .",

    "flauger , hill and spergel ( 2014 ) have stated that the polarized amplitude is sufficiently uncertain that the results are either consistent with a  signal from bicep2 due to @xmath10 and gravity waves or @xmath18 and due to dust .",
    "we have not depended on the amplitude at all but have only gone on the structure of the 353 ghz modes , which do not match the visual appearance nor the amplitude of the genus curve in the bicep2 data . if the structures seen in the bicep2 map could readily identified with structures in the 353 ghz planck map this would be a smoking gun implicating the dust .",
    "this is definitely not seen .",
    "now let us look at the amplitude for the first time .",
    "our histogram shows the amplitude of the  amplitude in the ( spline subtracted ) filtered @xmath0 bicep2 map to be @xmath94 ( @xmath2 ) at 150 ghz .",
    "the histogram of the  amplitudes in the 353 ghz map iv from planck which we have constructed from their _ q _ and _ u _ maps show the ( spline subtracted ) filtered @xmath95  amplitude to be @xmath51 , again in brightness temperature .",
    "we have measured the power spectrum of our whole sky  dust map at 353 ghz ; it follows the simple power law form found by planck and is at a higher amplitude than their 80% of the sky map which avoids the galactic plane . to compare with that 80% map",
    ", we have cleaned the planck map of the 20% of the sky that includes the plane and we get the same amplitude power spectrum that the planck team reports ( boulanger  2014 ) .",
    "this makes it clear that the scale in the planck _",
    "q _ and _ u _ maps is in units of k in brightness temperature , which is what we have adopted .",
    "the planck collaboration estimates that the dust  power spectrum should be lowered by a factor of @xmath96 at 143 ghz relative to that at 353 ghz .",
    "we have taken this value from a power spectrum estimate for 143 ghz they have made publicly available .",
    "that implies they expect the amplitude of the dust signal at 143 ghz relative to 353 ghz to be lower by a factor of 25.8 .",
    "if dust emission goes as @xmath97 over that frequency range and the polarization fraction stays constant between 143 ghz and 353 ghz , then the amplitude of the dust map at 143 ghz should be lower ( in brightness temperature ) than that in the 353 ghz map by a factor of @xmath98 ^ 2 \\left[{{353}\\over{143}}\\right]^{\\gamma-4 } = 25.8,\\ ] ] where for the microwave background , @xmath99 at 56.8 ghz .",
    "this implies a value of @xmath100 over the frequency range from 143 ghz to 353 ghz which is plausible .",
    "if we use that value we can calculate using the same formula the lowering we expect from 353 ghz to 150 ghz .",
    "we find a factor of 23.1 , ( quite reasonable since we are moving over a slightly smaller frequency range ) .",
    "probably the best estimate of this factor is from the recent planck data ( planck collaboration 2014a ) on polarization as a function of frequency .",
    "they estimate that the polarized dust emission @xmath101 $ ] , where @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for high latitude dust .",
    "( thus @xmath104 .",
    ") this includes the fact that the polarized fraction is slightly lower at 150 ghz than at 353 ghz .",
    "this is consistent with draine and hensley s ( 2013 ) treatment of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in interstellar dust . for inclusions ,",
    "magnetic dipole emission is expected to be polarized orthogonally relative to the normal electric dipole radiation .",
    "this can explain a somewhat smaller polarization fraction at 150 ghz than at 353 ghz .",
    "the factor @xmath105 is derived empirically by the planck team .",
    "we find that for polarized emission @xmath106 converting fluctuations in intensity to fluctuations in brightness temperature in the cmb using @xmath107 = { { 2\\pi h\\nu^3c^{-2}e^{h\\nu / kt}}\\over{(e^{h\\nu / kt } - 1)^2}}(h\\nu / kt^2)dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 , we find for polarized dust emission : @xmath109^{-4}\\left[{{e^{150/56.8}}\\over{e^{353/56.8}}}\\right ] \\left[{{e^{353/56.8 } - 1}\\over{e^{150/56.8 } - 1}}\\right]^2\\\\   = 21.3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we will adopt .",
    "this is quite similar to the original planck derived estimate of 23.1 mentioned above , but this is more accurate , based on later and more complete data .",
    "as we shall see later , the bicep2 map and the planck 353 ghz map have a correlation of only 15.2% .",
    "if we attributed that to supposing that the dust signal at 150 ghz was 15.2% of the total bicep2 signal which we would believe was primarily due to gravity waves , we would be left with the untenable conclusion that the polarized dust emission in this particular region must fall off as we go from 353 ghz to 150 ghz by a factor of 11.1 _ more _ than we expect ( i.e. , a factor of [ @xmath110/0.152 $ ] ) .",
    "dust can have different polarization fractions at different frequencies due to grain properties , but this much lowering seems implausible .",
    "in addition the planck data shows evidence for a small change in polarization fraction from 150 ghz to 353 ghz and this has already been included .",
    "so if the planck 353 ghz map were a pure dust signal with little noise contamination , the scenario that the dust signal at 150 ghz was sub - dominant would not work .    can the fallen - off dust signal be equal to the bicep2 signal ?",
    "against that simple interpretation ( that the bicep2 signal is a pure high signal - to - noise dust signal which can be seen in the 353 ghz map ) is the fact that the observed bicep2 pattern does not match the planck 353 ghz pattern .    by the way , we expect the bicep2 @xmath111 mode signal if it is cosmological and due to gravity waves , to have the same amplitude in brightness temperature at 353 ghz as it does at 150 ghz : @xmath94 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , under no circumstance do we expect the gravity wave signal to significantly pollute the planck signal of @xmath51 ( @xmath2 ) at 353 ghz .",
    "by contrast we may expect the dust emission at 353 ghz to pollute the bicep2 signal at 150 ghz to some extent .",
    "indeed this seems to be the case .",
    "we do find a correlation coefficient of 0.181 between the filtered bicep2 map and the similarly filtered 353 ghz map from planck ( map iv , shown in fig .  [ dustbsensmask ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the dust is peeking through in both maps ( the correlation is positive ) .",
    "we now consider the uncertainties associated with the correlation coefficients @xmath112 . to this end , for each map , we computed the correlations between not only the dust map and the bicep2 map , but also between the vertically and/or horizontally flipped dust map and the bicep2 map .",
    "this gave us 3 fairly independent measures for the level of correlation one might expect if there were no dust contamination .",
    "we went one step further , which was to conduct exactly the same experiment using maps constructed from the sky at the opposite galactic longitude , where there appears to be very similar structure in fig .",
    "[ dusttruncwholesky ] to that in the bicep2 region .",
    "each of the four available flips should be uncorrelated with the bicep2 map .",
    "this gives us 7 presumably uncorrelated maps to evaluate for each of our map methods . with our 5 methods",
    ", we now have 35 values from which to form an estimate of the typical variation in the correlation .",
    "the standard deviation for all 35 is @xmath113 .",
    "this is consistent with the variation seen in the last 4 maps ( maps ii ",
    "v , where the impact of the plane has been reduced one way or the other ) .",
    "we therefore regard this to be a reasonable errorbar on each of our correlation results .",
    "if we simply take the mean of the 5 correlation values , we have @xmath114 , which is more than three standard deviations away from zero .",
    "we therefore regard the correlation to be significantly detected .",
    "let us consider the possibility that the planck signal in the ( @xmath95 ) modes is significantly polluted by noise and/or systematic effects .",
    "if the planck map were all noise , how would one explain the correlation with bicep2 ? but some noise contamination of the planck @xmath0 map could help explain why its genus curve and histogram approximate the gaussian random phase results as well as they do .",
    "now we will analyze the situation in detail .",
    "we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the standard deviation in the bicep2 map , @xmath117 is the standard deviation of the bicep2 gravity wave signal , @xmath118 is the standard deviation of the bicep2 noise , @xmath119 is the standard deviation of bicep2 gravitational lensing signal , and @xmath120 is the standard deviation of the bicep2 dust signal ( since all these are uncorrelated with each other , they add in quadrature to give @xmath121 for the whole map ) .",

    "one can see that the most significant features in the dust map ( one major red spot and one major blue spot ) are , in fact , correlated with the bicep2 map . to calculate the correlation coefficient @xmath112 between the planck and bicep2 maps ,",
    "we divide each map by its standard deviation , and then multiply the two maps and average over the pixels .",
    "the noise in the bicep2 and the noise in the planck are uncorrelated , and so their product averages to zero .",

    "furthermore , we can explore what value of the correlation would be necessary to drive the gravitational wave component , @xmath151 to zero in our maps ( see table  [ xyzrtable ] ) . for map",

    "we have similar terms for gravitational lensing modes and dust modes . in equation ( 8) the numerator on the right hand side",
    "is multiplied by a factor of @xmath186 while the denominator is multiplied by a factor of @xmath187 .",

    "our solutions for @xmath151 , @xmath141 , and @xmath152 remain unchanged as does our result for @xmath156 .",
    "thus , our results are not affected if the bicep2 map drops some some modes .    the planck team and",
    "the bicep2 team have agreed to a joint analysis of their data .",
    "the bicep2 team can `` observe '' the planck 353 map using their procedures which would involve dropping just the ( 2 ) modes .",
    "thus , their final `` planck map '' would have an amplitude of @xmath190 because the bicep2 analyzed planck map contains only the ( 1 ) modes .",

    "this very rough estimate from the planck power spectrum suggests @xmath205 , similar to @xmath179 , suggesting noise makes a significant contribution to the planck map .",
    "the planck team notes that to look for a gravity wave signal at @xmath206 will require subtraction of the dust signal .",

    "our correlation study allows us to quantify the dust contribution to the bicep2 signal , and we find it to be slightly less than the gravity wave signal .    in conclusion",
