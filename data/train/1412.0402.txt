    "from that perspective , can be viewed as an optimal control problem for a so - called ( non - symmetric ) interval matrix or linear parametric uncertainty system , along the lines of kharitonov s theorem .",
    "unfortunately the latter does not generalize easily to discrete - time systems @xcite .",
    "an interesting result when there is a single uncertain parameter is proposed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the author found no simple way to use this towards proving theorem 3 .",
    "[ [ accelerated - consensus ] ] accelerated consensus + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as mentioned in the introduction , our initial motivation was the study of consensus algorithms accelerated through `` local '' memories ; see @xcite which propose the scheme ( similar to ) and analyze the case @xmath86 .",
    "very recently @xcite has proposed a scheme with `` extrapolating '' step , similar to the case @xmath86 ( and to the nesterov method , see above ) but where the limited information known about the network is a bound on the total number of nodes , instead of on the extremal eigenvalues of @xmath5 .",
    "researchers have also considered accelerations based on different resources than local memory , for instance allowing _ periodically time - varying _",
    "gain @xmath27 in .",
    "optimal tuning rules for @xmath94 can then build on _ polynomial - based filtering _",
    "the optimal acceleration strategy of @xcite can also be viewed as an instance of this framework , provided one limits the algorithm to a finite number of chebyshev polynomials which are then applied periodically . in this latter context ,",
    "when @xmath23 can take all values in @xmath24 $ ] , it is easy to check that the memory - based strategy is faster than the optimal periodically time - varying one .",
    "however if more is known about the @xmath23 , then polynomial - based filtering is straightforward to adapt towards better speed - up . in the extreme case where @xmath5 has @xmath95 different eigenvalues whose values are exactly known , it is possible to construct a polynomial of order @xmath95 that achieves deadbeat convergence in @xmath95 steps .",
    "similar `` finite - time consensus '' strategies have been proposed and studied in e.g.  @xcite , with an interpretation of the resulting algorithms as gathering initial state information at a central node , computing its average and redistributing the average through the network .",
    "it seems not straightforward to compare the resources `` local memory '' and `` time - varying gain '' outside an applicational context .",
    "in particular a standard time - varying implementation requires a stronger type of synchronization among all the nodes , namely they must not only agree on the frequency of updates but also on which gain to apply at each step .",
    "this may or may not be restrictive .",
    "the nesterov method combines both memory and time - dependent step lengths .",

    "@xcite proposes an accelerated consensus version which directly connects with the `` gather - and - distribute '' strategy of @xcite , although with _ a priori _ more complex communication requirements : it requires each node to communicate a vector of several values at each time step .",

    "it seems not unreasonable to suspect that local memory can help disentangle these influences . yet",
    "theorem 3 says that if the network is poorly characterized , in the precise sense @xmath97 $ ] , then having more than one additional memory is not helpful .",
    "this somehow seems to say : taking into account the direct feedback loop from @xmath3 through its neighbors @xmath6 and directly back to @xmath3 does allow improved convergence ; but speculating about longer feedback loops does not pay off . + finally , let us emphasize that theorem 3 starts with a positive semidefinite self - adjoint matrix @xmath37 , which can be viewed as a diffusive operator , or in consensus as an undirected communication matrix .",
    "in contrast , the state matrix characterizing the accelerated system is not symmetric .",
    "hence it seems to introduce transport , or hidden directed communication ( effects ) , which is known to improve convergence speed in several contexts @xcite .",
    "this also implies that the acceleration of @xcite , exactly like markov chain liftings , can not be applied iteratively . i.e.  the new state matrix , characterizing the system that results from an acceleration according to @xcite , is not symmetric which precludes applying the technique of @xcite once more .",
