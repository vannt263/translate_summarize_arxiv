    "quantum routing ( or quantum state fusion @xcite ) is an essential protocol allowing for construction of complex quantum networks .",
    "in contrast to a classical router , the quantum router exploits quantum phenomena .",
    "thus for instance the multi - direction broadcasting ( sending multiple copies of the signal to all output ports ) known from classical routing is forbidden since it would contradict the no - cloning theorem . on the other hand , various quantum phenomena such as quantum superposition or entanglement can be used . in our recent paper , we have defined a set of requirements imposed on a fully functional quantum router @xcite .",
    "these requirements include capability of the router to split quantum signal depending on the instructions passed by the control qubit while keeping the signal qubit intact .",

    ", the authors have presented a proof that it is impossible to quantum sign quantum messages .",
    "although it is indeed impossible to implement ( non - arbitrated ) quantum signing of quantum messages , it is still possible to accomplish a closely related task  the quantum authentication of quantum messages . in case of signature protocols",
    "the message needs to be readable for everyone , in authentication schemes this condition is relaxed and only a trusted party is able to read the message .",
    "in contrast to signing , an authenticated message can be verified through a ( secret ) key shared between the issuer of the message and its intended recipient . as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite show , authenticated quantum messages must be encrypted , while no such requirement is imposed for classical messages .",
    "the above mentioned research sparked great interest of the scientific community .",
    "quantum signing of classical messages ( classical bits ) has been studied for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite . in 2013 , li  _ et al._explicitly showed @xcite that quantum signature of a quantum message ( qubits ) is possible in arbitrated schemes .",
    "they also showed that this fact does not contradict the impossibility of non - arbitrated quantum signing mentioned before @xcite .",
    "a number of protocols implementing this task have been derived so far @xcite .",
    "apart from quantum signing , attention was also focused on closely related protocols , such as quantum authentication of quantum messages  @xcite , quantum identification @xcite or fingerprinting  @xcite .",
    "the potential for future realistic deployment of quantum signature and authentication can be demonstrated on the basis of two recent experiments  @xcite .    since",
    "future quantum networks should be able to benefit from all aspects of quantum information , we will focus on protocols involving a genuine quantum message . a number of possible general approaches has been proposed in this matter .",
    "for instance , a complex multiparticle ghz entangled state distributed to the communicating parties can be used for message signing @xcite .",
    "its generation and distribution might , consequently , prove to be experimentally difficult .",
    "but other protocols using only bell states @xcite or separable states @xcite have been also derived . in these cases",
    "however , the sender has to have multiple copies of the quantum message .",
    "this might be problematic because in principle quantum information can not be perfectly copied .",
    "two alternative approaches have been proposed by barnum _",
    "et al . _",
    "these authors overcome the need for multiple copies of quantum message by inserting additional qubits into the data stream and subsequently perform authenticity verification based on syndrome measurement of a stabilizer purity test code .",
    "they have derived two schemes .",
    "the first one uses a distribution of entangled bell states , whereas the second only transmits separable states .",
    "there is , however , an inherent problem with the linear - optical implementation of these two schemes . in order to perform a general stabilizer purity test , all transmitted qubits have to be collectively processed by a complex multi - qubit quantum circuit .",
    "considering the probabilistic nature of linear - optical quantum gates , this procedure will be highly ineffective and would require additional resources in the form of ancillary photons so that individual quantum gates can be joined together @xcite .    in this section",
    "we propose a feasible quantum authentication protocol for quantum messages that does not rely on entanglement distribution , availability of multiple copies of the message or complex multi - qubit measurements and is , therefore , suitable for the platform of linear - optics . at the same time",
    ", our scheme is efficient in the sense that only @xmath15 photons ( each encoding 2 qubits ) are necessary to send a @xmath15-qubit long quantum message .",
    "the general idea behind our scheme is to use two degrees of freedom of light , i.e. , one degree of freedom for the message itself and another degree of freedom for a one - time quantum authentication key .",
    "if one can decouple the message from the one - time key , one can also attack the scheme by coupling a counterfeited message with a previously decoupled key .",
    "there are two possible solutions : ( i ) the key reflects the message ( in classical computing the value of an `` irreversible '' function of the message is used as a key ) , ( ii ) the message is encrypted in a way that allows only the recipient to verify its authenticity .",
    "the first solution , used for instance in @xcite , requires some information about the message that can not be provided assuming that no perfect copies of the message exist .",
    "therefore , we resort to the second approach .",
    "this approach , as proved in @xcite , requires sharing a secret key between communicating parties and some sort of encryption of the transmitted message . in our solution ,",
    "the degree of freedom encoding message or key qubit is chosen at random and this random choice has a similar purpose as message encryption in @xcite .",
    "our authentication protocol follows several steps : assume alice wishes to transmit a quantum message @xmath16 composed of @xmath15 independent qubits @xmath17 .",
    "these qubits are stored in polarization - encoded states of single photons @xmath18 .",
    "her goal is to transmit this message to bob using a quantum authentication protocol so that bob can be sure of its authenticity .",
    "* step 1 : * bob and alice establish a standard quantum cryptography communication channel such as bb84 or r04 . using this channel , bob sends two encrypted strings @xmath19 and @xmath20 of classical information each @xmath15-bit long ( referred to as first and second `` salt '' string ) .",
    "this approach is inspired by assis _ at al .",
    "alice generates a random one - time key @xmath21 composed of @xmath15 polarization - encoded qubits @xmath22 .",
    "she uses the first salt string @xmath19 to establish the state preparation basis .",
    "if the corresponding bit equals 0 , she randomly prepares either diagonal @xmath23 or anti - diagonal @xmath24 polarization states .",
    " horizontal polarization state , @xmath25  vertical polarization state , @xmath26  diagonal polarization state , @xmath27  anti - diagonal polarization state , @xmath28  right circular polarization state , @xmath29  left circular polarization state . ]",
    "if the salt bit equals 1 , she randomly chooses right ( @xmath30 ) or left ( @xmath31 ) circular polarization states .",
    "* step 2 : * alice takes first qubit of the message ( @xmath17 ) and the first qubit of the key ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "these two qubits are subsequently inserted into a quantum router .",
    "the router encodes the control qubit into the spatial mode of a signal photon while preserving the message in its polarization state . for reference",
    "see @xcite . if the first bit of bob s second salt string @xmath20 is 0 , then @xmath17 serves as signal information and @xmath22 is the control qubit .",
    "then , the router output state becomes @xmath32,\\ ] ] where the @xmath33 sign depends on alice s choice and the value of @xmath34 corresponds to the value of the relevant bit in the first salt string . on the other hand ,",
    "if the first qubit of bob s second salt is 1 , then the roles of @xmath17 and @xmath22 are reversed ( @xmath22 becomes signal and @xmath17 becomes control ) .",
    "this swap leads to the output state @xmath35.\\ ] ] alice then sends the output qubit encoded both in polarization and spatial mode to bob .    *",
    "step 3 : * bob receives the photon from alice and , depending on the value of his second salt string @xmath20 bit , he either performs an encoding swap or not .",
    "this is a simple encoding swap operation that transforms ( [ eq : sign_1 ] ) into ( [ eq : sign_0 ] ) and vice versa .",
    "subsequently , bob subjects the photon to the decoupling procedure described in section  [ ref : qr ] .",
    "as demonstrated in that section , bob obtains the message qubit from the ancillary output port of the decoupling device while he simultaneously performs a projection measurement either on @xmath23 and @xmath24 or @xmath30 and @xmath31 polarizations in key output port depending on the value of the respective bit of the first salt string @xmath19 .",
    "* step 4 : * after bob s successful detection , he asks alice to publish her choice of key state @xmath22 using a quantum authenticated classical channel and compares that to his measurement outcome .",
    "all subsequent message qubits are transmitted in the same way .",
    "it is imperative that alice uses her authentication key @xmath21 only once .",
    "note that the above mentioned protocol can be implemented even without a quantum router .",
    "one can send the key and message qubits separately . because the second salt string is used ,",
    "the order in which they are sent is randomized . on the other hand , the quantum router permits the encoding of both qubits into one physical photon , making the transmission more effective . to demonstrate this effect ,",
    "consider a transmission line with transmissivity @xmath36 .",
    "a state of two consecutive photons is then transformed according to @xmath37 where @xmath22 and @xmath17 denote key and message qubits stored in individual photons . since the protocol succeeds only if both the photons reach bob s end , we have post - selected only this case .",
    "it occurs with success probability of @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one uses the router and thus encodes the information into both polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of one single photon , the state can be expressed in the form of ( [ eq : sign_0 ] ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us consider the key qubit being in the state @xmath23 and being encoded into the spatial mode .",
    "the transformation of this state imposed by the lossy channel now reads @xmath39 it follows from this equation that the success probability ( the probability of successful transport ) is now @xmath40 which is a significant improvement over the non - router based strategy especially for small channel transmissivities .",
    "let us begin our analysis by considering that eve has no _ a priori _ information about the message sent by alice to bob .",
    "if eve attempts to falsify it ( replace it with her own message ) , she has to guess which of the two possibilities ( [ eq : sign_0 ] ) or ( [ eq : sign_1 ] ) has been selected ( because she does not know the salt string ) .",
    "if she guesses correctly ( in half of the cases ) , she can falsify the message qubit .",
    "if she guesses incorrectly , she will mistakenly use the message @xmath17 as the key . in this case , there is a @xmath41 possibility that bob will detect an error ( assuming the message is random ) .",
    "therefore , eve trying to falsify the information introduces an inherent error rate @xmath42 . for @xmath15 number of message qubits , the probability of eve managing to counterfeit @xmath15 qubits and",
    "not be detected is given by @xmath43 for example , if @xmath15 equals 10 it is about 6% . for @xmath15",
    "equal to 20 , it would be as low as 0.3% .",
    "a problem can arise when the message is too short , or if eve only tries to counterfeit a small fraction of the message . to resolve this issue",
    "alice and bob can introduce decoy states . as a decoy state alice sends an orthogonal state to the current key state instead of the real message qubit .",
    "after bob receives this state , she informs him that it was a decoy and bob performs verification measurement . in this case even if eve guesses correctly the salt string , there is a @xmath41 probability that bob will detect an error by measuring polarization of the message qubit replaced by eve with falsified data .",
    "the overall probability of successful counterfeiting @xmath44 qubits from a @xmath45-qubit string is now given as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of randomly inserted decoy states and @xmath48 is the number of decoy states attacked .",
    "all qubits are successfully counterfeited with probability @xmath49 .",
    "this probability drops rapidly with the length of the transmitted string .",
    "it is also useful to investigate the average conditional fidelity of the transmitted chain of qubits , where the condition is successful authentication .",
    "let us therefore consider an @xmath15-qubit long message with the addition of @xmath47 decoy qubits , where @xmath50 qubits are altered by eve using the above described strategy .",
    "the unaltered qubits are transmitted with fidelity equal to @xmath51 while the counterfeited ones are transmitted with an average fidelity of @xmath41 ( random states ) . as a result",
    "the fidelity of the transmission is given by @xmath52 and with probability @xmath53 this transmission passes authenticity verification .",
    "eve can attack an arbitrary number of qubits @xmath44 while successfully attaching @xmath48 decoy states .",
    "thus , the scheme works on average with the mean fidelity @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a function describing the probability of eve attacking @xmath44 qubits ( for the sake of simplicity we assume that @xmath56 , i.e. , uniform distribution ) , @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 $ ] , and @xmath59 let us also define the average probability of counterfeiting as @xmath60 an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sign : eta ] ) reveals that for the limit of long messages ( @xmath61 ) , the value of @xmath62 becomes zero and the average fidelity reaches asymptotically the value of 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fnd ] ) .",
    "note , that by adding sufficient number of decoy states to the transmitted qubit stream one can asymptotically achieve @xmath63 .",
    "this is because , for a large number of decoy states @xmath64 , it is more likely for decoy states to be attacked rather than the states forming the message [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pc ] ) while ignoring the @xmath65 factor ] . in other words , for large values of @xmath47 it is very likely that @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the majority of errors will be found in the decoy states .",
    "secondly , for a large number of decoy states @xmath47 , the probability of successful counterfeiting [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pc ] ) while ignoring the probability of eve attacking @xmath48 decoy states and @xmath67 message qubits ] is significant only if @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the mean over @xmath44 is negligible .",

    "the fidelity is averaged over all possible cases of successful counterfeiting of extended message which includes attacks on @xmath51 to @xmath70 qubits.,width=302 ]     ( color online ) same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnd ] but for the average counterfeiting probability @xmath71 given by eq  ( [ eq : pca]).,width=302 ]    so far we have worked under the assumption that eve is unfamiliar with the content of the transmitted message .",
    "let us now extend our analysis and assume that eve managed to acquire complete information about the message and wishes to counterfeit it .",
    "note that , since we are not dealing with cryptography but with authentication , the message itself is not a secret .",
    "eve s strategy now consists of decoupling the message @xmath17 from the key @xmath22 qubits . at the time eve",
    "still does not know the salt string , and so is unable to tell which qubit is the message and which is the key .",
    "she then picks one of the qubits at random and performs a projective measurement @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a qubit state orthogonal to @xmath17 .",
    "whenever this projection measurement yields the value of @xmath74 , eve discards the entire operation and the lost photons would appear to bob as mere technological losses .",
    "there is a @xmath41 probability that eve correctly picked the message qubit and subjected it to the projection measurement . in this case",
    "the measurement outcome is always @xmath75 and eve uses the remaining key qubit to authenticate a forged message qubit .",
    "when this happens , bob does not register any errors ( @xmath76 ) . on the other hand , there is a @xmath41 probability that eve incorrectly picked the key qubit and subjected it to the projection measurement .",
    "since there is no correlation between the key and message qubits , the measurement outcome would yield @xmath75 or @xmath74 with balanced probabilities . considering that",
    "outcomes @xmath74 are discarded , the overall probability of eve sending an incorrect key is reduced by two . assuming that , similarly to the previous analysis , bob detects the incorrect key in half of the cases , the error rate introduced by eve s wrong choice is @xmath42 . in total , the average error rate ( considering both good and bad guesses ) introduced by eve using this strategy is @xmath77 and the probability of successfully counterfeiting @xmath15-qubit long message without being detected reads @xmath78 again , alice can insert decoy qubits at random to arbitrarily decrease eve s chances of undetected counterfeiting to @xmath79 at the expense of lowering the transmission rate .",
    "the average fidelity in this scenario can be similarly analyzed .",
    "the result would not differ quantitatively from the ones in the preceding paragraph .",
    "also note that eve can adopt a strategy that is more complex than simple projection ( [ eq : sign : proj ] ) , but the analysis of this possibility is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , for any individual attack strategy all the transmitted qubits can be attacked successfully with probability @xmath80 proportional to @xmath81 for @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the probability of keeping a decoy state unaltered .",
    "this means that the malicious behavior is possible only if eve knows the location of all the decoy states .",
    "the security of this protocol depends on the symmetry between key and message qubits .",
    "eve s inability to decide which qubits belong to the key and which are the message makes it impossible for her to affect one without affecting the other .",
    "the message is not secret .",
    "however , if eve tries to read it she will introduce errors in the key as well .",
    "a similar situation occurs when eve decides to undertake a hostile action to discredit alice by adding noise to her message without actually having any information about its content . in this scenario , eve malevolently changes the message by applying a random transformation unknown to alice or bob while the message itself is not known to eve . here",
    "we demonstrate that such action can be detected by bob if he analyzes the key .",
    "each of the qubits is assumed to be attacked independently .",
    "even though we restrict our analysis to individual attacks , it is likely that the results hold even for collective attacks , since the message qubits are not correlated .",
    "eve does not know if the message is represented by a spatial degree of freedom or the polarization state of a photon . in order to alter the message",
    "only , eve has to guess the way in which its qubits are encoded .",
    "if she guesses correctly she will not be detected when changing the attacked qubit .",
    "she can choose to attack the spatial degree of freedom by tampering with one rail only , or she can attack the polarization degree of freedom by applying the same optical transformation in both rails .",
    "both these strategies are equivalent .",
    "this is because eve can not always alter a message qubit @xmath17 without being detected .",
    "if she attempts to change the qubit then , with probability @xmath84 , she will alter a key qubit @xmath22 instead .",
    "any single - qubit operation performed by eve can be generated by pauli s matrices @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "thus , if @xmath87 for each @xmath15 , an error can be detected at the last step of the protocol revealing eve s presence .",
    "the key qubit is given as @xmath88 one can show that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is kronecker s delta .",
    "alice alters the value of @xmath91 at random .",
    "this means that if eve decides to perform @xmath92 or @xmath93 operation , her action will be detected with probability @xmath94 .",
    "however , in case of @xmath95 she will introduce errors with probability @xmath84 .",
    "hence , an eavesdropper can not manipulate an individual message qubit without introducing errors that can be detected at the last step of the protocol .",
    "note that there is some asymmetry between the @xmath96-plane and the @xmath97 direction .",
    "this asymmetry could be removed by using all six eigenstates of pauli s matrices as possible key qubits . however , as we have shown above , this is not necessary .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates the rationale behind using two sets of eigenstates of either @xmath92 or @xmath93 as potential key qubits .",
    "if we decided to use only one basis , e.g. , @xmath98 , those operations that can be described as rotations around the @xmath91-axis would not be detected .",
    "this would leave bob unaware of eve tampering with the quantum message .",
    "another possible way around it would be to force alice to send only eigenstates of @xmath92 operator as a message .",
    "however , this would make the message classical and the protocol would be secure only with classical information .    according to the analysis presented in this subsection",
    ", eve causes authentication errors if she tries to malevolently forge the transmitted message even without actually knowing it or replacing it by her own message .",
    "therefore , average fidelity can be calculated on the same premises , and with the same results as in eq .",

    "it consists of a bell state splitter and a set of four single - photon detectors . in the first step , we separate the states @xmath106 from @xmath107 by combining the two output modes on a polarizing beam splitter ( transmitting horizontal and reflecting vertical polarization ) .",
    "if the signal and control qubits of the router were in one of the @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) states , the photon from output of the router travels to the upper ( lower ) mode of the first pdbs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bell : disc ] .",
    "hence , the combined transformation of the router followed by bell splitting reads    @xmath108 , full bell state discrimination is performed by detecting a photon by one of the four detectors which corresponds to a projection in bell s basis .      in this subsection",
    "we explain how a quantum router can be used to perform arbitrary operations in bell s basis .",
    "in contrast to bell state discrimination , quantum state manipulation does not project the quantum state on one of the bell states and , thus , maintains coherence .",
    "this task can not be performed ( at least not without restrictions ) with just one controlled - phase gate .",
    "the controlled - phase gate transforms bell states into separable mutually orthogonal two - photon states .",
    "these states remain correlated .",
    "it is , for instance , impossible to filter out just one of them from a two - photon state by applying local polarization - sensitive attenuation because a pair of states would be affected .",
    "we have already described the principles behind router - assisted decomposition of a quantum state into bell states . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bell : manip ] , the set of four detectors can be replaced by a set of four neutral density filters and phase shifters .",
    "the parameters of these filters and phase shifters can be set independently .",
    "hence , after applying inverse of the bell splitter depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bell : disc ] followed by the quantum decoupler we can implement an arbitrary transformation    @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 are independent amplitude transmittances and phase shifts , respectively . note that this procedure allows any two - qubit state in bell basis to be directly engineered without disturbing its coherence . using the above - described components one can implement an arbitrary positive valued measurement in the bell s basis .",
    "this is especially interesting for investigating nonlinear properties of quantum states @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the properties of quantum routers and their corresponding inverse devices  quantum decouplers .",
    "we have demonstrated how quantum routers can be used to implement prominent quantum information protocols on two examples : a quantum authentication procedure for the authentication of quantum messages , and the use of a quantum router for non - destructive complete bell state manipulation .",
    "both of these examples demonstrate that quantum routers should not be reduced to quantum analogues of classical routers , but rather considered to be important and versatile components of future quantum networks . the recent experimental demonstration of a linear - optical quantum router @xcite makes the theoretical concept of quantum routing experimentally feasible .",
    "this paper proposes viable options , which should be considered when dealing with practical quantum authentication or non - destructive bell state manipulation .",
