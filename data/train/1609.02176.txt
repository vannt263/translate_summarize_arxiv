    "typically , an electronic system sustains average charge and heat current densities , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , when subjected to a uniform temperature gradient , @xmath8 , and constant electric field , @xmath9 .",
    "its linear thermoelectric response is described by [ eq : linres ] (    c j^e + j^h +    ) = (    cc & + & +    ) (    c + -t +    ) , where @xmath10 is the conductivity tensor , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the peltier tensors , and @xmath13 is the thermal conductivity tensor . in noninteracting systems , the electrical and heat - current operators are simply related to each other , giving rise to relations between @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "these relations continue to hold in fermi liquids , up to asymptotically vanishing corrections .",
    "an example is the wiedemann - franz law , @xmath14 , ( we use throughout @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the electron charge ) , whose breakdown has been interpreted as a signature of physics beyond the fermi liquid framework @xcite .",
    "another is the exact relation for noninteracting electrons @xcite between @xmath11 at a given temperature @xmath17 and chemical potential @xmath18 , and @xmath10 of the same system at zero temperature and shifted chemical potential [ eq : mott ] ( t , ) = _ - ^ d ( t=0,+ ) , where @xmath19 is the fermi function .",
    "this formula hence implies that in the absence of interactions , @xmath11 shares the same symmetry properties as @xmath10 .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by solving the boltzmann equation within an energy - dependent relaxation - time approximation @xcite .",
    "owing to the pioneering works of onsager @xcite and subsequently of kubo @xcite it is well known that various linear - response transport coefficients are related via the time reversal symmetry of microscopic dynamics .",
    "consequently , one finds on general grounds that in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . in turn , it is straightforward to show that even for an anisotropic system , as long as it is invariant under reflections , say with respect to the @xmath24 axis , @xmath25 .",
    "the above discussion implies that under similar conditions one also finds @xmath26 , provided that the system is noninteracting or considered within approximated boltzmann transport theory .",
    "a natural question then arises : is the relation @xmath26 valid beyond the limits of these two conditions ? beside its intrinsic theoretical appeal , this issue is also important for identifying non - fermi liquid behavior in the thermoelectric properties of correlated electronic systems .",
    "one such property is the nernst signal , defined by the off - diagonal elements @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the thermopower tensor @xmath29 .",
    "the latter relates the measured electric field to an applied temperature gradient , @xmath30 , in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath31 and in the absence of an electrical current .",
    "the dependence of @xmath32 on both the resistivity tensor @xmath33 and @xmath11 means that generally @xmath34 only for isotropic systems .",
    "therefore , the symmetry properties of @xmath32 do not carry direct information about interaction effects without independent knowledge of @xmath35 .",
    "however , such information may be gleaned from discrepancies between the measured nernst signal and the predictions of boltzmann transport theory .",
    "while this theory accounts for the observed data in a number of materials @xcite it underestimates the effect by orders of magnitude in several quasi - one - dimensional conductors @xcite .",
    "the nernst effect is also a sensitive probe of superconducting fluctuations , which contribute positively to the signal @xcite , in contrast to quasiparticles of various ordered normal states whose contribution is often of a negative sign @xcite .",
    "a positive nernst effect has been measured over a wide range above the critical temperature , @xmath36 , in a series of superconductors including the cuprates @xcite , as well as amorphous films of nb@xmath37si@xmath38 and ino@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "while the fluctuation contribution in the cuprates emerges from a high - temperature negative quasiparticle signal , the latter dominates the nernst effect down to , and even below , @xmath36 in other compounds such as the pnictides @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the interplay between these opposing contributions in systems which exhibit concomitant strong fluctuations towards competing orders including superconductivity .    motivated by the aforementioned issues we study in sec . [",
    "sec : alpha ] the symmetry properties of @xmath11 within a generic model of interacting electrons .",
    "we begin by considering the thermoelectric linear response using the kubo formula .",
    "we show that the close relation which exists between the electrical and heat current operators in the noninteracting limit naturally leads , in the presence of reflection symmetry , to @xmath26 .",
    "however , contrary to the corresponding relation for the hall conductivities the property @xmath26 is not protected by reflection and time - reversal symmetries , and we demonstrate its explicit violation in the exactly solvable problem of two harmonically interacting electrons in a magnetic field . having established this point of principle we move on to consider the issue using boltzmann transport theory for the interacting system .",
    "we show that @xmath26 is obtained within the relaxation - time approximation of this theory , or more generally whenever inelastic processes can be neglected .",
    "since this is the case in a disordered fermi liquid at low temperatures we conclude that violation of the above relation under the specified conditions is a telltale sign of interactions beyond the fermi liquid framework . in sec . [",
    "sec : nernst ] we consider a non - fermi liquid model of weakly coupled luttinger chains in the presence of a spin gap .",
    "we show that the antisymmetry of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath11 is indeed violated .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the nernst signal and show that interactions can lead to its substantial enhancement in such low dimensional systems .",
    "this may bare relevance to understanding the large signal observed experimentally in the quasi - one - dimensional materials .",
    "finally , we also find that the sign of the effect in the spin gapped system changes from negative to positive as the temperature is lowered and the magnetic field increased .",
    "we interpret this behavior as being due to the stronger superconducting fluctuations induced by the spin gap .",
    "various technical aspects of our study are relegated to the appendices .",
    "we consider interacting spinless fermions in a two - dimensional system of area @xmath40 , which includes mass anisotropy and coupling to static electromagnetic potentials .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath41 , with [ eq:2dhdensity ] ( ) & = & ^-e ( ) ( ) + & & + d^2r u(-)^()( ) ( ) , where @xmath42 , summation over repeated greek indices , which take the values @xmath43 , is implied , and the interaction is assumed to obey @xmath44 .",
    "a route for calculating the thermoelectric coefficients was laid out by luttinger @xcite , who argued that in the long - wavelength , low - frequency limit the linear response to a temperature variation @xmath45 is the same as the response to a fictitious gravitational field @xmath46 .",
    "an extension of luttinger s results to the case with a magnetic field was given by oji and streda @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field enters the calculation in two ways : first , it couples to the unperturbed density @xmath47 of @xmath48 , such that the latter reads @xmath49 .",
    "secondly , the unperturbed current density operators @xmath50 , @xmath51 are themselves modified , with @xmath50 becoming @xmath52 , see appendix [ app : currents ] . consequently , [ eq : kubo1 ] _ ij&= & + & & _",

    "ij^(2)=- d^2r j^e_i ( * r * ) r_j _ k = ^ijzm_z , where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 component of the orbital magnetization .",
    "the importance of this contribution and its origin in the redistribution of the equilibrium magnetization currents which flow in the system , has been extensively discussed by cooper , halperin and ruzin @xcite . here , we note that its appearance is a direct consequence of the kubo formalism .    whereas @xmath56 is clearly antisymmetric in @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the other contribution ( see appendix [ app : kubo ] ) [ eq : alpha1 ] _",
    "i j^(1)=_0 , expressed in terms of the retarded correlation function @xmath61 of the averaged electrical and heat current densities , is generally not .",
    "the transformation properties of the correlation functions are discussed in appendix [ app : timerev ] . under spatial reflection ,",
    "when such a transformation is a symmetry of the system , they imply that the diagonal elements of @xmath62 are even functions of the magnetic field @xmath63 , while the off - diagonal elements are odd .",
    "since also @xmath64 one finds that [ eq : refsymmalpha ] _",
    "ij(b ) = \\ {    cc _",
    "ij(-b ) & i =",
    "j + -_ij(-b ) & ij +    . , with similar relations for @xmath65 and @xmath13 .    concomitantly ,",
    "the transformation of @xmath62 under time reversal and the expressions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , eqs ( [ eq : alphatilde1],[eq : alphatilde2 ] ) , lead to the conclusion [ eq : timerevsymmalpha ] t_ij(b ) = _ ji(-b ) .",
    "hence , combining property ( [ eq : refsymmalpha ] ) , when applied to @xmath68 , with eq .",
    "( [ eq : timerevsymmalpha ] ) yields the relation @xmath69 between the off diagonal elements of the peltier tensors .",

    "this stands in contrast to @xmath10 ( and @xmath13 ) , whose elements are related by time reversal symmetry via @xmath21 , thereby implying @xmath25 for the hall conductivity of a reflection symmetric system .",
    "notwithstanding , noninteracting electrons constitute an exception to the above statement . for this case",
    "it is sufficient to consider the most general hamiltonian @xmath70 of a single particle , whose position operator we denote by @xmath71 . in first quantization , @xmath72 , where the curly brackets denote the anti - commutator . using the continuity equation , @xmath73 , to identify the energy current density @xmath74 , one finds for @xmath75 [ eq : jqni ] * j*^h=-\\{h-,*j*^e}. as a result , the correlation functions appearing in @xmath76 transform in the same way as the @xmath77 correlation functions determining @xmath10 .",

    "[ eq : timerevsymmalpha ] ) that @xmath79 .",
    "this , in turn , when combined with reflection symmetry , gives @xmath26 .",

    "let us note in passing that when @xmath80 the above discussion implies that for a generic interacting system with no reflection symmetry @xmath81 @xcite . in this case",
    "it is impossible to make @xmath5 purely diagonal by choosing suitably aligned principle axes .",
    "such an `` anomalous '' peltier effect is different from the hall conductivity under the same conditions , which can always be made to vanish , and is necessarily a consequence of interactions , since in their absence @xmath82 .",
    "we now proceed to demonstrate the explicit violation of @xmath26 in an exactly solvable example .",
    "consider two interacting particles in a magnetic field , whose hamiltonian [ eq:2ph ] h&=&h_0+u(_1-_2)=_i=1,2(m_x v_i , x^2+m_y v_i , y^2 ) + & & + m_x_x^2(x_1-x_2)^2+m_y_y^2(y_1-y_2)^2 , is reflection symmetric , but anisotropic due to the rotation asymmetry of the mass tensor and harmonic interaction .",

    "does not include a boundary potential , which is responsible for generating equilibrium edge currents and magnetization .",

    "<S> the electrical hall conductivities of any anisotropic interacting system with reflection symmetry obey @xmath0 . in contrast , we show that the analogous relation between the transverse thermoelectric peltier coefficients , @xmath1 , does not generally hold in the same system . </S>",
    "<S> this fact may be traced to interaction contributions to the heat current operator and the mixed nature of the thermoelectric response functions . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , however , it appears that emergence of quasiparticles at low temperatures forces @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that quasiparticle - free groundstates ( so - called non - fermi liquids ) may be detected by examining the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the presence of reflection symmetry and microscopic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions are based on the following results : ( i ) the relation between the peltier coefficients is exact for elastically scattered noninteracting particles ; ( ii ) it holds approximately within boltzmann theory for interacting particles when elastic scattering dominates over inelastic processes . in a disordered fermi liquid </S>",
    "<S> the latter lead to deviations that vanish as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) we calculate the thermoelectric response in a model of weakly - coupled spin - gapped luttinger liquids and obtain strong breakdown of antisymmetry between the off - diagonal components of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the nernst signal in this model is enhanced by interactions and can change sign as function of magnetic field and temperature . </S>"
