    "long suspected to be an important component of the interstellar medium , water has proven difficult to observe because of the dominating absorption by water vapor in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "water masers at radio frequencies are bright enough to penetrate the atmosphere , but they are rare and their physical conditions may be exceptional . now that we have flown a sensitive infrared spectrometer in space , aboard the _ infrared space observatory _ ( @xcite ) , transitions among energy levels @xmath41000 k above the ground state of h@xmath0o are observable .",
    "early results from _ iso _ indicate that h@xmath0o is a significant constituent in a cloud near the galactic center ( @xcite ) and that h@xmath0o is as abundant as co in shocked regions in orion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations reported here are part of a study of the infrared emission from supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "our targets were selected from a sample of supernova remnants with previous evidence for interaction with nearby molecular clouds based on x - ray and radio morphology ( @xcite ) , millimeter - wave molecular line observations ( @xcite ) , and oh 1720 mhz observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of 1720 mhz maser emission without bright main - line oh maser emission suggests that they are collisionally excited ( @xcite ) , and their location in bright radio remnants indicates that they are produced in the dense regions just behind molecular shocks .",
    "the first results of our _ iso _ observations showed that the [ o  i ] 63 @xmath5 m line , which is expected to be one of the brightest cooling lines for post - shock gas for a wide range of gas densities and shock velocities , is very bright at the locations of the oh masers ( @xcite ; paper i ) . in a parallel observational project",
    ", we also found shock - accelerated cs , co , and hco@xmath6 molecules in 3c  391 ( @xcite ) . in this paper , we present follow - up spectral observations to see which additional infrared lines are bright from molecular supernova shocks .",
    "these observations are the first detection of far - infrared h@xmath0o , oh , and co lines from supernova remnants .",
    "we report here far - infrared spectral observations of a single position in each of 3 supernova remnants : 3c  391 , w  44 , and w  28 .",
    "all observations reported here were performed with the _ iso _ long - wavelength spectrometer ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the medium - resolution grating to fully sample the wavelength range from 42.2188.6 @xmath5 m .",
    "the coordinates are based on bright oh 1720 mhz masers ( @xcite ) in each remnant ( for w  44 : 18@xmath756@xmath828.4@xmath9 + 01@xmath1029@xmath1159@xmath12 , for w  28 : 18@xmath701@xmath852.3@xmath9 -23@xmath1019@xmath1125@xmath12 ; b1950 ) ; for 3c  391 we shifted closer to the peak of shocked cs and co broad - molecular - line emission 3c  391:bml ( 18@xmath746@xmath847.1@xmath9 -01@xmath1000@xmath1151@xmath12 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lws beamsize is @xmath13 , and the spectra are severely affected by fringes , due to constructive and destructive interference ( inside the spectrometer ) of wavefronts from our structured , extended sources .",
    "we removed the fringes using the _ iso _ spectral analysis package , assuming that the emitting region is extended at all wavelengths .",
    "an important portion of the spectrum of 3c  391:bml , including the low - lying transition of ortho - h@xmath0o at 179.5 @xmath5 m , is shown in fig .",
    "[ lwspec ] .",
    "the continuum is due to dust from the supernova remnant ( some 30% of the total ) and unrelated interstellar material along the line of sight ( see paper i ) .",
    "in addition to the h@xmath0o and co lines indicated , there are some remaining ripples in the spectrum that do not fall at the wavelength of predicted lines nor do they have the shape expected for an unresolved spectral line . a second spectral observation toward 3c",
    "391:bml was performed in order to confirm some of the spectral lines , and to search for lines of h@xmath0o and oh from energy levels higher than we had already detected .",
    "the result for the oh ( @xmath14 ) line is shown in figure  [ ohspec ] .",
    "very bright lines from atomic and ionic c , n , and o , and weaker molecular lines were detected from all three supernova remnants",
    ". we will compile and present the complete line lists in a future paper .",
    "of the three sources that we observed , only 3c  391:bml had a rich spectrum of molecular emission . a list of h@xmath0o , oh , and co lines detected or limited toward 3c  391:bml is shown in table  [ linetab ] . for w  28 ,",
    "the co(16 - 15 ) and co(15 - 14 ) emission lines were detected , and for w  44 only the co(16 - 15 ) line was detected ; the co lines are a factor of 2 and 4 fainter for w  28 and w  44 compared to 3c  391:bml .",
    "the 95% confidence upper limit on the h@xmath0o(@xmath15-@xmath16 ) 179.5 @xmath5 m line for w  44 and w  28 is half the brightness of the line detected toward 3c  391:bml . considering that 3c  391 also had the brightest [ o  i ] 63 @xmath5 m line and dust continuum",
    ", it is possible that both w  28 and w  44 could have similar shock - excited spectra , with the h@xmath0o lines unfortunately just below our detection limit . while no oh emission was detected for w  28 and w  44 , the 119 @xmath5 m transition from the ground - state",
    "was detected in _ absorption _",
    ", presumably due to foreground gas .",
    "one source of uncertainty is the identification of the lines .",
    "although the resolving power of these observations was less than 300 , such that wavelengths can not be measured sufficiently accurately for conclusive identifications , our main conclusion  namely , that h@xmath0o , oh , and co were detected from shock - excited gas in supernova remnants  is strong . in the time - honored tradition of spectroscopy",

    "the most important emission line that is expected to be bright but is not detected is the 119 @xmath5 m line of oh .",

    "in order to determine the physical conditions that can produce the observed suite of spectral lines , and to measure the abundances of the observed species , we compared the line brightnesses to a simple model that balances collisional and radiative transitions within a uniform emitting region .",

    "the ratios of the @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 millimeter lines of cs are also sensitive to the gas density , suggesting @xmath74 @xmath3 , and the millimeter cs and co lines somewhat constrain the temperature , @xmath75 k ( @xcite ) . for the abundance calculations",
    ", we will assume @xmath76 @xmath3 and @xmath77 k , which is consistent with the presence and lack of other oh and h@xmath0o lines in the observed wavelength range .",
    "we determine the abundances of the various molecules assuming all lines arise from the same physical region , with constant temperature and density .",
    "the column density of oh is @xmath78 @xmath68 , and the optical depth of the 79 @xmath5 m line is of order unity .",
    "the co excitation is much more sensitive to temperature ; to match the brightness of the well - detected @xmath79 line , the co column density @xmath80 @xmath68 .",
    "the h@xmath0o lines are estimated to be optically thick : if we associate the line observed at 180.69 @xmath5 m with h@xmath30o ( @xmath15-@xmath45 ) , then the isotope ratio implies an optical depth @xmath1 for the brightest h@xmath0o line .",
    "however , in the low - density limit , @xmath81 @xmath3 , spontaneous decay is still faster than collisional de - excitation , and the line brightness still measures the h@xmath0o abundance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the column density of h@xmath0o from the excitation model is @xmath82 @xmath68 . to determine the absolute abundance of each species , we require a measure of the h@xmath0 column density .",
    "if we assume the emitting region is a uniform sphere with diameter equal to the observed angular size of shock - excited molecular gas ( @xmath83 from @xcite ) , and we take from the excitation model @xmath76 @xmath3 , we find @xmath84 @xmath3 .",
    "this value of @xmath85 agrees with the observed brightness ( from our _ iso _ sws observations , in preparation ) of the s(3 ) line of h@xmath0 , if @xmath86 . in summary",
    ", we estimate the relative abundances of co : oh : h@xmath0o to be 100:1:7 , and the abundance of water in the shocked cloud is [ h@xmath0o / h@xmath0]@xmath88 .",
    "the warm h@xmath0o in 3c  391:bml is likely due to shock - enhanced chemistry . in relatively hot gas ,",
    "oh is rapidly converted into h@xmath0o by the reaction @xmath89 , so that all the available o that is not already locked in co would be converted into h@xmath0o ( @xcite ) .",
    "models for the oxygen chemistry predict very efficient conversion of oh into h@xmath0o for non - dissociative shocks into high - density ( @xmath90  @xmath3 ) clouds but comparable oh and h@xmath0o column densities for shocks into intermediate - density ( @xmath91  @xmath3 ) clouds , while co and h@xmath0o are comparably abundant ( @xcite ) . behind a fully dissociative shock , the molecules re - form in a much cooler ( @xmath4500  k ) region ( @xcite ) . in cooler gas , the 1420  k barrier ( @xcite ) for the @xmath89 reaction can not be overcome , and oh is more abundant than h@xmath0o ( @xcite ) except deep inside dense molecular cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "the chemistry in cooler gas depends on photo - dissociation ; oh is much more abundant than h@xmath0o ( @xcite ) , except deep inside very dark cores , where the photodissociation rate is very low ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relative strengths of the h@xmath0o lines that we observe were calculated by kaufman & neufeld ( 1996 ) , and our observations are generally consistent with the models for pre - shock density @xmath92 @xmath3 . however , these models predict a very low oh abundance : the h@xmath0o 179.5 @xmath5 m line is predicted to be two orders of magnitude brighter than the oh 84.5 @xmath5 m doublet , while we observe comparable brightnesses .",
    "the relatively low excitation we observe for the h@xmath0o and oh molecules ( @xmath93  k ) suggests that the gas we are observing is not presently hot enough for the rapid h@xmath0o production .",
    "but this does not preclude the h@xmath0o having formed in a short - lived , high - temperature region , and we observe only the cooling region .",
    "we observe _ more _",
    "h@xmath0o than oh , suggesting that high - temperature chemistry was operative long enough to leave a lasting effect on the chemistry of this gas .",
    "the detection of oh , with an abundance only 7 times less than that of h@xmath0o , disagrees with theoretical models for c shocks , which predict nearly complete conversion of oh into h@xmath0o .",
    "this suggests either ( 1 ) the h@xmath0o abundance is underestimated due to beam - dilution , ( 2 ) we are observing oh and h@xmath0o from different types of shocks in regions with a range of pre - shock densities , or ( 3 ) the models are not appropriate for the molecular shocks in 3c  391 .",
    "we detected bright ionic lines ( including [ o  iii ] and [ n  iii ] ) that are only expected from dissociative shocks , so we know that a range of shocks is present within our beam .",
    "however , the infrared oh line ratios are consistent with coming from a region with the same physical conditions as inferred from the infrared h@xmath0o , millimeter - wave cs , and radio - wave oh maser lines .",
    "the disagreement between observations and predictions is at least partially due to the fact that the models are for non - dissociative shocks ( @xcite ) . including the effects of photodissociation of h@xmath0o by the interstellar radiation field  as well as radiation local to the remnant could produce oh in the abundance we observe ( lockett , gauthier , & elitzur 1998 ) .",
    "the water abundance we derive for 3c  391:bml is significantly lower than that observed from molecular shocks in hh 54 ( @xcite ) or orion ( @xcite ) . in particular , in the orion bn - kl region ,",
    "the h@xmath0o abundance is [ h@xmath0o / h@xmath0]@xmath94 ( @xcite ) , incorporating nearly all of the oxygen in the gas . the difference between the orion bn - kl shock and the 3c  391:bml shock could be due to limited angular resolution : 3c  391 is about 20 times further away than orion , while the angular resolution of our observations is the same as that of harwit et al .",
    "the difference could also be due to details of the interaction between the energetic events ( a steady stellar wind in orion _ vs. _ impulsive supernova shock in 3c  391 ) and the interstellar medium ( a molecular cloud and h  ii region in orion _ vs. _ a giant molecular cloud with no h  ii region in 3c  391 ) .",
    "for the first time , thermal emission from the lower energy - levels of h@xmath0o and oh were detected from a supernova remnant .",
    "the emission arises from gas cooling behind a shock front that is impinging a particularly dense clump in the parent molecular cloud ; this site is called 3c 391:bml ( broad molecular line ) .",
    "our spectra of interaction sites in w  44 and w  28 did not reveal oh or h@xmath0o emission , although co emission and oh ( foreground ) absorption were detected .",
    "3c  391 is not a unique case of a supernova remnant - molecular cloud interaction , but the infrared molecular lines imply the presence of higher - density clumps than near w  44 and w  28 , similar to ic  443 .",
    "together with outflows from young stars , supernova remnants are energetic events capable of altering cloud chemistry and producing substantial columns of h@xmath0o and oh . supernova - molecular cloud interactions are probably common , and they have been suggested as an explanation for a new class of mixed - morphology x - ray and radio supernova remnants ( @xcite )",
    ". we can expect substantial advances in understanding shock - induced chemistry in supernova - molecular cloud interactions by using future observatories capable of higher angular and spectral resolution in the far - infrared , such as planned for sofia ( @xcite ) and first ( @xcite ) , where we will better resolve the fast and slow shocks into gas of varying pre - shock density , and we will better resolve a larger number of spectral lines from each molecule .",
