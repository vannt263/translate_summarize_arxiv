    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) represents a promising methodology for solving electronic structure and quantum many - body problems in general .",
    "the common thread of qmc methods is the use of stochastic sampling both to evaluate expectation values for many - body wave functions as well as to solve the stationary schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "in addition to being a useful tool for treating interactions in a many - body framework , qmc methods can handle many different systems ranging from atoms to molecules to extended crystals .",
    "the obtained results for energy differences are typically within a few percent of experimental values . even on absolute scale qmc correlation energies",
    "are remarkably accurate , reaching 90 - 95% of the exact values . the favorable scaling in the number of particles",
    "makes qmc very promising both in applications and also in further theoretical developments .",
    "the key approximation which hampers further increase in accuracy is the so - called fixed - node approximation which is used to overcome the notorious fermion sign problem .",
    "the fermionic antisymmetry implies that wave functions will have both positive and negative negative values ; however , the statistical approaches such as qmc typically require non - negative distributions otherwise they become inefficient .",
    "one means of overcoming this fundamental difficulty is to use the node ( wave function zero locus ) between the positive and the negative regions as a boundary condition in solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "this avoids the sign problems since one finds the absolute value of the wave function with prescribed boundaries . in the case that one would know the exact nodal hypersurface , the method would provide the exact solution .",
    "unfortunately one seldom possesses such knowledge .",
    "therefore we have to use the best available nodes which come from optimized trial ( or variational ) wave functions .",
    "we fix the nodal surface of the solution to be identical to the nodes of the trial function and solve the schrdinger equation with approximate nodes .",
    "the fixed - node approximation provides an upper bound to the true energy , and in practice it provides very remarkable accuracy as mentioned above .",
    "the goal of this work is to study the impact of increasing electronic density on the fixed - node bias .",
    "this requires a system which shows significant error in the mean - field ( hartree - fock ) nodes but for which we know an excellent approximation to the exact node @xcite which is not too difficult to construct across the range of densities .",
    "in particular , we focus on studying a `` be - like '' series of four electron systems in a coulombic potential with varying nuclear charge @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we contrast the fixed - node bias of the hartree - fock vs. two - configuration trial wave functions and analyze the corresponding trends as @xmath2 increases .",
    "let us briefly mention the key facts about the fixed - node diffusion monte carlo method ( fn - dmc ) .",
    "consider an operator @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian and @xmath5 is a real parameter ( imaginary time ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that applying this operator to an initial trial wave function @xmath6 @xmath7 projects out the ground state @xmath8 within the given symmetry class . this projection can be formulated as a solution of the imaginary - time schrdinger equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the green function and @xmath11 is the vector of electron coordinates .",
    "we have introduced the importance sampling by @xmath12 so that the desired ground state @xmath13 is obtained from the solution @xmath14 for large @xmath5 .",
    "note that the fixed - node condition implies that @xmath13 vanishes at the nodes of @xmath6 and also that @xmath15 for any @xmath16 .",
    "further details about the fn - dmc method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider the lowest state of four electrons in the coulomb potential with charge z ( we assume atomic units throughout ) . to aid in understanding the nature of fixed - node errors for this system , we recall the properties of the nodal domain topology of the two different trial wave functions .",
    "the hartree - fock ( hf ) trial wave function for be is given by a slater determinant which is block diagonal in spin so that it can be broken into a product of the spin channels @xmath18 \\times \\det[\\phi_{1s}(r_3),\\phi_{2s}(r_4)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 .",
    "the nodes are defined implicitly for any trial wave function as @xmath20 let us analyze the determinant for the non - interacting orbitals first .",
    "we can write analytically the hydrogenic functions as @xmath21 and @xmath22e^{-zr/2}\\ ] ] so that we get @xmath23=0\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a function which does not vanish for any finite @xmath25 while @xmath26 it is then easy to show that the function @xmath27 is monotonous since @xmath28 for any @xmath29 . using numerically accurate hf orbitals for be , it is possible to carry out similar arrangements and to demonstrate qualitatively the same behavior . the monotonicity is important since it immediately implies that equation @xmath30=0 $ ] is equivalent to @xmath31 and also that this is the only solution .",
    "the node of the hf / non - interacting trial function is then given by @xmath32 which clearly shows that there are @xmath33 nodal pockets  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been found some time ago that the correct number of nodal domains is two , see , for example , ref .",
    "( for our purposes it is very instructive that the corresponding fixed - node bias in the correlation energy is significant , about 10% of the correlation energy @xcite . )",
    "the accurate nodal surface for the @xmath34 ground state is actually remarkably well described by two configurations wave function where hf is augmented by adding @xmath35 double excitation which corresponds to a near - degeneracy effect .",
    "this configuration state function is a sum of three slater determinant products @xmath36\\det[\\phi_{1s},\\phi_{2p_i}]$ ] for @xmath37 as required by the @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "the 2-configuration wave function is thus given as @xmath38 where the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the variational coefficients .",
    "we write the many - body wave - function as a product of an antisymmetric determinantal part , @xmath41 , times a jastrow correlation factor @xmath42 our jastrow factor includes 1- , 2- , and 3-body terms and has the form @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are one - body basis terms , the @xmath45 are two - body basis terms , the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are coefficients , and the @xmath49 label electrons while capital @xmath50 labels ions .",
    "the sums in the jastrow factor can be understood as taking into account electron - ion , electron - electron , and electron - electron - ion correlation , respectively  @xcite .",
    "further details about the correlation functions can be found in ref.@xcite . as explained above ,",
    "we employ two types of trial functions .",
    "the first one has the hf nodes so that @xmath51 while the second state @xmath52 our one - particle orbitals were generated using a numerical hf code .",
    "the variational parameters to be optimized in variational monte carlo are the jastrow coefficients , @xmath53 and @xmath48 , a parameter in the basis terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the determinantal weight , @xmath40 .",
    "these were optimized by algorithms which minimize the combination of energy and its variance as described elsewhere ref.@xcite .",
    "all qmc calculations were done using the software package qwalk  @xcite .",
    "the correlation energy is defined as customary @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total non - relativistic energy of an atom with nuclear charge @xmath2 and @xmath58 electrons , while @xmath59 is its hartree - fock counterpart .",
    "@xmath60 can be expanded in a laurent series as in  @xcite @xmath61 we can use mller - plesset perturbation theory to analyze the first few terms . in particular , one finds that @xmath62 . the first term is a sum of the energies of occupied orbitals , @xmath63 where each orbital energy @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "the next term is equal to first order correction to this energy with the perturbing potential being the difference between the exact potential and the effective hartree - fock potential , @xmath66 , @xmath67 which will be linear in @xmath2 .",
    "for the four electron system , @xmath68 will increase linearly with @xmath2  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "chakravorty et .",
    "explain that this is due to the near - degeneracy effect since the single configuration hartree - fock wave function is not the correct zeroth order wave function in the non - interacting limit @xmath69 .",
    "this deficiency means @xmath70 is not equal to @xmath71 . as such , expansions of the hf energy and the actual total energy in z@xmath72 for be and be - like atoms differ in the linear coefficient .",
    "this results in a leading term proportional to @xmath2 in the expression for @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "we carried out the fixed - node calculations for trial functions with @xmath73 and @xmath74 nodes for @xmath75 .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ table : corrvsdensity ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] .",
    "the linear increase with growing @xmath2 is very clear and is quite striking considering that it covers the range from li@xmath76 through be to very highly ionized cases .",
    "interestingly , this linear increase matches the linear increase in the correlation energy based on perturbation analysis above .",
    "in fact , the observed slope of -0.111(1 ) is very close the analytically derived result of -0.0117 for the linear correction of the total energy in the mp2 theory @xcite .    .",
    "the squares correspond to the hf nodes while the circles correspond to the 2-configuration nodes .",
    "the linear fit to the error from the hf nodal structure has a slope of 0.0111(1 ) .",
    "the error bars are much smaller than the plot symbols . ]",
    ".fn - dmc ground state energies for @xmath73 and @xmath74 wave functions compared to the estimated exact energies estimated from experiments  @xcite for z=4 through 28 and extrapolation  @xcite to infinite basis set for z=3 [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     [ table : expectr ]    this is confirmed by the small fixed - node error of the @xmath0 case , less than 4% of @xmath55 , which is much smaller than the error for be which is larger than 10% of @xmath55 .",
    "this is in line with the fact that the li@xmath72 @xmath77 electrons are highly diffuse and jastrow - type correlations play much more important role overall .    one way to look at the nodes is to scan the wave function with a `` probe '' electron or pair of electrons for a given position for the rest of the particles .",
    "one gets a view of the subspace of the 11-dimensional node which corresponds to our system .",
    "we therefore fixed one of the spin - up electrons at @xmath78 and similarly , one of the spin - down electrons at @xmath79 .",
    "we then scanned the space by the remaining pair of electrons and we draw the zero isosurface of the @xmath74 , see fig .  [ fig : beciwf ] .",
    "the scan shows clearly the effect of two configurations which enable the pair of the electrons to `` visit '' both inside and outside region of the two almost concentric spheres which are fused on one side creating thus a nodal `` opening . ''",
    "this can be contrasted with the hf node which is given exactly by two ideal , concentric spheres . during the qmc walker evolution process the pair of particles",
    "thus can not get from outside to inside ",
    "it will be forever locked in one of the ( four ) equivalent domains .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the impact of the density on the fixed - node errors is very significant .",
    "in particular , comparison of @xmath1 with @xmath0 is perhaps the most revealing . for @xmath1",
    "the electron density is highly localized around the nucleus , and the hf orbitals are very close to noninteracting ones since the electron - electron interaction is much smaller than the electron - ion contribution . however , the nodal error is significant both in absolute terms ( 283 mha ) and in relative terms ( 28.6 % of @xmath55 ) .",
    "interestingly , this system is considered `` easy '' in the sense that the one - particle contributions dominate overall . on the other hand ,",
    "li@xmath80 exhibits nontrivial many - body correlations related to the weak anionic bonding which is usually more demanding to describe by traditional approaches based on basis sets and excitations .",
    "in fact , the fndmc result is surprisingly good even with the hf nodes , which , as explained above , have incorrect topology .",
    "this seems counterintuitive but can be understood once we realize that significantly lower density of li@xmath80 make the nodal errors less important .",
    "the second interesting observation is that the two - configuration wave function is very accurate and captures nodes correctly in the range of systems , from the weakly bonded anion to the very highly ionized cations .",
    "although it is easy to understand that the near - degeneracy effect is crucial it is interesting to see that higher excitations appear to have only marginal effect for all studied systems .",
    "we studied the dependence of the fixed - node error on electron density . for this purpose",
    "we have chosen the system of four electrons in a coulomb potential with varying nuclear charge @xmath2 .",
    "this system has somewhat unique properties : the hf wave function s fixed - node bias is rather large , the hf node is invariant to varying @xmath2 , and for the be atom it was known that very accurate nodes were not too difficult to construct . expanding on these insights , our calculations have convincingly shown :    \\a ) the fixed - node bias increases with increasing density and appears to be predominantly linear with @xmath2 and for the case of four - electron be - like coulomb system is very closely related to the first - order correction in the mp2 theory ;    \\b ) the 2-configuration wave function produces highly accurate nodes across the values of @xmath2 we tested , i.e. it appears to be very consistent and basically universal for this system .",
    "this has important implications for the further analysis of the fixed - node errors for larger and more complicated systems since the results suggest that even small fixed - node errors in the region with high electronic density could have much stronger influence on the total correlation energy recovered than large fixed - node errors in low electronic density regions .",
