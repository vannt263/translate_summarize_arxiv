    "prediction of the strength of a solar cycle well in advance is important for predicting the space weather because solar activity affects space weather in several ways  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it may help for understanding the basic physical processes responsible for solar cycle  @xcite .",
    "many characteristics of a solar cycle and of its previous cycles have been used to predict the amplitudes of the cycle  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the north - south asymmetry in solar activity is well known since several decades and has been extensively studied using the data on almost all the solar activity phenomena including sunspot number , sunspot groups , solar flares , prominences / filaments , photospheric magnetic fields , solar rotation and differential rotation , meridional flow , etc . , and revealed many characteristics of it  @xcite .",
    "however , so far no physical or even a significant statistical relationship between the solar activity and its north - south asymmetry is known .",
    "recently , javaraiah ( 2007 , hereafter paper  i ) has found the following statistically high significant relationships between the sums of the areas of the sunspot groups , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( normalized by 1000 ) , in @xmath0@xmath1 latitude interval of the sun s northern hemisphere and in the time interval of @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath2 year to @xmath3 year from the time of the preceding minimum ( @xmath19 ) - and in the same latitude interval of the southern hemisphere but in the time interval of @xmath20 , @xmath18 1.0 year to 1.75 year just after the time of the maximum ( @xmath21)- during a solar cycle @xmath4 and the amplitude ( @xmath22 , maximum of the smoothed monthly sunspot number ) of the next cycle @xmath6 : @xmath23 @xmath24    where @xmath25 represents the waldmeier solar cycle number . the corresponding correlation coefficients of these relations are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . by using equations  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in paper  i",
    "we have found @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , for @xmath22 of the upcoming solar cycle  24 .",
    "since equation  ( 2 ) is statistically more significant than equation  ( 1 ) , hence , in paper  i we have predicted the value @xmath9 for @xmath22 of the upcoming cycle  24 . in the present paper",
    "we have made a detailed study on the north - south asymmetries in the sums of the areas of the spot groups , @xmath18 , differences between the @xmath28 and @xmath29 , during both the time intervals @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the solar cycles @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "this enabled us to find two more new relationships , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and using these to improve the prediction in paper  i for the amplitude of solar cycle  24 .",
    "the physical significance of all the aforementioned relationships is discussed .",
    "it should be noted here that in most of the studies of the north - south asymmetry of a solar activity phenomenon , the north - south asymmetry is determined using the conventional formula , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the corresponding quantities of the activity phenomenon in the northern and the southern hemispheres , respectively .",
    "this fraction has a strong 1112 year periodicity  @xcite .",
    "pointed out that in the north - south asymmetry , derived by using this formula , the 1112 year periodicity has no statistical significance because mostly it is an artifact of the 11-year cycle of @xmath37 . in order to verify this determined the power spectra of both the @xmath38 and the @xmath34 of the sunspot number data and found that a peak at 1112 year in the power spectrum of @xmath38 is statistically insignificant , whereas it is statistically very significant in the spectrum of @xmath34 , confirming the doubt of  .",
    "recently , also confirmed the same .",
    "therefore , the difference @xmath38 seems to represent the north - south asymmetry of a solar activity phenomena more appropriately than the fraction @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , in the present analysis we found that the correlation ( @xmath39 ) between @xmath40 of a cycle @xmath4 and the @xmath22 of cycle @xmath6 is much weaker than that ( @xmath41 ) between the difference @xmath42 during @xmath30 of a cycle @xmath4 and the @xmath22 of the cycle @xmath6 . therefore , here we have used the difference @xmath42 .    since a large number of abbreviations",
    "are used here , hence for the sake of the readers convenience we listed below the meanings of all the abbreviations ( thanks are due to the anonymous referee s suggestion ) :    * @xmath4 - the waldmeier solar cycle number , * @xmath19 - the preceding minimum epoch of a solar cycle , * @xmath21 - the maximum epoch of a solar cycle , * @xmath43 - the value of smoothed monthly sunspot number in @xmath19 , * @xmath22 - the value of smoothed monthly number in @xmath21 , * @xmath30 - the time - interval of @xmath2 year to @xmath3 year from @xmath19 , * @xmath31 - the time - interval of @xmath44 year to @xmath45 year just after @xmath21 , * @xmath46 - the sum of the areas of spot groups in @xmath47 latitude interval of the northern hemisphere during @xmath30 of a cycle @xmath4 , * @xmath48 - the sum of the areas of spot groups in @xmath47 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere during @xmath30 of a cycle @xmath4 , * @xmath49 - the sum of the areas of spot groups in @xmath47 latitude interval of the northern hemisphere during @xmath31 of a cycle @xmath4 , * @xmath50 - the sum of the areas of spot groups in @xmath47 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere during @xmath31 of a cycle @xmath4 , * @xmath51 - the difference @xmath52 , * @xmath53 - the sum @xmath54 , and * @xmath55 - the sum @xmath56 .    in the next section",
    "we describe the data analysis and the results . in section  3",
    "we discuss about the implications of the relationships among @xmath46 , @xmath50 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for understanding the underlying physical process of the solar cycle . for this purpose",
    "we have determined the variations in the mean meridional motions of the spot groups in the northern and the southern hemispheres during the odd numbered cycles ( 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 23 ) and the even numbered cycles ( 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 ) , using the superposed epoch analysis as described in . in the same section",
    "we compare our prediction with other authors predictions for the @xmath22 of solar cycle  24 , particularly with those predictions based on the flux - transport - dynamo models , and the spectral analyses and magnetic oscillations models . in section  4",
    ", we have given the summary of the results and the conclusions .",
    "here we have used the values of @xmath15 and @xmath60 , @xmath18 , the sums of the areas of the sunspot groups in @xmath61 latitude intervals of the northern and the southern hemispheres during the time intervals @xmath30 and @xmath31 of cycles 1223 , which were determined in paper i by using the greenwich sunspot group data during the period 18741976 , and the sunspot group data from the solar optical observing network ( soon ) of the us air force / us national oceanic and atmospheric administration during 1977 january 12005 september 30 .",
    "the recently updated these data were taken from the nasa web - site of david hathaway ( http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch.shtml ) . in table  1",
    "we have given the values of @xmath15 and @xmath60 during both the time intervals @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the maximum ( @xmath22 ) and the minimum ( @xmath43 ) amplitudes ( the largest and the smallest smoothed monthly mean sunspot numbers ) and the corresponding epochs @xmath21 and @xmath19 of the solar - cycles 1223 ( the values of @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath43 and @xmath22 of cycles  1223 are taken from the website , ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/solar_data/sunspot_numbers ) .",
    "the details of the data reduction and the analysis were described in paper  i. the method of determination of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as described in paper i , is as follows : first we determine the sums of the daily areas of the spot groups in the time - intervals whose lengths are chosen arbitrarily around the minimum and the maximum of a cycle @xmath4 and @xmath22 of the cycle @xmath6 or @xmath64 , etc . ,",
    "and then we determine the exact time intervals by increasing or decreasing the arbitrary intervals with 0.05 year until we get the maximum correlation .",
    "we have chosen this method because the lengths of the solar cycles vary .",
    "however , it may be possible to obtain the similar results by binning the available data for the entire period ( 19742007 ) into successive intervals of suitable sizes and then picking the intervals close to the minimum and maximum epochs of the cycles .    note : in case of @xmath65 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere , a reasonably good correlation is found between the sum of the areas of the spot groups during a long time - interval approximately one year after the maximum to approximately two year before the end of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath22 of cycle @xmath6 . since the correlation is maximum for @xmath31 ,",
    "hence we have considered it . although @xmath31 is much shorter than @xmath30",
    ", @xmath63 is considerably larger than @xmath62 .",
    "hence , in spite of @xmath31 is short the @xmath63 time series is also well defined .",

    "the amplitude of the cycle - to - cycle variation of @xmath62 is much larger than that of the corresponding variation of @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath62 leads @xmath22 by about 13 years [ as already known from the relationship , equation  ( 1 ) above ] .",
    "the cycle - to - cycle variation in @xmath66 is weak [ @xmath66 is almost constant from cycle 14 to cycle 20 ] , but there is an evidence for the existence of a weak 8090 year cycle ( gleissberg cycle ) . in figure",
    "1(b ) it can be seen that there is no much difference between the maximum amplitudes of the variations in @xmath67 and @xmath63 .",
    "as we already know from paper  i the pattern of @xmath63 is similar to that of @xmath62 ( @xmath68 ) , and @xmath63 leads @xmath22 by about 910 years .",

    "it can be seen that there exits an approximate anticorrelation ( @xmath75 ) between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "in the same figure it can also be seen that there is a strong suggestion of the existence of the @xmath1044-year periodicity in both @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "a 3344 year periodicity is also found in the power spectrum analysis of the data on north - south asymmetries in sunspot activity  @xcite and long - lived solar filaments  @xcite .",
    "this periodicity is dominant in the north - south asymmetries of the solar equatorial and the differential rotation rates determined from sunspot group data @xcite , and it seems to be present prominently in the climatically related phenomena and in the earth rotation rate , which may be related to the 44-year cycle ( double hale cycle ) of solar magnetic activity @xcite .      in figure",
    "2(b ) it can be seen that the cross - correlation function ccf@xmath71 of @xmath22 and @xmath76 has a strong peak ( 0.9 ) at @xmath80 , suggesting that @xmath76 leads @xmath22 by about 13 years , which is equal to the phase difference between @xmath62 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , using @xmath76 of cycle @xmath4 we can predict @xmath22 of cycle @xmath6 .",
    "the ccf@xmath71 of @xmath22 and @xmath77 has a maximum negative value also at @xmath80 , but its magnitude is inadequate for predicting @xmath59 by using @xmath81 .",

    "the amplitudes of the upcoming sunspot cycles can be predicted by about 13 year advance .",
    "the result of the least - square fit is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the correlation between simulated amplitude ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath22 , and also the level of the significance , are found to be the same as that between @xmath88 and @xmath59 .",
    "using equation  ( 3 ) we obtained the value @xmath12 for @xmath22 of the upcoming cycle  24 .",
    "it should be noted that since @xmath22 of cycle  23 is already known , hence it is included in the fittings of equations  ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , although it is not needed for predicting @xmath22 of cycle  24 .",
    "that is , using the values of @xmath62 and @xmath78 of cycle 23 and the linear - relationships determined from the 9 pairs of data points correspond to the cycle pairs 12,13 to 21,22 , we can get almost the same values for @xmath22 of cycle  24 as found above . since cycle  23",

    "the statistical significances of the value , @xmath93 , predicted here by using equation  ( 3 ) and the value , @xmath9 , predicted in paper  i by using equation  ( 2 ) are equal , but the difference between these values is considerably large ( it is marginally less than 2@xmath86 ) .",
    "therefore , we are unable to predict that between these values which will become close to the real @xmath22 of cycle  24 , although we are confident about that the cycle  24 will be smaller than cycle  23 .    on the other hand , equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) may represent the different components of the total contributions of @xmath46 , @xmath57 and @xmath50 to @xmath59 . hence , it is necessary to find a relationship between the combinations of @xmath46 , @xmath57 and @xmath50 and the @xmath59 .",
    "we find that the @xmath94 , @xmath18 sum of the area sums used in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , of cycle @xmath4 correlates very well ( @xmath95 with the @xmath59 .",
    "further , the correlation between @xmath96 and @xmath59 is very high ( @xmath13 ) . from this relationship",
    "we get the following relation :    @xmath97 whose statistical significance is very high , @xmath18 , higher than those of all the relations ( 1)(3 ) . figure  ( 4 ) shows a scatter plot of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . by using equation  ( 4 )",
    "the prediction of the amplitude of a cycle is possible by about 9 years in advance with a high accuracy . using equation  ( 4 ) we get @xmath14 for @xmath22 of the upcoming cycle  24 , which is about 28% less than the @xmath22 of cycle  23 .",
    "figures  5(a ) and 5(b ) show the plots of the simulated amplitudes ( @xmath87 ) , simulated by using equations ( 1)(4 ) , and the corresponding differences , @xmath92 , against solar cycle number 1323 . in figure  5(a ) we have also shown the variation in @xmath22 during these cycles , and all the predicted values for @xmath22 of cycle  24 .",
    "the uncertainties in the predicted values correspond to 1@xmath86 values of @xmath92 shown in figure  5(b ) . in these figures",
    "it can be seen that the values of @xmath87 and @xmath22 closely agree each other , in the cases of equations ( 2)(3 ) .",
    "this agreement is much higher in the case of equation ( 4 ) .      according to the well - known gnevyshev and ohl , or g - o , rule @xcite a preceding even numbered cycle is weaker than its following odd numbered cycle .",
    "however , occasionally the g - o rule is violated .",
    "figure  6 shows the annual variation of sunspot number during 16102006 . as can be seen in this figure , cycle  23",
    "is an anomalous cycle in the sense that the cycle pair 22,23 violated the g - o rule .",
    "the cycle  5 is also an anomalous cycle ( the cycle pair 4,5 violated the g - o rule ) and it is followed by the week cycles 6 and 7 .",
    "that is , a violation of the g - o rule seems to be followed by a few small cycles ( see also  ) .",
    "therefore , the violation of the g - o rule by cycle pair 22,23 also indicates that the next cycle  24 ( probably even the cycle  25 ) will be a weak cycle .    in principle the g - o rule can be used for predicting @xmath22 of an odd numbered cycle from that of its preceding even numbered cycle .",
    "but this is possible only when we know in advance that the even- and odd - numbered cycle pair will not violate the g - o rule . for instance , in order to predict @xmath22 of cycle  25 from that of cycle  24 ( when it will be known ) by applying the g - o rule , it is necessary and essential to know in advance that cycle pair  24,25 will not violate the g - o rule .",
    "recently , shown that it may be possible to forecast the epochs of the violations of the g - o rule well in advance from the epochs of retrograde motion of the sun about the solar system barycenter .",
    "except that so far no plausible method is available for predicting the violation of the g - o rule .",
    "as can be seen in figures  1(a ) and 1(b ) the values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 are higher in an even numbered cycle than in its following odd numbered cycle , say inverse g - o rule , except in case of cycle pair 20,21 .",
    "that is , this inverse g - o rule in @xmath62 and @xmath63 is violated by about 22 years ( a hale cycle ) earlier than the corresponding violation of the g - o rule in @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the studies of variations in @xmath62 and @xmath63 may also help for predicting a future even- and odd - numbered cycle pair which will violate the g - o rule , by about 22 years ( a hale cycle ) advance . since cycle pair  22,23 satisfies the aforementioned inverse g - o rule , hence , probably cycle pair 24,25 will satisfy the g - o rule , @xmath18 probably cycle  25 will be stronger than cycle  24 .    in figures  1(a ) , 1(b ) and 2(a ) it can be seen that a @xmath1044-year periodicity exists in @xmath22 also .",
    "however , it is not as strong as the corresponding periodicity in @xmath62 and @xmath63 and in their corresponding north - south differences",
    ". found that in sunspot data only 11-year periodicity is statistically significant and all the remaining periodicities are only minor fluctuations .",
    "as can be seen in figure  2(a ) the @xmath30 epochs of the cycles 15 , 19 , and 23 are at the minimum epochs of the @xmath1044-year cycle in @xmath78 , whereas the corresponding epochs of @xmath31 are at the maximum epochs of the 44-year cycles in @xmath77 . in figure  6",
    "it can be seen that the odd numbered cycles 11 , 15 and 19 are followed by the weak even numbered cycles 12 , 16 and 20 .",
    "cycle 7 is also weak and followed by the strong cycle  8 .",
    "however , the cycle pair 8,9 violated the g - o rule . as pointed out above probably the cycle pair 24,25 will not violate the g - o rule .",
    "all these indicate that cycle 24 will be weaker than cycle  23 .",
    "thus , from the @xmath1044-year periodic variations of @xmath78 and @xmath77 one can infer that the upcoming cycle  24 will be weaker than cycle  23 .",
    "from the patterns of @xmath76 and @xmath77 we can also infer that the upcoming cycles  24 and 28 may be at the beginning ( @xmath18 , the end of the current gleissberg cycle ) and the ending minimum epochs of the next 44-year cycle , respectively ( the cycles 32 , 36 and so on may be also weak cycles ) . in both @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and also in @xmath22 , the patterns of the 44-year cycles are considerably different from one 44-year cycle to another . in case of @xmath77 , the pattern of its variation seems to be changing in the alternate 8090-year cycles , indicating that the pattern of the next 44-year cycle may be the same as that of the current 44-year cycle .",
    "therefore , since the cycle  21 is stronger than cycle  20 , we can expect that the cycle  25 will be stronger than cycle  24 .",
    "this is consistent with the speculation above , @xmath98 probably the cycle pair 24,25 will satisfy the g - o rule .",
    "according to equations ( 1)(4 ) , a large / less value of any of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath76 and @xmath99 , @xmath18 a large / less emergence of the magnetic flux ( unsigned ) in the corresponding @xmath61 latitude interval of the northern or the southern hemisphere during @xmath30 and @xmath31 , of a cycle @xmath4 implies a large / less emergence of the magnetic flux at @xmath21 of the next cycle @xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted here that the epochs @xmath31 of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 are around the begin and the end of a same polarity half solar magnetic cycle which comprises the declining phase of the cycle @xmath4 and the rising phase of the cycle @xmath6 , whereas the epoch @xmath30 is around the middle of the opposite polarity half solar magnetic cycle which comprises the declining phase of the cycle @xmath100 and the rising phase of the cycle @xmath4 . there",
    "exist strong correlations between @xmath46 , @xmath101 and @xmath50 , whereas there is no significant correlation either between @xmath102 and @xmath50 or between @xmath103 and @xmath50 .",
    "this confirms that @xmath62 and @xmath76 lead @xmath104 by about 5 years .",
    "it also suggests that the emergence / cancellation of the magnetic flux at @xmath30 of cycle @xmath4 may influence on the emergence / cancellations of the magnetic flux at both the @xmath31 of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 .",
    "the emergence / cancellation of the flux at @xmath21 of cycle @xmath4 may not have an influence on the emergence / cancellation of the flux at @xmath30 of cycle @xmath6 .",
    "even it may not have an influence on the emergence of the flux at @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the high correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath59 may be due to the influence of the emergence / cancellation of the magnetic flux at @xmath30 of cycle @xmath4 on the emergence / cancellation of the flux at both epochs @xmath31 of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 .",
    "the existence of an inverse g - o rule in @xmath62 and @xmath104 was pointed out in section  2.5 .",
    "it may be interesting to note here that a similar behavior was also found in the latitudinal gradient of the solar rotation determined from the sunspot group data  @xcite .",
    "hence , the emergence / cancellation of the magnetic flux at the epochs @xmath30 and @xmath31 of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 , i.e. all the relationships found above , may be related to the long - term variations , @xmath10 22 years and longer , in the differential rotation  @xcite .",
    "it is well accepted that the solar dynamo , which seems to be located near the base of the sun s convection zone , generates the solar magnetic field for solar activity and the solar cycle  @xcite .",
    "the sun s polar fields , solar meridional flows and differential rotation are important ingredients in the dynamo models ( , and references therein ) .",
    "the solar meridional flows can transport magnetic flux and play a major role for the magnetic flux cancellation and the polar field reversals ( and references therein ) .",
    "as already suggested in paper  i , the relationships between @xmath46 and @xmath50 and @xmath59 may have a physical relationship with the solar magnetic cycle and the temporal variations of the solar equatorial rotation rate and the meridional flows .",
    "figure  7 shows the variations in the mean meridional velocity , @xmath105 , of sunspot groups during the odd and the even numbered solar cycles determined by superposing the spot group data during cycles 1123 according to the years relative to the nearest sunspot minimum epochs 1867 , 1879 , 1890 , 1902 , 1913 , 1923 , 1934 , 1944 , 1954,1965 , 1976 , 1987 , and 1997 .",
    "the data reduction and analysis are the same as in .",
    "now we have also used the spot group data during cycles  2223 .",
    "this increased the size of the data considerably .",
    "hence , it enabled us to determine somewhat reliable variations in the mean meridional motions of spot groups in the northern and the southern hemispheres during the odd cycles ( 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 23 ) and the even cycles ( 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 ) . noticed the existence of a difference in the meridional motions of spot groups during the odd and the even cycles and suggested the existence of a 22 year periodicity in the solar meridional flow .",
    "assumed that there exist 22-year meridional oscillations which change the sign of the angular velocity gradient with respect to the relic magnetic field lines causing 22-year solar magnetic oscillations .",
    "hence , in order to look for a longer than 11-year periodicity ( @xmath1022 year periodicity ) in the meridional flow , in figure  7 the values of the mean meridional motion of spot groups during the odd cycles are plotted against the years 1 to 12 and the corresponding values of the even cycles are plotted against the years 1323 .",
    "a vertical dashed line is drawn at the year 12.5 to identify the ends of the odd numbered cycles and the beginnings of the even numbered cycles .",
    "this figure reveals more information than the figure  2 of , where the data from both the odd- and even - numbered cycles are combined .",
    "as can be seen in figure  7 there are considerable differences in the mean meridional motions of the spot groups in a given hemisphere during the odd and the even cycles .",
    "for example , at the beginning of an odd cycle the motions are equator - ward directions in the @xmath47 latitude intervals of both the northern and the southern hemispheres ( the motions in the northern and the southern hemisphere are southbound and northbound , respectively ) .",
    "but this is opposite at the beginning of an even cycle , @xmath18 the motions are in pole - ward directions in @xmath47 latitude intervals of both the hemispheres .",
    "there is an indication that the motion in the @xmath61 latitude interval of the northern hemisphere rapidly changed ( in about two years time ) from the pole - ward ( northbound ) direction at the end of an even cycle , say @xmath4 , to the equator - ward ( southbound ) at the begin of the following odd cycle , say @xmath6 . in @xmath47 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere",
    "the motion is not significantly different from zero at the end of an even cycle @xmath4 , but it became significantly different from zero and equator - ward ( northbound ) direction at the begin of the following odd cycle , @xmath6 .",
    "these opposite directions of the mean meridional motions of the spot groups suggest that around the begin of an odd numbered cycle the solar meridional flows may transport magnetic flux across the equator causing cancellation of a large amount of the magnetic flux around the equator",
    ". the equator - ward meridional flows may include large contributions of the down flows at the active regions in the sunspot latitude belt .",
    "the cancellation of the flux is relatively weak or even absent around the begin of an even numbered cycle , because the motions are pole - ward in @xmath47 latitude intervals of both the hemispheres . during the declining phase of any cycle , until approximately one year before the end of the cycle the motions are equator - ward directions in @xmath61 latitude intervals of both the northern and the southern hemispheres .",
    "this may cause cancellation of some amount of magnetic flux around the equator during the declining phases of the cycles .",
    "as we have already found in paper  i , the time - intervals @xmath30 and @xmath31 included the epochs when the motion is changed to pole - ward to equator - ward .",
    "all the aforementioned suggestions of the variations in the mean meridional motions of the spot groups are very well consistent with the differences between the odd and the even numbered cycles in the values of @xmath46 , @xmath57 and @xmath50 and the physical interpretations drawn in section 3.1 , above .",
    "in addition , the overall pattern of the mean meridional motion of the spot groups in @xmath65 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere suggests that about 910 year periodicity is relatively dominant in the solar meridional flow in this latitude interval .",
    "the corresponding pattern in the @xmath47 latitude interval of the northern hemisphere suggests that a relatively longer periodicity of about 1520 years ( probably even longer than this , i.e. @xmath1030 years ) , is dominant in the solar meridional flow in this latitude interval .",
    "here we concentrated mainly on the mean solar cycle variation of the meridional motions of the spot groups in @xmath61 latitude intervals of the northern and the southern hemispheres .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  7 the behavior of the mean motions in the high latitudes are substantially different from those of the low latitudes .",
    "it is consistent with the discussion in paper  i on the implications of the north - south asymmetries in the latitude distributions of the solar flare activity during a solar cycle ( @xmath106  ) , and on the large north - south asymmetry in the sunspot activity during the later maunder minimum ( see ) .",
    "it is interesting to note here that during cycle  23 the mean meridional motion of the sunspot groups is stronger than that during about last 910 cycles .",
    "that is , during cycle  23 ( around maximum epoch ) the motion is strongly pole - ward in the northern hemisphere and strongly equator - ward in the southern hemisphere ( see figures  8 and 9 in  ) .",
    "that is , the overall mean motion is northbound and may be responsible for the cancellation of a large amount of magnetic flux during this cycle ( mainly during the declining phase ) and the flux cancellation might be relatively more in the northern hemisphere than in southern hemisphere .",
    "hence , the cycle  23 is weak and the activity is slightly more in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere , mainly during the declining phase of this cycle .",
    ", of the sunspot groups in the northern hemisphere ( filled circles and solid curves ) and the southern hemisphere ( open circles and dotted curves ) during the odd numbered solar cycles ( 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 23 ) and the even numbered cycles ( 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 ) .",
    "the minima of the odd- and even - numbered cycles correspond to year one and thirteen , respectively .",
    "averages are taken over 2-year intervals .",
    "the vertical dashed line at year 12.5 is drawn to identify the ends of the odd numbered cycles and the beginnings of the even numbered cycles . in both the northern and southern hemispheres , the positive values of the velocity indicate pole - ward motions and the negative values indicate equator - ward motions .",
    "the horizontal solid lines represent the zero values of @xmath105.,width=453 ]      a large number of forecasting methods ( precursors , spectral analysis , non - linear dynamics , solar system dynamics , etc . )",
    "are used to predict the amplitudes of the solar cycles .",
    "there have been many predictions for the @xmath22 of cycle  24 , but their range is very wide ( for the list of these predictions see   and ) .",
    "therefore , the solar cycle  24 prediction panel found difficult to came out consensus on any single value and supports to the two possible peak amplitudes , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , for the smoothed monthly value of the international sunspot number of this cycle ( http://www.sec.noaa.gov/solarcycle/sc24/statement_01.html ) .",
    "our prediction is on the low value side .    among all the methods of forecasting of the maximum amplitudes of the solar cycles , precursor method based on the correlation between the strength of a geophysical phenomenon in the declining phase of a cycle and the strength of its immediate following cycle , initiated by  , seems to be most successful one  @xcite .",
    "recently , and by using the current strength of the geomagnetic @xmath109 index as a precursor predicted @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , for @xmath22 of cycle  24 . used for the first time the strength of the polar magnetic field at the preceding minimum epoch of a cycle as the precursive indicator for the amplitude of the same cycle .",
    "this method has a physical background in the sense that the strength of the polar field during the minimum of a cycle is an important ingredient for dynamo models of the solar cycle . using this method and",
    "the current weak strength of the polar field near the end of the ongoing cycle  23 , measured in wilcox observatory , predicted @xmath112 and predicted @xmath113 for @xmath22 of cycle  24 .",
    "recently , on the basis of the current strength of the polar field measured in the mount wilson observatory , which is weaker than the strength of the polar filed at the preceding minimum of cycle  22 , ulrich , r.k . and",
    "boyden , j.e . also predicted that cycle  24 will be weaker than cycle  23 ( private communication from ulrich , r.k . and",
    "boyden , j.e . , http://astro.ucla.edu/  ulrich/ ) . suggested a large value @xmath114 for @xmath22 of cycle  24 , using the fast equatorial drift rate of sunspot activity ( @xmath18 fast equatorial meridional motion ) during the declining phase of cycle  22 found by  .    and by inputting the data on sunspot group area during the cycles  1223 to a flux - transport dynamo model , predicted a very large amplitude , 150180 , for @xmath22 of cycle  24 .",
    "one of the main assumptions of their model is a long , about 1723 year , magnetic memory ( a slow diffusion of magnetic field ) . on the other hand and by inputting the strength of the observed polar field , @xmath18 , by using the same data that used by  , into another type of flux - transport model , theoretically confirmed the low values predicted by   and .",
    "this model assumes a short magnetic memory of about 5-year time ( a fast diffusion of magnetic fields ) .",
    "studied the origin of the predictive skill of the flux - transport dynamo models , theoretically and observationally by using both the sunspot area data during cycles 1223 and the sunspot numbers during cycles 123 , and found that the assumed values for the parameters of the aforementioned flux - transport dynamo models are ineffective , so that the predictive power lies in the temporal behavior of the observational data used in these models .",
    "they have concluded that since the stronger cycles tend to rise faster to their maximum activity ( waldmeier effect ) , the origin of the predictive power in the above mentioned flux - transport dynamo models is the shifts of the minimum epochs of the cycles due to temporal overlapping of the cycles , and hence the predictive skill does not require a magnetic memory . however , and assumed a long , 1723 year , magnetic memory .",
    "hence , a major contribution to their prediction for cycle  24 might have also come before the overlapping period of the cycles  23 and 24 .",
    "in addition , recently found that the waldmeier effect is not present in sunspot area . in our case ,",
    "first of all we have used the data on the spot groups in @xmath61 latitude intervals only . obviously , the epoch @xmath30 of a cycle @xmath4 is quite far away from the overlapping period of the cycles @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath31 of a cycle @xmath4 is just one year away from the @xmath21 of cycle @xmath4 , @xmath18 , it is also considerably far away from the time of the overlapping of the cycles @xmath4 and @xmath6 . as already found in paper  i , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of a cycle @xmath4 are close to the epochs when the polarity reversals of the global magnetic fields take place  ( , 2003 ) .",
    "of course , as already mentioned above the @xmath31 of cycle @xmath4 and the @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 are in the same polarity half magnetic cycle .",
    "the values we have predicted for @xmath22 of cycle  24 , by using equations  ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , are close to the low values predicted by   and . however , by using our method the prediction can be made by at least four years earlier than their method . both , and ourselves used the same spot group data which are taken from david hathaway s website ( we have used the raw data files which contain the daily measurements ) .",
    "they have obtained a high correlation ( @xmath115 ) between the simulated and the observed strengths of the eight cycles , 1623 .",
    "our prediction is much more statistically significant than their prediction , because we have @xmath116 from eleven data points .",
    "since their model needs 1723 year magnetic memory , hence , in their simulation for a cycle @xmath6 a major contribution might have come also from cycle @xmath100 and even from before it , besides a contribution from the cycle @xmath4 .",
    "their predicted value for @xmath22 of cycle  24 is large probably because of a large contribution to it came from the large cycle  22 and even also from cycle  21 which is also a large cycle , besides a contribution by cycle  23 .",
    "they have used a constant value , 14 m s@xmath117 , for the speed of the meridional flow , whereas the speed of the meridional flow may vary considerably ( @xmath118 , section  3.2 above and  ) .",
    "in addition , they have assumed a profile for cycle  24 whose size is almost equal to that of cycle  23 .",
    "however , they found a large value even without assuming any profile for cycle  24 and were able to correctly reproduce the small amplitude of cycle  20 .",
    "our case is also based on the long - term variations in the sunspot activity .",
    "but for the prediction of a cycle @xmath6 the main contribution comes from around the preceding minimum and near the maximum of cycle @xmath4 ( for predicted @xmath22 of cycle  24 the main contribution comes from cycle  23 ) and that too only from the @xmath47 latitude interval .",
    "however , our case does not rule out the possibility of some minor contributions of cycle @xmath100 and around the minimum of cycle @xmath6 itself , particularly from the high latitudes .",
    "in fact , it may be necessary to take into account of such contributions , because the magnetic fields at different latitudes during different time - intervals of a previous cycle might contribute to the activity at the same or different latitudes during the next cycle .",
    "if we can include such contributions , then we may get an improvement in the corresponding correlation of equation  ( 4 ) , from 98% to 100% , and a value for @xmath22 of cycle  24 which may be considerably different than the values predicted here .",
    "recently , found a reasonably good correlation ( @xmath119 ) between the sum of the sunspot group numbers in the latitude intervals @xmath120 and @xmath121 of the northern hemisphere during a preceding minimum of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath22 of cycle @xmath6 , and predicted 129.7@xmath12216.3 for @xmath22 of cycle 24 . as we have already mentioned in section  2.4 ,",
    "all our predictions are consistent with that now the level of activity is at the declining phase of the current gleissberg cycle  @xcite .",
    "however , the earlier result itself is yet to be confirmed .",
    "the properties of the solar cycles can also be explained on the basis of superpositions of the dominant modes of the sun s global magnetic oscillations whose frequencies equal to that of the solar magnetic cycle and a few harmonics of it ( @xmath106  ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "such a model has a strong predictive power ( @xmath106  ) .",
    "a number of authors used various spectroscopic methods and predicted around 100 for @xmath22 of cycle  24 ( @xmath106  ; ) . recently , modeled the solar cycle as a forced and damped harmonic oscillator . by inputting the amplitudes ,",
    "frequencies , and phases of 22 cycles ( 17551996 ) derived from the aforementioned model into an autoregressive model , predicted the periods and the amplitudes of the next fifteen solar cycles .",
    "his prediction for @xmath22 of cycle  24 is @xmath123",
    ". it may be interesting to note here that some cycles , including cycle  23 , contain double peaks .",
    "interpreted this property of the solar cycles as an 11 year cycle consisting of two processes ( waves ? ) with different physical properties and the shape of the cycle depends on the way these processes overlap .",
    "that is , the occurrence of a double peak cycle may be mainly related to the difference between the phases of the processes ( waves ) involved .",
    "that is , a large difference in the initial phases of the waves may be responsible for a small and broad or double peak , and also long period , cycle .",
    "a number of authors also explored the possibility that the solar cycle is a sum of two periodic functions ( @xmath106  ) .",
    "the variations in @xmath76 and @xmath63 may represent the two dominant magnetic waves ( quadrupole and dipole components of the global magnetic oscillations ) in the sun , whose superposition may be responsible for the long - term variations in the amplitudes of solar cycles .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath76 lead @xmath63 by about 4 years .",
    "the difference between @xmath30 of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 is 1418 years , and that between @xmath31 of cycle @xmath4 and @xmath21 of cycle @xmath6 is 912 years , which may represent the periods of the aforementioned waves .",
    "such periodicities are found to exist also in the solar differential rotation determined from sunspot group data  @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath10 22-year periodicity is detected also in the solar rotation determined from the data on large - scale magnetic fields measured using the h@xmath124 line , magnetographic observations , and spectral - corona observations  @xcite .",
    "we think the combined effect of the sun s rotation and the inclination of the sun s equator to the ecliptic may have a major role in all the relationships found above .",
    "using the values of the sums of the areas , @xmath15 and @xmath60 , of the spot groups in @xmath61 latitude intervals of the northern and the southern hemispheres and during the time intervals @xmath30 and @xmath31 of cycle 1223 determined in paper  i , we have found the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath62 varies strongly with a period of about 44 years ( double hale cycle ) , whereas there exits a weak 8090 year gleissberg cycle in @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath63 is also having a 44-year periodicity , whereas @xmath67 has a somewhat different periodicity of about 3344 years .",
    "3 .   there exist statistically significant north - south asymmetries in the aforementioned sums of the areas of spot groups , @xmath18 , there exist statistically significant differences @xmath125 and @xmath74 .",
    "4 .   @xmath76 and @xmath126 vary approximately in opposite phase .",
    "both these vary strongly with a periodicity of about 44 years .",
    "the patterns of the 44-year cyclic variations in @xmath76 and @xmath77 strongly indicate that the upcoming cycle  24 will be weaker than cycle  23 and it will be the beginning minimum epoch of the next 44-year cycle ( it may be also the end of the current gleissberg cycle ) .",
    "the next such a minimum may be represented by cycle  28 .",
    "6 .   as in the case of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "the north - south difference , @xmath76 of a cycle , correlates well with @xmath22 of its immediate following cycle . by using this relationship",
    "it is possible to predict the amplitude of a cycle by about 13-year advance , with an improved accuracy . using this relationship",
    "we have obtained @xmath12 for the amplitude of the upcoming solar cycle  24 .",
    "the correlation between the sum @xmath127 of a cycle and @xmath22 of its immediate following cycle is very high . by using this relationship",
    "it is possible to predict the amplitude of a cycle by about 9 years in advance with a high accuracy . using this relationship",
    "we have obtained @xmath14 for @xmath22 of cycle  24 , which is about 28% less than the @xmath22 of cycle  23 .",
    "8 .   in the cycle - to - cycle variations of @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "there is an indication of the upcoming cycle pair  24,25 will not violate the g - o rule , @xmath18 it seems cycle  25 will be stronger than cycle  24 . 9 .",
    "there exists a considerable difference between the variations in the mean meridional motions of the spot groups during the odd numbered and the even numbered cycle .",
    "these variations suggest that there exist about 910 year and 1520 year periodicities in the mean meridional motions of the spot groups in @xmath65 latitude intervals of the southern and the northern hemispheres , respectively .",
    "the spacial ( latitudinal ) patterns of the aforementioned variations in the mean meridional motions of the sunspot groups suggest that the solar meridional flow may transport magnetic flux across the solar equator and potentially responsible for all the relationships found here .",
    "consequently , our results are not only highly statistically significant and useful for an accurate prediction of the amplitude of the upcoming cycle  24 , but also have many implications for understanding the underlying physical process responsible for the solar cycle .",

    "<S> here we found that the north - south asymmetries in the aforementioned area sums have a strong @xmath10 44-year periodicity and from this we can infer that the upcoming cycle 24 will be weaker than cycle  23 . in case of ( 1 ) , the north - south asymmetry in the area sum of a cycle @xmath4 also has a relationship , say ( 3 ) , with the amplitude of cycle  @xmath6 , which is similar to ( 1 ) but more statistically significant ( @xmath11 ) like ( 2 ) . by using ( 3 ) </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to predict the amplitude of a cycle with a better accuracy by about 13 years in advance , and we get @xmath12 for the amplitude of the upcoming cycle  24 . however , we found a similar but a more statistically significant ( @xmath13 ) relationship , say ( 4 ) , by using the sum of the area sum used in ( 2 ) and the north - south difference used in ( 3 ) . by using ( 4 ) it is possible to predict the amplitude of a cycle by about 9 years in advance with a high accuracy and we get @xmath14 for the amplitude of cycle  24 , which is about 28% less than the amplitude of cycle  23 . </S>",
    "<S> our results also indicate that cycle  25 will be stronger than cycle  24 . </S>",
    "<S> the variations in the mean meridional motions of the spot groups during odd and even numbered cycles suggest that the solar meridional flows may transport magnetic flux across the solar equator and potentially responsible for all the above relationships . </S>"
