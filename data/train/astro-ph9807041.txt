    "gravitational weak lensing by large scale structures is known to be a promising aproach to probe the mass distribution in the universe .",
    "gravitational lensing by cluster of galaxies already gave new insights about the cluster mass and their 2d mass distribution whereas observation of lensing by large scale structure is only at its beginning ( @xcite ) .",
    "its potential scientific impact on the knowledge of the cosmological parameters and the mass power spectrum pionnered by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , has been developped by many authors ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one may also be interested in comparing the mass maps reconstructed from weak lensing and the galaxy catalogues ( i.e. the mass and the light distributions ) in order to probe the so - called bias relation .",
    "galaxy catalogues ( via high order statistic ) and velocity fields being the standard ways to probe the bias , a method able to _ see _ directly the mass , like gravitational lensing , may play a role . in the following some clues about the measurement of bias using gravitational lensing",
    "will be exposed , most of them are detailed in @xcite .",
    "biasing theory has known recently a raise of interest because of the growing evidences that it is not trivial . however , in order to give some insights on the method , local linear biasing relation is used as a basis along this paper , and the extension to non trivial biasing is let for a forthcoming paper @xcite .    the basic idea is to probe the bias by measuring the correlation @xmath0 between the projected density contrast of a set of foreground galaxies and the shear of background galaxies .",
    "the difficulty with the gravitational lensing is that it gives the projected mass along the line of sight , whereas the 3d mass field is required in order to constrain the bias , in particular if we wish to investigate its redshift evolution .",
    "fortunately the @xmath1 statistic introduced by @xcite gives the possibility to deproject the observed mass distribution . to understand how it is possible ,",
    "let us write the correlation function @xmath0 explicitly @xcite , @xmath2 @xmath3 is the convergence smoothed with a compensated filter of size @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the projected density contrast of the foreground galaxies smoothed with the same filter .",
    "@xmath6 is the linear bias parameter , @xmath7 is the comoving distance to a redshift @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the comoving angular diameter distance , and @xmath10 is the time - evolving 3-d mass power spectrum .",
    "@xmath11 is the density parameter , and @xmath12 is the cosmic expansion factor .",
    "the function @xmath13 depends on the redshift distribution of the sources @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the redshift distribution of the foreground galaxies .",
    "@xmath16 is the fourier transform of the compensated filter , which is very localised in the fourier space around the angular scale @xmath4 .",
    "if in addition a narrow redshift distribution is used for the foreground galaxies then the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ mn_def ] ) are almost reduced to a point in the @xmath17 plane , which is equivalent to a deprojection ( a single angular scale @xmath18 is observed at a given redshift @xmath19 ) .",
    "a useful estimator to probe the bias , independent on the power spectrum normalisation is , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dispersion of the smoothed projected density contrast of the foreground galaxies , @xmath22 in the case of linear theory , for a power law power spectrum and for a narrow foreground redshift distribution ( located around @xmath19 ) it is easy to show from eq.([mn_def ] ) and eq.([n2_def ] ) that eq.([r_def ] ) can be approximated by , @xmath23 which is a number depending only on the cosmological parameters , the biasing factor @xmath6 and the foreground and background redshift distributions .",
    "it does not depend on the power spectrum index and the smoothing angle @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that this is still true for a general power spectrum even in the non linear regime .",
    "the reason for this is that if the redshift integration in eq.([mn_def ] ) and eq.([n2_def ] ) are narrow enough , a general power spectrum can be approximated _ locally _ as a power law because of the narrow function @xmath16 . _",
    "locally _ here means in the @xmath17 space .",
    "an illustration of this is given if figure [ script_r.ps ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are plotted versus the smoothing angle @xmath4 for different cosmological models , and with the narrow foreground ] redshift distribution @xmath26 well localised around @xmath27 .",
    "the left plot shows the value of @xmath28 and the right plot the ratio @xmath29 .",
    "different linestyle correspond to different cosmological models as indicated on the left plot , thin lines are for the linear regime and thick lines for the non - linear regime .",
    "cdm - like power spectrum has been used .",
    "the power spectrum evolution has been extended into the non - linear regime via the peacock & dodds formula in @xcite .",
    "figure [ script_r.ps ] shows that @xmath24 is has a constant value to a percent accuracy over the scale range @xmath30 $ ] which only depends on the cosmological parameters , the bias ( at the redshift of the foregrounds ) and the redshift distributions whatever the power spectrum .",
    "calculations with various power spectra shows that @xmath24 changes by less than @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath24 values fitted to the @xmath11 dependence ( assuming a zero cosmological constant ) gives , @xmath32 where the proportionality constant and the exponent both depend on the redshift distributions according to eq.([r_approx ] ) .",
    "conjointly used with the velocity fields or any independent determination of @xmath11 , eq.([r_fit ] ) allows to determine the bias at the redshift of the foreground galaxies ( here roughly @xmath33 ) and at the scale @xmath4 from weak lensing data provided that the redshift distributions are known .",
    "preliminary investigations show that only the mean and the variance of these distributions are important even if they are skewed .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 defined above gives a direct estimate of the scale dependence of the bias , independent on the cosmology , the power spectrum and the redshift distributions . strictly speaking it gives the ratio of the fourier components of the bias at two different scales provided that the bias can be expressed as a convolution , @xmath35 ( linear non - local non - stochastic biasing sheme ) .",
    "a signal to noise analysis shows that assuming that @xmath36 is perfectly known ( from the future big galaxy surveys for instance ) , a lensing survey of @xmath37 degrees ( with 4 hours exposure depth ) should be able to detect a bias scale variation of @xmath38 or more in the @xmath39 $ ] scale range .",
    "gravitational lensing can probe the bias relation between mass and light distributions .",
    "the simultaneous use of a narrow foreground redshift distribution and a compensated filter permits to _ deproject _ the observed mass distribution and to recover the redshift and scale dependence of the bias using eq.([r_fit ] ) and the estimator @xmath34 .",
    "redshift distorsion effects are not a problem in this method since the foreground redshift range is large enough do dilute these effects , and on the other hand , it is small enough to assume that a given angular scale corresponds to the physical scale at which the bias is probed . of course , the statistical bias properties are assumed to remain unchanged within the foreground galaxies redshift interval .    obviously the biasing sheme adopted in this paper is too simple and should be extended to non - linear , stochastic and non - local biasing .",
    "one can hope to use weak lensing jointly with galaxy catalogues and velocity fields to separate these features and try to build a consistent bias picture .",
