    "every major change in cellular systems involves mechanical movement at a single molecule level .",
    "recent advances in single molecule force spectroscopy ( smfs ) _ e.g _ optical tweezers , atomic force microscope , _ etc .",
    "_ have allowed cellular processes to be examined at the single molecule level @xcite . moreover , by applying a force of the order of pn on an isolated protein in vitro , the response of the force has been studied in order to understand the elastic , structural and functional properties of proteins @xcite .",
    "modeling of proteins using simplified interactions amenable to statistical mechanics analysis have been used extensively to theoretically understand the outcomes of these experiments @xcite . among the theoretical approaches lattice models despite their simplicity ,",
    "have proved to be quite predictive and have provided much important information about cellular processes @xcite .",
    "new challenges have arisen in the area of protein folding when removed from an artificial , controlled environment in vitro and relocated to the cellular environment @xcite .",
    "cells have a very crowded environment because they are composed of many different kinds of biomolecules that may occupy a large fraction ( @xmath0 ) of the total volume ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this condition leads to a phenomenon called  volume exclusion \" which is caused by the steric repulsion between different molecules @xcite .",
    "it is now known that molecular crowding can influence the stability , dynamics and function of proteins .",
    "thus far , in theoretical modeling , the cellular environment has been considered as homogeneous with each monomer ( amino acid ) interacting with all its nearest neighbors @xcite , of which there is a fixed number for each given lattice . in vivo , the cellular environment and the interactions involved in the stability of proteins are no longer homogeneous .",
    "it is essential to somehow model this disordered media say via the introduction of randomness into the connectivity of the underlying lattice .",
    "linear polymer chains trapped in a porous ( random ) media have been studied in detail because of the technological importance in filtration , gel permeation chromatography etc .",
    "however , the response of a polymer to a force remains an elusive problem which has thus far not been studied in detail .     as seen in the cell .",
    "one end of the polymer chain is kept fixed while a force @xmath1 is applied at the other end .",
    "dashed line corresponds to nearest neighbor attractive interaction among monomers .",
    ", width=336 ]    the aim of this paper is to study the effect of an applied force on a polymer in an artificially reproduced environment with molecular crowding similar to what is observed in a cell . in general the effect of the force on the reaction co - ordinate ( end - to - end distance ) @xcite",
    "is mainly determined by the competition between a loss of configurational entropy and a gain in internal energy due to the stretching of the protein caused by the applied force .",
    "the confinement of the proteins to a restricted portion of a cell leads to a further loss in entropy because of the molecular crowding and this may affect the behavior of the proteins . since smfs experiments are performed on proteins with only a few monomers we expect that modeling the effect of a force on a _ finite _ chain in a disordered environment may provide a better understanding of the unfolding process in vivo . in disordered media information about",
    "the dependence of the reaction co - ordinate and the probability distribution of the reaction co - ordinate on the parameters of the system is difficult to obtain analytically and one therefore has to resort to numerical studies .",
    "the freely jointed chain ( fjc ) and the worm like chain ( wlc ) ( developed for polymers ) @xcite are models which have been used extensively in order to understand the unfolding process and they correctly describe the force extension ( @xmath2 ) curves in the intermediate and high force regime .",
    "however , these models ignore excluded volume effects in their description . off",
    "lattice simulations do provide much important information about unfolding processes @xcite , but the exact density of states over the entire force regime are difficult to obtain . recently , exact and complete information about the density of states was obtained using exact enumeration technique .",
    "such studies can reproduce many qualitative features of the force induced transitions as well as reveal many new insights into the mechanisms governing the cellular processes @xcite .",
    "we model the polymer chain as self - attracting self - avoiding walks ( sasaws ) whose one end is kept fixed and a force is applied at the other end .",
    "the confinement imposed by molecular crowding has been modeled by generating site percolation clusters @xcite on the underlying square lattice of @xmath3 sites with a fixed density @xmath4 of available sites . in order to model the  volume exclusion \" , which is about @xmath5 of the total volume @xcite",
    ", we choose a density @xmath4 of available sites just above the percolation threshold @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it means that a sasaw can not access about @xmath5 of the volume as happens in the cell .",
    "the percolation process gives rise to a distribution of clusters , which will vary in size from isolated disorder sites upto clusters with an extent spanning the entire system .",
    "due to the randomness of the clusters the ground state of the system will not be fixed ( as is the case on a regular lattice ) , but may vary with each realization . because of the steric repulsion between the molecule of interest and the surrounding biomolecules @xcite , in the present model we do not consider interactions between the polymer and the disorder sites .",
    "the model can readily be extended to three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite .",
    "the qualitative nature of the @xmath2 curve should remain the same .",
    "but in the case of 3d lattices the density of states can be calculated exactly for walks of length up to only 20 steps and one therefore has to use other methods _",
    "e.g. _ monte carlo simulation @xcite , molecular dynamics @xcite etc . to study such systems .",
    "since molecular crowding is a dynamical phenomenon involving the appearance , disappearance and movement of voids , the internal structure of the cell changes continuously . to model this",
    "we perform an averaging over many realizations while keeping @xmath7 constant .",
    "this ensures that the concentration of the crowding agent does not change , but the internal structure may change as happens in the cell .",
    "since we are near to percolation threshold , every disorder realization constitutes the partition function which is non zero .",
    "the partition function of the @xmath8 realization of the disorder configuration may be written as    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the number of distinct conformations of walks of length @xmath11 in the @xmath12-th realization of the disordered with @xmath13 non - bonded nearest neighbor pairs and whose end - points are a distance @xmath14 apart .",
    "@xmath15 is the boltzmann weight for the force defined as @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the unit vector along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "@xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is the temperature .",
    "@xmath22 is the boltzmann weight of nearest neighbor interactions with energy @xmath23 . in the following , we set @xmath24 and focus our discussion on the force induced globule - coil transition on the percolative lattice . throughout this paper",
    "@xmath25 $ ] denotes an average over various realizations and @xmath26 denotes thermal averaging . in the present study",
    "we enumerate all possible walks of length @xmath27 steps on given percolation clusters using 15000 realizations ( @xmath28 ) of the percolation process . for the sake of comparison we also enumerate",
    "walks of the same length on the square lattice with no disorder .",
    "it has been shown in previous studies that the chain length considered here is sufficient to predict the correct qualitative behavior and while increasing the chain length yields better estimates of say the phase boundary the qualitative features of the phase - diagram remain the same@xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath29 corresponds to pure self - avoiding walks ( saws ) _ i.e. _ polymers in a good solvent @xcite .",
    "we reproduced the scaling proposed by blavatska and janke @xcite for saws on a percolation cluster as well as for the square lattice . in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) we plot @xmath30 with @xmath12 for two different sets ( 5000 each ) of realizations . in fig .",
    "2(c ) , we have plotted the histogram of @xmath31 . the resulting distributions overlap ( within statistical error bar ) with each other having a common peak .",
    "in studying properties of disordered systems one encounters two types of averages in the literature namely the annealed average and the quenched average @xcite . in the case of annealed averaging conformational changes in the disorder",
    "have time scales which are very fast compared to the motion of the polymers .",
    "therefore , in the annealed case , averaging has to be done over all possible conformations of the disorder implying that @xmath32 . in the case of",
    "quenched disorder the biopolymers unfold very fast compared to the conformational changes ( if any ) of the disorder sites .",
    "in fact neither type of averaging is entirely appropriate as far as the unfolding of a biopolymer in the presence of continuously moving crowding agents is concerned .",
    "it may be noted that unfolding takes place on time - scales on the order of micro seconds to a few seconds .",
    "in such a relatively short time span the internal structure of a cell can change substantially but not enough to access all possible conformations and hence increasing the number of realization toward the limit of infinity is not an experimental prerequisite . in view of the time scale involved in unfolding ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to averaging over a finite but large set of realizations which may roughly mimic a real system in vivo .",
    "the number of realizations considered here is almost twenty times more than previous studies @xcite .",
    "the approximate annealed average of the reaction co - ordinate in this case may be defined as    @xmath33\\rangle_d = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n_{tot } } \\sum_i \\sum_{(n_p , | x | ) }   x^{(i ) } c_n^{(i)}(n_p , | x |)u^{n_p } \\omega^{| x |}}{z}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 and the summation is over @xmath28 realizations of the disorder .",
    "it may be noted that in the limit @xmath32 the annealed average and the pure system will give the same results and the two summations of eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be interchanged . in this case",
    "there are roughly @xmath35 possible conformations and hence summation over all of them is computationally impossible .",
    "the suffix  d \" in eq .",
    "( 2 ) corresponds to an approximate annealed averaging that depends on the disorder realization .",
    "the quenched average of the reaction co - ordinate for the @xmath12-th realization is given by @xmath36 the sample average over eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be written as @xmath37 = \\sum_i \\langle x^{(i)}\\rangle_q / n_{tot}\\ ] ] which we call an average over quenched disorder .          in fig .",
    "3(a ) we show some of the representative plots of quenched averaged reaction coordinate obtained from eq .",
    "( 3 ) for different realizations . in fig .",
    "3(b ) we plot the extension versus the force for the approximate annealed disorder average ( @xmath38\\rangle_d$ ] ) and the sample averaged quenched disorder ( @xmath39 $ ] ) at low temperature ( @xmath40 ) . for the sake of completeness we also plot @xmath41 versus @xmath1 for the pure case at the same temperature . in the approximate annealed case",
    "we find multistep plateaus which are absent in the pure case .",
    "such plateaus have been observed in the pure case at much lower @xmath21 during force induced unfolding @xcite .",
    "it appears that disorder reduces the entropy of the system ( making the solvent poorer ) which causes the emergence of such plateaus .",
    "we expect qualitatively similar behavior for other sets of realizations with a finite @xmath28 and these plateaus will vanish and approach the pure case in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "notably every specific realization shows such plateaus , which are induced by the disorder .",
    "however sample averaging [ eq . ( 4 ) ] over quenched disorder [ eq .",
    "( 3 ) ] , smoothen the plateaus . at high temperature",
    "the entropy of the system is high enough that any effects of disorder vanish . as a consequence of this",
    "the force - extension curve overlaps with the pure case as can be seen from fig .",
    "3(c ) .",
    "it is known that in protein folding , the protein acquires a unique ( native ) conformation among a large number of conformations and many biological functions depend on this . however , in a  disordered protein \" @xcite there is no unique native conformation and diseases such as alzheimer are the result of that .",
    "in fact the ground state entropy of such molecules is comparatively larger than the native conformations ( unique in the case of a protein ) but much less than the entropy associated with the globule of the same length @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to have a reference calculation which predicts the shape of these curves in quasi - equilibrium in order to precisely estimate kinetic effects in the experiments or in molecular or langevin dynamics simulations [ 13 ] . in the case of polymers",
    "we find that the residual entropy of the globule on the percolation cluster is much less than the entropy of the globule ( pure case ) on the square lattice . moreover , on the percolation cluster , the number of interactions per monomer is not the same as on a pure square lattice and this induces a heterogeneity in interactions along the chain even for a homopolymer .",
    "the number of nearest neighbors in this case varies between 0 and 2 in comparison to the pure lattice where this number is always 2 . because of this the present model may give some intrinsic features close to such molecules because of the induced heterogeneity in the interaction .",
    "since atomic force microscopy ( afm ) works in the constant distance ensemble ( cde ) @xcite , we also calculate @xmath42 in the cde and plotted it against @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that the model presented here shows oscillations in the @xmath2 curve for the approximate annealed case .",
    "however , for the sample averaged quenched disorder and pure cases such oscillations are absent .      it has been shown that the probability distribution curves @xmath43 provide important information about cellular processes @xcite .",
    "@xmath43 can be calculated from the following expressions for the approximate annealed and averaged quenched cases : @xmath44 and @xmath45\\ ] ]        for the pure , approximate annealed and sample averaged quenched disorder cases , the probability distribution curves shown in figs .",
    "5 and 6 display qualitatively similar behavior at low and high forces with @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    "we find a peak position corresponding to the collapsed state . at high @xmath1",
    "it peaks around the stretched state .",
    "the collapse transition is of second order in two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite which can be seen from the probability distribution curve shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) for the pure case . near the transition point",
    "the peak broadens , which indicates that the transition is continuous ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) . however , in the approximate annealed case [ figs .",
    "6(a)-(l ) ] , one can see the emergence and disappearance of peaks for different @xmath1 at @xmath40 .",
    "with increasing @xmath1 we see that the height of one peak increases while others decrease .",
    "we find at many different forces that the height of two peaks ( at different positions ) becomes equal indicating the coexistence of two states .",
    "these features are observed for each and every realization of disorder .",
    "this gives the signature that the transition is no longer continuous .",
    "recently , yuan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the effect of concentration of dextran ( disorder sites ) which is quite below the @xmath7 on the mechanical stability of protein molecules .",
    "they found that average force increases with concentration in presence of crowding agents ( dextran ) .",
    "for the low concentration , force increases linearly , but above than @xmath48 concentration it is no more linear .",
    "our early calculation for small realization do show such behavior and we find that there is a crossover when concentration approaches to @xmath7 @xcite .        in this work we have reproduced most of the studied behavior of a polymer chain at force @xmath49 _",
    "e. g. _ scaling of the probability distribution curve ( saws ) for pure and disordered lattices @xcite .",
    "our results are also consistent with earlier studies , _ i.e _ at @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath14 is less than the pure case for approximate annealed averaging while greater for sample averaged quenched case ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) @xcite .",
    "the approximate annealed average in fact represents the typical effect of the quenched disorder case .",
    "however , entropy induced by sample averaging over quenched realization smoothens the reaction coordinate and we therefore observe a monotonic increasing effect in the force - extension curve .",
    "similar features have also been seen for individual disorder at high temperature where entropy smoothens such plateaus .",
    "we have modeled the unfolding process in a cell where the polymer is surrounded by non - interacting biomolecules .",
    "our results based on exact enumeration technique clearly show that disorder induces intermediate states because of the heterogeneity in the interaction .",
    "the occurrence of peaks of equal height in the probability distribution shows the coexistence of two states at different forces suggesting that the transition is discontinuous in the case of finite chains .",
    "this may be because the underlying structure ( percolation clusters ) is no longer a regular lattice but a fractal @xcite . at this stage long chain simulation",
    "is required to verify this .",
    "it is important to recall that experimentally observed coil - globule transition is also first order . in constant",
    "distance ensemble system probes local ground state and average of force is calculated from them .",
    "therefore , heterogeneity in non - bonded nearest neighbor interaction induced by disorder shows such strong oscillation in the f - x curve . at this stage additional work",
    "is needed to understand the effect of a force in the cellular environment .",
    "we thank d. dhar , s. m. bhattacharjee and k. p. n. murthy for many helpful discussions related to disorder averaging .",
    "we also thank i. jensen for critical reading of this paper and his comments .",
