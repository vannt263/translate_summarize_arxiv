    "although it is not clear whether 1d topological insulator truly exists , the inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires@xcite are considered as possible candidates based on the identification of the topological properties in the corresponding quantum well structures@xcite . here",
    ", the key feature is that the conduction band bottom of inas is lower than the valence band top of gasb , thus offering the possibility of band inversion , the characteristics of most topological insulators .",
    "further , for the nanowire to be insulating inside , a net fundamental gap must exist over the whole momentum space . in principle , such a gap can form through the anti - crossing of the electron and hole bands , and , if the ordering of these bands is inverted , then the fundamental gap is topologically nontrivial .",
    "experimentally , the observation of the helical edge state in the inas / gasb quantum well@xcite strongly suggests that a topologically nontrivial fundamental gap could also exist in the corresponding nanowire structures . on the other hand ,",

    "later , a quantum dot system has been realized with a gasb / inas core - shell nanowire and the effect of the interaction between electron quantum dot states and hole quantum dot states has been observed,@xcite indicating a clear occurrence of an energy overlap of inas conduction band states and gasb valence band states in the core - shell nanowire .",

    "[ fig : theory1 ] , three different types of energy gaps can , in principle , exist in an inas / gasb or a gasb / inas core - shell nanowire with band inversion : ( i ) the topologically nontrivial fundamental gap @xmath5 mentioned above , ( ii ) the hybridization gap @xmath6 resulting from the anti - crossing of the inverted electron and hole bands which , by definition , does not include gap between normally ordered states , and ( iii ) the effective gap @xmath7 , i.e. , the energy difference between the lowest electron - like band and the highest hole - like band at the @xmath8 point . in presence of band inversion , the effective gap becomes negative . here , of particular importance",
    "is the evolution of the hybridization gap with the structural parameters . since in the brillouin zone",
    "all hybridization gaps are formed only around individual points , they are often covered up by continuous band states elsewhere . to form a topologically nontrivial fundamental gap , therefore ,",
    "at least one of the hybridization gaps must remain open over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the electronic structure of the [ 001]-oriented inas / gasb and gasb / inas nanowires have been calculated by kishore _ _ et al.__@xcite these authors have explored the variation of the band structure as a function of the structural parameters , such as the radius of the core and the thickness of the shell .",
    "although it is not specifically targeted on the topological properties , some useful information can already be extracted from the work . however",
    ", a few important questions still remain open .",
    "first , the results reported so far are only for nanowires with the [ 001 ] orientation .",
    "it is not clear how they differ for nanowires oriented along other crystallographic directions , especially along the experimentally most relevant [ 111 ] direction .",
    "second , although a useful effective - gap map has been offered , of direct relevance to the topological properties is the topologically nontrivial fundamental gap for which no such a map has ever been presented .",
    "third , despite that both the inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires are experimentally accessible , most theoretical results are for the former type while the latter type has only been briefly discussed . therefore , more detailed studies of the gasb / inas core - shell nanowires are needed .",
    "it is the these important questions which have led to the work presented in this paper . in the paper",
    ", we use the @xmath1 theory to calculate the band structures of the inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires oriented along the [ 111 ] crystallographic direction .",
    "we analyze band inversion and the evolutions of the three types of energy gaps with the structural parameters .",
    "in particular , we offer detailed maps of the topologically nontrivial fundamental gaps over a wide range of structural parameters for both the inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires .",
    "a fully quantitative comparison between the results obtained for inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires reveals that although these two types of nanowires are qualitatively similar , the latter type is more favorable concerning topological properties .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as the following : in section [ sect : theory ] we briefly review the theoretical methodology of this work . the main results for the inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires are presented in sections and , respectively . in particular , we will illustrate in detail how the quantum size effects govern the formation of the topologically nontrivial fundamental gap .",
    "section is denoted to the evolution of the effective gap with the change in the geometrical structures .",
    "the sign of the effective gap serves as an indicator to the topological property of an existing fundamental gap . in section , we present a quantitative comparison between the topological properties of the inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires , and illustrate that the latter structure favors stronger electron - hole hybridization and is thus more preferred when concerning topological properties .",
    "finally , we conclude this work in section iv .",
    "various methods , including density - functional - theory ( dft)@xcite , tight - binding ( tb ) theory@xcite , and the @xmath1 theory@xcite , have been used to calculate the band structure of nanowires .",
    "of the three , dft is the only first - principle method which is free from any adjustable parameters , and therefore is often the best choice for electronic structure calculations .",
    "specific to the energy gap properties of the nanowires concerned in this work , however , dft is incompetent because it suffers from the well - known `` band gap problem '' , in that one major component of the fundamental gap , the derivative discontinuity of the exchange - correlation functional , is missing in the popular local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) .",
    "consequently , the dft band gaps are typically 0.1 ev to a few ev too small , with the range of the errors being already on the orders of magnitude larger than the topologically nontrivial fundamental gaps interested in this work . besides",
    ", dft is relatively costly .",
    "typically , its use is limited to a few hundred atoms which is often not sufficient to treat nanowires of realistic sizes .",
    "both tb and the @xmath1 theory can avoid the above dft problems at the expense of using empirical parameters .",
    "comparatively , @xmath1 is computationally more efficient , and is therefore particularly suited for the exploration of nanowires with large sizes . as the energy gaps involve both the valence band top and the conduction band bottom , the @xmath0 @xmath1 hamiltonian needs to be employed .",
    "the hamiltonian is formulated in the basis of the light hole ( lh ) , heavy hole ( hh ) , spin split - off ( so ) band states , as well as the conduction band electron ( el ) state .",
    "then , by including up and down spins the size of the basis set is doubled . in this work ,",
    "most band and luttinger parameters are taken from vurgaftman _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "the only exception is the kane energy @xmath9 of gasb which has been changed to 24.76 ev as suggested by foreman@xcite to avoid spurious solutions . throughout this paper ,",
    "the valence band offset ( vbo , see fig.[fig : theory1 ] ) is fixed to 0.56 ev@xcite and the energy zero is set at the top of the valence band of bulk inas .",
    "another slight difference from the earlier work is that we use hexagonal boundary for all nanowires which is more relevant to the experiments than a circular boundary used in the earlier work . for the purpose of study of the core - shell nanowires oriented along the [ 111 ]",
    "crystallographic direction in this work , the principal axis of the hamiltonian has to be rotated from the [ 001 ] to the [ 111 ] crystallographic direction .",
    "then the hamiltonian matrix is constructed by the finite element method .",
    "finally , through diagonalization , band energies and band state wave functions are obtained .",
    "all technical details can be found elsewhere.@xcite",
    "in this section , we focus on the evolutions of the topologically nontrivial fundamental gaps in the inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires with the structural parameters . in a core - shell nanowire , the total band structure is essentially formed by the two sets of bands from inas and gasb , subject to their mutual interactions and the effects of quantum confinement .",
    "especially , the conduction bands of inas and the valence bands of gasb are close in energy , and it is the hybridization between them which may offer the fundamental gap we are interested in . on the other hand , the valence bands of inas and the conduction bands of gasb are either too low or too high in energy and are essentially irrelevant to the formation of the gap . throughout this paper ,",
    "bands mostly of the inas characteristics are termed `` electron - like '' due to their positive parabola - like dispersions .",
    "similarly , bands mostly of gasb characteristics are termed `` hole - like '' due to their negative parabola - like dispersions .        by fixing the inas core radius while varying the gasb shell thickness , we have calculated the band structures of four representative nanowires .",

    "therefore , band ordering is normal and the effective gap is positive .",
    "the 0.09 ev energy gap , in this case also the fundamental gap , is topologically trivial .",

    "[ fig : inasgasb_gasbinas_kzwave](p ) to fig .",
    "[ fig : inasgasb_gasbinas_kzwave](t ) the top valence band state becomes more and more hole - like .",
    "the biggest differences between the two types of nanowires become clear when we separately look at the core and shell parts of the wave functions .",
    "let us consider the shell first .",
    "if the shell is formed from gasb , then the wave function in the shell is hole - like and shows a sharp circular ridge structure [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : inasgasb_gasbinas_kzwave](a ) ] , indicating that the hole - like state is very localized in the shell .",
    "alternatively , if the shell is formed from inas , then the wave function in the shell is electron - like and is much broader in space [ see , e.g. , fig.[fig : inasgasb_gasbinas_kzwave](o ) ] , implying that in the shell the inas electron - like wave function is more delocalized then the gasb hole - like wave function . for the core similar analysis can be performed .",
    "if the core is formed from inas , then the wave function in the core is electron - like and shows a strong peak around the center of the nanowire [ see e.g. fig.[fig : inasgasb_gasbinas_kzwave](e ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if the core is formed from gasb , then the wave function in the core is hole - like and does not show a peak but a dip around the center of the nanowire the wave function [ see e.g. fig.[fig : inasgasb_gasbinas_kzwave](k ) ] , so that the maximum of the hole state is pushed towards the boundary of the core .",
    "we note these features of the bottom conduction band state and the top valence band state found in the core region resemble closely the inherent properties of the freestanding [ 111]-oriented inas and gasb nanowires found in the previous studies.@xcite    it has now become clear that in the shell the electron - like state is more delocalized than the hole - like state , while in the core the opposite is true , i.e. , the hole - like state is more delocalized than the electron - like state .",
    "therefore , the electron - hole hybridization is stronger in a gasb / inas core - shell nanowire than in the corresponding inas / gasb core - shell nanowire .",
    "we emphasize that in other nanowire systems we have seen similar localization characteristics of the electron and hole states.@xcite we therefore speculate that putting the hole state into the core while the electron state in the shell may be a common rule for achieving more robust topologically nontrivial properties in many types of core - shell nanowires .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed study the properties of the energy gaps , especially the topological nature of the fundamental gaps , of the [ 111]-oriented inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires .",
    "the evolutions of the energy gaps with the structural parameters are shown to be dominantly governed by the quantum size effects . with a fixed core radius , a net , topologically nontrivial fundamental gap exists only in a finite range of intermediate shell thickness , which is true for both inas / gasb and gasb / inas core - shell nanowires .",
    "we have offered detailed maps of the topologically nontrivial fundamental gaps over a wide range of the structural parameters for the two types of core - shell nanowires .",
    "comparatively , we find the electron - hole hybridization is stronger in the gasb / inas nanowires due to the more delocalized features of the electron and hole wave functions in the shell and the core , respectively .",
    "this explains the larger size of the maximum topologically nontrivial fundamental gap , as well as the persistence of the gap within a wider range of structural parameters in the gasb / inas core - shell nanowires .",
    "since the similar localization characteristics of the conduction band electron wave functions and the valence band hole wave functions exist in other types of iii - v semiconductor nanowires , it could be used as a general guidance to put the hole - like state into the core while the electron - like state in the shell in constructing a topological core - shell nanowire with a large and robust topologically nontrivial fundamental gap .",
