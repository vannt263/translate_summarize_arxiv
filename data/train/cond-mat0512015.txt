    "burst avalanches play an important role in characterising the fracture - failure phenomena @xcite .",
    "when a weak element in a loaded material fails , the increased stress on the remaining elements may cause further failures , and thereby give a failure avalanche in which several elements fail simultaneously . with further increase in the load",
    "new avalanches occur .",
    "the statistics of such avalanches during the entire failure process explore the nature of correlations developed within the system . from the experimental point of view , failure avalanches are the only measurable quantity during the fracture - failure process of composite materials @xcite . under quasi - static loading",
    "the system , with some internal load redistribution mechanism , gradually approaches the global failure point .",
    "such damage and fracture of materials are of immense interest due to their economic and human costs .",
    "therefore , a fundamental challenge is to find methods for providing signals that warn of imminent global failure .",
    "this is of uttermost importance in , e.g. , the diamond mining industry where sudden failure of a mine is always catastrophic .",
    "these mines are under continuous acoustic surveillance , but at present there is no meaningful acoustic signature of imminent disaster .",
    "the same type of question is of course central to earthquake prediction @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will study crossover behavior of failure avalanches in the context of two very different models where the system gradually approaches global failure through several intermediate failure events .",
    "we find that if a histogram of the number of elements failing simultaneously is recorded , it follows a power law with an exponent that crosses over from one value to a very different value when the system is close to global failure .",
    "this crossover is , then , the signature of imminent breakdown .",
    "the first system studied here is a bundle of many fibers @xcite with stochastically distributed fiber strengths .",
    "this model is sufficiently simple that an analytic treatment is feasible @xcite .",
    "the second system is a fuse model @xcite , a two - dimensional lattice in which the bonds are fuses , i.e. , ohmic resistors with stochastically distributed threshold values .",
    "this model must be analyzed numerically .",
    "both models exhibit similar crossovers as signal of imminent breakdown .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present numerical evidence for the crossover in the fiber bundle model , backed up by analytic derivations .",
    "we pay particular attention to the burst properties just before complete breakdown .",
    "cascading failures in a fuse model is the theme of section iii .",
    "a bundle of many fibers with stochastically distributed fiber strengths , and clamped at both ends , is a much - studied model @xcite for failure avalanches . in its classical version ,",
    "a ruptured fiber carries no load and the increased stresses caused by a failed element are shared equally by all the surviving fibers .",
    "the maximal loads @xmath8 that the fibers @xmath9 are able to carry are picked independently with a probability density @xmath10 : @xmath11 a main result for this model is that under mild restrictions on the fiber strength distribution the expected number @xmath0 of burst avalanches in which @xmath1 fibers fail simultaneously is governed by a universal power law @xcite@xmath12 for large @xmath1 , with @xmath5 .",
    "however , we will show that when the whole bundle is close to breaking down the exponent crosses over to a lower value . such a complete breakdown can be estimated as follows :",
    "the force @xmath13 that the bundle is able to withstand when all fibers with strengths less than @xmath14 have ruptured , is proportional to the number of surviving fibers times the strength , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the expected fraction of fibers with strengths exceeding @xmath14 . as an example , assume the threshold distribution @xmath10 to be uniform in an interval @xmath17 , @xmath18 in this case we obtain @xmath19 which has a maximum at @xmath20 . in general we call @xmath13 the _ average _ force and the value corresponding to the maximum of @xmath13 the _ critical _  threshold value @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath13 given by ( [ f ] ) were the actual force , the bundle would break down when @xmath14 reaches the value @xmath21 . by the existence of fluctuations , however , the maximum value of the force may actually occur at a slightly different ( probably higher ) value of @xmath14 .",

    "<S> composite materials , with statistically distributed threshold for breakdown of individual elements , are considered . during the failure process of such materials under external stress ( load or voltage ) , avalanches consisting of simultaneous rupture of several elements occur , with a distribution @xmath0 of the magnitude @xmath1 of such avalanches . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is typically a power law @xmath2 . for the systems we study here , </S>",
    "<S> a crossover behavior is seen between two power laws , with a small exponent @xmath3 in the vicinity of complete breakdown and a larger exponent @xmath3 for failures away from the breakdown point . </S>",
