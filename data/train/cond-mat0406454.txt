    "following the experimental observation of vortices in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , vortex dynamics has been a subject of intensive interest @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have been performed on the center - of - mass motion of the vortex core in the bulk of the condensate @xcite .",
    "references @xcite have studied the dynamics of the core taking into account the dissipation from the thermal cloud .",
    "dissipation causes the vortex to spiral out of the condensate giving it a finite lifetime in agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "once they reach the surface of the condensate , the vortices decay into surface excitations .",
    "it is also believed that vortices enter the condensate from the surface at the point when surface excitations become unstable @xcite .",
    "hence , it is worth investigating the details of the dynamics of a vortex in the surface region of the condensate .",
    "_ @xcite have pointed out that near the surface of the condensate , the quadratic trapping potential can be approximated by a potential that is linear in distances normal to the surface . as a result of this approximation",
    ", the equilibrium density profile will be also linear in distances normal to the surface of the condensate except for distances very close to the thomas - fermi surface .",
    "an immediate question then arises : how will the vortex move in such an inhomogeneous density background ?",
    "the fact that the density is linear makes it possible to perform analytical treatment to the problem provided that the size of the core of the vortex is much less than the distance over which the background density varies significantly .",
    "this question has been addressed extensively by anglin  @xcite , where the author used a boundary - layer theory to calculate both the density profile and phase of the vortex , from which he obtained the equilibrium velocity of the vortex .",
    "it turned out that the component of the velocity in the direction normal to the surface of the condensate vanishes , while the component parallel to the surface is a constant that depends on the distance between the core of the vortex and the surface . in this paper",
    "we address basically the same problem but using a variational calculation .",
    "the main aim is to demonstrate that the variational calculation performed here generates the previous knowledge about the vortex motion near the surface and captures the main features of it .",
    "we go one step ahead of previous works by obtaining a rather more accurate expression for the component of the vortex velocity parallel to the surface .",
    "furthermore , we show that , within few coherence lengths from the thomas - fermi surface , the vortex oscillates along the direction normal to the surface around a minimum point of an effective potential .",
    "these oscillations are coupled to its motion parallel to the surface and disappear when the vortex is away from the surface .    in our variational calculation",
    "we use an ansatz wavefunction that takes into account the equilibrium density profile and phase of both the background and the vortex .",
    "the variational parameters are the coordinates of the vortex core and the center - of - mass velocity components normal to the surface of the condensate and parallel to it .",
    "the equations of motion for these parameters are then derived from a lagrangian that corresponds to the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation .    using a linear density profile for",
    "the background is an approximation that breaks down at the thomas - fermi surface .",
    "our variational calculation is , thus , expected to be accurate only away from the thomas - fermi surface .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the internal dynamics of the core of the vortex .",
    "this is also justified away from the thomas - fermi surface where the size of the core of the vortex is almost constant .    in the following ,",
    "we start , in subsection  [ sub1 ] , by writing down the ansatz wavefunction . using this wavefunction",

    "we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the dynamics of the time - dependent bose - einstein condensate is described by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath0\\psi({\\bf r^\\prime},t)=i\\hbar{\\partial\\over\\partial t}\\psi({\\bf r^\\prime},t)\\;. \\label{gp}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the effective two - particle interaction which is proportional to the @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath3 according to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of an atom , and @xmath6 is the equilibrium chemical potential .",
    "the harmonic trapping potential @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the characteristic frequency of the trap . here",
    ", we take for simplicity @xmath7 to be isotropic . for distances near the surface of the condensate ,",
    "the quadratic trapping potential @xmath7 can be approximated by a linear potential @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a coordinate normal to the surface of the condensate , @xmath12 is the thomas - fermi radius given by @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a force constant .",
    "the last equation is obtained by using the transformation @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "this suggests a planner geometry in which the surface of the condensate is approximated by an infinite plane .",
    "the @xmath11-coordinate will be normal to the plane while the @xmath16 and @xmath17 coordinates will be parallel to it .",

    "it should be noted that the angle @xmath32 defined in this paper is the complement of that defined in ref .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig6 ] , we plot the vortex coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath63 versus time .",
    "these two figures show that while the vortex is moving with a constant velocity in the @xmath16-direction , it oscillates in the @xmath11-direction as predicted in the previous section .",

    "the average value of @xmath145 in this figure agrees with the thomas - fermi estimate as explained in subsection  [ sub3 ] .",
    "in the previous section , we performed the calculation using the thomas - fermi approximation for the background density and neglected the dynamics of the size of the core .",
    "it is clear now that this is indeed justified here .",
    "we have shown that our variational calculation describes at least qualitatively the motion of a vortex near the surface of a bose - einstein condensate , and generates results that agree with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "these qualitative results were then supported and quantified using a numerical simulation of the vortex motion .",
    "one of the main findings of this work is eq .",

    "( [ vy2 ] ) can be used for both small and large @xmath177 , unlike the result of anglin  @xcite which is accurate only for large @xmath177 .",
    "another main result of this work is that , if the vortex is moving within few coherence lengths @xmath145 from the thomas - fermi surface , it will have an oscillatory component of its velocity in the direction normal to the surface .",
    "these oscillations disappear for @xmath72 and the vortex will have only the @xmath16-component of the velocity . to further understand the physics of these oscillations ,",
    "we have shown in subsection  [ sub2 ] that the vortex _ feels _ an effective potential that is a function of @xmath35 and has local minimum for negative values of @xmath35 . this effective potential is composed mainly of a sum of a mean - field - energy and a trapping potential energy part as shown in eq .",
    "( [ defunc4 ] ) .",
    "these two parts compete such that the effective potential has a minimum at @xmath178 .",
    "using a collective coordinates approach , we have shown that the vortex oscillates around this minimum with a frequency @xmath179 . as discussed in subsection  [ sub2 ] , this frequency is of order less than @xmath180 .",
    "both this frequency and the @xmath35-dependent part of @xmath91 vanish for large @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the vortex oscillations will disappear away from the surface of the condensate and will be noticeable only when @xmath181 is not negligible . to the best of our knowledge , these oscillations are predicted here for the first time . as a possible alternative explanation to these vortex oscillations near the surface , we mention the possibility that the vortex being dragged by a collective or surface wave . in our numerical procedure ,",
    "the evolution in imaginary time which generates the initial state for the real time evolution , may include some excitations of collective modes .",
    "further investigation is needed to verify this argument .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the energy of a vortex near the thomas - fermi surface is not infrared divergent as in the bulk .",
    "this is so since the vortex is localized to within its distance from the surface . to avoid these infrared divergencies in the energy",
