    "the electronic and/or magnetic properties of the low - dimensional interacting electrons have attracted great interest in researches of materials , such as the quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) organic compounds and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) high-@xmath0 cuprates , where a variety of generalized hubbard - type models have been introduced.@xcite for the 1d case , a concept of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) has been widely accepted and intensively used not only for the descriptions on the low - energy and long - distance behaviors of the critical systems,@xcite but also for the prediction of its instabilities to , for instance , various types of density - wave phases observed in the models.@xcite    the 1d hubbard model with an alternating potential ( also called the ionic hubbard model ) is one of the models for the @xmath1-electron charge - transfer organic materials , such as ttf - chloranil,@xcite and/or the ferroelectric transition metal oxides as batio@xmath2.@xcite it is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 annihilates an @xmath5-spin electron ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) on the @xmath8th site and the number operator @xmath9 and @xmath10 . while @xmath11 and @xmath12 terms stand for the electron transfer among sites and the coulomb repulsion on the same site , respectively , the @xmath13 term represents an energy difference between the donor and acceptor molecules ( or between the cation and oxygen atoms ) , and it introduces ionicity effects into the correlated electron systems ( we set @xmath14 in the following discussion ) .",
    "the understandings on the model have been accumulated in the literature , where the theoretical investigations including numerical calculations have been performed mainly at the half filling : nagaosa and takimoto calculated the magnetic and charge - transfer gaps as functions of @xmath13 ( @xmath12 fixed ) by using the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation.@xcite resta and sorella , using the exact - diagonalization calculations of finite size systems , reported , for instance , the divergence of the average dynamical charge.@xcite by applying the renormalization - group ( rg ) method to the bosonized hamiltonian , tsuchiizu and suzumura estimated a boundary line between the mott insulator ( mi ) and a band insulator ( bi ) phases in the weak - coupling regions.@xcite on the other hand , fabrizio , gogolin , and nersesyan ( fgn ) predicted an existence of the `` spontaneously dimerized insulator '' ( sdi ) phase between them.@xcite after their proposal , various numerical calculation methods have been so far applied to confirm it : wilkens and martin performed the qmc simulations to evaluate , e.g. , the bond order parameter , and reported the transition between the bi and sdi phases and stated an absence of mi phase for @xmath15.@xcite by the combined use of the method of topological transitions ( jumps in charge and spin berry phases)@xcite and the method of crossing excitation levels , torio _ et al . _ provided a global ground - state phase diagram , which is in accord with the fgn scenario.@xcite and an existence of the sdi phase for all @xmath16 regions was first exhibited there .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations @xcite have been performed by several groups .",
    "for instance , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ provided the data on the structure factors of relevant order parameters in the weak- and intermediate - coupling region , which supports an existence of intermediate sdi phase between the bi and mi phases.@xcite on one hand , kampf _ et al .",
    "_ estimated the excitation gaps up to 512-site system and found the boundary of the bi phase while the existence of the second boundary was not resolved.@xcite therefore , some controversy as well as points of agreement exists in these recent investigations .    in this paper using the standard numerical techniques , we shall provide both the global structure of the ground - state phase diagram and the evidences to show the criticalities of the massless spin and charge parts .",
    "for this purpose , it is worthy of noting that the fgn scenario consists of two types of instabilities commonly observed in the tll , i.e. , the transition with the su(2)-symmetric gaussian criticality in the spin part , and that with the 2d - ising criticality in the charge part ( see sec .  [ sec_groun ] ) .",
    "furthermore , these types of phase transitions have been numerically treated by the level - crossing ( lc ) method , and the phenomenological renormalization - group ( prg ) method.@xcite the lc method has been applied to the frustrated xxz chain,@xcite and also used in the research of higher-@xmath17 spin chains,@xcite spin ladders,@xcite and 1d correlated electron systems.@xcite the advantage of using the lc method is not restricted to its accuracy in estimating the continuous phase transition points including the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type one ; it also provides a means to check their criticalities ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_numer]).@xcite both of these are important in order to settle the controversy mentioned above , and , in fact , the precise estimation of the spin - gap transition point of the @xmath18 @xmath19-@xmath20 chain was first given by the lc method,@xcite while numerical investigations including the dmrg work were performed . on the other hand ,",
    "the prg method is also a reliable numerical approach to determine second - order phase transition point , especially for the 2d - ising transition where the lc method is not available .",
    "analysis based on the prg method for the 2d - ising transition is successful in the spin systems.@xcite furthermore , one of the authors treated the 2d - ising transition in the @xmath18 @xmath19-@xmath20 model under a staggered magnetic field , where the critical phenomena in the vicinity of the phase boundary line were argued.@xcite therefore , based on these recent developments , we shall perform the numerical calculations ; especially , to our knowledge , this is the first time that the prg method successfully applied to the 2d - ising transition observed in one part of the two - component systems like the interacting electrons .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_groun ] , we shall briefly refer to the effective theory based on the bosonized hamiltonian and order parameters of expected density - wave phases , and mention the fgn scenario . in sec .",
    "[ sec_numer ] , we explain procedures of the numerical calculation to determine transition lines , where connections between the methods and instabilities of the tll systems will be explained . after that , we shall give a ground - state phase diagram in whole parameter region .",
    "furthermore , to confirm the criticalities and to serve a reliability of our calculations , we check the consistency of excitation levels in finite - size systems .",

    "this is qualitatively in accord with the perturbation calculation in the strong - coupling region,@xcite and leads to the sdi phase with the long - range bcdw order ( the second row ) .",
    "further with the increase of @xmath13 , a transition in the charge part occurs on a separatrix @xmath47 between two different types of charge - gap states .",

    "note that torio _",
    "_ used the crossing of these excitation levels for the determination of the mi - sdi transition,@xcite while the consistency check of the levels to confirm the universality of transition is still absent .",

    "<S> lett . * 83 * , 2014 ( 1999 ) ] : we confirm the existence of the spontaneously dimerized phase as an intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> further we provide numerical evidences to check the criticalities on the phase boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we perform the finite - size - scaling analysis of the excitation gap to show the two - dimensional ising transition in the charge part . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the dimerized phase survives in the strong - coupling limit , which is one of the resultants of competition between the ionicity and correlation effects . </S>"
