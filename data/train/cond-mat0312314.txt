    "it is gradually becoming clearer that , while spin fluctuations are usually considered for electron mechanisms of high - tc superconductivity , charge fluctuations may possibly play essential roles in some of the unconventional superconductors . among these are organic metals such as @xmath8-(bedt - ttf)@xmath9x@xcite or ( bedt - ttf)@xmath10cl@xmath92h@xmath9o@xcite that exhibit superconductivity sitting adjacent to the charge density wave(cdw ) in the phase diagram .",
    "this suggests that charge fluctuations can mediate pairing as well , just as the spin - fluctuation - mediated pairing@xcite can appear adjacent to the spin density wave(sdw ) phase as in the cuprates and some of the organic superconductors like @xmath11-(bedt - ttf)@xmath9x .",
    "studies for the pairing mediated by charge fluctuations have been rather scant .",
    "et al . _ have shown , with the random phase approximation , that @xmath3 pairing gives way to @xmath2 in a three - dimensional cubic lattice when charge fluctuations become large with the introduction of the off - site interaction.@xcite however , systematic studies are yet to come for the charge fluctuations , in contrast to the spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity for which favorable situations for its occurrence has been extensively discussed@xcite .",
    "there is in fact one proposal in the context of the spin - triplet superconductivity in a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) organic metal ( tmtsf)@xmath9pf@xmath12 : three of the present authors have proposed a  generic phase diagram \" in which the dominant pairing symmetry changes as @xmath6 as the charge fluctuation becomes stronger@xcite . the physical background is as follows : triplet pairing is very hard to be realized to start with , for the reasons identified in ref.@xcite , where the primary one is the strength of the pairing interaction for triplets being only 1/3 of that for singlets .",
    "the situation can be reverted when charge fluctuations are dominant as discussed in kuroki _",
    "et al._@xcite , but the charge fluctuation was treated phenomenologically there , so a microscopic study is highly desirable .",
    "namely , while spin fluctuations dominate over charge fluctuations when the electron - electron interaction is short - ranged ( as in the hubbard model ) , charge fluctuations should become more intense as we increase the range of the interaction .",
    "the problem becomes especially intriguing when charge and spin fluctuations coexist , since they may induce quantum phase transitions among different pairing symmetries .",
    "this is exactly our motivation here to study the effect of strong charge fluctuations by adopting the extended hubbard model , as a simplest one in which we can control the relative magnitude of the charge fluctuation by varying the off - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "the extended hubbard model has been studied , primarily for specific charge densities @xmath1 , e.g. , half - filling or quarter filling , by means of quantum monte carlo method@xcite , weak coupling theory@xcite , mean - field approximation@xcite , second - order perturbation@xcite , random phase approximation@xcite , fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation@xcite , slave - boson technique@xcite , bosonization and renormalization group@xcite .",
    "however , the phase diagram of the _ two - dimensional extended hubbard model against @xmath1 and @xmath0 _ has yet to be obtained .",
    "here we have determined the symmetry of the dominant pairing in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space for the extended hubbard model by focusing on the case of isotropic or anisotropic square lattice , since many of unconventional superconductors are two - dimensional(2d ) or quasi - one - dimensional(1d ) .",
    "we adopt the flex developed by bickers _",
    "et al._@xcite , which is a renormalized perturbation scheme to study pairing instabilities when exchange of spin and charge fluctuations are considered as dominant diagrams .",
    "although this is an approximation , we can explore the tendencies for pairing when the system parameters are varied .",
    "we find that ( i ) there exists a phase transition between @xmath2 and @xmath3 pairing symmetries , ( ii ) triplet @xmath4-pairing appears in between the @xmath3 and cdw phases for intermediate @xmath5 and large @xmath0 , and ( iii ) for anisotropic cases the pairing symmetry changes , in agreement with the generic phase diagram@xcite , as @xmath6 when @xmath0 ( hence the charge fluctuations ) are increased .",
    "origin of all these has been identified as the structure in the charge and spin susceptibilities , which can have peaks habitating at segregated positions in @xmath7 space .",
    "let us start with the extended hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath13    in the standard notation on a tetragonal lattice depicted in fig .",

    "we have found that the @xmath37 dependence of @xmath38 and @xmath39 does not in fact affect @xmath40 and @xmath41 significantly .",
    "accordingly the peak position of @xmath42 is almost the same as that for @xmath43 term in the expression for @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , appearing in the last lines in eqs.([s],[t ] ) respectively , are constant terms involving @xmath46 and @xmath0 , @xmath47    when the off - site interaction @xmath0 is introduced all the vertices ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) as well as the susceptibilities become @xmath50 matrices for the lattice coordination number @xmath51 for the square lattice ) .",
    "let us first display the obtained phase diagram against @xmath0 and the band filling @xmath1 for the square lattice in fig.[phase ] . the phase diagram is drawn by assuming that the pairing instability that has the largest @xmath21 in liashberg s equation , calculated at @xmath24 here , has the highest transition temperature , because , with the present complexity of the model , it is difficult to extend the flex calculation to lower temperatures . while the value of @xmath21 for @xmath24 is still much smaller than unity ( see below ) , it is expected that the order in which the values of @xmath21 for various phases appear do not change for @xmath52 . the density waves ( cdw or sdw )",
    "are identified as the region where the respective ( charge or spin ) susceptibility diverges ( at @xmath53 in the present calculation ) .",
    "the area of the cdw and sdw phases may expand at lower temperatures , but the phase diagram is not expected to change significantly .",
    "figure [ phase ] is thus obtained , with the on - site coulomb repulsion fixed at @xmath54 hereafter , and we immediately note that cdw , sdw , singlet superconductivity(sc ) , and triplet sc all appear on the @xmath55 plane .",
    "the phase diagram is reminiscent of that for one - dimensional extended hubbard model obtained with the tomonaga - luttinger theory@xcite .",
    "however , an essential difference is that @xmath46 or @xmath0 has to be negative ( attractive ) to realize sc phases in one dimension , while we are talking about the case when both @xmath46 and @xmath0 are repulsive in 2d .",
    "another comment is that in our calculation we can not treat the mott insulator , which should appear at n close enough to the half - filling @xmath56 .    before elaborating on the superconducting phases ,",
    "let us make a remark on density waves .",
    "intuitively , cdw should appear for strong enough @xmath0 , while we should have sdw for the band filling close enough to the half - filling .",
    "the boundary between cdw and sdw for @xmath57 is seen in the present result to fall upon a line representing @xmath58 , which agrees with a mean - field picture : in the cdw state where electrons doubly - occupy every other sites , each electron feels on average an on - site energy @xmath59 per electron , while in the sdw state each electron , singly - occupied , feels an off - site repulsion @xmath60 , so the sdw / cdw boundary corresponds to @xmath61.@xcite as for the wave vectors describing the cdw ( sdw ) ordering , they are as indicated by the peaks ( around @xmath62 ) in the charge ( spin ) susceptibilities , which are displayed below .",
    "a salient feature for superconducting phases in fig . [ phase ] is that a spin - triplet @xmath4-phase appears just below the cdw phase for an intermediate region of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath21 when @xmath0 is varied with a fixed @xmath63 is depicted in fig.[fst].@xcite figure [ f - wave ] shows the gap function in @xmath7 space for the @xmath4-wave , which should be called , more precisely , @xmath64 in the group theoretical representation .",
    "this has only one nodal line passing @xmath19 point , but may be called @xmath4 in that the gap function ( @xmath65 $ ] ) changes sign as @xmath66 around the fermi surface.@xcite      we can keep track of the origin of the spin - triplet instability by looking at the structure ( peak intensities and peak positions in @xmath7 space ) of the charge ( @xmath42 ) and spin ( @xmath67 ) susceptibilities ( static with matsubara frequency@xmath68 ) in fig .",
    "[ csdwf ] .",
    "the peak intensity of @xmath42 is seen to exceed that of @xmath67 as @xmath0 is increased . if we turn to the structure in @xmath7 space , @xmath42 and @xmath67 have similar peak positions . if we go back to eqs.([s]),([t ] ) , the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing interaction ( the first line on the right - hand side ) and the charge - fluctuation mediated one ( the second ) act destructively ( with opposite signs for the two terms in eq.([s ] ) ) for singlet pairing , whereas they act _ constructively _ for triplet pairing ( same signs in eq.([t ] ) ) .",
    "so we can expect the realization of triplet pairing ( @xmath69 ) for large enough charge - fluctuation mediated pairing interactions ( i.e. , for large enough @xmath0 ) _ provided @xmath42 and @xmath67 have common peak positions_.    physically , @xmath70 while @xmath71 when @xmath72 , so the nesting of the fermi surface ( which dominates @xmath31 ) determines the peaks of @xmath67 ( but _ not _ those of @xmath42 ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is switched on , @xmath73 and @xmath74 may have common peak positions , which is what is happening here .",
    "how the situation is altered for smaller @xmath1 for which @xmath2 pairing turns out to be dominant ? in fig.[csdw ] , which shows @xmath42 and @xmath67 for @xmath75 with @xmath76 , @xmath42 has a larger peak than @xmath67 does , but the peak positions of @xmath42 are _ distinct _ from those of @xmath67 .",
    "namely , while @xmath42 has peaks at four points around @xmath77 , @xmath67 has peaks that are shifted toward @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "now , as a basic property of liashberg s eq.([elia ] ) with eq.([s ] ) plugged , to realize a large @xmath21 requires that ( i ) the gap function @xmath17 must change sign ( across the typical pair - scattering momentum transfer @xmath80 ) to turn the originally repulsive spin - fluctuation - mediated interaction ( i.e. , the @xmath81 term with a positive coefficient , @xmath82 in eq.([s ] ) ) into an effective attraction in the gap equation , while ( ii ) @xmath17 must not change sign ( across the pair - scattering momentum transfer @xmath83 ) to make the originally attractive charge - fluctuation - mediated interaction ( the @xmath43 term with a negative coefficient , @xmath84 ) remain attractive .",
    "we can see in fig.[peak ] that @xmath2 pairing does satisfy the above condition . for @xmath1",
    "closer to half - filling , by contrast , @xmath67 becomes dominant with @xmath85 ( an arrow in fig.[f - wave ] ) , so @xmath3 is favored as usual .",
    "so the picture obtained here is that the pairing symmetry can change , even within the spin - singlet channel , when common peaks between @xmath67 and @xmath42 change into _ segregated _ peaks ( as @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 are changed ) .",
    "this is contrasted with the above case of triplet @xmath4 , for which a transition between singlet and triplet ( @xmath86 ) can occur with the common peaks between @xmath67 and @xmath42 throughout . for @xmath87 , merino _",
    "et al._@xcite and kobayashi _",
    "et al._@xcite have recently derived similar results using the slave - boson technique and rpa , respectively which are consistent with the present result .",
    "let us finally discuss the anisotropic ( quasi 1d ) case . while the original proposal made in ref.@xcite for the triplet ` @xmath4-wave ' pairing in ( tmtsf)@xmath9x ( where the symmetry refers to the warped fermi surface ; see fig.[1dsu ] below ) is for a quarter - filled case , the competition between the charge and spin fluctuations should become more stringent near half - filling , where @xmath46 introduces @xmath88 spin fluctuations while @xmath0 enhances @xmath88 charge fluctuations .",
    "thus the triplet pairing should dominate over singlet @xmath89 beyond some value of @xmath0 .",
    "note that the triplet gap function has to be @xmath4 rather than @xmath90 , since , with @xmath91 negative ( attractive ) , the gap has to have the same sign across the nesting vector @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes even larger , @xmath93 turns negative ( attractive ) , so that the singlet @xmath94 with no nodes on the fermi surface will take over .    in order to show that this prediction is indeed realized , we have performed a flex calculation on a quasi 1d lattice with @xmath95 . to represent the quasi 1d system we have here assumed that the off - site repulsion only acts between nearest neighbors along @xmath96 ( the conductive direction ) ,",
    "although this assumption does not qualitatively alter the result .",
    "figure [ 1dsu ] plots @xmath21 as a function of @xmath97 for @xmath98 , along with the forms of @xmath89 , @xmath4 , and @xmath94 gap functions .",
    "we can see that the dominant pairing changes as @xmath6 with @xmath0 , in an exact agreement with ref.@xcite .",
    "we have obtained the phase diagram for the 2d extended hubbard model with the flex approximation . we have found that @xmath4-wave pairing is favored for intermediate @xmath1 and large @xmath0 . in the more dilute regime ( @xmath99 ) the peak position of @xmath42 and @xmath67 is separated , and @xmath3 pairing gives way to @xmath2 .",
    "these are the consequences of how each pairing symmetry can exploit charge and spin fluctuations , and we end up with a picture that the pairing symmetry can change , even within the spin - singlet channel ( @xmath100 ) , when common peaks between @xmath67 and @xmath42 change into segregated peaks ( as @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 are changed ) , which is contrasted with the case of common peaks throughout with a transition triplet @xmath101 . in the anisotropic ( quasi - one - dimensional ) case , the dominant pairing gap function changes as @xmath6 with @xmath0 , which agrees with the phenomenological theory@xcite .    in a broad context",
    "it should be interesting to examine how @xmath0 ( hence the charge fluctuation mediated interaction ) can dominate the pairing symmetry in unconventional superconductors , although the nature of the pairing may be sensitively affected by the underlying band structure of each material .",
