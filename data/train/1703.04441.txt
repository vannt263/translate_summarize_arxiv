    "quantum systems are localized in a finite well - defined space area .",
    "this area may be determined by certain boundary conditions ( e.g. in quantum dots or quantum billiards ) or by self - organization ( e.g. in atomic nuclei ) .",
    "the shape of the nucleus is , indeed , an essential part of nuclear spectroscopic investigations and is characteristic of every nucleus . it may be spherical as well as oblate or prolate or even more complicated , see @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of quantum systems are studied usually by means of a hermitian hamilton operator @xmath0 , the eigenstates of which are discrete .",
    "due to the embedding of the system into a continuum of scattering wavefunctions , the lifetimes of its states become usually finite .",
    "this agrees with the experimentally well - known finite lifetime of the states of a quantum system which is described in the standard hermitian quantum theory by means of the tunneling mechanism .",
    "an exception are the well - known bound states in the continuum the lifetime of which is infinitely long .",
    "these states occur under special conditions and are described well in different papers for different systems , e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , the embedding of a quantum system into a continuum of scattering wavefunctions causes another effect which can , as a matter of principle , not be simulated in standard hermitian quantum theory : since every state of the system is coupled to the continuum , all the states of the system may mix via the environment .",
    "this so - called external mixing ( em ) of the states is a second - order process and occurs additionally to the well - known direct ( internal ) mixing of the states which is contained in the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "experimentally , an example of em has been provided a few years ago in a mesoscopic system .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that two distinct quantum states are coupled through a common continuum . in a further experiment ,",
    "the authors were able to show that em survives even under conditions of strongly nonequilibrium transport in the system @xcite .",
    "a possible em of quantum states is very seldom considered in theory since it is fully beyond hermitian theory .",
    "however , it can easily be taken into account when the properties of the system are described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "in such a case , em is involved explicitly in the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 , see @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the , at first glance , unexpected result has been found that em needs not to be considered when the system is embedded in a common environment of scattering wavefunctions .",
    "this result corresponds to the experience obtained from many numerical studies on realistic systems in which em is not at all considered .",
    "also the influence of the singular exceptional points ( ep ) is not involved in these standard calculations .    nevertheless , these results are not in contradiction with the statement of non - hermitian quantum physics that ep and em may influence , to a great extent , the spectroscopic properties of open quantum systems .",
    "the point is that eps cause nonlinear processes in their neighborhood @xcite which are able to compensate the contributions that arise from the em of the states via the common environment @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the cross section shows the same resonance structure in the one - channel case when calculated with eps and em or without them .",
    "the situation is however another one when the system is embedded not only in one common environment , but in several environments which exist independently of one another .",
    "an example of such a situation is the decay of a nuclear state into different states of the residual nucleus by emission of a nucleon .",
    "in such a case , we have the different widths @xmath2 ( called usually partial widths ) that characterize the decay of the state @xmath3 of the system in one of the open channels @xmath4 .",
    "the different channels are defined by the decay of the state @xmath3 into different states of the residual nucleus by emission of a nucleon .",
    "a channel is open when the energy difference between the state @xmath3 and the state of the residual nucleus is positive , i.e. when the emission of a particle is allowed .",
    "another example is the transmission through , e.g. , a quantum dot . in this case , at least two different environments exist , namely that of the entrance channel and that of the exit channel .",
    "several numerical studies performed with a non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath1 on the basis of the tight - binding model have shown interesting non - trivial results @xcite : the transmission probability is anticorrelated with the phase rigidity of the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian hamilton operator ( when averaged over energy in a certain energy window ) .",
    "that means it depends on internal properties of the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 .",
    "an enhancement of transmission through quantum dots or quantum billiards is found also in other studies , mostly by varying the coupling strength of the system to the environment . in @xcite ,",
    "complex scaling is used while in @xcite the formation of a superradiant state under certain conditions is considered . neither in @xcite nor in @xcite , the enhancement of the transmission",
    "is related to the existence of a special superradiant state ( that appears together with subradiant states ) .",
    "the enhancement of the transmission in these studies is rather caused by the internal properties of the eigenstates of the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath1 , above all by the properties of its eigenfunctions .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to find typical spectroscopic features of an open quantum system that is coupled to two environments , which are independent of one another . in sect .",
    "[ hamilt ] , we sketch the formalism used by us ; and in sect .",
    "[ num ] we show some typical numerical results .",
    "a discussion of the obtained results can be found in sect .",
    "[ disc ] while some conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "[ concl ] . here , we bring into focus a possible experimental test of non - hermitian quantum physics .",
    "to begin with , we sketch the features typical for an open quantum system embedded in one common continuum .",
    "details can be found in @xcite and , above all , in @xcite .",
    "they can be discussed by means of the @xmath6 non - hermitian matrix @xmath7 here , @xmath8 are two complex eigenvalues of the basic non - hermitian operator coupled to the environment @xmath9 ( called also channel @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 are the energies of the states @xmath3 and the @xmath11 are their widths .",
    "the @xmath12 stand for the coupling matrix elements of the two states via the common environment @xmath9 .",
    "they are complex where re(@xmath12 ) arises from the principal value integral and im(@xmath12 ) from the residuum @xcite .",
    "the complex eigenvalues @xmath13 of @xmath5 give the energies @xmath14 and widths @xmath15 of the states of the localized part of the system .    in ( [ ham2 ] ) ,",
    "a singular point may appear , the so - called ep , at which two eigenvalues of @xmath5 coalesce @xcite . at these points ,",
    "the two corresponding eigenfunctions are not orthogonal .",
    "instead @xmath16 according to analytical and numerical results @xcite .",
    "an ep is , according to its definition , related to the common environment in which the system is embedded . in other words",
    ", it is well defined under the condition that the system is embedded in only one continuum .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamilton operator are biorthogonal @xmath17 in the case of the symmetric @xmath6 hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , it is @xmath18 and the eigenfunctions should be normalized according to @xmath19 in order to smoothly describe the transition from a closed system with discrete states to a weakly open one with narrow resonance states . as a consequence of ( [ eif3 ] ) , the values of the standard expressions are changed , @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 furthermore , the phase rigidity which is a quantitative measure for the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions , @xmath23 while it approaches the value @xmath24 when an ep is approached .    additionally to the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] )",
    ", we will consider the non - hermitian matrix @xmath25 which describes the system without any mixing of its states via the environment .",
    "in other words , @xmath26 corresponds to vanishing em of the eigenstates .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath27 of @xmath5 can be represented in the set of eigenfunctions @xmath28 of @xmath29 , @xmath30 under the condition that the @xmath31 are normalized by @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 differ from the @xmath34 .",
    "they contain the information on the strength of em .",
    "the main features characteristic of open quantum systems are described well by the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "typical values related to the eigenfunctions are the phase rigidity ( [ eif7 ] ) and the contribution of em ( [ eif12 ] ) to their purity .",
    "all these values contain the influence of the environment .",
    "they are proven experimentally , for details see @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath35 may be rewritten into a schrdinger equation with source term @xcite , @xmath36 in this representation , the coupling @xmath37 of the states @xmath3 and @xmath38 of the localized system via the common environment of scattering wavefunctions ( em ) is contained in the source term of the schrdinger equation , for details see @xcite .",
    "far from eps , the coupling of the localized system to the environment influences the spectroscopic properties of the system only marginally @xcite .",
    "the influence is however nonvanishing also in this case , see e.g. the experimental results @xcite .",
    "in the neighborhood of eps , the coupling between system and environment causes according to mathematical studies nonlinear effects in the schrdinger equation ( [ eif11 ] ) , see @xcite . among others ,",
    "these effects lead to a conservation of the resonance structure of the cross section in the one - channel case which is unaffected by em and by the existence of eps .",
    "thus , the one - channel case can not be used in order to test the results of the non - hermitian formalism .",
    "let us consider the @xmath40 non - hermitian matrix @xmath41 here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the complex eigenvalues of the basic non - hermitian operator @xmath39 relative to channel @xmath9 and @xmath44 , respectively @xcite . usually @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath46 stand for the coupling matrix elements of the two states via the environment @xmath9 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath47 and eigenfunctions @xmath48 of ( [ ham22 ] ) are characterized by two numbers : the number @xmath3 of the state ( @xmath49 ) of the localized part of the system and the number @xmath4 of the channel ( @xmath50 ) , called environment , in which the system is embedded .",
    "usually , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . also the wave functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 differ from one another due to the em of the eigenstates via the environment @xmath9 and @xmath44 , respectively . that means , the system has four states , from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the two environments are different from and orthogonal to one another .",
    "further , the two eigenstates with equal @xmath3 and different @xmath4 arise from the same state @xmath3 of the localized part of the system .",
    "the zeros in the matrix ( [ ham22 ] ) express the corresponding fact that the two eigenstates @xmath3 relative to the two channels 1 and 2 of @xmath39 can not interact with one another .",
    "we mention here that the hamiltonian ( [ ham22 ] ) is formally the same as the hamiltonian ( 24 ) in @xcite .",
    "there is however a fundamental difference : in ( 24 ) in @xcite , the whole system is _ fully _ embedded into both environments @xmath55 and @xmath56 which both are of completely different nature and exist independently of one another .",
    "in contrast to this , the hamiltonian ( [ ham22 ] ) describes a system , the states of which are embedded partially in each of the two different environments .",
    "these two different environments are also independent of one another . they are , however , nothing but _ parts _ of the total environment .    without an ep in the considered parameter range in relation to both channels",
    ", we have @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this case is realized in the decay of nuclear states since their decay probability can be determined only when the decaying state is well isolated from other states .",
    "otherwise , new problems arise from the overlapping with other states @xcite .    under the influence of an ep relative to @xmath60 and ( or ) relative to @xmath61",
    ", the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions will be , however , different , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath62 in the corresponding parameter range .",
    "such a situation may occur in transmission through a quantum dot or quantum billiard @xcite .",
    "this case will be considered in detail in the following section .",
    "in analogy to ( [ ham0 ] ) , we will consider also the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath63 which describes the system without any mixing of its states via any environment .",
    "in other words , @xmath64 corresponds to vanishing em of the eigenstates via an environment .",
    "the mixing of the eigenstates of ( [ ham22 ] ) can be represented in a set of eigenfunctions of ( [ ham00 ] ) in complete analogy to the relation ( [ eif12 ] ) for two states coupled to one common environment .      using ( [ ham00 ] )",
    ", we can write down the schrdinger equation with source term for the two - channel case in analogy to ( [ eif11 ] ) for the one - channel case .",
    "the corresponding equation reads @xmath65 the source depends on the coupling of the system to both channels , i.e. on @xmath12 and on @xmath46 .    under the special condition @xmath66 , the source term of ( [ eif11s4 ] ) depends on the only value @xmath67 .",
    "hence it is similar to that of the one - channel case ( [ eif11 ] ) .",
    "the situation is completely different in the general case with two channels ( two environments ) in which @xmath68 .",
    "we will show results of numerical calculations in the following section .",
    "we repeat here that , according to their definition @xcite , eps occur only in the one - channel case , i.e. only in the two submatrices related to channel @xmath9 and channel @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "they are not defined in the @xmath40 matrix ( [ ham22 ] ) .",
    "however , the eps of the two submatrices in ( [ ham22 ] ) may influence the dynamics of the open two - channel system .",
    "the resonance structure of the @xmath69 matrix containing two resonance states , can be obtained from the expression @xmath70 which is derived in @xcite for the case that two resonance states are coupled to a common continuum of scattering wavefunctions , see also @xcite . the expression ( [ sm4 ] )",
    "is unitary .",
    "according to ( [ sm4 ] ) , the resonance structure of the cross section is determined exclusively by the spectroscopic values of the localized part of the system , i.e. by the eigenvalues @xmath71 of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the expression ( [ sm4 ] ) allows us therefore to receive reliable results also in the two - channel case and , moreover , when the phase rigidity of the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 is reduced , @xmath72 , and when the eigenfunctions of @xmath1 contain em , i.e. when they are mixed in the set of eigenfunctions @xmath28 of @xmath73 according to ( [ eif12 ] ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the @xmath69 matrix contains , generally , nonlinear effects which are caused by an em of the resonance states via the environment .",
    "the one - channel case does , however , not allow us to prove the existence of these nonlinear effects and of em , since the resonance structure of the cross section calculated with and without em is the same in this case @xcite .",
    "this result agrees , on the one hand , with the experience received from many different numerical studies in realistic cases which are performed without taking into account em . on the other hand , it is not in contradiction with the conclusions received from the study of non - hermitian physics of open quantum systems .    according to the results obtained in @xcite , the evolution of the system near to an ep is driven exclusively by the nonlinear source term of the schrdinger equation ( [ eif11 ] ) which describes the coupling of the localized part of the system to the common environment and is characteristic of the open quantum system embedded in one environment .",
    "the calculations in @xcite are performed without varying @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath37 can not be responsible for the width bifurcation occurring in these calculations under the influence of an ep . obviously , the nonlinear source term is the driving force .",
    "it is able , in the one - channel case , to largely conserve the resonance structure of the cross section .",
    "the conservation of the resonance structure of the cross section which is possible in the one - channel case , is expected to be impossible , generally , in the two - channel ( or more - channel ) case according to ( [ eif11s4 ] ) since , generally , @xmath74 .",
    "this gives the chance to test non - hermitian quantum physics by means of the two - channel case .",
    "we will provide numerical results and discuss their physical meaning in the following sections of the present paper .",
    "for illustration , we show in fig . [ fig1 ] a few typical numerical results for two states in the two - channel case .",
    "the results of the left column are obtained for the special case @xmath75 and those of the right column for the general case @xmath76 .",
    "the numerical results for the eigenvalue trajectories @xmath77 and the eigenfunction trajectories @xmath78 of the hamiltonian @xmath39 are obtained by starting from parameter - dependent energies @xmath79 and parameter - independent widths @xmath80 .",
    "we consider two different cases : in one case , the widths @xmath80 of the two states are equal , @xmath81 ( correspondingly to @xmath75 ) , while they are different from one another in the other case , @xmath82 .    the eigenvalue trajectories figs .",
    "[ fig1].a , b and [ fig1].f , g , respectively , show two eps between which the widths @xmath83 bifurcate . at the critical parameter value @xmath84 width bifurcation is maximum . here",
    "the phase rigidity approaches the value @xmath9 ( figs .",
    "[ fig1].d and [ fig1].i ) , meaning that two states become ( almost ) orthogonal at this parameter value .",
    "the em of the states via the continuum can not be neglected at this parameter value ( figs .",
    "[ fig1].e and [ fig1].j ) .",
    "while the eigenvalue trajectories of @xmath39 are influenced by an ep mainly in its very neighborhood , the eigenfunction trajectories are influenced in a comparably large parameter range .",
    "this can be seen , above all , in the phase rigidity ( figs .",
    "[ fig1].c , d , h , i ) which is a quantitative measure for the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions of @xmath39 .",
    "this holds true in the one - channel case @xcite as well as in the two - channel case considered in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "although an ep is defined in relation to only one channel , a hint to its position can be seen in its neighborhood in the eigenfunctions of @xmath39 : the phase rigidity @xmath85 decreases , indeed , at the position of an ep .",
    "it does however not approach the value zero ( figs .",
    "[ fig1].c and [ fig1].h ) .",
    "this is true not only when @xmath81 but also when @xmath86 .",
    "similar results are obtained by starting from parameter - independent energies @xmath79 and parameter - dependent widths @xmath80 . in difference to the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the eigenvalues show , in this case , level repulsion ( appearing in the @xmath87 ) between the two eps , while the widths @xmath83 of the two states are the same in this parameter range .",
    "these results correspond to those obtained in the one - channel case @xcite .",
    "interesting information on the spectroscopic properties of the localized part of the system is contained in the resonance structure of the cross section which can be observed experimentally .",
    "we consider the transition from channel @xmath9 to channel @xmath44 which simulates transmission . using ( [ sm4 ] ) , we have calculated the resonance structure of the transmission at the critical parameter value @xmath88 and at two values of @xmath89 beyond the critical range .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the results without em ( corresponding to @xmath90 ) are shown .",
    "there appear four states , indeed , according to the results of analytical studies .",
    "characteristic of the resonance structure of the cross section of a two - level system coupled to _",
    "one _ channel is its double - hump structure around maximum width bifurcation @xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the transmission through a two - level system coupled to _ two _ channels in the analog parameter range around maximum width bifurcation .",
    "these figures illustrate that the double - hump structure of the cross section is restored in the transmission ( i.e. in the two - channel case ) under the influence of em .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( with different coupling strengths @xmath91 according to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] right ) , the double - hump structure around the maximum width distribution is very similar , indeed , to that of the cross section in the one - channel case ( solid black line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] compared to solid black line in fig .",
    "4.a in @xcite ) .",
    "the contour plot of the transmission is however much richer than the cross section in the one - channel case .",
    "this is reflected also in the dotted ( blue ) and dashed ( red ) lines of fig .",
    "[ fig3].a .",
    "more interesting are the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] corresponding to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] left with @xmath92 . here",
    ", the double - hump structure also appears .",
    "the bumps are however broadened in energy . due to this broadening ,",
    "the transmission is enhanced in a comparably large energy window . in this energy window ,",
    "the phase rigidity averaged over energy , is reduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the results shown in figs . [ fig1 ] to [ fig4 ] show very clearly that the mixing of the states via the environment ( em ) plays an important role in open quantum systems .",
    "this mixing is a second - order effect and does not appear in standard hermitian quantum physics . while its influence onto the spectroscopic properties of the localized part of the system far from singular points is usually small , it becomes important and determines the dynamics of the system in a finite neighborhood of singular points .",
    "such points are the well - known exceptional points ( eps ) .    according to mathematical studies @xcite ,",
    "eps are defined in relation to _",
    "one _ continuum .",
    "their physical meaning is studied therefore , up to now , mostly in systems that are embedded in one well - defined common environment .",
    "the results of many different papers show their meaning for the dynamical behavior of open quantum systems , among others for phase transitions . for references",
    "see the review @xcite .",
    "most states of physical systems are coupled , however , to different channels ( environments ) .",
    "for example , the transmission through a small system ( e.g. a quantum dot ) is related to , at least , two channels , the entrance and the exit channel .",
    "the transmission through such systems is studied by many authors in many different papers by using different methods . in the present paper , it is studied for the first time in the framework of the non - hermitian quantum physics without additional assumptions ( such as , e.g. , tight - binding ) by taking into account that the ( localized ) system is embedded in more than one environment , i.e. that it is coupled to more than one channel .",
    "the results are compared to those known for open quantum systems embedded in one common environment .",
    "the similarities and differences are the following .    1 .",
    "far from singular points , the spectroscopic properties of the system are influenced only marginal by its embedding into an environment .",
    "this result is independent of the number of environments .",
    "2 .   in the neighborhood of singular points ( eps )",
    ", the dynamical behavior of the system is determined by nonlinear processes which are caused by the existence of the singular points .",
    "the nonlinear processes restore , in any case , the resonance structure of the cross section obtained without em .",
    "this causes the possibility to describe the system without taking into account em and eps in the _ one - channel _ case @xcite . in the _ two - channel _ case",
    ", however , it gives rise to an enhancement of the transmission at maximum width bifurcation ( or maximum level repulsion ) .",
    "this effect is measurable .",
    "an experimental test of the formalism of the non - hermitian description of open quantum systems is therefore possible in the two - channel ( or more - channel ) case , while it is impossible @xcite in the one - channel case .",
    "although em is a second - order effect , it may become important in the neighborhood of eps due the nonlinear processes dominating the dynamics in this parameter range .",
    "we underline once more that these processes are related to internal properties of the eigenstates of a non - hermitian hamilton operator .",
    "they are _ not _ involved in any version of hermitian quantum physics .    according to early studies @xcite of open quantum systems by means of a non - hermitian hamilton operator ,",
    "short - lived states appear together with long - lived ones at high level density even without changing the coupling strength between system and environment .",
    "these states result from the phenomenon resonance trapping occurring in the regime of overlapping resonances @xcite .    in some papers",
    ", this phenomenon is studied as a function of the coupling strength between system and environment and is called segregation of decay widths @xcite . here",
    "the short - living states are called superradiant states and the long - lived ones subradiant states .",
    "this formalism is applied also to the description of transmission , see e.g. @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", an enhancement of transmission is related to the existence of a superradiant state ( together with subradiant states ) .",
    "in contrast to this interpretation , the enhancement of transmission in a certain critical parameter range is , according to the results obtained by us in the present paper , _ not _ caused by the existence of a superradiant state . correspondingly , subradiant states do not appear in our calculations .",
    "instead , the enhancement of the transmission in a certain energy window occurs , in our calculations , due to nonlinear processes .",
    "it is related to the non - rigidity of the phases of the eigenfunctions of @xmath93 in the neighborhood of eps and to the em of the states via the environment .",
    "the numerical results show clearly that an enhancement of the transmission in a certain energy window is correlated with a reduction of the phase rigidity , when averaged over energy in this window .",
    "this result is the same as that obtained in @xcite . in this paper , the transmission through a system with many states",
    "is calculated numerically by using the tight - binding lattice model ( according to datta @xcite ) with one channel in each of the two attached identical leads . as a result of this calculation , the phase rigidity , averaged over the considered energy window , and the transmission",
    "are anti - correlated .",
    "thus , the two very different methods ( each of which solves the problem exactly ) produce qualitatively the same results .",
    "considering the results of the present paper , we arrive at the following conclusion .",
    "a direct experimental test of the formalism of non - hermitian quantum physics is possible by investigating the question whether or not the observed enhanced transmission in a certain parameter range is related to the existence of a superradiant state .",
    "according to theory @xcite , a superradiant state appears if the coupling strength between system and environment increases .",
    "it appears always together with subradiant long - lived states .",
    "in contrast to this statement , our results show that an enhanced transmission in a certain parameter region is caused by the properties of the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian hamilton operator @xmath1 , above all by the non - rigid phases of its eigenfunctions .",
    "a special state which is strongly coupled to the environment and is correlated with a partial decoupling of other states from the environment , does not exist .",
    "summarizing we state that open quantum systems embedded in two ( or more ) environments are abounded in very many interesting aspects of non - hermitian quantum physics .",
    "they allow , on the one hand , to test experimentally the basic features of non - hermitian quantum physics . on the other hand",
    ", they provide the possibility of many promising applications .",
    "in contrast to the definition that is used in , for example , nuclear physics , we define the complex energies before and after diagonalization of @xmath93 by @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 for decaying states . this definition will be useful when discussing systems with _",
