    "the young star cluster ngc602 and the associated hii region n90 ( henize 1956 ) are located in a relatively isolated and diffuse environment in the `` wing '' of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , towards the edge of the magellanic bridge . in many ways",
    ", ngc602 represents an extragalactic analogue to the greater orion ob association : it has a similar overall size ( @xmath9pc ) , it contains similarly few o - type stars of about the same age ( @xmath10myr ) and , like orion , it is located at the surface of a big molecular cloud in a `` blister '' opened by the radiation of the early stars .",
    "these young massive stars and the associated hii region have been known and studied for almost fifty years ( westerlund 1964 ; hutchings et al . 1991 ; battinelli & demers 1992 ; massey et al .",
    "2000 ) , but very little was known about low - mass objects in the field . recently , however , thanks to observations made with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ , it has become possible to study the star formation in ngc602 and surrounding regions over a wide range of masses and this subject has been the topic of a number of recent papers",
    ".    carlson et al . ( 2007 ) carried out a panchromatic study of ngc602 with the hst at optical wavelengths and _ spitzer _ in the range @xmath11@xmath12 m ( later extended to 24@xmath12 m by carlson et al .",
    "2011 ) , discovering an extensive population of candidate pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars and young stellar objects ( ysos ) . through comparison of the observed magnitudes with theoretical pms isochrones",
    "( although initially not for the metallicity appropriate for the smc ) and with models of the spectral energy distribution of ysos , they conclude that star formation started about 4myr ago in the central cluster and later propagated towards the periphery , where it still continues .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by gouliermis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , whose analysis of archival _ spitzer _ mid - infrared observations of an area of 30arcmin@xmath13 around ngc602 reveals 22 yso candidates , along the rims of the parent molecular cloud . like carlson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , gouliermis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) attribute the formation of these ysos to triggering caused by the photoionisation of the young stellar association .    combining high resolution echelle spectroscopy and velocity maps from a neutral hydrogen ( hi ) survey ( stavely  smith et al .",
    "1997 ) with the hst observations of carlson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , nigra et al ( 2008 ) tried to establish the likely scenario leading to the formation of ngc602 .",
    "these authors do not find morphological evidence of violent events such as supernovae or strong stellar winds .",
    "they suggest instead that about 7myr ago the interaction of two expanding hi shells created an overdensity , from which ngc602 started to form about 3myr later , and newly formed massive stars started to erode the surrounding nebular material , creating a photodissociation region .",
    "these authors speculate that ngc602 is the result of a single star - forming event , in a region of low gas density .",
    "however , as we will show in this work , the star formation history of this region is much more complex than what nigra et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested .",
    "indeed , cignoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have already shown that , even though the current star formation episode at the centre of ngc602 ( hereafter ngc602a ) had a peak about 2.5myr ago , two neighbouring associations appreciably older than it ( ngc602b and ngc602b2 ) were formed as part of the same process . according to their analysis",
    ", these associations have ages between 15 and 150myr ( schmalzl et al .",
    "2008 had previously suggested ages of 80 and 160myr for ngc602b and ngc602b2 , respectively ) .    to understand how star formation has proceeded in this field , it is crucial to study the properties of pms stars , particularly of those of lower mass .",
    "these objects represent a living record of how star formation has proceeded over the past @xmath9myr or more , which is a time span much longer than the one offered by the study of massive stars .",
    "all the works cited above have indeed made use of pms stars to probe recent star formation .",
    "however , the selection of pms objects in those papers is based on a topological analysis in the broad - band colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) alone , namely in the @xmath0 _ vs. _ @xmath14 plane .",
    "therefore , those studies are limited to the youngest pms stars , with ages younger than @xmath15myr , which are well separated in colour from ms stars . in the cmd",
    ", these objects are located to the right of and above the ms . conversely , any pms objects older than @xmath16myr are very hard to distinguish from the ms itself in the cmd , thereby thwarting any attempt to study other recent star formation episodes in the same field .    on the other hand , thanks to distinctive emission features in the spectra of pms stars still undergoing mass accretion , we have shown that it is possible to efficiently and reliably identify all objects of this type in a stellar field , regardless of their age and of their position in the cmd .",
    "building on the work of romaniello ( 1998 ) , of panagia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and of romaniello et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , de marchi , panagia & romaniello ( 2010 , hereafter paperi ) and de marchi et al .",
    "( 2011b , hereafter paperii ) showed that through a suitable combination of broad- and narrow - band photometry an accurate determination of the h@xmath17 luminosity of these objects is possible , from which the accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate can be derived . in this work , we apply the methods developed and tested in papersi and ii to investigate how star formation has proceeded in the ngc602 region .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section2 we describe the observations and the photometric analysis , while we devote section3 to the search for pms stars through their h@xmath17 excess emission . in section 4",
    "we derive the physical parameters for these objects , including effective temperature , luminosity , age , mass and accretion luminosity , while section5 addresses the presence of several generations of stars in the field and their mutual relationships . in section6",
    "we derive the mass accretion rate and study how it evolves in time .",
    "a summary of the most important conclusions of the paper is presented in section7 .",
    "this work is based on observations of a field of @xmath18 around the cluster ngc602 obtained on 2004 july 14 and 18 with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board of the hst ( proposal nr . 10248 , principal investigator a. nota ) .",
    "the dataset includes observations in the f555w band ( hereafter @xmath0 ; five exposures for a total duration of 2153s ) , f814w band ( hereafter @xmath1 ; five exposures for a total of 2265s ) and n658n band ( hereafter @xmath2 ; three exposure for a total of 1908s ) .",
    "a suitable dithering pattern and the combination of long and short exposures in the same band provide proper sampling of the point spread function ( psf ) , while preventing saturation of the brightest stars .",
    "as regards the photometry , we first analysed the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band images , starting from the flat - fielded exposures corrected for geometric distortion and for the effective area of each pixel ( see sirianni et al . 2005 for details ) . the psf - fitting procedure daophotii ( stetson 1987 ) was applied to each individual frame and a master list of stars was obtained using all the stars detected in at least six of the ten @xmath0- and @xmath1-band images .",
    "we derived in this way an initial catalogue free of spurious detections , such as cosmic rays or haloes and spikes around saturated stars , containing 7021 objects detected in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , of which 6261 are also detected in the @xmath2 band .",
    "we furthermore restricted the daophotii sharpness parameter @xmath19 to span the range @xmath20 , in order to exclude cosmic rays and extended objects .    the resulting master list , containing 5788 stars ,",
    "was then used to perform psf fitting over the entire dataset , including the @xmath2 images , using the standard allframe routine ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "the average of the magnitudes measured in each individual frame for every master list object was adopted as the star magnitude in the final catalogue , while we took the resulting standard deviation around the mean for each object as the associated photometric uncertainty ( see e.g. stetson 1987 ) . down to magnitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 all stars detected in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also detected in @xmath2 .",
    "this fraction drops to 95% at @xmath23 and @xmath24 and no stars detected in @xmath2 are fainter than these limits .    since in the case of the @xmath2 images",
    "there are only three exposures , we also conducted artificial star tests on those images in order to independently verify the photometric uncertainty ( see e.g. stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "we added more than 170000 artificial stars , spread over several tests and uniformly distributed with a density of one object per @xmath25 square arcsec , in order to not alter the crowding conditions of the frames .",
    "the input magnitudes of the artificial stars were drawn from a luminosity function similar to the observed one but monotonically extended well beyond the detection limit , in order to increase the statistics for faint stars .",
    "we then applied the same photometric procedure used for the original images and compared the input magnitudes with the derived magnitudes , finding an excellent agreement in their values , as shown in figure[fig1 ] .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the mean difference and the error bars show the @xmath26 uncertainties . in the analysis that follows",
    "we will take these as photometric uncertainties in the @xmath2 band . in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands",
    "the photometric uncertainties are considerably smaller , owing to the wider pass bands .",
    "we also show for reference in figure[fig1 ] the photometric uncertainty ( shaded area ) as derived by allframe , which is slightly smaller than those derived through artificial star experiments , as expected ( see e.g. beccari et al .",
    "in summary , the artificial star experiments gave us general confidence that the uncertainties assigned by our photometry to the magnitudes of individual stars is realistic , also in the @xmath2 band .",
    "the final catalogue contains a total of 5500 stars , with well defined magnitudes in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , which were calibrated into the vegamag photometric system according to the procedures described in sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and using the most current photometric zero points ( bohlin 2012 ) .",
    "the outcome of our photometry is the cmd of the entire field , as shown in figure[fig2 ] .",
    "having defined the combined photometric uncertainty in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands as :    @xmath27    objects with @xmath28mag are indicated as larger grey dots , whereas smaller grey dots are used for the remaining stars ( objects marked as thick dark dots , orange in the online version , correspond to stars with h@xmath17 excess emission and are discussed in section3 ) .",
    "the magnitudes shown in the cmd ( and in all figures thereafter ) have already been corrected for the effects of interstellar extinction .",
    "adopting the canonical value of @xmath29 ( see carlson et al .",
    "2007 and schmalzl et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein , for an extensive discussion of the extinction in this region ) , and assuming that the reddening law derived by scuderi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the field of sn1987a also applies to this region of the smc , we obtain @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the specific acs bands used here .",
    "the corresponding reddening vector is shown by the small arrow in figure[fig2 ] .",
    "the cmd of figure[fig2 ] reveals that in the field covered by these observations there are stars of different ages : there are young massive stars in the upper ms ( with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , there are objects brighter and redder than the ms , in the region usually occupied by pms stars , and there are stars in the lower ms and along what appears as the red - giants branch with a prominent red clump at @xmath35 , which are usually populated by older objects .",
    "this variety of stellar populations has already been considered and discussed in a number of recent papers ( see carlson et al . 2007 ;",
    "schmalzl et al .",
    "2008 ; cignoni et al . 2009 ; gouliermis et al .",
    "note that , owing to the high galactic latitude of the smc , the contamination due to foreground milky way sources is insignificant .",
    "according to the besanon galactic stellar population synthesis models ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) , only four foreground stars with magnitudes in the range @xmath36 should be present towards ngc602 in a field of the size covered by our observations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , all these works identify as pms stars all objects located appreciably to the right of the ms and above it . in this paper , however , for the first time we look for the signs of the active mass accretion process that is expected to accompany the pms phase and that is responsible for the strong excess emission normally observed in objects of this type ( e.g. calvet et al . 2000 ) . in particular , following the method developed in papersi and ii , we have looked for the presence of an excess in the h@xmath17 emission line by using a combination of broad - band ( @xmath37 ) and narrow - band ( @xmath2 ) photometry .",
    "this way of identifying pms stars is more reliable than the simple classification based on the position of the objects in the cmd or hertzsprung  russell ( h  r ) diagram and provides for a secure detection of relatively old pms stars , already close to the ms .",
    "as explained in paperi , the majority of stars in a typical stellar field have no excess h@xmath17 emission .",
    "therefore , the _ median _ value of the @xmath38 colour index at a given effective temperature @xmath39 defines a spectral reference template for all stars with that @xmath39 and can be used to identify objects with h@xmath17 excess . in practice , the @xmath38",
    "_ vs. _ @xmath14 diagram shown in figure[fig3 ] can be used for this purpose .",
    "stars shown as light grey dots are objects with a combined photometric uncertainty @xmath40mag , where    @xmath41    and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the photometric uncertainties in the corresponding bands .",
    "a total of @xmath45 objects satisfy this condition , with the most stringent constraint being set by the uncertainty in @xmath2 ( the typical uncertainty in the other two bands are less than @xmath46mag ) .",
    "the log - dashed line represents the median @xmath38 colour obtained as the running median with a box - car size of 100 points ( the box - car size is reduced to 10 points for @xmath47 , where there are fewer stars ) .",
    "it is reassuring to see that the reference template empirically defined by the dashed line is in remarkably good agreement with the model atmospheres of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , shown by the thick solid line for this specific acs filter set .    in order to find stars with h@xmath17 excess emission ,",
    "it is sufficient to look for objects with a @xmath38 index exceeding that of the reference template at the same @xmath14 in a significant way . as in previous works ( e.g. papersi and ii ; beccari",
    "et al . 2010 ; de marchi et al .",
    "2011c ; spezzi et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter paperiii ) , we set this limit at the @xmath48 level and looked for stars that exceed the reference template by at least four times their @xmath38 photometric uncertainty . indicating with @xmath49 the observed value and with @xmath50 the value on the reference template at the same @xmath14 colour , we define their difference as    @xmath51    then the condition to be satisfied for considering the star a bona - fide pms object is that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the photometric uncertainty on the @xmath49 colour .",
    "a total of 400 objects satisfy this condition and they are shown in figure[fig3 ] as large dots ( orange in the online version ) .",
    "as mentioned above , all magnitudes in figure[fig3 ] are corrected for extinction using the average value @xmath30 for all stars and the reddening law of scuderi et al .",
    "the reddening vector for @xmath30 is shown by the small arrow , like in figure[fig2 ] , but for better illustrating its direction we have extended it with the dotted line by a factor of ten , in order to show that the vector is almost parallel to the reference template .",
    "this means that even relatively large fluctuations in the reddening correction of individual stars , due for instance to patchy absorption , would not significantly affect the identification of stars with h@xmath17 excess .",
    "all these stars have a robust h@xmath17 excess emission and as such they are candidate pms objects . however , to further restrict the list to the most certain pms stars , following white & basri ( 2003 ) , paperi and barentsen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we conservatively limit our selection to stars which also have an equivalent width of the h@xmath17 emission line of more than 10 , or @xmath54  if , as customary , negative values of the equivalent width are used for emission lines . according to white & basri ( 2003 ) ,",
    "@xmath55  is a clear sign of accretion in genuine t tauri stars of spectral type earlier than m2.5 ( roughly @xmath56 for the specific acs filters ) , since it can not be caused by chromospheric activity .",
    "as regards the equivalent widths , we derive them directly from the colour difference between the @xmath38 index of the star and that of the reference template in figure[fig3 ] and from the properties of the @xmath2 filter , as explained in detail in paperi .",
    "more precisely , if the stars defining the reference template had no h@xmath17 absorption features , their @xmath38 colour would correspond to that of the pure continuum and could be directly used to derive the equivalent width of the h@xmath17 emission line , @xmath57 . as explained in paperi ,",
    "although certainly valid for stars with large h@xmath17 excess , this assumption is not true in general",
    ". instead , given the excellent agreement between the reference template and the model atmospheres of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we can use the a modified version of the latter , with the h@xmath17 emission line suppressed , to derive the magnitude of the sole continuum in the specific @xmath2 band of the acs , as a function of spectral type or @xmath14 colour . since the h@xmath17 line profile is very narrow when compared to the width of the filter , the equivalent width is simply given by the relationship :    @xmath58 \\label{eq4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 is the rectangular width of the filter ( similar in definition to the equivalent width of a line ) , which depends on the characteristics of the filter",
    ", @xmath2 is the measured magnitude and @xmath60 the magnitude of the sole continuum .",
    "the value of @xmath59 for the acs f658n filter used here is @xmath61  and values for the @xmath2 bands of current and past hst instruments are given in paperi .",
    "a small correction is then applied to the derived @xmath62 values to account for the fact that for normal stars ( those in grey in figure[fig3 ] ) the h@xmath17 line is normally in absorption ( see paperi ) .",
    "the stars with @xmath54  are shown as large orange dots in figure[fig3 ] , and are located above the short dashed line corresponding to @xmath63 . in total",
    "we find 296 objects redder than @xmath64 that satisfy this condition , with a median equivalent width @xmath65  and a median h@xmath17 luminosity @xmath66l@xmath67 .",
    "hereafter , we take these objects as bona - fide pms stars .",
    "the median @xmath68 and @xmath69 values might appear larger than those typical of galactic t - tauri stars , but as explained above our sample only includes objects with @xmath70  and therefore stars with low @xmath69 are automatically excluded .",
    "these objects are shown in the cmd of figure[fig2 ] as large dots ( orange in the online version ) .",
    "interestingly , not all of them are in the region occupied by young pms stars , i.e. brighter and redder than the ms , as some are very close to or at the ms itself .",
    "this is a consistent feature of all the star - forming regions previously observed by us in the magellanic clouds and in the milky way ( e.g. panagia et al . 2000 ; papersi and ii ; beccari et al .",
    "2010 ; de marchi et al . 2011c ; paperiii ) .",
    "several types of h@xmath17 emitting sources could occupy the ms region the cmd but , as we will now show , the most likely explanation is that these are older pms stars , approaching the ms and still actively accreting .",
    "examples of objects with h@xmath17 excess in this region of the cmd include cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and stars with active chromospheres , such as rs cvn objects or dme stars .",
    "chromospheric activity , however , can be immediately ruled out , because it causes very weak h@xmath17 emission for stars earlier than spectral type m2 , with equivalent widths typically of order @xmath71  ( e.g. bopp & talcott 1978 ; bopp & schmitz 1978 ) .",
    "precisely , it is to keep our sample free from objects of this type that , following white & basri ( 2003 ) , we only consider stars with @xmath54 .",
    "on the other hand , cvs have typical @xmath68 in the same range as the one we measure ( e.g. warner 1995 and references therein ) , but these objects are very infrequent .",
    "pretorius & knigge ( 2008 ) searched for objects with h@xmath17 excess in the @xmath72 vs. @xmath73 diagram ( similar to our figure[fig3 ] ) , using observations from the aao / ukst supercosmos h@xmath17 survey ( parker et al . 2005 ) .",
    "they analysed the @xmath74 and @xmath2 photometry down to @xmath75 in 175 regions , each 4deg on a side , for a total covered area of @xmath76deg@xmath77 at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath78deg ) .",
    "each region contains of order 170000 stars , for a total of about 30 million objects , and only 14 cvs were found amongst them , with an implied frequency of order @xmath79 . considering that the typical distance to these cvs is @xmath80pc ( pretorius & knigge 2008 ) , the @xmath75 magnitude limit for these stars translates to about @xmath81 at the distance of ngc602 and as such it is very similar to the detection limit of our photometry .",
    "therefore , with a total of 5500 stars in our field we should expect essentially no ( @xmath82 ) cvs .",
    "considering that the metallicity of the stars in the smc is about a factor of five lower than that of the objects in the galactic plane , we have also looked at the fraction of cvs in galactic globular clusters ( gc ) , which have lower metallicity . the cluster 47tuc , with @xmath83=-0.76 $ ] ( harris 1996 ) , offers conditions very similar to those of the smc field .",
    "this cluster contains the largest known number of cvs in a gc ( downes et al . 2005 ) , most of which are located near the cluster centre ( heinke et al . 2005 ) . inside a field of @xmath84 around the cluster centre ,",
    "observed with the hst as part of the acs globular clusters survey ( sarajedini et al .",
    "2007 ) , there are in total @xmath85 stars down to @xmath86 .",
    "of these stars , 30 are classified as cvs from their x - ray properties ( heinke et al . 2005 ) and only six of them have excess emission in h@xmath17 with @xmath87  ( beccari et al .",
    "2013 ) , with an implied frequency of @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , with a total of 5500 stars , the expected number of cvs in our field ( @xmath89 ) remains insignificant .    in summary , it is possible ( and perhaps even likely ) that some of the stars with h@xmath17 excess bluer than the ms in figure[fig2 ] are objects of this type .",
    "precisely for that reason we do not consider any objects with h@xmath17 excess bluer than @xmath64 in this work .",
    "however , it is clear that cvs can not be responsible for the large population of objects with h@xmath17 excess near the ms .",
    "as concluded in the previous works in this series , the most likely nature of these objects is that they are recently formed stars still actively accreting while they approach the ms . in the next section",
    "we will derive the physical properties of these and of the younger pms stars through comparison with pms evolutionary models .",
    "the luminosities ( @xmath90 ) and effective temperatures ( @xmath39 ) of all stars with photometric uncertainty in @xmath0 and @xmath1 smaller than @xmath91mag are shown in the h ",
    "r diagram ( figure[fig4 ] ) as light grey dots , whereas pms stars are shown as dark dots ( orange in the online version ; note that the size of the dots is proportional to the mass accretion rate , as explained later ) .",
    "effective temperatures are determined by fitting the dereddened @xmath14 colours of the stars with the ones computed for the same hst bands using stellar atmosphere models .",
    "we have adopted the model atmospheres of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the metallicity @xmath92=-0.5 $ ] appropriate for the smc , as they provide a well - tested , homogeneous set covering the temperature interval between 3500 and 50000 k in the wavelength range between 90  and 160@xmath12 m .",
    "the dereddened magnitudes are then compared with the absolute magnitudes of the models of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) computed for the same bands .",
    "these models were renormalised by romaniello et al .",
    "( 2002 ; see their table 6 ) in order to provide the absolute magnitudes of stars of a given temperature and surface gravity , for a radius of 1r@xmath67 and a distance of 10pc . knowing the distance to each source",
    ", we can derive its radius @xmath93 since the magnitude difference @xmath94 scales as @xmath95 . finally , the bolometric luminosity is derived knowing the distance to the objects , from the stellar radius and effective temperature , compared to those of the sun ( see romaniello et al .",
    "2002 for further details ) . as for the distance to the smc ,",
    "we have assumed a distance modulus of @xmath96 corresponding to @xmath97kpc ( hilditch et al .",
    "2005 ; keller & wood 2006 ) .",
    "note that the sharp cut - off at @xmath98 in figure[fig4 ] is caused by the limited extent of the model atmospheres and , therefore , all objects redder than @xmath99 are ignored .",
    "we also show in figure[fig4 ] the evolutionary tracks ( thick solid lines ) and isochrones ( dashed lines ) from the pms evolutionary models of the pisa group ( deglinnocenti et al .",
    "2008 ; tognelli et al .",
    "the models have been calculated for @xmath100 , @xmath101 and the mixing - length parameter @xmath102 for masses in the range @xmath103m@xmath104 . as shown by cignoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , with the assumed distance modulus and reddening @xmath105 and this choice of the metallicity , the padua isochrones ( fagotto et al . 1994 ; marigo et al . 2008 ) provide an excellent fit to the upper ms .",
    "this metallicity also nicely agrees with the currently accepted values for the smc , which range from @xmath106 to @xmath107z@xmath67 ( see russell & dopita 1992 ; rolleston et al .",
    "1999 ; lee et al . 2005 ; perez  montero & diaz 2005 )",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that this metallicity is a factor of two higher than that implied by the observations of ngc346 , in the bar of the smc , where a metallicity value of @xmath108 is preferable ( see paperii ) .",
    "this difference is also consistent with the available measurements of the ratio between extinction and column density of neutral hydrogen @xmath109 . from gordon",
    "( 2003 ) , expressing @xmath110 in units of @xmath111@xmath112 , we find the ratio to be @xmath113 in the smc wing and a value about a factor of two lower in the smc bar ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "assuming that the ratio scales linearly with metallicity ( e.g. scuderi et al . 1996 ) , this result suggests indeed a factor of @xmath10 higher metal content in ngc602 than in ngc346 .    in figure[fig4 ] , the masses corresponding to the individual tracks are indicated on the right - hand side , whereas the ages of the isochrones increase by a factor of two at each step , starting from @xmath115myr at the right end to 64myr at the left end .",

    "the majority of pms stars appear to be less massive than @xmath118m@xmath104 . using a finer grid of models than the one shown in figure[fig4 ]",
    ", we derived a more accurate measure of the mass and age for 276 pms stars , excluding the 20 coolest objects that would have required a rather uncertain extrapolation beyond the limits of the theoretical models ( see romaniello 1998 for details on the method used , with an approach similar to the one recently presented by da rio et al .",
    "2012 ) . while an accurate determination of the absolute age and mass of individual objects will require spectroscopy only possible with future instrumentation ( e.g. the james webb space telescope ; gardner et al .",
    "2006 ) , we can nonetheless derive important information on the properties of star formation in this field by comparing relative ages and masses of groups of stars .",
    "histograms with the age and mass distribution for the 276 stars are shown in figures[fig5]a and [ fig5]b , respectively . besides the remarkable paucity of stars in the @xmath119myr range , already seen in the h ",

    "the double peak seen in the figure implies that in the past this region underwent at least one and possibly several bursts of star formation , likely as intense as the one currently revealed by the 02myr old objects .",
    "we will come back to this point in section5 .",
    "the @xmath121 parameter defined in the previous section also allows us to easily derive the h@xmath17 emission line luminosity @xmath69 for these stars .",
    "as explained in paperi , @xmath69 is obtained from @xmath122 , from the photometric zero point and absolute sensitivity of the instrumental set - up and from the distance to the sources . as for the latter ,",
    "we have assumed a distance modulus @xmath123 as mentioned before , whereas the photometric properties of the instrument are as listed in the acs instrument handbook ( maybhate et al .",

    "we stress here that , although our sample only includes objects with @xmath54 , the @xmath69 values that we find are in excellent agreement with those of galactic stars of similar mass .",
    "dahm ( 2008 ) analysed the h@xmath17 luminosity of a group of t tauri stars in taurus ",
    "auriga , taken from the original sample of valenti et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , with masses similar to those of the objects in our sample .",
    "he obtains @xmath69 luminosities ranging from @xmath125l@xmath67 ( 17 percentile ) to @xmath127l@xmath67 ( 83 percentile ) , in excellent agreement with our measurements .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath69 is typically @xmath128% and is completely dominated by the statistical uncertainty on the @xmath2 photometry ( 10% ) , with the distance accounting for 5% ( hilditch et al .",
    "2005 ; keller & wood 2006 ) and the absolute sensitivity of the instrumental setup for another 3% .",
    "these values are corrected for the small contribution from the [ nii ] emission features at @xmath129and @xmath130  that are included in the rather wide f658n passband of the acs .",
    "the correction is very small , only @xmath131% , but since it is a systematic effect it is a good practice to apply it .",
    "having measured @xmath69 we can derive another important physical parameter for the pms stars , namely the accretion luminosity @xmath132 .",
    "as discussed in paperi , dahm s ( 2008 ) logarithmic best fit to the @xmath133 _ vs. _ @xmath134 plane would provide a slope of @xmath135 for such a relationship . on the other hand , theoretical models ( e.g. muzerolle et al .",
    "1998 ) would predict logarithmic slopes of about unity for low accretion rates , i.e. faint @xmath69 , and shallower slopes for higher luminosities . in the absence of compelling evidence in favour or against a steep slope",
    ", we adopt a logarithmic slope of unity for the empirical @xmath133 _ vs. _ @xmath134 relationship , which is inside the uncertainty band on dahm s ( 2008 ) value . in their recent study of accretion rates for t tauri stars using nearly simultaneous ultraviolet and optical observations , ingleby et al .",

    "a choice of unity has a physical meaning and implies that a constant fraction of the gravitational energy released in the accretion process goes into h@xmath17 emission . in paperi and",
    "ii we determined the proportionality constant from the data summarised by dahm ( 2008 ) , combined with the dispersion measured for the stars in ngc346 , finding    @xmath141    we will make use of @xmath142 obtained in this way in section6 for deriving the mass accretion rate @xmath4 .",
    "the median value of @xmath142 that we find for the pms stars in our sample is @xmath143l@xmath67 . comparing this value to the typical bolometric luminosities @xmath144 of these objects ,",
    "we find the median @xmath145 ratio to be @xmath146 .",
    "the 17 and 83 percentiles , which in a gaussian distribution would correspond to the @xmath26 values , are respectively @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the derived @xmath145 ratio indicates that in our sample the accretion luminosity does not dominate the total stellar luminosity , as is expected of stars that are no longer in the embedded phase ( e.g. nisini et al .",
    "2005 ; antoniucci et al .",
    "taking again valenti et al.s ( 1993 ) sample of pms stars in taurus ",
    "auriga , the median @xmath149 ratio is @xmath150 , whereas the corresponding value in our sample is @xmath146 or a factor of two higher .",
    "however , as explained above , we restrict our analysis to stars with @xmath151 , thereby excluding all objects with small h@xmath17 excess and small h@xmath17 luminosity , and therefore it is to be expected that we will miss objects with small accretion luminosity .",
    "as discussed in section3 , the age distribution of the pms stars in our sample is bimodal ( see figure[fig5]a ) .",
    "about 1/2 of the objects appear younger than @xmath15myr and about 1/3 older than @xmath120myr , with few objects ( 50 ) at intermediate ages .",
    "these ages are based on the comparison of the observations with theoretical isochrones and , as such , they are subject to uncertainties .",
    "besides photometric errors and uncertainties in the input physics affecting the models , there are other physical effects that could cause an incorrect determination of the age ( or mass ) of individual objects .",
    "these include for instance unresolved binaries , differential reddening , stellar variability , veiling resulting from accretion , and scattering due to a disc seen at high inclination .",
    "all these effects combine to produce a broadening in the h ",
    "r diagram , which could be misinterpreted as an age spread ( see e.g. hennekemper et al . 2007 and da rio et al . 2010 ) .",
    "in fact , even though all the effects mentioned above could mimic an age spread , none of them can produce the clearly bimodal distribution that we observe in the h ",
    "r diagram .",
    "the remarkable paucity of pms stars with age comprised between the 4myr and 16myr isochrones ( already evident in figure[fig4 ] ) is quantified in figure[fig6 ] , where we show the distribution of pms stars as a function of the difference in their @xmath152 values .",
    "the distribution is obtained by counting the number of pms stars in strips parallel to the zero - age ms ( zams ) , starting from the dot - dashed line , and it is clearly bimodal , with two peaks separated by several times their width .",
    "a gaussian fit to the two peaks ( dot  dashed lines in figure[fig6]b ) gives @xmath153dex for older pms stars and @xmath154dex for younger pms stars .",
    "the separation between the two peaks ( @xmath91dex ) corresponds to respectively 5 and 4 times these widths and confirms that the two distributions are clearly distinct .",
    "physically , it is hard to imagine a mechanism that would affect the temperatures and luminosities of stars in such a way that they are selectively displaced from the region occupied by young pms objects in the h ",
    "r diagram and moved towards the ms , while leaving only a handful of them in the region in between .",
    "therefore , while the effects mentioned above can introduce uncertainties on the relative ages of individual objects ( in paperi these are estimated to be typically no more than a factor of @xmath155 ) , we can safely conclude that the two groups of stars with h@xmath17 excess seen in the h ",
    "r diagram must belong to different generations , with ages that differ by much more than a factor of two and likely up to an order of magnitude .",
    "a histogram of the age distribution was already shown in figure[fig5]a .",
    "considering the uncertainties inherent in our age determination , stemming from the comparison of model isochrones with our photometric data , the histogram in figure[fig7 ] offers a more realistic representation of the relative age distribution , with ages binned using a constant logarithmic step ( a factor of 2 ) .",
    "the solid line gives the actual number of stars contained within each age bin , while the dot - dashed line provides a measurement of the apparent star formation rate , obtained by dividing the number of objects in each bin by the width of the bin itself ( we use a dotted line at the extremes of the distribution to indicate larger uncertainties ) .",
    "note that the dot - dashed line in figure[fig7 ] clearly provides a lower limit to the star formation rate .",
    "first of all , crowding effects , particularly in the proximity of massive stars , make the detection of faint low - mass pms stars more difficult .",
    "furthermore , here we only consider pms stars in the range @xmath156m@xmath104 having h@xmath17 excess emission at the @xmath48 level or more at the time of the observations .",
    "since the strength and equivalent width of the h@xmath17 emission line are highly variable in time ( e.g. fernandez et al .",
    "1995 ; smith et al . 1999 ; alencar et al .",
    "2001 ) , the objects that at any given time show h@xmath17 excess emission at these levels are necessarily only a fraction of the total population of pms stars .",
    "assuming that all objects cooler than the 5myr isochrone in the h ",
    "r diagram of figure[fig6]a are pms stars , we find that the fraction of those with h@xmath17 excess emission is @xmath157% .",
    "therefore , for young stars , the upper limit to the number of pms objects is @xmath158 times larger than what we measure . as",
    "regards older pms stars , one expects the fraction of objects with h@xmath17 excess to be lower than for younger stars .",
    "indeed , as we will show in section5.3 , for two older clusters in the field this fraction is @xmath159% along the ms in the range @xmath160 .",
    "thus , the actual number of pms stars for ages older than @xmath161myr is at most @xmath162 times larger than what we measure , since the stars without excess along the ms may include much older field stars .",
    "near the peak of the distribution in figure[fig7 ] , at @xmath163myr , the lower limit to the star formation rate is @xmath164m@xmath104yr@xmath165 ( the median mass of those objects is @xmath166m@xmath104 ) .",
    "the corresponding upper limit is @xmath158 times this value , i.e. @xmath167m@xmath104yr@xmath165 , in excellent agreement with that found by cignoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for this cluster . at @xmath161myr",
    "the lower limit to the rate drops by a factor of 30 to @xmath168m@xmath104yr@xmath165 ( median mass @xmath169m@xmath104 ) , although the corresponding upper limit is about an order of magnitude higher .    in spite of the uncertainties on the age of the individual objects mentioned above ,",
    "it is clear that beyond @xmath120myr a highly significant increase is seen , both in the star formation rate ( @xmath170 ) and in the number of stars per bin ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "this indicates that the current burst is not the only one in this area and it might not even be the most prominent one , since the total integrated output of stars older than @xmath120myr and those younger than a few myr ( solid line ) is comparable . in fact , if the fraction of pms stars with h@xmath17 excess has an exponential decay with time ( fedele et al . 2010 ) , episodes occurring more than 30myr ago might have contributed a large portion of the stars in this region . since the accuracy on relative ages is of order a factor of @xmath155 ( paperi )",
    ", it is not possible to estimate exactly how long the previous burst lasted nor how many short bursts took place in the time frame of @xmath120myr covered by the last age bin . therefore , if there was just one burst , the star formation strength might have been considerably higher than that of the current episode .    besides very different ages , the two populations of younger and older pms stars also have considerably different spatial density distributions .",
    "we compare these distributions to one another in figure[fig8 ] by means of contour lines of stellar density with logarithmic steps , overlaid on a true - colour image of the region .",
    "out of the total population of 276 pms stars with well defined masses and ages , we have selected all those younger than 5myr ( a total of 132 objects , cyan in the online version ) and those older than 20myr ( in total 111 objects , orange in the online version ) .",
    "the contour plots shown for each of these groups in figure[fig8 ] were obtained after smoothing the actual distribution with a gaussian beam with size @xmath172 or @xmath173pc , as indicated by the circle at the bottom of the figure .",
    "the lowest contour level corresponds to a local density of pms stars three times as high as the average pms stars density over the entire field .",
    "the steps between contour levels are constant and corresponds to a factor of 2 .",
    "we also show with small dots ( yellow in the online version ) the positions of 34 stars with ages between 5 and 20myr .",
    "the remarkable feature in this figure is the difference in the spatial distribution of younger and older pms stars : older objects are much more widely distributed and , except for the centre of ngc602 , they do not always overlap with the younger generation .",
    "this difference confirms that episodic accretion ( e.g. baraffe et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) is not at the origin of the bimodal distribution of pms stars in figure[fig6 ] , since it would otherwise require a rather contrived spatial separation of stars with different accretion histories . in the following sections we discuss the two groups of objects in more detail .",
    "ccccccccc 1 & 1 & @xmath174 & @xmath175 & 35 & @xmath176 & @xmath177 & @xmath82 & @xmath178 + 2 & 2 & @xmath179 & @xmath180 & 11 & @xmath181 & @xmath182 & @xmath82 & @xmath183 + 3 & & @xmath184 & @xmath185 & 10 & @xmath186 & @xmath91 & @xmath187 & @xmath188 + 4 & 4 & @xmath189 & @xmath190 & 6 & @xmath191 & @xmath192 & @xmath127 & @xmath193      pms stars younger than @xmath15myr , traced by the cyan contours in figure[fig8 ] , are preferentially located near the central cluster ngc602a , which also contains the bulk of massive stars .",
    "furthermore , the younger pms stars are distributed in a number of small groups , some of which match the concentrations of unresolved ysos recently identified by carlson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in their panchromatic study of these regions covering wavelengths from @xmath194 to 24@xmath12 m .",
    "most of these unresolved yso sources had already been identified by gouliermis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using observations in the range from @xmath194 to 8@xmath12 m .",
    "both studies conclude that star formation is being progressively triggered from the cluster centre outwards .",
    "this is inferred from the spatial distribution of the youngest ysos ( stage i and i / ii ) , which appear to lie farther from the cluster centre than older pms stars , particularly along ridges located at the east - southeast and west of ngc602a .",
    "in fact , what these observations actually reveal is an apparent systematic age difference between the ob and pms stars near the cluster centre and the ysos along the ridges , in the sense that the latter appear younger ( by @xmath10myr , according to carlson et al .",
    "there are presently no measurements to tell whether the massive stars at the centre are responsible for the formation of the ysos along the ridges .",
    "therefore , the observations do not offer direct evidence of triggering , but rather indicate a case of sequential star formation : the episode at the centre appears to be already terminated ( possibly caused by `` fuel '' exhaustion , as witnessed for instance by the lower level of the diffuse @xmath2 emission there ) , while the one along the ridges is still ongoing .    since the groups of unresolved ysos studied by carlson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are located in regions of higher nebulosity , along the ridges surrounding ngc602a , it is in principle possible that the reported age difference between them and the stars in ngc602a be only apparent and due to a higher extinction towards the ridges .",
    "interestingly , also in our photometry most of the youngest pms stars ( those with an inferred isochronal age younger than @xmath91myr ) are located in regions of enhanced nebulosity , coinciding with the locations of the groups of unresolved ysos of carlson et al .",
    "while we have assumed the same extinction value for all stars in this region ( @xmath30 ) , as mentioned in section2 , if the extinction towards the youngest pms stars were about 2mag higher , their ages would become fully compatible with those of the other young pms objects at the cluster centre . to understand whether this is the case",
    ", we can look at the column density in these regions .    in the surroundings of ngc602",
    ", an extinction of @xmath195mag corresponds to a column density @xmath196@xmath112 ( gordon et al .",
    "2003 ) . the typical hi density in the heads of the gas pillars along the ridges is about @xmath197@xmath198 , corresponding to a column density of @xmath199@xmath112 ( panagia & de marchi , in preparation ) .",
    "this would in turn generate an extinction of order @xmath200 towards the objects near the pillars , in good agreement with their observed colours if they are indeed pms stars with an age similar to that of the objects in the cluster s centre . therefore , in principle , our youngest pms stars and the unresolved ysos of carlson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) could be highly reddened objects with ages of @xmath10myr .",
    "on the other hand , some of the reddest pms stars in the cmd do not coincide with regions of high nebulosity , and it is thus likely that they are intrinsically younger than the rest .",
    "the question , therefore , remains open as to whether the pms stars along the ridges are systematically younger than those at the cluster centre .",
    "a spectroscopic investigation of the presence and intensity of lithium absoprtion lines in these stars will be required to clarify the nature and intrinsic age of these objects .    in the meanwhile , we can set constraints on the relative ages of these young objects from their h@xmath17 luminosity @xmath69 .",
    "we list in table[tab1 ] the values of @xmath69 of all pms stars younger than 5myr located inside four sub - clusters , corresponding to local concentrations of young pms stars indicated by the numbers 1 through 4 in figure[fig8 ] .",
    "stars in regions 3 and 4 are typically redder in the cmd than those in regions 1 and 2 , and comparison with isochrones results in a younger age . an indication that these stars are indeed intrinsically younger than those in regions 1 and 2 is provided by their @xmath69 , which is a factor of 510 higher .",
    "interestingly , while the level of nebulosity is prominent in region 3 , there is very little of it in region 4 , further confirming that these latter stars are intrinsically very red and therefore intrinsically young .",
    "an independent sign of the young ages of the pms stars identified by the cyan contour lines in figure[fig8 ] comes from x - ray observations .",
    "the distribution of our young pms stars agrees rather well with the extended x - ray emission measured by oskinova et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in this field using _",
    "chandra_. for ease of comparison , we show in figure[fig9 ] the areas of extended x - ray emission by means of the contour levels ( orange lines ) obtained by oskinova et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , together with an intensity map ( green lines ) of the h@xmath17 luminosity from all our pms stars younger than 5myr .",
    "the @xmath2 intensity map differs slightly from the cyan contour lines of figure[fig8 ] , which represent the number density of pms stars . the extent of the _ chandra _ field of view is marked by the dashed lines .",
    "the negative image in the background is the one obtained in the @xmath2 band .    at",
    "the distance of ngc602 , x - ray emission from individual pms stars is too faint to be detected , but in general terms , there is an overall good match between the peaks of the x - ray and @xmath2 maps , although in the detail some differences are present .",
    "for instance , in the central cluster the peak of the x - ray emission appears to coincide with the location of the most massive stars , whereas the peak of the h@xmath17 emission from low - mass stars is @xmath201 further north .",
    "this can be understood if , as oskinova et al .",
    "( 2013 ) point out , the diffuse x - ray emission at the cluster centre originates from ( and is anyhow strongly affected by ) a wind - blown bubble . in this case",
    ", the x - ray peak will be determined by the position of the massive objects .",
    "another difference concerns region4 in table[tab1 ] , which is classified by gouliermis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) as a young cluster ( also labelled 4 in their list ) but that does not reveal diffuse x - ray emission . this apparent discrepancy , however , stems from the specific detection limit of the _ chandra _ observations of oskinova et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , namely @xmath202ergs@xmath165 ( l. oskinova , priv .",
    "comm . ) , which prevents clusters of smaller sizes to be detected above the noise .",
    "the study of the orion nebula clusters conducted by preibisch & feigelson ( 2005 ) reveals typical values of @xmath203ergs@xmath165 for @xmath169myr old stars and masses similar to those in our sample ( @xmath204m@xmath104 ) . if the same x - ray luminosity applies to stars in a lower metallicity environment such as ngc602 , only clusters with at least 10  15 young sources would be detectable in the observations of oskinova et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . at older ages , the typical x - ray luminosity decreases ( by a factor of @xmath15 at an age of @xmath161myr ;",
    "see preibisch & feigelson 2005 ) , thereby making it even more difficult to detect these sources .",
    "indeed , none of the regions in figure[fig8 ] dominated by pms stars older than 20myr , discussed in the following section , correspond to peaks in the _ chandra _ x - ray map .",
    "older pms stars , traced by the orange contours in figure[fig8 ] , mark the regions where star formation has been active in the recent past .",
    "some of these objects are seen against regions where gas is still present , for example the regions of higher nebulosity in the immediate surroundings of the central cluster ngc602a and to the west of it .",
    "the fact that much younger pms objects are also found in some of these regions indicates that there is still enough gas to sustain extended episodes of star formation , although this does not imply any triggering of star formation but rather a sequential process , in which multiple generations are born in the same location . in other regions , however , older pms stars are not surrounded by younger pms objects nor by nebulosity , suggesting that in those places star formation is no longer active .",
    "this is the case of the two small clusters , at the northern edge of the frame in figure[fig8 ] , respectively named by cignoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ngc602b ( at @xmath205 , @xmath206 ) and ngc602b2 ( at @xmath207 , @xmath208 ) .",

    "previous studies had assigned to ngc602b and ngc602b2 ages older than the stars of ngc602a , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "schmalzl et al .",
    "( 2008 ) gave upper limits of respectively 180myr and 80myr to the ages of ngc602b and ngc602b2 .",

    "cignoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) compared the cmds of the two clusters with isochrones based on franec evolutionary tracks ( chieffi & straniero 1989 ) , showing that both are compatible with ages in the range @xmath211myr .",
    "the uncertainty , however , is still very large : these authors acknowledge that the age differences between these two clusters and the central ngc602a are only due to two stars evolved off the ms in ngc602b and ngc602b2 .",
    "they conclude that , due to the paucity of stars , the ages of the two subclusters are practically indistinguishable from that of ngc602a .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of a conspicuous number of older pms stars still actively accreting , as shown in figure[fig10 ] , allows us to set much more stringent constraints on the relative ages of the two subclusters .",
    "we have derived the ages of these pms objects using the pms evolutionary tracks of the pisa group ( tognelli et al .",
    "2012 ) using a finer grid of models than the one shown in figure[fig10 ] , following the procedure explained in section4 .",
    "we find average ages of , respectively , @xmath212myr for ngc602b and @xmath213myr for ngc602b2 .",
    "based on the quoted uncertainties and even including possible systematic errors in the pms evolutionary tracks , we conclude that the two clusters are coeval and considerably older than the central cluster ngc602a .    a further indication that the two clusters have",
    "rather similar ages comes from the fraction of pms stars along the ms , i.e. the fraction of objects that have already reached the ms but that were still accreting at the time of the observations ( see figure[fig10 ] ) . for both clusters",
    "we find that this fraction is @xmath214 in the magnitude range spanned by pms stars ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "note that these values are lower limits to the actual fraction of pms stars , because they only include objects with h@xmath17 excess emission at the @xmath48 level or more at the time of the observations and because the objects without excess may also include a number of much older field stars , not related to these clusters . as mentioned before ,",
    "the fraction of objects with h@xmath17 excess emission among stars younger than 5myr is about twice as large ( @xmath216 ) , but that value too is a lower limit , since the region of the cmd where these objects fall can be populated by more massive and older objects subject to differential reddening .",
    "it is reassuring that the ratio of stars with and without h@xmath17 excess is larger for younger objects , as expected from stellar evolution , albeit not as large as the value of 28% found by de marchi et al .",

    "the physical parameters derived in section4 allow us to determine the mass accretion rate of the pms stars .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath217 is related to the accretion luminosity @xmath142 via the free - fall equation , linking the luminosity released by the impact of the accretion flow with the rate of mass accretion , according to the relationship :    @xmath218    where @xmath219 is the gravitational constant , @xmath220 the mass of the star determined above , @xmath93 its photospheric radius coming from its luminosity and effective temperature , and @xmath221 the inner radius of the accretion disc .",
    "the value of @xmath221 is rather uncertain and depends on how exactly the accretion disc is coupled with the magnetic field of the star .",
    "following gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we adopt @xmath222 for all pms objects and with this assumption we have all the parameters needed to determine @xmath4 .",
    "the median value of @xmath4 that we derive is @xmath223m@xmath104yr@xmath165 , but the @xmath4 distribution shows two clear peaks , at @xmath224m@xmath104yr@xmath165 and @xmath225m@xmath104yr@xmath165 , suggesting the presence of two different populations in the field ( see figure[fig11 ] ) .",
    "the separation between the two peaks is considerably larger than the observational uncertainties on @xmath226 .",
    "papersi and ii provide an extensive discussion of the statistical and systematic uncertainties involved in determining the mass accretion rate with this method and on its basis we conclude that the combined statistical uncertainty on @xmath4 for the stars in our field is 13% .",
    "note that this is just the statistical uncertainty , but as extensively discussed in papersi and ii systematic uncertainties can dominate , particularly the conversion from @xmath69 to @xmath142 . if the uncertainty on the latter relation were as large as dahm s ( 2008 ) work suggests , it could possibly cause a systematic effect of up to a factor of 3 on the value of @xmath227 that we obtain .",
    "however , as we explained in paper ii , this uncertainty can not be as large as the @xmath228dex value suggested by an elementary fit to the data in the limited compilation of dahm ( 2008 ) , because it has to be intrinsically smaller than the @xmath229 dex dispersion that we observe in ngc346 ( paperii ) .",
    "this will also be visible for ngc602 itself in figure[fig13 ] .",
    "nevertheless , neither statistical nor systematic uncertainties are able to explain the double peak in figure[fig11 ] .",

    "r diagram . in figure[fig4",
    "] , the size of the symbols corresponding to the pms objects was set to be proportional to @xmath4 , as per the legend in the figure .",
    "it is immediately apparent that younger objects have typically higher mass accretion rates than stars already approaching the ms , as expected from common wisdom about the theory of disc evolution .",
    "the wide range of ages and masses covered by the pms stars in our sample allows us to study in detail how the mass accretion rate varies with these parameters . to this end",
    ", we show in figure[fig12 ] the variation of @xmath4 as a function of stellar age .",
    "the pms stars in ngc602 are shown as dark diamonds ( orange in the online version ) , with a symbol size proportional to their mass .",
    "light grey diamonds in the same figure ( pink in the online version ) correspond to the pms objects identified with the same method in ngc346 in paperii , also with a size proportional to their mass .",

    "the long dashed line in figure[fig12 ] represents the best fit to the observed distribution of mass accretion rates in ngc602 .",
    "its slope ( @xmath230 ) is rather similar to the one measured in paperii for stars of similar masses and ages in ngc346 ( @xmath231 ) , but the mass accretion rate is systematically lower in ngc602 at all masses and ages . on the other hand ,",
    "both slopes are considerably less steep than the @xmath232 decline predicted by the models of hartmann et al .",

    "aguilar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . at face value",
    ", this discrepancy would seem to imply a different evolution of the mass accretion rate for pms stars in the galaxy and in the smc .",
    "however , there are two conceptual problems with the type of comparison implied by figure[fig12 ] that affect the conclusions that one can draw from it : _ ( i ) _ the masses of the individual objects must be taken explicitly into account ; and _ ( ii ) _ the graph offers just a snapshot of the observed distribution of mass accretion rates and further assumptions are needed to infer from it an evolutionary path .",
    "the first problem is easy to address , since the large size of our sample allows us to study the mass dependence of @xmath4 in a robust way . in papersi , ii and iii",
    "we found that the typical @xmath217 of pms stars in the lmc and smc is systematically higher than for pms stars of the same mass , independently of their age . to explore whether that is also the case for ngc602 , in figure[fig13 ]",
    "we split our sample in four roughly equally populated mass groups , namely @xmath233m@xmath104 , @xmath234m@xmath104 , @xmath235m@xmath104 and @xmath236m@xmath104 , and plot for each one separately the run of @xmath4 as a function of age .",
    "the slope @xmath17 and intercept @xmath237 ( at 1myr ) of the best linear fit to the data ( thick long - dashed lines ) , according to the relationship @xmath238 with the age in myr , are given in each panel together with their uncertainties .",
    "the same quantities for ngc346 are shown in light grey and the corresponding best fit is indicated by the thick short - dashed lines . as regards the slopes , the comparison shows that there is good agreement between the two clusters , although the absence of low - mass stars older than @xmath10myr in ngc346 makes the comparison difficult in panela ) .",
    "a marked difference , however , exists between the slopes of our best fits and the models of hartmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ; solid lines ) .",
    "as already discussed in papersii and iii , our stringent requirements on the h@xmath17 excess emission ( @xmath48 ) and on the corresponding h@xmath17 equivalent width ( 10 ) do in practice set a lower limit to the h@xmath17 luminosity that we accept and thus to the @xmath4 value at a given mass or age . on the other hand , comparing the observations with our @xmath48 selection thresholds ( dotted lines , independently calculated in each panel for the average @xmath239 ratio of the stars in that mass group )",
    "shows that these effects , if present , are not important in the determination of the slopes .",
    "this is also confirmed by the fact that the upper envelopes to the observed distributions of all four mass groups appear to be fully consistent with the slopes of the best fit .",
    "this is shown by the thin long - dashed and short - dashed lines ( respectively for ngc602 and ngc346 ) , which represent the best - fitting line shifted vertically by @xmath194dex .",
    "since our sample is quite rich , we can perform a multivariate least - square fit to the observations to derive the simultaneous dependence of @xmath4 on stellar mass and age .",
    "we assume a relationship of the type :    @xmath240    where @xmath6 is the age in myr , @xmath7 the mass in solar units and @xmath8 a constant , corresponding to the intercept at 1myr and 1m@xmath104 ( note that @xmath8 is similar to the parameter @xmath237 defined above , but it characterises the simultaneous fit on mass and age ) .",
    "the resulting best fit gives @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "the dependence on age and mass are very similar to those found in paperii for the pms stars in ngc346 , namely @xmath244 , @xmath245 , confirming the similarity already noticed in figure[fig13 ] . as already concluded in paperii for ngc346 , using approximate values of @xmath246 and @xmath247 results in a fit with very small residuals also for ngc602 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath8 are @xmath248 and @xmath249 respectively for ngc346 and ngc602 , reflecting the fact that the value of @xmath4 is systematically higher for pms stars in ngc346 than in ngc602 at any given mass or age .",
    "this is also visible in figure[fig13 ] , were for all mass groups the mass accretion rate in ngc346 is consistently @xmath250 times higher than in ngc602 .",
    "this difference is meaningful because both samples are large and cover a wide and overlapping range of masses and ages .",
    "as already mentioned , a similar effect had already been noticed in papersi , ii , and iii when comparing the mass accretion rates in the magellanic clouds with those of galactic stars of similar age . it was suggested in those works that the higher @xmath4 values in the magellanic clouds could be favoured by their lower metallicity . as discussed in paperiii , the radiation pressure of the forming star is expected to be less strong on lower - metallicity disc material . even though this might not be the dominant effect in the evolution of the disc , it will delay its dissipation , thereby keeping the accretion process active for a longer time . in general",
    ", a lower metallicity implies a lower opacity , temperature and viscosity for the disc , and thus a longer viscous time ( e.g. durisen et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore",
    ", low - metallicity stars can undergo significant accretion for a longer time than higher metallicity stars , in general agreement with our measurements . in this sense",
    ", one could explain the higher observed @xmath4 values in ngc346 , since its metallicity is a factor of two lower than that of ngc602 , as mentioned in section4 .",
    "the fact that the mass accretion rate values in ngc602 are about a factor of @xmath251 lower than those in ngc346 at the same mass and age strongly suggests that the mass accretion rate is a decreasing function of the metallicity .",
    "we will address this dependence in more detail in a forthcoming paper ( de marchi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , in which we compare the mass accretion rate values in ngc346 and ngc602 with those of stars in other massive clusters in the galaxy ( ngc3603 ; beccari et al . 2010 ) and lmc ( 30dor ; de marchi et al . 2011c ; paperiii ) .    in summary , our analysis indicates that the mass accretion rate scales with the age as roughly @xmath252 , with the first power of the mass and it decreases with increasing metallicity .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the evolution of @xmath4 with time is derived from the comparison of the mass accretion rates of stars of different ages . unless stars of all ages formed in similar conditions , the observed snapshot of @xmath4 values may not provide direct information on the temporal evolution of @xmath4 ( see also natta et al .",
    "in particular , differences in the density , angular momentum or metallicity of the molecular cloud as it evolves could result in different star formation properties , leading to different time scales for the accretion process and the dissipation of the circumstellar discs .",
    "furthermore , since the fraction of stars undergoing active mass accretion decreases with time ( see paperii ) , an increasingly larger number of mildly- or non - accreting stars will fall below our detection threshold ( i.e. the dashed lines in figure[fig13 ] ) , thereby resulting in a shallower slope of the @xmath4 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath6 relationship at older ages for the least massive stars . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath4 appears to scale similarly with age for different masses and in rather different environments such as ngc602 , ngc346 and the sn1987a field ( see figure[fig13 ] and paperii ) .",
    "this suggests that density and metallicity do not affect the way in which @xmath4 varies with time , but rather its instantaneous value .",
    "indeed , the average value of @xmath4 at 1myr at a specific mass , i.e. the parameter @xmath237 in figure[fig13 ] , is systematically higher at higher masses and for lower metallicity . as such ,",
    "the parameter @xmath237 is less affected by the uncertainties on the actual dependence of @xmath4 on the stellar age and can thus more effectively be used to study environmental differences of the mass accretion rate .",
    "we have studied the properties of the stellar populations in the field of ngc602 as observed with the acs camera on board the hst ( proposal nr . 10248 , principal investigator a. nota ; see carlson et al .",
    "2007 ) , using a self - consistent method that allows us to reliably identify pms stars undergoing active mass accretion , regardless of their age .",
    "the method ( see papers i and ii ) combines broad - band @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry with narrow - band @xmath2 imaging to identify all stars with excess h@xmath17 emission and to derive their accretion luminosity @xmath132 and mass accretion rate @xmath4 .",
    "this allows us to study how star formation and the accretion process have proceeded over time .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarised as follows .    1 .",
    "we have performed psf - fitting photometry on the exposures in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , covering a field of @xmath18 around the centre of ngc602 . from our photometry , we have selected all objects with a combined mean uncertainty in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands not exceeding @xmath91mag and a well defined magnitude in the @xmath2 band , for a total of 5500 sources .",
    "2 .   the cmd derived in this way reveals a well defined ms , extending from @xmath253 to @xmath254 , a subgiants branch , and a rich population of young pms stars , brighter and redder than ms objects .",
    "this variety of stellar populations , already discussed in a number of recent papers ( e.g. carlson et al .",
    "2007 ; cignoni et al . 2009 ) , attests to a complex star formation history in ngc602 . assuming a distance modulus of @xmath96 and the canonical reddening value @xmath29",
    ", we find an excellent fit to the upper ms with the padua isochrones ( fagotto et al .",
    "1994 ; marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) for metallicity @xmath100 .",
    "the same set of models applied to ngc346 , also in the smc , indicate a lower metallicity for the latter cluster , namely @xmath108 ( paper ii ) .",
    "3 .   using the self - consistent method developed in papers i and ii , we have searched for stars with h@xmath17 excess emission above the @xmath48 level with respect to the reference provided by normal stars in the same field . in this way",
    "we have identified 296 bona - fide pms stars by selecting objects with h@xmath17 equivalent width in excess of 10 .",
    "their median h@xmath17 luminosity is @xmath255l@xmath67 .",
    "we have derived effective temperatures and luminosities for these objects by comparing the photometry to the stellar atmosphere models of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in turn , the masses and ages for 276 of these objects were obtained by comparing their luminosities and effective temperatures with the pms evolutionary models of the pisa group ( tognelli et al .",
    "we adopted the metallicity @xmath256 , which is the value indicated by the comparatively young massive stars in the cluster .",
    "the masses of the 276 pms stars range from @xmath257m@xmath104to @xmath251m@xmath104 , with a median of @xmath258m@xmath104 .",
    "as regards the ages , there is a clearly bimodal distribution , with about 1/2 of the objects younger than @xmath15myr , about 1/3 older than @xmath120myr , and 50 objects at intermediate ages .",
    "this bimodality is clearly visible in the h ",
    "r diagram , where the peaks of their distributions are separated in effective temperature by @xmath117 times the width of the distributions .",
    "since our age resolution is limited to a factor of @xmath259 , stars older than @xmath120myr may actually belong to distinct episodes .",
    "vigorous episodes of mass accretion separated by longer quiescent phases , like those proposed by baraffe et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2010 ) , can be excluded as the origin of this bimodal distribution in the h ",
    "r diagram , because such a mechanism would be unable to explain the remarkably different spatial distribution of younger and older pms stars in this field .",
    "pms stars younger than @xmath15myr are distributed in groups near the cluster centre , as well as along the gas ridges surrounding it , partly overlapping with regions where unresolved groups of ysos have been detected in the mid - ir with _",
    "spitzer_. the richest amongst these groups are also detected by _",
    "chandra _ as local peaks of the diffuse x - ray emission above the detection limit of @xmath260ergs@xmath165 , although none of our sources is individually resolved by _",
    "chandra_. conversely , except for a few objects near the cluster centre , the distribution of pms stars older than @xmath161myr does not overlap with that of younger pms objects and a large fraction of older pms stars are found in two clusters located @xmath261 north of the centre .",
    "the absence of ysos and diffuse x - ray emission at these locations confirms that these are not of the same `` generation '' as younger pms stars and are intrinsically older . 7 .",
    "the relative locations of younger and older pms stars do not imply a causal effect or triggering of one generation on the other .",
    "the observations only reveal distinct , and as such most likely unrelated generations of stars in the same field .",
    "we conclude that sequential star formation is present in this field , without any clear signs of triggering .",
    "we set a lower limit to the star formation rate for the current ( @xmath262myr ) burst of @xmath263m@xmath104yr@xmath165 , while at @xmath161myr it drops by a factor of 30 to @xmath264m@xmath104yr@xmath165 .",
    "both values are necessarily lower limits , since they only account for the stars in the range @xmath265m@xmath104 that were undergoing active mass accretion at the time of the observations .",
    "although at face value the current star formation episode seems stronger , the total integrated output of the two populations is comparable . considering the @xmath155 uncertainty on relative ages in our analysis ,",
    "if the fraction of pms stars with h@xmath17 excess decays exponentially with time , the episode or episodes occurring more than @xmath120myr ago might have been even stronger than the current one .",
    "we have derived the mass accretion rate @xmath4 of all bona - fide pms stars on the basis of their h@xmath17 luminosity and the other physical parameters .",
    "the median value of @xmath4 is @xmath223m@xmath104yr@xmath165 , but the distribution is clearly bimodal , with median @xmath4 values of @xmath266m@xmath104yr@xmath165 and @xmath267m@xmath104yr@xmath165 respectively for pms stars younger than 5myr and older than 20myr .",
    "these values are about a factor of @xmath251 lower than those measured in ngc346 for pms stars of similar age .",
    "our rich sample of pms stars and its spread in mass and age allow us to study the evolution of the mass accretion rate as a function of stellar parameters . like in the case of ngc346 ( see paper ii ) , a multivariate linear regression fit shows that @xmath268 , where @xmath6 is the age of the star , @xmath7 its mass and @xmath8 the mass accretion rate for unit mass at 1myr .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is @xmath249 for ngc602 and @xmath248 for ngc346 .",
    "the fact that the mass accretion rate values in ngc602 are about a factor of @xmath251 lower than those in ngc346 at the same mass and age suggests that the mass accretion may be a decreasing function of the metallicity , as discussed in paperiii .",

    "<S> we have studied the young stellar populations in ngc602 , in the small magellanic cloud , using a novel method that we have developed to combine _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> photometry in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified about 300 pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars , all of which are still undergoing active mass accretion , and have determined their physical parameters ( effective temperature , luminosity , age , mass and mass accretion rate ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that star formation has been present in this field over the last 60myr . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we can recognise at least two clear , distinct , and prominent episodes in the recent past : one about 2myr ago , but still ongoing in regions of higher nebulosity , and one ( or more ) older than 30myr , encompassing both stars dispersed in the field and two smaller clusters located about @xmath3 north of the centre of ngc602 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative locations of younger and older pms stars do not imply a causal effect or triggering of one generation on the other . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the two episodes appears to be comparable , but the episode occurring more than 30myr ago might have been even stronger than the current one . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the evolution of the mass accretion rate @xmath4 as a function of the stellar parameters finding that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the age of the star , @xmath7 its mass and @xmath8 is a decreasing function of the metallicity . </S>"
