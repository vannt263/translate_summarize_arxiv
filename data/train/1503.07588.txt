    "terahertz ( thz ) radiation , with wavelength between 0.03 to 3 millimeters , has been found useful for applications in information and communication technology , homeland security , global environmental monitoring and ultrafast computing , to name a few @xcite .",
    "scientifically , it provides resonant access into and hence enables the probing of various of modes , such as the motion of free electrons , the rotation of molecules , the vibration of crystal lattices and the precessing of spins @xcite . with power",
    "continually being increased and duration being shorten into single or half cycle , pulsed intense thz sources are now capable of driving and steering non - resonant ultrafast processes in matter in unique ways .",
    "new phenomena are being observed , e.g. , thz harmonic generation @xcite , strong - field control of spin excitation @xcite and phase - transition @xcite , etc .",
    "the efficient generation of thz wave , however , is found still challenging .",
    "the popular approaches include optical thz generation , solid - state electronics and quantum cascade laser , which are limited either by low frequency conversion efficiency , low temperature requirement , or the lack of eigen oscillator @xcite . among these techniques ,",
    "laser air photonics is capable of generating thz field strength greater than 1 mv / cm with bandwidth of over 100 thz through plasma formation by laser ionized gaseous medium @xcite .",
    "but the mechanism of thz generation from the laser induced plasma turns out be complicated @xcite involved of wave propagation , plasma formation , oscillation and collision .",
    "for example , the thz can be emitted by the radical acceleration of the ionized electrons due to the ponderomotive force generated by the radial intensity gradient of the optical beam @xcite , or by linear mode conversion from the laser - induced plasma wakefield in inhomogeneous plasma @xcite , or by cerenkov - type mechanism from light propagating within the filament @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we restrict our study to single atom response by focusing on thz generation from gases of much lower densities in low pressure and minimizing the collective motion of plasma and its modification on the light propagation . even in this much simpler case ,",
    "the mechanism of thz emission is still under debated , partly because of the involved complex dynamics during laser interaction with gases .",
    "nevertheless , down to the fundamental origin of thz emission , it could only either be the induced current or the induced polarization .",
    "therefore two popular mechanism are proposed , a microscopic photocurrent ( pc ) model with tunneling photoionization @xcite and a third - order nonlinear model with four - wave mixing ( fwm ) @xcite .",
    "both models qualitatively agree with the experimental findings that the broken symmetry of the laser - gas interaction could enhance the field strength of the emitted thz waves by several order - of - magnitudes , when either applying a dc bias @xcite , an ac - bias by using two - color pulses @xcite or using carrier - envelop phase stabilized few - cycle pulse @xcite . as a representative case , thz emission in two - color laser fields has been investigated more intensively @xcite .",
    "so far , more evidences support the model based on photocurrent as it is found ionization is indispensable @xcite , although the physics behind photocurrent formation needs to be explored carefully @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the success of four - wave mixing model in applying to the thz detection through air - breakdown coherent detection scheme @xcite , the two models must be closely connected .",
    "the full quantum description in our previous work and others @xcite provides more insight into the mechanism of thz emission . by connecting thz emission with high harmonic generation ( hhg ) in two - color laser pulses , the dynamics responsible for thz emission",
    "is attributed to the continuum - continuum transition during laser - assisted soft collision of the ionized electron with the atomic core , while the hard collision with the atomic core leads to hhg upon recombination @xcite .    because the fundamental pulse is strong enough to induce ionization ,",
    "its interaction with the gas can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "the interaction with the second harmonic pulse is however weak which seems to be possibly treated perturbatively on the top of the non - perturbative behavior from the fundamental pulse . in this sense",
    ", the photocurrent model can be understood by another type of four - wave mixing model , but differed from the usual case that the involved lower and up states could be really populated by multiphoton ionization or tunneling ionization",
    ". therefore the two models can be unified as hinted in @xcite .",
    "although the second harmonic pulse is very weak , it serves as a gate controlling the phase of the electron wavepacket and hence breaks the left to right symmetry leading to the formation of net current and the emission of thz waves . at the same time , the out of phase high harmonic emission between adjacent half cycle in single color pulse is changed as well leading to the emission of even - order high harmonics @xcite .",
    "therefore , by controlling the phase delay between the fundamental and the second harmonic pulse , the thz and high harmonic yield can be controlled simultaneously .",
    "this enables the calibration of the optimal phase delay ( opd ) maximum thz yields and it is found that the opds related to the atomic potential @xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that the sensitivity of thz yields to the coulomb potential might be used to map atomic fields from within and to help the full characterization of the rescattering wave packet @xcite .    in the present investigation ,",
    "we explore further the effects of atomic potential and other laser parameters on the generation of thz for both a hydrogen atom and a model h@xmath0 molecule interacting with two - color pulses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the theory and model for thz generation from ionizing atoms by two - color laser pulses . in section iii , we show the calculated results and discuss the physics behind .",
    "finally we draw conclusions in section iv .",
    "under strong laser fields , the electron current is presumably contributed by photoelectrons released after ionization .",
    "when the laser photon energy is much less than the ionization potential @xmath1 , and @xmath2 where the ponderomotive energy @xmath3 is the averaged kinetic energy of an electron moving in the laser field , the mechanism of ionization can be considered as tunneling of electron through the potential barrier formed by the atomic potential and the instantaneous electric dipole potential . the instant ionization rate in the electric field of @xmath4 can be obtained using ammosov - delone - krainov ( adk ) model @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the net resulting charge and ionization potential of the atom , @xmath8 is the ionization potential of the hydrogen atom , respectively . and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "if the laser field strength is much higher such that the binding energy of the electron is higher than the height of the potential barrier , ionization can be proceed through over - the - barrier ionization ( otbi ) . in otbi range",

    "the residual current density can be found numerically by time - averaging the current after the laser turns off to cancel the @xmath35 component , @xmath37 which can be directly compared to that from the pc model .",
    "the thz spectra and yields can be computed from the dipole acceleration at the same manner given in the previous subsection .    as an example ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : thzwi_3d34_2400tt_a ] the typical thz yield modulations from an hydrogen atom in the two - color laser pulse , obtained from the tdse simulation",
    ". as the two - color phase delay varies , the modulations of terahertz yield below 10thz , 30thz and rcd takes the maximum at nearly the same optimum phase delay ( opd ) @xmath38 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thzwi_3d34_2400tt_a ] .",
    "it suggests that the rcd can be used as a good parameter characterizing the phase - delay dependence of thz yields . on the other hand ,",
    "the ionization probability is less modulated by the applied weak second harmonic pulse which indicates that the modulation of thz yield is mainly contributed by the controlling of the electron dynamics after ionization in accordance to the analysis presented in @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we show the modulation of rcd from pc model , which deviates from the tdse calculation because of the neglecting of the coulomb potential in the dynamics of free electrons ( ? ? ? ) .",

    "the fundamental laser pulse has the intensity of @xmath39 , the wavelength of 800 nm , the fwhm of 25fs , and the second harmonic intensity is 1% of fundamental pulse . ]",
    "we first examine in details how the thz yields from hydrogen atoms depend on various of parameters of the two - color laser pulses , especially we pay attention to the optimal phase - delay that maximizes the thz yields . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phad-1d2d3d24 - 1100 - 1 ] , the laser - intensity dependence of the optimal phases and the corresponding thz yields are compared between different models .",
    "the ionization potential is adjusted taking the same value of @xmath40au .",
    "when the atomic potential is the long - range coulomb potential , for either 1d , 2d or 3d calculations , the optimal phase follows the same trend that changes from 0.9@xmath41 to 0.6@xmath41 as the laser intensity varies from @xmath42 to @xmath43 where @xmath44w/@xmath45 .",
    "in contrast , the optimal phase predicted by the pc model varies little around 0.5@xmath41 ( the variation might be due to the depletion of the ground state ) .",
    "it confirms our previous investigation that pc model for thz generation fails due to the ignorance of the coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "when a short range potential rather than the coulomb potential is used , such as for the negative ions , the optimal phase of thz generation shows complete different behavior , increasing from 0.1@xmath41 to @xmath46 as the laser intensity increases as shown in fig.[fig : phad-1d2d3d24 - 1100 - 1](a ) .",

    "let us now focus on the optimal phases from the 3d calculations with coulomb potentials that are closely related to the experimental observation . as the laser intensity increases , the ionization mechanisms changes from multi - photon ionization ( mpi ) to tunneling ionization ( ti ) and then over - the - barrier ionization ( otbi ) .    in the regime of mpi",
    "when @xmath48 , terahertz generation is dominated by four - wave - mixing @xcite with prediction of the terahertz field strength given by @xmath49 and the opd is close to 0 or @xmath41 , in agreement with the numerical results at the laser intensity of @xmath44w/@xmath45 . when ti dominate ( @xmath50 ) , the soft - recollision between ionized electron with atomic core s coulomb potential play the key role @xcite . rescattering currents",
    "dominate and escaped currents vanish , and the opd shifts from @xmath41 to @xmath51 . as further increasing of the laser intensity , otbi takes over for laser intensity over @xmath52 . the non - vanishing initial longitudinal momentum cause the enhancing of the escaped part of the electron wave packet , and hence the opd is close to @xmath46 . in this case , the atomic potential might be neglected and hence the photon - current model holds predicting the terahertz field as @xmath53e_{2\\omega}\\left(t\\right)\\sin\\phi$ ] .",
    "we now turn to the dependence of optimal terahertz yields ( oty ) on the laser intensity .",
    "surprisingly , the 3d calculation and the photocurrent model give quite similar dependence .",
    "it indicates that the ionization rate is crucial in determining the yields , since the adk ionization rate is derived for 3d hydrogen atom .",
    "in contrast , the 1d and 2d calculations over - estimate the ionization yield , because the wave packet is less spreading comparing the 3d case .",
    "it is also worth noted that the yields from the short range potential are much lower for two reasons .",
    "first the tunneling ionization rate at the same ionization energy is indeed smaller for short range potential comparing to the long range potential .",
    "secondly , the laser - assisted soft collision is suppressed in the case of short range potential .",
    "next , we examine how the optimal phase delay and yields depend on the intensity ratio , @xmath54 , between the second harmonic and the fundamental pulse . as shown in fig.[fig:2w1w-3d3541jrcd2](a ) , the optimal phase delay remains nearly constant for @xmath55 for given fundamental laser intensity ( @xmath56 ) of the fundamental pulse .",
    "but as the intensity ratio increases further , the opd quickly drops to @xmath46 , because the second harmonic pulse begins to participate in the ionization process which eventually take over the ionization from the fundamental pulse .",

    "the phase - delay dependence of thz generation can be used to probe the modulation of harmonics as well .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the atomic and molecular terahertz generation with intense two - coloar laser pulses . based on the tdse simulation ,",
    "we show that thz generations is dominated by the competition between laser field and long - range coulomb field , which can affect the ionization mechanism and wave - packets dynamics . as the laser intensity increases , the opd varations demonstrate the dominated mechanisms of thz generation are changing from four - wave - mixing , rescattering currents of soft - recollision between ionized electron with atomic core , to photocurrent model without coulomb potential .",
    "when we focus on thz generation dependence on both molecular alignment angle and molecular potential , the total oty is closely similar to the angular dependence of the ionization probability , and the opd variation of several tens of attoseconds indicates that the molecular potential plays a role in the generation of thz waves .",
    "finally we show that both the alignment - dependence of the oty and opd of thz generation , can be used to contrast that of high harmonic generation , which might be used to explore further the corresponding attosecond electron dynamics experimentally .",
