    "social ( i.e. collaborative ) tagging is the practice of allowing users to annotate content .",
    "users can organize , and search content with annotations called tags . nowadays the growth in popularity of social media sites has made the area of recommender systems for social tagging systems an active and growing topic of research  @xcite .",
    "tag recommenders aim to recommend the most suited tags to a user for tagging an item .",
    "they are a salient part of the web 2.0 where applications are user - centred .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel improvement of tag recommendation .",
    "we present @xmath0 an add - on method which can fold more consistency in recommendations .",
    "furthermore it is applicable on top of many tag recommenders and is very fast to compute .",
    "the main idea behind foldcons is that the first of recommended tags computed by a tag recommender plays more important role than the rest",
    ". we may think that it is the most interesting tag since it has the highest score .",
    "thus foldcons relies on this first tag to sort the rest in order to achieve better consistency and improvement .",
    "of course , the same reasoning can be used ith the second tag , then the third one and so on .    to validate the efficiency of foldcons who chose two kinds of tag recommender as candidates .",
    "one which proves itself is the pairwise interaction tensor factorization model ( pitf ) of rendle and schmidt - thieme which wins the task 2 of ecml pkdd discovery challenge 2009  @xcite .",
    "currently one of the best tag recommenders in literature .",
    "the other is an adaptation of the network - aware search in online social bookmarking applications of  @xcite to tag recommendation , we called strec  @xcite .",
    "it is a network - based tag recommender which considers the opinions of users neighbourhood .",
    "the experiments we did on five datasets with these two tag recommenders demonstrated the efficiency of foldcons .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ prelimaries ]",
    "we present some preliminaries and describe briefly pitf and strec .",
    "section [ foldcons ] details the foldcons method . in section [ evaluation ] , we present experimentations of our proposal . finally section [ related_work ] summarizes the related work while section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "a folksonomy is a system of classification that allows its users creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize content .",
    "it is related to the event of social tagging systems .",
    "a folksonomy can be defined as a collection of a set of users @xmath1 , set of tags @xmath2 , set of items @xmath3 , and a ternary relation between them @xmath4 . a tagging triple @xmath5 means that user @xmath6 has tagged an item @xmath7 with the tag @xmath8 .",
    "a user can tag an item with one or more distinctive tags from @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that a user can tag an item with a given tag at most once .",
    "the interest of a tag @xmath8 for a given user @xmath6 and an item @xmath7 is generally estimated by a score @xmath9 .",
    "thus the purpose of a tag recommender is to compute the top-_k _ highest scoring tags for a post @xmath10 what represents its recommendations .",
    "@xmath11    in the next subsections we describe how pitf and strec model the scores of tags .",
    "factorization models are known to be among the best performing models .",
    "they are a very successful class of models for recommender systems . for tag",
    "recommendation they outperform the other approaches like folkrank and adapted pagerank  @xcite .",
    "we chose the pairwise interaction tensor factorization model ( pitf ) of rendle and schmidt - thieme in our experimentations due to its efficency  @xcite .",
    "it took the first place of the task 2 of ecml pkdd discovery challenge 2009 indeed .",
    "pitf proposes to infer pairwise ranking constraints from @xmath12 .",
    "the idea is that within a post @xmath10 , one can assume that a tag @xmath8 is preferred over another tag @xmath13 iff the tagging triple @xmath14 has been observed and @xmath15 has not been observed .",
    "pitf captures the interactions between users and tags as well as between items and tags .",
    "its model equation is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are feature matrices capturing the latent interactions .",
    "for more information regarding pitf see their paper  @xcite .",
    "we also used strec , an adaptation to tag recommendation of the network - aware search in online social bookmarking applications of  @xcite .",
    "we chose it as a candidate for network - based tag recommenders .",
    "strec is fast and efficient as presented in  @xcite .",
    "it considers that users form an undirected weighted graph @xmath21 ( i.e. the social network ) where @xmath22 is a function that associates to each edge @xmath23 a value in @xmath24 $ ] , called the proximity between @xmath6 and @xmath25 .",
    "its model score of a tag @xmath8 for a post @xmath10 is represented by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the overall frequency of tag @xmath8 for a user @xmath6 and item @xmath7 , and @xmath28 a positive monotone function . in our case",
    "we took @xmath28 as the identity function .",
    "they define the overall tag s frequency function @xmath27 as a combination of a user - network - dependent component @xmath29 and an item - dependent one @xmath30 , and as follows : @xmath31 the former component , @xmath30 , is the frequency of @xmath8 for item @xmath7 , i.e. , the number of times the item was tagged with this tag .",
    "the latter component stands for social frequency , an measure that depends on the neighborhood of user @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 allows to tune the relative importance of the social component with respect to tag s frequency .",
    "the scoring model of strec does not take into account only the close neighborhood of user @xmath6 ( i.e. the other users directly connected to her ) .",
    "but it extends it to deal also with users that are indirectly connected to her , following a natural interpretation that user links ( e.g. , similarity ) are , at least to some extent , transitive . thus considering that each neighbour brings her own weight ( proximity ) to the score of a tag , the measure of tag s social frequency",
    "is defined as follows : @xmath33    as one may notice , strec does not regard the use of the tag by the user for tagging items ( as for the item with the tag s frequency ) but it considers the opinions of the user s neighbours instead .",
    "in this section , we present our add - on method for improving tag recommendation , we called @xmath0 .",
    "it may be used on top of many tag recommenders .",
    "+ its functioning is to ask recommendations of a given tag recommender about a post @xmath10 , and improve them before to leave to the user the final top-_k _ recommended tags . therefore it asks for a number of tags greater than @xmath34 .",
    "then it re - ranks them and keeps the @xmath34 first tags as the final recommendations .",
    "the sequel of this section details the foldcons method besides introducing some defintions .",
    "[ def_tag_lists ] a tag s users list @xmath35 is the set of users who used the tag @xmath8 .",
    "a tag s items list @xmath36 so is the set of items tagged by the tag @xmath8 .",
    "the pairwise confidence measure , @xmath37 , is defined between to tags @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "it determines to some extent the interest to use @xmath13 in addition to @xmath8 .",
    "pcm takes into account both users and items as defined as follows @xmath38    the pairwise confidence measure mines association rules between tags from two dimensions : users and items .",
    "this allows us to account the frequency of tags co - occurences both for the user and item of a post .",
    "let us notice there we do not currently weight their contributions in the sum but this is a possibility .",
    "foldcons works simply as an add - on tool which takes in entry tags from a tag recommender sorted by their scores and returns a short list of final recommended tags .",
    "its challenge is to improve the recommendations it received by giving a better top-_k_.    let us denote by @xmath39 the list of recommended tags received from a given tag recommender .",
    "to simply we consider that @xmath39 is sorted and its highest scoring tag is @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "let us emphasize here we assign more attention to @xmath40 $ ] than the rest of tags in @xmath39 due to the fact that it is the best choice given by the tag recommender .",
    "therefore we fix it and compute the pairwaise confidence measures of all the tags compared to it .",
    "then we sort @xmath39 again with the new scoring function for each of its tags @xmath8    @xmath41 \\rightarrow t ) ) \\cdot score(t|u , i)$ ]    thus we introduce a certain consistency in the recommendations by taking account the tags which appear generally next to the first recommended tag in @xmath39 from both the user s point of view and the one of the item .",
    "this approach improves noticeably the quality of recommendations as shown in our experimentations .",
    "morever , as pcm at best doubles the initial score of a tag ( i.e. @xmath42 $ ] ) , we can keep in entry only the tags whose scores exceed or equal the half - score of the last tag in the top-_k _ of @xmath39 .",
    "indeed the other tags can not change the top-_k_.      some tag recommenders are not both user and item - centred .",
    "strec may be an example . despite",
    "it takes into account the opinions of a user s neighbourhood , it does not consider the user s frequent used tags . in these cases we experimented that the application of foldcons may slightly fall to improve the recommendations in the user or item - dimension .",
    "thus we adapted foldcons to these cases .",
    "depending on the recommender we consider the user profile and/or the item one , we define below .",
    "[ def_user_item_profils ] a user profile @xmath43 is the set of all the tags used by user @xmath6 to tag items .",
    "an item profile @xmath44 so is the set of tags used to annotate item @xmath7 .",
    "we determine if foldcons brings better recommendations by estimating its contribution .",
    "we take account of the number of common tags between the top-_k _ recommended tags and the item and/or the user profile before and after its computation .",
    "the difference represents the contribution of foldcons .",
    "the recommendations of foldcons are considered better when its contributions are positive else the list of tags @xmath39 remains unchanged .",
    "this approach ensures , almost in all cases , that the recommendation quality does not decrease after application of foldcons when recommenders are not both user and item - centred .",
    "we chose five datasets from four online systems : del.icio.us , movielens , last.fm , and bibsonomy .    we take the ones of del.icio.us , movielens , and last.fm from _ hetrec 2011 _",
    "@xcite and the two other ones from bibsonomy : a post - core at level 5 and a one at level 2  @xcite .",
    "we call them respectively @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "@xmath46 is the one of the task 2 of ecml pkdd discovery challenge 2009 .",
    "this task was especially intended for methods relying on a graph structure of the training data only .",
    "the user , item , and tags of each post in the test data are all contained in the training data s , a post - core at level 2.let us remaind that a post - core at level @xmath47 is a subset of a folksonomy with the property , that _ each user , tag and item has / occurs in at least @xmath47 times_.table [ datasets_tab ] presents the caracteristics of these datasets .",
    ".[datasets_tab ] caracteristics of the datasets [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     despite that is not always the case , the no - weighted combination of the two components proves to be better than the use of one of these component separately .",
    "this confirm our initial choice .",
    "morever we think that it would be more obvious when using weighted linear combinations .",
    "finding suited tags to put in the same recommendations is an important point for tag recommendation .",
    "many approaches and methods can be used to achieve this point .",
    "we can cite the work of lipczak which focused on content - based tag recommenders  @xcite .",
    "his approach consists in extracting basic tags from the content of items ( e.g. the item title ) , then extending the set of potential recommendations by related tags proposed by a lexicon based on co - occurrences of tags within item s posts .",
    "he solves these co - occurences based on association rules mining .",
    "wang et al . did a similar work enough but first applied a tf - idf algorithm on the description of the item content , in order to extract keywords of the item  @xcite .",
    "based on the top keywords , they utilize association rules from history records in order to find the most probable tags to recommend . in addition , if the item has been tagged before by other users or the user has tagged other items before , then history information is also exploited to find the most appropriate recommendations .",
    "+ many others works could be cited .",
    "however due to the length of the paper we can not cite them and furthermore they are generally closed approaches .",
    "they are for the most part content - dependent . what is not the case of foldcons which mines association rules directly on a primary list of candidate tags , then sort this list again .",
    "our experimentations showed the effectiveness of this method .",
    "we proposed an add - on method to improve the recommendations of tag recommender .",
    "we mine association rules on top of their recommendations , then we sort them again thanks to their confidence scores compared to the first tag .",
    "thus we introduce a certain consistency inside the recommendations by taking account of tags which appear generally next to the first candidate tag in the initial recommended list .",
    "this method improves up to 5% the recommendations as shown by our experimentations when the users have not in average a small number of posts .",
    "we would like to thank steffen rendle for the software _ tagrec _ and also the knowledge and data engineering group of university of kassel especially for the benchmark folksonomy data ( bibsonomy , version of april 30th , 2007 ) .",
