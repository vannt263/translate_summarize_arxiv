    "the geometric albedo of a planetary body illuminated by the sun is the ratio of its brightness observed at zero phase angle ( i.e. , measured in conditions of ideal solar opposition ) to that of an idealized flat , lambertian disk having the same cross - section .",
    "the word `` albedo '' comes from the latin word _ albus _ , which means `` white '' .",
    "according to its definition , therefore , the geometric albedo is the parameter used to indicate whether the surface of a given object illuminated by the sun appears to be dark or bright .",
    "the albedo is wavelength dependent . in planetary science",
    ", the geometric albedo has been traditionally measured in the standard johnson @xmath0 band centered around 0.55 @xmath1 m , and it is usually indicated in the literature using the symbol @xmath2 .    the geometric albedo is a parameter of primary importance .",
    "being an optical property of a sunlight - scattering surface , it must depend on composition , as well as on other properties characterizing the surface at different size scales , including macro- and micro - texture and porosity .",
    "all these properties are the product of the overall history of an object s surface , and are determined by the interplay of phenomena as complex as collisions , local cratering , micro - seismology , space weathering , thermal phenomena , just to mention a few relevant processes .",
    "the fine structure and composition of the surface affects properties of the optical emission which determine the results of many observing techniques , including photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "it is particularly important in determining the state of polarization of the scattered sunlight in different illumination conditions , this being the main subject of this paper .",
    "the geometric albedo is also a fundamental parameter when one wants to determine the size of a small solar system body , having at disposal photometric measurements at visible wavelengths . in particular ,",
    "a measurement of brightness in @xmath0 light is not sufficient to discriminate between a large , dark object and a small , bright one , if the albedo is unknown .",
    "geometric albedo should not be confused with the so - called bond ( or spherical ) albedo .",
    "the bond albedo is the fraction of incident sunlight that is scattered in all directions and at all wavelengths .",
    "the bond albedo is needed to estimate what fraction of incident radiation is actually absorbed , and therefore contributes to the energy balance of the body determining its temperature .",
    "it is possible to define the bond albedo at any given wavelenght @xmath3 , e.g. , @xmath4 for that at the v - band of the johnson ubv system , as @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the geometric albedo at wavelength @xmath3 , and @xmath7 is the so - called phase integral , first defined by @xcite as the integral of the directionally scattered flux , integrated over all directions : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the disk - integrated brightness of the object at phase angle @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately , a determination of the phase integral , which requires in principle many measurements of the scattered sunlight at visible wavelengths obtained in different illumination conditions , is very hard to achieve , and is seldom available in practice .",
    "asteroid sizes and albedos have been historically determined mostly by means of measurements of the thermal flux at mid - ir wavelengths ( the so - called thermal radiometry technique ) , generally using space - based platforms like the iras and , more recently , the wise @xcite and akari @xcite satellites . at thermal ir wavelengths",
    "the received flux depends primarily on the size of the emitting object , and only weakly on the albedo . in particular",
    ", the bond albedo determines the fraction of the incident sunlight which is absorbed by the surface and is available to raise the temperature of the body .",
    "the temperature , in turn , determines the spectrum of the thermal emission in the ir .",
    "since the bond albedo of the asteroids is usually fairly low ( in general well below @xmath11% ) , most of the incident solar flux is actually absorbed by the body , and the intensity of the thermal flux turns out to be mostly dependent on the size , whereas the dependence upon relatively small differences in albedo is much weaker .",
    "moreover , the computation of the geometric albedo from the bond albedo , as mentioned above , would require a knowledge of the phase integral , which is essentially unknown in the vast majority of cases . as a consequence , it is not really possible to _ solve _ simultaneously for size and albedo in practical applications of the thermal radiometry technique .",
    "what is normally done is to derive the size from thermal ir data alone ( assuming also that the objects have spherical shapes ) , and then determine the geometric albedo by using the known relation @xmath12 [ eqn : dhpv ] where @xmath13 is the diameter expressed in km ( supposing that the object is spherical ) , @xmath14 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath2 is the geometric albedo .",
    "to do so properly , at least some @xmath0 magnitude measurements obtained during the same apparition in which the thermal flux of the object is measured , would be needed , in order to derive from them a reliable value of the absolute magnitude @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately , in the real world no measurements of the @xmath0 flux are really done in thermal radiometry campaigns , and @xmath14 is directly taken from available catalogues . in turn , these @xmath14 values are derived from @xmath0 magnitude data ( often of quite poor photometric quality ) , mostly obtained in different observing circumstances , and using a photometric model of the variation of @xmath0 magnitude as a function of phase angle . as mentioned by several authors , ( see , for instance ,",
    "* ) , the magnitude - phase relation for asteroids is described by means of parameters which are generally poorly known , and this introduces further errors in the geometric albedo determination .    in summary , it is difficult to obtain very accurate determinations of the geometric albedo of an asteroid based on thermal radiometry measurements",
    ". based on the relation described by eq.@xmath15[eqn : dhpv ] the relative uncertainty on the albedo should be twice the relative error on the size , in ideal conditions . in practice , values as high as 50% in geometric albedo , or even more for small and faint objects , are common even when the relative error on the size is of the order of @xmath16% .",
    "the best results require measurements of the thermal flux to be obtained at different wavelengths in the thermal ir , an acceptable knowledge of the variation of @xmath0 magnitude with phase , and detailed thermo - physical models which can be developed when a wealth of physical data is available from different observing techniques ( including a knowledge of the shape and spin axis orientation ) .    in this paper , we focus on another possible option to obtain estimates of the geometric albedo of asteroids , or other atmosphereless solar system bodies .",
    "this is based on measurements of the state of polarization of the sunlight scattered by the surface in different illumination conditions , and on the existence of empirical relations between geometric albedo and polarimetric properties .",
    "our present analysis is mainly devoted to summarize the state of the art of this application of asteroid polarimetry , and to provide one or more updated forms of the albedo - polarization relationship , sufficiently accurate to be used in practical applications of asteroid polarimetry by the largest possible number of researchers in the future .",
    "we analyze the current observational evidence taking into account an extensive data set available in the literature , including also observations carried out mostly at the complejo astronomico el leoncito ( san juan , argentina ) , that have been published only recently @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the albedo from polarimetric data is a challenging problem which has been open for a long time . in the present paper",
    "we take into account both traditional approaches as well as new possible developments suggested by the data at our disposal .",
    "classical asteroid polarimetry consists of measurements of the linear polarization of the light received from asteroids observed at different phase angles .",
    "the observations give directly the degree of linear polarization and the position angle of the plane of polarization .",
    "this is usually measured with respect to the orientation of the direction perpendicular to the scattering plane , namely the plane containing the sun , the observer and the target . according to elementary physical considerations ( fresnel reflection ) one should expect the scattered sunlight emerging from the surface of an atmosphereless planetary body to be linearly polarized along the direction perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "this expectation is only partly confirmed by the observations .",
    "the asteroid light at visible wavelengths turns out to be , as expected , in a state of partial linear polarization , but in different observing circumstances the plane of linear polarization is found to be either perpendicular ( as expected ) or parallel ( and this is _ a priori _ unexpected ) to the scattering plane .",
    "it is therefore customary in asteroid polarimetry to express the degree of polarization as the ratio of the difference of intensity of light beam component @xmath17 having the electric vector aligned along the plane perpendicular to the scattering plane minus the intensity @xmath18 of the component having the electric vector aligned parallel to that plane , divided by the sum of the two intensities .",
    "this parameter is usually indicated as @xmath19  in the literature and is given by : @xmath20    according to its definition , the module of @xmath19  is the degree of linear polarization of the received light as explained in elementary textbooks in physics ( because @xmath17 and @xmath18 are found to be coincident with @xmath21 and @xmath22 measured through a polaroid ) , but the sign of @xmath19  can be either positive or negative , depending on whether @xmath21 corresponds to @xmath17 , as should be expected based on elementary physics , a situation normally referred to as `` positive polarization '' .",
    "when @xmath21 is found to correspond to @xmath18 , @xmath19  becomes negative , and this situation is called `` negative polarization '' .    it is important to note that we will always use the @xmath19  parameter throughout this paper every time we will refer to asteroid polarimetric measurements . its value will always be expressed ( and plotted in our figures ) in percent ( % ) .",
    "we also note that asteroids are not strongly polarized objects .",
    "the degree of linear polarization turns out to be usually below @xmath23 .",
    "examples of phase - polarization curves obtained for four large main belt asteroids belonging to different taxonomic classes : top left : the dwarf planet ( 1 ) ceres ( @xmath24-class ) ; top right : ( 4 ) vesta ( @xmath0-class ) ; bottom left : ( 6 ) hebe ( @xmath25-class ) ; bottom right : ( 21 ) lutetia ( for a long time considered to belong to the old @xmath26 class , now included in the @xmath27 complex ) .",
    "open symbols refer to data available in the literature .",
    "full symbols in the plots identify observations obtained at the casleo observatory . most of them have been published only recently @xcite .",
    "the best - fit lines correspond to the exponential - linear relation discussed in sect .",
    "[ bestfit ] . , width=336 ]    in asteroid polarimetry , by measuring @xmath19  at different epochs , corresponding to different values of the phase angle , it is possible to obtain the so - called _ phase - polarization curves_. some examples are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "many data plotted in this figure have been obtained during several observing campaigns carried out at casleo ( complejo astronomico el leoncito ) in the province of san juan ( argentina ) , using the 2.15 m sahade telescope @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , it is easy to see that asteroids belonging to very different taxonomic classes tend to exhibit phase - polarization curves which share in general terms a same kind of general morphology , but with differences which can be easily seen , and represent some classical results of asteroid polarimetry ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , all the curves are characterized by a `` negative polarization branch '' , extending over an interval of phase angles between @xmath28 degrees up to a value @xmath29 which is commonly found to be around @xmath30 of phase ( `` inversion angle '' ) .",
    "the extreme value of polarization in the negative branch is traditionally indicated as @xmath31 . around the inversion angle",
    "the trend of @xmath19  as a function of phase angle is mostly linear , and the slope of this linear increase is commonly indicated as @xmath32 .",
    "the interval of phase angles which is accessible to earth - based observers extends in the best cases little over @xmath33 when observing main belt asteroids ( the possible observing circumstances being determined by the orbital elements of the objects ) .",
    "the interval of possible phase angles extends up to much larger values in the case of objects which can be observed much closer to the earth , as in the case of many near - earth asteroids .",
    "from fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] , it is evident that , at the same phase angle , different objects exhibit different degrees of polarization . some objects are more polarized than others .",
    "this can be interpreted in very general terms as being a consequence of the classical umov effect @xcite , which states that the degree of polarization tends to be inversely proportional to the albedo , according also to laboratory experiments .",
    "the task of determining the albedo based on available phase - polarization curves is important in asteroid science .",
    "the foundations have been laid long ago in some classical papers , like @xcite and @xcite . since then , several authors have tackled the same problem , with analyzes based on new sets of observations and/or laboratory experiments . the idea is to determine some suitable relation between the distinctive features of the phase - polarization curves of some selected sources , and their albedo , assumed to be known _ a priori _ with good accuracy .",
    "the set of calibration objects must also be representative of the whole population .",
    "we can not assume _ a priori _ that all asteroids ( which are a quite heterogeneous population ) , must respect a unique relation between albedo and polarization properties . only _ a posteriori _ can we assess whether it is possible to accurately derive the albedo using a unique relationship independent on the taxonomic class .",
    "the main task is therefore to find a suitable representation of such a relation between albedo and polarization , to be tested over the maximum possible number of calibration objects belonging to different taxonomic classes .    in this respect",
    ", one must analyze available polarimetric data for the largest possible sample of objects having a well - known albedo , in order to find evidence of some general and satisfactorily accurate relation between albedo and polarimetric properties .",
    "unfortunately , it is not so easy to implement this simple approach in practical terms .",
    "the use of laboratory experiments , based in particular on polarimetric measurements of meteorite samples , for calibration purposes seems to be natural , and was adopted in the 70s , but it is not exempt from problems .",
    "there are some technical difficulties , including the need of observing the specimens at zero phase angle to measure their albedos , something which is in general not a trivial task . in a classical paper",
    ", @xcite also mentioned some problems in correctly assessing the instrumental polarization in the lab .",
    "another general problem is to ensure that the used meteorite samples are really representative of the behavior of asteroids as they appear to remote observers .",
    "unfortunately , the meteorite samples have to be treated to reproduce the texture of their asteroid parent bodies . for instance",
    ", @xcite noted that to find similarities between the phase - polarization curves of asteroids and meteorite samples , the latter have to be first crushed , and the way to do that has consequences on the derived polarization properties .",
    "moreover , the authors noticed how difficult it is to eliminate from meteorite samples any source of terrestrial , post - impact alteration .",
    "for all these reasons , starting from the 90s most attempts of calibration of the albedo - polarization relation have been based on the direct use of asteroid albedo values obtained from other techniques of remote observation .",
    "several papers have been based on the idea of using for calibration purposes some sets of asteroids for which the geometric albedo had been derived from thermal radiometry observations , mostly consisting of old iras measurements , or , more recently , wise data .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being able to use for calibration many objects belonging to practically all known taxonomic classes .",
    "there are , however , several problems .",
    "first , albedos derived from thermal ir data are model - dependent .",
    "they depend on the choice of some parameters , which are needed to simulate the distribution of temperature on the asteroid surface , and the dependence of the irradiated thermal flux in different directions . apart from a limited number of cases , albedo values determined by thermal radiometry data , particularly for objects for which we have little information coming from other sources ,",
    "are simply too inaccurate for the purposes of a robust calibration .",
    "this is a consequence of the problems discussed in section [ intro ] concerning the general lack of simultaneous photometric data at visible wavelengths , and the consequent use of values of absolute magnitude that are affected by large errors . to add some confusion , in the past the catalog of iras - based asteroid albedos changed with time . in particular , the first published catalog of iras albedo values @xcite had been built using thermal ir data coupled with estimated absolute magnitudes computed prior the introduction of the ( @xmath14 , @xmath24 ) asteroid photometric system . using these data",
    ", @xcite derived a first set of values for the calibration parameters included in the so - called _ slope - albedo _ law ( see section [ classical ] ) .",
    "subsequently , a new iras albedo catalog was produced using absolute magnitudes expressed in the ( @xmath14 , @xmath24 ) system @xcite , and these values were used by @xcite to derive an alternative calibration of the slope - albedo law .",
    "this problem should be expected to arise again , due to the fact that iau has recently recommended the use of a new photometric system ( @xmath34 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that the albedo catalogues obtained using iras , and more recently , wise data , should be updated again .",
    "currently , different authors use different calibrations available in the literature , including , in addition to those just mentioned above , also much older calibrations by @xcite and @xcite , which were mainly based on laboratory experiments .",
    "this is not an ideal situation , and one of the major goals of this paper is just to provide one or more updated forms of the albedo - polarization relationship , to be used by most researchers in the future , depending on the polarimetric data at their disposal .",
    "@xcite proposed a new kind of calibration based on different polarimetric parameters and using a sample of @xmath35 asteroids for which the albedo has been estimated from wise thermal radiometry data .",
    "in many cases , the objects were observed by wise at fairly large phase angles , and the problem of assigning in these cases reliable values of corresponding magnitude in the visible is particularly difficult . as a consequence , in this paper we will also make a new test of the @xcite approach , but using a different sample of objects having albedos not derived from thermal radiometry data ( see section [ altapp ] ) .",
    "@xcite proposed to use for calibration purposes a limited sample of asteroids for which both the size is known with extremely high accuracy , and also the absolute magnitude in the visible is well known , being based on large data sets of available photometric data . as for the size ,",
    "the most accurate values are certainly those obtained either _ in situ _ by space probes , or those obtained by accurate observations of stellar occultations",
    ". at least for some of these objects , also the absolute magnitude values listed in the catalogs can be reasonably reliable , although we should always remember that the absolute magnitude is not , strictly speaking , a fixed parameter , but it varies at different epochs , being dependent on the varying aspect angle of the object .",
    "the aspect angle determines the extent of the cross - section of the illuminated surface visible by the observer , and varies at different apparitions .",
    "this variation of visible cross - section depends on the overall shape of the object ( it is zero for an ideal sphere ) and on the orientation of the rotation axis .    limiting our analysis to the best - observed objects , for which the size and the absolute magnitude are supposed to be well known",
    ", the albedo @xmath2 can be derived using the relation between size , albedo and absolute magnitude ( eq.@xmath15[eqn : dhpv ] )    the list of objects with reliable albedo proposed by @xcite includes @xmath36 objects . among them , there are some of the largest and most observed asteroids , including ( 1 ) ceres , ( 2 ) pallas , ( 3 ) juno and ( 4 ) vesta .",
    "we note that in the case of ( 4 ) vesta , however , we use a different value of albedo , namely @xmath37 , based on the most recent , and very accurate value of size measured _ in situ _ by the dawn probe .",
    "the uncertainty in albedo for this asteroid depends on the fact that the disk - integrated albedo tends to change at different rotation angles @xcite .",
    "many objects of the @xcite list are much fainter ( including some small targets of space missions ) and several have never been observed in polarimetry . in this paper",
    "we follow the approach indicated by @xcite .",
    "this does not mean that we are not aware of some problems : first , we know that the @xcite object list is now fairly old and needs an updating .",
    "this includes both considering a larger , currently available set of high - quality stellar occultation data , as well as using more accurate values of the absolute magnitude , to be computed according to the new ( @xmath14 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) photometric system adopted by the international astronomical union .",
    "we plan to produce an updated and possibly longer list of calibration targets in the near future , but we postpone this to a separate paper . in our present work we lay the foundations for any future analysis taking profit of a larger list of reliable asteroid albedos .",
    "the still limited data base of asteroid polarimetric observations is for the moment the main limiting factor for the investigations in this field .",
    "we have long been involved in an observing program of polarimetric observations of asteroids belonging to the @xcite list , in order to improve significantly the coverage of the phase - polarization curves for these objects .",
    "so far , we have been able to obtain decent phase - polarization curves for only a limited sample of the whole list , taking also into account that some objects would require the availability of larger telescopes and/or better detectors , as well as a larger amount of dedicated observing time .",
    "the results presented in this paper , which follow a previous preliminary analysis published by @xcite , are already sufficient to find an updated set of calibration parameters for the classical form of the slope - albedo law adopted by most authors in the past .",
    "the new data also allow us to explore new possible ways to express the relation between albedo and polarimetric properties , which will be probably the future in this field once the data - set of asteroid polarimetric measurements will grow significantly in a hopefully not - too distant future .",
    "asteroids of the list of @xcite for which a computation of the polarimetric slope is possible based on measurements obtained so far .",
    "objects for which we have at disposal at least @xmath16 polarimetric measurements are indicated by full , black symbols .",
    "objects having a number of observations between @xmath40 and @xmath16 are displayed using open , green symbols .",
    "the obtained polarimetric slopes of all the objects in this plot have been used in the computation of the linear best - fit that is plotted together with the individual data .",
    "the corresponding values of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 calibration coefficients are also indicated.,width=332 ]",
    "in practically all papers devoted in the past to this subject , the relation between geometric albedo and polarimetric properties has been assumed to be one of the following ones : @xmath43 @xmath44 in eq.@xmath15([eqn : hpv ] ) , which was originally proposed as early as in the 70s in the first pioneering investigations by b. zellner and coworkers , @xmath32 is the so - called polarimetric slope , namely the slope of the linear variation of @xmath19  as a function of phase angle , measured at the inversion angle ( see section [ data ] ) . in eq.@xmath15([eqn : pminpv ] ) , the polarimetric parameter is instead @xmath45 , namely the extreme value of negative polarization .",
    "most investigations available in the literature ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , have used eq.@xmath15([eqn : hpv ] ) , which is normally known as the _ slope - albedo _ relation , or law .",
    "in fact , according to many authors , eq.@xmath15[eqn : pminpv ] leads to less ( or much less ) accurate results than eq.@xmath15[eqn : hpv ] .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ bestfit ] , while in the rest of this section we will focus on eq.@xmath15[eqn : hpv ] .",
    "the measurement of the polarimetric slope @xmath32 should be done , in principle , by measuring the degree of linear polarization @xmath19  in a narrow interval of phase angles surrounding the inversion angle . in practical terms , however , the observers rarely have at disposal an ideal coverage of the phase - polarization curve , and often the polarimetric slope is derived by making a linear fit of a few @xmath19measurements , located not so close to the inversion angle as one would generally hope .",
    "we will see in the next sections some new possible approach to derive @xmath32 when one has at disposal a good coverage of the phase - polarization curve . for the moment",
    ", however , in a first treatment of available polarimetric data for the objects of the @xcite list , we adopt the usual techniques , and we derive @xmath32 from a linear least - squares fit of all available @xmath19  data .",
    "in particular , in order to use only homogeneous and high - quality data :    * we limit our analysis to polarimetric measurements obtained in the standard @xmath0 filter .",
    "* we only use values of linear polarization @xmath19  having nominal errors less than @xmath46% .",
    "* we use only polarimetric measurements obtained at phase angles larger than or equal to @xmath47 of phase , a value generally well beyond the phase corresponding to @xmath31 , and in a region of the negative polarization branch where @xmath19  starts to increase linearly with phase . *",
    "we require to have at least @xmath40 accepted measurements , and that the interval of phase angles covered by the data is not less than @xmath48 .",
    "a smaller number of measurements , and a narrower interval of covered phase angles , would make the adopted polarimetric slopes more uncertain .",
    "the use of @xmath19  data having fairly large error bars , up to 0.2 , is suggested by the general scarcity of polarimetric data , but the effect of low - quality measurements is mitigated because in the computation of the best - fit curves , we weight the data according to the inverse of the square of their associated errors .",
    "as for the nominal errors of the @xcite albedos , which are not explicitly listed by the authors , we derived them using the quality codes listed in the above paper , according to their meaning as indicated by the authors .    in this way , we were able to compute reliable polarimetric slopes for @xmath49 calibration objects .",
    "taking the corresponding albedos from the @xcite paper , we can plot @xmath32 as a function of albedo , in a log - log scale , from which the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 in eq.@xmath15([eqn : hpv ] ) can be derived using simple least - squares computations .",
    "the nominal errors of both the calibration albedos and of the derived polarization slopes were taken into account in the computation .",
    "the results , including also the obtained values of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 calibration parameters , are shown in fig.@xmath15[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] .",
    "the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , together with their corresponding errors , are also given in table 1 .",
    "a few considerations are suggested by looking at fig.@xmath50[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] .",
    "first , the linear best - fit solution seems , as a first approximation , fairly reasonable .",
    "objects observed in our campaign , derived using our new calibration coefficients of the slope - albedo relation , and the corresponding albedo values given by @xcite .",
    "the meaning of the symbols is the same as in fig.@xmath50[fig : slopealbloglogfit],width=332 ]     in albedo .",
    "the meaning of the symbols is the same as in fig.@xmath50[fig : slopealbloglogfit].,width=332 ]        this seems to be confirmed by figure [ fig : albalb ] , where the albedo values of the objects considered in our analysis , as they can be derived from our updated determination of the calibration coefficients , are plotted _ versus _ the corresponding albedo values determined by @xcite . in fig.@xmath50[fig : diffalb ] we show for each object the difference between the albedo value obtained from the polarimetric slope and the albedo value given by @xcite . from figs.@xmath50[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] to [ fig : diffalb ] , it can be seen that the discrepancies are generally low in absolute terms , being mostly below @xmath51 , as shown in fig.@xmath50[fig : diffalb ] .",
    "the error bars of the obtained albedo values tend to increase with albedo , but this should be expected , because the slope - albedo relation ( eq.@xmath50[eqn : hpv ] ) implies that the error of @xmath2 must increase linearly with @xmath2 itself . and @xmath52 , by solving by a linear least - squares technique eq.@xmath50[eqn : hpv ] and determining the corresponding error @xmath53 of @xmath54 , it is easy to see that the corresponding error @xmath55 turns out to be given by @xmath56    one object turns out to have a polarimetrically - derived albedo that is significantly discrepant , namely ( 2 ) pallas , ( the point which is located at the highest vertical distance above the best - fit line in fig.@xmath15[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] ) .",
    "the @xcite albedo value of this asteroid , @xmath57 , seems to be noticeably high for an object belonging to the @xmath58 taxonomic class , which is generally supposed to include low - albedo asteroids . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xcite albedo of pallas is also substantially confirmed by more recent results based on wise data @xcite .",
    "the albedo value derived from the polarimetric slope turns out to be @xmath59 , which would appear to be more in agreement with expectations for a body belonging to the low - albedo , @xmath58 class .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite observed a large sample of @xmath58-class objects and found a continuous variation of near - ir spectral slopes , possibly suggesting a variety of different compositions .",
    "this might be a consequence of the fact that the modern @xmath58 class includes also some asteroids ( the old @xmath60 class of tholen , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that in the 80s were kept separate based on their behaviour at the shortest wavelengths , which are no longer covered in the most modern spectroscopic investigations .",
    "one should also take into account that the surface properties of the largest asteroids like ( 2 ) pallas , which retain a larger fraction of the material excavated in most impacts , can be different from those of smaller asteroids which lose a much larger fraction of the impact debris from most collisions to space .",
    "we already know , based on their different ir beaming parameters , that the surfaces of large and smaller asteroids can be significantly different . in any case , polarimetry seems to indicate for ( 2 ) pallas a low albedo . in the absence of any new , updated albedo and/or absolute magnitude value for this object coming from other sources , we accept this discrepancy .",
    "another important problem which is most apparent in fig.@xmath50[fig : albalb ] concerns the asteroid ( 64 ) angelina , namely the object having the highest albedo value in our sample .",
    "the value given by @xcite for this object is @xmath61 . according to our new calibration",
    ", the resulting albedo turns out to be @xmath62 , marginally in agreement with the @xcite value .",
    "the problem here is not this discrepancy _ per se _ , but rather the fact that , as shown in fig.@xmath50[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] , in the high - albedo domain our new calibration tends to assign albedo values increasingly close to @xmath63 to asteroids having increasingly shallower polarimetric slopes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lupcelfit ] we show a comparison between our new slope - albedo relation ( shown in red in the plot ) and the most recent previous calibration , namely that of @xcite ( black line ) . though not being visually very different , an effect of the adopted log - log scale , the new calibration tends , at high values of albedo , to stay well above the values predicted by the previous calibration .",
    "we will show in a separate paper that in the case of ( 44 ) nysa , an asteroid belonging to the high - albedo @xmath64 class , our new calibration assigns to this asteroid an albedo of about @xmath65 , which seems exceedingly high to be credible for a rocky body . in the domain of low - albedo asteroids , the larger steepness of the new best - fit line produces only a marginally better fit with respect to the previous calibration .",
    "this problem of an exceedingly high slope of our linear calibration seems to be connected with another major problem that is apparent by looking at fig.@xmath50[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] .",
    "this is the fact that at low albedo , the data look rather noisy , with some data points , having polarimetric slopes between @xmath46%/deg and @xmath66 % /deg , which are located well above or below the linear best - fit of the whole dataset . trying to fit all the data ,",
    "one is led to accept a linear best - fit whose steepness is a consequence of the presence of the lowest - albedo asteroids .",
    "this is a problem that has been known since a long time , and we will discuss it more extensively in the following subsection .",
    "[ fig : slopealbloglogfit ] , but here the objects having albedo smaller than @xmath67 ( displayed here using open squares ) were not used to derive the displayed linear best - fit .",

    "this is an old - debated subject , namely whether there is evidence of a saturation of the slope -albedo law at small albedo values .",
    "this kind of possible saturation is also much more evident in @xmath31 - albedo data , as we will see in section [ bestfit ] .    what happens if we exlude from our analysis low - albedo asteroids ?",
    "figure [ fig : slopealbbrightloglogfit ] shows the results of this exercise . as expected , the rms deviation of the linear best - fit of the data , which is now much shallower than in the case in which we kept all the available measurements , is quite better , as shown in table 4 .",
    "one could conclude that excluding the asteroids having albedo lower than @xmath67 is the best way to proceed to obtain an improved , and quite better , calibration of the slope - albedo law .",
    "figure [ fig : diffalbbrightrel ] shows that in this way , the relative error on the derived albedo values turns out to be generally better than @xmath68% , a quite good result .

    "unfortunately , there is a range of values of polarization slope which is shared by objects having albedo either around @xmath69 or around @xmath70 . by using a slope - albedo relation which is not valid for low - albedo asteroids may produce a systematic overestimate of the albedo for dark objects",
    ".    the best procedure to be adopted in practice may be the following : when the polarimetric slope of an object is measured with good accuracy , it will be better to use the calibration coefficients obtained by dropping low - albedo objects , displayed in table 1 and fig.@xmath15[fig : slopealbbrightloglogfit ] , _ but only when the polarimetric slope turns out to be smaller than about @xmath71%/deg_. in this way , the relative error in the determination of the albedo should be within @xmath68% , a nice result , as shown in fig.@xmath15[fig : diffalbbrightrel ]",
    ".    if the slope is larger than the above value , and/or when the value of polarization slope is more uncertain , the best choice would be probably to use the calibration coefficients fitting the whole population , displayed in table 1 and fig.@xmath15[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] .",
    "the errors that one should expect for the higher values of polarimetric slopes should be in any case limited , of the order of about @xmath72 , not negligible in relative terms , but in any case sufficient to correctly classify the objects as low - albedo asteroids .",
    "the polarimetric slope data shown in fig.@xmath15[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] , can also suggest that a linear fit is not fully adequate to represent the whole dataset , and a parabolic fit could be more suited to better represent the data .",
    "this is shown in fig.@xmath15[fig : karri ] , in which a parabolic relation @xmath73 is adopted , and the result of a best - fit procedure is shown .",
    "the linear plots already shown in fig.@xmath15[fig : slopealbloglogfit ] and fig.@xmath15[fig : slopealbbrightloglogfit ] are also shown for a visual comparison .",
    "it is clear from the figure that a parabolic fit applied to the whole dataset gives good results .",
    "the slightly worse fit of some objects having albedo around @xmath46 ( located below the parabolic fit ) seems to be compensated by a much better fit of the polarimetric slope and albedo of the asteroid ( 2 ) pallas , which is the most discrepant object when trying linear fits to represent the data .",
    "however , there is still the problem of the ambiguity affecting the values of albedo to be assigned to objects having polarimetric slopes between @xmath46%/deg and @xmath66%/deg , which can not be solved .",
    "for this reason , we list the obtained values of the @xmath74 , @xmath58 , @xmath75 coefficients of our parabolic fit in table 1 , but we are not claiming that there is such a big improvement with respect to the classical linear fit , specially when dropping the lowest - albedo objects , to force us to necessarily use a parabolic fit in the future .",
    "things could change in the case that the discovery of other objects sharing the location of ( 2 ) pallas in the @xmath32 - @xmath2 plane would confirm that a linear fit is not really suited to adequately represent them , even by excluding from the analysis low - albedo objects .",
    "another possibility is that future theoretical advances in the interpretation of light scattering phenomena could suggest that a parabolic fit is intrinsically more correct to fit the relation between polarimetric slope and geometric albedo , based on some physical arguments .",
    "one can wonder whether the slope - albedo relation is really the best available choice to derive good estimates of asteroid albedos .",
    "in fact , asteroid phase - polarization curves do not include only the ( mostly ) linear variation of @xmath19  around the inversion angle .",
    "a negative polarization branch also exists , not to mention the behavior exhibited at large phase angles ( not achievable for main belt objects ) by near - earth asteroids .",
    "historically , another relation between albedo and polarization properties was found to involve the @xmath31 parameter , as shown in eq.@xmath15([eqn : pminpv ] ) . as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "this has been generally abandoned in recent years , because @xmath31 data have been found by some authors to be quite scattered around the best - fit representation given by eq.@xmath50[eqn : pminpv ] . on the other hand",
    ", one could also wonder whether this might be at least partly a consequence of the difficulty of deriving accurate values of @xmath31 from the observations , making use of visual extrapolations of rather sparse polarimetric data .",

    "some examples of practical applications of the above relation are the best - fit curves of the phase - polarization curves of the asteroids shown in fig.@xmath15[fig : fig1 ] . according to its mathematical representation , when the parameters @xmath77 are all positive , the exponential - linear relation describes a curve characterized by a negative polarization branch between @xmath28 and an inversion angle @xmath78 .",
    "the trend tends to become essentially linear at large phase angles , where the exponential term tends quickly to zero .",
    "the computation of the best - fit representation of any phase - polarization curve using eq.@xmath50[eqn : abc ] can be done in many ways . in the present paper ,",
    "we use a genetic algorithm , which , starting from a random set of @xmath79 values , explores the space of possible solution parameters and finds the set of @xmath79 values producing the smallest possible residuals . due to the intrinsic properties of a genetic approach",
    ", the algorithm is launched several times , in order to have a correspondingly high number of solutions , in order to ensure that we are not missing the best possible one .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the evaluation of the errors of any polarimetric parameter derived by a best - fit of the phase - polarization curve using eq.@xmath15[eqn : abc ] , is complicated by the fact that the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath58 and @xmath75 that minimise the @xmath80 are correlated .",

    "* ) are not negligible with respect to the diagonal ones , and therefore the calculation of the error on any polarimetric parameter derived from the exponential - linear curve should take into account all the various co - variances .",
    "our method for the @xmath80 minimization is based on a genetic algorithm , which does not produce automatically the error matrix . for the estimate of the error on polarimetric parameters derived by best - fit values of @xmath79 , it is therefore more practical to adopt an alternative method",

    "it is therefore very important to optimize the performances of the polarimetric technique , as an effective tool to estimate the albedo of the objects , with particularly important applications to the physical characterization of newly - discovered , and potentially hazardous near - earth objects .",
    "we stress again that , once a reliable calibration of the relation between albedo and polarimetric parameters is available , the albedo values obtained by polarimetric data are not affected at all by uncertainties due to poor knowledge of the absolute magnitude of the objects , a relevant advantage over other possible techniques .    in this paper",
    "we have carried out an extensive analysis , based on the idea of using for calibration purposes a still limited number of asteroids for which we can be reasonably confident to know the albedo with good accuracy .",
    "we have used this sample to obtain a new calibration of the classical slope - albedo law , with the polarimetric slope being derived from available data using different possible approaches .",
    "we have also analyzed other possible relations , including a new calibration of the classical @xmath31 - albedo relation , the more recently proposed @xmath106 - albedo relation @xcite , and a new relation based on the @xmath123 polarimetric parameter , introduced for the first time in this paper .",
    "the resulting values of the various polarimetric parameters for @xmath134 asteroids considered in our analysis , and the corresponding values of albedo are given in tables 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the extensive analysis presented in this paper produced a variety of interesting results .",
    "for what concerns the `` classical '' slope - albedo and @xmath31 - albedo relations , we confirm that it is difficult to find a calibration which can fit accurately objects of all albedo classes .",
    "the results improve very much when the asteroids having low albedo , below @xmath67 , are not considered in the analysis .",
    "the presence of asteroids having significantly different albedo but nearly identical polarimetric slopes can even suggest that a parabolic fit is more suited to represent the @xmath32 - albedo relation , as shown in section@xmath15[lowpvslope ] ( see fig.@xmath15[fig : karri ] ) .",
    "the calibration of the @xmath32 albedo and @xmath31 - albedo relations that we obtained by excluding low - albedo asteroids from our analysis gives good results , with uncertainties within @xmath135% for medium- and high - albedo objects . for asteroids exhibiting a steep polarimetric slope , or having a polarimetric slope computed on the basis of only a few observations ,",
    "the classical @xmath32 - albedo relation can still be used , using the calibration coefficients found by considering all the available calibration objects , since the expected errors should be still acceptable .",
    "this is encouraging , because whenever there are at least a few measurements obtained at phase angles larger than @xmath47 , it is generally possible to derive a value of the polarimetric slope @xmath32 , and the resulting albedo values turn out to be reasonably accurate in absolute terms , although the relative error can be above @xmath11% for low - albedo objects . as opposite",
    ", the use of @xmath31 should always be discouraged for asteroids having a deep negative polarization branch , as seen in section [ pmin ] .    if one wants to avoid the complication of using different calibrations of the slope - albedo relation for asteroids belonging to different albedo classes , other polarimetric parameters can also be adopted . in particular ,",
    "both @xmath123 and @xmath106 require to have at disposal phase - polarization curves of a sufficiently good quality to be fit by means of an exponential - linear representation ( eq.@xmath50[eqn : abc ] ) .",
    "this can not be done when the number of polarimetric measurements is too small , or the observations are concentrated over a too limited interval of phase angles . while the uncertainty of albedo determinations based on the @xmath106 parameter seems to be reasonable but not really negligible , the most accurate albedo determinations can be obtained when the @xmath123 parameter can be reliably determined from the available data .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath123 is that this parameter seems to be suited to give accurate values of albedo for both bright and dark asteroids .",
    "of course , there are some _ caveats _ to be taken into account .",
    "for instance , there are asteroids , like the so - called barbarians , which exhibit peculiar phase - polarization curves ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the determination of the geometric albedo for barbarian asteroids is a problem , because any derivation of the albedo using relations valid for the rest of the population may be misleading . however , it is also true that more data are needed to better understand the situation .",
    "in fact , the major problem of asteroid polarimetry today is certainly a serious lack of data .",
    "further progress in this field will require the use of dedicated telescopes , to fill the gap with the amount of information already available from other observing techniques .",
    "polarimetry has been so far severely under - appreciated as an essential tool for physical characterization of asteroids and also other classes of small bodies in the solar system .",
    "the present paper summarizes the current state of the art for what concerns the calibration of the relation between polarimetric properties and albedo , and makes some further steps forward , with the introduction of the @xmath123 parameter , which seems to be a new useful tool to obtain reliable values of asteroid albedos .    in a separate paper , to be submitted soon for publication , we exploit the results of the present analysis to derive the albedos of a fairly large number of objects for which we lack a @xcite determination , and we analyze the distributions of other parameters that characterize the phase - polarization curves of main belt asteroids .",
