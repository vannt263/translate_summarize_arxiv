    "pattern formation in ferromagnetic thin films with perpendicular anisotropy and its thermodynamical description have been the subject of intense experimental  @xcite , theoretical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite work in the last 20 years .",
    "magnetic order in ultrathin ferromagnetic films is very complex due to the competition between exchange and dipolar interactions on different length scales , together with a strong influence of shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropies of the sample .",
    "these in turn are very susceptible to the growth conditions of the films  @xcite .    among the different magnetization patterns that have been observed in these systems , striped order ( i.e. , modulated patterns of local perpendicular magnetization with a well defined half - wavelength or stripe width @xmath0 ) at low temperatures is an ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "one intriguing fact is the strong variation displayed by the equilibrium stripe width @xmath0 in many of these systems , when either the temperature or the film thickness is changed@xcite .",
    "the origin of such variation is still controversial , but recent results suggest that a key point to understand it is the role played by the interfaces ( i.e. , the domain walls ) between stripes@xcite . thus , a starting point to study this problem is to compare the energies of striped patterns with different domain wall configurations .",
    "an accurate description of the domain walls requires to take into account not only the perpendicular component of the local magnetization , but also the in ",
    "plane component .",
    "indeed , some experimental results@xcite are consistent with the presence of bloch domain walls , as expected for perpendicularly oriented magnetization domains@xcite .",
    "to compute the energy contribution of domain walls it is important to consider explicitly the out of plane anisotropy , together with the exchange and dipolar interactions , whose competition is the responsible for the appearance of striped patterns .",
    "a minimum model that contains all these ingredients is the 2d dimensionless heisenberg hamiltonian :    @xmath1 - \\eta \\sum_{i } ( s_i^z)^2 \\label{hamiltoniano}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 are classical unit vectors , the exchange and anisotropy constants are normalized relative to the dipolar coupling constant ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 stands for a sum over nearest neighbors pairs of sites in a square lattice , @xmath5 stands for a sum over _ all distinct _ pairs and @xmath6 is the distance between spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    in the large anisotropy limit @xmath9 this model reduces to an ising model with short range ferromagnetic and long range antiferromagnetic interactions , whose ground state is the striped one@xcite . in that limit",
    "the stripe width increases exponentially with the exchange to dipolar coupling ratio@xcite @xmath10 . for low values of the anisotropy ,",
    "the ground state of this model changes to a planar ferromagnetic state@xcite . in a classic work ,",
    "yafet and gyorgy computed the energy of striped domain configurations with bloch domain walls , by considering a sinusoidal ( perpendicular ) magnetization profile at the walls and saturated magnetization inside the stripes@xcite .",
    "they found that above certain threshold value @xmath11 a striped configuration has less energy than a uniformly ( in  plane ) magnetized one . at this point",
    "the system shows a spin reorientation transition ( srt ) . also within this approximation",
    "the stripe width shows an exponential increase with the anisotropy strength , while the domain wall width decreases algebraically for large enough values of @xmath12 , at least for large values of @xmath13 .",
    "this approximation is expected to work well close to the srt , where the effective anisotropy is small@xcite . however , for large values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 not too close to the srt ( i.e. , when the width of both stripes and walls are large ) one can expect a large departure in the wall energy contribution with respect to the true domain wall configuration , which should approach a hyperbolic tangent profile@xcite .",
    "another important point concerns the in ",
    "plane magnetization component inside the stripes . in their work yafet and gyorgy considered striped solutions where the only in ",
    "plane components lay inside the walls , although they pointed out how to extend their calculations to consider non  saturated magnetization inside the stripes@xcite .",
    "based on that calculation , politi@xcite reported that , at least for large enough values of @xmath13 , the magnetization should show an abrupt saturation very close to the srt , suggesting that the in  plane component inside the stripes is not relevant .",
    "however , recently whitehead et al@xcite obtained evidences of a non  saturated ground state at a relatively small value of @xmath13 for a wide range of values of the anisotropy strength @xmath12 .",
    "their numerical results also showed a correlation between the stripe width and the in ",
    "plane component variations and suggest that this ground state configuration stabilizes at finite temperature , giving rise to what they called a  canted \" phase .",
    "hence , it is important to revise the zero temperature phase diagram of this model in the whole @xmath14 space , including canted configurations , in order to determine to what extent they can be relevant to real systems and their possible influence to the stripe width variation phenomenon .",
    "it is worth noting that the perpendicular anisotropy changes ( inversely ) with the film thickness@xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that the changes in the film thickness can act as a change in the effective temperature@xcite .",
    "hence , understanding the variation of the equilibrium stripe width and the associated domain wall structure as the anisotropy changes at zero temperature can be of great help to understand the corresponding properties a finite temperature , a far more complex problem .    in this work",
    "we analyze the complete equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature in the @xmath14 space of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniano ] ) .",
    "following yafet and gyorgy s work , we only consider straight domains , i.e. , domains in which the spin orientation can be modulated along the @xmath15 direction but is constant in the perpendicular direction @xmath16 ( @xmath17 are the coordinates on the plane of the film ) .",
    "we also consider only bloch walls , i.e. , walls in which the magnetization stays inside the @xmath18 plane . in order to clarify notation and units , and to include some extensions , we briefly review yafet & gyorgy s approximation in appendix [ yafet ] . to obtain the phase diagram",
    "we compute the energy of different types of magnetization profiles and compare them with simulation results obtained through a zero temperature monte carlo ( mc ) method specially designed for the present purposes .",
    "the mc method is presented in appendix [ mcmethod ] . in section [ energysection ]",
    "we derive a general expression for the energy of striped magnetization profiles .",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram and associated properties are derived in section [ phasediagram ] .",
    "a discussion and conclusions are presented in section [ discu ] .",
    "let us consider a square lattice with @xmath19 sites , characterized by the integer indexes @xmath17 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "hence , the index @xmath7 in eq.([hamiltoniano ] ) denotes a pair of coordinates @xmath17 . following yg approximation@xcite",
    ", we consider only uniformly magnetized solutions along every vertical line of sites , i.e. @xmath23 , @xmath24 and allow only bloch walls between domains of perpendicular magnetization , i.e. @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
