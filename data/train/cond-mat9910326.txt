    "the dynamics of excited electrons at metal surfaces has been studied intensively over the last few years .",
    "it is of high interest to understand the dynamics of non - equilibrium electrons in different metals on a femtosecond timescale and its influence on chemical reactions at surfaces , for example . from the relaxation of hot electrons in ferromagnets",
    "one may also learn about the decay of transient magnetization and about spin - selective transport and tunneling .",
    "short laser pulses of 1550 fs duration and the pump - probe technique have made possible the study of electronic dynamics on ultrashort timescales comparable to typical electron - electron interaction timescales , which in metals are of the order of 550 fs for excitation energies of about 12 ev .",
    "the aim of 2ppe experiments is to study the relaxation of single excited electrons .",
    "a relaxation time is extracted from the width of the 2ppe signal as a function of the delay time between pump and probe pulses.@xcite in the earlier experiments,@xcite the relaxation time was interpreted as the lifetime of a single excited electron due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "it was compared to the theoretical result from fermi - liquid theory ( flt).@xcite the order of magnitude and the energy dependence of the flt lifetime were in good agreement with the experimental results.@xcite however , it was realized that additional physical effects such as the transport of excited electrons out of the detection region and the secondary - electron cascade come into play.@xcite it was noted that in 2ppe one generally observes the relaxation of a nascent photoexcited electron population and not only the lifetime of a single excited electron . for low excitation energies , electronic lifetimes",
    "are longer than a few tens of fs , and ballistic transport leads to a removal of electrons from the probed region.@xcite this is indistinguishable from a stronger electronic decay . furthermore , under certain conditions the measured relaxation time shows a surprising non - monotonous feature which depends on the photon energy of the exciting laser , which can not be explained by a single - electron lifetime and transport.@xcite it was pointed out that the holes left behind in the excitation can influence the observed relaxation time of hot electrons.@xcite one explanation was that secondary electrons generated by the filling of holes ( auger electrons ) are responsible for the non - monotonous behavior.@xcite however , the contribution of auger electrons to the relaxation time has raised some controversy .",
    "have argued that auger electrons do not make a significant contribution to the observed 2ppe signal and to the relaxation time at high intermediate - state energies @xmath4.@xcite    the 3@xmath5 transition metals have not been as intensely studied as the noble metals .",
    "however , they offer several interesting features which make it worth to study them in detail .",
    "they offer the opportunity to study spin - dependent interactions if the spin of the emitted electrons is measured.@xcite furthermore , the closeness of the @xmath5 bands to the fermi energy makes it possible to study electronic interactions not only for free - electron - like states , but also for the more localized @xmath5-electron states .    on the theoretical side ,",

    "a theoretical model for the 2ppe process is presented which is based on the time evolution of the distribution function .",

    "@xcite we extend this approach to include not only the relaxation of excited electrons , but also the generation of secondary electrons . rather than performing a first - principles calculation of the lifetime of single excited electrons , we lay emphasis on using a model which yields material - specific single - electron lifetimes for transition metals and enables us to calculate the relaxation time of the distribution including effects of secondary electrons and transport .",
    "this allows a direct comparison of calculated relaxation times with experimental results .",

    "the process of two - photon photoemission is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 2ppe_process ] .",
    "the intensity @xmath6 is obtained by multiplying the distribution function in the intermediate state @xmath7 with a factor @xmath8 for transmission into the vacuum @xcite and with the power of the laser pulse @xmath9 and integrating over time @xmath10 and coordinate @xmath11 perpendicular to the surface : @xmath12 energy and spin of the intermediate state are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the photon frequency is given by @xmath15 .",
    "for the transmission factor , we use the spin - averaged values of the attenuation length @xmath16 measured in overlayer experiments for different elements.@xcite the above expression for the photoemission intensity based on the distribution function is suited for the description of the population dynamics .",
    "our aim here is to describe incoherent electronic processes like the decay of excited electrons and the generation of secondary electrons due to electron - electron scattering .",
    "also , the experiments with which we wish to compare our calculations are phase - averaged measurements of the decay of the population of excited electrons .",
    "the expression is further justified by the fact that for bulk states in metals , one expects rapid loss of coherence within a few fs . however , clearly , if one is mainly interested in coherent effects like the decay of the optically induced polarization , the treatment of the dynamics and the photoemission process should be based on both occupation function and polarization.@xcite recent interferometric measurements have shown relatively long decoherence times in cu of @xmath17 for holes at the top of the @xmath5 bands and electrons at about @xmath18 and up to @xmath19 for electrons at about @xmath20.@xcite    as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2ppe_process ] , 2ppe involves three electronic states , in which electron - electron scattering , electronic transport and emission into the vacuum take place and determine the observed photoemission signal . after optical excitation , the holes left behind in the initial state relax and get filled via coulomb scattering by electrons from occupied levels closer to the fermi energy .",
    "energy conservation requires that at the same time other electrons from below the fermi energy are excited to unoccupied levels above the fermi energy ( secondary electrons ) .",
    "the holes are also filled via transport processes by electrons from the bulk .",
    "the optically excited ( primary ) electrons are scattered out of the intermediate state by scattering with electrons in the fermi sea . on the other hand ,",
    "secondary electrons are scattered into the intermediate state , which leads to the refilling of this state .",
    "the intermediate state can be refilled by : i ) an optically excited ( hot ) electron after an electron - electron scattering process ; ii ) a cold electron from below the fermi energy after scattering with a hot electron ; iii ) an auger electron ( an electron excited from below the fermi energy after a hole is filled by a cold electron ) .",
    "the latter process leads to a dependence of the observed lifetime on the rate of filling of holes ( the inverse hole lifetime ) .",
    "the transport of excited electrons into the bulk leads to the removal of electrons from the intermediate state .",
    "thirdly , the final state is above the vacuum energy and describes a free electron which can escape from the solid . only electrons within a mean free path of the surface absorbing a second photon are emitted into the vacuum .",
    "we use now the boltzmann equation taking into account the above processes to describe the time evolution of the electronic distribution function . the electronic states are characterized by energy @xmath13 , spin @xmath14 , band index @xmath21 and coordinate @xmath11 perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the boltzmann equation reads @xmath22 and contains the rates of change of the occupation due to optical excitation , electron - electron scattering and electronic transport .",

    "the dos in the final state is denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "we use energy - independent optical transition matrix elements .",
    "thus , the strength of the optical excitation is proportional to the initial and final dos .",
    "optical excitation takes place within the optical penetration depth of the surface and has the time dependence of the laser field .",
    "we assume weak optical excitations , since the energy deposited in the system is not enough to significantly disturb the temperature or magnetization .",
    "the fraction of excited electrons per atom is about @xmath34 ( see sec .",
    "[ experiment_section ] ) .",
    "the transition rates due to electron - electron scattering are calculated using fermi s golden rule in the random-@xmath35 approximation , since the strong electron - electron interaction in noble and transition metals leads to a fast redistribution of electronic momenta so that the information about the initial optical excitation process in @xmath35 space is quickly lost .",
    "this then justifies the random-@xmath35 approximation for the calculation of electronic dynamics .",
    "we extend the treatment by penn _",

    "the photoexcited electrons have a random distribution of velocities : @xmath58    the transport effect is caused by the gradient in the particle density created by the photoexcitation within the optical penetration depth .",
    "we take into account the fact that @xmath59 and @xmath5 electrons have different velocities due to their different degree of localization .",
    "the velocity of an electron in band @xmath30 with wave vector @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 thus , nearly free electrons in @xmath59-like bands have higher velocities ( or smaller effective mass ) than more localized electrons in flat , @xmath5-like bands . for @xmath62 electrons",

    "( [ eom ] ) because the time scale for energy transfer between electrons and phonons is on the order of ps and thus longer than the time scales considered in this work.@xcite however , electron - phonon scattering provides an additional mechanism for momentum transfer and can thus reduce the efficiency of ballistic transport.@xcite in our calculation , the neglect of electron - phonon scattering might lead to an overestimate of the transport effect .",
    "the inclusion of the momentum redistribution by electron - phonon scattering is beyond the scope of the present work , but will be the subject of a future publication.@xcite    in eqs .",

    "the two processes occur simultaneously because of energy conservation .",
    "the rate @xmath66 for scattering into a level contains the effects leading to the refilling of the intermediate state . by calculating the scattering rates in a consistent manner for states above and below the fermi energy , we keep track of the creation and relaxation of electrons as well as holes .    note , from the boltzmann equation",
    "we recover the fermi - liquid behavior @xmath67 for the single - electron lifetime .",
    "to see this we write @xmath68 which yields @xmath69 for the inverse lifetime . for simplicity",
    "now we take @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "then the inverse lifetime reduces to @xmath72 where @xmath45 .",
    "one sees the influence of the dos within the distance @xmath73 of the fermi energy and of the coulomb matrix element . for energies very close to @xmath57 or for constant dos @xmath74 one",

    "in addition to the factor @xmath74 from the relaxation of the initial electron at energy @xmath13 , one also has to take into account the available phase space for the electron - hole pair created because of energy conservation , which yields a factor of @xmath77 .",
