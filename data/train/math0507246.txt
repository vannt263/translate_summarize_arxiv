    "the sum of partial augmentations of the classes of elements of order four is different from @xmath88 .",
    "looking at the reduction @xmath89 we see that the induced surjective ring homomorphism @xmath90= \\mathbb z s_4 $ ] maps the conjugacy classes of order @xmath91 of @xmath92 onto the unique conjugacy class @xmath37 of elements of order  4 of @xmath93 .",
    "thus the image of @xmath5 is a unit which has at the conjugacy class @xmath37 a partial augmentation different from zero .",
    "but for @xmath94 the conjecture zc1 holds @xcite .    in the remaining two cases the involution @xmath5 has one of the following sets of partial augmentations different from @xmath88 : @xmath95",

    "note that the unit @xmath119 may be not normalized .",
    "it follows that @xmath120 if and only if @xmath121 and @xmath122 if and only if @xmath123 and @xmath124 or @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "thus there is only one partial augmentation of @xmath5 which is different from zero . by theorem c",
    "we conclude that @xmath5 is conjugate to an element of @xmath127 .",
    "we remark that it seems to be unknown whether the conjecture zc1 is valid for a direct product @xmath128 if it holds for @xmath4 and @xmath129 .",
    "zc1 is valid for all finite 3-dimensional crystallographic point groups .    by the classification of 3-dimensional crystallographic point groups the maximal ones are @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 denotes the dihedral group of order @xmath134 .",
    "zc1 is known for @xmath135 and all its subgroups by @xcite , for the @xmath51-group @xmath136 and all its subgroups by @xcite .",

    "let @xmath8 be a subgroup of the finite group @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that zc1 holds for @xmath46",
    ". then we may consider @xmath142 as subring of @xmath39 via the inclusion of @xmath8 in @xmath46 . because zc1 holds ,",
    "a torsion unit @xmath5 of @xmath143 is conjugate within @xmath10 to @xmath144 . if @xmath37 is a conjugacy class of @xmath4 with @xmath145 then the partial augmentation @xmath146 .",
    "therefore @xmath5 is conjugate to @xmath147 within @xmath10 .",
