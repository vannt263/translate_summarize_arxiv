    "recently jefferson lab(jlab )  @xcite using a high intensity electron beam of energy 5.767 gev has measured the nuclear dependence of the structure function in some nuclei by studying the ratio r(@xmath3)=@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the inclusive cross section in nuclei and @xmath6 is the inclusive cross section in deuterium . the experimental results for the ratio r(@xmath3 ) have been presented by them  @xcite for 0.3 @xmath7 0.9 and have re - confirmed the older emc results  @xcite that the structure function of a nucleon is modified when it is placed inside a nucleus .",

    "@xcite . there ,",
    "several tests concerning the fulfillment of sum rules , and the preservation of the analytical properties of the meson propagator and the consistency of the results with similar calculations were considered .",

    "the sum rule should be valid for a nuclear model where the hamiltonian would contain only pions and nucleons .",

    "nonetheless , it can provide further constraints on the size of the mesonic contribution and it will be discussed in the results section .    the mesonic cloud contribution is expected to be negligible for deuteron as it depends , roughly speaking , quadratically on the baryon density which is quite small for this case range .",
    "thus , its inclusion would have a very minor effect in the ratios .",

    "therefore , the difference between the base curve and the full one comes basically from the @xmath52 and @xmath53 contributions that play an important role .",

    "the slope and size of the nuclear effects are similar to the beryllium case .",
    "this could look surprising given the quite different average density as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this points out to the fact that `` average density '' could not be the appropriate parameter for the description of the emc effect in light nuclei . for example , this has been discussed in sect .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "again , a determining factor in the agreement is the mesonic cloud contribution . given this , some words of caution are needed here .",
    "first , the parton distribution functions are poorly known for the mesons and possible off - shell effects have not been included in the calculation .",
    "second , the results depend on the meson selfenergies in the medium that also contain some uncertainties such as the specific form of the spin - isospin interaction , specially for the @xmath53 meson .",
    "a full analysis of these uncertainties is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "to give an idea of their size , we have shown in this figure the results for the ratio using the full model with @xmath62 , @xmath76=1gev and @xmath62 , @xmath76=1.2gev and 0.8gev .",
    "we find that a 20@xmath115 variation in the @xmath62 s , results in a 2 - 3@xmath115 change in the ratio .",

    "the mesons carry a light - cone momentum fraction of 3 percent for @xmath116 gev .",
    "the 2 percent prescribed by the sum rule can be obtained for a cut - off @xmath117 gev .",
    "this suggests that lower cut - off values should be preferred but one must be careful before reaching such conclusion .",
    "for instance , the nucleon momentum fraction is very sensitive to parameters like the expected value of the nucleon kinetic energy that are not very well known and has some uncertainty .",
    "we have used the values obtained with our nucleon spectral function .",

    "however , that region is much affected by possible off - shell effects  @xcite , not included in our approach , and by high momentum components of the nucleons wave function .",
    "therefore , we can not make any strong statement about this discrepancy apart from the fact that we are reaching one of the limits of validity of our model .",
    "we have also checked that the use of next to next to leading order pdfs , that considerably lengthens and complicates the calculation , does not appreciably change the results , at the level of precision of the current data and the size of other theoretical uncertainties .",

    "even small changes of the pion nuclear selfenergy can produce appreciable changes in the cross section ratios .",

    "<S> the ratios @xmath1 are obtained and compared with recent jlab results for light nuclei with special attention to the slope of the @xmath2 distributions . this magnitude shows a non trivial a dependence and it is insensitive to possible normalization uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the results have also been compared with some of the older experiments using intermediate mass nuclei .    </S>",
