    "the global analyses of the free nucleon parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are grounded on the asymptotic freedom of qcd , factorization and parton evolution .",

    "the factorization theorem has turned out to work extremely well with increasingly many different types of data included in the latest free proton pdf analyses . for bound nucleons factorization",
    "is not as well - established , but it has anyway proven to do a very good job @xcite in describing the measured nuclear modifications @xmath3 in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) dilepton production involving nuclear targets .",

    "we define the nuclear pdfs through nuclear modification factors @xmath4 as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 refers to a cteq set of the free proton pdfs @xcite in the zero - mass variable flavour number scheme .",

    "the weight factors @xmath23 amplify the importance of those data sets whose content is physically relevant , but whose contribution to @xmath24 would otherwize be too small to be noticed by the automated minimization routine we use .",
    "besides finding the central set of parameters @xmath25 that optimally fits the data , propagating the experimental uncertainties to the pdfs has become an inseparable part of the modern pdf fits .",
    "the hessian method @xcite , which we use , trusts on a quadratic approximation @xmath26 the eigenvectors @xmath27 of the hessian matrix @xmath28 serve as an uncorrelated basis for building the pdf error sets @xmath29 .",
    "these are obtained by displacing the fit parameters to the positive / negative direction along @xmath27 such that @xmath24 grows by a certain amount @xmath30 from the minimum @xmath31 . using these sets , the upper and lower uncertainty of a quantity @xmath32",

    "consequently , also the predictions for pion @xmath41 differ significantly as is easily seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : phenix ] .",
    "this is actually good news as this type of data , especially with better statistics , may eventually discriminate between different proposed gluon modifications .",
    "attention should be also paid to the experimentally observed scaling - violations and that the dglap dynamics is able to reproduce them well .",
