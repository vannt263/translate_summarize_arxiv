    "in the bcs to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover @xcite , largely overlapping cooper pairs smoothly evolve into non - overlapping composite bosons as the fermionic attraction is progressively increased .",
    "these two physical situations ( cooper pairs vs composite bosons ) correspond to the weak- and strong - coupling limits of the theory , while in the interesting intermediate - coupling regime neither the fermionic nor the bosonic properties are fully realized . under these circumstances ,",
    "the theory is fully controlled on the weak- and strong - coupling sides , while at intermediate coupling an interpolation scheme results ( as for all crossover approaches ) .",
    "these physical ideas are implemented , in practice , by allowing for a strong decrease of the chemical potential _ at a given temperature _ when passing from the weak- to the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover can be considered both below ( broken - symmetry phase ) and above ( normal phase ) the superconducting critical temperature . in particular , in the normal phase preformed pairs exist in the strong - coupling limit up to a temperature @xmath0 corresponding to the breaking of the pairs , while coherence among the pairs is established when the temperature is lowered below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 . this framework could be relevant to the evolution of the properties of high - temperature cuprate superconductors from the overdoped ( weak - coupling ) to the underdoped ( strong - coupling ) regions of their phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover can be also explicitly realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in a trap , by varying their mutual effective attractive interaction via a fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover has been studied extensively in the past , either at @xmath2 or for @xmath3 . at @xmath2 , the solution of the two coupled bcs ( mean - field ) equations for the order parameter @xmath4 and the chemical potential @xmath5 has been shown to cross over smoothly from a bcs weak - coupling superconductor with largely overlapping cooper pairs to a strong - coupling superconductor where tightly - bound pairs are condensed in a bose - einstein ( coherent ) ground state  @xcite . for this reason , the bcs mean field",
    "has often been considered to be a reliable approximation for studying the whole bcs - bec crossover at @xmath2 . at finite temperature , the increasing importance in strong coupling of the thermal excitation of collective modes ( corresponding to noncondensed bosons ) was first pointed out by nozires and schmitt - rink  @xcite . by their approach ,",
    "the expected result that the superconducting critical temperature should approach the bose - einstein temperature @xmath6 in strong coupling was obtained ( coming from _ above @xmath1 _ ) via a ( first - order ) inclusion of the @xmath7-matrix self - energy in the fermionic single - particle green s function .",
    "the same type of @xmath7-matrix approximation ( also with the inclusion , by some authors , of self - consistency ) has then been widely adopted to study the bcs - bec crossover above @xmath1 , both for continuum  @xcite and lattice models  @xcite .    despite its conceptual importance , a systematic study of the bcs - bec crossover in the temperature range @xmath8 is still lacking . a diagrammatic theory for the bcs - bec crossover that extends below @xmath1 the self - consistent @xmath7-matrix approximation",
    "was proposed some time ago by haussmann  @xcite .",
    "the ensuing coupled equations for the order parameter and chemical potential were , however , solved explicitly only at @xmath1 ,  @xcite leaving therefore unsolved the problem of the study of the whole temperature region below @xmath1 .",
    "the work by levin and coworkers  @xcite , on the other hand , even though based on a `` preformed - pair scenario '' , has focused mainly on the weak - to - intermediate coupling region , where the fermionic chemical potential remains inside the single - particle band .",
    "an extension of the self - consistent @xmath7-matrix approximation to the superconducting phase for a two - dimensional lattice model was considered in ref .  .",
    "in that paper , however , the shift of the chemical potential associated with the increasing coupling strength was ignored , by keeping it fixed at the noninteracting value.@xcite the results of ref .   are thus not appropriate to address the bcs - bec crossover , for which the renormalization of the chemical potential ( that evolves from the fermi energy in weak coupling to half the binding energy of a pair in strong coupling ) plays a crucial role  @xcite .",
    "additional studies have made use of a fermion - boson model  @xcite , especially in the context of trapped fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "purpose of the present paper is to study the bcs - bec crossover in the superconducting phase over the whole temperature range from @xmath2 to @xmath9 , thus filling a noticeable gap in the literature .",
    "we will consider a three - dimensional continuum model , for which the fermionic attraction can be modeled by a point - contact interaction .",
    "as noted in refs .   and  , with this model the structure of the diagrammatic theory for the single - particle fermionic self - energy simplifies considerably , since only limited sets of diagrammatic structures survive the regularization of the contact potential in terms of the fermionic two - body scattering length @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath11 ( where the fermi wave vector @xmath12 is related to the density via @xmath13 ) then ranges from @xmath14 in weak coupling to @xmath15 in strong coupling .",
    "the crossover region of interest is , however , restricted in practice by @xmath16 .",
    "for this model , a systematic theoretical study of the evolution of the single - particle spectral function in the normal phase from the bcs to bec limits has been presented recently  @xcite .",
    "like in ref .  , also in ref .   the coupling of a fermionic single - particle excitation to a ( bosonic ) superconducting fluctuation mode was taken into account by the @xmath7-matrix self - energy .",
    "this approximation embodies the physics of a dilute fermi gas in the weak - coupling limit and reduces to a description of independent composite bosons in the strong - coupling limit . in this way",
    ", single - particle spectra were obtained in ref .   as functions of coupling strength and temperature .    in the present paper ,",
    "the @xmath7-matrix approximation for the self - energy is suitably extended below @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the _ same _ superconducting fluctuations , that in refs .   and were coupled to fermionic independent - particle excitations above @xmath17 , are now coupled to fermionic bcs - like single - particle excitations below @xmath17 . in the strong - coupling limit , it turns out that these superconducting fluctuations merge in a nontrivial way@xcite into a state of condensed composite bosons described by the bogoliubov theory , and evolve consistently into a state of independent composite bosons above @xmath17 ( as the bogoliubov theory for point - like bosons does @xcite ) . in this way , a direct connection is established between the structures of the single - particle fermionic self - energy above _ and _ below @xmath17 , as they embody the same kind of bosonic mode which itself evolves with temperature .",
    "a comment on the validity of the bogoliubov theory at finite temperature ( and , in particular , close to the bose - einstein transition temperature @xmath18 ) might be relevant at this point .",
    "a consistent theory for a _ dilute _ condensed bose gas was developed long ago in terms of a ( small ) gas parameter @xcite , of which the bogoliubov theory @xcite is only an approximate form valid at low enough temperatures ( compared with @xmath18 ) .",
    "that theory correctly describes also the dilute bose gas in the normal phase @xcite , whereas the bogoliubov theory ( when extrapolated above the critical temperature ) recovers the independent - boson form ( albeit in a non - monotonic way , with a discontinuous jump affecting the bosonic condensate @xcite )",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to identify ( at least in principle ) a fermionic theory that , in the strong - coupling limit of the fermionic attraction , maps onto a more sophisticated bosonic theory , overcoming the apparent limitations of the bogoliubov theory . in practice , however , it should be considered already a nontrivial achievement of the present approach the fact that the bosonic bogoliubov approximation can be reproduced from an originally fermionic theory . for these reasons , and also because it is actually the intermediate - coupling ( crossover ) region to be of most physical interest , in the following we shall consider the bogoliubov approximation as a reasonable limiting form of our fermionic theory .    as it is always the case for the bcs - bec crossover approach , implementation of the theory developed in the present paper rests on solving two coupled equations for the order parameter @xmath4 and the chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "the equations here considered for @xmath4 and @xmath5 generalize the usual equations already considered at the mean - field level  @xcite , by including fluctuation corrections .",
    "our equations reproduce the expected physics in the strong - coupling limit , at least at the level of approximation here considered .",
    "their solution provides us with the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 as functions of coupling strength @xmath11 and temperature @xmath19 , thus extending results obtained previously at the mean - field level .",
    "in particular , the order parameter is now found to vanish at a temperature ( close to ) @xmath17 even in the strong - coupling limit , while it would had vanished close to @xmath20 at the mean - field level @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation of the fermionic self - energy to the real frequency axis is further performed to obtain the single - particle spectral function @xmath21 , that we study in a systematic way as a function of wave vector @xmath22 , frequency @xmath23 , coupling strength @xmath11 , and temperature @xmath19 . in this context , two novel sum rules ( specific to the broken - symmetry phase ) are obtained , which provide compelling checks on the numerical calculations .",
    "in addition , the numerical calculations are tested against analytic ( or semi - analytic ) approximations obtained in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the study of a dynamical quantity like @xmath24 enables us to attempt a comparison with the experimental arpes and tunneling spectra for cuprate superconductors below @xmath1 , for which a large amount of data exists showing peculiar features for different doping levels and temperatures .",
    "as in ref .   above @xmath1",
    ", this comparison concerns especially the experimental data about the m points in the brillouin zone of cuprates , where pairing effects are supposed to be stronger than along the nodal lines .",
    "our main results are the following . about thermodynamic quantities",
    ", we will show that fluctuation corrections over and above mean field are especially important at finite temperature @xmath25 when approaching the strong - coupling limit . at zero temperature ,",
    "fluctuation corrections to thermodynamic quantities turn out to be of some relevance only in the intermediate - coupling region .",
    "this supports the expectation  @xcite that the bcs mean field at zero temperature should describe rather well the bcs - bec crossover essentially for all couplings .",
    "regarding instead dynamical quantities like @xmath24 , our calculation based on a `` preformed - pair scenario '' reveals two distinct spectral features for @xmath26 .",
    "these features , which have different temperature and doping dependences , together give rise to a peak - dip - hump structure which is actively debated for the arpes spectra of cuprate superconductors .",
    "our results differ from those previously obtained by other calculations  @xcite also based on a `` preformed - pair scenario '' , where a single feature was instead obtained in the spectral function for @xmath26 .",
    "an explanation of this discrepancy between the two calculations will be provided .",
    "it will also turn out from our calculation that the coherent part of @xmath24 for @xmath26 follows essentially a bcs - like behavior as far as its wave - vector dependence is concerned , albeit with a gap value which contains an important contribution from fluctuations at finite temperature .",
    "the same bcs - like behavior is not found , however , by our calculation for the dependence of the spectral weight of the coherent peak on temperature and coupling .",
    "this evidences a dichotomy in the behavior of @xmath24 , according to which of its dependences one is after .",
    "such a dichotomy is clearly observed in experiments on cuprate superconductors , in good qualitative agreement with the results obtained by our calculations .",
    ". a detailed quantitative comparison of our results with the experimental data on cuprates would , however , require a more refined theoretical model , as to include the quasi - two - dimensional lattice structure , the @xmath27-wave character of the superconducting gap , and also a fermionic attraction that depends effectively on doping ( and possibly on temperature )",
    ". future work on this subject should address these additional issues .",
    "the present theory could be improved in several ways . in the present approach",
    ", the effective interaction between the composite bosons is treated within the born approximation . for a dilute system of composite bosons",
    "one knows how to improve on this result , as shown in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) .",
    "in addition , the bogoliubov description for the composite bosons could be also improved , for instance , by extending to the composite bosons the popov treatment for point - like bosons  @xcite . finally ,",
    "on the weak - coupling side of the crossover the bcs theory could be modified by including the contributions shown by gorkov and melik - barkhudarov  @xcite to yield a finite renormalization of the critical temperature and of the gap function _ even _ in the extreme weak - coupling limit .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss our choice for the fermionic self - energy in the superconducting phase , from which the order parameter @xmath4 and the chemical potential @xmath5 are obtained as functions of temperature and coupling strength , and the spectral function @xmath21 also results .",
    "analytic results are presented in the strong - coupling limit , where the order parameter is shown to be connected with the bosonic condensate density of the bogoliubov theory .",

    "section iv gives our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a two sum rules are derived for the superconducting phase , which are used as checks of the numerical results .",
    "in this section , we discuss the choice of the fermionic single - particle self - energy in the superconducting phase for a ( three - dimensional ) continuum system of fermions mutually interacting via an attractive point - contact potential , with an @xmath28-wave order parameter .",
    "we shall place special emphasis to the strong - coupling limit of the theory , where composite bosons forms as bound fermion pairs .",
    "we extend in this way _ below _",
    "@xmath17 an analogous treatment for the self - energy , made previously in the normal phase to calculate the single - particle spectral function.@xcite    knowledge of the detailed form of the attractive interaction is not generally required when studying the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "accordingly , one may consider the simple form @xmath29 of a `` contact '' potential , where @xmath30 is a negative constant .",
    "this choice entails a suitable regularization in terms , e.g. , of a cutoff @xmath31 in wave - vector space . in three dimensions ,",
