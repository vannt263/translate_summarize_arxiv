    "in recent years in addition to the well known tev scale colliders such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 machines the possibilities of the realization of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 colliders have been proposed and discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "here one of the main motivations is to reach the tev scale at a subprocess level .",
    "the collisions of protons from a large hadron machine with electrons from a linac is the most efficient way of achieving tev scale at a constituent level in @xmath5 collisions @xcite .",
    "a further interesting feature is the possibility of constructing @xmath4 colliders on the base of linac - ring @xmath5-machines .",
    "this can be realized by using the beam of high energy photons produced by the compton backscattering of laser photons off a beam of linac electrons .",
    "actually this method was originally proposed to construct @xmath2 and @xmath3 colliders on the bases of @xmath1 linacs [ ginzburg et.al ref.1 ] . for the physics program at @xmath2 and @xmath3 machines",
    "see refs.@xcite .",
    "recently different physics phenomena which can be investigated at @xmath4 colliders have been considered in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "it seems that these machines may open new possibilities for the investigations of the standard model and beyond it . for a review see ref.@xcite .    on the other hand , among the various extensions beyond the sm the supersymmetry idea seems to be a well - motivated strong candidate to investigate the new physics around tev scale @xcite . in susy",
    "inspired models the usual particle spectrum is doubled at least ; every particle has a superpartner differing in spin by a half unit .",
    "also two higss doublets are needed to give mass to both up and down quarks and make the theory anomaly free .",
    "it is highly believed that superpartners of the known particles should have masses below 1 tev in order not to loose the good features of the susy .",
    "the direct experimental evidence for the sparticles is still lacking and the results of the experiments in the existing colliders indicate that squarks have masses @xmath6 ; consequently higher energy scale should be probed and it is desirable to reach the tev scale at a constituent level @xcite . therefore it might be sensible to say that hera , lep , fermilab and lhc should be sufficient to check the idea of low energy susy , namely the scale between 100 gev and 1 tev , however experiments at all possible types of colliding beams would be inevitable to explore the new physics at the tev scale .    in this report we will study the productions of susy particles in polarized tev scale photon - proton collisions .",
    "several susy production processes such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 have already been discussed @xcite without taking into account the initial beam polarizations .",
    "polarization effects have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "also scalar leptoquark productions at tev energy @xmath4 colliders have been investigated @xcite .",
    "let us first briefly review the polarization properties of high energy photon beams .",
    "a beam of laser photons ( @xmath13 ev , for example ) with high intensity , about @xmath14 photons per pulse , is compton - backscattered off high energy electrons ( @xmath15=250 gev , for example ) from a linear accelerator and turns into hard photons with a conversion coefficient close to unity .",
    "the energy of the backscattered photons , @xmath16 , is restricted by the kinematic condition @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) in order to get rid of background effects , in particular @xmath19 pair production in the collision of a laser photon with a backscattered photon in the conversion region .",
    "the details of the compton kinematics and calculations of the cross section can be found in ref.@xcite ( see ginzburg et.al ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of the high energy real ( backscattered ) photons , @xmath20 , is given by    @xmath21\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the laser photon and the electron helicities respectively , and @xmath26 is    @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in our numerical calculations , we assume @xmath28 @xmath29 or equivalently @xmath30 which corresponds to the optimum value of @xmath31 , as mentioned above .    the energy spectrum , @xmath32 , does essentially depend on the value @xmath33 . in the case of opposite helicities ( @xmath34 )",
    "the spectrum has a very sharp peak at the high energy part of the photons .",
    "this allows us to get a highly monochromatic high energy gamma beam by eliminating low energy part of the spectrum @xcite ( see ginzburg et.al and borden et.al ) . on the contrary , for the same helicities ( @xmath35 ) the spectrum is flat .",
    "the average degree of linear polarization of the photon is proportional to the degree of linear polarization of the laser . in our calculations , we assume that the degree of linear polarization of the laser is zero so that the final photons have only the degree of circular polarization @xmath36 and @xmath37@xmath38 @xmath39 . the circular polarization of the backscattered photon is given as follows    @xmath40    for the same initial polarizations ( @xmath41 ) , it is seen that @xmath42 , as nearly independent of @xmath43 ; while for the case of the opposite polarizations ( @xmath44 ) , the curve @xmath45 smoothly changes from @xmath46 to @xmath47 as @xmath43 increases from zero to @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we consider the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) which includes soft breaking terms . here",
    "we have only taken into account the direct interaction of the photons with partons in the proton .",
    "the resolved contributions to the susy particle productions are relatively small , around 10% which do not affect our estimates for the discovery mass limits of new particles very much @xcite .    the invariant amplitude for the subprocess @xmath49 proceeds via the t- , u - channel squark exchange and four - point vertex interactions .",
    "the polarized differential cross - section of this subprocess can be calculated in terms of the usual mandelstam variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 as :    @xmath52    @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath54\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath55 is the squark charge , @xmath56 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the fine structure constant and @xmath59 are the circular polarization parameters of the photon and gluon respectively . after performing the integration over @xmath60 one can easily obtain the total cross section for the subprocess @xmath49 as follows :    @xmath61\\\\ \\hat{\\sigma}_{pol}&=&\\frac{\\pi\\alpha e^2_{\\tilde{q } } \\alpha_s}{2\\hat{s}}\\biggr[2\\beta-2(1-\\beta^2 ) ln\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 .",
    "the above expression in ( 4 ) is a cross section for left- squarks or right - squarks only , and a color factor of @xmath63 is already included . in order to obtain the total cross section for the process @xmath12 one should integrate @xmath64 over the gluon and photon distributions . for this purpose",
    "we make the following change of variables : first expressing @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and furthermore calling @xmath71 , @xmath72 then one obtains @xmath73 .",
    "the limiting values are @xmath74 in order to get rid of the background effects in the compton backscattering , particularly @xmath1 pair production in the collision of the laser with the high energy photon in the conversion region , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78",
    ". then we can write the total cross section with right circular polarized laser and spin - up proton beam polarized longitudinally as follows :    @xmath79\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( 1-p)\\biggr[f^{\\gamma}_{+}(\\frac{\\tau}{x})f^g_{+/\\downarrow}(x ) \\hat{\\sigma } ( \\tau s , m_{\\tilde{q}},1,1 ) + f^{\\gamma}_{+}(\\frac{\\tau}{x } ) f^g_{-/\\downarrow}(x)\\hat{\\sigma}(\\tau s , m_{\\tilde{q } } , 1,-1)\\biggr]\\biggr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath80 inside @xmath64 refers to the values of the stokes parameters @xmath81 respectively .",
    "using the eq.(4 ) the above expression yields @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\ + ( 1-p)\\biggr[f^{\\gamma}_{+}(\\frac{\\tau}{x})f^g_{unpol}(x ) \\hat{\\sigma}_{np } + f^{\\gamma}_{+}(\\frac{\\tau}{x})(+\\delta{f}^g_{pol}(x ) ) \\hat{\\sigma}_{pol}\\biggr]\\biggr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where p is the polarization percentage of spin - up protons in the beam and for a maximum attainable degree of 70% longitudinal polarization @xmath83 .",
    "also @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the polarized distributions for the photon and gluon inside the proton , respectively . in the numerical calculations we used the unpolarized and difference distributions ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 taken from @xcite :    @xmath88\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath89 the energy spectrum of the high energy real photons @xmath90 is given as in eq.(1 - 2 ) . to carry out the numerical integration we take @xmath91",
    "hence consider only u - type squarks and @xmath92 is taken .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations clearly indicate that the process @xmath93 has a detectable cross section . in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a - c ) the dependence on the squark masses is shown for different @xmath4 colliders .",
    "the relevant parameters of these machines are given in table 1 .",
    "on the other hand observation limit for the new particles is taken to be 100 events per running year ( @xmath94 seconds ) .",
    "this level of observability is considered to be satisfactory since the background is expected to be clearer than that encountered in the hadron colliders where 1000 events / year is usually desired due to the strong background processes . hence taking into account the luminosity values given in table  [ tab1 ]",
    "[ see aydin et al . in ref.1",
    "] , one can easily find from the figs .",
    "[ fig1](a - c ) the upper mass limits for the squarks .",
    "these values of discovery limits are also tabulated in table  [ tab1 ] . for the d - type squarks @xmath95 putting @xmath96 , results in the decrease of the cross section by a factor 1/4 , but the corresponding upper mass values are approximately some seventy percent of those in the last column of the table  [ tab1 ] . furthermore the mixings among left and right squarks might be taken into consideration . because their masses are expected to be close to each other , one can assume that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are degenerate in mass which points out that for the @xmath99 production one can always consider the sum of the two cross section for @xmath97 and @xmath98 production .",
    "hence if we do this incoherent sum of @xmath97 and @xmath98 and with @xmath100 we must multiply the expression in ( 4 ) by an extra factor two , which increases the discovery limits for the squark masses .",
    "one additional assumption can be made by assuming five degenerate flavours of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , ( namely except stop ) which multiplies the individual squark pair production cross section , eq.(3 ) by about a factor of six and a half .",
    "we see that the cross sections for different initial beam polarizations do not differ much which reflects the scalar nature of the squarks .",
    "on the other hand the use of the polarized beams make it possible to look for the polarization asymmetries as a function of the squark masses . in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a - c ) we have presented the results of the polarization asymmetry using the results of the up and down polarized proton beams .",
    "asymmetry has been defined through the following relation    @xmath101    as can be seen from the figures 2(a - c ) the asymmetry is sensitive to the squark mass which can be useful for determination of the mass parameter .",
    "furthermore another asymmetry might be defined considering the opposite polarizations of the laser beam .",
    "hence left - right asymmetry defined with respect to the laser beam as    @xmath102    the results of the calculations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and a similar behaviour is seen .",
    "+ * _ signature for the pair production of squarks : _ * one characteristic feature of the r - parity conserving supersymmetric processes is the large missing energy .",
    "usually photino mass is assumed to be less than @xmath103 .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath104 .",
    "the decay of the squark into photino is not the only possibility . for squark masses larger than 200 - 300 gev and depending on the mass spectrum of",
    "the other susy particles there exist additional decay modes such as @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107,@xmath108 . branching ratios of these decays depend on the masses of these particles and coupling constants .",
    "one possibility of the decay of zino is the decay into a neutrino and a sneutrino . both particles will not be observed like photinos",
    ". therefore the signature for the process @xmath109 will be in general multijets + lepton(s ) + large missing energy and missing @xmath110 .",
    "the definite polarization asymmetries associated with the missing energy and momentum may help in separating these events from the backgrounds .",
    "actually the production of the squark pairs in @xmath111 collisions via the quasi - real photon gluon fusion were studied before @xcite . however in these studies weizsacker - williams approximation has been used for the quasi - real photon distribution @xmath112 . since",
    "the ww - spectrum is much softer than the real @xmath113 spectrum the discovery mass limits for the squarks in our case turn out to be much higher than the conventional ep - colliders .",
    "finally our analysis shows that the future @xmath4 colliders can have considerable capacities in addition to the well known @xmath114 and @xmath1 colliders in the investigation of supersymmetric particles .",
    "we see that the range of squark masses that can be explored at various @xmath4-machines ( 200 gev - 0.85 tev ) are higher than the corresponding values at standard type @xmath5-colliders ( 20 gev - 80 gev for hera ) .",
    "several lhc studies have shown that the reach for squarks will be greater than 1 tev .",
    "but clearer backgrouds in a gamma - proton collider can be considered to be an advantageous feature in extracting supersymmetric signals .",
