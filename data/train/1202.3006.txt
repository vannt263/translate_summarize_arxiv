    "the key observation being that one can mimic enough of the character theory used in  @xcite with just two distinct elements @xmath19 having @xmath20 , the bottom element , for @xmath21 .",

    "further , when considering the matrix of an operator @xmath40 , it is understood that the _ standard basis _ consisting of the elements of @xmath4 is to be considered , and ordered so that @xmath38 indexes the first row and column of the matrix .",
    "lastly , we remark that the notation is motivated by young s lattice , viewed as the bratteli diagram associated to the tower @xmath41 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspond to the two linear representations of @xmath42 for @xmath21 .     for a @xmath27-differential poset ( left ) and a @xmath43-differential poset ( right ) . ]    for nonnegative integers @xmath44 , define @xmath45 with @xmath46 .
