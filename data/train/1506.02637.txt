    "type ia supernovae ( sneia ) have been a key component in measuring the dark energy equation of state , @xmath5 , with @xmath76% uncertainty @xcite and the hubble constant , h@xmath2 , with 3.3% uncertainty ( @xcite ; hereafter r11 ) .",
    "with such small error budgets , unknown systematic uncertainties affecting sneia shape- and color - corrected absolute magnitudes could have serious consequences for our understanding of dark energy , neutrino properties , and the global geometry of space .",
    "although sneia remain accurate distance indicators with @xmath010% uncertainty per sn , there are concerns about their ability to remain standardizable in galaxies that vary in mass , metallicity , star formation , age , and dust properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even a small dependence of snia luminosities on host galaxy properties may have a non - negligible effect on @xmath5 due to the redshift evolution of galaxies or differences in sample selection .",
    "such an effect could also bias h@xmath2 due to the different demographics of cepheid host galaxies compared to snia hosts .",
    "the lack of detection of such an effect at @xmath83@xmath1 with samples of @xmath010@xmath9 sne suggests that such effects are @xmath7 @xmath10 mag , or that they result from galaxy properties that are difficult to measure robustly .",
    "these investigations are hampered by an inability to define the nature of the snia correction _ a priori _ , complicating the interpretation of the significance of the correlations found _ a posteriori_. if enough sources for a possible correlation are examined , a 3@xmath1 result will always be found .",
    "the first widely accepted effect of host galaxy properties on sneia was confirmed by the detection of a @xmath00.07 mag difference in mean corrected magnitude of sneia with host masses @xmath810@xmath11",
    ". identified by several independent studies including @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , this effect has now been detected at @xmath85@xmath1 by @xcite with a sample of 740 sneia .    because it is unclear how the physics of a snia distances could depend on its host galaxy mass , the most likely explanation is that host galaxy mass is merely tracing another physical property that could affect sn luminosity , such as metallicity , stellar age , or dust .",
    "@xcite suggested that progenitor metallicity could affect the sn luminosity by changing the carbon - oxygen ratio in the progenitor white dwarf , thus resulting in a lower nickel mass synthesized in the explosion .",
    "@xcite found that a correction using a star formation - based metallicity indicator reduced hubble diagram residuals more than a simple host mass correction .",
    "@xcite found that dust and stellar age are also plausible explanations because they evolve with host galaxy mass .",
    "different snia progenitor ages could also exhibit systematic differences in corrected magnitude due to the effects of metallicity or explosion mechanism on @xmath12ni production @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that progenitor age could be the source of the host mass step , as older progenitors preferentially occur in non star - forming host galaxies . because progenitor age evolves with redshift",
    ", @xcite modeled a potential redshift - dependent bias in cosmological analyses .",
    "snia light curve fitters may also create biases by assuming a universal relationship between color and absolute magnitude , independent of the dust composition of different snia hosts .",
    "some preliminary evidence has supported these ideas ; @xcite found that the correlation between snia color and absolute magnitude has two different slopes for bluer and redder sne , which may in part be due to dust properties .",
    "if the host mass step is indicative of one or more of these biases , galaxy properties in the vicinity of sn explosions could be more strongly correlated with sn corrected magnitude than properties of the galaxies as a whole .",
    "three recent studies used @xmath060@xmath1385 nearby sneia to look at such properties and found that they affect the distances derived from sneia . @xcite and @xcite found a correlation between local star formation and snia hubble residuals from the nearby supernova factory @xcite and the cfa sn survey ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite ( hereafter r15 ) found a mean difference in hubble residuals between sneia@xmath15 and ia@xmath16 ( hereafter referred to as the lsf step ) of @xmath00.09@xmath130.17 mag at 2 - 4@xmath1 significance with different light curve fitters .",
    "the fraction of sneia@xmath15 is different in the nearby cepheid - calibrated snia sample compared to the hubble - flow snia sample , and r15 found that sneia@xmath15 have mean corrected magnitudes @xmath00.15 mag brighter than sneia@xmath16 when fit with the mlcs light curve fitter and assuming the same r@xmath17 as the r11 h@xmath2 baseline analysis .",
    "they derived a correction to h@xmath2 :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the fraction of sneia@xmath15 in the hubble - flow sn sample and @xmath20 is the fraction of sneia@xmath15 in the cepheid - calibrated sample .",

    "r15 also found that sne in highly star - forming regions fit by mlcs @xcite have lower dispersion in their hubble residuals than sne in locally passive environments .",

    "perhaps a re - trained version of mlcs that incorporates terms such as random sn color scatter @xcite would reduce the mlcs outlier fraction and provide more precise distances .      because our final measurement of the lsf step with r@xmath75 is only a @xmath1 detection , there are no grounds in the bayesian sense to correct h@xmath2 for the lsf step .",
    "however , a useful test of systematic uncertainties in the future will be to use only star - forming hosts in the hubble flow sample , which have similar physical properties to the nearby cepheid - calibrated sample and will better control for unknown biases in metallicity , dust , or progenitor age .    adopting the 47.2% snia@xmath15 fraction we find for r11 and the 7.0% snia@xmath15 fraction found by r15 for the cepheid sample with equation [ eq : h0 ]",
    ", we find no evidence for a reduced value of h@xmath2 .",
    "following r15 , if we were to replace the host mass step with the lsf step , our measurement suggests a 0.1% increase in h@xmath2 because the size of the lsf correction is slightly less than the size of the host mass correction .",
    "one caveat is that r11 added the mlcs intrinsic snia dispersion but not the full apparent intrinsic dispersion in quadrature to the distance modulus uncertainties in their hubble flow sne .",
    "we find that forcing our maximum likelihood gaussian model to use only the mlcs intrinsic dispersion of 0.08 mag raises the magnitude of the r@xmath75 lsf step we derive to 0.045@xmath30.019 ( a 2.4@xmath1 detection , but 2.1@xmath1 with systematic uncertainty added )",
    ". this could be because it allows outliers to have a greater effect on the measurement .",
    "however , applying this correction after removing the host mass step still only results in a reduction in h@xmath2 of 0.11 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 .",
    "the r11 value for h@xmath2 is within the 1@xmath1 uncertainty of the lsf step .",
    "the highest lsf step we are able to find using all our analysis variants with 0.08 mag dispersion is 0.066@xmath30.22 mag ( the 2.5@xmath1-clipped variant ) , and even this extreme measurement lowers h@xmath2 by only 0.4 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 .    finally , if we measure the lsf step _",
    "after _ host mass correction using masses from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* % of the r11 sample ) and again using a dispersion of 0.08 mag , we find a lsf step of 0.023@xmath30.027 ( stat+sys ) mag for r@xmath75 .",
    "this results in a small reduction of 0.3 km s@xmath32 mpc@xmath32 .",
    "because we detect this effect at @xmath291@xmath1 ( with systematic error added in quadrature ) , we do not believe a correction is justified .",
    "although we have only detected the lsf step at low significance with galex fuv data , galex alone is not the best tool for studying local regions due to its large psf width and the uncertain uv extinction correction .",
    "the lsf step would be best identified in local h@xmath16 ( e.g. @xcite ) , high - resolution uv data from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , or local sed fitting .",
    "table [ table : rigaultcomp ] shows that sample selection has a significant effect on our results .",
    "we suggest that studies examining host galaxy effects use the same snia samples and selection criteria as the latest cosmology analyses when possible",
    ". it may be possible to detect the lsf step or differences in dispersion at higher significance using different light curve or distance modulus cuts , but the results of such analyses would not necessarily apply to typical measurements of cosmological parameters .",
    "local sed fitting may be the optimal approach for studying the relation between host galaxy properties and snia distances , as it can put simultaneous ( albeit sometimes degenerate ) constraints on a number of parameters that may correlate with snia distances such as stellar age , extinction , star formation history , and mass contained in a local region .",
    "approaches that do nt depend entirely on galex data will also be able to measure local regions at higher redshifts and put better contraints on possible redshift - dependent biases .",
    "the size of the samples with which we can examine the effects of host galaxy properties on snia corrected magnitudes will increase dramatically in the next few years .",
    "the ps1 photometric sample alone will consist of up to @xmath02,000 sneia with cosmologically - useful light curves .",
    "the dark energy survey ( des ) will contribute thousands more up to redshifts of @xmath01 .",
    "although measurements of local regions become more difficult at high-@xmath53 , a ground - based optical survey with psf fwhm @xmath01 arcsec will be able to use a much larger sn sample provided the absence of uv data is not prohibitive .",
    "surveys such as ps1 or des are able to examine local regions of 5 kpc diameter , similar in size to the apertures used in this study , up to @xmath101 .",
    "analyzing the same sneia used to determine the most recent values of @xmath5 and h@xmath2 , we find little evidence for a lsf step , which suggests that correcting cosmological parameters for this effect is not necessary .",
    "there is only @xmath1 evidence for the lsf step in r11 mlcs data assuming r@xmath75 ( the r@xmath17 r11 used in their baseline analysis ) and @xmath1 evidence for the lsf step in jla+ps1 salt2 data .",
    "our most significant detection uses mlcs data assuming r@xmath76 , for which we find @xmath1 evidence for a step .",
    "the sizes of both of these steps are greatly reduced compared to the measurement of r15 .",

    ", differences in our @xmath14 measurement and dust correction technique reduced the size of the mlcs lsf step by @xmath020% and increased the salt2 lsf step by @xmath015% . using mlcs sample cuts from r11 reduced the offset by an additional @xmath020% and adding the full r11 sample reduced the offset to @xmath3  mag , likely due to the higher dispersion and better statistics of the full sample . using new distance moduli and sample cuts from only @xcite ( and not h09 ) reduced the salt2 lsf step by 60% and using the full jla+ps1 sample reduced the salt2 step to a value of @xmath3  mag .",
    "mlcs sample cuts have a significant impact on the results .",
    "mlcs hubble diagram residuals are more negative at greater a@xmath17 and @xmath89 , which must be carefully taken into account in cosmological analyses .",
    "in particular , passive hosts are known to have preferentially higher @xmath89 but lower a@xmath17 ( h09 ) .",
    "we suspect that because the r15 sample had few high - a@xmath17 sne but a wide range of @xmath89 , their locally star - forming sne had preferentially fainter hubble residuals .",
    "we found that jla+ps1 sne fit with salt2 had lower dispersion than mlcs - fit r11 sne in star - forming _ or _ passive environments .",
    "we also found that locally star - forming sne in our sample did not have lower dispersion at  @xmath8 -2.9 .",
    "in mlcs with r@xmath77 , sneia in locally passive environments have lower dispersion than those in locally star - forming environments by @xmath00.09 mag , a 2.5@xmath1 result . using mlcs with r@xmath75",
    ", we see a 0.053@xmath30.029 mag difference .",
    "the lowest snia dispersions come from using salt2 distance moduli .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , with mlcs we found no evidence that sne in highly star - forming environments have lower dispersion than locally passive sne using r@xmath76 .",
    "with r@xmath77 we found that sne in star - forming environments had _ greater _ dispersion ( @xmath01 - 2@xmath1 significance ) , but note that we did not make the @xcite sample cuts .",
    "we can only reproduce the @xcite results by using their strict cuts on the sn light curve parameters @xmath89 and @xmath28 and removing sne with hubble residuals @xmath80.3 mag , which restricts our sample to largely the same data as @xcite . the lsf step may also be difficult to detect because of the large psf width of galex and it",
    "may also be that the lsf step is only apparent in analyses with certain types of light curve selection or outlier rejection .",
    "future studies with local h@xmath16 , sed fitting , or hst uv observations will have an improved ability to detect local effects .",
    "our results also show that certain sn sample cuts may inadvertently increase biases in cosmology .",
    "we expect that with the large snia samples from ps1 and des that will be published in the next few years , the systematic uncertainties on h@xmath2 and the dark energy equation of state will come into clearer focus .",
    "this work would not have been possible without comments , suggestions , and other assistance from mickael rigault .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referee and pat kelly for many useful comments and suggestions .",
    "the only significant difference between our method of measuring the maximum likelihood lsf step and hubble residual dispersions and the r15 method is that we allowed the intrinsic dispersion of both snia populations ( ia@xmath15 and ia@xmath16 ) to be fit by our maximum likelihood model .",
    "we describe our full procedure below .",
    "we first converted the dust - corrected fuv flux into @xmath22 following r15 ( their equation 1 ) .",
    "we set the boundary between the locally star - forming and locally passive population at log(@xmath14 ) @xmath102 as in r15 , and measured the probability that the snia exploded in a locally passive environment based on the full probability distribution from our dust - corrected photometric measurements .",
    "we used these probabilities to construct a maximum likelihood model assuming two gaussian populations of sne with different mean hubble residuals and dispersions .",
    "the likelihood is determined by the equation : @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the corrected magnitude and @xmath105 is the corrected magnitude uncertainty of a given snia .",
    "p(ia@xmath16 ) and p(ia@xmath15 ) are the probabilities that the sn environment is locally star - forming or locally passive , respectively .",
    "@xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are free parameters equal to the means and standard deviations of the normal distributions of sneia@xmath16 and ia@xmath15 .",
    "to determine what these parameters are , we found the maximum likelihood model by minimizing :        instead of adding an intrinsic dispersion term in quadrature to the hubble residuals such that the reduced @xmath34 of the sample is 1 , as is commonly done in cosmological analyses ( and in r15 ) , we fit to the standard deviations of our gaussian maximum likelihood model for sneia@xmath16 and ia@xmath15",
