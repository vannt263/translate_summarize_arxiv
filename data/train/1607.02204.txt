    "video surveillance systems are now ubiquitous in public areas such as airports , train stations or even city wide .",
    "these systems are typically implemented in the form of camera networks and cover very large areas , with limited or no overlap between different camera views .",
    "they should be able to track a person throughout the network , matching detections of the same person in different camera views , irrespectively of view and illumination changes , as well as pose and scale variations of the person . matching person detections across a camera network",
    "is typically referred as _ re - identification_.    in this paper , we propose a solution for person re - identification that grounds on the idea of addressing the extreme variability of person appearance in different camera views through a multiplicity of representations projected onto multiple spaces that emphasize appearance correlation and finally learning the most appropriate combinations for the observed pair . in particular , several texture and color features are extracted from a coarse segmentation of the person image to account for viewpoints and illumination changes . for each feature",
    ", we learn several projection spaces where features from two cameras correlate , using kernel canonical correlation analysis ( kcca ) with different kernels .",
    "finally , matching between two views is obtained by exploiting logistic regression to weigh the contributions of feature projections .",
    "re - identification has been an active subject of research for several years .",
    "we review the most important works in the following .",
    "these methods concentrate on the definition of descriptors that are able to capture as much as possible the variability of person appearance in different views . among the best performing proposals in this class ,",
    "the symmetry - driven accumulation of local features ( sdalf ) descriptor  @xcite takes into account image segments of physical parts of the human body such as the head , torso , and legs , obtained from the computation of axis symmetry and asymmetry and background modeling . for each segment ,",
    "color information is represented by weighted hsv color histograms and maximally stable color regions , and texture information is encoded as recurrent highly - structured patches . in",
    "@xcite the same authors proposed to fit a custom pictorial structure ( cps ) model on a person detection estimating the head , chest , thighs and legs positions .",
    "each part is then described by a hsv color histogram and maximally stable color regions ( mscr ) .",
    "such part - based models , while well performing for ideal camera takes , have poor performance in real scenarios , due to the fact that image quality is often low so that it is hard to precisely detect body parts .",
    "as opposed to the design of hand - crafted features , some authors have exploited deep convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) to build a representation that captures the variability of person appearance across views .",
    "one of the first re - identification works in this class was  @xcite .",
    "successively , in  @xcite , the same authors improved their solution by employing a cnn in a `` siamese '' configuration to jointly learn the color feature , texture feature and the distance function in a unified framework ( improved dml ) .",
    "similar to  @xcite , ahmed _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a siamese deep network architecture that learns jointly feature representation and terminates with a logistic regression loss to discriminate between pairs of target in a same / not - same fashion ( siamese cnn ) . finally , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a novel filter pairing neural network ( fpnn ) with six - layers to jointly handle photometric and geometric transforms .",
    "while deep learning has had a big impact in general image recognition and recently in face recognition  @xcite , the use of deep network - based representations for re - identification is negatively affected by low resolution images as usually occur in re - identification contexts and requires the availability of a huge number of person image pairs from different cameras to train a discriminative model .      this class of methods is the most populated and grounds on the idea of learning classifiers and metrics to recognize persons across views .",
    "they currently score the state of the art performance of re - identification . in  @xcite",
    "the authors proposed a mahalanobis based distance learning that exploits equivalence constraints derived from target labels ( kissme ) .",
    "the authors of  @xcite proposed an impostor - based metric learning method ( eiml ) , based on a modified version of the large margin nearest neighbor ( lmnn )  @xcite algorithm .",
    "the method in  @xcite combined regularized pairwise constrained component analysis , kernel local fisher discriminant analysis , marginal fisher analysis and a ranking ensemble voting scheme with linear , @xmath0 and rbf-@xmath0 kernels to extensively evaluate person re - identification performances ( klmm ) . similarly to  @xcite , the approach in  @xcite introduced an explicit non - linear transformation for the original feature space and learned a linear similarity projection matrix ( sltrl ) by maximizing the top - heavy ranking loss instead of a loss defined by the area under the curve .",
    "remarkable performance has been also obtained by  @xcite .",
    "the former combined an ensemble of different distance metric learning approaches , minimizing different objective functions , while the latter proposed a novel ensemble model ( ecm ) that combines different color descriptors through metric learning .",
    "the methods proposed in  @xcite rely mainly on dense correspondences and unsupervised learning of features . in  @xcite , a novel method ( esdc ) was proposed that applies adjacency - constrained patch matching to build dense correspondences between image pairs through a saliency learning method in a unsupervised fashion .",
    "the authors of  @xcite extended this method by penalizing patches with inconsistent saliency in order to handle misalignment problems ( salmatch ) .",
    "finally , instead of relying on hand - crafted features , zhao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed to learn mid - level filters ( mfilters ) .",
    "dense patches are clustered together in order to create a hierarchical tree , then the patches inside a node of the tree are used to train a linear svm that is used to discriminate patches between two views . here , the mid filters are represented by the set of svm weights and biases learned over the nodes . differently from  @xcite ,",
    "the method in  @xcite introduced a structure to encode cross - view pattern correspondences ( csl ) that are used jointly with global constraints to exclude spatial misalignments .",
    "the method in  @xcite used salient samples from probe and gallery to build a set of prototypes .",
    "these prototypes are used to weigh the features according to their discriminative power by using partial least square ( pls ) .",
    "the final recognition is performed by fusing different rank results . in  @xcite the authors",
    "proposed to encode color using color naming .",
    "in particular , color distributions over color names in different color spaces are fused to generate the final feature representation ( scncd ) . at the end",
    ", the method employs the kissme metric learning framework .",
    "the work  @xcite proposed to address the person recognition problem relying on semantic attributes .",
    "the main underlying idea is that attributes may provide a strong invariant cue for recognition .",
    "instead of relying on manually labeled attributes , the model is trained on fashion photography data .",
    "the attributes are learned as latent variables on top of a superpixel representation .",
    "the authors also transferred the learned model to video - surveillance settings without requiring any surveillance domain supervision .",
    "techniques that deal with cross - view matching were proposed in  @xcite .",
    "these methods are the closest to our approach since they learn feature projections to better perform matching between images of the same person captured from different cameras . in  @xcite",
    "the authors partitioned the image spaces of two camera views into different configurations according to the similarity of cross - view transformations .",
    "then , for each partition , the visual features of an image pair from different views are projected to a common feature space and then matched with softly assigned metrics .",
    "the authors of  @xcite defined the lomo feature which is composed by hsv color histograms over stripes along with a texture descriptor which improves over the classic lbp .",
    "their approach revised the kissme metric learning  @xcite in order to deal with cross - view matching problem as well .",
    "the main contributions of the proposed approach are the following :    * differently from  @xcite our approach for describing a person does not require the detection of image segments that correspond to physical body parts but instead uses a coarse spatial segmentation of the person image into consecutive regions at different heights . * for each region we model the variety of the person appearance in different views through a multiplicity of features , similarly to  @xcite .",
    "* for each feature , we learn a set of projection spaces with different kernels , such that images of the same person coming from different cameras are more easily matched .",
    "this differs from the approaches of  @xcite where a single projection space was learned .",
    "* we use logistic regression to learn weights of projection spaces so that more distinguishing features contribute more to the re - identification and less significant features are dropped out .    in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we expound our person representation , in section  [ sec : feature ] , and discuss in detail the method in section  [ sec : mckcca ] and  [ sec : weightedlatefusion ] . in section  [ sec : experiments ] , we compare performance for re - identification using kcca with multiple kernels with respect to using metric learning .",
    "we also give an overview of the performance of our method with respect to the state - of - the - art methods of person re - identification .",
    "in order to account for spatial distribution of the person appearance , our representation model considers a coarse segmentation of the person image into upper , middle and lower image regions .",
    "texture features are extracted for the whole image and each region and represented with hog  @xcite and local binary pattern ( lbp ) histograms .",
    "for color , a finer segmentation into overlapping stripes is considered for each component ( see figure  [ fig : whos2 ] ) .",
    "color information is modeled by histograms in the hue saturation , rgb and lab color spaces , in order to account for differences in illumination due to different viewpoints .",
    "separate channels are therefore maintained that model the person representation for each feature and each component separately , namely : @xmath1 where the suffix @xmath2 stands for the full ( @xmath3 ) , upper ( @xmath4 ) , middle ( @xmath5 ) and lower ( @xmath6 ) components of our representation .",
    "the person images are resized to the resolution of @xmath7 pixels . for color channels , the contribution of each pixel to each histogram bin",
    "is weighted through a non - isotropic gaussian kernel to decrease background pixels influence without requiring an explicit background segmentation . for texture channels",
    ", we remove 6 pixels from the image border and compute hog descriptor with 4-bin gradient orientation , and the 58-bin lbp .",
    "we learn a common projection space from pairs of images of the same person taken from two different cameras . to this end",
    "we employ kcca  @xcite applied to each channel of our representation .",
    "we introduce the following notation . given a feature channel @xmath8 , being @xmath9 the set of feature vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 the set of feature vectors @xmath12 , respectively for camera @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and using camera @xmath13 for gallery and camera @xmath14 for probe , we define : @xmath15&\\\\ \\mathbf{f}_b(c ) = \\left[~ \\mathbf{f}^t_{b}(c)~ | ~ \\mathbf{f}^p_{b}(c ) ~ \\right ]    \\label{eq : trainingset}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the training sets for the two cameras , @xmath18 is the gallery set of camera @xmath13 and @xmath19 is the probe set for camera @xmath14 .    in the following , for the clarity of exposition , we will omit in the notations the reference to the channel @xmath8 .",
    "kcca constructs the subspace that maximizes the correlation between pairs of variables .",
    "feature mapping into a higher - dimensional space is performed by exploiting the kernel trick .    in our case ,",
    "given corresponding feature vectors from the two cameras , for each channel , we denote @xmath20 and @xmath21 the kernel matrices of pairs from the training sets , @xmath22 the kernel matrix of pairs from the gallery and training sets , and @xmath23 the kernel matrix of pairs from training and probe sets respectively .",
    "the objective of kcca is then to identify the projection weights @xmath24 by solving : @xmath25 the norms of the projection vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 are regularized in order to avoid trivial solutions according to  @xcite .",
    "the top @xmath28 eigenvectors of the standard eigenvalue problem obtained after regularization provide the final gallery and probe data projections : @xmath29 where @xmath30 \\nonumber ,   \\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(1)}\\ldots \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(m)}\\right]\\ ] ] are the learned projections and @xmath31 is the vector of eigenvalues obtained from kcca .",
    "this gives more relevance to those dimensions in the projected space that have higher eigenvalues , so improving the overall matching performance .    in order to improve re - identification , we compute kcca with four different kernels , so to have multiple representations .",
    "namely , we use a linear kernel , a gaussian radial basis function kernel ( rbf ) , a @xmath32 kernel and an exponential @xmath32 kernel .",
    "the distance matrix @xmath33 can be computed , that defines for each kernel and feature channel the cosine distance between the gallery and probe images .",
    "according to our person representation , for each image pair , a distance vector of 80 values ( four components with five features each , and four distinct kernels for kcca ) is defined .",
    "our goal is hence to select and weigh the most appropriate kernel and feature channels such that their combination results into the most effective re - identification .",
    "this is performed by taking subsets of @xmath34 and @xmath35 of equal size and calculating distances between kcca projections through a two - fold cross validation .",
    "learning of the relative distance weight for each combination of kernel and feature channel is obtained with logistic regression .",
    "distance weights @xmath36 are learned through the optimization of the logistic regression function : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the distance vector between the feature vector @xmath39 ( from camera @xmath13 ) and the feature vector @xmath40 ( from camera @xmath14 ) after kcca projection with a _ bias _ term ; @xmath41 accounts for the fact that the two features correspond to the same person in the two views , and @xmath42 is a penalty parameter ( in the experiments set equal to 1 ) .",
    "positive weights indicate a non reliable distance obtained from a combination of kernel and feature channel .",
    "in fact , a large kernel - feature distance , that should correspond to a non matching pair , combined with a positive weight can actually lead to a high matching probability . according to this observation",
    ", we derive an iterative filtering procedure to progressively drop out kernel - feature channels that have positive weights and learn the logistic regression on the remaining distance vectors .",
    "given the learned weights @xmath36 from our iterative logistic regression , we have now a principled way to fuse all the distances @xmath33 together at test time .",
    "the probability @xmath43 between the feature vector @xmath44 ( from camera @xmath13 ) and the feature vector @xmath45 ( from camera @xmath14 ) after kcca projection to be the same person is calculated as : @xmath46 the overall process is represented in figure  [ fig : illustrationmckcca ] and referred to as multi - channel , multi - kernel canonical correlation analysis ( mck - cca ) in the following experiments .",
    "we run our experiments on four standard publicly available datasets for re - identification that are viper  @xcite , prid  @xcite , prid 450s  @xcite and cuhk01  @xcite .",
    "viper  @xcite presents illumination variations and pose changes between pairs of views .",
    "we split the whole set of 632 image pairs randomly into two sets of 316 image pairs , one for training and the other one for testing .",
    "the testing set is further split into a gallery and a probe set .",
    "a single image from the probe set is selected and matched with all the images from the gallery set .",
    "the process is repeated for all images of the probe set and the evaluation procedure is run on the 10 splits publicly available from  @xcite .    the recent prid dataset  @xcite is generally considered being more challenging than viper .",
    "it includes distractors as well as strong illuminations changes across cameras . differently from viper , in this dataset , the person images are acquired from above with similar poses .",
    "camera view @xmath13 contains 385 persons , camera view @xmath14 contains 749 persons , 200 appearing in both views .",
    "these image pairs are randomly split into a training and a test set of equal size . for the evaluation ,",
    "camera @xmath13 is used as probe and camera @xmath14 is used as gallery .",
    "thus , each of the 100 persons in the probe set is searched in a gallery set of 649 persons ( where 549 are distractors ) .",
    "the prid 450s  @xcite has almost the same characteristics of prid but does not include distractors . therefore , despite of the differences in appearance , the experimental setting for this dataset is similar to the one of viper .",
    "this dataset contains 450 person image pairs captured by two cameras and image pairs are split in 225 for training and 225 for test .",
    "the cuhk01  @xcite dataset , also known as cuhk campus dataset , was captured with two camera views in a campus environment . differently from the previous datasets , images in this dataset present high resolution .",
    "persons are mostly captured in a frontal pose from the first camera , and in a profile pose in the second camera with low illumination variations .",
    "this dataset contains 971 persons , and each person has two images in each camera view .",
    "camera @xmath13 captures the frontal view or back view of pedestrians , while camera @xmath14 captures the side views .",
    "the person identities are split into 485 for training and 486 for test .",
    "this datasets provides two evaluation modality : single - shot , one sample per subject ( svss ) and also multi - shot setting with two samples per subject ( mvsm n=2 ) .    the evaluations for viper , prid and prid 450s are conducted following a single - shot protocol .",
    "while on cuhk01 we perform both single- and multi - shot experiments .",
    "all the experiments are averaged over 10 trials .          in this experiment",
    "we compare our strategy to face the variety of person appearance in re - identification learning projection spaces where features from two cameras correlate using kcca , against metric learning applied to our feature model .",
    "in particular , we compare large margin nearest neighbor ( lmnn )  @xcite and logistic discriminant - based metric learning ( ldml )  @xcite techniques with our multi - channel , multi - kernel kcca ( mck - cca ) .",
    "the experimental setting is the following : in all the methods we employ our person descriptor composed of five feature with four components ; then , for each channel as defined in sect .  [ sec : feature ] , we compute the lmnn , ldml and kcca projections .",
    "we finally use the proposed iterative logistic regression fusion scheme to fuse all the distances together .",
    "this experiment is conducted on the viper dataset and the performances are averaged over ten trials .",
    "we report the performance of our mck - cca obtained using only the linear kernel ( mc - linear kcca ) and all the kernels ( mck - cca ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmc_kissme ] we can see how mc - kcca with the linear kernel only , improves over the two metric learning methods , under the same setting .",
    "the mck - cca with all the kernels achieves even higher performance .",
    "this experiment demonstrates that learning two projections , one for each camera , to map the data in a common space where features of the same person are highly correlated is more effective than learning a single metric  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this observation is also supported by other recent methods which also propose the idea of learning both a metric and a common space to handle cross - view matching  @xcite .",
    "we now compare the performance of our approach with state - of - the - art methods .",
    "in particular we provide a side - by - side comparison of the proposed multi - channel , multi - kernel kcca ( mck - cca ) with recent state - of - the - art techniques such as : eiml  @xcite , rplm  @xcite , esdc  @xcite , klmm  @xcite , salmatch  @xcite , pls+prototype  @xcite , siamese cnn  @xcite , csl  @xcite , improved dml  @xcite , ecm  @xcite , sltrl  @xcite , lomo  @xcite , semantic - attribute  @xcite , mfilter  @xcite , ensemble metrics  @xcite , scncd  @xcite . for our method",
    "we both consider the case in which logistic regression with and without iterative filtering of the kernel - feature channels is used ( `` mck - cca with lr '' and `` mck - cca with filteredlr '' , respectively ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : sota_viper ] we report the results on the viper dataset .",
    "it is worth noticing that the ensemble metrics and our method , learning multiple metrics and projections respectively , to cope with the variations of pose and illumination of this dataset , score the best results .",
    "it appears that our mck - cca improves of few percentage points at rank-1 with respect to the ensemble metrics .",
    "the lomo+xqda  @xcite method exploits metric learning and performs feature projection into a common space between the two views , as in our solution , although with a different method , but has a much lower performance . finally , among the cnn - based methods the siamese cnn  @xcite has the best performance but clearly does not achieve a state of the art result .",
    "in table  [ tab : sota_prid ] we show the recognition rate at various ranks on the prid dataset .",
    "our method largely has the best performance .",
    "the use of multiple color features and multiple common projection spaces for each of them , permits dealing with the strong illumination differences between the views .",
    "all the solutions using a single representation appear to be less robust .",
    "ensemble metrics achieves 17.9% recognition rate at rank-1 , less than our method of about 10% .",
    "it is worth to notice that our previous method  @xcite using a single feature and kcca projection with a single kernel has comparable performance with ensemble metrics .    in table",
    "[ tab : sota_prid450s ] we report the results on the prid 450s dataset . on this dataset",
    "our mck - cca has similar performance trend and comparable scores with sltrl  @xcite and lomo+xqda  @xcite .",
    "both methods aim at learning transformation of the input to cope with appearance and pose variations .",
    "the sltrl and lomo+xqda methods outperform our method at rank-1 .    on the cuhk01 dataset we performed comparisons for single - shot ( svss ) and multi - shot ( mvsm n=2 ) modalities .",
    "results are presented in table  [ tab : sota_cuhk01s ] and table  [ tab : sota_cuhk01 m ] , respectively .",
    "for both protocols the mck - cca scores the best results .",
    "the capability of kcca to correlate different representations into a common projection space is clearly evident in this case .      in this section ,",
    "we analyze the performance of our iterative fusion scheme by giving insights on how each kernel and channel combination is filtered out by our iterative logistic regression .",
    "additionally , we show the difference in performance between our mck - cca fusion scheme with respect to an early fusion kcca baseline  @xcite .",
    "each plot in figure  [ fig : filtering2 ] shows the probability of weight filtering per dataset : on the y - axes we report the channels , whereas on the x - axes we report the kernels .",
    "moreover , for each figure , on the right part of the matrix , we show how many times a given channel is removed across all the kernels ; instead , at the bottom , we show how many times a kernel is removed , across all the channels .",
    "we can see that mck - cca makes an extensive use of the iterative logistic regression filtering on all the datasets .",
    "viper may be seen as an exception as most of the kernel - channels are often maintained .",
    "our analysis on viper shows that weak channels are represented by hog@xmath47 , lbp@xmath48 and lbp@xmath49 .",
    "these channels correspond to texture features that may be noisy on viper due to the low image resolution .",
    "regarding prid , prid 450s and cuhk01 , we can observe that in general for texture features , the less relevant components are the full and lower region . especially , the lbp@xmath48 and hog@xmath47 are often filtered out .",
    "it is also possible to see that , despite being largely used in literature , the rbf kernel is dropped out more frequently than the other kernels , especially in the cuhk01 dataset .",
    "these three datasets have in common that the channel lab@xmath48 is removed with high probability , while it is working well on viper .",
    "finally , considering all the results presented in tables  [ tab : sota_viper ] ,  [ tab : sota_prid ] ,  [ tab : sota_prid450s ] ,  [ tab : sota_cuhk01s ] ,  [ tab : sota_cuhk01 m ] , we can see that our late fusion outperforms , by a significant margin , a single kcca learned over the stacked features , as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly because of the fact that a late fusion schemes allows maximizing the discriminative power of each kernel - channel combination .",
    "moreover in most of the cases the iterative logistic regression schemes is able to select the most important kernel - channel combination and weigh them in order to give more importance to the most discriminative ones .",
    "we have presented a method to overcome one of the main challenges of cross - view re - identification , that is dealing with drastic appearance changes .",
    "mck - cca grounds on the idea of addressing the extreme variability of person appearance in different camera views through multiple representations .",
    "these representations are projected onto multiple spaces that emphasize appearance correlation using kcca and different kernels .",
    "finally , our solution learns the most appropriate combinations for the observed pair through an iterative logistic regression , producing compelling results on standard re - identification benchmarks .",
    "the proposed technique showed also to be competitive with state - of - the art method based on metric - learning .",
    "investigating the possibility of directly incorporating metric - learning technique into our approach could represent an interesting line of research for future works .",
