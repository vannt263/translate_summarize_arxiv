    "the discovery of superconductivity at @xmath9 = 26 k in lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 has stimulated intensive efforts on searching for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperature , @xmath17 , and revealing their unconventional nature .",
    "@xcite until now , a few series of iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) have been discovered , with a maximum @xmath9 raised to 56 k when la is substituted by other rare earth elements , e.g. , ce , sm , nd , pr and gd , in the @xmath18fe@xmath19o family ( @xmath18 : lanthanoids , @xmath19 : as or p ) .",
    "@xcite the fescs show strong similarities to the copper oxides :  @xcite ( i ) both possess a layered crystal structure and a relative high @xmath9 ; ( ii ) superconductivity seems to be closely tied up with magnetism . on the other hand ,",
    "significant differences have been observed between them .",
    "for example , the parent compounds of fescs are bad metals , in contrast to the mott - insulators in the cuprates .",
    "@xcite the superconducting order parameter of fescs is supposed to be s@xmath20-type ,  @xcite while the cuprates are d - wave superconductors .",
    "@xcite moreover , the fescs show nearly isotropic upper critical fields at low temperature ,  @xcite but the cuprates are rather anisotropic .",
    "@xcite electron doping into the conducting layers via elemental substitutions may induce superconductivity in iron pnictides , but it acts as a cooper pair breaker in the cuprates .",
    "@xcite thus , a detailed study of elemental substitutions on the fe sites may help elucidate the mechanism of superconductivity in iron pnictides .",
    "the @xmath18fe@xmath19o materials consist of alternating @xmath18o and fe@xmath19 blocks along the @xmath21-axis of a tetragonal zrcusias crystal structure .",
    "@xcite the @xmath18o layers act as charge reservoirs while the fe@xmath19 layers are conducting .",
    "superconductivity can be induced by doping either electrons or holes into the @xmath18o layers , as well as doping electrons into the fe@xmath19 layers .",
    "@xcite gdfeaso exhibits a structural / sdw transition around 130 k , followed by an afm transition of gd at 4.2 k.  @xcite partial substitution of gd with th suppresses the structural / sdw transition and then gives rise to superconductivity where @xmath9 reaches a maximum of 56 k at 20% th .",
    "@xcite similarly , a narrow superconducting region was also observed in gdfe@xmath0ir@xmath1aso by fe / ir substitution  @xcite and in gdfeaso@xmath22 by introducing oxygen deficiency .",
    "@xcite    in the past few years , considerable efforts have been devoted to the co - doped @xmath18fe@xmath19o compounds .",
    "however , these were mainly focused on superconductivity and magnetism in the fe - rich materials . on the other hand",
    ", the co - end compounds , namely @xmath18co@xmath19o , demonstrate rich magnetic properties attributed to the interactions between the @xmath6- and @xmath12-electrons .",
    "for example , cecoaso and cecopo exhibit an enhanced sommerfeld coefficient of 200 mj / mol - k@xmath23 , and their co - ions undergo a fm transition at @xmath14 = 75 k.  @xcite lacoaso and lacopo are itinerant ferromagnets with a curie temperature of @xmath24 50 k and 60 k , respectively .",
    "@xcite complex magnetic properties were observed in smcoaso and ndcoaso , in which the co - ions subsequently undergo a fm transition and an afm transition upon cooling from room temperature ,  @xcite followed by an afm transition of the @xmath12-electrons at @xmath25 = 5 k and @xmath26 = 3.5 k.  @xcite in gdcoaso , both co and gd are magnetically ordered too ,  @xcite but there is no systematic study so far .    in order to study the interplay of @xmath6- and @xmath12-electrons and its associated consequences in iron pnictides , here we present a systematic study of the magnetism and superconductivity in gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso by means of measuring the electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , isothermal magnetization and specific heat .",
    "a complete doping - temperature phase diagram is derived for @xmath27 .",
    "it was found that the sdw transition of the fe - ions is quickly suppressed by fe / co substitution and superconductivity occurs over a narrow doping range near the magnetic instability of fe . on the other hand ,",
    "the afm order of gd is rather robust against the fe / co substitution ; it is hardly polarized even in the case that co - ions are ferromagnetically ordered above @xmath13 .",
    "however , the coupling between the gd- and co - spices gives rise to ferrimagnetic behavior on the co - side .",
    "we expect that these results , while revealing the emerging physics raised by the interplay of @xmath6-@xmath12 electrons , should be useful for further understanding the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in iron pnictides .",
    "polycrystalline samples of gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso ( @xmath2 ) were synthesized in evacuated quartz ampoules by a two - step solid state reaction method . high - purity gd ( 99.9@xmath28 ) and as ( 99.999@xmath28 ) chunks , also co@xmath29o@xmath30 ( 99.97@xmath28 ) , fe@xmath31o@xmath29 ( 99.99@xmath28 ) , fe(99.9@xmath28 ) and co(99.9@xmath28 ) powders were used as raw materials .",
    "the dehydrated co@xmath29o@xmath30 and fe@xmath31o@xmath29 were prepared by heating the powders at 1173 k for 10 h in atmosphere .",
    "first , gd and as chunks were mixed and the pure phase gdas was prepared by heating the mixture in a sealed evacuated quartz ampoule at 1073 k for 24 h , and then at 1323 k for 48 h. then , gdas , co@xmath29o@xmath30 , fe@xmath31o@xmath29 , fe and co powders were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio , thoroughly ground , and pressed into pellets .",
    "the entire process was carried out in an argon - filled glove box .",
    "finally , the pellets were placed in alumina crucibles and sealed into evacuated quartz ampoules , then slowly heated to 1323 k at a rate of 100 k / h and kept at this temperature for one week to obtain sintered pellets .",
    "the structure of these polycrystalline samples was characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) at room temperature using a panalytical xpert mrd diffractometer with cu k@xmath32 radiation and a graphite monochromator .",
    "measurements of the dc magnetic susceptibility , electrical resistivity and specific heat were carried out in a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms-5 ) and the physical property measurement system ( ppms-9 ) , respectively .",
    "temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity was measured by a standard four - point method .",
    "co@xmath1aso . ( a ) room temperature xrd patterns of @xmath33 .",
    "the left inset shows the crystal structure and the right one enlarges the ( * 102 * ) peaks .",
    "( b ) lattice parameters as a function of nominal co content .",
    "the inset plots the unit cell volume ( left axis ) and the @xmath34 ratio ( right axis).,width=321 ]    figure 1(a ) plots seven representative xrd patterns of gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso ( @xmath2 ) polycrystalline samples , the other samples showing similar patterns .",
    "the vertical bars on the bottom denote the calculated positions of bragg diffraction of gdfeaso .",
    "all the peaks can be well indexed based on the zrcusias tetragonal structure with the space group p4/nmm , as shown in the left inset of fig.1(a ) .",
    "no obvious impurity phases can be detected , indicating the high quality of these samples .",
    "the shift of the ( * 102 * ) peak toward the right ( larger @xmath35 value ) with increasing @xmath36 , as shown in the right inset of fig.1(a ) , reveals the contraction of crystal lattice with increasing co concentration .",
    "the lattice parameters , refined by the least square fitting for gdfeaso : @xmath37 @xmath38 and gdcoaso : @xmath39 @xmath40 , are in good agreement with reported structural data .",
    "@xcite figure 1(b ) plots the lattice parameters as a function of nominal co concentration .",
    "the @xmath21-axis shrinks significantly while the @xmath41-axis increases slightly with increasing co concentration , which means that fe / co substitution increases the three dimensionality .",
    "this becomes more pronounced above @xmath42 , for which the co - electrons are ferromagnetically ordered at low temperatures . the shrinkage of the @xmath21-axis reduces the distance between gdo and fe(co)as layers , thus , enhances the @xmath6-@xmath12 exchange interactions .",
    "the inset of fig.1(b ) shows the unit cell volume and the @xmath34 ratio versus co concentration , both of which decrease with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "the unit volume decreases by 2.20@xmath28 at @xmath43 .",
    "the shift of the xrd patterns and also the corresponding variation of the lattice parameters suggest that co atoms are successfully incorporated into the lattice .",
    "these results are consistent with other reports on the co - doped lafeaso , cefeaso and ndfeaso compounds .",
    "@xcite      figure 2 plots the temperature dependence of the normalized electrical resistivity of gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso ( @xmath2 ) at zero - field .",
    "the resistive anomaly observed around @xmath44 130 k in gdfeaso characterizes the almost degenerate sdw transition of fe @xmath6-electrons and the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transition .",
    "@xcite upon further decreasing temperature , a resistive kink appears around 3.6 k , as shown by the arrow in the left inset of fig.2(a ) , below which the gd @xmath12-electrons become antiferromagnetically ordered .",
    "@xcite upon partially substituting fe with co , the resistive anomaly at @xmath45 is quickly suppressed and becomes imperceptible around @xmath46 .",
    "meanwhile , superconductivity appears around @xmath36 = 0.07 , and the transition temperature reaches a maximum of @xmath47 k around @xmath11 ( see the right inset of fig.2(a ) ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath48 , no sign of an afm transition can be identified for gd @xmath12-electrons in the electrical resistivity , being different from that of cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 in which a non - zero resistive transition shows up below @xmath9 attributed to the magnetic order of ce .",
    "@xcite however , evidence for the afm transition of gd can be inferred from the magnetic susceptibility ( see below ) . for @xmath49 ,",
    "no superconductivity can be observed down to 3 k , and the afm transition of gd shows up around 4 k. in comparison with the th - doped gdfeaso ,  @xcite the most obvious difference , other than the lower @xmath9 , is the semiconducting behavior observed in the under - doped gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "similar behavior was also observed in cefe@xmath0co@xmath1aso compounds ,  @xcite which can be ascribed to either doping - induced disorders or kondo - like impurities within the feas layers .",
    "further studies are needed to clarify this issue .",
    "( a ) @xmath51 .",
    "( b ) @xmath52 .",
    "the insets expand the low temperature regime.,width=321 ]    figure 2(b ) presents the normalized electrical resistivity for the heavily co - doped samples ( @xmath52 ) , which decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature , showing metallic behavior above 5 k. the electrical resistivity demonstrates a stronger temperature dependence for @xmath53 , which is likely attributed to the fm order of co @xmath6-electrons , even though such a transition is weak in the electrical resistivity .",
    "again , the gd @xmath12-electrons undergo an afm transition below 4 k. in particular , a step - like upturn transition appears at low temperature for @xmath54 , which can be clearly seen from the upper inset of fig.2(b ) .",
    "for example , the electrical resistivity for @xmath55 increases abruptly at 3.9 k and then decreases below 3.2 k. such a resistive upturn might be associated with a gap opening at the afm transition temperature of gd .",
    "the subsequent resistive decrease may arise from a magnetic reorientation , which is observed in the bulk properties too ( see below ) .",
    "this step - like transition disappears in the stoichiometric gdcoaso material , in which only a small kink associated with the afm transition of gd @xmath12-electrons is observed around @xmath16 @xmath10 3.5 k , as shown in the lower inset of fig.2(b ) .",

    "application of a magnetic field shifts the superconducting transition to lower temperatures and significantly broadens the transition width .",
    "the latter is likely attributed to the vortex flow as previously discussed in other fe - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite the insets of fig.3 plot the upper critical fields @xmath58 , which were derived at various resistive drops of the superconducting transition .",
    "following the whh model : @xmath61 $ ] ,  @xcite one can estimate @xmath62@xmath63(0 ) , which gives @xmath62@xmath63(0 ) = 19 t , 32 t and 13 t for @xmath36 = 0.07 , 0.1 and 0.15 , respectively .",
    "the coherence length @xmath64 can be calculated from the ginzburg - landau formula @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the quantum of magnetic flux .",

    "the superconducting volume fraction reaches over 50@xmath28 for @xmath36 = 0.1 , 0.12 and 0.15 .",
    "furthermore , a magnetic transition can be tracked around 4 k as denoted by the arrow in the inset , which marks the magnetic transition of gd inside the superconducting state .",

    "the insets plot the inverse susceptibility as a function of temperature for @xmath74 ( a ) and @xmath43 ( b ) .",
    "the red lines are fits to the curie - weiss law and the black stars are a fit to the mean field model.,width=321 ]        magnetic susceptibility of the non - superconducting samples , measured in a field of @xmath70 = 0.1 t , is presented in fig.5 . to make it clear",
    ", a value of 0.05 emu / mol is added as an offset in fig.5(a ) . for @xmath75 , the magnetic susceptibility @xmath4 shows a peak around 4 k , which corresponds to the afm transition of gd , and is nearly independent of the co doping concentration . in the high temperature range ( @xmath76 200 k )",
    ", the magnetic susceptibility @xmath4 can be well described by the curie - weiss law : @xmath77 , with @xmath78 being a temperature - independent susceptibility , @xmath79 the curie constant and @xmath80 the paramagnetic curie temperature . in the inset of fig.5(a ) , we plot 1/@xmath4 versus @xmath81 for gdfeaso ; the red line is a fit to the curie - weiss law .",
    "the derived effective moment and paramagnetic curie temperature are 8.3@xmath82 and -17.1 k , respectively .",
    "this effective moment is close to but somewhat lager than the free - ion moment of gd , possibly due to the contributions of @xmath83 electrons.@xcite as the fe / co substitution increases beyond @xmath55 , the behavior changes dramatically .",
    "the susceptibility , as shown in fig.5(b ) , rises sharply at a temperature that increases with @xmath36 , reaching 75 k at @xmath43 . the inverse susceptibility for @xmath43",
    "can be also fitted by the curie - weiss law at the temperature above 200 k ( see inset of fig.5(b ) ) , with a slope consistent with a magnetic moment of 7.9 @xmath82 , very close to the free - ion moment of gd .",
    "however , the value of @xmath80 = 2.3 k , is substantially smaller than that of the @xmath74 sample ( fig.5(a ) inset ) .",
    "the downward curvature of the inverse susceptibility is characteristic of a ferrimagnet ,  @xcite in which two magnetic species are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the strong dependence of the transition temperature @xmath14 with co concentration suggests that the fm coupling among co - atoms , rather than strong afm coupling to the gd , is the primary driver of the transition .",
    "we model the behavior within a mean field approach ,  @xcite in which the magnetization of co atoms is given by @xmath84 , and that of the gd by @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86(@xmath87 ) is the curie constant for co(gd ) , @xmath88 is the fm co - co coupling constant and @xmath89 is the afm co - gd coupling .",
    "we assume that @xmath87 follows from the full atomic moment of gd , 7.9@xmath82 , and seek a solution in which @xmath90 and @xmath91 k. the solid star symbols in the inset of fig.5(b ) show a fit to the data with @xmath92 , confirming that the afm coupling between the two species is relatively weak .    despite the weak coupling ,",
    "the large magnetic moment of gd leads to an appreciable magnetization that opposes that of the co , causing a strong decrease in the combined magnetization at low temperature .",
    "the data in fig.6 confirm this picture , which plots the field dependence of magnetization at different temperatures with the magnetic field up to 2 t. below @xmath93 , the magnetization is strictly linear in field and independent of co concentration . for @xmath53 ,",
    "in which the co moments are ferromagnetically ordered , spontaneous magnetization was observed below the curie temperature @xmath14 and its size increases with increasing the co concentration . for gdcoaso ,",
    "the magnetization reaches 0.39 @xmath82 with a maximum near 60 k. similar results were also reported in lacoaso , ndcoaso and smcoaso compounds with a saturated moment of 0.46@xmath82 , 0.20@xmath82 and 0.18@xmath82 , respectively .",
    "@xcite the saturated moments of co in these compounds are much smaller than 3@xmath82/co@xmath94 as expected for the localized high spin co@xmath94 ion , indicating that the ferromagnetism in the co layer is itinerant in nature .",
    "the fit shown in fig.5 , however , suggests that the co moment is closer to 0.5@xmath82 , indicating that the spontaneous magnetization in fig.6 is reduced by the negative magnetization induced in the gd . at low temperatures ,",
    "the spontaneous magnetization has disappeared and the magnetization is again linear in field .",
    "we expect that the gd blocks order antiferromagnetically at low temperature and tend to align the magnetically - ordered co blocks oppositely .",
    "the type of behavior has been observed by means of neutron scattering in ndcoaso .",
    "@xcite in that case , the afm interactions among the nd atoms and between nd and co are sufficiently strong enough to reorient the fm co layers into an antiparallel alignment .      in order to further characterize the magnetic order of gd 4@xmath95-electrons in gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso",
    ", we also performed measurements of the low temperature specific heat @xmath5 at zero - field .",

    "complex magnetic and superconducting phase diagrams have also been derived in other rare - earth iron pnictides .",
    "resembling that of gdfe@xmath0co@xmath1aso , we found that , in cefe@xmath0co@xmath1aso , the sdw transition of fe @xmath6-electrons is rapidly suppressed by co substitution and superconductivity appears in a narrow doping range with a maximum @xmath9 of 13.5 k.  @xcite the ce @xmath12-electrons form a long - range afm order at low temperatures , showing strong interactions with the @xmath6-electrons on either the fe- or the co - rich side .",
