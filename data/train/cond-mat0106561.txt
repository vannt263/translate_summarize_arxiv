    "the concept of electrostatic screening has been well known since the work by debye and hckel of early @xmath1 century @xcite . in recent years , screening by strongly charged ions was found to result in counterintuitive phenomena such as attraction between like - charged macroions @xcite , and inversion of macroion charges .",
    "charge inversion was studied by experiments using both colloids and biological materials , by analytical theories @xcite , and by monte carlo and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the most direct method to observe charged colloids and macroions is electrophoresis .",
    "this method is also the prime candidate for the technique of observing charge inversion .",
    "although straightforward , this approach involves many questions upon a closer look .",
    "for example , does the macroion drift along with its adsorbed multivalent ions when an external electric field is applied ? how many multivalent ions are attached to the macroion strongly enough to drift together ?",
    "how is the drift affected by the solvent viscosity and the counterflow of monovalent ions ?",
    "what happens when the field becomes very strong ?",
    "what is the field strength sufficient to disrupt the charged complex ?",
    "these are the fundamental questions necessary to address in order to bridge theoretical concepts of charge inversion and experimental observations .",
    "it should be born in mind that electrophoresis in general has quite a few delicate aspects .",
    "some peculiar ones attracted significant attentions recently @xcite ( see also the review article @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the electric field acts not only on the macroions , but on every ion in a solution . in many cases , this leads to effective screening of hydrodynamic interactions which otherwise may be very significant . in the simulations reported below , we have actually observed such short - range screening of hydrodynamic interactions in the system comprising of a macroion , counterions and coions ( sec.[sec.3.2.1 ] ) .",
    "one of the difficulties in simulating charge inversion under electrophoresis consists in subtle interactions of a macroion with surrounding ions and neutral solvent . a naive use of the langevin equation , assuming that every ion ( radius @xmath2 ) in the system is subject to stokesian friction @xmath3 and white noise random forces that balance the friction through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , is not justifiable .",
    "a simple counterexample would be two closely located spheres .",
    "since other particles ( either ions or neutral solvent ) are excluded from the volume between spheres , neither their corresponding friction forces nor random forces add to each other .",
    "one way of going around this problem is to incorporate macroion - solvent interactions using the oseen tensor @xcite .",
    "this is , however , not easy to implement in numerical simulations , because the interactions produce complicated spatial correlations among random forces .",
    "therefore , we address this problem by a direct approach introducing explicit neutral particles to deal with the macroion - salt - solvent interactions in the molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the explicit simulation of the solvent molecules is of course costly . in this paper , with the limited computational resources , we restrict ourselves to the system with only the @xmath0 salt , and no @xmath4 salt .",
    "it is needless to say that in real water solvent there is always some amount of @xmath5 salt . in this sense ,",
    "our present paper demonstrates the principle that charge inversion is a phenomenon observable by a direct electrophoresis experiment .",
    "further study including the @xmath4 salt will be required to compare results with realistic systems . here",
    ", we will specify the deviations arising from the lack of the @xmath4 salt .",
    "also , we will confine ourselves to the study of a single macroion interacting with surrounding salt ions and solvent .",
    "our plan in this study is to examine electrophoresis of a spherically shaped , uniformly charged macroion .",
    "we will systematically measure the mobility of the drifting macroion complex placed under an external electric field by molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we first show that charge inversion does take place in a solution containing multivalent counterions , as manifested by the inverse mobility under the weak electric field .",
    "we then look at the dependences of the reversed mobility on the parameters , such as the concentration of co- and counterions and the surface charge density of the macroion .",
    "finally , we consider the strong electric field regime and show that the strong field disrupts the charge - inverted macroion complex and terminates the charge inversion phenomenon .",
    "we adopt the following model , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 being the units of length , charge and mass , respectively .",
    "( we have in mind @xmath9  and @xmath10 a.m.u . ) a macroion with negative charge @xmath11 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 is surrounded by @xmath14 counterions of a positive charge @xmath15 and @xmath16 coions of a negative charge @xmath17 .",
    "the system is maintained in overall charge neutrality , @xmath18 , which determines @xmath14 for a given @xmath19 .",
    "the mass of the macroion is @xmath20 , and the mass of the co- and counter - ions is @xmath8 .",
    "we also include @xmath21 neutral particles with mass @xmath22 , where we note the mass of water molecule against that of k@xmath23 or ca@xmath24 ions .",
    "approximately one neutral particle is located in every volume element @xmath25@xmath26 inside the simulation domain , excluding the locations already occupied by the macroion and other ions , which typically yields 8000 neutral particles .",
    "these particles are confined in a rectangular box of size @xmath27 , with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "most of the runs are performed for @xmath28 , except one series of the runs intended to test the finite size effect of the domain ( fig.[fig.mu_l ] ) described in sec.[sec.3.2.1 ] .",
    "in addition to the coulomb forces , all particles interact through the repulsive lennard - jones potential @xmath29 $ ] for @xmath30 otherwise . here",
    "@xmath31 is the position vector of the @xmath32-th particle , and @xmath33 is the sum of the radii of two interacting particles , which are chosen as follows : radius of the macroion , @xmath34 , is between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , counterions and coions have radius @xmath6 , and neutral particles @xmath37 .",
    "we relate @xmath38 with the temperature by @xmath39 , and choose @xmath40 ( we assume spatially homogeneous dielectric constant @xmath41 ) .",
    "the bjerrum length is thus @xmath42 . for the parameters of this temperature ,",
    "the valence @xmath43 , and the number of coions @xmath44 , the ionic strength becomes @xmath45 .    after knowing the ionic strength , one is tempted to compute the debye length which turns out to be @xmath46 .",
    "we should emphasize that this number does not have much meaning for the system under study , because we work in the domain very far from applicability of the standard debye - hckel theory .",
    "in particular , the average number of ions in the volume @xmath47 turns out smaller than unity .",
    "this is by no means surprising , because there is no charge inversion in the debye - hckel theory , and to examine charge inversion we need to go to the regime where this theory fails .",
    "since we do not have the @xmath4 salt in our simulation , we should keep in mind that correlations between strongly charged @xmath48-ions may be significant even away from the macroion .",
    "indeed , in the theory of charge inversion @xcite , the role of correlations is emphasized for the @xmath48-ions in the vicinity of the macroion , where their concentration is particularly large . in our system , the concentration of the @xmath48-ions is not very small even in the bulk , and we face the situations in which correlations between the @xmath48-ions away from the macroion affect our results . for such cases , we make additional runs with the reduced concentration in the @xmath0 salt .",
    "however , we do not use this reduced concentration for all the runs , because such system is more prone to noises and fluctuations , requiring larger statistics to obtain reliable results .",
    "calculation of the coulomb forces under the periodic boundary conditions involves the charge sum in the first brillouin zone and their infinite mirror images ( the ewald sum@xcite ) .",
    "the sum is calculated with the use of the pppm algorithm @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath49 spatial meshes for the calculation of the reciprocal space contributions to the coulomb forces , with the ewald parameter @xmath50 and the real - space cutoff @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the radius of the @xmath32-th ion .",
    "a uniform electric field @xmath53 is applied in the @xmath54-direction .",
    "when starting the molecular dynamics simulation run , we prepare an initial state by randomly positioning all the ions and neutral particles in the simulation domain and giving maxwell - distributed random velocities corresponding to the temperature @xmath55 .",
    "we integrate the newton equations of motion with the use of the leapfrog method @xcite , which is equivalent to the verlet algorithm . in the absence of the electric field ( @xmath56 )",
    ", our system is closed , and its energy is conserved . after an initial transient phase , the distribution of velocities relaxes to a maxwellian , corresponding to an equilibrium sampling of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this new maxwell distribution has the temperature @xmath57 , which is a little higher than @xmath55 , because of the release of the potential energy due to screening , i.e. , local balancing of charges .",
    "we adjust @xmath55 such that @xmath58 .",
    "this makes @xmath38 to be the unique relevant scale of energy , and , accordingly , we put @xmath59 as the unit of time .",
    "we choose @xmath60 as the integration time step .",
    "the simulation runs are executed up to @xmath61 .",
    "when an external electric field is present , it performs work on the system .",
    "the corresponding energy , which is the joule heat , is transferred to background neutral particles through collisions with accelerated ions . in our work",
    ", we simulate an electrophoretic bath that is kept at a constant temperature @xmath57 . for this purpose , we pretend that all neutral particles go through the thermal bath of infinite heat capacitance , whenever they cross the boundaries of the simulation domain ( at the center of which the macroion is located at every moment ) .",
    "operationally , we refresh the velocities of the neutral particles according to the thermal distribution when they cross the domain boundaries . this procedure maintains temperature stably to within 5% .",
    "two closely related factors are potentially dangerous as they might affect the molecular dynamics simulation results .",
    "one factor is the finite - size of the simulation domain , and the other is the long - range character of both hydrodynamic and coulomb interactions .",
    "these problems become particularly important because some of the methods to simulate a constant temperature thermal bath are believed to lead to the screening of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "this is obviously not acceptable in the simulation where the long range character of hydrodynamic interactions is expected to be important @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we argue that hydrodynamic interactions are in fact effectively screened in our system and , therefore , that the domain size in our simulation is quite sufficient and the heat bath procedure described above is benign and reliable .",
    "to understand the situation , it is worth discussing the major point - the screening of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "to begin with , why are hydrodynamic interactions long ranged ?",
    "that fact can be understood well from the point of view of momentum conservation .",
    "consider a particle immersed in a fluid and suppose that we pull this particle with an externally applied force ( such as gravity ) .",
    "obviously , this force transfers momentum into the system and , however large the container may be , this momentum must be transported away through the container walls .",
    "this necessitates the long range character of the hydrodynamic field .",
    "more accurately , if we surround our object by an arbitrarily large closed surface , then ( under the stationary conditions ) the outflow of momentum through this surface must be equal to the inflow of momentum due to the external force .",
    "because of the obvious analogy with the gauss theorem in electrostatics , we see that hydrodynamic field is just as long ranged as the coulomb field ( even though it has a more complicated vector structure ) .",
    "the above description must be modified significantly when the applied external force is due to the electric field and the solution is neutral as a whole . in this case , there is no overall inflow of momentum into the system , and therefore , there should not be any outflow through the walls of the container .",
    "more specifically , if there is one negatively charged macroion as in our simulation , it is surrounded by positively charged counterions and negatively charged coions such that the total charge of the crowd effectively vanishes at some finite distance . in the simple case of the debye - hckel theory",
    ", this happens at about the debye screening length @xmath62 from the macroion surface .",
    "therefore , no momentum is transported further away , and hydrodynamic interactions are screened at the distances of the order of @xmath62 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we treat a more complicated situation in which the debye - hckel theory does not apply and it is not easy to judge _ a priori _ at which distances the hydrodynamic interactions are screened . nevertheless ,",
    "since the system is neutral , hydrodynamic interactions must be screened .",
    "we therefore perform special test ( described in sec.[sec.3.2.1 ] ) looking at the dependence of the macroion drift on the simulation domain size .",
    "we find that the drift is essentially size - independent at @xmath63 which is the direct manifestation of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "since hydrodynamic interactions are screened , our simulation is not very sensitive to the method of maintaining the constant temperature . to test it",
    ", we have performed separate runs at weak electric fields , @xmath64 , in which case we can run the simulation even without any heat drainage for a significant period of time before any noticeable heating of the system ; the results of these control runs are within error bars of the data obtained using the thermal bath ( fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] ) .",
    "our simulation results are shown in figs.1 - 7 . fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] is a birds - eye view of ( a ) all the ions and ( b ) the vicinity of the macroion .",
    "counterions are shown in light blue and coions in dark blue ( neutral atoms are not shown ) . in this figure ,",
    "the macroion charge is taken to be @xmath65 , its radius @xmath66 , counterion valence @xmath67 , and the electric field @xmath68 .",
    "it is seen that the macroion is predominantly covered by the counterions . as in the case without the electric field @xcite , the radially integrated charge has a sharp positive peak at a distance about @xmath6 from the macroion surface .",
    "this peak is due to the positive counterions being adsorbed on the macroion surface .",
    "the value of the peak charge under the conditions of fig.[fig.1 ] is @xmath69 demonstrates the time history of ( a ) the `` peak '' charge and ( b ) the macroion drift speed for the parameters of fig.[fig.1 ] . at time @xmath70 , we switch on the external electric field .",
    "there is a short transient phase during which a charge - inverted complex is formed through adsorption of counterions to the macroion and condensation of coions on the counterions .",
    "this process is reflected in a rather quick rise in @xmath71 , as is shown in fig.[fig.t_hist](a ) .",
    "after the transient phase , we observe a drift of the macroion in the _ positive _ direction along the applied field .",
    "the fact that the drift velocity is positive for the negative bare charge of the macroion ( @xmath72 ) is a direct manifestation of charge inversion such that counterions are so strongly bound that they pull the macroion with their motion .",
    "note that the drift velocity shown in fig.[fig.t_hist](b ) is small compared to the thermal velocity @xmath73 of neutral particles , @xmath74 . under this condition ,",
    "exchange of momentum between the macroion and neutral particles is slow , and it requires many collisions ( compare the similar system in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in terms of hydrodynamics , we are in the linear regime .",
    "it means that friction force should be linear in the macroion velocity and we expect the average drift speed to be given by the force balance condition , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the effective net charge of the macroion complex and @xmath77 is the hydrodynamic friction coefficient .",
    "we shall discuss later the possibilities of determination of the effective net charge @xmath78 based on this condition .",
    "[ fig.t_hist ] also shows significant temporal fluctuations in the drift speed .",
    "inspection reveals that they are larger than what one expects for random kicks of neutral particles .",
    "these fluctuations indicate that neither the counterions permanently stick to fixed points on the macroion nor the coions attach to the counterions , but that they are being replaced from time to time .",
    "the fluctuations of this type are actually seen in a video movie .",
    "the dependence of the average macroion drift speed @xmath79 on the electric field is shown in fig.[fig.vx_e ] . in this figure",
    ", we show together the results of several runs , corresponding to different values of the macroion charge @xmath80 and macroion radius @xmath81 .",
    "first and foremost , the sign of the drift velocity in moderate fields corresponds to the sign of inverted charge .",
    "this is the central observation of our work .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates the overall pattern of the drift velocity dependence on the applied field , beginning with the linear regime in a weak field , followed eventually by a breakdown of charge inversion in a strong field .",
    "let us discuss the linear drift regime for small electric fields @xmath82 , where @xmath83 increases linearly with the field strength .",
    "this regime corresponds to the usual ohm s law , where the net charge of the complex is insensitive to the strength of the electric field .",
    "a macroion drifts together with its strongly adsorbed counterions as a complex .",
    "that is , the electric field is not strong enough to affect the binding of counterions to the macroion .    at this stage , it is necessary to check the issue of hydrodynamic interactions and their screening . for that purpose ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.mu_l ] the effect of the simulation domain size @xmath27 on the macroion drift speed . by a series of the runs with different domain sizes and under fixed number density of neutral particles and ionic strength ,",
    "we have confirmed that at @xmath84 , which is the domain size for the majority of our simulations , the domain - size dependence is essentially leveled off .",
    "this is to be contrasted with polymer chains @xcite , in which case hydrodynamic interactions lead to the finite size effect essentially linear in @xmath85 .",
    "we have also inspected the fluid flow of neutral particles around the macroion .",
    "when rapid fluctuations are averaged out , this flow field does not exhibit any patterns protruding away from the macroion .",
    "this fact implies that the flow of neutral particles induced by the motion of the macroion and other ions is screened at short distances @xcite .",
    "the saturation of the @xmath85 dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mu_l ] ) and the inspection of neutral particle flow patterns both confirm that hydrodynamic interactions are screened in our system , thus making reliable our simulation approach based on the finite domain and the heat bath .",
    "the thermal bath at the distant boundaries does not affect the measured macroion mobility .",
    "the small electric field regime is characterized by the mobility , @xmath86 .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.mu_qsurf ] as a function of the macroion bare charge @xmath87 , or , more specifically , on the surface charge density of the macroion @xmath88 .",
    "let us now discuss a practically important question : can we determine the effective net charge of the macroion complex @xmath89 based on the data of mobility measurements , i.e. , based on the data of fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] - fig.[fig.mu_salt ] ?",
    "physically , as we have already mentioned , the charge @xmath76 is determined by the force balance condition @xmath75 , or @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , determination of the net charge requires knowledge of both the friction coefficient @xmath77 and the mobility @xmath91 .",
    "importantly , the friction coefficient can not be determined by the usual stokes formula @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the solvent viscosity .",
    "the problem is that the real friction is enhanced by the screening of hydrodynamic interactions @xcite .",
    "the stokes formula is simply understood by that the friction force in general should be proportional to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the length scale over which velocity changes , @xmath96 is the relevant surface area . for the stokes problem",
    ", we have @xmath97 . by contrast ,",
    "when the drift is caused by the action of the electric field on the overall neutral system , the distance @xmath95 becomes much smaller . in the debye - hckel theory",
    ", it turns out to be of the order of the debye screening length , @xmath98 . in this case , the friction coefficient becomes @xmath99 i.e. , it is enhanced by the factor @xmath100 compared to the usual stokesian friction .",
    "although we work under the conditions where the debye - hckel theory is not applicable , and we do not know exactly which length should be there instead of @xmath101 in eq.([eq : friction ] ) , this length is clearly smaller than @xmath102 and independent of @xmath102 . therefore , the friction coefficient is proportional to @xmath103 - unlike more familiar stokes case where it scales like @xmath102 .    under usual circumstances where the charge @xmath76 is known , the friction coefficient scaling as @xmath104 implies that mobility @xmath105 is determined by the _ surface charge density _ , not by the charge and the surface area separately .",
    "this fact was known to m.smoluchowski already a century ago @xcite . in our simulation , effective charge is not known _ a priori _ , and the logic needs to be reversed .",
    "figure [ fig.mu_qsurf ] indicates that mobility @xmath106 is essentially a constant when the macroion bare surface charge density is not too small ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "given that @xmath108 , we conclude that the effective bare charge @xmath90 is proportional to the surface area of the macroion ; namely , charge inversion is characterized by the overcharging density .",
    "this agrees with the theory @xcite .    in order to perform at least very rough quantitative estimate of charge @xmath89 based on the mobility data , we need to know the stokesian friction coefficient @xmath109 ( or equivalently",
    ", we need to know the viscosity of our model solvent ) .",
    "we measure it in a separate molecular dynamics run , by observing an exponential decay of the macroion velocity starting from @xmath110 for the case without an electric field .",
    "we find @xmath111 for a spherical particle of the radius @xmath66 and @xmath112 for the macroion complex with adsorbed counterions and coions .",
    "these two estimates provide lower and upper bounds for the charge @xmath89 .",
    "assuming @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( saturation regime in fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] ) yields the inverted charge @xmath115 between @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this is in rough agreement with the @xmath118 measurements .",
    "special attention must be paid to the small bare surface charge density case , for which fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] indicates the decrease in the reversed mobility . for some cases ,",
    "the reversed mobility even disappears altogether , changing to normal , non - reversed mobility , @xmath119 when the macroion bare surface charge density decreases to about @xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "it turns out that this is the manifestation of correlations between @xmath48-ions in the bulk solution away from the macroion .",
    "indeed , when the macroion is only weakly charged , the correlations of @xmath48-ions in its vicinity are not much stronger than in the bulk , which suppresses charge inversion .",
    "simple estimate shows that , under the conditions when @xmath91 gets small or negative in fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] , the `` wigner cell '' radius of the @xmath48-ions on the macroion surface , @xmath122 ( which is about @xmath123 for @xmath124 and @xmath67 ) becomes comparable to the average spacing between the @xmath48-ions in the bulk .",
    "the inspection of the radial charge distribution functions around the macroion for this case agrees with this interpretation .",
    "it shows that the counterions are loosely bound to the macroion , and that the coions form relatively strong bonds with the counterions and drift together with them .    to examine the above interpretation further , we perform special runs with reduced concentration of the @xmath0 salt",
    ". the results of these runs are shown in fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] with filled circles and triangles for the @xmath125 @xmath126-ions with @xmath127 90 and 30 negative coions , respectively .",
    "as anticipated , with fewer @xmath48-ions in the bulk , charge inversion is not interrupted even at small macroion bare charges .",
    "we regard this a convincing proof that charge inversion occurs at small concentration of the @xmath48-ions _ despite _ a larger entropy penalty .",
    "figure [ fig.mu_qsurf ] also shows with crosses the data of the control run performed under the condition of the weak electric field without any heat drainage ( see sec.[sec.2.2 ] ) .",
    "these data are within error bars of the cases with the simulated thermal bath .",
    "the dependence of the macroion mobility @xmath106 on the valence of the counterions @xmath126 in fig.[fig.mu_z ] is physically interesting , and also important for application purposes . for the cases shown with filled and open circles ,",
    "the surface charge density of the macroion is chosen nearly the same @xmath128 so that they reside in the saturation regime of fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] .",
    "we emphasize that the mobility for these cases is given by the same curve .",
    "the mobility of the macroion is _ negative _ when counterions are monovalent @xmath129 , because there is no charge inversion but only regular debye screening .",
    "thus , the charge inversion phenomenon does not occur in the solution of monovalent salt ( provided that the co- and counter - ions have the equal radius ) . for @xmath130 , charge inversion does take place , as manifested by the _ positive _ mobility .",
    "these observations agree with a previous study for planar charged surfaces @xcite .",
    "a remarkable finding is that the mobility here is maximized for the intermediate valence , @xmath131 , unlike the peak inverted charge that accounts for static charge distribution of mainly counterions @xcite .",
    "it is also noted in fig.[fig.mu_z ] that , when the surface charge density is reduced , both the magnitude of reversed ( positive ) mobility and the range of @xmath126 where it occurs shrink as shown by square symbols in the figure .",
    "the mobility for divalent @xmath48-ions is now negative .",
    "this corresponds to the small surface charge density regime @xmath132 in fig.[fig.mu_qsurf ] .",
    "yet , the mobility is maximized for the intermediate valence , @xmath133 in this case . also shown in fig.[fig.mu_z ] are the results of the control runs performed with reduced number of @xmath48-ions ( discussed above in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig.mu_qsurf ] ) .",
    "they again reproduce the optimal valences for charge inversion .",
    "although somewhat speculative , we can try to apply the result of fig.[fig.mu_z ] to explain the electrophoretic mobility measurements of nucleosome core particles in cation solution @xcite .",
    "what was observed is the increase in the magnitude and range of the cation concentration for occurrence of reversed mobility when spermidine salt ( + 3 ) was replaced with spermine salt ( + 4 ) , while charge reversal was not observed for any concentration of mg@xmath134 .",
    "it is worth stressing that nucleosome particles is a complicated system in which many aspects may be important .",
    "what we would like to say here is that our results may be at least one of the factors relevant to the experiments reported in the literature @xcite .    the dependence of the macroion mobility on the salt ionic strength , @xmath135 is shown in fig.[fig.mu_salt ] for the counterion valence @xmath67 and the temperature @xmath136 . here",
    ", the ionic strength is related to the debye length by @xmath137 .",
    "the mobility increases quite rapidly for small ionic strength , and is well fit by @xmath138 as shown by a dashed curve .",
    "it is a legitimate concern to ask whether the data of fig.[fig.mu_salt ] are affected by the correlations of @xmath48-ions in the bulk which we discussed in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig.mu_qsurf ] .",
    "the answer is negative ; these data correspond to the saturation regime of fig .",
    "[ fig.mu_qsurf ] .",
    "the distance between @xmath48-ions in the bulk drops to the value comparable to the wigner - seitz cell only when @xmath139 gets as large as @xmath140 or more .",
    "the increase in the mobility with ionic strength contradicts the intuition based on the debye - hckel theory , and deserves a comment .",
    "as it is explained in detail in @xcite and understood by a number of authors cited there , charge inversion itself grows with ionic strength .",
    "this happens because charge inversion is the result of interplay between the repulsion of counterions from each other and the attraction of each of them to its own correlation hole .",
    "the latter occurs at a much shorter distance than the former , and only the repulsion is strongly affected by screening .",
    "this is why the amount of charge inversion , hence the macroion mobility , grows with increasing ionic strength .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the quick rise in the reversed mobility at small ionic strength in fig.[fig.mu_salt ] agrees with the colloidal mobility measurement for the case with trivalent salt lacl@xmath141 @xcite .",
    "let us now return to fig.[fig.vx_e ] to discuss the regime that is nonlinear in the applied electric field .",
    "as the figure indicates , the charge - inverted shell around the macroion is destroyed for large electric fields . moreover , the critical field @xmath142 at which this happens is independent of the macroion size , which leads us to an estimate @xmath143 this result is quite interesting .",
    "indeed , @xmath144 is the electric field on the macroion surface produced by the macroion bare charge .",
    "why does the critical field scale with the bare charge of the macroion instead of the net charge of the complex ?",
    "the reason is due to correlations between screening ions .",
    "we noted while discussing fig.[fig.t_hist ] that the counterions on the macroion surface are being replaced from time to time .",
    "consider how one @xmath126-ion can depart from the macroion surface .",
    "since this ion is surrounded by a correlation hole on the surface , its departure requires work against the unscreened bare electric field of the macroion as long as its distance from the surface is smaller than the distance between the adsorbed @xmath126-ions .",
    "therefore , departure from the surface becomes possible when the external field becomes comparable with this unscreened field ; the charge - inverted complex is no longer stable at such a field strength .    the critical electric field in realistic situations",
    "is estimated to be very large .",
    "for the parameters @xmath145and @xmath146 , the critical electric field becomes as large as @xmath147 , where we take into account the dielectric constant of water @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "although the critical field is large , it gives small energy to the electric dipole of a water molecule ,",
    "@xmath149 : @xmath150 . this verifies the use of the model solvent of neutral particles in the present molecular dynamics simulations . in practice",
    ", the applied electric field is not expected to disrupt the charge - inverted macroion complex .",
    "in this paper , we performed molecular dynamics simulations with the use of neutral - particle solvent , and measured the drift speed of a macroion to obtain its mobility under electrophoresis in a multivalent @xmath151 salt solution .",
    "a weak electric field pulled the macroion complex in the direction determined by the net inverted charge , instead of disrupting it .",
    "the reversed mobility of the complex , @xmath152 , was shown to be nearly constant for the weak electric fields .",
    "we showed the functional dependences of mobility in figs.3 , 5 and 6 of sec.[sec.3 ] , respectively , against the electric field strength @xmath53 , the surface charge density of the macroion @xmath153 , and the valence @xmath126 of the counterions .",
    "the mobility was a function of the surface charge density , instead of the bare charge and radius of the macroion separately .",
    "the reversed mobility increased rapidly with the salt ionic strength @xmath154 as @xmath138 .",
    "interestingly , the reversed mobility took a maximal value at the intermediate valence of the counterions @xmath155 .",
    "we confirmed the screening of hydrodynamic interactions at a few debye length .",
    "no specific flow patterns of neutral particles , which one would expect for the sphere moving in a viscous fluid , were detected around a macroion .    in the large field regime , although academic because of its huge value , electrophoresis was strongly nonlinear , and the field stripped the screening counterions off the macroion .",
    "the mobility of the macroion complex dropped significantly from that of the linear regime , and the sign of the mobility flipped back to non - reversed one above the critical electric field , which was approximately half the macroion _ unscreened _ field .    in this study , we explicitly simulated the neutral particles of the solvent to produce a reliable hydrodynamic background .",
    "on the other hand , the limits of computational resources prevented us from inclusion of the @xmath4 salt .",
    "the screening in our system was exclusively accomplished by the @xmath0 salt .",
    "for this reason , we are not ready to make a quantitative comparison of our data with the real experiments . the simulation including the @xmath4 salt is currently under way",
