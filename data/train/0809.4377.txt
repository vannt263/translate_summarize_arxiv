    "<S> this talk brings attention to what is knowable from perturbative qcd theory on two - parton distribution functions in the light of cdf measuruments of the inclusive cross section for double parton scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration has measured a large number of double parton scattering  @xcite providing new and complementary information on the structure of the proton and parton - parton correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of observing two separate hard collisions has been proposed since long  @xcite , and from that has also developed in a number of works  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a brief review of the current situation and some progress in the modeling account of correlated flavour , colour , longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiple interactions require an ansatz for the structure of the incoming beams , i.e. correlations between the constituent partons . as a simple ansatz , </S>",
    "<S> usually , the two - parton distributions are supposed to be the product of two single - parton distributions times a momentum conserving phase space factor . in recent papers  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that this hypothesis is in some contradiction with the leading logarithm approximation of perturbative qcd ( in the framework of which a parton model , as a matter of fact , was established in the quantum field theories  @xcite ) . in order to be clear and to introduce the denotations </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that , for instance , the differential cross section for the four - jet process ( due to the simultaneous interaction of two parton pairs ) is given by  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for the two - jet cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensional factor @xmath2 in the denominator represents the total inelastic cross section which is an estimate of the size of the hadron , @xmath3 ( the factor 2 is introduced due to the identity of the two parton processes ) . with the effective cross section measured by cdf , @xmath4 mb  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one can estimate the transverse size @xmath5 fm , which is too small in comparison with the proton radius @xmath6 extracted from @xmath7 elastic scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively small value of @xmath8 with respect to the naive expectation @xmath9 was , in fact , considered  @xcite as evidence of nontrivial correlation effects in transverse space . </S>",
    "<S> but , apart from these correlations , the longitudinal momentum correlations can also exist and they were investigated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization ansatz is just applied to the two - parton distributions incoming in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fourjet ] ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the single quark / gluon momentum distributions at the scale @xmath12 ( determined by a hard process ) .    </S>",
    "<S> however many parton distribution functions satisfy the generalized gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi - dokshitzer ( glapd ) evolution equations derived for the first time in refs  @xcite as well as single parton distributions satisfy more known and cited glapd equations  @xcite . under certain initial conditions these generalized equations </S>",
    "<S> lead to solutions , which are identical with the jet calculus rules proposed originally for multiparton fragmentation functions by konishi - ukawa - veneziano  @xcite and are in some contradiction with the factorization hypothesis ( [ factoriz ] ) . here </S>",
    "<S> one should note that at the parton level this is the strict assertion within the leading logarithm approximation .      </S>",
    "<S> we will not write the kernels @xmath21 explicitly and derive the generalized equations for two - parton distributions @xmath22 , representing the probability that in a dressed constituent @xmath23 one finds two bare partons of types @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the given longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( referring to  @xcite for details ) , we note only that their solutions can be represented as the convolution of single distributions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this convolution coincides with the jet calculus rules  @xcite as mentioned above and is the generalization of the well - known gribov - lipatov relation installed for single functions  @xcite ( the distribution of bare partons inside a dressed constituent is identical to the distribution of dressed constituents in the fragmentation of a bare parton in the leading logarithm approximation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained solution shows also that the double distribution of partons is _ correlated _ in the leading logarithm approximation : @xmath28    of course , it is interesting to find out the phenomenological issue of this parton level consideration . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done within the well - known factorization of soft and hard stages ( physics of short and long distances ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the equations ( [ e1singl ] ) describe the evolution of parton distributions in a hadron with @xmath29 , if one replaces the index @xmath23 by index @xmath30 only . </S>",
    "<S> however , the initial conditions for new equations at @xmath31 are unknown a priori and must be introduced phenomenologically or must be extracted from experiments or some models dealing with physics of long distances [ at the parton level : @xmath32 ;  @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the solution of the generalized glapd evolution equations with the given initial condition may be written as before via the convolution of single distributions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows that if the two - parton distributions are factorized at some scale @xmath15 , then the evolution violates this factorization _ inevitably _ at any different scale ( @xmath34 ) , apart from the violation due to the kinematic correlations induced by the momentum conservation . for a practical employment </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to know the degree of this violation . </S>",
    "<S> partly this problem was investigated theoretically in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and for the two - particle correlations of fragmentation functions in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that technique is based on the mellin transformation of distribution functions and the asymptotic behaviour can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> namely , with the growth of @xmath35 the correlation term becomes _ dominant _ for finite @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite and thus the two - parton distribution functions `` forget '' the initial conditions unknown a priori and the correlations perturbatively calculated appear .    </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic prediction `` teaches '' us a tendency only and tells nothing about the values of @xmath36 beginning from which the correlations are significant . </S>",
    "<S> naturally numerical estimations can give an answer to this specific question . </S>",
    "<S> we do it using the cteq fit  @xcite for single distributions as an input . </S>",
    "<S> the nonperturbative initial conditions @xmath37 are specified in a parametrized form at a fixed low - energy scale @xmath38 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the particular function forms and the value of @xmath39 are not crucial for the cteq global analysis at the flexible enough parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> the results of numerical calculations are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 for the ratio : @xmath40    [ fig1 ]    figure  1 shows that at the scale of cdf hard process ( @xmath41 gev ) the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) is nearly 10@xmath42 and increases right up to 30@xmath42 at the lhc scale ( @xmath43 gev ) for the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath44 accessible to these measurements . for the finite longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath45 the correlations are large right up to 90@xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> they become important in more and more @xmath46 region with the growth of @xmath47 in accordance with the predicted qcd asymptotic behaviour  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlation effect is strengthened insignificantly ( up to 2@xmath42 ) for the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath44 when starting from the slightly lower value @xmath48 gev ( early used by cteq collaboration ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude also that @xmath49 at @xmath50 most likely , calculating this ratio ( @xmath51 ) at @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> seemingly the correction to the double gluon - gluon distributions at the cdf scale can be smoothly absorbed by uncertainties in the @xmath53 increasing the transverse effective size @xmath54 by a such way . </S>",
    "<S> but this augmentation is still not enough to solve a problem of the relatively small value of @xmath54 with respect to the proton radius without nontrivial correlation effects in transverse space  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently a nonminor role of the qcd evolution of multiparton distribution functions has been also demonstrated  @xcite . in the case of multiple production of @xmath55 bosons with equal sign </S>",
    "<S> , the terms with correlations may represent a correction of the order of 40@xmath42 of the cross sections , for @xmath56 collisions at 1 tev c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy , and a correction of the order of 20@xmath42 at 14 tev . in the case of @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> pairs the correction terms are of the order of 10 - 15@xmath42 at 1 tev and of the order of 5@xmath42 at 14 tev .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical estimations show that the leading logarithm perturbative qcd correlations are quite comparable with the factorized distributions . with increasing a number of observable multiple collisions ( statistic ) the more precise calculations of their cross section ( beyond the factorization hypothesis ) will be needed also . in order to obtain the more delicate their characteristics ( distributions over various kinematic variables ) </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable to implement the qcd evolution of two - parton distribution functions in some monte carlo event generator as this was done for single distributions . </S>"
