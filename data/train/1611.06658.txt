    "( euler 1779 ) given a scalene triangle @xmath0 with @xmath1 the side of middle length , there is a quadrisection @xmath2 and @xmath3 intersecting in a point @xmath4 in the interior of the triangle so that @xmath5 and @xmath6 lie on side @xmath1 and triangle @xmath7 is one of the @xmath8 areas of the quadrisection .",
    "the other areas of the quadrisection are quadrangles",
    ".    euler does not claim that the triangular portion of a quadrisection must lie on the side of middle length .",

    "i became aware of the triangle quadrisection problem when looking up biographical information about jacob bernoulli in connection with a fictional story ( _ an elegant solution _ , by paul robertson , 2013 ) about a young leonard euler and the bernoulli brothers , johann and jacob .",
