    "entanglement , as a crucial resource for quantum information theory , plays a vital role in quantum information processes and its fundamental nonclassical aspect is well recognized @xcite . however , it has recently been demonstrated that entanglement is not the only aspect of quantum correlations both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "consequently , the conventional entanglement - separability framework seems to be inappropriate in the sense of characterizing and quantifying quantum correlations .",
    "therefore , how to qualify and quantify quantumness of correlations remains an open question for us .",
    "aiming to capture the total nonclassical correlations , ollivier and zurek introduced a measure called quantum discord @xcite , which have received a great deal of attention lately @xcite .",
    "they observed two classically identical expressions for the mutual information differ in a quantum case , and realized this difference can be utilized to depict the quantumness of correlations .",
    "consider a composite bipartite sysytem @xmath0 , and let @xmath1 denote the reduced density operator of the part a(b ) .",
    "the quantum mutual information is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that quantum mutual information captures the total correlation of a bipartite quantum system . in order to quantify quantum discord , ollivier and",
    "zurek took a alternative way to generalize the classical mutual information by use of a measurement - based conditional density operator .",
    "if @xmath4 denotes a set of one - dimensional von neumann measurement performed on subsystem b , then the resulting state conditioned on the measurement outcome labeled by k is @xmath5 where probability @xmath6 $ ] , and @xmath7 is the identity operator for part a. note that it was already proven in @xcite for two - qubit states the projective measurement is always the optimal choice for the conditional entropy , and hence the application of generic positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) is not necessary .",
    "the quantum conditional entropy according to this measurement is defined as @xmath8 and the generalized quantum mutual information with respect to this measurement yields @xmath9 by optimizing over all possible von neumann measurement @xmath4 , the quantity @xmath10 can be regarded as a measure of classical information .",
    "the discrepancy between the original quantum mutual information @xmath11 and the measurement - induced quantum mutual information @xmath12 is defined as the so called quantum discord @xmath13 which captures the total quantum correlation . due to the complicated optimization procedure for calculating the classical correlation , the evaluation of quantum discord is a tough task from a computational point of view . up to now",
    ", the analytical expression for quantum discord is only available for bell - diagonal states @xcite and a certain class of x - structured states @xcite .",
    "the most recent work @xcite reveals that a closed expression for the discord of arbitrary states of two qubits can not be obtained .",
    "significantly , this difficulty in computing quantum discord motivated the proposals of alterative definitions of quantum correlations in turn .    as early as in @xcite , luo pointed out that a natural consideration leads us to a measure of quantum correlations as follows @xmath14 where the infimum is taken with respect to all complete local projective measurements @xmath15 , and the reasonable candidates of @xmath16 are the trace distance , the hilbert - schmidt distance , the bures distance , or even the relative entropy ( which is a pseudodistance ) .",
    "based on the concept of relative entropy , modi et al .",
    "presented a unified view of quantum and classical correlations , and this scenario puts all correlations on an equal footing @xcite .",
    "in addition , dakic et al . introduced the following geometric measure of quantum discord using the hilbert - schmidt norm @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the set of zero - discord states and @xmath19 is the square of hilbert - schmidt norm of hermitian operators .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , based on a simplified definition of the geometric discord in ref .",
    "@xcite by luo and fu , the definition eq .",
    "( [ hs - norm ] ) is also a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ distance ] ) .",
    "one can write an arbitrary two - qubit state in the bloch decomposition @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are components of the local bloch vectors , @xmath23 are components of the correlation tensor , and @xmath24 are the three pauli matrices . the geometric measure of quantum discord of eq .",
    "( [ two - qubit ] ) can be evaluated as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a column vector , @xmath27 is a matrix , and @xmath28 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath29 .    interestingly ,",
    "m. d. lang and c. m. caves @xcite considered the level serfaces of quantum discord for bell - diagonal states , and provided a pictorial approach which presented a complete interpretation of the strcture of quantum discord and its dynamic behavior under decoherence . as indicated in @xcite , the phenomenon ( sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence ) investigated in @xcite can be easily seen from the surfaces of constant discord .",
    "inspired by this scenario , it is natural to generalize the use of the geometrical method to the geometric discord .",
    "as one might expect , we gain an keen insight into the dynamics of the geometric discord .",
    "the remainder of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review on the quantum discord and geometric discord with respect to bell - diagonal states and then investigate the level surfaces of the geometric discord . in sec .",
    "iii , we evaluate the dynamic behavior of the geometric discord under decoherence channel based on this pictorial approach , and also verify the hierarchical relationships between the geometric discord and the original one .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the discussion and conclusion .",
    "we begin with the two - qubit bell - diagonal states , which have density operators of the form @xcite @xmath30 where the eigenstates are four bell states @xmath31 with eigenvalues @xmath32 note that each state @xmath33 is associated with a 3-tuple @xmath34 , and this state is physical ( positive operator ) if @xmath35 , that is @xmath36 clearly , the above conditions show that the vector @xmath37 belongs to the tetrahedron @xmath38 with vertices @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ bell ] ) . a bell - diagonal state is separable if and only if its partial transpose is positive . in matrix form",
    ", we can rewrite @xmath43 @xmath44 it can easily be seen that the partial transpose just flips the sign of @xmath45 , thus the physical region of @xmath46 is the reflection of @xmath38 through the plane @xmath47 .",
    "finally , the resulting region of separable bell - diagonal states is the intersection of the two tetrahedra , which belongs to the octahedron @xmath48 with vertices @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( fig . [ bell ] ) @xcite .     and",
    "the zero - discord states are labeled by the red three lines ( cartesian axes ) .",
    "this geometrical picture clearly displays that almost all states have nonzero discord @xcite . ]    to investigate the difference of level surfaces between quantum discord and geometric discord , let us first recall the analytic formulas of them . for original measure of quantum discord ,",
    "the quantum mutual information is given by @xcite @xmath52 the classical correlation is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the quantum discord is the difference of @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath56\\nonumber\\\\ & -\\frac{1+c}{2}\\log_2(1+c)-\\frac{1-c}{2}\\log_2(1-c).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the geometric measure of quantum discord can be obtained explicitly as @xcite @xmath57 one can easily find function @xmath58 possesses symmetry properties @xmath59    in particular , @xmath60 , which means the level surfaces ( without consideration of @xmath38 ) are symmetric with respect to planes @xmath61 , @xmath47 , and @xmath62 , as showed in fig .",
    "[ surface1 ] .",
    "apparently , @xmath63 still holds for quantum discord , but it is usually not the case when we flip the sign of arbitrary variables .    compared with level surfaces of quantum discord depicted in @xcite , the level surfaces of geometric discord are composed of three identical intersecting `` cylinders '' instead of irregular `` tubes '' ( see fig .",
    "[ surface1 ] ) .",
    "the cylinders are running along the three cartesian axes , and their ends are cut off by the valid state tetrahedron @xmath38 .",
    "the cylinders shrink towards the cartesian axes as geometric discord becomes smaller ; meanwhile , if discord increases the structure of cylinders is cut into four identical pieces reaching out towards the vertices of @xmath38 , which stand for the four bell states .",
    "the phenomenon is similar to geometrical picture of quantum discord .",
    "recently , we notice that the geometrical depiction of quantum discord is also investigated for a family of two - qubit states with parallel nonzero bloch vectors @xcite @xmath64 where the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are real constants .",
    "one can also give the matrix form @xmath67    it is usually complicated to evaluate the quantum discord for such a class of states due to optimization procedure @xcite .",
    "however , we can obtain the geometric discord through simple calculation @xmath68 it is worth noting that when the bloch vectors are nonzero ( that is , @xmath69 ) , the geometric objects @xmath38 and @xmath48 will be deformed @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ deform ] ) are given by @xmath70,\\\\ \\nu_{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{4}[(1+c_3)\\pm\\sqrt{(r+s)^2+(c_1-c_2)^2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the deformation of @xmath38 can be demonstrated concerning the positivity property of @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , the constraint condition of the deformation turns into @xcite @xmath71    in fig .",
    "[ surface2 ] , we plot level surfaces of of geometric discord of state @xmath33 defined in eq .",
    "( [ deform ] ) . from these figures ,",
    "one can see that the level surfaces in this case are quite different from the ones represented in @xcite : though the surfaces here also shrinks with the change of @xmath65 and the shrinking rate becomes larger with increasing @xmath65 , the horizontal cylinder - like `` tubes '' are not closed when geometric discord gets smaller [ see fig . [ surface2](a ) ] , and moreover , for large @xmath65 the original contour never moves above the plane @xmath62 [ fig . [ surface2](c)(d ) ] because @xmath60 still holds in this situation .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that level surfaces of geometric discord shrink along with deformation of @xmath38 .",
    "in fig . [ surface2 ] , one can observe that if we consider the deformation , the surfaces is biased toward the @xmath72 region ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) , which is compatible with the results in @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors @xcite have investigated the dissipative dynamics of two - qubit quantum discord under local markovian environments .",
    "following the same method , that is , the kraus operator approach @xcite , it is convenient to obtain analytic formulas to describe the evolution of the geometric discord under decoherence . given an initial state @xmath33 for two qubits a and b , its evolution can be modeled in the kraus representation @xmath75 where @xmath76 are kraus operators , satisfying @xmath77 if the quantum operation is trace - preserving , and the operators @xmath78 denotes the one - qubit decoherence effects . here , we give the kraus operators for some typical kinds of decoherence channels @xcite , and calculate the geometric discord for bell - diagonal states under each channel ( only the final results are shown for simplicity ) .    _ amplitude damping channel : _ kraus operators @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",

    "@xmath98,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath99.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "note that the parametrized time p is responsible for a wide range of physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "for example , for the dephasing channel ( the phase damping and phase flip channels are actually the same quantum operation @xcite , which can also be seen from the calculations above ) , @xmath102 with @xmath103 the decay rate @xcite .",
    "mazzola et al .",
    "@xcite recently observed that with certain initial conditions , quantum discord remains constant for a finite time interval even under decoherence .",
    "thus one is natually led to ask this question : whether such a situation will happen to the geometric discord ? to pursue the previous works , we focus on the dynamics of geometric discord under independent phase flip ( or phase damping ) channels for the two qubits .",
    "we already have the expression for @xmath104 @xmath105,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 remains unchanged ( @xmath109 ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume the initial conditions @xmath110 .",
    "when the time goes on , the geometric discord can be presented as @xmath111 therefore , if we do not expect the geometric discord to be spoiled for a time period , then @xmath112 must keep constant , that is , @xmath113 . in this case , @xmath114 .",
    "in fact , we can gain a more detailed insight into this problem by use of the geometric interpretation of the geometric discord . in fig .",
    "[ surface3 ] , we demonstrate the trajectory traced out by the decohering - state taking the level surface as the background . the straight line @xmath115 lies on the plane @xmath47 and runs along the generating line of `` cylinder '' , until it comes across the vertical `` cylinder '' at @xmath116 , which implies a `` sudden change '' point of geometric discord .",
    "subsequently , the geometric discord decreases monotonically to zero till the trajectory arrives at the @xmath108 axis , when the state becomes completely classical .",
    "region is show , and the orange state tetrahedron @xmath38 and the green separable octahedron @xmath48 are also plotted .",
    "a level surface of constant geometric discord is displayed as a background with the initial conditions @xmath117 , @xmath113 , @xmath118 . ]",
    "it is truly remarkable that , illustrated by the pictorial approach , the initial state must be separable ! to identify this intuitive knowledge , we adopt wootters s `` concurrence '' @xcite to calculate the entanglement . for bell - diagonal state described in eq .",
    "( [ bell - diagonal ] ) ( x - structured state ) , one can easily obtain @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 . since the geometric discord can remain undestroyed under phase flip channels if and only if @xmath113 with initial conditions @xmath122 , the positivity eq .",
    "( [ positivity ] ) reduces to @xmath123 . employing the triangle property @xmath124",
    ", one can easily verify @xmath125 that is to say , @xmath126 , which means the initial state must be separable .    for clarity , we have projected the level surfaces of geometric discord @xmath104 fig . [",
    "projection](a ) and original quantum discord @xmath127 fig .",
    "[ projection](b ) onto the plane @xmath128 for the decohering bell - diagonal state @xmath115 ( the red straight trajectory ) . in fig .",
    "[ projection](a ) , the trajectory coincides with one straight contour line ( @xmath129 ) until it encounters the sudden change point @xmath116 , which indicates the presence of a `` decoherence - free '' evolution for @xmath104 . however , as depicted in the fig .",
    "[ projection](b ) , the same trajectory always `` drills through '' the contour lines , which implies the quantum discord @xmath127 is affected by the decoherence environment from beginning to end .",
    "besides , it should be noted that @xmath104 and @xmath127 share the same sudden change point for bell - diagonal states ( see fig .",
    "[ projection](c ) ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss a brief but interesting application of level surfaces of @xmath104 and @xmath127 .",
    "it is most recently numerically observed that the following hierarchical relationship holds for arbitrary two - qubit states @xcite : @xmath130     and @xmath131 for a given @xmath132 ( @xmath133 in this figure and without considering @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is a direct illustration that contour map of @xmath134 is completely inside contour @xmath131 .",
    "this visual spatial relation identifies eq .",
    "[ comparison ] for bell - diagonal states . ]    in the following , we are still focusing on bell - diagonal states for the sake of simplicity .",
    "if we take @xmath135 as the normalized geometric discord ( it is reasonable because @xmath135 and @xmath127 simultaneously vanish for classical correlated states and reach the maximal value 1 for bell states ) , then we plot the level surfaces of @xmath134 and @xmath131 for a given @xmath136 $ ] in the same picture ( fig .",
    "[ relationship ] ) . by varying @xmath132 ( actually changing @xmath127 ) step by step ,",
    "it is interestingly found that the contour map of @xmath134 is completely inside contour @xmath131 , which means the points on the surfaces of @xmath127 are supposed to occupy a larger @xmath135 than @xmath137 , that is to say , @xmath135 must exceed @xmath138 for a given point on the contour @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , eq . [ comparison ] is verified for bell - diagonal states from a geometric perspective .",
    "note that the authors in @xcite can not give the upper boundary states for the geometric discord at a fixed quantum discord .",
    "however , once we acquire such a class of states , this pictorial tool is still useful to check the relationship between @xmath104 and @xmath127 .",
    "in present work , we have advanced a geometric interpretation of the geometric discord and investigated the level surfaces for this definition of quantum discord . for an arbitrary bell - diagonal states @xmath33 specified by @xmath34",
    ", the nearest zero - discord states should be within @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the zero - discord states can be represented as @xmath142 , so the geometric discord can computed as @xmath143 it is obvious that @xmath144 attains the minimum when @xmath145 . for instance , if we assume @xmath146 , thus @xmath147 .",
    "now the cylinder - like structure of level surfaces of @xmath104 is easy to be understood .    by employing this method ,",
    "we have observed the dynamics of geometric discord under decoherence and interestingly found if we expect the geometric discord to remain constant for a finite period under phase - flip channel , the initial state must be separable .",
    "moreover , this geometric understanding can be applied to verify the hierarchical relationships between @xmath104 and @xmath127 for bell - diagonal states .",
    "our work shows that such a visualization approach can provide more clues to discover new physical phenomenon of quantum correlations , and intuitively it is a useful tool for similar geometric definitions of other physical quantities .",
