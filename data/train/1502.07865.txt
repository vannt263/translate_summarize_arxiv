    "long time ago in 1966 , bloch @xcite studied the pressure variation of the nel temperature , @xmath6 and that of volume ( @xmath7 ) of several transition - metal ( tm ) based antiferromagnetic insulators ( afi ) and came up with the general relationship @xmath8 in the localized - electron limit where perturbative superexchange theory is applicable , the nel temperature can be related to the effective tm - tm hopping interaction ( @xmath9 ) , charge transfer energy ( @xmath10 ) and coulomb interaction ( @xmath11 ) , as @xmath12.\\ ] ] the first term in the above equation is the anderson superexchange term and the second term involves the two electron transfer from the anion .",
    "a theoretical rationalization of the bloch s rule comes from the calculations of the variation of the cation - anion transfer integral @xmath13 with the cation - anion bond length @xmath14 , which varies as @xmath15 .",
    "the calculated values@xcite of @xmath16 using molecular orbital theory or configuration interaction method on transition - metal oxides and flourides , turn out to be in the range 2.5 - 3 .",
    "this leads to @xmath17 , assuming @xmath18 .",
    "experimentally bloch s rule is obeyed by a variety of mott insulators .",
    "however , there are exceptions too . for example , while bloch rule is found to be obeyed in ycro@xmath19 and camno@xmath19 , it was found to fail in lamno@xmath19.@xcite the failure has been explained in terms of breakdown of localized approach used in bloch s formulation .",
    "we note that the cases discussed so far on the pressure dependence of t@xmath20 , all involve oxygen or flourine , _",
    "i.e. _ anions with 2@xmath21 electrons . as is well known , the nature of anionic wavefunction changes as one moves down the column of the periodic table , from 2@xmath21 to 3@xmath21 series and even more to 4@xmath21 and 5@xmath21 series , effecting the tm - anion bonding .",
    "it would therefore be of interest to consider the validity of bloch s criterion in case of tm compounds containing anions like te .",
    "a compound of interest in this context is mnte@xmath0 .",
    "mnte@xmath0 belongs to a large class of pyrite type and related marcasite and arsenopyrite type compounds mx@xmath0 ( m = transition element , x = chalcogen or pnictogen element ) with diverse magnetic and electrical properties .",
    "they range from insulator to metal or even superconductor .",
    "they can be diamagnetic , weakly paramagnetic , ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic etc .",
    "the magnetic semiconductor mnte@xmath0 having a pyrite type crystal structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] , orders below @xmath22 k in type - i antiferromagnetic structure@xcite with the propagation vector @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetic phase transition at @xmath6 was found to be of second order within experimental resolution @xcite although the related other manganese dichalcogenides mns@xmath0 and mnse@xmath0 undergo first - order phase transitions@xcite at @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic structure of mnte@xmath0 had been subject to controversy,@xcite regarding whether the magnetic structure of mnte@xmath0 is of collinear single-*k * or non - collinear triple-*k * type , or whether there is any spin reorientation transition .",
    "burlet _ et al._@xcite resolved this controversy and determined the magnetic structure to be of non - collinear triple-*k * type .",
    "the structure was found to be stable below @xmath6 down to 4.2 k , the lowest temperature at which the magnetic structure was investigated .",
    "the high pressure x - ray diffraction was carried out previously,@xcite to study the pressure induced volume changes in mnte@xmath0 , though no detailed structural analysis was carried out in terms of determination of atomic positions .",
    "also , in a separate study the pressure dependence of nel temperature was obtained from resistivity and mssbauer measurements.@xcite the results of these two studies put together show a large violation of bloch s rule , which however has not been stressed before .",
    "more importantly , a microscopic understanding of this phenomena was lacking .    in the present study , we take up this issue by experimentally revisiting the pressure dependence of the structure and magnetic ordering temperature of mnte@xmath0 in terms of high - pressure powder neutron diffraction measurment , together with first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculation to provide the microscopic understanding .",
    "the neutron diffraction study carried out in the present work , is undoubtedly a more reliable tool to measure the magnetic transition temperatures , compared to resistivity or mssbauer .",
    "in addition , the present neutron diffraction study provide the detailed structural information , which was not available before , based on which our first - principles calculations have been carried out .",
    "our rigorous study confirms and rationalizes the breakdown of bloch s rule in mnte@xmath0 .",
    "high pressure neutron diffraction investigations were done on three neutron powder diffractometers , viz .",
    "pearl at the isis facility in uk , d20 of institute laue - langevin , grenoble and also snap at sns , oak ridge .",
    "pressure was generated by paris - edinburgh pressure cells @xcite and a mixture of 4:1 deuterated methanol : ethanol was used as pressure transmitting medium .",
    "the pearl measurements used anvils made of tungsten carbide and a scattering geometry which restricted the available d - spacing range to below 4.2 @xmath24 , i.e. the magnetic ( 100 ) reflection was not recorded .",
    "rietveld refinements of the patterns to the crystal structure were carried out by the gsas program @xcite .",
    "the experiments on d20 and snap used anvils made of cubic boron nitride @xcite and a scattering geometry which gives access to reflections with larger d - spacings .",
    "the sample temperature was controlled using closed - cycle cryostats ; fast cooling to 77 k was achieved by flooding the cell assembly with liquid n@xmath0 .",
    "the pressure was determined from the known pressure variation @xcite of the lattice parameter of mnte@xmath0 .",
    "dft calculations on the experimentally measured structures were carried out in the plane - wave basis , within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional , as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package.@xcite we used perdew - burke - ernzerhof implementation of gga.@xcite the projector augmented wave potential was used . for the total energy calculation of different spin configurations , we considered a 2 @xmath25 2 @xmath25 1 super - cell containing a total of 48 atoms in the cell . for the self - consistent field calculation ,",
    "an energy cut - off of 600 ev and 4 @xmath25 4 @xmath25 8 monkhorst - pack k - point mesh were found to provide good convergence of the total energy .",
    "the missing correlation at the mn sites beyond gga , was taken into account through supplemented hubbard @xmath11 ( gga+@xmath11 ) calculation@xcite following the dudarev implementation , with choice of @xmath11 = 5.0 ev and hund s coupling , j@xmath26 of 0.8 ev .",
    "variation in @xmath11 value has been studied and found to have no significant effect on the trend .",
    "the pyrite type crystal structure of mnte@xmath0 in the @xmath27 space group has mn atom at @xmath28 and te atom at @xmath29 position .",
    "the cubic lattice parameter @xmath30 and the te positional parameter @xmath31 were refined along with the isotropic atomic displacement parameters of mn and te atoms .",
    "figure [ param ] shows the pressure dependence of the structural parameters of mnte@xmath0 , viz .",
    "lattice parameter , positional parameter @xmath31 of te atom , mn - te and te - te bond lengths and the mn - te - mn and mn - te - te bond angles .",
    "the results are very remarkable and contrary to our naive expectation that the te - te bond distance would continuously decrease with pressure .",
    "instead the bond distance seems to increase slightly at lower pressure but after reaching a maximum at p = 2 gpa it decreases and becomes somewhat flat at about p = 10 gpa .",
    "the two bond angles also show anomalous pressure dependence .",
    "this is expected since all the relevant bond distances and angles are derived from the single te positional parameter @xmath31 and the cubic lattice parameter @xmath30 that decreases with pressure in the usual way .",
    "in contrast , the mn - te bond length is highly pressure sensitive and almost entirely responsible for the pressure - induced volume reduction , suggesting relatively weak mn -te bonds which are susceptible to changes upon application of pressure .",
    "the remarkable pressure response of the te - te bond distance and mn - te - mn and mn - te - te angles should be reflected in the pressure dependence of the superexchange interaction that decides the pressure variation of the nel temperature , as obtained in our first - principles calculations .",
    "[ murnaghan ] shows the pressure variation of the unit cell volume of mnte@xmath0 and its fit with murnaghan equation of state .",
    "the fit gave @xmath32 gpa and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bulk modulus and @xmath35 is its pressure derivative .",
    "the values agree well with the values determined previously from high pressure x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase transition of mnte@xmath0 was first investigated at ambient pressure with the sample ( outside the pressure cell ) fixed to the cold tip of the standard orange cryostat .",
    "[ ambient ] shows neutron powder diffraction intensities of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 magnetic peaks along with the @xmath38 nuclear peak at several temperatures below and close to the antiferromagnetic nel temperature @xmath39 k. fig .",
    "[ critical](a ) shows the temperature variation of the integrated intensity of the @xmath36 magnetic bragg peak .",
    "the intensity of this reflection decreases continuously with increasing temperature and becomes zero at about @xmath22 k. the data just below @xmath6 could be fitted by a power - law exponent @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the integrated intensity , @xmath42 is the saturation value of the intensity at @xmath43 , @xmath6 is the critical temperature and @xmath44 is the power - law exponent .",
    "least - squares fit of the data in the temperature range from @xmath45 to @xmath46 k gave @xmath47 and a nel temperature @xmath48 k. the fitted value of the nel temperature was used to determine the reduced temperature @xmath49 .",
    "we then produced a standard log - log plot shown in fig .",
    "[ critical ] ( b ) to extract the critical exponent @xmath50 from the slope that agreed well with that determined by the least - squares fit .",
    "[ 5gpa ] shows neutron powder diffraction intensities of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 magnetic peaks along with the @xmath38 nuclear peak of mnte@xmath0 under @xmath51 gpa at several temperatures below and above the antiferromagnetic nel temperature .",
    "it is immediately noticed that the application of hydrostatic pressure p = 4.75 gpa increases the nel temperature @xmath39 k of mnte@xmath0 substantially . by fitting the temperature dependence of the intensity of the @xmath36 magnetic peak and fitting the data by a power law we determine @xmath52 k. fig .",
    "7(a ) shows this fit .",
    "similarly we determined the nel temperatures of mnte@xmath0 at several pressures . the result is shown in fig .",
    "the obtained trend agrees well with that obtained from resistivity and mssbauer spectroscopy@xcite , as also shown in fig .",
    "the neutron diffraction results show that @xmath6 of mnte@xmath0 increases linearly in the pressure range @xmath53 gpa at a rate of about @xmath1 k gpa@xmath2 , determined from the slope of the linear plot . from this linear relationship we calculated the t@xmath20 values for the pressures at which we determined the lattice and positional parameters of mnte@xmath0 from the high pressure neutron diffraction experiment on the pearl diffractometer .",
    "7(c ) shows the log - log plot of nel temperature t@xmath20 vs. unit cell volume of mnte@xmath0 .",
    "the slope of this plot gives @xmath54 which is much larger than the bloch rule value of @xmath55 .",
    "our result therefore point towards a spectacular breakdown of bloch s rule in mnte@xmath0 .",
    "we note that transition to a non - magnetic state of the mn@xmath56 ions in mnte@xmath0 was reported@xcite from the resistivity and mssbauer study , and also evidenced by the pressure variation of infrared reflectivity investigated by mita et al .",
    "our experiments however did not show the volume collapse observed in high pressure x - ray diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "it is therefore plausible that we did not reach the transition pressure during the present high pressure neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "the exact pressure at which the transition to a non - magnetic state is expected to happen depends sensitively on the experimental conditions .",
    "the present neutron diffraction data contain in principle the magnetic moment information because neutron diffraction probes both crystal and the magnetic structures and the intensities of the magnetic reflections when put to the absolute scale by using the intensities of the nuclear reflections can give the ordered moment values .",
    "however this is not an easy task especially in a high pressure experiment using a large paris - edinburg pressure cell .",
    "the high absorption of the pressure cell and also a very high background hinders accurate determination of the nuclear and magnetic intensities . in the present case despite our efforts the determination of the pressure dependence of ordered moment from the neutron diffraction data was not successful .",
    "we know however from our calculations ( using pressure dependence of the structural parameters ) that the ordered moment of mn ions does not change at all ( or very little ) in the range 0 - 9 gpa investigated .",
    "the present high pressure neutron diffraction data seem to support this result .",
    "the intensity ratio of the magnetic and nuclear bragg peaks do not change very much and is within the accuracy in the pressure range investigated .",
    "to gain understanding on the significantly large pressure dependence of the nel temperature in mnte@xmath0 we carried out theoretical investigation in terms of first - principles dft calculations .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the comparison of the spin - polarized density of states of mnte@xmath0 at ambient pressure and at a pressure of 9.16 gpa , the highest pressure studied in the present calculations .",
    "the spin - polarized calculations within gga+@xmath11 gave rise to a magnetic moment of 4.6 @xmath57 ( 4.5 @xmath57 ) at mn site together with a moment of 0.03 @xmath57 ( 0.05 @xmath57 ) at te site for the ambient ( p = 9.16 gpa ) pressure condition , suggesting the high - spin state of mn at both ambient and high pressure conditions , in agreement with experimental findings .",
    "both ambient pressure and high pressure phases were found to be insulating , with a gap at fermi energy , marked as zero in the figure .",
    "the mn-@xmath58 states are fully occupied in the majority spin channel and completely empty in minority spin channel , in correspondence with high spin state of mn in its nominal 2 + valence state .",
    "the comparison of the density of states between ambient pressure and at high pressure though , shows enhancement of the mn-@xmath58 band width by @xmath59 1 ev , indicating the hopping interaction between mn-@xmath58 and te@xmath60 to increase substantially in moving from ambient to high pressure phase .",
    "[ bloch ]    to extract the various magnetic interactions ( @xmath61 s ) between the mn spins , we calculated the gga+@xmath11 total energies for various configurations of mn spins and mapped the total energy onto an underlying s = 5/2 heisenberg model .",
    "calculations were carried out for six different pressures , 0.0 gpa , 0.4 gpa , 2.16 gpa , 5.32 gpa , 8.43 gpa and 9.16 gpa .",
    "the dominant magnetic interactions considered in our calculation of @xmath61 s , were @xmath62 , between the first nearest neighbor ( 1nn ) mn atoms , connected to each other by the corner - shared te atoms , and @xmath63 , between the second nearest neighbor ( 2nn ) mn atoms , connected to each other through te - mn - te bridges .",
    "apart from the ferromagnetic ( fm ) configuration , with all mn spins in the supercell pointing in the same direction , two different antiferromagnetic ( afm ) configurations , afm1 and amf2 were considered , with antiferromagnetic arrangement of 1nn mn and 2nn mn spins .",
    "the gga+@xmath11 total energies corresponding to afm configurations , measured with respect to the energy of fm configuration , turned out to be negative , for all the studied pressures , in accordance with dominance of anti - ferromagnetic interactions . extracting j@xmath64 and j@xmath65 by mapping the total energy onto the spin hamiltonian , given by @xmath66 , gave @xmath67 a small fraction of @xmath62 , with @xmath68/@xmath67 = 0.09 at ambient pressure and 0.12 at 9.16 gpa , suggesting the magnetism being primarily governed by @xmath62 .",
    "the pressure dependence of exchange interactions is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "[ bloch ]    with the knowledge of j s , we calculated the nel temperature t@xmath69 using mean - field theory , given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the net effective interaction 12@xmath68 + 4@xmath67 , s = 5/2 , and @xmath72 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "mean field is expected to overestimate the transition temperature , though the trend is expected to captured well , which is governed by @xmath61 s . the computed log[@xmath73(p)/@xmath73(0 ) ] plotted as a function of log(@xmath7 ) is shown in fig .",
    "the straight line fit to the calculated data points gives rise to a slope of -5.61 , close to the experimental estimate of -6.0 @xmath5 0.1 .",
    "both our experimental results and ab - initio calculations , thus establish that bloch s rule is largely violated in mnte@xmath0 . in the following we theoretically investigate the microscopic origin of this behavior .",
    "[ bloch ]      bloch s rule has been found to be very successful with many magnetic insulators , especially the transition metal oxides and fluorides .",
    "the question then arises : what makes the bloch s rule fail for mnte@xmath0 ? in order to explore this , we extracted the hopping interactions @xmath13 , where @xmath74 and @xmath30 signifies mn and te , respectively , by carrying out n - th order muffin - tin orbital ( nmto ) based nmto - downfolding calculations.@xcite this involved construction of real - space representation of the mn @xmath58- o @xmath21 hamiltonian in wannier function basis out of the full dft calculations , by integrating out all the degrees of freedom other than mn @xmath58 and te @xmath21 . our nmto - downfolding calculations to extract the dependence of @xmath13 on cation - anion distance @xmath14 gave , @xmath75 , instead of @xmath76 assumed for derivation of the bloch s rule .",
    "this gives @xmath77 , very close to the estimate obtained from total energy calculations , as well as from the experiment .",
    "this points to the fact that violation of bloch s rule in case of mnte@xmath0 is caused due to the deviation in the distance dependence of @xmath13 , from the @xmath78 behavior rather than that by @xmath11 or @xmath10 .",
    "we find that the distance dependence of @xmath13 found for mnte@xmath0 , is more like the canonical behaviour,@xcite in which the interatomic matrix elements are supposed to scale with distance as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the angular momenta of the orbitals involved . in case of several tm oxides , on the other hand , anaylysis of dft",
    "band structure,@xcite gave rise to a @xmath82 behavior , similar to that obtained from molecular orbital theory or configuration interaction method on knif@xmath83 or mno or mnf@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this presumably originates from differential nature of te 4@xmath21 wavefunctions compared with that of 2@xmath21 or 3@xmath21 , which together with non monotonic pressure dependence of position parameter , x , influences the super - exchange interaction in a differential manner .",
    "in conclusion , the nel temperature of mnte@xmath0 was found to show unusually large pressure dependence of about @xmath1 k gpa@xmath2 , which has been confirmed in the present study through more rigorous and reliable high pressure neutron diffraction experiments compared to that in literature , as well as through first - principles density functional theory calculations .",
    "our measured pressure dependence of the nel temperature and unit cell volume gave @xmath84 which is much larger than that expected from the bloch s rule @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated pressure dependence of nel temperature gave rise to @xmath85 in good agreement with the experimental estimate .",
    "we provided a microscopic understanding of this behavior in terms of the distance dependence of mn - te hopping interaction upon application of pressure , which showed significant deviation from that for nif@xmath83 or mno or mnf@xmath0@xcite .",
    "finally , the large pressure dependence of magnetic interactions and magnetic ordering temperature provide us with a handle to tune the properties of magnetic materials , which can lead to important technological applications .",
    "the present study , should have important bearing on this topic .",
