    "extra gauge bosons , both charged ( @xmath2 ) and/or neutral ( @xmath1 ) , arise in many models of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "examples include extended gauge theories such as grand unified theories @xcite and left - right symmetric models @xcite along with the corresponding supersymmetric models , and other models such as those with finite size extra dimensions @xcite . to elucidate what physics lies beyond the standard model it is necessary to search for manifestations of that new physics with respect to the predicted particle content , both fermions and extra gauge bosons .",
    "such searches are a feature of ongoing collider experiments and the focus of future experiments .",
    "the discovery of new particles would provide definitive evidence for physics beyond the standard model and , in particular , the discovery of new gauge bosons would indicate that the standard model gauge group was in need of extension .",
    "there is a considerable literature on @xmath1 searches . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on @xmath2 searches , for which much less work has been done .",
    "limits have been placed on the existence of new gauge bosons through indirect searches based on the deviations from the sm they would produce in precision electroweak measurements . for instance , indirect limits from @xmath4-decay constrain the lrm @xmath2 to @xmath5 gev @xcite .",
    "a more severe constraint arises from @xmath6 mass - splitting which gives @xmath7  tev @xcite . in obtaining the above limits",
    ", it was assumed that the coupling constants of the two @xmath8 gauge groups are equal .",
    "new gauge boson searches at hadron colliders consider their direct production via the drell - yan process and their subsequent decay to lepton pairs . for @xmath2 bosons ,",
    "decays to hadronic jets are sometimes also considered .",
    "the present bounds on neutral gauge bosons , @xmath1 s , from the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xmath9 collider at fermilab are @xmath10  gev with the exact value depending on the specific model @xcite . for @xmath2 s the limits are @xmath11  gev ; again the limits depend on the details of the model @xcite .",
    "the search reach is expected to increase by @xmath12  gev with 1  fb@xmath13 of luminosity @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider is expected to be able to discover @xmath1 s up to masses of 4 - 5  tev @xcite and @xmath2 s up to masses of @xmath14  tev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 limits assume sm strength couplings and decay into a light stable neutrino which is registered in the detector as missing @xmath15 .",
    "they can be seriously degraded by loosening the assumptions in the model .",
    "in addition , one can place limits on new gauge bosons by looking for deviations from sm expectations for observables measured at @xmath16 and @xmath17 colliders",
    ".    searches for new gauge bosons at @xmath17 colliders are kinematically limited by the available center - of - mass energy so that one searches for indirect effects of extra gauge bosons in cross sections and asymmetries for @xmath18 .",
    "there is a considerable body of work on @xmath1 searches at @xmath19 colliders and , although the discovery limits are very model dependent , they lie in the general range of 2 - 5  tev for @xmath20  gev with 50  fb@xmath13 luminosity @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath1 case , there are virtually no studies of indirect searches for @xmath2 bosons at @xmath17 colliders .",
    "recently , hewett suggested that the reaction @xmath21 would be sensitive to @xmath2 s with masses greater than @xmath22 @xcite . in the standard model",
    ", this process proceeds through @xmath23-channel @xmath24 and @xmath25-channel @xmath26 exchange with the photon being radiated from every possible charged particle . in",
    "extended gauge models the process is modified by both @xmath23-channel @xmath1 and @xmath25-channel @xmath2 exchange . in this paper",
    ", we examine this process for various extended electroweak models . the first model we consider is the left - right symmetric model @xcite based on the gauge group @xmath27 which has right - handed charged currents .",
    "the second model we consider is the un - unified model @xcite which is based on the gauge group @xmath28 where the quarks and leptons each transform under their own @xmath8 .",
    "the final type of model , which has received considerable interest lately , contains the kaluza - klein excitations of the sm gauge bosons which are a possible consequence of theories with large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the models under consideration are described in more detail in section ii . additionally , we study discovery limits for various combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath1 bosons with sm couplings .",
    "although these are not realistic models , they have been adopted as benchmarks to compare the discovery reach of different processes .",
    "we will find that , while the process @xmath29 can indeed extend the discovery reach for @xmath2 s significantly beyond @xmath22 , with the exact limit depending on the specific model , it is not in general competitive with limits obtainable at the lhc .",
    "however , if extra gauge bosons are discovered which are not overly massive , the process considered here could be used to measure their couplings .",
    "this would be crucial for determining the origins of the @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "as such , it would play an important complementary role to the lhc studies .    in the next section we review the relevant details of the various models that we use in our calculations . in section iii",
    ", we describe the details of our calculations .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 discovery limits and projected sensitivities for @xmath2 couplings and @xmath30 couplings are given in section iv .",
    "we conclude with some final comments .",
    "in this section , we describe the models considered in our investigation .",
    "the so - called sequential standard model ( ssm ) includes additional weak gauge bosons of higher mass , with sm couplings .",
    "this is a rather arbitrary scenario which we include only as a benchmark .",
    "since our emphasis here is on extra @xmath26 s , we consider a ssm with a @xmath2 only , which we refer to as ssm(@xmath2 ) , and a ssm with both @xmath2 and @xmath1 , denoted by ssm(@xmath31 ) . in the latter",
    ", we will take @xmath32 for simplicity .",

    "the reverse is true for right - handed fermions .",
    "a right - handed neutrino is included in the fermion content .",
    "the model is parametrized by the ratio of the coupling constants of the two @xmath8 gauge groups , which we denote as @xmath36 .",
    "this parameter is allowed to vary here in the approximate range @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath38 arises from the condition @xmath39 ( or , equivalently , @xmath40 ) , which expresses the positivity of a ratio of squared couplings . in principle , @xmath38 is restricted to be less than 1 based on symmetry breaking scenarios and coupling constant evolution arguments .",
    "however , it is conceivable that this bound may be violated in some grand unified theory so we take a phenomenological approach and loosen this upper bound @xcite .",
    "additionally , a parameter , @xmath41 , describes the higgs content of the model .",
    "if only higgs doublets are used to break the gauge symmetry to @xmath42 , @xmath41 is 1 . for higgs triplets ,",
    "@xmath41 is 2 .",
    "a combination of doublets and triplets leads to an intermediate value of @xmath41 between 1 and 2 @xcite .",

    ", there is a relationship between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses , as follows :    @xmath44    the couplings of the extra gauge bosons relevant to our calculation can be read from the following parts of the lagrangian .",

    "note that we neglect two angles , usually denoted as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which parametrize the @xmath49 and @xmath50 mixings , respectively .",
    "limits on these angles are rather severe so this is justified @xcite .",
    "neglect of these angles implies sm couplings for the @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "additionally , we assume light dirac - type neutrinos .    the un - unified model ( uum ) @xcite employs the alternative electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath51 with left - handed quarks and leptons transforming as doublets under their respective @xmath8 groups .",
    "all the right - handed fields transform as singlets under both @xmath8 groups .",
    "the uum may be parametrized by an angle @xmath52 , which represents the mixing of the charged gauge bosons of the two @xmath8 groups , and by a ratio @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the vacuum expectation values of the scalar multiplets which break the symmetry to @xmath42 .",
    "the existing constraint on @xmath52 is @xmath56 , based on the validity of perturbation theory . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the @xmath1 mass is approximately equal to that of the @xmath2 and the parameter @xmath58 may be replaced by @xmath59 .",
    "the lepton couplings of interest to us here arise from the following part of the lagrangian .",

    "additional fermions must also be included in order to cancel anomalies .",
    "this is rather difficult to do without generating flavour changing neutral currents and some considerations of this problem lead to rather high lower bounds on the @xmath1 mass of about 1.4 tev @xcite .",
    "however , lower @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses may be allowed in other scenarios ; hence we take a phenomenological approach in this investigation .",
    "finally , we consider the consequences of models which have been of considerable interest lately , those containing large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider an extension of the sm to 5-dimensions ( 5dsm ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of an extra dimension of size @xmath61 tev@xmath13 may imply an infinite tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the sm gauge bosons . the mass of the excitations is associated with the compactification scale of the extra dimension as @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , where @xmath64 .",
    "the properties of and relationships among electroweak observables are modified by the presence of these kk towers .",
    "we treat this possibility in a manner similar to the other models described above ; that is , we include in our process the exchange of a @xmath2 and @xmath1 corresponding to the first kk excitations",
    ". the model can be parametrized by an angle @xmath65 which is correlated with the properties of its higgs sector , which includes two doublets ; for @xmath66 , the sm higgs may propagate in all 5-dimensions ( the bulk ) while for @xmath67 , it is confined to the 4-dimensional boundary . in terms of this parameter ,",
    "the physical masses of the lightest electroweak gauge bosons ( corresponding to the experimentally measured masses ) are given , to first order in @xmath68 , as    @xmath69 \\\\ m^{(ph)2}_z & = & m^2_z \\left[1 -   s^4_{\\beta } \\frac{\\pi^2}{3 } \\frac{m^2_z}{m^2_c } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 , as usual.the gauge couplings of the physical @xmath26 and @xmath24 are also modified by a term of order @xmath71 .",
    "global analyses of electroweak parameters put a lower limit on @xmath72 of about 2.5 tev so this is a very small effect .",
    "we will therefore neglect it and thus eliminate @xmath73 as a parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermion coupling of the first kk excitations , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , each of mass @xmath74 , is enhanced by a factor of @xmath75",
    ". hence our consideration of the 5dsm amounts to including a @xmath2 and a @xmath1 , of equal mass , each coupling as in the sm apart from an extra factor of @xmath75 .",
    "the process under consideration is @xmath76 the relevant feynman diagrams are given in fig .  1",
    ". the kinematic observables of interest are the photon s energy , @xmath77 , and its angle relative to the incident electron , @xmath78 , both defined in the @xmath17 center - of - mass frame .",

    "all the essential features are illustrated .",
    "we take the sm inputs @xmath113 gev , @xmath114 gev , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 gev @xcite . since we work only to leading order in @xmath84",

    "further , we restrict the photon s transverse momentum to @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the minimum angle down to which the veto detectors may observe electrons or positrons .",
    "we take @xmath123 mrad .",
    "this cut has the effect of removing the largest background to our process , namely radiative bhabha - scattering where the scattered @xmath106 and @xmath105 go undetected down the beam pipe .",

    "they have been known to @xmath125 for some time @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a short review _ of _ and further references _ to _ higher order qed corrections , and @xcite for a description of a related mc generator .",
    "since our aim is to determine the statistical power of the process in discovering @xmath2 s , there is no need to include in this study the radiative corrections which will only marginally influence the number of events .",
    "complete consistency at nlo , however , would require determination of the bremsstrahlung corrections to the _ generalized _ expression ( [ m2 ] ) and corresponding loop graphs .    as well , we do not explicitly take into account any higher order backgrounds .",
    "a background , which can not be suppressed , comes from the reaction @xmath126 .",
    "the authors of @xcite have provided the following cross sections of relevance here : @xmath127 and   @xmath128 .",
    "these results are for the same conditions as in table  1 of @xcite but for @xmath129 .",
    "the cuts used in obtaining the above numbers differ from ours . nonetheless , these cross sections give an idea of the magnitude of the background .",
    "assuming lepton universality , the total cross section is @xmath130 for the process @xmath126 . imposing our @xmath131 cut will suppress it even further .",
    "this background must be included in an `` @xmath132 + nothing '' analysis of real data .",
    "we expect that the cross sections of @xmath133 and of @xmath134 are so small that they need not be taken into account in the analysis .",
    "the errors generated from the subtraction of the above backgrounds form part of the systematic error .",
    "as the backgrounds themselves are much smaller than the signal , though comparable to the new physics effect , we expect that the error in the sm prediction of the backgrounds would be much smaller than the systematic errors arising from detector and beam uncertainties .",
    "we shall return to the issue of systematics in connection with their influence on the discovery limits presented in the next section .",
    "we have calculated three distinct total cross sections : unpolarized : @xmath135 , for left - handed @xmath105 : @xmath136 , and for right - handed @xmath105 : @xmath137 .",
    "2 shows all three plotted versus @xmath22 , with @xmath136 and @xmath137 calculated using 100% beam polarization .",
    "results are shown for the sm , lrm ( @xmath138 ) , uum ( @xmath139 ) , ssm(@xmath2 ) , ssm(@xmath140 ) and kk model , with @xmath141 gev in each case .",
    "these mass and coupling parameter choices are rather arbitrary , made to illustrate general behaviour .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that in the uum and ssm(@xmath140 ) , the correction to the sm cross section changes sign as @xmath22 is varied .",
    "this arises , for certain @xmath22 and @xmath59 , due to a negative interference term between the sm and @xmath142 diagrams in these models .",
    "it is clear from the presence of the peaks in fig .  2 that we are also probing @xmath1 s , in those models which include them .",
    "( there is also a very sharp peak at lower @xmath22 , off the plot , due to the sm @xmath24 . )",
    "the @xmath1 peaks generally occur for @xmath22 slightly above the @xmath1 mass since the photon carries away some of the energy . at very high energies ,",
    "the sm @xmath24 contribution is negligible .",
    "further , by using a right - handed @xmath105 beam , we can reduce the sm @xmath26 contribution ( depending on the degree of polarization ) .",
    "then we directly probe the @xmath2 ( and @xmath1 ) in the lrm , while in the ssm(@xmath140 ) and kk model , we probe only the @xmath1 .",
    "the latter two models as well as the two remaining models all require some component of left - handed polarization to probe the @xmath2 .",
    "the above features are borne out in fig .  2 .",
    "in order to see which regions of @xmath77 are most sensitive to the new physics , we plot for left- and right - handed electron beams respectively , in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 4(a ) @xmath111 versus @xmath77 and in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 4(b ) the deviation from the sm result divided by the square root of the predicted cross section versus @xmath77 .",
    "we show results for @xmath143 gev with 100% @xmath105 beam polarization in these figures .",
    "first , we note the shape of @xmath111 in figs 3(a ) and 4(a ) . for left - handed electrons ,",
    "the bulk of the cross section comes from the low @xmath77 region ; the reduction at very low @xmath77 is due to the @xmath131 cut and the sharp peak at @xmath144 gev is due to the radiative return to the @xmath24 pole . for 100% right polarized electrons ,",
    "the cross section is rather flat in the low to moderate @xmath77 region , then increases as a result of the @xmath24 peak at high @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the right - handed cross section is two orders of magnitude smaller than the left - handed cross section away from the @xmath24 peak , any realistic degree of polarization ( i.e.  90% ) will lead to a large contribution from @xmath136 to the low @xmath77 region .",
    "in general , there can also be a peak due to a @xmath1 for @xmath145 which occurs at @xmath146 in analogy with the sm @xmath24 .",
    "most important , however , is the relative statistical significance , shown in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 4(b ) . in both the left- and right - handed cases ,",
    "the low @xmath77 region is the most sensitive to the new physics .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , for left - handed electrons , the cross section is largest at low @xmath77 , as mentioned above .",
    "second , the lower @xmath77 , the higher the mass probed in the @xmath1 propagator via eq .",
    "( [ egamma ] ) .",
    "the relative effect is even larger when combining the @xmath147 s from the different bins , since it is the squares of the plotted quantities which will enter .",
    "overall , the kk model leads to the most statistically significant deviations , except for the 100% left polarized case where the ssm(@xmath2 ) exhibits the largest deviation .",
    "we can also see clearly how the sign of the deviation from the sm depends on the beam polarization . for the kk model and ssm(@xmath140 ) , we observe a negative deviation with right - handed polarization , implying a negative @xmath1 contribution , versus a positive overall contribution coming from the left - handed channel .",
    "clearly , interference effects will make probing @xmath2 s nontrivial .",
    "we shall return to this point in the next section .    in figs .",
    "5 and 6 we plot the analogous quantities relevant to @xmath112 , versus @xmath148 . we note that both @xmath112 and the relative statistical significance are peaked in the forward and backward directions and both are very nearly symmetric in @xmath148 .",
    "the latter implies that the forward - backward asymmetry will be small and , therefore , the deviation from the sm forward - backward asymmetry will also be small , at least in absolute magnitude .",
    "we therefore do not expect the forward - backward asymmetry to serve as a useful probe of the new physics , which is confirmed by explicit calculation .",
    "an important observation is that our @xmath131 cut , while eliminating a large background , has also eliminated much of our signal ( both from the small angle and soft events ) which was appreciably stronger prior to the cut . a more detailed study , including a detector simulation , would be required to determine whether the background could be accurately subtracted with a looser @xmath131 cut .",
    "the best discovery limits were in general obtained using the observable @xmath111 , combined with beam polarization , while @xmath112 was less sensitive .",
    "comparable or equal limits were obtained using the total cross section , with an additional cut on the energy to eliminate the @xmath24 pole radiative return events : @xmath149 as can be seen from figs .",
    "3(b ) and 4(b ) , the @xmath24 pole region is quite insensitive to new physics . in the cases that @xmath111 provided a better limit than the total cross section ,",
    "the improvement was of order 50 gev .",
    "however , the @xmath147 obtained using the total cross section is a somewhat less stable function of @xmath59 as the sign of the deviation from the sm cross section may change with @xmath59 leading to isolated regions of insensitivity at low @xmath59 . also , when systematic errors are included , the limits obtained using @xmath111 are affected much less than those obtained using the total cross section .",
    "substantially weaker limits were obtained using the left - right asymmetry , @xmath150 even when including systematic errors only one half those used in the @xmath111 calculation ( since one expects some cancellation of errors between the numerator and denominator in @xmath151 ) . as expected from the discussion of the previous section , the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath152 , was quite insensitive to the new physics . in light of the above , we restrict the remaining discussion to limits obtained using @xmath111 as an observable .    in obtaining the @xmath147 for @xmath111 , we used 10 equal sized energy bins in the range @xmath153 , where @xmath154 follows from the @xmath131 cut eq .",
    "( [ ptcut ] ) : @xmath155 which supersedes the acceptance cut of eq .",
    "( [ accept ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the error on the measurement and analogous formulae hold for other observables .",
    "one sided 95% confidence level discovery limits are obtained by requiring @xmath158 for discovery .",
    "systematic errors , when included , were added in quadrature with the statistical errors .    in determining the limits for the case of polarized electron beams , we show results for the polarization state which in general has the largest sensitivity ( deviation from the sm ) for a given model ; a right - handed @xmath105 beam for the lrm and a left - handed beam for all other models .",
    "we used one half the unpolarized luminosity for the polarized case , assuming equal running time in each polarization state .",
    "the discovery limits for all five models are listed in table i , for @xmath159 , 1.0 and 1.5 tev , using the same input parameters as for the cross sections presented in the previous section .",
    "we show limits for both an unpolarized @xmath105 beam and for a 90% polarized one . for each center - of - mass energy ,",
    "two luminosity scenarios are considered and we present limits obtained with and without systematic errors .",
    "our prescription is to include a 2% systematic error per bin .",
    "this number is quite arbitrary but seems reasonable , if not conservative , considering the clean final state .",
    "in addition to detector systematics , which we expect will dominate , there are uncertainties associated with the beam luminosity and energy , which will be spread over a range .",
    "the systematic errors associated with the background subtraction should be much smaller than 2% as should be the errors in the calculation of the qed corrections .",
    "the 2% number should not be taken too seriously therefore , except to highlight the fact that a precision measurement is required to take full advantage of the large event rate .",
    "certain features are common to all models . with",
    "no systematic error included , we observe quite an improvement in the limits with increased luminosity .",
    "the only exception is the uum at @xmath22 of 1.5 tev , where the improvement is minimal .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath147 decreases very rapidly as @xmath59 is increased in the vicinity of the limit , hence increasing the luminosity by a factor of 2.5 does little .",
    "the unusual @xmath22 dependence can be attributed to the interference effect noted in the previous section , which results in , for example , for the uum with @xmath139 and an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath13 , a lower discovery limit at @xmath160 tev than at 0.5 and 1 tev .",
    "we will return to this peculiar behaviour later in the section .",
    "when 2% systematic errors are included , the high luminosity scenario yields little improvement in the limits in any of the models , since the systematic error now dominates the statistical .",
    "perhaps surprising at first is the observation that 90% beam polarization does not improve the limits very much .",
    "this follows from taking into account the reduced luminosity and the fact that the left - handed component tends to dominate the unpolarized cross section by a considerable amount . on the other hand",
    ", we observed that if the polarization is pushed beyond 90% , then the right - polarized limits can increase significantly in those models in which the beyond - sm bosons have a non - zero right - handed coupling : the lrm , kk model and ssm(@xmath140 ) . in the latter two models",
    ", it is however , the @xmath1 which is being probed . the higher degree of polarization is required to eliminate the contamination from the much larger left - handed component .",
    "thus , the primary advantage of beam polarization is to distinguish between models and measure the new couplings , as will be investigated in the next section .",
    "7 presents the @xmath2 mass discovery limits obtainable in the lrm with an unpolarized beam , plotted versus @xmath38 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 @xmath163 , 1.0 , 1.5 and 2 tev using a luminosity of 50 fb@xmath13 for @xmath159 tev and 200 fb@xmath13 for the higher energies .",
    "only statistical errors are included .",
    "depending on @xmath22 and @xmath38 , the limits range from 0.8 to 2.8 tev .",
    "we expect greater deviations from the sm , and hence larger limits , as @xmath38 is increased since this increases the @xmath2 coupling strength , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ lrmlagr ] ) . the predicted dependence on @xmath38",
    "is generally observed , except at low @xmath38 where we notice a moderate _",
    "increase _ in the limits , even though the @xmath2 couplings have weakened .",
    "we attribute this effect to the @xmath1 , whose couplings are enhanced ( but its mass increased ) in the low @xmath38 region .",
    "this was indicated by an appreciable improvement in the limits for low @xmath38 and @xmath161 versus those obtained using @xmath164 and consequently a heavier @xmath1 , via eq .",
    "( [ massrel ] ) .",
    "8 demonstrates the improvement in bounds in the moderate to large @xmath38 region obtained when a 90% or 100% polarized right - handed @xmath105 beam is used .",
    "the beam polarization picks out the lrm @xmath2 and suppresses the sm @xmath26 .",
    "8(a ) shows that for @xmath165 , 90% beam polarization improves the limits . further increasing the polarization leads to substantial improvements , even at lower @xmath38 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "8(b ) .    the dependence of the limits in the uum on @xmath166 is shown in fig .",
    "9 , for @xmath162 @xmath163 , 1.0 , 1.5 and 2.0 tev , under the same running conditions as fig .",
    "7 . only the unpolarized case is considered as beam polarization was not beneficial .",
    "again , only statistical errors are included . at each @xmath22 , we note that the contour defining the exclusion region as a function of @xmath166 is a complicated curve .",
    "the consequence is that for @xmath167 tev , we obtain better limits over a range of @xmath166 than we do for @xmath160 and even @xmath168 tev .",
    "essentially , this is due to the complicated interference with the sm diagrams . in general , as @xmath166 increases , the uum couplings also increase , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ uumlagr ] ) , so that higher mass scales are probed .",
    "so , referring to fig .",
    "2 , the peak in the cross section ( due to the @xmath1 ) at the scale being probed shifts to the right .",
    "but the sign of the deviation from the sm changes with @xmath22 for fixed @xmath59 ( or vice - versa ) such that the uum cross section dips below the sm over some region to the left of the peak , then goes back above it for small @xmath22 ( or large @xmath169 for fixed @xmath22 ) .",
    "hence , there is a small step in the limits near @xmath170 , corresponding to passing the rightmost crossing with the sm and another structure in the contour at some higher @xmath59 such that the leftmost crossing is situated near @xmath22 .",
    "one sees this explicitly by plotting @xmath147 versus @xmath59 for fixed @xmath22 and @xmath166 and observing a dip in the @xmath147 at relatively low @xmath59 .",
    "had we used @xmath135 as an observable , the dip would be much more pronounced since @xmath171 passes through zero , but @xmath172 may differ in sign between bins , leading to a nonzero @xmath147 at the crossing points .",
    "once @xmath166 is large enough that we are probing the region to the left of the leftmost crossing , the limits shoot up in an impressive fashion as the dip in @xmath147 never goes back down to 2.69 .",
    "the shape of the plot is luminosity dependent since , as pointed out earlier in this section , the degree to which increased luminosity improves the limits depends on the rate at which the @xmath147 decreases with increasing @xmath59 in the vicinity of the limit .",
    "that , in turn , varies with @xmath22 for fixed @xmath166 and with @xmath166 for fixed @xmath22 .      in this section",
    ", we consider constraints which can be put on the couplings of extra gauge bosons by the process @xmath173 .",
    "these constraints are significant only in the case where the mass of the corresponding extra gauge boson is considerably lower than its search limit in this process . in most models ,",
    "the process @xmath174 and/or searches at the lhc are more sensitive to a @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( lhc ) than the process @xmath173 .",
    "we assume here that a signal for an extra gauge boson has been detected by another experiment .",
    "given such a signal , we derive constraints ( at 95% c.l . ) on the couplings of extra gauge bosons .",
    "we present the constraints in terms of couplings normalized as follows relative to eqs .",
    "( [ zcoup ] ) and ( [ wcoup ] ) .",
    "@xmath175    the constraints correspond to @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the prediction for the observable @xmath178 in the sm , @xmath179 is the prediction of the extension of the sm and @xmath180 is the expected experimental error .",
    "the index @xmath181 corresponds to different observables such as @xmath135 and @xmath151 .",
    "our assumptions concerning beam polarization are as follows . for single beam ( @xmath105 ) polarization , we assume , as in the previous section , equal running in left and right polarization states . for double beam polarization , we assume equal running in the @xmath182 and @xmath183 states , but no running in the @xmath184 and @xmath185 states .",
    "thus , @xmath186 where the first subscript of @xmath135 refers to the @xmath105 helicity .",
    "note that for 100% polarized @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath187 in all the models we consider .",
    "this remains approximately valid as the couplings deviate from their model - defined values .    in figs .",
    "[ nnng1 ] and [ nnng2 ] , we present @xmath30 coupling constraints assuming there is no signal for a @xmath2 .",
    "this is the case when the sm is extended by @xmath188 factors only .",
    "it can also happen in models where the @xmath2 has purely right - handed couplings and the right - handed neutrino is heavy .",
    "then , the process @xmath173 would be one of the best for constraining the couplings of the @xmath1 to sm neutrinos _ below _ the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "if there is also a signal for a @xmath2 , a similar analysis could be performed including the @xmath2 parameters , as measured in other experiments .",
    "the resulting bounds would be larger than those shown in the two figures .",
    "however , the main points of the discussion would remain unchanged .",
    "[ nnng1 ] illustrates the resulting constraints on a 1.5 tev @xmath1 at a 500 gev collider for different observables and experimental parameters , including luminosity and beam polarization .",
    "we see that we can get some interesting constraints even though the @xmath1 is considerably heavier than the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the region which can not be resolved by the observables is between the two corresponding lines and contains the couplings of the sm .",
    "hence the star in this figure corresponds to the ssm(@xmath1 ) .",
    "for the cases where only one bounding line is shown , the second line is outside the figure . @xmath189 and",
    "@xmath190 are mainly constrained by the interference of the @xmath1 exchange with the sm .",
    "the strongest constraint is on the @xmath1 coupling to left - handed neutrinos .",
    "this makes the constraints especially simple .",
    "first we consider an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath13 .",
    "the total unpolarized cross section gives the strongest constraint .",
    "the constraints from energy and angular distributions ( with 10 equal size bins ) were also considered but they give no improvement . the constraint from @xmath151 is shown for two polarization cases : 90% electron beam polarization and the case of a collider with a @xmath191 polarized electron beam and a @xmath192 polarized positron beam . even for the latter case , the constraint from @xmath151 is worse than that from the total cross section .",
    "we mention here for completeness that two polarized beams give not only a high effective polarization but also a small effective polarization error @xcite .    the constraint obtained with an integrated luminosity of @xmath193 fb@xmath13 is also shown in fig .",
    "[ nnng1 ] , to contrast with the high luminosity case .",
    "we see that for @xmath194 fb@xmath13 a systematic error of 1% relaxes the constraints considerably and dilutes the advantage of high luminosity .",
    "thus , both small systematic errors and a high luminosity collider are highly desired for the proposed measurement .    fig",
    ".  [ nnng2 ] shows the possible constraints on @xmath189 and @xmath190 from @xmath135 and @xmath151 , including systematic errors , for two representative @xmath1 masses , 0.75 tev and 1 tev .",
    "the constraints become much stronger as the @xmath1 mass is decreased .",
    "so far , we assumed that the @xmath195 couplings , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , are precisely known .",

    "4(b ) of @xcite illustrates such a measurement for a collider with a luminosity of 20 fb@xmath13 .",

    "[ nnng3 ] to [ nnng6 ] , we shall assume that there is no signal from a @xmath1 but that a signal from a @xmath2 has been observed .",

    "we recognize that this particular scenario is unlikely in the context of the models we consider .",
    "for instance , in the uum , the @xmath2 and @xmath1 masses are approximately equal and there would most likely be a signal observed for the @xmath1 in addition to the @xmath2 .",
    "the situation is similar in the lrm , where the relationship between the @xmath2 and @xmath1 masses is given in eq .",
