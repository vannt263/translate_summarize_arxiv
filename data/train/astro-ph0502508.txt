    "this paper is part of our general program of observations of galactic open clusters ( the bologna open clusters chemical evolution project , or bocce , bragaglia & tosi 2004 , and in preparation ) . these aggregates , and in particular the old ones , represent an ideal tool to study the properties of the disc of our galaxy and their evolution with time ( e.g. janes 1979 ; panagia & tosi 1981 ; friel 1995 ) .",
    "open clusters with ages less than about 5 gyr are also good tests of the stellar evolutionary tracks , since they can be used to discriminate between models with or without overshooting , and on its supposed extension .",
    "in our well tested approach , we obtain the cluster colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) from deep and precise photometry , and derive at the same time age , distance , reddening and approximate metallicity using the synthetic cmd method ( tosi et al .",
    "we have already published our findings for 15 clusters ( see kalirai & tosi 2004 ; tosi et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "whenever possible , we also try to derive precise metal abundances with high resolution spectroscopy ( bragaglia et al .",
    "2001 ; carretta et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we present here the photometric results on the relatively unstudied open cluster berkeley 22 ( c0555 + 078 ) , with coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , l = @xmath5 , b = @xmath6 .",
    "the best colour magnitude diagram published so far for this object is by kaluzny ( 1994 , hereafter k94 ) .",
    "he observed a small region around the cluster centre ( covering with a mosaic of 5 pointings less than 4.5 arcmin by 6 arcmin , see fig .",
    "[ fig - map ] ) with the kpno 2.1 m telescope , in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 filters .",
    "he obtained quite deep cmds and derived a very small apparent radius for the cluster , of about 2 arcmin on the sky .",
    "kaluzny estimated age , reddening , and distance ( age @xmath10 3 gyr , = 0.65 , and distance from the sun = 6 kpc ) , assuming solar metallicity .",
    "this assumption was made for lack of any precise information on the true metal abundance , but he argued that the actual metallicity should be lower than solar , because of the morphology of the red giant clump ( in which case , reddening and distance estimates would increase ) .",
    "phelps , janes & montgomery ( 1994 , their fig .",
    "13 ) also observed this cluster , in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters . from their data , of quality inferior to k94",
    ", they estimate an age of 2.1 gyr , based on the mai ( morphological age indicator , i.e. the difference in magnitude between the ms turn - off and the red clump ) . in a companion paper janes & phelps ( 1994 ) give for this cluster e(b - v)=0.65 , as deduced from the mean colour of the red clump .",
    "salaris , weiss & percival ( 2004 ) , using a new calibration of the morphological age index , and adopting @xmath11v = 2.1 from friel ( 1995 ) and [ fe / h ] = @xmath12 from gratton ( 2000 ) , find for be 22 an age of 4.26 @xmath13 1.65 gyr .",
    "lata et al .",
    "( 2002 ) give integrated magnitude and colour for be 22 , based on published data : following their age - magnitude relation , an age of 1.1 gyr is derived , while the use of the age - colour relation produces an unreasonable value ( 28 gyr ) .",
    "the maps of dust infrared emission by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) indicate a reddening of = 0.65 , while dutra & bica ( 2000 ) find = 0.63 , in very good agreement .",
    "noriega - mendoza and ruelas - mayorga ( 1997 ) , applying a technique similar to the sarajedini ( 1994 ) method for simultaneous metallicity and reddening determination , find [ fe / h ] = @xmath14 and = 0.70 .",
    "the reddening seems in close agreement with the other literature values , even if tied to a metallicity different from k94 .",
    "finally , be 22 has recently been suggested to be part of the canis major cluster family ( frinchaboy et al .",
    "2004 , martin et al .",
    "2004 ) , as many other ocs .    in section 2",
    "we describe our data and the reduction process , in section 3 we present our cmds and compare them to literature ones , in section 4 we derive the cluster parameters , and a summary is given in section 5 .    10 arcmin@xmath15 , and is oriented with north up and east left .",

    "berkeley 22 was observed at three different telescopes .",
    "table 1 gives a log of the three runs and fig .",

    "the first data were obtained with the 1.54 m danish telescope located in la silla , chile , on 1995 march 6 , 8 , 10 .",
    "we used the direct camera with ccd no 28 ( tek 1024@xmath161024 , scale 0.377 arcsec pix@xmath17 , field of view 6.4 @xmath16 6.4 arcmin@xmath15 ) .",
    "we took only one field , centred on the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - map ] ) .",
    "exposures ranged from 300 to 1500 seconds in b , from 20 to 900 seconds in v and from 30 to 900 seconds in i. conditions were photometric , and seeing ranged between 0.9 and 1.4 arcsecarcsec .",
    "standard stars areas were observed , and later used to calibrate the whole set of data on the cluster .",
    "we later reobserved the cluster on 2000 october 2 and 3 with the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) on roque de los muchachos , mounting dolores ( device optimized for low resolution ) a focal reducer instrument equipped with a loral thinned , back - illuminated 2048@xmath162048 ccd , with scale 0.275 arcsec pix@xmath17 , and field of view of 9.4 @xmath16 9.4 arcmin@xmath15 .",
    "seeing conditions were not ideal for this rather crowded cluster , and we had some technical problems , which plagued chiefly the long exposures on the central field .",
    "we decided to retain for further analysis only the data obtained for the external comparison field , located 30 arcmin south of the cluster centre , and calibrated independently using standard areas observed during the run .",
    "finally , deep exposures ( b : 3 @xmath16 600 sec ; v : 2 @xmath16 300 sec , i : 2 @xmath16 300 sec ) on the central field were obtained with the superb seeing imager 2 ( susi2 ) on the new technology telescope ( ntt ) , on 2000 december 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - map ] ) .",
    "the two eev ccds cover a field of view of 5.4 @xmath16 5.4 arcmin@xmath15 , and a gap of about 8 arcsec is present between the two chips ; we binned the chips 2@xmath162 , yielding a scale of 0.16 arcsec pix@xmath17 . seeing",

    "they are retained in ( or excluded from ) the synthetic cmd according to the completeness factors listed in table [ tabcompl ] .",
    "all the synthetic cmds have been computed either assuming that all the cluster stars are single objects or that a fraction of them are members of binary systems with random mass ratio .",
    "we find , as in many other clusters , that a binary fraction around 30% well reproduces the observed distribution along the main sequence .",
    "all the synthetic cmds shown in the figures assume this fraction of binaries .",
    "these models reproduce well also the observed colour distribution , thus suggesting that differential reddening does not affect the examined regions of the cluster .        to our knowledge",
    ", no studies have been performed on the cluster membership . to reduce the field contamination , without limiting excessively the number of measured stars , we have used as reference for the simulations the @xmath18 cmd of the cluster region within a radius of 2 arcmin from the centre .",
    "this central region contains 744 stars with measured @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes .",
    "the corresponding cmd is shown in fig .",
    "[ sim](a ) .",
    "since an equivalent area of the external field contains 131 stars , we can assume that the cluster members in the central region are presumably 613 .",
    "the synthetic cmds have therefore been created with this number of objects . to compare the resulting cmds and lfs with the empirical ones , we have added to the 613 theoretical stars the 131 objects measured in the external field , which would nt be reproduceable by the models .    due to the very red colour of be22 , and in spite of the depth of the b frames , only 600 of the 744 central stars have also a measured @xmath7 magnitude",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ sim ] b ) .",
    "we used the synthetic @xmath19 cmds to check the colours and the morphology of the various evolutionary sequences .",
    "we find that with all the adopted sets of stellar tracks only the solar metallicity models are able to reproduce both in @xmath20 and in @xmath21 the colours of the observed cmd sequences .",
    "all the other metallicities lead to extended sgbs and excessively red rgbs ( once fitting the ms colours ) , or wrong slopes of the ms , or non self - consistent @xmath20 and @xmath21 ms colours .    the synthetic cmds in better agreement with the data for each of the three types of models",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ sim ] , where the @xmath18 diagrams of panels c , d and e show the 613 synthetic stars plus the 131 ones of the external field . in the @xmath19 cmds of panels",
    "f , g and h only the synthetic stars with magnitude compatible with the measured b magnitudes are plotted .",
    "all the synthetic cmds seem to underpredict the colour extension of the clump , but the lack of information on the actual cluster membership of the objects observed in that cmd region prevents any firm conclusion on this point .    to appreciate the quality of the agreement between the synthetic and the observational diagrams of fig .",
    "[ sim ] , we have divided the cmds in cells and compared the number of synthetic ( @xmath22 ) and observed ( @xmath23 ) stars counted in each cell .",
    "[ simobsratio ] displays the ratio @xmath24 , if @xmath25 , or @xmath26 , if @xmath27 with a logarithmic grey - scale coding .",
    "the cell size is 0.5 mag in @xmath8 and 0.2 mag in @xmath18 .",
    "the grey level is lightest for @xmath24=1 and becomes increasingly dark for increasing difference in either direction of synthetic and observed counts . to keep memory of the actual @xmath24",
    ", a plus sign is indicated in all cells where @xmath28 and a minus sign in those where @xmath29 .",
    "cells with no grey filling have no observed stars when a plus is plotted , and have no synthetic stars when a minus is plotted .",
    "the lfs of the best cases for the bbc , fra and fst models are shown in fig .  [ simlf ] ( lines ) and compared to that of the cmd of fig .  [ sim](a ) .",
    "the bbc solar models reproduce quite well the shape and colours of the observed evolutionary sequences , but only for @xmath1=2.4 gyr [ fig .",
    "[ sim](c ) and ( f ) ] they predict not only the right luminosity but also the right number of clump and rgb stars . the lf ( top panel in fig .  [ simlf ] ) is in excellent agreement with the data as well . at lower metallicity",
    "the bbc models provide more extended sgbs ( hence , redder rgbs ) and turn - off hooks , that make their synthetic cmds less satisfactory than the solar metallicity ones .",
    "the fst solar models also reproduce well the data , if the intermediate overshooting case @xmath30 is chosen .",
    "the luminosity and the number of stars of the clump are consistent with the data for whatever age between 2.3 and 2.7 gyr , but only for @xmath1=2.5 gyr is the to shape in excellent agreement with the observational one [ fig .",
    "[ sim](e ) and ( h ) ] . as apparent from the lf of the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ simlf ] , the relative number of stars in the different evolutionary phases is slightly less correct than that of the bbc best case , but still very good . on the other hand ,",
    "these tracks reproduce the observed rgb colour ( both in @xmath20 and in @xmath21 better than the others . if the higher overshooting , @xmath31 , models are adopted , the clump is always less populated and the to tends to come out excessively hooked , independently of the age . at lower metallicity ,",
    "the fst models predict ms slopes deviating from the observed one , specially in the @xmath19 cmd .",
    "the fra solar models allow for the best clump reproduction , but have pronounced to hook and tend to populate the whole rgb , contrary to what is observed .",
    "the best compromise is obtained with @xmath1=2.0 or 2.1 gyr and , respectively , = 14.1 or 14.0 , with the same = 0.65 [ fig .",
    "[ sim](d ) and ( g ) ] . at lower metallicity",
    "the to shape worsens , the ms curvature diminishes and the rgb is overpopulated and too red .",
    "the results obtained with the various sets of models are quite consistent with each other , once the known differences in the input physics are taken into account .",
    "in fact , we obtain the youngest best fitting age @xmath1 ( 2.0 or 2.1 gyr ) with the fra models , without overshooting , the oldest one ( 2.7 gyr ) with the fst@xmath32 ones with maximum overshooting , and intermediate values with the sets with intermediate overshooting ( 2.4 gyr with the bbc models and 2.5 with the fst@xmath33 models ) . the reddening is derived with a very small uncertainty ( only @xmath13 0.005 ) , and the distance modulus   with an uncertainty of @xmath13 0.15 .",
    "if we consider only the two best fitting models ( bbc and fst@xmath33 ) , the agreement is even more striking , with @xmath1=2.4 and 2.5 gyr , = 0.64 and 0.65 , and = 13.8 and 13.9 , respectively .",
    "the application of the synthetic cmd method to be 22 has allowed us to derive very narrow ranges for the values of its age , distance and reddening .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty related to the adoption of different stellar models is significant only on the age , where it inevitably reflects the different overshooting assumptions . even allowing for a less selective choice of the best cases ,",
    "the reddening always turns out between 0.64 and 0.65 , in excellent agreement with the derivations by k94 , janes & phelps ( 1994 ) , and the maps by schlegel et al .",
    "higher reddenings , of course , are inferred if a metallicity lower than solar is adopted .",
    "the bbc models with z=0.008 , the fra models with z=0.01 and the fst ones with z=0.006 all need = 0.70 , the value suggested by noriega - mendoza & ruelas - mayorga ( 1997 ) , but none of them reproduces the observed features as well as the solar tracks .",
    "we thus favour a solar metallicity for this cluster , despite the existing suggestions for lower abundances .",
    "in fact this cluster could be an important piece in the puzzle regarding the abundance distribution with galactocentric distance : while almost anyone thinks in term of a radial gradient , twarog , ashman & anthony - twarog ( 1997 ) and more recently corder & twarog ( 2001 ) presented the case for a step distribution , with clusters closer than 10 kpc from the centre having metallicities different from those of more external objects .",
    "be 22 is farther than 10 kpc , and from our study appears to have solar abundance ; if that is confirmed , it would represent a flaw in twarog et al.s ( 1997 ) reasoning .",
    "however , none of the presently available metallicity derivations resides on firm grounds , and we believe that high - resolution spectroscopy is needed for a safe estimate .    as discussed in the previous section , the distance modulus formally ranges between 13.8 and 14.1 , but the very best models indicate = @xmath34 , corresponding to a distance from the sun of @xmath35 kpc and from the galactic centre of @xmath36 kpc .",
    "this places be 22 among the outermost old open clusters , second in our bocce sample only to be 29 , which is however much farther out , at @xmath37 kpc ( tosi et al .",
    "2004 , carraro et al .",
    "2004 ) from the centre .",
    "although affected by a substantial reddening , be 22 does not show evidence for differential effects .",
    "the cmds of different cluster regions do not present colour shifts , and the synthetic diagrams have the same colour spread of the empirical ones by simply adopting the photometric errors .",
    "evaporation of low mass stars does not appear to have significantly affected be 22 , contrary to what happens to many open clusters .",
    "the synthetic luminosity functions match very well the observational ones both in the inner regions and in the whole surveyed field .",
    "since all the stars born in the cluster , and still alive at the present epoch , which passed the incompleteness tests , are counted in the synthetic lf , this good match indicates that , within the uncertainties , only a minor fraction of the objects born in the examined area can have moved away during the cluster lifetime .",
    "yet , the comparison of the cmd of our external field with those of the cluster field and of the besanon galactic models suggests that ms stars like those of be22 and not expected from the models are found also at 30 arcmin from the cluster centre , corresponding , at our derived distance to 52 pc .",
    "is this just a coincidence , or has be 22 really been able to form stars over such a large area ?",
    "be 22 has been suggested to belong to the family of the debris of the newly discovered canis major satellite ( frinchaboy et al .",
    "2004 , martin et al .",
    "2004 ) , and we have made a direct comparison to it ( fig .",
    "[ fig - model ] ) , finding be 22 redder than cma , once considered the different absorptions .",
    "our fields of view are probably too small to address this issue , but the circumstance that neither the cmd of the cluster nor that of our external field appear to contain alien contaminating structures , when compared with the predictions of the besanon galactic model , suggests that be 22 is out of significant streams or overdensity regions .",
    "interestingly enough , we found the same lack of evidence for be 29 , which was also suggested by frinchaboy et al . to be connected to canis major .",
    "admittedly , lack of evidence is not evidence of lack .",
    "this paper is based on observations collected at the european southern observatory , chile , and at the italian telescopio nazionale galileo .",
    "most of l.d.f.s work was done while at the osservatorio astronomico di bologna .",
    "we warmly thank p. montegriffo , whose programs were used in the data analysis , m. bellazzini for interesting discussions and for providing the canis major data , p. ventura , who kindly provided the unpublished fst models , and l. angeretti for help with the comparison procedures . we appreciated the constructive comments of the anonymous referee .",
    "the bulk of the numerical code for cmd simulations was originally written by l. greggio .",
    "we acknowledge the use of the valuable bda database , maintained by j.c .",
