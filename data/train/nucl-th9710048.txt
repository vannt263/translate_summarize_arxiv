    "the successes of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) between quarks as the fundamental theory of strong interactions have led people to expect new hadronic states often dominated by exotic fock - space components @xcite . in nuclear physics ,",
    "one is particularly interested in new nonstrange dibaryons ( with baryon number @xmath9 ) of unusually low mass and narrow width that might betray their underlying quark structures .",
    "no such dibaryon has been unambiguously identified experimentally despite years of search @xcite .",
    "there are two promising dibaryon candidates , one with unusually high mass and one with unusually low mass .",
    "the high - mass candidate is an isospin 1 structure of width not exceeding 80 mev first seen experimentally in the helicity difference @xmath10 of the total @xmath11 cross section at an energy that corresponds to a dibaryon mass of 2735 mev @xcite .",
    "it has been seen more recently at the same mass in the @xmath11 spin correlation parameter @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this structure has been interpreted by lomon and collaborators @xcite as a six - quark `` small - bag '' state with the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) quantum number of @xmath14 .",
    "the interpretation uses the r - matrix formalism to determine if the matching of an internal quark description based on qcd to an external nucleon description based on meson - exchange dynamics at a boundary radius separating the two regions could be made in a way consistent with the empirical @xmath13 phase parameters in the neighborhood of the observed structure .",
    "( for an assumed quark model of internal wavefunctions , the resonance energy can be predicted by varying the matching radius @xmath15 until the external @xmath13 wavefunction vanishes at @xmath15 at precisely the same c.m .",
    "energy as the internal bag - state energy . )",
    "the r - matrix analysis also yields a resonance width of about 50 mev , in rough agreement with experiment",
    ". this interpretation will require confirmation by phase - shift analysis or by direct detection via resonance production in nuclear reactions .",
    "in the r - matrix analysis , the experimentally observed mass ( 2735 mev ) has been found @xcite to be consistent with the bag parameters used in the `` cloudy - bag '' model of @xcite , provided that the pion cloud is neglected . furthermore , because of its coupling to the external @xmath13 channel , the internal bag state is not in equilibrium , and therefore the resonance mass is higher than the equilibrium bag mass of 2680 mev @xcite .",
    "if the external pion cloud had been present , as in the actual cloudy - bag model @xcite , the equilibrium mass ( at 2380 mev ) would have been much lower @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that the role of the pion cloud external to the bag needs clarification .",
    "the r - matrix analyses have shown that @xmath13 phase parameters are also consistent with many other `` high - mass '' nonstrange dibaryons @xcite , such as those predicted by nonrelativistic potential models with pairwise color confinement @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the case for these high - mass dibaryons can be significantly strengthened if experimental effects are observed for at least another of these dibaryons .",
    "experimental structures seen in @xmath10 at 2900 mev @xcite and in @xmath16 at 2630 mev @xcite could be candidates for a @xmath17 and a @xmath18 dibaryon , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition , suggestions have been made that these nonstrange dibaryons might appear at much lower masses instead .",
    "one with a proposed mass 2065 mev and width @xmath19 mev might be responsible for a narrow structure in the energy dependence of the experimental excitation function [ at @xmath20 in the center of mass ( c.m . ) ] of the pionic double charge exchange ( dcx ) reaction @xmath21 on nuclear neutrons at @xmath22 mev @xcite .",
    "this explanation seems to be supported by observations of a narrow structure at 2060 mev with a width @xmath23 mev at itep @xcite and at celsius @xcite .",
    "the associated dibaryon , usually called @xmath24 , has the proposed quantum numbers @xmath25 , making it inaccessible from @xmath13 channels and copnsequently narrow .",
    "however , an alternative explanation of the dcx phenomenon that requires no dibaryon has also been given @xcite .",
    "the dibaryon interpretation finds theoretical support in bag models of dibaryon masses where this particular dibaryon appears at 2100 mev@xcite or 2000 mev @xcite . the theoretical bag state involved is a p - wave excitation in the @xmath26 separation with the cluster quantum numbers of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however , in quark potential models with pairwise color confinement , the state appears much higher , at around 2700 mev @xcite .",
    "the mass can be reduced considerably with configuration mixing , but it seems difficult to reduce it to below 2400 mev if one uses quark - quark ( @xmath29 ) dynamics deduced from single - baryon resonances @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with a second nonstrange isoscalar dibaryon called @xmath1 which has the quantum numbers @xmath0 , is accessible from @xmath30 channels , and whose baryon - baryon component is made up of @xmath31 .",
    "we shall call this @xmath1 a didelta when we want to emphasize this @xmath31 component .",
    "the theoretical @xmath1 mass @xmath32 again covers a wide range : it is highest in the small - bag based r - matrix analysis which yields a value of 2840 mev @xcite , well above the @xmath33 threshold at 2460 mev .",
    "it is lowest in the quark delocalization and color screening ( qdcs ) model , where it appears at around 2100 mev @xcite , just above the @xmath34 threshold at 2020 mev . near the lower limit of this mass range ,",
    "the @xmath34 phase space is small so that the decay of @xmath1 is probably dominated there by the @xmath13 channel , where the nucleons fall apart in a relative d - state .",
    "however , the @xmath35 widths could dominate as @xmath32 increases .",
    "a search for the @xmath1 dibaryon is interesting for the following reasons : in most quark models , the @xmath36 mass difference comes from the color - magnetic term of the one - gluon interaction between pairs of quarks .",
    "the total pairwise color - magnetic operator has the same ( repulsive ) matrix element in @xmath1 as in two well separated @xmath2 s if the former s orbital wavefunction is totally symmetric in the quark labels @xcite . in the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) bag model @xcite",
    ", the @xmath1 mass then falls below the @xmath37 threshold by 120 mev because the spatial integral associated with the interaction is inversely proportional to the bag radius @xmath38 , and this radius increases from @xmath2 to @xmath1 by virtue of the increasing total kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "( the radius of the @xmath39-baryon bag of baryon number @xmath39 is roughly proportional to @xmath40 in the mit bag model . )",
    "the situation is different if quark confinement comes from a pairwise @xmath29 interaction that rises to infinity at infinite separation .",
    "the increasing size of an @xmath39-baryon containing @xmath41 quarks causes its confinement energy to increase so much that the @xmath1 mass moves substantially above the @xmath37 threshold instead @xcite .",
    "this result has been confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the qdcs model is able to reduce the @xmath1 mass substantially with the help of two additional assumptions : quark delocalization ( qd ) and color screening ( cs ) @xcite .",
    "qd takes advantage of the fact that the kinetic energy of a single quark state could be reduced if it is partly on the left side and partly on the right side of the system . for a gaussian spatial wavefunction , a maximum reduction of the kinetic energy of about 19% appears when there is a 50/50 left / right separation with the two wavefunction centers separated by 2.3 oscillator lengths , like two peas in a pod . for a dibaryon built up of a product of six such delocalized quark wavefunctions ,",
    "about 72% of the system is in the cluster configurations of the type @xmath26 and @xmath42 where the reduction in the kinetic energy can be realized .",
    "if one reduces the total kinetic energy in the mit bag by the resulting 14% ( 72% of 19% ) , one gets a @xmath1 mass of about 2090 mev instead of the usual 2340 mev , assuming that the interaction and confinement energies retain their spherical forms .",
    "however , in color confinement models or even in string models , this qd reduction of the kinetic energy alone can not overcome the strong increase in pairwise color confinement energy with increasing @xmath29 separations and with increasing baryon number @xmath39 .",
    "color screening now comes into play by assuming that the rising repulsion of the confinement potential at large distances @xcite does not exceed a finite upper bound @xcite .",
    "now finally qd could become energetically favorable in @xmath39-baryons .",
    "( the model of @xcite achieves the same result by measuring the confinement energy from the nearer baryon center , thus avoiding large @xmath29 separations . )",
    "the qd phenomenon could presumably be restricted to the interior of a bag . however",
    ", if realized between well - separated baryons @xcite , the idea has far - reaching implications . with quark delocalization taking place at all densities",
    ", the transition to the quark - gluon plasma will be at best a second - order phase transition .",
    "this seems to imply that if such an extreme picture is correct , attempts to search for quark - gluon plasmas might be doomed to failure , given the difficulty of detecting unambigous signals from even a first - order phase transition .",
    "however , a counter - argument is provided by the recent observation of unusually strong absorption of @xmath43 mesons in pb - pb collisions @xcite .",
    "one interpretation @xcite is that this is a signal for the color deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "consequently , it would be interesting to look for experimental indications for or against the qdcs model . this can not be done by studying nuclear forces , which can already be understood in terms of meson exchanges .",
    "in contrast , the observation of a low @xmath1 mass could be taken as a signal for qd in @xmath39-baryons .    in this connection , it is worth noting that a recent r - matrix analysis of available @xmath13 phase shifts below the dibaryon mass of 2240 mev finds no sign of a @xmath1 resonance in the @xmath30 channels with a width greater than 1 mev @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis does not exclude a narrower @xmath1 at a mass in between the energies of known phase shifts .",
    "in any case , progress in our understanding of dibaryons will require new experimental inputs .",
    "in particular , any new information on whether the @xmath1 mass might be high or low is likely to have important implications on the dynamics of quark confinement in baryons .",
    "the dibaryon @xmath1 could be produced by the inelastic scattering of projectiles from nuclear targets .",
    "the understanding of past failures to find it @xcite and the justification for future searches in such reactions would require some theoretical input concerning its production and decay properties .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to explore how its production cross section in @xmath44 inelastic scattering and its partial decay width into two nucleons could be calculated using standard techniques in nuclear reactions and a simple model of the @xmath1 as a didelta object .",
    "some of the issues which must be resolved before realistic results can be obtained are briefly discussed .",
    "in our treatment of the inelastic production , the deuteron is described by an s - state wave function made up of a sum of three gaussians fitted to the bonn c s - state wave function @xcite renormalized back to 100% .",
    "the d * is taken to be a pure @xmath31 gaussian wave function with an average @xmath37 separation of @xmath46 fm @xcite . the quark wave function in each baryon is assumed to be the same in both @xmath47 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the quarks in each baryon are localized to the left or right @xmath2 in @xmath1 , with no left - right antisymmetrization or delocalization @xcite yet included . later in the paper",
    ", we shall estimate qualitatively the effects of delocalization in the calculated quantities .",
    "the excitation of @xmath48 to @xmath49 requires an isoscalar transfer of 2 units of angular momentum . in the usual models of nuclear forces containing the exchanges of only pseudoscalar , scalar and vector mesons",
    ", @xmath1 can only be reached in the lowest order by a spin - isospin flip in each of the two target nucleons .",
    "each spin - isospin flip is caused by the exchange of an isovector meson such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 between the projectile and the target nucleon .",
    "it will turn out that the unpolarized cross section has important contributions from that part of the @xmath13 @xmath5-matrix proportional to the operator @xmath50 .    the spin - averaged differential cross section in the c.m .",

    "frame of the reaction .",
    "each scattering changes a target nucleon into a @xmath2 .",
    "the integral involves two momentum transfers    @xmath55    and an inelastic formfactor @xmath56 .",
    "the actual expression is considerably more complicated than the symbolic structure shown in eq .",

    "( [ eq : fds ] ) contains the glauber pair factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 for the number of distinct quark pairs on the target side , with one quark from each of the two target baryons .",
    "the effective projectile pair number @xmath59 is made up of a contribution of 3 from three projectile quarks each interacting twice with the target , and a contribution from three pairs of projectile quarks of    @xmath60    the formfactors from the projectile quarks are different for these two cases , being both different from those for two single scatterings from two separate baryons .",
    "the difference is described by an extra projectile formfactor @xmath61 above and beyond those for two separate elastic @xmath13 scatterings .",
    "its functional form will be given later .",
    "there are quark - quark operators hidden in the quark - quark scattering amplitudes @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fds ] ) .",
    "they are treated by first expressing @xmath13 scattering amplitudes in quarks coordinates @xcite . after the calculation of various operator matrix elements ,",
    "the scattering amplitudes are re - constructed back to @xmath13 form .",
    "the momentum @xmath63 is the @xmath13 relative momentum in the @xmath13 c.m .",
    "frame . for elastic scattering , or in the high - energy limit where the inelasticity is negligibly small , it is sufficient to use the elastic scattering value @xmath64 .",
    "we recognize that in inelastic scattering at lower energies , the effect of the smaller projectile momentum @xmath65 in the final state should be taken into consideration , in order to describe more accurately the energy dependence of both kinematics and dynamics .",
    "one possibility is to use the geometrical mean momentum @xmath66 , but this can not be correct because it gives the wrong behavior at threshold . of course , the glauber multiple - diffraction formalism is a high - energy approximation that should not be used too close to a reaction threshold , but it is conceptually also important to ensure that the invariant amplitude @xmath67 does not have a spurious singularity at threshold .",
    "the threshold behavior is not just a question of kinematics , because the elementary amplitude @xmath68 is also involved .",
    "now the inelastic production of @xmath1 involves at least two collisions . at each collision",
    ", the energy transfer can have a range of values .",
    "this suggests that the correct description might require an average over some distribution .",
    "we shall use the simplest realization of this concept , namely the assumption that the @xmath13 dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fds ] ) should be that for the arithmetical average of the proton energies in the initial and final states :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the mass transfer in the inelastic scattering .",

    "the dynamical factors @xmath72 inside the glauber double - scattering integral is approximately frame invariant , because in the usual parametrization using the optical theorem , it depends primarily on the total @xmath13 cross section @xmath73 if nucleons were the elementary objects of the glauber method .",
    "the reduction of @xmath13 amplitudes involving the operator @xmath50 to quark - quark amplitudes is made in a number of steps :    \\(a ) we first use the well - known relation @xcite @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "\\(b ) the @xmath29 operators are simplified by using the identities    @xmath76    @xmath77    only the tensor - force terms involving @xmath78 for two target quarks 6 and 9 contribute to @xmath1 production .",

    "the identity ( [ eq : sigq2 ] ) can also be used to handle central spin - isospin dependent interactions by replacing one or more of the momentum transfers @xmath79 from the tensor interactions by projectile quark spin operators @xmath80 of the central interactions . in this way",
    ", one can show that when both interactions are central , the production of @xmath1 induces 2 untis of spin transfer at the projectile , which can not then remain a proton . however , the production @xmath45 is possible when one interaction is central and the other is tensor , because in this case the projectile suffers only 1 unit of spin transfer .",
    "this mixed tensor - central contribution will not be included in the present exploratory study .",
    "\\(c ) in the result reported here , we have neglected all quark - exchange terms between target baryons .",

    "each of these goes with its own effective projectile pair number , a minor complication that will not be shown in the formulas .    on the target side , there are two separate scatterings with two baryons .",
    "when the inelastic scattering leaves the size of the target baryons unchanged , as we have assumed in this paper , the baryon formfactors themselves could be reabsorbed back into @xmath13 scattering amplitudes as they are reconstructed from the quark - quark amplitudes .",

    "1 gives the differential production cross sections at the triumf proton energy of 516 mev .",
    "the 1985 love - franey ( lf ) @xmath5-matrix @xcite at the lab energy of 515 mev ( on a nucleon target ) is used for @xmath1 masses of @xmath107 2050 , 2100 and 2150 mev , a range of particular interest for the qdcs model mentioned in the introduction .",
    "calculated with the same @xmath13 @xmath5 matrix , these cross sections involve exactly the same invariant production amplitude .",
    "they differ only in the outside kinematical factors @xmath108 in eq.([eq : dcs ] ) and in the fact that the angular distribution covers a narrower range in momentum transfer as @xmath32 increases . for this reason , it is often necessary to show results for only the smallest @xmath109 mev because it has the largest range of momentum transfers .",
    "the cross sections shown are about 7 @xmath6b / sr at the second maximum at about @xmath110 c.m .. they decrease with increasing @xmath1 mass , and should vanish at threshold .",
    "the structure at small angles , seen very clearly in the @xmath111 mev result , comes from the @xmath112 component of the production tensor operator .",
    "its contribution to the differential cross section of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsig ] ) for @xmath111 mev is shown separately as a short dashed curve in fig .  1 .",
    "the remaining contributions are from the @xmath113 components .",
    "being proportional to @xmath114 for small @xmath115 , they are responsible for the second maximum .",
    "the strong @xmath6 dependence means that the angular distributions can be expected to be very different when the colliding particles are polarized .",
    "the production mechanism , requiring at least a double scattering , is particularly sensitive to the dynamics of the effective @xmath29 tensor force , here derived from the empirical @xmath13 tensor force .",
    "it is therefore of interest to show , in fig  2 , how strongly the production cross section for @xmath109 mev at the triumf energy increases as the effective nucleon lab energy of the input @xmath13 @xmath5-matrix is decreased .    since the production cross section",
    "as calculated depends only on the isovector tensor part of the @xmath13 @xmath5-matrix , the effect seen is a direct reflection of the latter s rapid increase with decreasing nucleon energy .",
    "this behavior is well understood in the theory of nuclear forces : the shorter - range part of the tensor force due to the exchange of @xmath4 mesons is opposite in sign to the longer - range part from @xmath3 exchange .",
    "as the scattering energy decreases , the strong and long - range @xmath3-exchange contribution becomes rapidly more dominant .",
    "we shall be able to show separately the results calculated from each of these two parts of the @xmath13 tensor force when we use the full bonn potential .",
    "the inelasticity involved in @xmath1 production for the @xmath32 range examined here is a very appreciable fraction of the energy available in the beam .",
    "given the strong dependence of the production cross section on the effective nucleon energy of the @xmath13 isovector tensor @xmath5-matrix , it is necessary to choose this energy carefully .",
    "for reasons discussed in the last section , we shall use the average lab energy @xmath71 shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tav ] ) which is the arithmetical average over the initial and final states .",
    "the resulting cross sections for different @xmath1 masses are shown in fig .",
    "these are obtained by interpolating the results calculated for the three lab energies @xmath116 515 , 425 and 325 mev tabulated by lf .",
    "we see that interpolated results have increased by a factor of about 2.0 over the value calculated at the incident energy for @xmath117 mev .",
    "the final cross sections at the second maximum are about 13 @xmath6b / sr .",
    "this is very large , but it is perhaps not totally unexpected because the production involves the same amplitudes responsible for the resonance production of @xmath2 from nucleon targets .",
    "the use of empirical @xmath5-matrices takes care of re - scattering or wave - distortion effects in the sense of an impulse approximation .",
    "to determine how important such effects are , we use the full bonn potential treated in the born approximation .",

    "we see that these production cross sections have the same angular behavior as those in fig .  3 for the lf @xmath5-matrix , but their values are higher by a factor of about 2.8 .",
    "the effect might seem huge , but since the calculated cross section is proportional to @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a meson-@xmath13 coupling constant , the @xmath5-matrix reduction of the effective @xmath120 is by a very modest factor of 0.77 . in other words , a strong sensitivity to @xmath13 dynamics is unavoidable in such a high - order production process .",
    "a quantitative calculation of the cross section might well require better @xmath5-matrices constructed from more recent @xmath13 phase shifts .",
    "the use of the bonn potential allows the contributions of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-exchange potentials to be separated .",
    "the cross sections for each contribution alone are also shown in fig .",
    "note that their total contribution to the cross section is not the sum of their separate contributions because amplitudes interfere and the production mechanism is double scattering .",
    "the @xmath3-only result is enormous , but it is effectively controlled by the much weaker @xmath4 exchange contribution . since this cancellation is not a well - determined part of @xmath13 dynamics , fig.4   also shows the importance of using the best @xmath13 input in the calculation .",
    "the born approximation should improve in accuracy with increasing projectile energy .",
    "5 shows how the calculated cross section for @xmath121 2050 mev decreases with increasing energy , while the second maximum moves forward in the angular distribution , but not in the momentum transfer .",
    "both features are consistent with the expected energy dependence of cross sections .",
    "of course , the accuracy of the bonn potential at these higher energies is somewhat uncertain . in spite of this reservation , fig .",
    "5 does suggest that the production cross section will not decrease sharply with increasing energy .",
    "the production cross section also depends on the @xmath1 wavefunction size @xmath94 ( half of the average @xmath37 separation ) .",

    "finally , we address the question of the accuracy of the angle - averaged approximation used this section .",
    "a selected number of angle - integrated cross sections for the triumf energy using the bonn potential with @xmath124 mev have been calculated .",
    "the angle - integrated result at the cm angle @xmath125 is 40.31 ( 31.06 , 6.247 ) @xmath6b / sr when the angle - averaged approximation gives 38.54 ( 32.06 , 6.252 ) @xmath6b / sr instead .",
    "thus the angle - averaged approximation seems to have adequate accuracy .",
    "the present calculations have given only a crude picture of the inelastic production of @xmath1 .",
    "their many limitations will be discussed in the last section .",
    "the dibaryon @xmath1 can not decay into two nucleons if its constituents do not interact .",
    "the simplest interaction that can do it is a two - quark interaction containing the spin @xmath127 , to bridge the gap between initial and final intrinsic spins .",
    "if @xmath1 is a didelta , even when these deltas are not pointlike , the perturbing operator must also contain the isospin operator @xmath128 in order to change a @xmath2 into an @xmath47 at each quark vertex .",
    "it is clear that isospin - independent interactions can not do it .",
    "thus all direct gluon exchanges do not contribute , no matter how strong they are .    among the simplest two - quark interactions that can do it are the one - meson - exchange potentials carried by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we shall show below that their contributions are quite large .",
    "it can be argued that these mesons might not have the presence inside @xmath1 that they have in the outside meson cloud , because much of the dibaryon interior might be in a different vacuum state , the so - called perturbative qcd vacuum , where mesons loose their individuality .",
    "since qcd is flavor - independent , the required @xmath129 operator could only come from the heisenberg isospin exchange operator    @xmath130    arising from the pauli exchange of two quarks .",
    "we now show that the resulting potential has a functional form similar to that for one - meson exchange . in this preliminary study",

    "in addition , it should be an effective coupling constant that might include certain higher - order effects .    of the terms shown , the second term is a tensor interaction which tends to be unobtrusive in baryon spectroscopy , just like tensor forces in nuclear spectroscopy .",
    "however , the first term is the color - magnetic interaction which can be related to the @xmath36 mass difference @xmath137 mev :    @xmath138    here    @xmath139    is the spatial two - quark matrix element in a baryon ( b ) , taken for simplicity to be the same in both @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",
    "there are momentum - conserving @xmath140-functions @xmath141 for the two quarks @xmath131 at each gluon - quark - quark vertex .",
    "is this empirical @xmath29 interaction strong or weak ?",
    "this question can be answered by anticipating that even though both @xmath136 and the gluon propagator in @xmath142 depend significantly on the gluon mass @xmath6 , their effects tend to cancel when the same @xmath36 mass difference is fitted . the interaction strength @xmath136 turns out to be 0.11 gev@xmath143 when @xmath6 is taken to be the @xmath4 meson mass .",
    "in contrast , the equivalent strength of the one - rho - exchange ( ore ) potential in the full bonn potential is    @xmath144    where the factor @xmath145 comes from the reduction from @xmath13 to @xmath29 operators .",
    "this is about 500 times stronger than the @xmath29 interaction strength .",
    "although the @xmath146 coupling constant is not well determined in the @xmath13 interaction , it is clear that the ore potential appropriate to the baryon exterior is some two orders of magnitude stronger than the effective @xmath29 interaction present in the perturbative vacuum of the baryon interior .",
    "this shows that the oge contribution to the partial decay width is negligibly small compared to the meson - exchange contributions .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to complete the derivation of the exchange @xmath29 interaction and to determine how the space - exchange operator @xmath134 further affects the final result .",
    "we therefore go on by noting that the term in @xmath147 containing the @xmath8 decay operator can be isolated by using the expansion    @xmath148    obtained with the help of the identities    @xmath149    and    @xmath150    the final result is    @xmath151    showing only the term which can turn colorless @xmath2 s into colorless @xmath47 s .",
    "this term too has a strength characterized by @xmath136 .",
    "this is the only term that can contribute , in the lowest order , to the decay of the @xmath1 treated as a didelta .    in more realistic models of @xmath1 , colored @xmath2 s appear in the so - called `` hidden - color '' components @xcite .",
    "these colored objects can decay into @xmath13 by both direct and exchange oge potentials via terms proportional to the color operator @xmath152 .",

    "the result is typically 23 times larger than those for the lf @xmath5-matrix in the mass range ( 2050 - 2130 mev ) of interest in the qdcs model , in qualitative agreement with the corresponding behavior in the production cross section .",
    "note however that the leading decay process studied here is first - order in the interaction , but the leading production process is second order .",
    "the `` @xmath3 only '' contribution ( shown as a dash - dot curve ) is again much larger , here by another factor of three in this mass range .",
    "even the `` @xmath4 only '' result ( given by the short dashed curve ) is large , becoming in fact arger than even the `` @xmath3 only ''",
    "contribution after 2690 mev .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the fact that the decay involves interactions at shorter distances and higher energies than the production at triumf energies .",
    "this means that the results for @xmath178 is particularly sensitive to the cancellation between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 exchange interactions in our simple leading - order model .",
    "in fact , the vanishing of the calculated decay width due to the complete destructive interference between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions can be seen in the figure at 2690 mev .    for the xqq interaction appropriate to the perturbative vacuum of the baryon interior",
    ", we find a result of @xmath179 ev at @xmath175 fm , @xmath117 mev and a gluon mass of @xmath180 mev if @xmath147 interaction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vxqq ] ) is treated as a direct @xmath29 interaction .",
    "( this is done by dropping the space - exchange operator @xmath134 and adding baryon elastic formfactors to the expression for @xmath178 . )",
    "compared to the result of 22 mev for `` @xmath4 only '' , this is a factor of @xmath181 smaller , in good agreement with the estimate based on the interaction strengths .    on restoring the space - exchange operator @xmath134 , we find that the width drops drastically by another factor of @xmath182 to only @xmath183 ev .",
    "the result is very sensitive to @xmath94 , being 250 times larger for the smaller @xmath1 radius of @xmath184 fm .",
    "one reason why the result is so small is that the orbital angular momentum in the relative baryon - baryon coordinate is @xmath185 , where the centrifugal potential inhibits the quark exchange . if we had used @xmath186 instead , the result would have been @xmath187 ev , as compared to an @xmath186 width of 190 ev when @xmath134 is purposely dropped .",
    "we conclude from this that in the absence of significant short - range components in the wave function , quark - exchange effects are negligible .    up to this point , we have done the calculation as if the interaction were 100% by meson exchanges via the meson cloud in the baryon exterior , or 100% by gluon exchange in the perturbative vacuum of the baryon interior . in reality",
    ", there is always some `` external '' contribution even when all the six quarks of @xmath1 are in the same cluster .",
    "since the external contribution is so much greater than the internal contribution , some of it will always survive to give a nonnegligible decay width . in the absence of a detailed model describing the precise proportion between the two contributions",
    ", we shall discount our calculated meson - exchange contribution by 50% as a guess of what a more realistic width should be .",
    "the interior correction for gluon exchange discussed here does not apply to the lowest - order production calculated in sec .  3 : the two mesons whose exchanges between projectile and target nucleons are responsible for the inelastic production of @xmath1 are both external virtual mesons .",
    "is the meson - exchange interactions used here too strong ?",
    "this can be answered partially by using the same method to calculate the decay width of that archtypical baryon decay @xmath188 . using the @xmath34 coupling constant of @xmath189 given by the full bonn potential and reducing to a @xmath190 coupling constant , we find a result of only 70 mev , much less than the experimental value of 120 mev .",
    "this result is in agreement with past calculations of this width @xcite .",
    "one might be tempted to increase the calculated result by a factor of @xmath191 , but this is not advisable because a real @xmath3 on the energy shell is emitted in the @xmath2 decay , whereas the @xmath8 decay involves virtual mesons off the energy shell @xcite .",
    "the off - shell coupling constants that appear are more appropriately determined from nuclear forces , at least in principle .",
    "if we had been calculating the @xmath192 decay by the same method , we would be justified to increase the calculated result by a factor @xmath193 for that vertex emitting the real pion .",
    "the calculated @xmath1 production cross section and decay width can be expected to depend sensitively on the quark wavefunction of the @xmath1 , perhaps even more so than its theoretical mass .",
    "we shall consider qualitatively some of the issues involved .",
    "one of these issues is the possibility of quark delocalization , which refers to the idea that under certain circumstances a quark may find it energetically favorable to be partly on the left side and partly on the right side of a dibaryon .",
    "the qdcs model @xcite actually describes each quark in the @xmath1 wavefunction as 50/50 left or right .",
    "the six - quark @xmath1 wavefunction then has the structure    @xmath194    after the projection of relative s - states between the clusters and a correction for the position of the center of mass , the wavefunction simplifies to the form shown after the right arrow .",
    "its components fall roughtly into two groups : there is a group of normal ( `` n '' ) clusters of @xmath195 configurations made up of @xmath196 and @xmath197 with no delocalized quark .",
    "they have the probability of    @xmath198    the remaining group of components @xmath199 and @xmath200 has one delocalized quark ( `` dq '' ) away from a normal @xmath195 configuration , and the remaining probability of @xmath201    for the normal group , the projection of s - states makes the wavefunction spherical symmetric in the relative baryon - baryon coordinate , and very similar to the gaussian wavefunction of our didelta model .",
    "in fact , the maximum overlap between the two wavefunctions is close to 100% .",
    "there is to be sure some depression of the two - center relative wavefunction near the origin of the relative coordinate , but the effect is quite unimportant in the wavefunction overlap . the behavior of the short - distance wavefunction is probably much more important in the production and decay processes considered in this paper , but it is likely that the short - distance wavefunction is not very good in both models .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath202 component is entirely absent in the didelta model and is probably too weak in the qdcs model .    though subject to these additional uncertainties , our counting suggests that this normal group will contribute essentially the full amount , i.e. about 28% of that calculated in our model in both decay and production .    for the abnormal components with one `` wrong - way '' quark",
    ", the contribution could be very different , especially if there is special coherence between the normal and abnormal amplitudes .",
    "we are not in a position to estimate such coherent contributions because it would require a specific model . as far as its incoherent contribution",
    "is concerned , the worse that can happen is that it will vanish .",
    "this must be a rather extreme situation , because three of the nine pairs of interacting quarks involve the `` wrong - way '' quark , and the interaction could scatter it back to form a normal cluster structure . in the remaining six pairs ,",
    "the `` wrong - way '' quark is a spectator , which requires a wavefunction overlap to get back to normal .",
    "there is thus a reduction in the calculated decay or production amplitude of the order of @xmath203 or 1/e for the spectator contribution , more if the clusters are farther apart .",
    "we then end up with an estimate for the decay width or production cross section of the order of 720% from these abnormal components .",
    "thus very crudely , we expect the delocalization to reduce the calculated decay width or production cross section by a factor of 1/21/3 .",
    "another model - dependent issue is the contribution of hidden - color ( hc ) configurations .",
    "our didelta model used without quark exchanges between the two baryon clusters contains no hc component .",
    "in contrast , most quark models of the @xmath1 contains 80% hc components where the first three quarks are in a color - octet state .",
    "these hc components are expected to contribute less , perhaps significantly less , than the baryon - baryon components .",
    "a calculation of their contributions using the method of this paper is now underway . for the time being , we shall allow for some contributions from the hc components by reducing the baryon - baryon results by a factor of 1/2 .",
    "( the reduction factor is 1/5 when the hc components contribute nothing . )",
    "the final educated guesses for @xmath1 decay and production for the quark - delocalization model used with the love - franey nn @xmath5-matrix at @xmath204 gev and @xmath175 fm are as follows : the decay width is decreased from 9 mev to about 1 mev when an `` interior '' correction of 1/2 and an octet - octet reduction factor of 1/2 are also included .",
    "the production cross section at triumf energy is reduced from 13 to about 2 @xmath6b / sr at the second maximum .",
    "the leading - order processes studied here suggest that the inelastic production cross section of @xmath1 might be in the @xmath6b / sr range , while its decay width into two nucleons might be in mev s .",
    "love - franey empirical @xmath13 @xmath5-matrices are used to include all @xmath13 re - scattering effects to all orders in the decay and in an impulse approximation for the production .",
    "other aspects of the reported calculations are not sufficiently realistic because of approximations made in the hadron wavefunctions and in the treatment of the reaction mechanisms .",
    "it is worthwhile to enumerate the most serious of these problems",
    ".    the glauber multiple - diffraction model used in the calculation of the production cross section might be quite good for elastic scattering at small angles .",
    "its validity for large inelasticities and at large angles is unknown .",
    "it is necessary to correct for effects neglected by the glauber model , especially at large angles @xcite .",
    "however , there is probably no point in doing this unless one can also include higher - order production processes .",
    "these are the usual difficulties connected with the calculation of strong - interaction cross sections , and as usual , we see no simple solution .",
    "the gaussian model of @xmath1 used here is very crude .",
    "depending on the model , we need to add delocalization and short - distance refinements .",
    "the s - state wave function used for the deuteron target is also inadequate .",
    "it is not difficult to put in the d - state @xmath13 component .",
    "other short - range components such as hidden - color configurations can readily be treated too .",
    "the difficulty lies instead in the lack of knowledge on how strong these components are .",
    "studies of the effects of short - distance wavefunctions require sustained efforts .    in the calculation of the partial @xmath8 decay width , it is necessary to account more carefully for the role played by external meson exchanges versus internal gluon exchanges .",
    "it is obvious that this too can not be done on a quantitative basis without a more realistic model of the @xmath1 wavefunction .",
    "it will be necessary to include higher - order processes not yet included by using @xmath13 @xmath5-matirces .      the theoretical picture concerning the dibaryon @xmath1 at the present time seems to be as follows : its calculated mass has been in the range 2050@xcite2840@xcite mev",
    ". its inelastic production cross section could be significant , i.e. in the @xmath6b / sr range .",
    "its partial decay width into two nucleons is probably in mev s for the low - mass candidate . because its calculated mass is so sensitive to certain assumptions concerning quark dynamics in hadrons , any positive or negative experimental information on its presence in a certain mass range has interesting implications .    what is the experimental situation concerning isoscalar dibaryons ?",

    "this means that any extraction of a @xmath44 bound from the @xmath209 bound will depend on a model - dependent theoretical analysis , and can not be a pure experimental bound .",
    "to my best knowledge , the only direct experimental upper bound for resonance production in the @xmath44 reaction is an unpublished lampf experiment based on the @xmath210 reaction at @xmath211 mev and @xmath212 ( lab ) .",
