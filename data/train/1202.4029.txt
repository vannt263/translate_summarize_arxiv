    "the upturn of the conductivity spectra at low frequencies is due to the metallic drude response . as temperature is lowered , the drude response is significantly reduced , indicating a vanishing bulk metallic fermi surface ( @xmath16 is plotted in the inset ) .",
    "however , the remnant drude response at the lowest temperature shows that the material retains bulk metallic properties .",

    "these data were obtained with samples from the same rod as the crystal used in this study and we therefore expect the properties to be quantitatively similar .",
    "the drude model of the lowest temperature conductivity should produce comparable values between optics and transport only if the fermi energy is located at an equivalent location in the bulk conduction band .",
    "this is because the plasma frequency of the drude response is related to the number density of free carriers as : @xmath28 = 4 @xmath29 . using the plasma frequency as measured via optics , @xmath19 = 1485 @xmath11",
    ", the resulting band mass is @xmath30 . the plasma edge seen in optics",

    "the relationship @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the fermi velocity , should provide the band velocity of the linear bulk conduction band along the fastest direction and therefore , the fermi velocity in the fast direction of the bulk fs is @xmath35 m / s .",
    "next , we invoke @xmath36 in order to determine the separation between the bottom of the conduction band and the fermi energy .",

    "we explicitly note that most of the cited works have been performed or calculated for the [ 111 ] surface , whereas our present work is performed on the [ 211 ] surface .",
    "the surface state band structure along this surface has not presently been determined by photoemission studies .",
    "turning to the in - field data , fig . [ waterfalls ] shows reflectance in 0.1 t increments at 10k ( top ) and 100k ( bottom ) .",
    "the magnetic field was applied parallel to the bisectrix axis ( c1 ) , perpendicular to the bisectrix plane ( c2-c3 plane ) , and parallel to the _ k_-vector of the incident electric field ( faraday geometry ) in order to access the previously observed 2d fs deduced from quantum oscillation ( qo ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the large ll absorptions become visible above @xmath9 0.3 t , which likely correspond to bulk states , as well as other smaller field - dependent features .",
    "models of the 10k data were used to extract values of the cyclotron resonance ( cr ) ( see appendix ) .",
    "the models do not allow for the observation of the much weaker lls due to the ss bands .",
    "therefore , extracting lls from the raw reflectance via modeling is not possible for anything other than the most prominent lls because the surface state charge density is very small and therefore produces exceedingly weak features in reflectance .",

    "once we perform a derivative of the reflectance with respect to the applied field , dr / dh , the weakest lls become quite evident . indeed , these features are so small that they would have gone unobserved without utilizing this technique .",

    "the value of dr / dh corresponds with the color scale .",
    "the intermediate field data are interpolated .",
    "as can be readily seen , there are multiple lls , as well as features ( dark red ) that correspond to the field - dependent behavior of the bulk drude plasma edge .",
    "all of the observed lls display @xmath5 dependence .",
    "a classical picture explaining the origin of the cr is that when a magnetic field is applied to a metal , free charge carriers become bound in orbits around the field lines , provided the mean - free path is sufficiently long .",
    "such bound charge carriers create a resonance in the optical reflectance , dependent upon the strength of the applied field , the carrier s effective mass and number density . since the band dispersion near @xmath8 is quadratic in most materials , the frequency of the cr and resultant ll transitions are @xmath44 . as was noted early on , lls in elemental bismuth",

    "recently , the bulk @xmath3 valence band in bi@xmath39sb@xmath40 has been demonstrated to be linear using arpes @xcite , in addition to the observation of linear dirac bands that form sss .    in order to describe the energy spectrum of the lls due to linearly dispersive bands",

    "[ splls ] we plot the single particle lls for both the bulk ( top ) and sss ( bottom ) .",
    "there are several important features to be learned from these figures , as far as allowed optical ll transitions .",

    "second , bulk intraband transitions are not allowed once all of the bulk conduction lls rise above @xmath8 .",
    "( using the parameters mentioned in the figure caption , this takes place near 1.5 t .",
    "of course , using a larger ( smaller ) effective mass means bulk intraband transitions are allowed to higher ( lower ) fields . )",
    "third , all of the ll transitions due to the sss ( fig .",
    "[ splls ] , bottom ) will extrapolate to zero - frequency at zero - field .",
    "fourth , the 0th ll is almost field independent for the parameters we use ( see fig .",
    "[ splls ] caption ) , and there is no spin - splitting .",
    "fifth , ll transitions will not become allowed until the lls cross @xmath8 , and therefore the onset of optical transitions should be evident in the data .",
    "we note that the bulk band gap @xmath21 and fermi level @xmath8 may not be field - independent , but any such field dependence should be a higher - order correction and will not significantly impact the results we show here .",
    "also , the placement of the dirac point , from where the surface state lls disperse in field , may not be located in the center of the bulk band gap .",
    "additionally , we show that a simple model of the magnetic field dependence of the drude plasma edge in metals @xcite can reproduce the behavior of the most prominent field - dependent features .",
    "figure [ plasmaedge ] demonstrates how the cyclotron active and inactive modes in magnetic field lead to a splitting of the plasma edge , where the cyclotron active mode moves the plasma edge higher in energy while the inactive mode suppresses the plasma edge .",
    "qualitatively , such behavior is present in the data we show .",
    "however , more detailed analysis is needed in order to make definitive quantitative conclusions .",
    "the quantitative similarity with the data is suggestive.,width=326 ]",
    "based on the information gained from the single particle lls , we can make several immediate conclusions about the optical ll transitions in bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 presented in fig . [ drdh ] .",
    "first , none of the observed lls extrapolate to a zero - field value equal to the bulk band gap @xmath21 . therefore , based on eq .",
    "[ equation1 ] , none of the lls are due to bulk interband transitions between lls in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "second , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ splls ] , if there were any intraband ll transitions due to the bulk conduction bands present , these transitions should disappear by @xmath9 1 t .",
    "therefore , none of the lls can be understood to be due to the bulk bands within the paradigm presented by eq .",
    "[ equation1 ] .",
    "third , the six highest energy lls are observed to ",
    "turn on \" at finite field , consistent with the notion that once the lls cross above @xmath8 , transitions become allowed .    a logical place to begin to quantitatively understand the lls is to assume that the same surface state observed in quantum oscillation measurements on nearly identical samples is also contained in our data .",
    "results from qo measurements determined the presence of a 2d fs with @xmath34 = 8.5x10@xmath58 m/s for very low fields ( @xmath591 t ) and at low temperature @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ sslls ] we show the predicted ll transitions due to a dirac band with a fermi velocity of @xmath60 = 8.5x10@xmath58 m/s for the n=0 to n=1 transitions ( blue lines ) , 1 - 2:2 - 1 ( black lines ) , and 2 - 3:3 - 2 ( red lines ) transitions . therefore , we confirm previous measurements of the 2d fs .",
    "overlaid on the data at 10k .",
    "we have included three different fermi velocities in order to explain all of the observed lls .",
    "as labeled , @xmath60 = 8.5x10@xmath58 m/s ( black symbols ) , @xmath61 = 6x10@xmath58 m/s ( white symbols ) and @xmath62 = 5x10@xmath58 m/s ( red symbols ) and the 0 - 1 ( dashed line ) , 1 - 2:2 - 1 ( crosses ) , and 2 - 3:3 - 2 ( open circles ) transitions are given .",
    "we did not correct for the drude effective mass ( @xmath53=1 ) and used a very moderate g - factor of the surface states ( @xmath52=120).,width=326 ]    additionally , we find that by applying eq .",
    "[ equation2 ] , the number of lls is greater than what can be explained with a single surface dirac band .",
    "that is , in order to explain the data , we must include transitions that would exist in the presence of two additional dirac bands with fermi velocities determined by fitting the lls : @xmath61 = 6x10@xmath58 m/s and @xmath62 = 5x10@xmath58 m/s .",
    "this presents one possible physical interpretation of the origin of the weakest lls observed . in this scenario , it is interesting that the 0 - 1 transitions from @xmath61 and @xmath62 are either not present or completely overwhelmed by the behavior of the bulk plasma edge .",
    "arpes studies of the [ 211 ] surface are required to determine the number of dirac bands , and should be able to use our ll observations as a guide .",
    "the frequency at which these transitions begin provides a clue as to the separation between the upper ( + ) and lower ( - ) lls and ultimately provides a measure of the location of the dirac point ( @xmath63 ) defined with respect to the bottom of the conduction band : the optical ll transitions of the ss bands will appear at @xmath42=@xmath64 , and will extrapolate to zero - frequency at zero - field . at _ _",
    "t__=10k , the higher order transitions begin between 425 - 500 @xmath11 while the 0 - 1 ll transition is seen to begin at an energy equal to 1/2 of the higher order transitions : @xmath65 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath66 , the 0 - 1 ll @xmath60 transition first appears near 225 @xmath11 . for @xmath8 = 42.5 @xmath11 , and therefore e@xmath67",
    "is located @xmath9182.5 @xmath11 below the bottom of the bulk l@xmath68 band , @xmath9 11 @xmath11 above the center of the bulk band gap .",
    "interestingly , we do not observe bulk ll transitions across the gap @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , given the sensitivity of our method for detecting lls .",
    "one possibility is that the bulk transitions have short lifetimes , much shorter than the lifetimes of the sss .",
    "the width of the drude peak is one clue to the expected bulk ll lifetime , and roughly has a value of @xmath69 = 80 - 120 @xmath11 , depending on modeling parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the lifetime of the sss as determined from the width of the ll resonances is @xmath69 = 10 - 30 @xmath11 , implying the ss carriers have lifetimes as much as 10 times longer than the bulk carriers .",
    "transport measurements suggest a similar picture , where the mean free path of the bulk carriers was 16 nm while the ss carriers was 150 nm @xcite . our data , therefore , is consistent with the notion of scattering - protected sss , while the bulk states are more strongly scattering .    in conclusion",
    ", we have detailed a magneto - infrared study of the topological insulator bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , demonstrating the presence of a multitude of landau levels with @xmath5 dependence @xcite .",
    "after careful analysis , the lls that we observe can only be understood to arise from dirac - like bands within the bulk band gap .",
    "we therefore provide direct evidence for the existence of topological surface states in bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , coexisting with a bulk metallic fermi surface .",
    "future temperature and doping dependent ll studies as well as gated structures where the chemical potential can be tuned into various energy regimes of the band structure will help to further elucidate the origins of the observed phenomena we present .",
    "we thank gil refael and doron bergman for enlightening discussions .",
    "funding was provided by darpa and fena .",
