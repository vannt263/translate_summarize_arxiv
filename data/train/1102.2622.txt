    "the prevailing theories of planet formation posit that planets are formed in the disk of gas and dust encircling a young star @xcite . a close alignment between the rotation axis ( spin ) of the star and that of the orbital motion of the planets is expected because a star and its planets inherit their angular momentum from a common source - the protostellar disk .",
    "however , measurements of the relative spin orbit alignment of transiting extrasolar planets ( exoplanets ) through the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite reveal that a considerable fraction of the hot jupiters ( exoplanets with a mass similar or greater than that of jupiter and much hotter ) have misaligned spin - orbit @xcite .",
    "other properties of hot jupiters , such as a temperature independent of their distance from their host star and of its temperature as observed for the hot jupiters orbiting the nearby star hr 8799 @xcite , also challenge @xcite the _ in situ _ planet formation theories @xcite .",
    "native planets formed in the protostelar disk may be scattered later into misaligned orbits by planetary encounters @xcite or by the kozai mechanism @xcite .",
    "but , such mechanisms are unlikely to explain the large fraction of hot jupiters with misaligned orbits @xcite and a temperature not correlated with their distance from the host star @xcite . here",
    "we suggest an alternative plausible _ ex situ _ origin of hot giant gas planets with misaligned spin - orbit , namely , the formation of high - speed gas blobs in the explosive death of stars .",
    "such gas blobs are observed in large numbers in nearby supernova remnants @xcite planetary nebulae @xcite and star formation regions .",
    "the existence of these gas blobs with cometary - like appearance ( see figs.1,2 ) , probably due to overtaking winds , was not expected , their origin is still not understood and their fate is unknown .",
    "we shall argue that they grow in mass and slow down in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by sweeping in the ambient matter in their way .",
    "they cool by radiation and if their mass exceeds the jeans mass @xcite they contract gravitationally into giant jupiters .",
    "the collapsed and uncollapsed jupiter - mass objects can perturb stellar planetary systems and kick bound planets into misaligned orbits .",
    "they can also be captured into misaligned orbits around host stars .",
    "the uncollapsed ones may then collapse or be tidally disrupted and form a tilted gas disk where _ in situ _ formation of planets with misaligned spin - orbit can take place .    if the numbers and properties of the cometary blobs ( cbs ) observed in the supernova remnant cassiopeia a ( cas a ) and in the helix nebula represent faithfully those formed in other supernova remnants ( snrs ) and planetary nebulae ( pns ) , then the total number of jupiter - mass objects free - floating in the ism of our galaxy may exceed the number of stars by more than two orders of magnitude",
    ". these free - floating jupiter - mass objects could have accreted most of the gas and dust in the ism of galaxies and may explain the presently small mass ratio between gas and stars in galaxies ( @xmath0 1:10 in the milky way ) .",
    "the fraction of cbs that end up as free - floating jupiters in the galaxy can not be reliably estimated from theory .",
    "however , the density of free - floating jupiters in the galaxy can be measured through their microlensing effects .",
    "in fact , presence of a significant fraction of the missing baryons in galaxies in free - floating jupiters is consistent with the measured optical depth for microlensing towards the galactic bulge by the macho @xcite and ogle @xcite collaborations ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the macho collaboration also reported an optical depth towards the stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) which is larger than those expected from lensing by the known populations of stars in the galaxy and the lmc @xcite .",
    "however , the microlensing optical depths towards the lmc stars that were measured by the eros @xcite and ogle @xcite collaborations , are much smaller than that measured by macho and are consistent , within errors , with those expected from the known stellar populations in the lmc and the galaxy . in view of the conflicting results , the small statistics of lensing events , and the large uncertainties in the modeling of the lmc , it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion on free - floating planets in the lmc from the measured values of the microlensing optical depths of the lmc .",
    "second generation microlensing surveys using ground based telescopes , or space based telescopes such as the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) , that unlike kepler , will be sensitive also to free - floating planets @xcite and will measure or set limits on their density in the ism , their masses and the fraction of baryons in the galaxy which reside in such planets .",
    "observational support for the hypothesis of _ ex situ _ origin of misaligned hot jupiters and other planets in orbits around host stars could also come from the detection of a large population of free - floating hot jupiters in the ism in deep pencil searches with extremely large optical and infra - red telescopes ( elts ) equipped with advanced adaptive optics and having a much greater light collecting ability than that of the current largest telescopes .",
    "a large population of free - floating hot jupiters in the ism may also contribute significantly to the unresolved diffuse infra - red background radiation .",
    "finally , dramatic flux changes occurring over several weeks to months in the radio flux from quasars , such as 0954 + 658 @xcite , and episodes of multiple images of radio pulsars @xcite were shown @xcite to be reproduceable by refraction from the ionized skin of an hypothesized large population of neutral clouds having a few astronomical units in radius and masses @xmath1 , which are free floating in the galactic ism and are exposed to the galactic ionizing uv flux .",
    "high resolution imaging of nearby young supernova remnants from the explosive death of massive stars , such as snr cass a @xcite and snr 3c 58 @xcite and of nearby planetary nebula remnants of the explosive death of sun - like stars , such as the helix nebula @xcite , the ring nebula , the dumbbell nebula and the eskimo nebula , reveal that thousands of cometary blobs ( cbs ) with masses similar to that of earth and radii of hundreds of astronomical unit are moving away from the center of the explosion along radial directions .",
    "the fate of cbs formed in the explosive deaths of stars is not known . probably , most of these cbs grow in mass and slow down by accreting the ism particles ( gas and dust ) in their path , and cool by radiation .",
    "when their mass exceeds the jeans mass @xcite , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the boltzman constant , @xmath4 is the temperature of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the radius of the cb and @xmath7 is the proton mass , they collapse gravitationally into a hot jupiter .",
    "the outer 1825 cbs observed in the snr cass a @xcite have typical velocities @xmath8 km / s , a radius @xmath9 corresponding to 0.002 pc ( at 3.4 kpc , the estimated distance to cas a ) , and @xmath10 , i.e. , a mean column density @xmath11 , and a mass @xmath12 g ( @xmath13 twice that of earth ) .",
    "the measured radial velocities of over 450 cbs in snr 3c 58 , reveal @xcite two distinct populations , one with average projected velocities of 770 km / s , and a high nii / h@xmath14 line emission ratio and the other showing velocities less than 250 km / s and a much lower nii / h@xmath14 line emission ratio .",
    "it was suggested that the low velocity populations were formed in the ejecta of the progenitor star long before its supernova explosion while the higher velocity cbs were formed during or after the sn explosion .",
    "the estimated current rate of galactic core collapse sn explosions @xcite is @xmath15 1/50 y. this rate , being proportional to the galactic star formation rate , was much higher in the past .",
    "thus , over the past 13.2 gy or so , the estimated age of the oldest stars in the galaxy @xcite , there have been more than @xmath16 core collapse sn explosions .",
    "if the mean number of cbs formed in an sn explosion is represented by the 1825 cbs resolved in the snr cas a , then more than @xmath17 cbs were launched into the ism of the galaxy in sn explosions during its age .",
    "many more cbs are launched in planetary nebulae than in sn explosions .",
    "detailed observations of the nearby helix nebula at a distance of 219 pc with high resolutions telescopes such as the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , the very large telescope ( vlt ) and the subaru telescope revealed more than 40,000 cbs @xcite . if these cbs are well represented by the cb ki , which was studied in detail in matsuura et al .  2007 , then their typical radius is 0.75 arcsec or @xmath6=0.0008 pc and their h@xmath18 density is @xmath19 .",
    "these yield a cb mass @xmath20 g , which is three times larger than the mass of earth , ( @xmath21 g ) and a mean column density @xmath22 .    the local space density of white dwarf stars ,",
    "presumably mostly born in pns , was found to be @xcite @xmath23 , with a corresponding mass density of @xmath24 , which is roughly 5% of the local mass density in stars that was measured @xcite with hipparcos ( @xmath25 corresponding to a local number density @xmath26 ) . the birth rate of planetary nebulae is roughly that of white dwarfs .",
    "assuming that the number of cbs per planetary nebula is @xmath27 as was observed in the helix nebula with the spitzer space telescope and the subaru telescope ( see fig.1 ) and that the local ratio of white dwarfs to stars represents the galactic ratio , then the local density of jupiter - mass objects is roughly @xmath28 and their number in the galaxy exceeds the number of stars by roughly three orders of magnitude .",
    "high - speed projectiles such as those ejected in sn explosions and launced by microquasars decelerate in the ism by accreting the gas and dust on their way .",
    "momentum conservation with the neglect of radiative losses seems to describe well their deceleration : consider first the deceleration of the spherical shell of initial mass , radius and radial velocity , @xmath29 , respectively , ejected in sn explosion into an ism of a constant density @xmath30 .",
    "momentum conservation with the neglect of energy losses yields a radial velocity @xmath31 , where as a function of swept in ism mass @xmath32 . in the limit",

    "the slow - down of a cb of initial mass @xmath38 , radius @xmath6 , baryon density @xmath39 and velocity @xmath40 by mass acreetion along its path in the ism is described by @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 in order to reduce its velocity by a factor @xmath3 , a cb must accrete an ism mass @xmath43 . neglecting its relatively slow thermal expansion",
    ", it must sweep in a column density @xmath3 - 1 times its own mean column density @xmath44 .",
    "i.e. , cross a distance @xmath45 which takes a time @xmath46 .",
    "initially , the temperature of the surface of a cb facing the young neutron star ( ns ) in snrs or the white dwarf ( wd ) in pns is determined by its illumination by the young neutron star at the center of the snr or the white dwarf at the center of the pn .",
    "for instance , in the absence of an internal or an external heat source other than the light of the white dwarf at the center of the pn at a distance @xmath47 pc , their surface temperature @xmath48 of their illuminated side would be roughly , @xmath49k for a typical wd radius @xmath50 km and wd surface temperature @xmath51k . the illuminated surface , however , is visible from earth at such distances by light emitted from the decay of atomic and molecular levels which are excited by the incident light .",
    "a thin photoionized `` skin '' of the cbs can be maintained by the galactic uv background radiation even at large distances from their source .",
    "this photoionized skin of cbs in the ism can be responsible for strong scintillations observed in the radio emission from extragalactic and galactic compact radio sources @xcite .    far away from the central star ,",
    "the only significant heat source of cbs is the kinetic energy deposited by the collision of the swept in ism gas and dust particles with the cbs molecular gas . without any other heat source , the cbs cool by radiative decay of rotational and vibrational molecular levels excited by internal collisions .",
    "the temperature of a cb adjusts itself such that its cooling rate by radiation equals the rate of this energy deposition .",
    "if the radiation can be approximated by a black body radiation , then @xmath52 this yields a rather low equilibrium temperature @xmath53^{1/4 }   \\approx 0.044\\ , \\left[{v\\over { \\rm km}}\\right]^{3/4}\\ ,    \\left[{n_{ism}\\over { \\rm cm^3}}\\right]^{1/4}\\ , { \\rm k}\\ , ,   \\label{t}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the stefan - boltzman constant .",
    "this equilibrium temperature decreases when the cb decelerates by mass accretion from @xmath0 44k for @xmath55 , to below 10k for @xmath56 .",
    "because of their low temperature and their large size , thermal expansion of cbs is negligible during their deceleration : consider a non collapsed spherical blob of @xmath5 gas of a total mass @xmath57 , a constant density and an initial radius @xmath58 cm that expands with the speed of sound @xmath59 , where @xmath60=1.4 is the adiabatic constant for an ideal h@xmath18 gas . if the cb cools mainly by radiation according to the stefan boltzman law , then @xmath61 . by dividing these two rates , separating the @xmath6 and @xmath4 dependences and integrating the resulting equation from initial @xmath62 to a final @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64 where we have assumed that @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath66 and @xmath67k , the rhs of the last equation yields a negligible expansion , @xmath68 .",
    "the outer cbs observed in the snr cas a @xcite have typically a mean column density @xmath69 , and a mass @xmath70 g ( @xmath13 twice that of earth ) .",
    "hence galactic column densities above a few @xmath71 are sufficient to slow down the cbs from cas a to velocities smaller than the local galactic escape velocity @xcite @xmath72 such slowed - down cbs continue to accrete interstellar matter , grow up in mass , slow down further and cool by radiation until they are captured by a host star or their mass exceeds the jeans mass , @xmath73 for @xmath74k and @xmath75 cm , and they collapse to hot jupiters free - floating in the galactic ism .",
    "moreover , most star formation and sn explosions take place within large molecular clouds .",
    "this is a natural consequence of their low temperatures and high densities .",
    "large molecular clouds have a typical size of tens of pc and a typical baryon density @xmath76 .",
    "most of the cbs which are ejected in a supernova explosion within such a dense environment slow down completely within the molecular cloud .",
    "some may escape into the ism with rather a small velocity and virialize there .",
    "some of the cbs in the molecular clouds can seed there star formation by mass accretion , while other cbs can be captured there into planetary orbits around newly born stars .",
    "very high velocity cbs from sn explosions outside molecular clouds that are moving in galactic directions of small column density will escape into the low - density intergalactic space where they will expand before they reach the jeans mass and enrich the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with metals produced in sn explosions .    in the case of snr 3c 58 ,",
    "the measured radial velocities of the cbs are smaller than those observed in cas a , roughly by an order of magnitude , probably because of their deceleration during the long time since the sn explosion ( about 3000 - 4000 yeas ago ) relative to that of cas a ( about 330 years ago ) .",
    "the fate of the cbs observed in planetary nebulae probably is similar .",
    "if they are well represented by cb k1 in the helix nebula at a distance of 219 pc that has been studied in detail @xcite , they have a typical cb mass of @xmath20 g , which is three times larger than the mass of earth , and a mean column density @xmath77 .",
    "their mass grows by collision and merger with other cbs and by accreting the ism gas and dust in their way .",
    "they cool by radiation until they are captured by a host star or their mass exceeds the jeans mass and then they collapse gravitationally .",
    "after collapse they accrete rather a negligible amount of additional ism gas and dust because of their small size .",
    "a large fraction of the jupiter - mass objects will end in the galactic disk as uncollapsed jupiter - mass gas clouds or free - floating jupiters .",
    "some of these jupiters may be captured through dynamical friction , first into the oort cloud of stars and from there into misaligned and eccentric planetary orbits .",
    "they can also kick native planets in aligned orbits around a star into misaligned orbits , particularly if they are super jupiters .",
    "the encounter rate of an alien planet with the oort cloud of stars is given roughly by @xmath78 where we adopted a 1000 astronomical units as the effective radius of the oort cloud and a virial velocity @xmath79 of alien planets .",
    "such a rate yields thousands of encounters with a star during an age comparable to the age of the galaxy .",
    "uncollapsed free - floating gas clouds can also be captured by stars and be tidally disrupted into a disk with a misaligned spin - orbit around the host star , or strongly perturb their planetary system .",
    "their star crossing rate is roughly @xmath80 where @xmath81 is their local density , @xmath82 is their cross section and @xmath79 is their velocity .",
    "such rates yield a high probability of jupiter - mass clouds to be captured or strongly perturb the planetary system of most of the stars of the galaxy during their life .",
    "formation of planets in such misaligned disks around host stars or perturbing strongly its planetary system will result in planets with eccentric and misaligned spin - orbit .",
    "the prevailing theories of planet formation posit a protoplanetary disk which is part of the protostellar disk left over after the formation of the host star .",
    "such theories imply a close alignment between the rotation axis of the star and that of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "however , alien disks which are formed by capture of cometary blobs are expected to be warped and misaligned . employing adaptive optics or interferometry it is possible to image some of the planet - forming disks in nearby systems and determine their alignment @xcite .",
    "while in some of the systems the disk is symmetrical , in others @xcite it is clearly lopsided , which hints at processes occuring much later than the original stellar formation .",
    "what we might be seeing in these systems is the recent capture of a cometary blob , which may form misaligned planets .",
    "microlensing of stars @xcite by planets has already been used to search for free - floating planets @xcite .",
    "the effective cross section for gravitational microlensing of a star at a distance @xmath83 by an intervening mass @xmath57 at a distance @xmath84 is given roughly by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the angular radius of the einstein ring image of the lensed star created if the lens is lying on the line of sight to the star .",
    "the optical depth for gravitational lensing of a star in the galactic bulge at a distance @xmath83 by free - floating jupiters with a mass density @xmath87 $ ] at a distance @xmath88 along the line of sight to the star is given by , @xmath89\\,x\\ , ( 1-x)\\ , dx\\ , .",
    "\\label{taul}\\ ] ] thus , if the mass density of planets is proportional to the stellar mass density , then they contribute to the total optical depth for microlensing in the same proportion .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ taul ] ) that the optical depth for microlensing of stars in the galactic bulge by stars along their line of sight is given approximately by @xmath90 where @xmath91 km is the schwarzschild radius of the total mass of the stars in the galaxy , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 kpc is the stellar scale length in the galactic disk .",
    "this optical depth is much smaller than @xmath94 measured by the macho collaboration @xcite and @xmath95 measured by the ogle collaboration @xcite .",
    "these measurements leave enough room for a significant contribution from free - floating jupiters to the microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge .",
    "the typical duration of a microlensing event is the lens crossing time of the einstein ring , @xmath96 , where the @xmath97 is the lens - source relative transverse velocity observed from earth .",
    "the typical duration of microlensing events of stars in the galactic bulge ( @xmath98 kpc ) by free floating jupiters ( @xmath99 ) in the galactic bulge ( @xmath100 kpc ) and for @xmath101 km / s ( the typical random velocity of stars in the galactic bulge ) is roughly , @xmath102 the same lens placed at half the distance to the bulge has the maximal effective cross section for microlensing of bulge stars that is only larger roughly by a factor 2 .",
    "the duration of the microlensing event is similar , @xmath103 day .",
    "however , if the distribution of free floating jupiters is proportional to that of the galactic stars , then most of the micro lensing events of bulge stars by floating jupiters are by those present in the bulge , with a typical duration of 1 day .    for the lmc , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 kpc @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ taul ] ) yields an optical depth for self lensing of lmc stars by lmc stars , @xmath106 , while the macho collaboration reported @xcite @xmath107 , the eros collaboratin found @xcite @xmath108 , and the ogle collaboration concluded @xcite that @xmath109 .",
    "the spread of the measured values of the microlensing optical depth towards the lmc stars and the large error bars also leave enough room for a significant contribution from free - floating jupiters in the lmc to the microlensing optical depth of the lmc .",
    "although microlensing surveys seem to be promising for the search for free - floating jupiters , they can not detect uncollapsed jupiter - mass clouds if their density distribution is such that their enclosed mass within a radius @xmath110 satisfies @xmath111 ( e.g. , an isothermal sphere ) .",
    "the einstein radius of such uncollapsed clouds ( i.e. , clouds with masses smaller than @xmath112 ) placed anywhere along the line of sight to the galactic bulge is smaller than their radius of @xmath113 cm , at least by two orders of magnitude , which makes them practically nondetectable through gravitational lensing .",
    "however , evidence for a large galactic population of free floating clouds with masses @xmath114 might come from future observations of scintillations in the radio lightcurves of galactic and extragalactic compact radio sources such as pulsars , microquasars , quasars and gamma ray bursts .",
