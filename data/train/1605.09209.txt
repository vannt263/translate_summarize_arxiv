    ". from fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] , we see that the size change with the temperature for the @xmath26 chain is more prominent compared to that of the @xmath23 chain , which is due to difference in scaling of @xmath69 with @xmath1 for the coiled and globular states.@xcite in fig .",

    "[ fig : b ] shows a gradual change in @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "it is known that the coil - to - globule transition is a first - order transition only in the case of rigid and semirigid chains.@xcite hence the continuous transition in our simulation is not surprising because the polymer chain used in the simulations , is fully flexible due to the absence of the angular and dihedral interactions .",
    "although it is not within the scope of this paper , the transition nature in generic models can be explored by systematically incorporating angular and dihedral potentials .",
    "based on the above observations , we consider that the behavior observed for @xmath27 is akin to the lcst phenomenon in thermoresponsive polymers .",

    "hereafter we will be referring to @xmath72 , @xmath27 and @xmath74 , and @xmath73 as low , intermediate and high values , respectively . to further understand the behavior in these three states , we examine the variation of the number of bound solvent beads , @xmath38 , with the temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wa ] , the number of bound solvent is found to be almost independent of @xmath70 for low and high values of @xmath71 , whereas it decreases by increasing the temperature for intermediate values . in fig .",

    "moreover , @xmath38 markedly decreases around @xmath79 which coincides with the temperature around which @xmath69 also decreases ( see fig .",

    "it should be stressed that the change in @xmath69 and @xmath38 with the temperature is observed in our model with minimal interactions as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_simu ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that even when the interaction parameters are independent of the temperature , the temperature dependence of @xmath69 is induced by the bound solvent number @xmath38 for a range of values of @xmath71 .",
    "the above trends in the three different states can be rationalized by considering the different energy , and entropic contributions in the model system .",
    "the attraction between the amphiphilic monomer and the solvent is energetically favorable since it is stronger than the solvent - solvent interaction , leading to a coil - like polymer conformation with many bound solvent beads .",
    "whereas from the viewpoint of entropy , the solvent prefers to be in the bulk state rather than the bound state .",
    "another important contribution is the solvation of solvophobic beads , which is unfavorable as the interaction between the solvophobic bead and the solvent is repulsive .",
    "the interplay of these contributions determines the different states of the polymer chain .",
    "+ concerning intermediate @xmath71 values , the large values of @xmath69 in the coil - like state ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : b ] ) and large @xmath38 at low temperatures ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wb ] ) indicate that the attraction between the amphiphilic monomer and the solvent dominates the entropy loss of the solvent .",
    "hence it is favorable for the solvent to solvate the solvophobic beads despite the repulsive interaction between them . with increase in the temperature ,",
    "the gain in the entropy due to unbinding of the solvent leads to a reduction in the bound solvent content , @xmath38 . in the transition region ( @xmath80 ) ,",
    "there is marked decrease of the bound solvent because the entropy gain of the solvent dominates over the amphiphilic - solvent attraction .",
    "this change in the dominant contribution makes the solvation of solvophobic beads unfavorable , leading to an attraction between the polymeric beads .",
    "such an attraction becomes stronger with the temperature , and drives the transition from the coil - like state to the globule - like state . in fig",

    ", the attraction between the polymeric beads is screened due to the presence of solvent beads . at high temperatures ,",
    "the bound solvent beads unbind due to entropy gain which reduces the screening effect , leading to the collapse of the polymer . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmf_collapsed ] , the increase in the attraction between polymeric beads with temperature is not observed for low @xmath71 values .",
    "+ for low @xmath71 values , both @xmath69 and @xmath38 are small .",
    "this means that at these interaction strengths the entropic gain of the free solvent beads dominates over the interaction between the amphiphilic monomer and the solvent for all the temperatures .",
    "hence the solvation of solvophobic beads is unfavorable in the entire temperature range . on the other hand , for high @xmath71 values ,",
    "both @xmath69 and @xmath38 are large .",
    "this indicates that the attractive interaction is stronger than the entropy loss which leads to the binding of the solvent to the polymer .",
    "hence , the solvation of the solvophobic beads is favored at all temperatures despite the repulsive interaction between the solvophobic monomer and the solvent .",
    "we find from our simulations that the transition from the coil - like state to the globule - like state depends on how much the solvophobic beads can be solvated .",
    "the solvation depends on the interplay between the entropy loss of the bound solvent , and the energetic difference between the bound and the bulk solvent .",
    "the bound solvent is energetically favored as the interaction between the amphiphilic monomer and the solvent is stronger than the solvent - solvent interaction .",
    "therefore two kinds of beads having opposite interactions with the solvent are necessary to exhibit the lcst as long as the interaction parameters are independent of the temperature as in our case .",
    "additionally in our simulation , we did not incorporate any specific chemical or structural details pertaining to the solvent or the polymer chain .",
    "therefore we have demonstrated that the lcst behavior can be exhibited by a coarse grained description of the polymer and the solvent even when the interaction parameters are independent of the temperature .",

    "high @xmath71 values are similar to polymers such as polyacrylamide which are always soluble in water .",
    "this indicates that our coarse - grained model is able to explain the lcst behavior for different systems in the poly(n , n - alkyl , alkyl acrylamide ) family of polymers .",
    "furthermore , the model can also be utilized to study the variation of lcst due to factors such as co - solvents and additives by examining their effect on the two dominant physical interactions namely , the entropy loss of the bound solvent and the mean energy difference between the bound and the bulk solvent .",
    "this aspect will be addressed in our future studies .",
    "the computations were carried out at the high performance computing facility at iit madras .",

    "<S> we study the lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) in thermoresponsive polymer solutions by means of a coarse grained single polymer chain simulation and a theoretical approach . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation model includes solvent explicitly and thus accounts for solvent interactions and entropy directly . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical model consists of a single chain polymer in an implicit solvent where the effect of solvent is included through the intra - polymer solvophobic potential proposed by kolomeisky and widom . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the lcst behavior is determined by the competition between the mean energy difference between the bulk and bound solvent , and the entropy loss due to the bound solvent . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> solvent molecules are bound to the polymer and the solvophobicity of the polymer is screened , resulting in a coiled state . at high temperatures the entropy loss due to bound solvent offsets the energy gain due to binding which causes the solvent molecules to unbind , leading to the collapse of the polymer chain to a globular state . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the coarse grained nature of these models indicates that mean interaction energies are sufficient to explain lcst in comparison to specific solvent structural arrangements . </S>"
