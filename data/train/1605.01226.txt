    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) with cold atoms provides a rich framework to study the wave - particle duality of light and matter @xcite . in this environment",
    ", the interaction of a single photon with a single atom has been brought to a level of control that is sensitive to the finite spatial localization of the atom within the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "this property is at the basis of several protocols , which exploit the optomechanical coupling between atoms and photons in cqed in order to cool the atomic motion @xcite , to perform high precision measurements @xcite , and to create novel sources of quantum light @xcite , to provide some examples .",
    "cavity backaction , moreover , modifies the dynamics to the extent that photons and atoms become strongly correlated : since the photon field depends on the atomic position within the resonator , the mechanical forces that the atom ( or molecule ) experiences depend on the center - of - mass wave function within the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "this nonlinearity is at the basis of several collective phenomena , such as the formation of spatial patterns @xcite , synchronization @xcite , and exotic phases of ultracold matter @xcite . even at the level of a single particle",
    "it can give rise to peculiar behaviours , which shed light on the interplay between nonlinear dynamics and quantum fluctuations .",
    "in this work , we theoretically investigate the regime in which cavity backaction can induce the transition to localization of the atomic center - of - mass wave function .",
    "the system we consider is illustrated in fig.[fig1](a ) : a single atom is tightly confined by an external optical lattice within a high - finesse cavity , its dipole strongly couples with a standing - wave mode of the resonator . in the regime",
    "in which this coupling is dispersive , the mechanical effects of the cavity field are described by a second periodic potential .",
    "we choose the two lattice wavelengths with periods which are incommensurate with each other .",
    "the combination of these two characteristic lengths gives rise to an aperiodic , pseudorandom potential .",
    "in the limit where the cavity nonlinearity can be neglected , the system is described by the aubry - andr model @xcite or the harper model @xcite , which predicts a transition from an extended to a localized phase when the ratio between the depths of the two potentials exceeds a critical value .",
    "this localization transition has been observed experimentally with ultracold atoms confined by bichromatic optical lattices by tuning the amplitude of the secondary lattice potential @xcite .",
    "the effect of interactions on the aubry - andr model has been investigated theoretically both in the mean - field weakly interacting regime @xcite as well as for arbitrary interactions at low lattice filling @xcite .",
    "quasiperiodic potentials have also been realised with exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities @xcite .",
    "differing from these realisations , the strong coupling with the cavity introduces a novel feature : the depth of the cavity potential , in fact , is proportional to the number of intracavity photons , which is a dynamical variable coupling optomechanically with the atomic motion . in this",
    "setting we analyze the localization transition and discuss possible experimental regimes where it could be observed .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in this section we discuss the theoretical model at the basis of our analysis , which is a hubbard model with the onsite energy resulting from a second , incommensurate potential .",
    "we then identify the parameters for which one recovers the aubry - andr @xcite or harper model @xcite .",
    "we further discuss the conditions under which the hubbard model describes a cold atom which opto - mechanically interacts with the mode of a high - finesse optical cavity .      the model at the basis of our analysis results from the one dimensional dynamics of a particle of mass @xmath0 in two periodic potentials , of which one , denoted by @xmath1 , tightly traps the particle at its minima while the second , @xmath2 , is a perturbation to the first potential , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 the canonically - conjugate momentum and position .",
    "the cavity and external potentials are periodic with wave numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is an irrational number .",

    "the hubbard hamiltonian is composed of the hopping term , scaled by the tunneling coefficient @xmath21 , and by the diagonal term in the basis @xmath22 , whose coefficients are the onsite energy @xmath23 and which are site dependent since the hamiltonian is aperiodic . after subtracting an arbitrary energy constant",
    ", we can rewrite these coefficients as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the wannier functions , which are real valued @xcite .    in the aubry - andr model",

    "we analyze the localization transition when the incommensurate potential is given by the function @xmath32 and thus contains several harmonics of the aubry - andr potential , given in equation .",

    "the parameter @xmath43 corresponds to the cooperativity of cqed , which measures the strength of cavity backaction on the atom s scattering properties @xcite .",
    "the strong - coupling regime in cqed is typically characterized by @xmath44 or larger , which is the regime where higher harmonics of the optomechanical potential become relevant .",
    "differing from the aubry - andr model , this is the regime where the model is not self - dual .",
    "in this paper we study the transition to spatial localization .",

    "we characterize the transition by means of the inverse participation ratio @xmath47 @xcite @xmath48 the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) is of the order @xmath49 if the atom spatial wavefunction is uniform over the lattice , whereas it approaches unity when the atom is localized on one single lattice site .",
    "we also monitor the degree of localization by the lyapunov exponent , defined as @xcite @xmath50 according to thouless formula @xcite , in the localized regime of the aubry - andr model it reads @xmath51 with @xmath52 in the case of the original aubry - andr model , i.e. @xmath27 is given by equation , and @xmath53 eq .  . in our calculation",
    "we obtain the lyapunov exponent @xmath54 by fitting the spatial decay of the wavefunction by means of an exponential function .      in this section",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath70 is given by @xmath74 where the first term on right - hand side ( rhs ) is the kinetic energy , the potential @xmath75 is periodic with period @xmath76 and tightly binds the atom at its minima , @xmath77 with @xmath78 the potential depth with the dimensions of an energy .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath79 includes the cavity degrees of freedom and their optomechanical coupling with the atomic motion , and reads @xcite @xmath80 where frequency @xmath81 scales the dynamical stark shift due to the coupling between atom and cavity mode , @xmath82 , with the vacuum rabi frequency @xmath83 , which determines the strength of the coupling between the dipole and one cavity photon . the frequency @xmath81 can be either positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath84 .",
    "the last term on the rhs in eq .",

    "we consider the limit in which there is a time - scale separation between cavity and atomic motion dynamics , and require that the inequality @xmath89 is fulfilled , where @xmath90 is the variance of the atomic momentum , assuming that the cavity linewidth is much larger than the atom doppler broadening @xcite .",
    "we then identify the coarse - grained time scale @xmath91 , which is sufficiently short with respect to the time scale of the atomic external degrees of freedom and yet sufficiently long that during @xmath91 the cavity field reaches a local steady state .",
