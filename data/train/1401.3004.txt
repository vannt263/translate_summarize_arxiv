    "in the recent years effective field theories constructed from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have been enormously successful to describe phenomena where masses and momenta follow certain limits . among them",
    "is non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite which is applicable to a system of two heavy quarks moving with small relative velocity .",
    "next to properties of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 families also the threshold production of top quark pairs is among the prominent examples ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    the common method to construct an effective theory",
    "is based on the so - called matching procedure : appropriately chosen green s functions are computed in the full and effective theory and equality is required up to power - suppressed terms . in this way the couplings of the effective operators ( i.e. the matching coefficients ) are determined which completely specifies the effective theory .",
    "a crucial operator both in qcd and nrqcd is the vector current of a heavy quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the corresponding matching coefficient enters as a building block in a variety of physical observables , for example the bottom - quark mass from @xmath2 sum rules ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent analyses ) and top - quark threshold production at a future electron positron linear collider  @xcite .",
    "the latter process allows for an extraction of the top - quark mass with an accuracy below 100  mev  @xcite  an improvement of about an order of magnitude as compared to the current results from the fermilab tevatron or the the cern large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "several quantities are needed in order to perform a third - order analysis of a heavy quark - antiquark system at threshold .",
    "ultrasoft effects have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , the three - loop static potential has been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite a preliminary analysis of the top - quark threshold production cross section has been presented including also third - order potential effects .",
    "details on the potential contributions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we compute the three - loop matching coefficient between the vector current in qcd and nrqcd .",
    "thus all ingredients are available to obtain the complete next - to - next - to - next - to leading order qcd prediction of the cross section @xmath3 close to threshold or the decay width of the @xmath4 meson to leptons .",
    "the results for the latter are presented in an accompanying paper  @xcite where all building blocks are combined to a phenomenological analysis .",
    "the vector current in the full theory ( qcd ) is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes a generic heavy quark with mass @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand in the effective theory ( nrqcd ) the current is represented by an expansion in @xmath8 where at each order effective operators have to be considered which are multiplied by coefficient functions .",
    "the leading contribution involves one operator given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two - component pauli spinors for quark and anti - quark , respectively , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the pauli matrices .",
    "hence , the matching coefficient of the vector current is defined through @xmath14 note that the 0-component of @xmath15 is only relevant for the power - suppressed contributions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the evaluation of the purely gluonic three - loop corrections to @xmath16 .",
    "the fermionic contributions have already been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to compute @xmath16",

    "@xcite ) @xmath19 where the quantities with a tilde are defined in the effective theory and the ellipsis represents terms suppressed by the heavy - quark mass .",
    "@xmath20 is the renormalization constant of the current @xmath18 which is used to subtract the remaining poles after renormalization .",
    "these poles are due to the separation of long and short distance contributions in the effective theory . in order to evaluate physical quantities",
    "it is important that the same subtraction scheme is also adopted in the contributions originating from the effective theory  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in the full theory the renormalization constant of the vector current is equal to one .    in eq .",

    "this requires the identification of the hard , soft , potential and ultrasoft momentum regions in the integrals contributing to @xmath22 and @xmath26 .",

    "is evaluated for @xmath27 , which corresponds to the leading term of the hard integration region , and @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath29 .    there are several technical difficulties which one has to overcome in order to compute the vertex corrections . among them",
    "are the large number of diagrams which leads to several thousand feynman integrals to be evaluated in the first place , their reduction to a small set of about 100 basis integrals , so - called master integrals , and the evaluation of the latter in an expansion in @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the space - time dimension .",
    "the last two tasks become more complicated by the additional condition @xmath32 on the external momentum .",
    "an automated setup for the calculation has been described in ref .",
