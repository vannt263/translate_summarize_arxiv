    "nowadays consistent efforts in the correct treatment of the beyond mean - field nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations when performing nuclear calculations have been made ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while collective phenomena have been known since the early times of nuclear physics , effects produced by short - range correlations ( src ) are more difficult to be experimentally singled out .",
    "the experimental and theoretical works in the past decade have provided us with a much clearer picture on the consequences of these correlations .",
    "there are clear signatures of the presence of correlation effects on some quantities related to the behaviour of the single nucleon in nuclear medium .",
    "for instance , nn correlations are responsible for the reduction of the spectroscopic strengths of the nuclear hole states @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of this fact requires the knowledge of the removal spectral function which can be represented in a natural way by both overlap functions and single - nucleon spectroscopic factors @xcite .",
    "they are directly related to observable quantities such as @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 reaction cross sections .",
    "the comparison between the theoretically calculated and measured cross sections could serve as a test for the proper account of correlations within the theoretical approach considered .",
    "recently , a general procedure has been adopted @xcite to extract the bound - state overlap functions and the associated spectroscopic factors and separation energies on the base of the ground - state one - body density matrix ( obdm ) .",
    "initially , the procedure has been applied @xcite to a model obdm @xcite accounting for src within the low - order approximation ( loa ) to the jastrow correlation method @xcite .",
    "first , the applicability of the theoretically calculated overlap functions has been tested in the description of the @xmath10o@xmath2 pickup reaction @xcite and of the @xmath11ca@xmath2 reaction @xcite . _",
    "the main result _ from these investigations is that _ absolute cross sections of the @xmath2 reactions are evaluated without any additional normalization in contrast to standard distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) calculations_. then , a detailed study of the cross sections of the electron- and photon - induced knockout reactions on @xmath10o @xcite and @xmath11ca @xcite has been performed .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions are more suitable to test various single - particle ( sp ) overlap functions and nn correlations .",
    "the theoretical results obtained in refs . @xcite reproduce with a fair agreement the shape of the experimental cross sections , in particular at large values of the missing momentum , where correlation effects are more sizable . of course , the general success of the above procedure depends strongly on the availability of realistic one - body density matrices .    in the various approaches ,",

    "the inclusion of short - range and tensor correlations has caused a depletion of the levels below fermi level which is reflected in the substantial reduction of the spectroscopic factors for the quasihole states .    thus having the procedure for calculating such important quantities as the overlap functions and the spectroscopic factors one can apply it to the one - body density matrices of some open @xmath3-@xmath4 shell nuclei . in order to reveal better the nuclear structure properties in this region of nuclei and to draw a parallel with the closed - shell ones , it is desirable to test the resulting overlap functions in calculations of one - nucleon pickup and knockout reactions , which is the aim of the present paper .    in the end of this section",
    "we would like to note that the starting point for the present calculations are obdm s which include src of central jastrow type , and which have been computed by a cluster expansion to leading order in the correlation function .",

    "the inclusion of state - dependent correlations , in particular of tensor ones , is important when modelling transfer reactions . in addition",
    ", long - range correlations also should be taken into account in a consistent way .",
    "on the other hand , we use in our calculations ho single - particle wave functions , which do not have the correct exponential behaviour in the asymptotic region , to construct the obdm .",

    "this imposed the development of a method , though not unique , in @xcite to overcome the difficulties arising from the ho single - particle wave function asymptotics .",
    "the condition for the correct asymptotics is fulfilled in @xcite by using of a sp basis obtained with a woods - saxon potential .",
    "the use of ho wave functions in the present work instead of more realistic woods - saxon ones following the method from @xcite allows us , however , to obtain analytical expressions for the obdm s . at present , no model correlated one - body density matrices treating open @xmath3-@xmath4 shell nuclei are available except that of ref .",
    "@xcite and , therefore , this work should be considered as an initial attempt to study the relative importance of the effects of both src and particular structure of these nuclei on overlap functions , spectroscopic factors and reaction cross sections .",

    "we note that in our work the extracted overlap functions are not separated in respect to the spin - orbit partners @xmath96 . although the obdm s do not allow to obtain different results for @xmath97 and @xmath98 quasihole states , it is useful in some calculations of reaction cross sections for transitions to these states to test the overlap function corresponding to the @xmath19 bound state .",
    "the values of the spectroscopic factors ( sf ) and of the separation energies for neutrons and protons deduced from the calculations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the separation energies ( [ eq : energy ] ) derived from the procedure are in acceptable agreement with the corresponding empirical ones . as a common feature , a substantial reduction of the spectroscopic factors of the states which are below the fermi level ( of the independent - particle picture )",
    "is observed for all nuclei considered due to the short - range nn correlations and their particular open - shell structure . for instance , the values of the sf for the states with @xmath73=0 and @xmath73=2 are much smaller than the values obtained for the @xmath73=1 state .",
    "the particular features of the nuclear structure in the @xmath20-@xmath19 region ( in which the @xmath95 state is not a valence one ) are responsible for the larger reduction of the spectroscopic factors of the levels , though partly occupied , in these open @xmath3-@xmath4 shell nuclei in comparison with the `` more occupied '' @xmath95 quasihole state .",
    "it can be also seen from table 1 that the trend of the calculated sf for proton bound states follows that one corresponding to the neutron overlap functions .",
    "we would like to note the larger reduction of the spectroscopic factors corresponding to quasihole states of the open - shell nuclei considered in comparison with the spectroscopic factors for the states in closed - shell @xmath10o @xcite and @xmath11ca @xcite nuclei when src are taken into account . to discuss this point ,",
    "firstly we give in table 1 the spectroscopic factors for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 quasihole states of the closed - shell @xmath11ca deduced from the one - body density matrix calculations within the same jastrow approach @xcite used in the present work . for comparison ,",
    "the src accounted for within the loa to the jastrow correlation method @xcite produce spectroscopic factors of 0.892 for the @xmath19 state and 0.956 for the @xmath20 in @xmath11ca nucleus .",
    "it turns out that the method from @xcite leads to a suppression of the spectroscopic factors for the closed - shell @xmath11ca nucleus .",
    "the reason for the different sf values could be related to the details of the calculations with the jastrow approach when using the two cluster expansions .",
    "particularly they concern the truncation of the expansions mentioned already in section ii , which causes a different account for the src ( although they are of the same jatrow - type ) , as well as the different asymptotic behaviour of the obdm obtained in both expansions . in our opinion , the mentioned features of the method from @xcite lead to an additional reduction of the values of the sf for open - shell nuclei as well . to support this we would like to note the comparison of both cluster expansions given in @xcite on the example of the nucleon momentum distributions @xmath99 of various nuclei .",
    "the high - momentum tails of @xmath99 obtained using loa @xcite underestimate the corresponding ones obtained with the use of the cluster expansion of clark and co - workers @xcite for the nuclei considered . in this way",
    "the smaller values for the spectroscopic factors derived in the present work within @xcite for both closed- and open - shell nuclei reflect the stronger accounting for the src and can be understood . as a common feature , the spectroscopic factors for the @xmath3-@xmath4 open - shell nuclei are smaller than those for the closed - shell nuclei .",
    "second , in order to check our theoretically calculated spectroscopic factors it is useful to compare them with some single - particle occupation probabilities available for the considered @xmath19-@xmath20 shell nuclei .",
    "the hf calculations performed in @xcite for the @xmath100 scattering analyses treating protons and neutrons equivalently yield values of 0.479 and 0.682 respectively for the @xmath101 fractional occupancies of @xmath5 mg and @xmath6si .",
    "the @xmath102 proton occupancy of 0.67(9 ) derived for @xmath7s was reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 our calculated spectroscopic factors for these states are smaller than the resulting occupancies thus satisfying the general property @xmath103 , i.e. in each @xmath85 subspace the spectroscopic factor @xmath104 is smaller than the largest natural occupation number @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "generally , the values of the spectroscopic factors for open - shell nuclei are influenced by the presence of src accounted for in our obdm similarly to the case of the closed - shell nuclei . however , in our approach an additional reduction of the spectroscopic factors for open @xmath19-@xmath20 shell nuclei takes place because the sf contain themselves a structure information for the non - complete shell occupancy in these nuclei .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the check of the normalization condition for the obdm [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : ovf ] ) ] .",
    "the dwba calculations of the pickup reactions on the considered open - shell nuclei were performed using the dwuck4 code @xcite assuming zero - range approximation for the @xmath13-@xmath72 interaction inside the deuteron .",
    "the same approach has been adopted in previous analyses of @xmath2 reactions on @xmath10o @xcite and @xmath11ca @xcite .",
    "the values of the optical potential parameters have been taken in each case to be the same as in the corresponding standard dwba calculations .",

    "no extra spectroscopic factor is needed , since our overlap functions already include the associated spectroscopic factors . in the examples of some reactions",
    "the standard dwba form factor is also able to reproduce the shape of cross sections , while the uncorrelated wave functions fail to describe correctly neither the size nor the shape of the angular distributions .",
    "the differences between the three types of calculations are observed mostly at larger angles where the curves corresponding to the uncorrelated case overestimate substantially the experimental data .",
    "thus , the relevant importance of src included in our approach becomes clear for a correct description of pickup processes and this makes it possible to conclude that the replacement of the overlap integral by a single - particle wave function is a rough approximation .",

    "the overlap function is replaced by a sp wave function corresponding to a given mean - field potential . in such calculations",
    "the nn correlations are included approximately by adjusting the mean - field potential parameter values .",
    "another reason for the observed discrepancies in @xcite is that a spherical potential has been used for generating the bound neutron state in dwba instead of a more realistic deformed one .",
    "we would like to mention here _ the principal role of the overlap function for the good description of the differential cross section _ for the transition to the ground @xmath112 state in @xmath113 mg .",
    "it is obtained on the basis of a correlated obdm and allows one to account for the short - range correlations in the case of pickup reaction .",
    "the results of the calculations carried out additionally for the transitions to the excited states are less satisfactory for angles larger than 10 degrees .",
    "one of the reasons for this is the unrealistic ( ho ) asymptotic behaviour of the jastrow - type obdm @xcite which has been used to calculate the overlap functions following the method described in section ii . concerning the similarity of the shape of the theoretical curves ( though different by one order of magnitude ) in the upper and middle panels of fig .",

    "it can be noted that the choice of the radius of the real part of the deuteron optical potential within the interval from 0.65 fm to 0.95 fm ( considered in the standard dwba analyses ) does not influence strongly the good overall agreement of the cross sections obtained by means of the theoretically calculated overlap function with the experimental data .",
    "apart from the shown sensitivity of the calculations to the deuteron optical potential , in general , we should mention that the @xmath2 reaction is more sensitive to the reaction mechanism adopted than to the choice of the bound - state wave function .",

    "it turned out from the previous analyzes of one - nucleon removal reactions @xcite that the quasifree nucleon knockout is more suitable to investigate the role of overlap functions as bound - state wave functions .",
    "an example of electron - induced proton knockout from @xmath7s for the transition to the ground @xmath102 state of @xmath122p is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : eeps ] .",
    "calculations have been done with the code dweepy @xcite , which is based on the nonrelativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) description of the nucleon knockout process and includes final - state interactions and coulomb distortion of the electron waves @xcite . the latter has been treated with a high - energy expansion in inverse powers of the electron energy @xcite . in the figure the result obtained with the proton overlap function for the @xmath20 state of @xmath7s and the optical potential from @xcite",
    "is compared with the nikhef data from @xcite . a reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the reduced cross section",
    "is obtained . in the analysis of @xcite",
    "the calculations are performed within the same dwia framework and with the same optical potential , but a phenomenological single - particle wave function is used with a radius adjusted to the data .",
    "_ we emphasize that in the present work the overlap function is theoretically calculated on the basis of the jastrow - type obdm of @xmath7s and does not contain any free parameters_. it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eeps ] that our spectroscopic factor of 0.5648 gives a good agreement with the size of the experimental cross section and , in addition , it is in accordance with the integrated strength for the valence @xmath102 shell in @xmath7s @xcite which amounts to 65(7)% of the sp strength obtained using the shell - model bound - state function .",
    "the result for the @xmath7s@xmath8 cross section obtained with the harmonic - oscillator bound - state wave function is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eeps ] .",
    "it has been computed with the same oscillator parameter value @xmath127=2 fm for the @xmath102 ground - state wave function as in the original calculations of the obdm without src @xcite . in order to perform a consistent comparison with the result when",
    "considering theoretically calculated overlap function , we have applied the same spectroscopic factor of 0.5648 . in this case",
    ", the size of the reduced cross section is also reproduced , but the ho wave function gives much worse description of the experimental data .",
    "thus , the comparison made in fig .",
    "[ fig : eeps ] shows the important role of the src accounted for in our approach for the correct description of knockout reactions .",
    "we have performed also calculations for the transition to the excited @xmath101 state at @xmath114=2.234 mev and have found a good agreement with the shape of the experimental momentum distribution . in our opinion , however , the comparison for the @xmath19 states is not very meaningful since our approach can not discriminate between the @xmath98 and @xmath97 states and the proton overlap function is calculated for the @xmath19 state . from the experimental point of view , it is noted in @xcite that it is also impossible to distinguish strengths originating from both @xmath19 shells for the integrated @xmath55 strength . in this sense ,",
    "our spectroscopic factor of 0.6636 fits well the integrated spectroscopic strength in the @xmath19 shell up to 24 mev excitation energy ( the value 6.04(60 ) from table 5 in @xcite ) thus representing a depletion of about 60% of the full @xmath19 shell .",
    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows : i ) single - particle overlap functions , spectroscopic factors and separation energies are calculated from the jastrow - type one - body density matrices , which were derived using factor cluster expansion , for the ground state of the open - shell @xmath5 mg , @xmath6si and @xmath7s nuclei .",
    "ii ) taking into account both short - range correlations and specific nuclear structure it is found that the deduced spectroscopic factors @xmath104 of the hole states of open - shell nuclei in our particular jastrow approach are substantially smaller than those of the closed - shell ones satisfying at the same time the general relation with the natural occupation probabilities @xmath128 , namely @xmath103 .",
    "iii ) the absolute values of the differential cross sections of @xmath2 reactions on @xmath5 mg , @xmath6si and @xmath7s as well as of @xmath7s@xmath8 reduced cross section are calculated by using the theoretically obtained overlap functions which already contain nn correlations .",
    "the acceptable agreement with the experimental data shows that this method is applicable also to the case of open - shell nuclei .",
    "the description of the cross sections might be improved including the deformation effects in the even - even @xmath16=@xmath15 nuclei in the @xmath20-@xmath19 region .",
    "iv ) using more realistic obdm s with a correct asymptotic behaviour one can expect that the resulting overlap functions will be able to describe more accurately the experimental cross sections of the one - nucleon removal reactions on open @xmath3-@xmath4 shell nuclei . in this case more definite conclusions about the role of the src in open- and closed - shell nuclei can be drawn .",
