    "@xmath8 is the dominant higgs decay mode in a wide mass range , and for masses between @xmath9 and @xmath10 the branching ratio is close to the unity .",
    "sm higgs in this mass range is mainly produced via two mechanisms , gluon fusion , in which case no hard jet activity is expected ; and vector - boson fusion , characterized by 2 forward jets , opposite in rapidity , with high mass .",
    "the leptonic final states of the w bosons , electrons or muons , give clear signature of the higgs boson .",
    "the signal , @xmath11 , presents two leptons in the final state , with opposite charge and small opening angle ; and a significant missing transverse energy ( @xmath12 ) , due to the undetected neutrinos .",
    "as no mass peak can be reconstructed , in this analysis the background control is very important .",
    "the sources of possible background are multi - lepton final states , specially final states with @xmath12 : di - boson production , especially @xmath7 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , drell - yan and @xmath15 .",
    "when compared with the signal , the cross - sections of the backgrounds are much larger .",
    "the amount of signal events recorded by the @xmath16 experiment will depend on the trigger efficiency . a global @xmath17 between different hlt sequences ( _ trigger - paths _ ) is chosen to maximize the signal detection efficiency .",
    "the trigger - paths taken into consideration require either a single lepton ( electron or muon with loose isolation requirements ) or double leptons ( electrons , muons or a combination without isolation requirements ) and they have high efficiency at luminosities in the range @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "standard @xmath16 lepton reconstruction techniques are used .",
    "the effective selection of @xmath4 and @xmath5 show high efficiency for true isolated leptons coming from @xmath1 boson decays , while at the same time effectively suppressing leptons from heavy quark decays or fake leptons produced by other objects .",
    "we use a tight identification criteria for electrons due to the large @xmath15 background , based on the matching of a charged track reconstructed in the central tracker with a supercluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "muon candidates are identified by matching a track reconstructed in the muon detectors with a track reconstructed in the central tracker  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "events are required to have exactly two leptons with opposite electric charge sign , @xmath21 , @xmath22 10 , 20 gev , and isolated ( with tracks and in the calorimeter ) . if more than two leptons fulfill the requirements , the event is rejected to reduce @xmath23 and @xmath24 contamination .",
    "no hard jet activity in the central region is expected for signal , which can be used against @xmath13 background as shown in figure  [ jacpic2-f1 ] .",
    "jets are reconstructed using iterative cone algorithm with @xmath26 = 0.5 .",
    "if an event contains any jet with @xmath27 15 gev and @xmath28 2.5 , it is rejected .",
    "the application of a jet veto is also useful against : @xmath14 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath15 backgrounds .",
    "significant @xmath12 is expected due to the neutrinos in the final state , and is computed from the raw calorimeter tower energies , applying a correction due to the presence of muons .",
    "the @xmath12 cut is specially useful against drell - yan background after the invariant mass cut .      to optimize the signal event selection against the main backgrounds",
    "the following variables are used :    * * angle between the leptons in the transverse plane @xmath31 * : for @xmath7 events this angle is expected to be large , for the scalar @xmath32 higgs boson this angle tends to be small due to spin correlations . * * invariant mass of the lepton pair @xmath33 * : an upper cut is applied in the case of @xmath34 , @xmath35 final states to reduce the contamination by leptons coming from z - boson decays . *",
    "* transverse momenta of the harder ( @xmath36 ) and the softer ( @xmath37 ) lepton * : upper / lower limit applied in order to reduce the background further .",
    "the distribution of the invariant mass @xmath33 and the opening angle @xmath38 is shown in figure  [ jacpic2-f2 ] for the @xmath39 higgs boson signal and for the main background in the @xmath40 channel .",
    "the analysis is split in three complementary topologies according to the considered final states , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . a first analysis based on sequential cuts",
    "was performed and then a multivariate approach was also made .",
    "the first part of the analysis is common for all the final states and consist in the application of the * skimming * ( to reduce data and select potentially interesting events ) and the * pre - selection * ( to define common objects of the analysis -such as leptons or jets- and also to select events ) .",
    "then , each final state applies its own cuts to select events , due to the experimental differences in the identification of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and also because some background processes do not equally affect all the final states .",
    "after the * jet veto * , the cuts on the sensible variables ( * @xmath12 * , * @xmath44 * , * invariant mass * and the * @xmath45 of the leptons * ) are applied . at the end",
    ", the results for the three final states are combined to improve @xmath16 discovery potential .",
    "the conclusion of the physics @xmath46  @xcite was that the @xmath32 higgs boson could be discovered in the @xmath47 channel with less than @xmath48 if its mass is around 165 gev . a new analysis taking fully into into account the understanding of the detector and",
    "the control of experimental and background systematics expected for intergrated luminosities up to 1 fb@xmath49 has been performed and progress towards a complete and realistic event strategy is obtained"
