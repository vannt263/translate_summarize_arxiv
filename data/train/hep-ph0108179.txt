    "the numerical values for the single transverse - spin asymmetry in drell - yan lepton angular distribution are small , which is consistent with the fact that the single transverse - spin asymmetries are a twist-3 effect . for any inclusive observables , like the drell - yan cross section discussed here ,",
    "the asymmetries should be of the order of @xmath153 with @xmath7 being the energy exchange of the collisions .",
    "however , the single transverse - spin asymmetries can be large for observables at certain phase space where the twist-2 contributions are steeply falling , and the twist-3 contributions get a kinematic enhancement due to the derivative term @xcite",
    ".    we would like to contrast our small asymmetry estimates with those of ref.@xcite , which find large asymmetry values based on their model and its parameters fitted to the pion production asymmetries .",
    "a future measurement of the size of the asymmetry can therefore clearly distinguish between the model predictions of @xcite ( asymmetries between 20% and 40% for the whole @xmath154 range ) and the estimates presented here .    in conclusion , we have calculated the single transverse - spin asymmetry for the drell - yan lepton - pair s angular distribution in perturbative qcd .",
    "we found that our result at leading order in the strong coupling constant , given in eq .",
    "( [ bq - an - full ] ) , is consistent with what was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , but different from what was found in ref .",
    "we derived our result in both color light - cone and covariant gauges while keeping explicit electromagnetic current conservation . with a model of the twist-3 correlation function ,",
    "our calculated asymmetry predicts both the sign and magnitude of the asymmetry .",
