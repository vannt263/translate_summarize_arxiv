    "the field of extrasolar planetary transits is one of the most productive and innovative subject in astrophysics in the last decade .",
    "transit observations can be used to measure the size of planets , their orbital parameters @xcite , stellar properties @xcite , to study the atmospheres of planets @xcite , to detect small planets @xcite , and exomoons @xcite . in particular , the study of planetary atmospheres requires a high level of photometric precision , i.e. one part in @xmath010@xmath1 in stellar flux @xcite , which is comparable to the effects of current instrumental systematics and stellar activity @xcite , hence the necessity of testable methods for data detrending . in some cases , different assumptions , e.g. using different instrumental information or functional forms to describe them , leaded to controversial results",
    "even from the same datasets ; examples in the literature are @xcite for the hot - jupiter hd189733b , and @xcite for the warm - neptune gj436b .",
    "some of these controversies are based on spitzer / irac datasets at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath2 m .",
    "the main systematic effect for these two channels is an almost regular undulation with period @xmath03000 s , so called pixel - phase effect , as it is correlated with the relative position of the source centroid with respect to a pixel center @xcite .",
    "conventional parametric techniques correct for this effect dividing the measured flux by a polynomial function of the coordinates of the photometric centroid ; some variants may include time - dependence ( e.g. @xcite ) . newer techniques attempt to map the intra - pixel variability at a fine - scale level , e.g. adopting spatial weighting functions @xcite or interpolating grids @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with these methods appear to be strongly dependent on a few assumptions , e.g. the degree of the polynomial adopted , the photometric technique , the centroid determination , calibrating instrument systematics over the out - of - transit only or the whole observation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also , the very same method , applied to different observations of the same system , often leads to significantly different results .",
    "non - parametric methods have been proposed to guarantee an higher degree of objectivity @xcite .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath2 m spitzer / irac primary transits of hd189733b and gj436b obtained during the cryogenic regime , so called `` cold spitzer '' era , adopting a blind source separation technique , based on an independent component analysis ( ica ) of individual pixel time series , in this paper called `` pixel - ica '' . the results obtained with this method are repeatable over different epochs , and a photometric precision of one part in @xmath010@xmath1 in stellar flux is achieved , with no signs of significant stellar variability as suggested in the previous literature @xcite .",
    "the use of ica to decorrelate the transit signals from astrophysical and instrumental noise , in spectrophotometric observations , has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the reason to prefer such blind detrending methods is twofold : they require very little , if any , prior knowledge of the instrument systematics and astrophysical signals , therefore they also ensure a higher degree of objectivity compared to methods based on approximate instrument systematics models . as an added value ,",
    "they give stable results over several datasets , also in those cases where more conventional methods have been unsuccessful .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a different pixel - level decorrelation method ( pld ) that uses pixel time series to correct for the pixel - phase effect , while simultaneously modeling the astrophysical signals and possible detector sensitivity variability in a parametric way .",
    "pld has been applied to some spitzer / irac eclipses and synthetic spitzer data , showing better performances compared to previously published detrending methods .    in this paper , we test the pixel - ica detrending algorithm over simulated datasets , for which instrumental systematic effects are fully under control , to understand better its advantages and limits . in particular",
    ", we :    1 .   consider some toy - models that can reproduce systematic effects similar to those seen in spitzer / irac data ; 2 .",
    "test the pixel - ica method on simulated datasets ; 3 .",
    "explore the limits of its applicability ; 4 .",
    "compare its performances with the most common parametric method , based on division by a polynomial function of the centroid ( pcd ) , and the semi - parametric pld method .",
    "ica is a statistical technique that transforms a set of signals into an equivalent set of maximally independent components .",
    "it is widely used in a lot of different contexts , e.g. neuroscience , econometrics , photography , and astrophysics , to separate the source signals present in a set of observations / recordings @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption is that real signals are linear mixtures of independent source signals .",
    "the validity of this assumption for astrophysical observations has been discussed with more details in @xcite ( app . a ) .",
    "the major strenghts of this approach are :    1 .",
    "it requires the minimal amount of prior information ; 2 .",
    "even if the assumption is not valid , the method is able to detrend in part the source signals .",
    "if additional information is available , some variants of ica can be used to obtain better results @xcite , but these are not considered in this paper .",
    "pixel - ica method uses individual pixel time series from an array to decorrelate the transit signal in photometric observations of stars with a transiting planet .",
    "the main steps are :    1 .",
    "ica transformation of the time series to get the independent components ; 2 .",
    "identification of the transit component , by inspection or other methods ( e.g. @xcite ) ; 3 .",
    "fitting of the non - transit components plus a constant on the out - of - transit of the integral light - curve ( sum over the pixel array ) ; 4 .",
    "subtraction of the non - transit components , with coefficients determined by the fitting , from the integral light - curve ; 5 .   normalization of the detrended light - curve .",
    "the normalized , detrended light - curve is model - fitted with @xcite , which depends on several stellar and orbital parameters .",
    "we typically perform a nelder - mead optimisation algorithm @xcite to obtain first estimates of the best parameters of the model , then we generate monte carlo chains of 20,000 elements to sample the posterior distributions ( approximately gaussians ) of the parameters .",
    "the updated best parameters are the mean values of the chains , and the zero - order error bars , @xmath3 , are their standard deviations .",
    "the zero - order error bars only accounts for the scatter in the detrended light - curve ; they must be increased by a factor that includes the uncertainties due to the detrending process : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the final parameter error bar , @xmath6 is the square root of the likelihood s variance ( approximately equal to the standard deviation of residuals ) , and @xmath7 is a term associated to the detrending process .",
    "@xcite suggest the following formula for @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the so - called interference - to - signal - ratio matrix , @xmath10 are the coefficients of the non - transit - components , @xmath11 is their number , @xmath12 is the standard deviation of residuals from the theoretical raw light - curve , out of the transit , @xmath13 is the normalising factor for the detrended light - curve .",
    "the sum on the left takes into account the precision of the components extracted by the algorithm ; @xmath12 indicates how well the linear combination of components approximates the out - of - transit .",
    "the multicombi code , i.e. the algorithm that we use for the ica transformation , provides two interference - to - signal - ratio matrices , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , associated to the sub - algorithms efica and wasobi , respectively .",
    "two approaches has been suggested to derive a single interference - to - signal - ratio matrix : @xmath16 @xmath17 eq . [ eqn : israve ] is a worst - case estimate , while eq .",
    "[ eqn : isrmin ] takes into account the outperforming separation capabilities of multicombi compared to efica and wasobi .",
    "we adopt eq .",
    "[ eqn : isrmin ] throughout this paper , but results obtained with both options are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab7 ] , [ tab8 ] , [ tab9 ] , and [ tab10 ] . in most cases",
    "the differences are negligible .",
    "we consider an _ ideal _ transit light - curve with parameters reported in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , sampled at 8.4 s over 4@xmath18 hr , totaling 2001 data points , symmetric with respect to the transit minimum .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the ideal light - curve . to each data point",
    "we associate a number of photons proportional to the expected flux , in particular 50,000 photons in the out - of - transit .",
    "we generate random gaussian coordinates for each photon , representing their positions on the plane of the ccd .",
    "finally , we add a grid on this plane : each square of the grid represents a pixel , and the number of photons into a square at a time is the read of an individual pixel in absence of pixel systematics . to simulate the effect of instrumental jitter",
    ", we move the gridlines from one data point to another ( it is equivalent to shift the coordinates of the photons ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the jitter effect at different levels , i.e. individual pixels , and small and large clusters .",
    "pixel flux variations are related to the changing position of the psf : the flux is higher when the centre of the psf is closer to the centre of the pixel .",
    "the same is valid for the flux integrated over a small aperture , compared to the width of the psf .",
    "also note that short time scale fluctuations are present as a sampling effect .",
    "neither of these variations are observed with a large aperture that includes all the photons at any time .      in a real case scenario ,",
    "the detected photons from the astrophysical source are distributed according to a poissonian function with fluctuations proportional to the square root of the expected number of photons .",
    "the value of the proportionality factor is specific to the instrument .",
    "poisson noise in the source is a natural limitation to the photometric precision that can be achieved for any astrophysical target . to include this effect in simulations",
    ", we added a random time series to the astrophysical model , multiplied by different scaling factors , then generated frames with total number of photons determined by those noisy models .",
    "spitzer / irac datasets for channels 1 and 2 show temporal flux variations correlated to the centroid position , independently from the aperture selected @xcite . here",
    "we consider two effects that , combined to the instrument jitter , can produce this phenomenon :    1 .",
    "inter - pixel quantum efficiency variations , simulated multiplying the photons in a pixel by a coefficient to get the read , being the coefficients not identical for all the pixels ; 2 .",
    "intra - pixel sensitivity variations , simulated by assigning individual coefficients dependent on the position of the photon into the pixel .",
    "we performed simulations for two values of ( gaussian ) psf widths , @xmath26 :    * @xmath271 p.u .",
    "( pixel side units ) ; * @xmath270.2 p.u .",
    "the two sets of frames differ only in the scaling factor in photon coordinates , therefore no relative differences are attributable to random generation processes . as a comparison ,",
    "the nominal psf widths for spitzer / irac channels are in the range 0.6 - 0.8 p.u .",
    "@xcite . by comparing two more extreme cases , we observe the impact of the psf width on pixel systematics and their detrending .",
    "we also tested eleven poisson noise amplitudes , linearly spaced between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "+ we simulated several jitter time series as detailed in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for each case",
    ", we adopted :    1 .   a random generated quantum efficiency map with standard deviations of @xmath010@xmath30 , to simulate the inter - pixel variations ; 2 .   a non - uniform response function for each pixel , i.e. 1@xmath310.1@xmath32 , where @xmath32 is the distance from the centre of the pixel , to simulate the intra - pixel variations .",
    "these values are of the same order as the nominal pixel - to - pixel accuracy of flat - fielding and sub - pixel response for spitzer / irac channels 1 and 2 @xcite , but slightly larger to better visualize their effects .",
    "finally , we add white noise time series at an arbitrary level of 5 counts / pixel / data point for most cases , to simulate high - frequency pixel noise ( hfpn ) .",
    "it is worth to note that the same quantum efficiency maps and noise time series have been adopted for all the simulations with pixel arrays of the same size , to minimize possible aleatory effects when comparing the results .",

    "in general , the best option is to check whether the two approaches lead to the same results , and if not , to investigate the origin of the discrepancy .    a variant of the original pixel - ica algorithm consists in fitting the independent components plus a transit model to the raw light - curves ( see appendix c.5 in @xcite ) .",

    "intra - pixel effects can not be totally detrended by any of the three methods , but pixel - ica , in most cases , outperforms pcd method , which is largely case - dependent .",
    "also , pixel - ica method provides consistent results within the error bars .",
    "it is possible to fit the astrophysical signal after detrending or together with the other components .",
    "the only differences are registered if at least one of the non - transit components has a similar shape at the time of transit , in which case the first approach is preferable , but the two results were consistent within 1@xmath48 .",
    "the pld method , updated to include cross - term between pixel fluctuations and the astrophysical signals , lead to very similar results than pixel - ica , particularly if the astrophysical signal is fitted together with the other components .    in conclusion , we have found in a variety of simulated cases that pixel - ica performs as well or better than other methods used in the literature , in particular polynomial centroid corrections and pixel - level decorrelation @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of pixel - ica over other methods relies on its purely statistical foundation without the need of imposing prior knowledge on the instrument systematics , therefore avoiding a potential source of error .",
