    "an open question in astrophysics is related to the origin and acceleration mechanisms of the ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "their extreme energy ( @xmath0 ) poses a problem for simple models of particle acceleration .",
    "measurements by the pierre auger observatory favor a mixed composition at energies @xmath1 , which becomes increasingly heavier with energy  @xcite .",
    "the recent combined spectrum - composition fit by the auger collaboration also suggests a mixed composition at the sources  @xcite , although the results are model - dependent .",
    "a difficulty common to many uhecr acceleration models concerns the efficiency at which a source accelerates heavy nuclei .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , for example , are inefficient , as opposed to unipolar inductors operating in pulsars and magnetars . outflows of active galactic nuclei are also seemingly suitable accelerator sites , although the abundance of nuclei such as iron is low .",
    "tidal disruption events ( tdes ) by supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have been suggested as the underlying mechanism for particle acceleration to ultra - high energies  @xcite , and invoked to explain anisotropy results by the pierre auger observatory and telescope array  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on a different kind of tde in which a white dwarf ( wd ) is disrupted by an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "imbhs provide a natural link between stellar - mass and supermassive black holes .",
    "they are found in dwarf galaxies , with an occupation fraction for active imbhs of order 1% in both x - ray  @xcite and optical surveys  @xcite , as well as in the nearest massive globular cluster  @xcite .",
    "a substantial number of agns in dwarf galaxies may be missed because of soft x - ray absorption  @xcite .",
    "we infer that quiescent imbhs are likely to occur in at least 10% of observed dwarfs as well as in massive globular clusters , and moreover are plausibly expected to be produced in many of the failed dwarfs predicted by galaxy formation theory in the context of the @xmath2cdm model , if only as relic building blocks of smbhs  @xcite .",
    "the typical imbh mass lies in the range between those of stellar mass and supermassive black holes , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "wds are the end product of main - sequence stars with masses up to @xmath4 due to the abundance of wds , in dense environments they are prone to collide and/or merge with other objects . in some cases ,",
    "wds can be disrupted by imbhs and explode as supernovae .",
    "the observation of the gamma - ray burst grb060218 and its associated supernova , sn2006aj  @xcite , has been interpreted by @xcite as such an encounter . a similar interpretation for the object",
    "swift j1644 + 57 has also been suggested by @xcite .",
    "if a star of mass @xmath5 is close to a black hole of mass @xmath6 , tidal forces may deform the star , stretching it along the orbital direction and squeezing it in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the net effect of this deformation is an increase in pressure which may be enough to trigger nuclear burn , causing the explosion of the star as a low - luminosity supernova  @xcite . as suggested by @xcite",
    ", this can happen for white dwarfs with masses between @xmath7 and @xmath8 that are not able to normally burn helium but which can be ignited by tidal disruptions .",
    "similarly , for stars of @xmath9 , tidal disruption events can trigger the burning of carbon and oxygen , the composition of white dwarfs in this mass range .",
    "stars can be tidally - disrupted by bhs if their distance to this object is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the stellar radius .",
    "let @xmath12 be the pericenter distance between the star and the black hole .",
    "the encounter strength ( @xmath13 ) is usually defined as the ratio between the tidal radius @xmath14 and the pericenter distance @xmath12 .",
    "the schwarzschild radius of the black hole is @xmath15 , thus constraining the maximum mass of a black hole for which the star can be tidally - disrupted , which is  @xcite @xmath16 typically for wds @xmath17 and @xmath18 , implying @xmath19 .",
    "this explains why smbhs with masses @xmath20 can not tidally disrupt white dwarfs",
    ".    once ignited the star will unavoidably become a supernova .",
    "the relative abundances of elements synthesized by white dwarfs in tidally - induced supernovae events will be used to fix the initial composition of uhecrs in our model . naturally , these abundances depend upon the initial composition of the star .",
    "low - mass wds ( @xmath21 ) are mainly composed of helium , whereas the ones with masses @xmath22 have as their primary composition intermediate - mass nuclei such as carbon and oxygen .",
    "we now introduce two simple models : + _ model i _ :",
    "wds with masses @xmath23 are composed initially of helium ; + _ model ii _ : wds with masses @xmath24 are composed initially of equal amounts of carbon and oxygen . +",
    "these models are based on results of numerical calculations by @xcite .",
    "the relative abundances are summarized in table  [ tab : abundances ] .",
    "model i is for a helium wd of @xmath25 disrupted by a black hole of @xmath26 , whereas model ii is for a carbon / oxygen wd of @xmath27 encountering a black hole of @xmath28 .",
    "the mass of the black hole and white dwarf , as well as the proximity of the encounter , are expected to affect the relative abundances of each element , so that tab .",
    "[ tab : abundances ] is intended to be a representative case rather than an exact model .",

    "debris of the explosion of the star will be accreted onto the bh at a rate @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the characteristic time for bound material to fall into the black hole , given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a model - dependent parameter , and @xmath40 designates the deformation factor for a spread @xmath41 . combining equations",
    "[ eq : accretionrate ] and [ eq : fbtime ] we can write @xmath42 , which reads @xmath43 note that the accretion rate decays with @xmath44 .",
    "this is believed to be a universal property of tidal disruption events  @xcite .",
    "as the material from the supernova explosion falls into the black hole , part of the magnetic field of the former star is advected toward the event horizon , increasing the total magnetic energy in the vicinities of the black hole , which is @xmath45 the magnetic field @xmath46 is composed of a turbulent random component arising from magnetorotational instability  @xcite , and the regular ( poloidal ) component generated via dynamo amplification of seed fields  @xcite .",
    "these fields can reach values as high as @xmath47  @xcite , which is so high that it can only be maintained during a short period of time . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the field goes back to its former value @xmath49 .    in eq .",
    "[ eq : fbtime ] there is a @xmath50 dependence , which was found to be constant in studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these differences , however , do not invalidate our results .",
    "it would cause a change of one order of magnitude in the estimates of eq .",
    "[ eq : bbh ] for @xmath51 , and a factor of a few for @xmath52 .",
    "we now assume that this is a kerr black hole and that energy can be extracted from the black hole s rotation via the blandford - znajek mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this letter to describe this mechanism ; for details the reader can refer to e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the jet is launched due to the presence of a poloidal magnetic field , as shown in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the energy budget available for particle acceleration is obtained assuming the equipartition argument . following  @xcite , for an orbital radius of @xmath53",
    ", we can write the poynting flux as @xmath54 note that for a typical binary system composed of a white dwarf and an imbh with mass @xmath55 , assuming @xmath56 and a region about the size of the schwarschild radius @xmath57 , then @xmath58 .",
    "for an accelerator region of size @xmath57 , using the hillas criterion , the maximal energy attainable by the accelerated uhecrs , in terms of the black hole mass , is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the atomic number of the cosmic - ray nucleus , and @xmath61 its lorentz factor , with @xmath62 being the opening angle of the jet .",
    "curvature losses and synchrotron emission will degrade the total energy by a factor of up to 10 .",
    "note that typically @xmath63 for this kind of process , hence cosmic - ray protons can be easily accelerated up to energies @xmath64 .",
    "tidal disruption events produce gravitational waves with amplitudes @xmath65 , which can be more conveniently expressed as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the distance of the source .",
    "the frequency of the signal is approximately @xmath68    therefore , for a typical wd of @xmath69 and @xmath70 located outside our galaxy at @xmath71 tidally - pinched by a black hole of @xmath72 , the gravitational - wave signal would have amplitude @xmath73 and frequency @xmath74",
    ". because these values are in the low - frequency region , at the limit of advanced ligo s sensitivity  @xcite , close encounters between wds and imbhs may not be detectable by the current generation of gravitational - wave detectors unless they are exceptionally close ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "nevertheless , with further enhancements in the detector and by combining the gravitational - wave measurements with neutrino and electromagnetic counterparts , detection might be possible .",
    "the rate of imbh - wd encounters is @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "not all imbh - wd disruptions will lead to supernovae , but up to @xmath77 of them will .",
    "auger has derived lower bounds on the density of sources based on the absence of clustering in the arrival directions of uhecrs ; the least stringent bound is @xmath78 and the most stringent @xmath79 , at 95% confidence level , depending on how sources are distributed and on the strength of extragalactic magnetic fields  @xcite . under the simple assumption that the rate of imbh - wd encounters is constant over time",
    ", we obtain a density @xmath80 averaged over a hubble time .",
    "even if we assume that these events started occurring only in the last @xmath81 years , @xmath82 would still be compatible with the auger bound .",
    "from table  [ tab : abundances ] we can fix the uhecr composition . as a proxy for the composition , we use here two observables : the depth of the maximum of the air shower ( @xmath83 ) and its standard deviation ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "therefore , the only free parameters of the model are the spectral index of the injected cosmic rays ( @xmath85 ) , and the maximum rigidity to which they are accelerated ( @xmath86 ) .    in order to illustrate the predictions made by the model ,",
    "we compute the expected spectrum and composition by simulating the propagation of uhecrs from the sources to earth . assuming that the sources are uniformly spaced in the comoving volume",
    ", we simulate the propagation of uhecrs using the crpropa 3 code  @xcite .",
    "we consider all relevant interactions and energy loss processes , namely : photopion production , pair production , photodisintegration , nuclear decay , and adiabatic losses due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "the main target for interactions are the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "in particular , we use the ebl model by @xcite .",
    "the simulations use as input the fraction of each nuclear species following table  [ tab : abundances ] .",
    "the spectrum has the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the relative abundance of each nucleus of atomic number @xmath60 , @xmath89 is the overall normalization factor , and the function @xmath90 is 1 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 otherwise . the results are shown in fig .  [ fig : speccomp ] for both models . in order to obtain @xmath83 , and @xmath84",
    "we have used the parametrization given by @xcite , assuming the hadronic interaction model epos - lhc  @xcite for the development of cosmic - ray showers in the atmosphere .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : speccomp ] we concern ourselves with neither the spectral index nor maximal rigidity of sources in our model , and the chosen combination of parameters is merely for illustration purposes .",
    "spectrum and composition should be simultenously constrained as done by @xcite . nevertheless , due to the many uncertainties involved in such combined fit , whose evaluations are beyond the scope of this work , we simply present a few combinations of the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath85 , whilst arbitrarily fixing the normalization for the spectrum at 30 eev .",
    "although we extend the analysis down to @xmath93 , our model was devised to hold for @xmath1 , since this is the energy at which the galactic and extragalactic components of the cosmic - ray spectrum overlap , according to some models  @xcite .",
    "one can clearly see that a few combinations of @xmath85 and @xmath86 lead to good agreement between measurements and simulations for individual observables . nevertheless , it is fairly difficult to find a scenario that satisfactorily describes all three observables considered ( spectrum @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ) . moreover , the measurements are subject to systematic uncertainties not displayed in the figures , which are @xmath94 for @xmath83 , and @xmath95 for @xmath84 .",
    "these predictions are subject to uncertainties related both to the propagation of uhecrs from their sources to earth and to the relative abundance of each element synthesized in the supernova .",
    "the latter has been discussed by @xcite and is inherent to the modelling of the explosion .",
    "the former depends on parameters such as the exact distribution of sources , photonuclear cross sections , and the ebl model adopted , as shown by @xcite . moreover",
    ", magnetic fields may also play a role in the spectral shape , although to which extent is uncertain .",
    "we have described the acceleration of cosmic rays to ultra - high energies by invoking the blandford - znajek mechanism . however , this is not essential in order for the model described here to work .",
    "acceleration may take place in a number of different ways .",
    "for instance , the well - known fermi shock acceleration by the supernova explosion could operate in combination with other mechanisms .",
    "acceleration could also occur in the polar caps of black holes , provided that its poloidal magnetic field is not parallel to the axis of rotation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , acceleration mechanisms similar to those of magnetars  @xcite and young pulsars  @xcite could be viable .",
    "our results qualitatively hold for any mechanism wherein particles are electromagnetically accelerated , i.e , rigidity - dependent scenarios , which is the case of the vast majority of uhecr acceleration models",
    ". an exception would be the baados - silk - west mechanism  @xcite , which predicts that particles colliding in the near - horizon vicinity of a sufficiently rapidly - rotating black hole could be accelerated up to extremely high energies via angular momentum transfer .",
    "promising environments to search for imbh - wd systems are globular clusters .",
    "globular clusters are abundant in the universe and even in the milky way .",
    "about 10% of all stars disrupted in globular clusters are white dwarfs . moreover ,",
    "n - body simulations by @xcite suggest that one in every ten of these clusters contain imbhs .",
    "other interesting candidates are dwarf galaxies , as they may host imbhs that are possibly required to seed the formation of supermassive black holes  @xcite .",
    "the large number of relic dwarfs expected in cdm - motivated galaxy formation models provides a potentially rich source of imbhs that have been proposed to play an important role in determining the milky way galaxy s baryon fraction  @xcite .",
    "moreover the inefficient formation of the central smbh by merging imbhs should leave a significant population of surviving imbhs  @xcite .",
    "the milky way may consequently harbor imbhs in regions where wds are fairly abundant .",
    "therefore , one can expect a few imbh - wd encounters within our galaxy contributing to the observed uhecr spectrum .",
    "a possible tracer of imbh - wd tidal disruption events are ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , whose luminosities ( @xmath96 ) exceed those of any stellar process known .",
    "@xcite has interpreted the x - ray flare from grb060218 as such an event . in particular",
    ", the observation of an associated supernova ( sn2006aj ) strengthens this interpretation .",
    "detailed numerical simulations of imbh - wd encounters could be used to improve the estimates of the composition of the exploding star , thus fixing the composition of uhecrs in the neighborhood of sources .",
    "electromagnetic , neutrino , and gravitational - wave counterparts of such events could provide a way to test acceleration models in imbh - wd systems . nevertheless ,",
    "because tidal ignition of wds by imbhs are transient events , we do not expect to see uhecrs in coincidence with photons , neutrinos , and gravitational waves , since time delays would be incurred by intervening magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , if some types of nuclei remain confined within the source , the observed composition of uhecrs would not be explained by this model . in general because of the short time - scale and higher luminosities of white dwarf tde events  @xcite , they are expected to be prominent in flux - limited transient surveys  @xcite .",
