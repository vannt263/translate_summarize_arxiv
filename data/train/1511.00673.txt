    "our methods use diffusive processes on graphs as a simple means to link features of the directed network and propagation dynamics . while diffusive flow is a simplification of the actual propagation in the nervous system of _ c.  elegans _ , we can still gain insight into network properties of dynamical interest  @xcite .",
    "we exploit these ideas in two ways .",
    "firstly , we investigate flow - based partitions of the connectome across multiple scales using the markov stability ( ms ) framework for community detection  @xcite .",
    "our analysis detects subgroups of neurons that retain diffusive flows over particular time scales  @xcite taking into account edge directionality  @xcite .",
    "we then mimic neuronal ablations computationally , and check _ all _ possible single and double ablations in the connectome to detect those that are most disruptive of the flow organisation . secondly , we extract alternative information of the directed network flows through the role based similarity ( rbs ) framework  @xcite . without pre - imposing categories _ a priori _ , rbs classifies neurons into flow roles , i.e. , classes of neurons with similar asymmetric patterns of incoming and outgoing network flows at all scales , which are directly extracted from the network .",

    "conceptually , ms can be understood as follows .",
    "imagine that a drop of ink ( signal ) is placed on a node and begins to diffuse along the edges of the graph .",
    "if the graph lacks structural organisation ( e.g. , random ) , the ink diffuses isotropically and rapidly reaches its stationary distribution .",
    "however , the graph might contain subgraphs in which the flow is trapped for longer than expected , before diffusing out towards stationarity .",
    "these groups of nodes constitute dynamical , flow - retaining communities in the graph , usually signifying a strong dynamic coherence within the group and a weaker coherence with the rest of the network .",
    "if we allow the ink to diffuse just for a short time , then only small communities are detected , for the diffusion can not explore the whole extent of the network .",
    "if we observe the process for a longer time , the ink reaches larger parts of the network , and the flow communities thus become larger . by employing dynamics , and in particular by scanning across time",

    "it was found that command interneurons ( e.g. ava , avb , avd , pvc ) play the role of global hubs , whereas d - type motor neurons play the role of provincial hubs  @xcite .",
    "these features are in line with our ablation results , where d - type motor neuron ablations alter flows at finer scales and ablation of interneurons modifies flow patterns at larger scales . indeed , the concept of community role is closer to our ablation results , in that we measure there the disruption of flow - based communities .",

    "this distinction between neurons with upstream and downstream roles is also an inherent characteristic in the rbs analysis , yet from a different perspective , i.e. , based on the global characteristics of a node with respect to the in- and out - flows in the network , rather than based on its local connections .    to quantify the differences between the groupings into roles obtained by these different methods ,",
