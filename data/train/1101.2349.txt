    "p.  scheglov worked on increasing angular resolution of ground - based telescopes , realizing that the sensitivity to faint objects depends on the resolution as much as on the telescope diameter .",
    "he considered this to be a huge and poorly used resource of ground - based astronomy .",
    "he approached the problem from multiple sides .",
    "* select astronomical sites with best natural seeing .",
    "* study the man - made seeing in domes and telescopes , determine optimum parameters of astronomical domes ( height , ventillation regime ) . *",
    "interact with the optical industry to help build telescopes of high optical quality .",
    "p.s . had a strong interest in optical testing and telescope technology .",
    "* develop electronic and photographic detectors to approach the photon sensitivity limits .",
    "p.s . was a pioneer of using image intensifiers in astronomy .",
    "* increase the resolution by post - processing ( image sharpening ) and interferometry .",
    "p.s . was among the first to recognize and advocate the potential of speckle interferometry and long - baseline interferometers .",
    "p.s . tried to actively promote these ideas by presenting them at various colloquia and meetings , publishing review papers , russian translations of textbooks and proceedings on detectors and large telescopes of the future and , finally , writing his own books on new astronomical techniques .",

    "p.  scheglov teached at the moscow university .",
    "his course on experimental astronomy largely contributed to the education of many currently active researchers .",
    "he was the phd advisor of several graduate students working on site testing : s.  novikov , a.  guryanov , v.  kornilov , a.  tokovinin , a.  kutyrev , yu .",
    "he has influenced the whole generation of astronomers in the former republics of the soviet union .",
    "p.v . scheglov ( sheglov , shcheglov ) published about 50 papers on site testing , some are listed below ."
