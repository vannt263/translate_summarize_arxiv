    "a tonks - girardeau gas @xcite is a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of identical bosons with strong interparticle interactions .",
    "the wave functions of the bosons have a surprisingly simple one - to - one mapping to a system of non - interacting fermions @xcite . in recent years",
    ", a tonks - girardeau gas was realized in experiments with ultracold gases @xcite .",
    "a characteristic property of the tonks - girardeau gas is that the probability to find two particles at the same position is very small @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies of the tonks - girardeau gas so far dealt only with the case of elastic interactions . in a recent experiment , we studied a 1d gas in which the bosons strongly interact inelastically , leading to loss of particles @xcite .",
    "this system also shows a strong suppression of the probability to find two particles at the same position and , indeed , demonstrates an alternative way of realizing a tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "the broader impact of this experiment lies in the demonstration that dissipation can be used to drive a system into the strongly - correlated regime .    here",
    "we study the theory of the dissipative tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "we show that in the limit of infinite interaction strength girardeau s solution @xcite is reached , as in the case of strong elastic interactions . we derive a markovian master equation that describes the dissipation in the system and yields a rate equation for the particle loss .",
    "when the study is restricted to loss rates at short times , the master equation can be reduced to a schrdinger equation with a non - hermitian version of the lieb - liniger hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this approach yields an analytic expression for the loss rate in the limit of strong dissipation .",
    "furthermore , we present numerical solutions to the dissipative lieb - liniger model at finite interaction strength that illustrate how a possible elastic part of the interactions becomes irrelevant as the dissipation strength diverges . in addition",
    "these numerical calculations reveal the dependence of the pair correlation function on dissipation strength , showing that an increase in the dissipation strength leads to a decrease of the actual loss rate due to the build - up of strong correlations",
    ". finally , we present an estimate for the loss rate at longer times .",
    "in this section , we discuss a master equation approach to describe loss processes caused by inelastic two - body collisions in an ultracold gas .",
    "first , we introduce the master equation , then use it to derive a rate equation for the particle loss , and finally show that in the short - time limit , a non - hermitian lieb - liniger model is obtained .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) , dilute , ultracold gas of identical bosons , which all occupy the same internal state .",
    "two - body collisions in such a gas can be described in terms of the 3d @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 . for elastic collisions ,",
    "it is customary to replace the interparticle scattering potential by a delta potential @xmath2 with interaction strength @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of a particle . for the many - body system in second quantization",

    "( [ h-0 ] ) has no effect .",
    "we now generalize this treatment to include inelastic collisions .",
    "first , we consider inelastic collisions on the level of a two - body problem .",
    "this yields an imaginary part of the scattering length , with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this is because the elastically scattered wave is proportional to the diagonal element of the @xmath11-matrix @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wave vector in the relative motion .",
    "hence , a negative imaginary part of @xmath1 reduces the elastically scattered flux .",
    "this missing flux appears in the inelastically scattered channels .",
    "next , we consider the effect of inelastic collisions on the level of the many - body system .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath9 defined by eq .",
    "( [ g-3d ] ) becomes complex - valued .",
    "equation ( [ h-0 ] ) contains only the real part of @xmath9 and thus represents only the elastic part of the interactions ( see appendix [ app - master ] ) . for a treatment of the inelastic collisions , it is crucial what happens to the collision partners after the collision .",
    "the difference in internal energy that is released in the change of the internal state appears in the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the particles after the collision . in typical experiments with trapped ultracold gases ,",
    "the energy released here is so large that all particles involved in the collision quickly escape from the trap .",
    "this loss of particles is an irreversible process . in appendix",
    "[ app - master ] , we derive a markovian quantum master equation @xmath14 + { \\cal d}(\\rho)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath15 of this many - body system , with a dissipator @xmath16 that has a lindblad form @xcite .",
    "the dissipator describes loss of pairs of particles due to inelastic collisions .",
    "more specifically , the last two terms in @xmath17 deplete terms in the density matrix that represent states with more than one particle .",

    "if we are interested only in calculating @xmath50 at short times , @xmath51 , we can use this observation to drastically simplify the model .",
    "the key idea is that refilling population into states with @xmath49 particles is important only when the evolution at long times is considered , namely at times where states with @xmath49 particles also decay significantly .",
    "but at short times , all that counts is how fast population is lost from the initial state .    guided by this idea",

    "the imaginary part of an energy eigenvalue @xmath61 is always non - positive and represents the initial loss rate of the particle number .",

    "e.g. _ , in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for real @xmath79",
    ", two characteristic properties can be used to distinguish between bound and gaseous states : first , the momenta of all particles are real valued for gaseous states , whereas at least one momentum is complex for bound states .",
    "second , for @xmath80 all momenta converge to finite values for gaseous states , whereas at least one momentum diverges to @xmath81 for bound states .",
    "we consider the case of complex @xmath79 , where all momenta are usually complex so that the first characteristic property becomes useless , but the second one remains useful , namely the convergence or divergence of the momenta for @xmath67 can still be used to distinguish between gaseous and bound states .",
    "this distinction implies that @xmath70 and @xmath82 remain finite for @xmath83 for all gaseous states .",

    "yet another way to obtain eq .",
    "( [ psi - vanishes ] ) is to consider a right eigenvector of the effective hamiltonian @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath87 for at least one relative coordinate @xmath88 , then eq .  ( [ h - ll ] ) shows that @xmath89 , so that the state decays with infinite speed .",
    "we decompose @xmath90 and see that after any nonzero time only those eigenstates with finite @xmath91 survive . again , this yields eq .  ( [ psi - vanishes ] ) .",
    "the other states are bound states .",
    "they vanish immediately and no longer contribute to the state or to the dynamics of the system .    in the limit @xmath67 ,",
    "the interaction for all gaseous states is fully described by the boundary condition ( [ psi - vanishes ] ) .",
    "the crucial point is that this boundary condition is independent of whether @xmath79 is real or complex , and it is precisely this boundary condition that yields a tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "hence , the wave functions of all gaseous states turn exactly into girardeau s solutions @xcite in the limit @xmath67 , irrespective of whether @xmath79 is real or complex . attraction , repulsion , and dissipation all produce the tonks - girardeau gas in the limit of infinite interaction strength .",
    "the above discussion shows that an initially uncorrelated state subject to strong dissipation will experience a rapid initial decay .",
    "some fraction of the population will survive and this remaining population will be in the tonks - girardeau subspace , where the loss is slow",
    ". the loss will prevent the system from subsequently moving far away from the tonks - girardeau subspace .",
    "this freezing of the population can be understood intuitively with an analogy from classical optics @xcite or as a manifestation of the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",

    "a solid proof of completeness for complex @xmath79 is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
