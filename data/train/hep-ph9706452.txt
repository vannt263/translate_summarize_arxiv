    "= 20 pt charmonium suppression due to debye screening in a deconfined medium was proposed in 1986 by matsui and satz @xcite and found experimentally by the na38 collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , it was claimed very soon @xcite that this phenomenon , which is also present in @xmath1 collisions , could be due to the absorption of the pre - resonant @xmath2 pair in the colliding nuclei .",
    "it is nowadays known @xcite that the data on @xmath1 and on @xmath3 collisions with a light projectile can indeed be described by nuclear absorption with an absorptive cross - section @xmath4 mb @xcite .",
    "recently the na50 collaboration has found an anomalous @xmath0 suppression in @xmath5 collisions , i.e. a suppression which is substantially stronger than the one obtained from nuclear absorption with the above value of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "two different interpretations of this anomalous suppression have been proposed in the literature .",
    "one is a conventional hadronic interpretation in which there is an extra @xmath0 suppression due to final state interaction of the resonant @xmath0 state with co - moving hadrons @xcite .",
    "the other interpretation @xcite assumes that when the local hadronic energy density is larger than some critical value ( taken to be around the one reached in a central @xmath7 collision ) , there is a discontinuity in the @xmath0 survival probability .",
    "( see also @xcite for ideas based on percolation of strings . )",
    "nuclear absorption is present in all interpretations . we describe it in the probabilistic model of ref .",
    "let us consider first proton - nucleus collisions . in this model ,",
    "the pre - resonant @xmath2 pair is produced at some point @xmath8 inside the nucleus and scatters with nuclei on its path at @xmath9 , with an absorptive cross - section @xmath6 .",
    "this produces a change in the @xmath10 dependence of the @xmath0 inclusive cross - section . for nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "this change is given @xcite by    s^abs(b , s ) = [ 1 - ( - a  t_a(s )  _ abs ) ] [ 1 - ( - bt_b(b - s )  _ abs ) ] ab  t_a(s )  t_b(b - s ) _",
    "[ 1e ]    here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the nuclear profile functions , determined from a standard saxon - woods density , and @xmath6 is the absorptive cross - section . in the following we take @xmath4 mb which gives the best fit to the @xmath1 data @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath13 for @xmath14",
    ". expression ( [ 1e ] ) has the meaning of a survival probability of the @xmath0 due to nuclear absorption .",
    "since we are aiming at a quantitative analysis it should be emphasized that the probabilistic formula , with its longitudinal ordering in @xmath8 , can only be true in the low energy limit .",
    "therefore it is important to evaluate the uncertainty resulting from using this formula at @xmath15 gev . in a recent paper @xcite the equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) has been derived in a field theoretical approach .",
    "the obtained formula is valid at all energies and coincides exactly with ( [ 1e ] ) in the low energy limit . in the asymptotic limit we find @xcite s _ ^abs(b , s ) = , [ 2e ]    where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 total cross - section . at asymptotic energies , the results obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) and ( [ 2e ] ) differ only by 8 @xmath18 .",
    "it is amazing that at @xmath19 20 gev the difference between the result obtained with the exact formula , valid at all energies , and the one obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) is less than 1 @xmath18 .",
    "the anomalous @xmath0 suppression observed by the na50 collaboration in @xmath5 collisions came as a surprise . indeed",
    ", it was believed that the energy densities in @xmath7 and @xmath5 collisions were comparable - the larger energies reached in @xmath5 being compensated by a larger interaction transverse area .",
    "however , it was soon realized that the local energy density ( i.e. the energy per unit of transverse area @xmath20 ) is larger by about 30 @xmath18 in central @xmath5 than in central @xmath7 collisions @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let us consider the well known geometrical factors @xcite    m_a(b)(b , s ) = a(b )  t_a(b)(s ) .",
    "[ 3e ]    the average number of participants is obtained as        where    n_w(b , s ) = m_a(b , s ) + m_b(b , b - s ) .",
    "[ 5e ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) is taken as a measure of the energy per unit transverse area at each impact parameter .",
    "it is found @xcite that the maximum value reached in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath21 is @xmath22 3.3 @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can then be formulated as follows : for @xmath24 , one assumes nuclear absorption alone with a standard value of @xmath6 ( see section 2 ) . for @xmath25 ,",
    "one puts @xmath26 , i.e. one assumes that none of the @xmath0 s produced in this hot region can survive .",
    "this model gives the maximal suppression that can be obtained in @xmath5 collisions when one imposes that , up to central @xmath7 collisions , there is only nuclear absorption .",
    "the interesting result is that with this simple model one approximately obtains the suppression observed experimentally in central @xmath5 collisions . in ref .",
    "@xcite a more detailed analysis of the data has been performed in a similar framework .",
    "more precisely , instead of the local energy density @xmath27 , the authors of ref . @xcite consider the quantity    ( b , s ) = n_c ( b , s ) n_w ( b , s )  , [ 6e ]    where n_c(b , s ) = ab  t_a(s )  t_b(b - s ) _ pp  .",
    "[ 7e ]    the quantity ( [ 6e ] ) gives the average number of collisions per participant at fixed @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it increases with the centrality of the collision .",
    "the value of @xmath30 determines the onset of deconfinement in ref . @xcite .",
    "more precisely , at a given impact parameter @xmath28 , the absorptive cross - section is assumed to be infinite for @xmath30 larger than some critical value @xmath31 , while for @xmath32 it takes the standard value @xmath4 mb discussed in section 2 . actually in ref .",
    "@xcite one has two distinct values of @xmath31 .",
    "one is for @xmath33 s and is taken to be equal to the maximum value of @xmath34 in a central @xmath7 collision , i.e.    ^_c = _ su 2.3  .",
    "[ 8e ]    the second one is for direct @xmath0 and is taken as a free parameter satisfying @xmath35 .",
    "the overall @xmath0 survival probability is then obtained by combining 40  @xmath18 @xmath33 suppression with 60  @xmath18 suppression of direct @xmath0 .    in this way a reasonable description of @xmath0 suppression is obtained .",
    "the results for @xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    finally in ref . @xcite",
    "one combines nuclear absorption , deconfinement and absorption by co - movers ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the quantity which determines the onset of deconfinement depends not only on @xmath28 and @xmath29 but also on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath8 . when some critical value of this quantity is reached the involved cross - sections present a discontinuity but their values remain finite .",
    "the survival probability of the @xmath0 due to absorption with co - moving hadrons is given by ( see @xcite and references therein )    s^co(b , s ) = .",
    "[ 9e ]    here @xmath36 is the density of hadrons per unit transverse area @xmath20 and per unit rapidity at impact parameter @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath37 is the density at freeze - out that we take to be universal .",
    "the argument of the log is the interaction time of the @xmath0 with co - moving hadrons .",
    "the @xmath38-function is numerically irrelevant ( see section  5 ) .",
    "@xmath39 is the co - mover cross - section properly averaged over the momenta of the colliding particles ( the relative velocity of the latter is included in its definition ) .",
    "we treat @xmath39 as a free parameter @xcite .",
    "all species of hadrons are included in @xmath40 .",
    "this quantity has been computed in the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite .",
    "it is expressed as a linear combination of the geometrical quantities defined in eqs .",
    "( [ 5e ] ) and ( [ 7e ] ) @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the effects of the co - movers in proton - nucleus collisions turn out to be negligeably small ( see section 5 ) .    the inclusive cross - section for @xmath0 production in nuclear collisions is then given by    i_ab^(b ) = i_nn^ _ pp d^2s  n_c(b , s ) s^abs(b , s )  s^co(b , s ) , [ 10e ]    where @xmath43 is given by ( [ 7e ] ) .",
    "we see that for drell - yan pair production ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 .",
    "we take @xmath46 mb .",
    "the results @xcite are presented for three sets of parameters .",
    "set i : @xmath47 7.3  mb , @xmath48 0 ; set ii : @xmath47 6.7 mb , @xmath48 0.6 mb , @xmath49 1.15 @xmath23 ; and set iii : @xmath50 7.3 mb , @xmath39 = 1.0 mb , @xmath49 2.5 @xmath23 .",
    "the results for @xmath0 suppression versus @xmath3 are presented in fig .",
    "3 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the ratio @xmath0 over dy versus @xmath51 and in fig .  5 we show the same ratio versus @xmath52 .",
    "this variable , defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , is a measure of the centrality of the collision .",
    "we see that nuclear absorption alone ( set i ) fails very badly , whereas sets ii and iii give a reasonable description of the data .",
    "let us first discuss the role of the @xmath38-function in eq .",
    "( [ 9e ] ) .",
    "this function looks like a discontinuity in the co - mover contribution .",
    "however , numerically it has practically no effect in our results for @xmath7 and @xmath5 collisions - especially with the parameters of set ii . indeed , the value @xmath53 @xmath23 in this set ( which is the same used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is just the average density of co - movers in @xmath54 ( given by @xmath55 dn / dy$ ] ) .",
    "therefore the argument of the log is always larger than one ( except for values of the integration variables where the argument of the exponent is very close to zero ) and the @xmath38-function is irrelevant . with eq .",
    "( [ 9e ] ) , the effect of co - movers is rather small in @xmath7 ( see figs . 3 and 4 ) and negligeable in @xmath1 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a different expression for the argument of the log was introduced . using it in eq.([9e ] ) for @xmath3 collisions",
    "our results are practically unchanged .",
    "however , the effect of the co - movers in @xmath1 , although small , is then non - negligeable . when discussing the @xmath56 ratio this effect can be compensated by a decrease of @xmath6 .",
    "however , an effect is left in the ratio @xmath57 , which will decrease by roughly 10  @xmath18 between @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "there is a rather general consensus that ( most of ) the observed @xmath59 suppression in @xmath7 and @xmath5 collisions is due to co - mover interactions .",
    "even the authors @xcite , who strongly support the deconfinement scenario for @xmath0 suppression , do interpret in that way the @xmath59 over drell - yan ratio in all systems ( including @xmath5 ) .",
    "let me discuss this ratio within set  ii . here",
    "the value of @xmath37 is the same used in ref . @xcite and the analysis therein is essentially unchanged in our approach .",
    "more precisely , in @xmath1 collisions this ratio is constant both in ref .",
    "@xcite and in our formalism ( eq .",
    "( [ 9e ] ) ) . in @xmath7 collisions",
    "one can choose the value of @xmath60 such as to reproduce @xcite the ratio @xmath61 .",
    "in the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite one then gets a good description of @xmath5 using this value of @xmath62 . in our case ,",
    "the value for the last bin of @xmath5 is too small .",
    "however , this discrepancy is at the level of two standard deviations , and , therefore , one has to wait for better data and @xmath63 . ] .",
    "let me discuss now the effect of deconfinement on @xmath59 suppression . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that deconfinement produces a sharp decrease of the ratio @xmath57 at the critical value of the @xmath59 deconfining phase transitions ( taken to be the same as for @xmath33 s , eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) ) . at the time ref .",
    "@xcite was published , it was assumed that this deconfinement would take place after @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the decrease of the ratio @xmath57 observed in @xmath7 was regarded as a qualitative success of the phase transition scenario .",
    "nowadays , we know that this phase transition can only take place after the last @xmath51 bin of @xmath7 ( eq .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) ) .",
    "no sharp decrease of the @xmath57 ratio is observed here .",
    "therefore the experimental behaviour of the ratio @xmath57 ( or @xmath61 ) does not confirm the qualitative expectations of the phase transition scenario .",
    "perturbative qcd calculations yield a very small value of the co - mover cross - section , i.e. of the cross - section of a bound @xmath0 with hadrons near threshold @xcite .",
    "when non - perturbative effects are introduced , a much larger value is obtained @xcite . in order to settle this important question kharzeev and satz",
    "have proposed to measure the @xmath0 suppression in @xmath1 collisions in the backward hemisphere ( or @xmath10 on @xmath64 in the forward one ) .",
    "when the @xmath0 is slow in the rest system of the nucleus it will be produced inside the nucleus and if its interaction cross - section is very small there will be no @xmath0 suppression .",
    "the problem , however , is that it may be experimentally very difficult to distinguish a cross - section of , say , less than 0.1 mb @xcite from the moderate values ( 0.5 to 1.5 mb ) needed in the co - mover scenario .",
    "perhaps a more interesting possibility would be to consider @xmath7 in the backward hemisphere ( or @xmath65 on @xmath66 in the forward one ) .",
    "indeed , in the co - mover scenario the decrease of the absorptive cross - section discussed above may be over - compensated by an increase of absorption due to an increase of the density of co - movers when one moves in rapidity towards the maximum of @xmath67 .",
    "the observation of a maximum in the @xmath0 suppression at this value of @xmath68 would support the co - mover scenario .",
    "a further advantage of this proposal is that it can be done in the rapidity range @xmath69 ) covered by the present na50 experimental set up .",
    "the calculation of this effect is , of course , possible in the co - mover scenario but it requires a hypothesis on the energy dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the observation of such a maximum does not rule out the phase transition scenario .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 environment at @xmath70 in @xmath7 ( or at @xmath71 in @xmath72 ) is hotter than the one in @xmath7 at @xmath73 , and therefore deconfinement can be present there .",
    "this shows that the geometrical criteria for deconfinement used in refs .",
    "@xcite can only be appropriate for a flat rapidity density of hadrons . when this is not the case the critical value of the local energy density has to be a function of @xmath68 .",
    "it also shows the difficulty to disentangle the co - mover scenario from the deconfining one .",
    "the main difference between color deconfinement and co - mover absorption is the presence in the former of a sudden change in the @xmath0 survival probability , whereas all changes are smooth in the latter .",
    "however , this discontinuity is assumed to take place in a variable ( the local energy density ) which is not directly observable .    as for the number of free parameters , in the deconfinement approach of ref .",
    "@xcite there is ( apart from @xmath6 which is present in all approaches ) only the value of @xmath74 ( the critical value of the local energy density ) .",
    "moreover , one has chosen a value of @xmath26 above the critical density . in ref .",
    "@xcite there is an extra parameter since one takes two distinct critical values for @xmath33 s and for direct @xmath0 deconfinement .    in the co - mover scenario",
    "there are two free parameters : @xmath39 and @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) dependence in @xmath5 is controlled by both quantities .",
    "however , we see in figs . 3 , 4 and 5 that changing @xmath37 by a factor 2 has very little effect on the results , since this change is compensated by a corresponding change in the value of @xmath39 .",
    "because the effects of these two parameters are strongly correlated , it is not possible in the simple co - mover approach of refs .",
    "@xcite to reproduce the structure in the @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) dependence of the @xmath5 data .",
    "taking a mixture of @xmath33 s and direct @xmath0 with distinct parameters , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , would improve the situation .",
    "however , one should make sure that such a structure is not due to a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the success of the co - mover model is due to the fact that , when a couple ( @xmath75 ) is chosen in such a way to reproduce the @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) dependence in @xmath5 , the corresponding effect of the co - movers in @xmath7 turns out to be rather small and does not spoil the success of the nuclear absorption model .",
    "moreover , the dependence on centrality of the local density of co - movers is stronger in @xmath5 than in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "this produces the change in the @xmath52 slope between the two systems , seen in fig .",
    "5 .    in conclusion , to distinguish the deconfinement scenario involving a phase transition ( or discontinuity ) from the co - mover scenario turns out to be a quantitative rather than a qualitative issue .",
    "the present data can be reasonably well described in both approaches with a comparable ( and small ) number of free parameters .",
    "so far no experiment has been suggested which would allow to disentangle these two mechanisms",
