    "it is well known that the geometrical and topological effects play a central role in a large number of physical problems .",
    "they have important implications on all scales , from subnuclear to cosmological .",
    "in particular , in quantum field theory the properties of the vacuum crucially depend on the both geometry and topology of the background spacetime . in the present paper we consider combined effects of the geometry and topology on the vacuum current densities induced by magnetic flux tubes . as a background geometry we consider de sitter ( ds ) spacetime and the topological effects",
    "are induced by two types of sources .",
    "the first one will correspond to a planar angle deficit due to the presence of a cosmic string and the second one comes from the compactification of the spatial dimension along the cosmic string .",
    "the cosmic strings are among the most important types of topological defects that may have been formed by the phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "though the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation have ruled out them as the primary source for primordial density perturbations , the cosmic strings give rise to a number of interesting physical effects such as the doubling images of distant objects or even gravitational lensing , the emission of gravitational waves and the generation of high - energy cosmic rays ( see , for instance , damo00 ) .",
    "recent developments on the formation of topological defects in superstring theories have led to a renewed interest in cosmic ( super)strings . in particular , a variant of their formation mechanism has been proposed in the framework of brane inflation @xcite .",
    "string - like defects also appear in a number of condensed matter systems , including liquid crystals and graphene - made structures .    in the simplest theoretical model ,",
    "the cosmic string is described by a planar angle deficit with the background geometry being locally flat except on the top of the string where it has a delta shaped curvature tensor .",
    "the corresponding non - trivial topology induces nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for physical observables .",
    "specifically , the vev of the energy - momentum tensor associated with various fields has been developed by many authors @xcite-@xcite . moreover , considering a magnetic flux running along the strings , there appear additional contributions to the corresponding vacuum polarization effects for charged fields @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the presence of a magnetic flux induces also vacuum current densities .",
    "this phenomenon was analyzed for massless sira and massive @xcite scalar fields .",
    "it has been shown that an azimuthal vacuum current appears if the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one has a nonzero fractional part .",
    "the analysis of the induced fermionic currents in higher - dimensional cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a magnetic flux have been developed in @xcite .",
    "the fermionic current induced by a magnetic flux in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional conical spacetime and in the presence of a circular boundary has also been analyzed @xcite .    in general , the analysis of quantum effects for matter fields in a cosmic string spacetime , consider this defect in a flat background geometry .",
    "for a cosmic string in a curved background , quantum effects associated with a scalar field have been discussed in @xcite for special values of the planar angle deficit .",
    "the vacuum polarization in schwarzschild space - time threaded by an infinite straight cosmic string is investigated in otte10 . in recent publications",
    "we have investigated the vacuum polarization effects for massive scalar @xcite and fermionic beze10 fields , induced by a cosmic string in ds spacetime .",
    "it has been shown that for massive quantum fields the background gravitational field essentially changes the behavior of the vacuum densities at distances from the string larger than the ds curvature radius , when compared with the case of the string in minkowski spacetime .",
    "depending on the specific value of the mass , at large distances two regimes are realized with monotonic and oscillatory behavior of the vevs .",
    "similar analysis for vacuum polarization effects , induced by a cosmic string in anti - de sitter spacetime , have been developed in @xcite and @xcite for massive scalar and fermionic fields , respectively .",
    "the choice of ds spacetime as the background geometry in the present paper is motivated by several reasons .",
    "first of all , this spacetime is a maximally symmetric solution of the einstein equation in the presence of a positive cosmological constant and , as a consequence of high degree of symmetry , a large number of physical problems are exactly solvable on its background .",
    "as it will be shown below , this is the case for the problem under consideration .",
    "the importance of ds spacetime as a gravitational background has essentially increased after the appearance of the inflationary scenario for the expansion of the universe at early stages .",
    "most versions of this scenario assume a period of quasiexponential expansion in which the geometry of the universe is approximated by a portion of ds spacetime .",
    "this gives a natural solution to a number of problems in standard cosmology .",
    "in addition , the quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field during the inflationary epoch generate inhomogeneities that are seeds for the formation of the large scale cosmic structures .",
    "more recently , astronomical observations of high - redshift supernovae , galaxy clusters , and the cosmic microwave background have indicated that at present the universe is accelerating and can be well approximated by the friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological model with the energy dominated by a positive cosmological constant - type source .",
    "if the universe is going to accelerate forever , this model will lead asymptotically to a ds spacetime as a future attractor for the dynamics of the universe .",
    "the second type of the topological effects we shall consider here is induced by the compactification of the spatial dimension along the cosmic string axis .",
    "the compact spatial dimensions are an inherent feature of most high - energy theories of fundamental physics , including supergravity and superstring theories .",
    "an interesting application of the field theoretical models with compact dimensions recently appeared in nanophysics .",
    "the long - wavelength description of the electronic states in graphene can be formulated in terms of the dirac - like theory in three - dimensional spacetime with the fermi velocity playing the role of speed of light ( see , e.g. , cast09 ) . in graphene - made structures , like cylindrical and toroidal carbon nanotubes ,",
    "the background geometry for the corresponding field theory contains one or two compact dimensions . in quantum field theory ,",
    "the periodicity conditions imposed on the field operator along compact dimensions modify the spectrum for the normal modes and as a result of this the vevs of physical observables are changed . recently",
    "the analysis of the induced fermionic current and the vev of the energy - momentum tensor in a compactified cosmic string spacetime in the presence of magnetic flux running along the string , have been developed in @xcite .",
    "the vev of the fermionic current in spacetimes with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions and in the presence of a constant gauge has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the combined effects of topology and the gravitational field on the vevs of the current density for charged scalar and fermionic fields in the background of ds spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions is considered in @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature effects on the current densities for scalar and fermionic fields in topologically nontrivial spaces have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the background geometry and construct the complete set of normalized positive- and negative - energy fermionic mode functions obeying a quasiperiodic boundary condition with an arbitrary phase along the string axis .",
    "in addition , we assume the presence of a constant gauge field . in section [ sec3 ] , by using the mode - summation method ,",
    "we first show that the vevs for the charge density and the radial current vanish .",
    "then we evaluate the renormalized vev of the azimuthal current density induced by a magnetic flux running along the string axis .",
    "it is decomposed into two parts : the first one corresponds to the geometry of a cosmic string in ds spacetime without compactification and the second one is induced by the compactification of the spatial dimension parallel to the string .",
    "the vev of the axial current density is investigated in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "this vev is a purely topological effect induced by the compactification and vanishes in the geometry of a straight cosmic string .",

    "the azimuthal current is an odd periodic function of the magnetic flux along the string axis with the period equal to the flux quantum .",
    "it depends on the radial and conformal time coordinates through the ratio @xmath147 , which is the proper distance from the string measured in units of the ds curvature scale @xmath149 .",
    "near the string , the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath193 is independent of the mass and it behaves as the inverse forth power of the proper distance . in this limit",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the modes with small wavelengths and the effects of the curvature are small . for a massive field ,",
    "the influence of the gravitational field on the vacuum current density is crucial at distances from the string larger than the curvature radius of the background spacetime . in this limit",
    ", corresponding to @xmath175 , the azimuthal current density exhibits a damping oscillatory behavior with the amplitude inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance .",
    "note that for the string in minkowski spacetime and for a massive field , at large distances the current is exponentially suppressed .",

    "this part vanishes on the string for @xmath195 , is finite for @xmath196 and diverges for @xmath115 . in the opposite limit of large distances from the string ,",
    "the behavior of the azimuthal current density for a compactified cosmic string depends crucially on whether the parameter @xmath197 , defined by ( [ abet2 ] ) , is zero or not . for @xmath198 and @xmath199 , the leading term in the asymptotic expansion",
    "is given by ( [ j2far ] ) and the azimuthal current is suppressed by the factor @xmath200 with with @xmath201 . for @xmath202",

    "at large distances from the string the effects of the planar angle deficit and of the magnetic flux on the axial current are small and to the leading order we recover the result for ds spacetime with a single compact dimension , described by ( [ j30 ] ) . for small values of the proper length of the compact dimension , the axial current is dominated by the part corresponding to the current density in the geometry without the cosmic string and magnetic flux along the @xmath1-axis . in this limit , the leding term in the asymptotic expansion is given by ( [ j3smalll ] ) and the string - induced corrections to this leading term are exponentially small .",
    "for large values of the ratio @xmath211 , the behavior of the axial current is described by ( [ j3largel ] ) . in this range the current density exhibits damping oscillations with power - law decaying amplitude as a function of the length of the compact dimension .",
    "this behavior is essentially different from the case of the string in minkowski bulk with the exponentially suppressed axial current for large values of @xmath8 .",
    "the results described above can be used , in particular , for the investigation of the effects induced by cosmic strings in the inflationary epoch .",
    "though the strings produced before or during early stages of inflation are diluted by the expansion , cosmic strings can be continuously formed during inflation by coupling the symmetry breaking and inflaton fields @xcite or by quantum - mechanical tunneling @xcite .",
