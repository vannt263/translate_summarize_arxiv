    "beyond the analytic and semi - analytic approaches giving the functional dependencies at the various limiting cases @xcite there is also a plenty of numeric methods .",
    "mobility is calculated adopting variational approaches @xcite , using frozen lattice approximation @xcite , through the einstein relation from the diffusion coefficient computed in the semiclassical phonon approximation @xcite , and using dinamical mean field theory @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested to obtain the mobility from the low frequency limit @xmath138 where the oc @xmath139 is calculated by quantum or semiclassical approach on a rather small finite systems @xcite . note that the finite size of the system , especially in the semiclassical limit @xcite , implies zero mobility unless _ arbitrary _ artificial level broadenings are added .",
    "note , each of the above approaches includes uncontrollable approximation .",
    "in contrast , all the approximations can be avoided if @xmath0 is obtained from the low frequency limit of the oc and @xmath140 is calculated exactly in the infinite lattice system .",
    "then , the exact oc @xmath139 can be obtained from the _ analytic continuation _",
    ", i.e. from the solution of the integral equation ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath141}{1-\\exp[-\\beta\\omega ] } \\ ;   \\sigma(\\omega ) \\equiv { \\cal f}[\\tau,\\sigma(\\omega ) ] \\ ;   \\label{s1}\\ ] ] ( @xmath142 ) if the current - current correlation function @xmath143 is exactly known at imaginary times @xmath144 .",
    "nowadays , unbiased @xmath145 can be obtained for infinite systems @xcite by several exact methods . in particular",
    ", we used the diagrammatic @xcite and world - line monte carlo @xcite methods checking that both approaches give the same results .",
    "so , the last obstacle to get the exact mobility is to solve the equation ( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , it belongs to the class of ill posed problems , i.e. , also due to the noise , even small , present in @xmath145 , there is not an unique function @xmath146 which exactly satisfies @xmath147 = 0 $ ] for all points @xmath148 , @xmath149 , where @xmath145 is known .",
    "so , a natural formulation of the strategy to solve the equation ( [ s1 ] ) is to find a set of solutions @xmath146 which minimize the objective function @xmath150 = \\frac{1}{m } \\sum_{i=1}^m   \\frac{\\left\\{\\pi(\\tau_i)-{\\cal f}[\\tau_i,\\widetilde{\\sigma}(\\omega ) \\right\\}^2}{s_i }   \\label{s2}\\ ] ] ( @xmath151 depend on the method ) , where @xmath146 is normalized as @xmath152 and @xmath153 is fixed by the average value of the kinetic energy @xmath154 @xmath155 any naive attempt to get @xmath156 by a mere minimization of @xmath157 leads to the saw tooth instability ( sti ) of the solution @xmath146 when the amplitude of fast oscillations is much larger than the actual answer . to deal with sti @xcite",
    "the vast majority of the methods introduces a regularization functional @xmath158 , i.e. @xmath159 : @xmath158 imposes constraints , ( smoothness , positiveness ) on the solution @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that such constraints can lead to significant bias of the result @xcite and , hence , it is very important to avoid any disguise of the objective function by a regularization functional . in this sense",
    ", one can single out sampling approaches @xcite where sti is suppressed by the self - averaging of the noise in a superposition of multiple solutions , each having its own large sti .",
    "although more computationally involved , these methods are not biased by the regularization term . in particular , we used the stochastic optimization method @xcite where @xmath160^{\\kappa}$ ] ( @xmath161 ) is a factor highlighting small values of @xmath162 when @xmath163 .",
    "description of the approach to determine on the errorbars of the mobility is given in the next section .",
    "there are several sources of error stemming from the estimate of the mobility through the low frequency limit of the oc : normalization , extrapolation and systematic errors .",
    "they are related to the properties of the kernel of the integral equation ( [ s1 ] ) , and to the stochastic optimization method ( som ) of the analytic continuation .",
    "in particular , the som strategy is based solely on the minimization of the objective function ( [ s2 ] ) , and does not use any regularization strategy to treat the saw - tooth noise instability by distorting the objective function . indeed , som averages over many solutions obtained through the minimization of the objective function starting from randomly chosen initial conditions . here",
    "the first source of uncertainty comes from the normalization of the oc : it introduces the _ normalization errorbar_. furthermore , the @xmath164 limit of the oc requires the extrapolation of the oc from low frequencies and sets the _ extrapolation errorbar_. finally , the _",
    "systematic errorbar _ is related to the failure to reproduce exactly the shape of the oc from an ideal noiseless current - current correlation function @xmath145 . as a typical example , fig .",

    ", width=264 ]    the maximal relative errorbar @xmath166 from the given source @xmath167 ( l is an index varying between 1 and 3 and corresponds to the three different sources of errorbars ) is obtained in the following way .",
    "we define @xmath168 as the true value of the mobility , which is either an average over the possible values of @xmath0 depending on some external parameter ( e.g. normalization of oc or range of @xmath1 values used for the extrapolation ) or it is just the exact @xmath169 value when ideal data are considered .",
    "the maximal ( minimal ) possible value of @xmath0 , allowed by uncertainty stemming from the given error source , is @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) then , the relative errorbar @xmath166 , for the assigned source @xmath167 , is defined as the maximum of two factors @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "we note that the goal of our procedure is to give the upper bound of the relative errorbar : it avoids the possibility of an its underestimate .    to get the joint influence of the errors from different and independent sources we convert the relative errorbars @xmath173 into the absolute ones @xmath174 .",

    "such large errorbars imply that the uncertainty of the mobility value is of the same order or even larger than the obtained value @xmath168 itself .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the mobility , in the range of the parameters investigated in the main text , involves ten orders of magnitude ( see fig .  3 of the main text ) and ,",
    "thus , even such an uncertainty does not make the analysis senseless .",
    "the _ normalization errorbar _",
    "@xmath186 comes from uncertainty related to the normalization @xmath153 .",
    "naively , it seems that the normalization @xmath187 of the oc can be fixed by the sum rule ( [ s3 ] ) relating @xmath187 to the kinetic energy .",
    "however , the sum rule ( [ s3 ] ) does not fix the problem since the shape of the oc is very sensitive to @xmath187 even in presence of very small errorbars , @xmath188 , which are set by the statistical fluctuations of the average kinetic energy calculated through monte carlo methods .",

    "[ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "then , one can try to find a proper @xmath153 by choosing the normalization that provides the minimum of the objective function .",

    "in particular , due to the normalization error , the analytic continuation at @xmath73 is one of the most difficult cases among the other ones encountered in the present study .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] . panel ( b ) shows the values of the objective function obtained by minimizing @xmath198 at different normalizations .",
    "the function @xmath145 for this analysis was calculated from the model curve for @xmath139 , called from now on as `` true spectrum '' , and the som was used to recover the oc from @xmath145 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the comparison of the true spectrum with the average of the ocs , obtained by varying the normalization coefficient below and above the value @xmath199 .",
    "we note that the overall shape of the oc is stable though the behavior of the low frequency part ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a ) is very sensitive to the normalization .",
    "this kind of instability comes from the structure of the kernel of the integral equation ( [ s1 ] ) : it is observed even in the case of noiseless ideal data .",

    "( [ s1 ] ) , one calculates @xmath204 , and tries to restore the value of mobility by solving again eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , this errobar is unique for every shape of the optical conductivity and temperature , is difficult to predict , and , thus , the procedure has to be repeated for all @xmath4 and @xmath2 values .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows several examples of comparison between true spectra and spectra obtained by som procedure .",
    "panel ( a ) shows spectrum which contains an high energy feature with large weight ( see inset in panel ( a ) ) and a low energy feature with tiny weight .",
    "one can see that the value of mobility is reproduced with rather small errobar . to the contrary , the curves with high energy large weight peaks and featureless low energy continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b - c ) ) point out the tendency to very large systematic errobars .",
    "indeed , the flaw of the way to analyze the systematic errorbar lies in the fact that one does not know the _",
    "real _ true spectrum and uses as true spectrum the oc _ obtained _ through the analytic continuation procedure .",
    "however , it is the best method that we are able to choose when the _ real _ spectrum is unknown .",
    "moreover , we found in numeric experiments that the relative systematic errorbar is reasonably stable if we change the height of the model function @xmath169 by a factor of two .",
    "its value mostly depends on the gross features of the spectrum , e.g. small structureless background at low frequencies and large peak at high frequencies , etc .",
    "the last fact insures us that the value of systematic error is reliable even in absence of exact informations on the _ real _ spectrum because it is known that the most of the procedures of analytic continuations reproduce the gross features of the spectrum correctly .",

    "<S> the regime of _ exponentially large mobility _ is well known from early analytic studies@xcite . at very low @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the thermal population of phonons is reduced as @xmath25 and @xmath26 is expected in the lowest temperature region , although our numerical studies could not reach such region . as it was revealed from our numeric results , there are two main crossovers separating distinct regions at higher temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> one is the temperature @xmath27 above which the drude peak in @xmath5 disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the temperature @xmath28 above which the mean free path ( mfp ) @xmath29 becomes shorter than the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> we found that @xmath27 coincides with the change in the temperature dependence of @xmath30 , while @xmath28 indicates the crossover from the _ band conduction _ to the _ incoherent metallic _ motion . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in spite of an always metallic @xmath2-dependence @xmath31 at @xmath32 , one can not always assume that the description in terms of a standard band motion with large mfp is valid . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the band motion takes place only in the left lower corner of @xmath3 diagram , whereas the incoherent metallic behavior with short mean free path is realized at @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> note the absolutely different nature of transport in these two regimes which both demonstrate power - law @xmath2-dependence @xmath34 with the index @xmath35 at weak- @xmath36 and @xmath37 at intermediate- and strong - couplings @xmath38 .    as raising @xmath39 the temperature dependence of mobility @xmath30 considerably changes . </S>",
    "<S> at high temperatures _ </S>",
    "<S> mobility saturation _ is observed : the steepness of the mobility temperature dependence , @xmath40 , becomes considerably smaller for weak epc @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at larger epc , @xmath42 , and lower temperatures ( but still at @xmath39 ) , a different transport regime , the well known _ activated hopping _ , sets in : @xmath43 becomes positive . </S>",
    "<S> it has been derived analytically @xcite and confirmed for specific parameters by our numeric results that in the last case @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) for adiabatic @xmath47 ( nonadiabatic @xmath48 ) case . here , the activation energy @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a polaron binding energy and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) in the adiabatic ( antiadiabatic ) case . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping transport begins above a temperature which has been derived to lie in the range between @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite . as we found in our studies , at high enough temperatures , the mobility @xmath30 tends to saturate also at strong epc . </S>",

    "<S> crossover from weak @xmath36 to strong @xmath58 regime is extremely smooth in one dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , we used diagrammatic monte carlo method @xcite to find the value of coupling @xmath18 constant dividing these regimes and calculated the effective mass renormalization @xmath59 , the binding energy @xmath51 , and the mean number of phonons @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) in the phonon cloud of a single polaron ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> actually , for larger couplings , @xmath38 , one can always fit @xmath30 by a power law ( [ metal ] ) below some @xmath4-dependent temperature @xmath91 : @xmath92 and @xmath93 . however , the index of the power law is different from @xmath82 found in the perturbative @xmath36 limit . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , the hopping transport is naturally distinguished from the resistivity saturation regime by the existence of temperature range with positive derivative @xmath101 above a characteristic temperature whose analytical estimate is in the range between @xmath54 and @xmath102 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we get a value consistent with @xmath103 ( filled circles and filled squares for mobilities at @xmath76 and @xmath77 in fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> so far , our analysis can distinguish a low-@xmath2 regime at @xmath32 , where power law decrease of mobility is observed , and , at @xmath39 , two different regimes depending on temperature and epc . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that low-@xmath2 regimes must be different at @xmath36 and @xmath58 because increase of @xmath4 must eventually encounter mott - ioffe - regel limit for mean free path ( mfp ) @xmath29 where band conduction with @xmath109 changes to an incoherent metallic transport with @xmath110 . to estimate the mean free path @xmath29 we write the optical absorption @xmath111 in terms of the memory function @xmath112 @xcite . at @xmath113 </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath114 is real and determines the reciprocal of the optical relaxation time @xmath115 , so that the mobility turns to be @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> this last relation allows to extract @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the free mean path is defined by @xmath118 , and a rough estimate of the average velocity @xmath119 can be obtained by @xmath120 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]b we plot the temperature dependence of @xmath121 at the different values of @xmath4 .    as shown above , analysis of our data distinguish four regimes . </S>",
    "<S> two low-@xmath2 regimes , band conduction and incoherent metallic transport , are characterized by the power law decrease of mobility when @xmath2 increases . </S>",
    "<S> these two regimes are distinguished by the mfp , which is much larger than the lattice constant in the first case and much smaller than @xmath11 in the second case . </S>",
    "<S> they are separated from the two high-@xmath2 regimes by @xmath4-dependent temperature @xmath27 , where metallic temperature dependence of mobility significantly changes . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes slower in high temperature saturation regime which sets up above @xmath27 at @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> to the contrary , @xmath30 starts to increase with temperature at large epc @xmath123 , although it also eventually saturates at large @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> careful analysis of the frequency dependent mobility @xmath5 shows that @xmath27 separates profoundly different physical regimes . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the drude peak is observed only below @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> low - energy drude peak is clearly seen at low @xmath2 , @xmath127 , it almost vanishes at @xmath128 , and it is absent for @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility in the band conduction regime quickly decreases with temperature at @xmath130 , which coincides with the temperature range of the drude peak existence . for higher temperatures , in agreement with assumptions made in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the resistivity saturation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we found that the drude peak at @xmath74 and @xmath130 gradually disappears without significant change of high energy - part , which is again in complete agreement with refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-dependence of the @xmath5 at strong epc , @xmath77 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) which is just the range where drude peak is seen ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](a ) ) . as previously discussed , this regime is not related to a band conduction transport , but it stems from a incoherent motion of the charge carriers with short mean free path . to the contrary , a drude - like peak is absent ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig4](b ) ) in the domain of the thermally activated transport , @xmath131 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite and confirmed in our study that the oc is characterized by a broad peak with the maximum around twice of the binding energy ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4]b ) . at @xmath132 </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath5 is @xmath2-independent at @xmath133 while the spectral weight at @xmath134 growth exponentially when @xmath2 increases ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the spectral weight starts to spread to larger frequencies when @xmath135 and , as a result , the static mobility @xmath30 starts to saturate .    in conclusion , we presented for the first time unbiased results for the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity @xmath20 ( or dynamic mobility @xmath5 ) and static mobility @xmath30 of the one - dimensional holstein polaron . the transport features display a strong @xmath4 and @xmath2 dependence . in particular we proved that a low-@xmath2 power - law behavior exists until the drude peak in the oc disappears at @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> however , while the standard band - like transport is recovered at weak couplings , an unconventional incoherent regime is observed at larger couplings . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at @xmath39 , the @xmath0-saturation ( activated hopping transport ) phenomenon occurs at weak ( strong ) couplings . finally our data imply that although mobilities and mean free paths at different values of @xmath4 differ by many orders of magnitude at small temperatures , their values at @xmath136 become very close to each other ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , regardless of the strength of the epc , the effective scattering of a polaron turns to be very strong when the temperature exceeds the bare bandwidth @xmath137 .    </S>",
