    "in contrast , studies of another process of the basic and applied significance - electron scattering off the mn atom - are too scarce .",
    "the mn atom presents a special interest for studying electron scattering processes .",
    "this is because it belongs to a class of atoms with the highest spin multiplicity .",
    "the latter is owing to co - directed spins of all five electrons in the mn @xmath0 subshell , due to hund s rule . as of today , understanding of electron scattering off mn is rudimentary .",

    "@xcite did it in a r - matrix framework , and recently remeta and kelemen @xcite performed their calculations of said dcs in the framework of a local spin density approximation , but , again , only at discrete values of the electron energies of @xmath16 and @xmath15 ev .",
    "whatever interesting effects were found in the above cited works they provide only a limited insight into a problem , since things might work quite differently at other , especially lower electron energies but just @xmath16 and @xmath15 ev energies .",
    "clearly , studying the scattering process through a continuum spectrum of electron energies is a way toward a deeper understanding of , as well as discovering new trends in , e@xmath8mn elastic scattering , in particular , and e@xmath8@xmath17 , in general .",

    "first , this is a one - electron `` spin - polarized '' hartree - fock ( sphf ) approximation @xcite which is the zero - order approximation in perturbation theory in the coulomb interelectron interaction @xmath21 for the green function . in refs .",
    "@xcite , sphf was adapted , as well as proven to be applicable , to the description of elastic electron scattering off semifilled shell atoms .",
    "second , @xmath19 is calculated in the second - order approximation in perturbation theory in @xmath21 , to account for electron correlation in the system .",
    "this approximation is known as a simplified random phase approximation with exchange @xcite and , with sphf being chosen as the zero - order approximation with respect to electron correlation interactions , is referred to as sprpae@xmath22 , in the present paper .",
    "third , for a fuller account of electron correlation in electron scattering , @xmath19 is determined beyond sprpae@xmath22 approximation by solving the dyson equation for @xmath19 of a scattered electron , as in ref .",
    "such approximation is referred to as sprpae@xmath23 in the paper . by comparing results obtained in the framework of each of the sphf , sprpae@xmath22 , and sprpae@xmath23 approximations",
    "we unravel several important trends in e@xmath8mn scattering ; these have already been noted in abstract and are subject to a detailed discussion in text .",
    "atomic units ( a.u . ) are used throughout the paper unless specified otherwise .",
    "a convenient starting approximation to study the structure and spectra of semifilled shell atoms is a `` spin - polarized '' hartree - fock ( sphf ) approximation @xcite . over the years",
    ", sphf has been extensively and successfully exploited by the authors of this paper and their colleagues ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) by using it directly , or utilizing it as the zero - order approximation for a multielectron random phase approximation with exchange ( rpae ) @xcite , to study photoionization of said atoms and their ions . as noted earlier , sphf",
    "was also used successfully by amusia and dolmatov @xcite to provide the initial understanding and interpretation of experimental data of williams et.al .",
    "@xcite on the @xmath15 ev e@xmath8mn elastic dcs .",
    "recently , sphf has been employed by remeta and kelemen @xcite to adapt a local density approximation to electron scattering off semifilled shell atoms , including mn , to provide a further understanding of results of experiments @xcite .",
    "applicability of sphf , as well as the generalized on its basis other methods @xcite , for calculations and understanding of said phenomena with semifilled shell atoms - participants is out of doubt .",
    "the quintessence of sphf is as follows .",
    "it accounts for the fact that spins of all electrons in a semifilled subshell of the atom ( e.g. , in the @xmath0 subshell of mn ) are co - directed , in accordance with hund s rule .",
    "it will be assumed in the present paper that spins of said electrons point upward ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this results in splitting of each of other closed @xmath24 subshells in the atom into two semifilled subshells of opposite spin orientations , @xmath25@xmath9 and @xmath25@xmath10 .",
    "this is in view of the presence of exchange interaction between @xmath26@xmath9 electrons with spin - up electrons in the original semifilled subshell of the atom but absence of such for @xmath26@xmath10 electrons .",
    "thus , the atom of concern of this paper - the mn atom - has the following sphf configuration : mn( ... @xmath27@xmath9@xmath27@xmath10@xmath28@xmath9@xmath29@xmath9@xmath30@xmath10 , @xmath31s ) .",
    "sphf equations for the ground or excited states of a semifilled shell atom differ from ordinary hf equations for closed shell atoms ( see , e.g. @xcite ) by accounting for exchange interaction only between electrons with the same spin orientation ( @xmath9 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , @xmath10 ) .    by solving sphf equations , one determines radial parts @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the wavefunctions of spin - up and spin - down electrons in the ground , excited , or scattering state of the atom . for the continuum energy spectrum of scattered electrons ,",

    "[ fig2]-[fig5 ] that both sprpae@xmath22 and sprpae@xmath23 correlation affects strongly all phase shifts quantitatively and in a number of cases - for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 partial waves - even qualitatively , compared to sphf calculated data .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) drops abruptly , with decreasing electron energy , from @xmath98 to @xmath99 rad between @xmath100 to @xmath101 ev , then develops a maximum at yet lower energies , after which it approaches its final value of @xmath102 at @xmath103 . clearly , the described behavior of sprpae@xmath23 calculated @xmath97 has little in common with that obtained in the framework of sprpae@xmath22 .",
    "strong quantitative differences take place between sprpae@xmath22 and srpar@xmath23 calculated data for @xmath104 as well , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . also , notice abrupt changes in sprpae@xmath23 calculated phase shifts @xmath105 between approximately @xmath82 and @xmath23 ev , in opposition to those calculated in sprpae@xmath22 .",
    "the unraveled drastic differences between sprpae@xmath23 and sprpae@xmath22 calculated phase shifts is a novel result ; it was not observed in previous similar calculations performed for other atoms .",
    "thus , the present work reveals , and generally proves , the necessity for a fuller account ( as in sprpae@xmath23 ) of correlation beyond the second - order approximation ( sprpae@xmath22 ) for an adequate understanding of e@xmath8mn scattering .",
    "third , which is of significant importance , notice differences between phases of scattered electronic waves with the same @xmath38s but opposite spin orientations , @xmath106 versus @xmath93 .",
    "said differences are drastic for @xmath107 as well as @xmath108 spin - up and spin - down waves in all three sphf , sprpae@xmath22 , and sprpae@xmath23 approximations ( cp .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "for other spin - up and spin - down waves the differences in question are less spectacular , but , nevertheless , exist as well .",
    "thus , it is revealed in the present study that , generally , scattering of oppositely spin - polarized electrons off the mn atom take different routes .",
    "below , we provide reasons for the unraveled trends in the e@xmath8mn electron scattering phase shifts .      in sphf ,",
    "the dependence of e@xmath8mn scattering phase shifts on a spin - orientation of a scattered electron is a straightforward effect .",
    "it is due to the presence / absence of exchange interaction between , respectively , @xmath109@xmath9/@xmath109@xmath10 incoming electrons and primarily five @xmath110@xmath9 electrons in the semifilled @xmath0@xmath9 subshell in the atom .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of elastic electron scattering off any semifilled shell atom , for an obvious reason .",
    "next , since no stable negative mn ion exists with the ground - state atomic core configuration @xcite , the number @xmath111 of bound @xmath86@xmath9 states in the atom is @xmath112 ( due to the presence of @xmath0@xmath113 subshell in the atom ) , whereas corresponding @xmath114 .",

    "this translates into the initial drastic quantitative and qualitative differences between sphf calculated phase shifts @xmath122 ( fig .  [ fig3 ] , dashed line ) and @xmath123 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , dashed line ) .      in sprae@xmath22 , compared to sphf , differences between @xmath124 and @xmath125 scattering phases become even more spectacular .",
    "indeed , one can see ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , dotted line ) that the sprpae@xmath22 calculated real part @xmath126 of @xmath124 is a monotonic function of @xmath39 in the interval of @xmath100 to @xmath82 ev , but the real part @xmath127 of @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , dotted line ) is not .",
    "the latter now has a well developed minimum followed by an appreciable maximum with decreasing energy @xmath128 ev .",
    "this results , partly , in an additional , compared to sphf , quantitative as well as qualitative difference between @xmath124 and @xmath125 , due to the effects of electron correlation .",
    "next , when sprpae@xmath22 correlation is accounted for , no lesser spectacular differences also emerge between the calculated @xmath129 and @xmath130 scattering phases .",
    "indeed , sprpae@xmath22 correlation is seen to induce strong differences between the real parts @xmath131 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , dotted line ) and @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , dotted line ) of phase shifts @xmath129 and @xmath130 : @xmath133 turns into an oscillating function of @xmath39 whereas @xmath134 does not .",
    "a trial calculation showed that the sprpae@xmath22 correlation induced differences between @xmath135 and @xmath136 are due primarily to polarization of the @xmath0@xmath9 subshell by an incoming @xmath109 electron .",
    "thus , when the incoming electron is a spin - up electron , exchange diagrams ( b ) and ( d ) with @xmath137@xmath9@xmath138 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] contribute to phase shifts , whereas their contributions vanish for a spin - down incoming electron , as was explained earlier in text .",
    "higher order sprpae@xmath23 correlation corrections , compared to sprpae@xmath22 , induce additional significant changes , primarily in @xmath139@xmath140 and @xmath139@xmath141 scattering phases . while the impact of said corrections on a real part @xmath142@xmath143 of @xmath139@xmath141 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , solid line ) results mostly in its quantitative change compared to corresponding sprpae@xmath22 data , it ( the impact ) makes a real part @xmath142@xmath144 of @xmath139@xmath140 to become both quantitatively and qualitatively different than @xmath142@xmath145 , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , solid line .",
    "the unraveled different impact of sprpae@xmath23 correlation on @xmath139@xmath140 compared to @xmath139@xmath141 is because the sprpae@xmath23 equation for the reducible self - energy part of the green - function , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , contains many cross - product terms between terms associated with each of the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "note , there are no cross - products terms in the framework of sprpae@xmath22 at all . since the number of @xmath110 electrons in the mn atom is a @xmath146 unbalanced in favor of @xmath110@xmath9 electrons , many sprpae@xmath23 cross - product terms , involving various excitations of @xmath110@xmath9 electrons , vanish for an incoming spin - down electron but remain for a spin - up scattered electron .",
    "this aggravates the difference between the sprpae@xmath23 correlation impact on scattering of spin - up compared to spin - down electrons off the atom compared to the difference emerging in sprpae@xmath22 calculations . for @xmath107 incoming electrons ,",
    "this difference is huge , as was illustrated above .",
    "thus , the carried out study reveals that the lower - order sprpae@xmath22 approximation is clearly insufficient for a proper understanding of electron scattering off a semifilled shell atom .",
    "this is an important finding .",
    "note , the demonstrated fast variation of the sprpae@xmath23 @xmath124 phase with energy in a quite narrow energy region near @xmath100 ev can be interpreted as a prominent time - delay of the partial @xmath107@xmath10 wave while crossing the atomic region .",

    "@xmath124 as well as @xmath126 pass through the value of @xmath159 , at certain values of the electron energy .",

    "in summary , it is unraveled in the present paper that ( a ) sprpae@xmath22 and sprpae@xmath23 electron correlation affects significantly e@xmath8mn electron elastic scattering phase shifts and cross sections , ( b ) correlation may affect , and in the case of the mn atom does affect , drastically differently scattering phase shifts of electrons with opposite spin - orientations , ( c ) a fuller account of correlation ( as in sprpae@xmath23 ) beyond the second - order approximation of perturbation theory in the coulomb interelectron interaction ( sprpae@xmath22 ) may be , and in the case of e@xmath8mn scattering is , crucial for an adequate understanding of the spectrum of corresponding phase shifts and cross sections versus the electron energy , and ( d ) a combined impact of the semifilled shell nature of the mn atom and electron correlation results in the emergence of a novel type of the resonance - the semifilled - shell - correlation resonance - in the e@xmath8mn total elastic scattering cross section .",
    "we urge experimentalists and other theorists to verify the made predictions .",
    "furthermore , the unraveled physics behind the discovered effects in e@xmath8mn scattering is so clear that the present authors have little doubts that most of the effects are inherent features of electron elastic scattering off any multilectron semifilled shell atom in general , not just off the mn atom .",
    "the predicted effects should even be stronger for atoms - scatterers with a higher spin multiplicity ( than that of mn ) , such as the cr( ... @xmath173@xmath9@xmath174@xmath9 , @xmath175s ) or eu( ... @xmath176@xmath9@xmath177@xmath9@xmath178@xmath10 , @xmath179s ) atoms , or similar .",
