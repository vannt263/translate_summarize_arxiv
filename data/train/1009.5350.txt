    "the theory of radiation driven winds ( cak , ( * ? ? ? * castor et al . 1975 ) ) and later m - cak ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pauldrach et al . 1986 ) ) succeeded in describing terminal velocities ( v@xmath1 ) and mass losses ( @xmath2 ) of hot stars apart from predicting the wind momentum luminosity ( wml ) relationship .",
    "this relationship was empirically found for the most of luminous o - type stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* puls et al . 1996 ) ) and extended to lower luminosity objects by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kudritzki et al . ( 1999 ) ) , who found that it depends on the spectral type .",
    "particularly , asg show v@xmath3 values a factor 3 lower than theoretical ones ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* achmad et al . 1997 ) ) and v@xmath1 decreases when increasing the escape velocity ( v@xmath4 ) ( ( * ? ? ? * verdugo et al . 1999 ) ) , in clear contradiction with the cak theory ( fast solution ) .",
    "moreover , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kudritzki et al . ( 1999 ) ) found that h@xmath5 profile of these stars can be modeled with @xmath6 velocity laws , for @xmath71 .",
    "these observational discrepancies with cak and m - cak theories could be related to a change in the parameter @xmath5 along the wind due either to a change in the ionization of the wind or to a decoupling of the line - driven ions in the wind from the ambient gas ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* achmad et al . 1997 ) ) . in 2004 ,",
    "* cur ( 2004 ) ) revisited the theory of steady fast - rotating line - driven winds and found that for @xmath8=v / v@xmath9@xmath10% there exists another hydrodynamical or _",
    "solution , which is denser and slower than the standard m - cak solution . for b - type stars he obtained velocity distributions , as well as the critical point and @xmath2 , that can be matched by a velocity law with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , we propose here that the winds of asg could be related to the _ slow hydrodynamical solutions _ described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cur ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that for asg , given a particular set of wind parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath5 and @xmath0 , there exists a _",
    "slow solution _ at all latitudes for low rotational velocities ( @xmath8@xmath120.4 ) , and even for the non - rotating case .",
    "we calculated numerically wind solutions for different rotational velocities and different stellar and wind parameters .",
    "table [ tab1 ] lists some of the models we computed for low values of @xmath8 : those marked with an `` s '' in the first column present a slow solution at all latitudes , while the remaining corresponds to the fast solution at all latitudes ( `` f '' ) .",
    "figure[fig1 ] displays the behaviour of the fast and slow solutions as a function of latitude for models with the same stellar and wind parameters , except @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath2 and v@xmath1 obtained with models 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 are in good agreement with those observed in asg ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* verdugo et al . 1999 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kudritzki et al . 1999 ) ) .",
    "instead , the fast solution leads to higher @xmath2 and v@xmath1 .",
    "we find that the solutions for slow winds ( see figure[fig2 ] , in white / grey romboids ) match observational data of some asg stars ( black symbols , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* verdugo et al . 1998 ) ) .    by solving the 1-d hydrodynamic equation of rotating line - driven winds of asg for different sets of line force parameters",
    ", we found a slow wind regime over all latitudes when increasing the parameter @xmath0 , which describes changes in the ionization stage of the wind .",
    "these slow solutions trace the observational trends found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* verdugo et al . ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "our result supports these authors hypothesis , stating that the negative slope of v@xmath1/v@xmath4vs.v@xmath4 could be related to the degree of ionization and wind density ."
