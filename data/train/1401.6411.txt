    "+ it is well known that the interaction between quarks and gluons becomes stronger in low - energy processes @xcite . due to this non - perturbative characteristic of qcd",

    "the relevant form factors have been studied before with chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt ) @xcite in the @xmath6 decays@xcite , where the photon is almost on - shell .",
    "the knowledge of this interaction can be used to compute radiative corrections and the couplings needed to calculate the lightest pseudoscalar contributions to the hadronic light - by - light piece of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon@xcite . + the difference between the @xmath7 process and the pion decay is that the process we study may have an energy above the chiral symmetry breaking scale , where the @xmath5pt is no longer valid ; this is why we employ resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath5t)@xcite .",
    "r@xmath5 t introduces meson resonances as dynamical fields preserving the chiral symmetry properties and carrying out the required calculation by means of an expansion in powers of the inverse of the number of colours , @xmath8@xcite .",
    "+ the @xmath7 @xcite decays have not been measured yet , and in order to compute the branching ratios and invariant mass spectra we follow the work done in @xcite , where the process with a real photon is analyzed and the participating vector and axial - vector form factors are obtained . as a consequence of the virtuality of the photon , a diagram that vanished in @xcite now contributes to the amplitude , giving rise to a third contributing form factor , @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ ma ] ) , proportional to the vector two - pion form factor , which was implemented following  @xcite .",
    "the contributions to the process decay amplitude are the bremsstrahlung off the @xmath9 , off the @xmath10 and the vector and axial - vector contributions ; respectively@xcite    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14+\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.b(k^2 ) k^2\\left[\\mathit{g}_{\\mu \\nu } -\\frac{(p+k)_\\mu p_\\nu}{k^2 + 2p\\cdot k}\\right]\\right\\}l^{\\mu } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined    @xmath15",
    "+ since the mass of the @xmath9 lepton is larger than the @xmath5pt expansion parameter , the perturbative approach does no longer converge for this process . at this energy scale",
    "the lightest resonances are used as dynamical fields , because the masses of these resonances are smaller or of the order of the @xmath9 lepton mass .",
    "this is done with r@xmath5 t , using as expansion parameter @xmath8 to compute the form factors .",

    "the error bands due to variations of the couplings are displayed in the right hand side of the table .",

    "after numerical integration , we obtained the contributions to the total branching ratio of the different parts .",
    "these different contributions come from the squared moduli of the three amplitudes described in the previous section and their interferences .",
    "however , in our approach there is an uncertainty in this short distance constraints which is @xmath28 20% . taking this into account ,",

    "the normalized invariant - mass distribution of the lepton pair , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the inverse of the @xmath9 lifetime and @xmath31 the invariant mass of the @xmath27 pair , is shown in figure [ e ] for @xmath32 , and in figure [ mu ] for @xmath33 .",
    "it can be observed in figure [ e ] that the structure independent contribution dominates the spectrum for values of @xmath34 gev@xmath35 , but for larger values , the axial - vector contribution dominates the rest of the spectrum apart from the @xmath36 peak .",
    "the interference terms are negative for most of the spectrum and do not appear in the figure because of their smallness . in figure [ mu ] , at low invariant mass",
    "the a contribution is comparable to the ib contribution , but for relatively low values and in the higher energy region the a contribution dominates the spectrum , except around the @xmath36 mass .",
    "the branching fractions shown in table [ t1 ] were obtained by integrating numerically these invariant - mass distributions and checked from a direct integration over the five independent kinematic variables . + the fact that in both cases the structure dependent contribution dominates at @xmath37 gev@xmath35 justifies our assumption of including only one multiplet of vector and axial - vector resonances . it can be seen in both figures that the a - a contribution is peaked in the @xmath36 mass region , this is due to the inclusion of the @xmath4 form factor , because it is proportional to the i = 1 component of the electromagnetic di - pion form factor , showing how essential this contribution is .",
