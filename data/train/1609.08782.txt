    "long - range - interacting systems abound in nature @xcite .",
    "interactions are called long - range when the pair potential energy decays asymptotically with the interparticle distance @xmath3 as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 in @xmath6 spatial dimensions , as it happens for instance in coulomb and gravitational interactions .",
    "one striking feature of many - particle long - range interacting systems is that they are typically found in states that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this is at variance with systems with short - range interactions : while nonequilibrium states in short - range systems require an enduring external forcing to counteract the tendency of the system to reach due to `` collisional '' effects a thermal equilibrium state , an isolated long - range interacting system evolving while starting far from equilibrium will remain stuck in an out - of - equilibrium state for very long times .",
    "such times grow with the number @xmath7 of degrees of freedom , so that they may become larger than any experimentally accessible timescale .",
    "for instance , the time needed for a galaxy to reach an `` equilibrium '' state is estimated to be several orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "this property is universal , in the sense that it is shared by all systems with long - range interactions , regardless of the details of the interaction potential .",
    "it is understood as a consequence of the fact that the kinetic equation governing the evolution of the single - particle distribution function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the canonically conjugated positions and momenta , respectively , is the vlasov equation ( often referred to as the collisionless boltzmann equation , mainly in the astrophysical literature ) , up to a timescale @xmath11 when collisional effects can no longer be neglected , with @xmath11 diverging with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "such an equation has infinitely many stationary solutions : among these , the stable ones are identified with the observed non - equilibrium states , often referred to as _ quasi - stationary states _",
    "( qsss ) , and the thermal equilibrium state is just one out of infinitely many .",
    "the overall qualitative picture of the dynamical evolution of an isolated long - range system starting far from thermal equilibrium is the following : after a transient ( referred to as _ violent relaxation _ after lynden - bell @xcite ) whose lifetime does not depend on @xmath7 , the system sets into a qss and stays there for a time of the order of @xmath11 . for times",
    "@xmath12 , when the vlasov description no longer applies , the qss is no longer stationary , and the system eventually evolves to a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the qss the system relaxes to after the violent relaxation depends on the initial conditions , and no general theory is available yet to predict it .",
    "a completely general statistical approach was proposed by lynden - bell @xcite , but it rests on the hypothesis of complete mixing of the vlasov dynamics that only rarely holds , hence , gives reasonably accurate predictions only in very particular cases @xcite .",
    "other methods have been proposed since then , which give good predictions for simple models only for special classes of initial conditions , namely , for single - level initial distributions ( the so - called `` water - bag '' distributions ) @xcite or when the relaxation towards the qss is nearly adiabatic @xcite .",
    "although predicting the full distribution function in a qss resulting from a generic initial condition is a formidable task , especially for spatially inhomogeneous qsss whose stability properties are particularly difficult to analyze , one may ask whether the qsss that are reached in certain situations do share some common features .",
    "one of the hallmarks of thermal equilibrium is a uniform temperature throughout the system , hence , also in inhomogeneous equilibrium states , the temperature will be constant .",
    "conversely , in a nonequilibrium state , the temperature may well be nonuniform .",
    "hence , one may ask whether some properties of the temperature profile in a qss share a certain degree of universality .",
    "a physically relevant case is that of a system prepared in a ( spatially inhomogeneous ) thermal equilibrium state and then brought out of equilibrium by means of a ( non - small ) sudden perturbation , acting for a very short time . as shown in recent papers @xcite , in this case , the typical outcome is somewhat surprising and counterintuitive , and is referred to as _ temperature inversion_. the latter effect implies that the density and temperature profiles are anticorrelated : sparser regions of the system are hotter than denser ones .",
    "temperature inversions are observed in nature in astrophysical settings , the most famous example being the solar corona , where the temperature grows from thousands to millions of kelvin while going from the photosphere to the sparser external regions of the corona @xcite .",
    "other examples of temperature inversions have been observed , for instance , in molecular clouds @xcite . as argued in @xcite",
    ", temperature inversion should not be a peculiarity of systems in extreme conditions , as astrophysical systems typically are , but should rather be a generic property of long - range interacting systems relaxing to a qss after having been brought out of ( spatially inhomogeneous ) thermal equilibrium by a perturbation . in @xcite ,",
    "temperature inversion was observed as a result of perturbations of a thermal state of a prototypical model with long - range interactions , the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model @xcite , and of a two - dimensional self - gravitating system .",
    "temperature inversion in the latter system is thoroughly investigated in @xcite in connection with filamentary structures in galactic molecular clouds .",
    "partial temperature inversions were also observed in qsss of two - dimensional self - gravitating systems whose initial conditions were of the water - bag type @xcite . in one - dimensional self - gravitating systems , temperature inversions in qsss",
    "were observed , which gradually disappear during the slow relaxation of the system from the qss to thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "temperature inversion was recently demonstrated to occur in the nonequilibrium stationary state of a class of mean - field systems involving rotators subject to quenched disordered external drive and dissipation @xcite .",
    "a physical picture of the origin of temperature inversion in a generic long - range interacting system , based on the interplay between a mechanism originally proposed to explain the temperature profile in the solar corona ( referred to as _ velocity filtration _",
    "@xcite ) and the interaction of the system particles with the time - dependent mean field , was also suggested @xcite .",
    "if the phenomenon of temperature inversion is somewhat universal in long - range interacting systems abruptly brought out of thermal equilibrium , one may wonder whether it could be observed also in a controlled laboratory experiment . in the present paper ,",
    "we aim at taking a step forward towards a positive answer to this question .",
    "first of all , using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , we demonstrate that in the hmf model , with both attractive and repulsive interactions , temperature inversion is typically observed when the system is brought out of thermal equilibrium by means of an abrupt change ( from now on referred to as a _ quench _ ) of a parameter controlling the dynamics of the system , like a coupling constant or an external field . to this end",
    ", we employ a variety of different quench protocols .",
    "our studies are relevant to experiments because quench protocols can be performed with experimental setups , especially in systems of ( cold ) atoms ; moreover , an hmf model with repulsive interactions and an external confining field can be seen as a toy model of trapped ions , while an hmf model with attractive interactions does share many features with atoms interacting with light in a cavity .",
    "we then elaborate on this point by demonstrating that at least one of the considered quench protocols can be applied to another model , which mimics more closely an experimental setup of atoms interacting with a standing electromagnetic wave in an optical cavity @xcite , again yielding temperature inversion .",
    "it is worth noting that the quenching protocol applicable to the latter model does correspond to changing a parameter that can be actually tuned in an experiment , that is , the intensity of an external laser pump .",
    "we also give evidence that the physical picture proposed in @xcite does apply to temperature inversions produced by quenches .",
    "finally , we show that an iterative quenching protocol , combined with filtering out the high - energy particles localized in the sparser external regions , can be used to cool the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hmf ] , we introduce the hmf model , and study the temperature inversion produced by quenching the external field in the case of repulsive interactions (  [ sec : af - qh ] ) as well as that produced in the case with attractive interactions by quenching the external field (  [ sec : f - qh ] ) and the coupling constant (  [ sec : f - qj ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : morigi ] , we discuss a model of atoms interacting with light in an optical cavity , with emphasis on the dissipationless limit (  [ sec : dissipless ] ) .",
    "we then report on temperature inversion as observed in the latter system after quenching the coupling constant (  [ sec : morigi - qj ] ) , and discuss its possible observation in a laboratory experiment (  [ sec : morigi - exp ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : cooling ] is devoted to demonstrating that an iterative application of the previously considered quenching protocols can cool the systems .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn and open issues are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the prototypical model of long - range interacting systems that we shall consider in this paper is the so - called hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite .",
    "the model comprises a system of @xmath7 globally - coupled point particles of unit mass moving on a circle .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , in presence of an external field of strength @xmath13 , is given by h=_i=1^n+_i , j=1^n [ 1-(_i-_j)]-h_i=1^n_i .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath18 can be either positive or negative , defining respectively the ferromagnetic ( f ) and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) version of the model .",
    "the reason for the use of terms borrowed from the physics of magnetic systems is that the hmf model can also be seen as a system of planar ( @xmath19 ) spins with mean - field couplings ( that is , defined on a complete graph with links of the same strength ) . for @xmath20 ,",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hmf - h ] ) is @xmath21-invariant .",
    "ferromagnetic ( respectively , antiferromagnetic ) interactions in the magnetic picture correspond to attractive ( respectively , repulsive ) interactions in the particle interpretation .",
    "the time evolution of the system is governed by the hamilton equations derived from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hmf - h ] ) : \\ {    ccl & = & p_i , + & & + & = & j(m_y _ i - m_x _ i)-h_i ,    .",

    "for @xmath43 , the system in thermal equilibrium is characterized by an inhomogeneous distribution of particles on the circle , with clustering around @xmath44 . in the af case ,",
    "a nonzero external field is necessary to have an inhomogeneous thermal state , while in the f case , a clustered equilibrium state is attained even with @xmath45 , via a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath21 symmetry by the attractive interaction between the particles , provided the total energy density is smaller than a critical value @xmath46 , see fig .",

    "we consider @xmath52 particles and prepare the system in an inhomogeneous equilibrium state ( @xmath53 ) at an initial value of the field @xmath54 and temperature @xmath55 , by sampling independently for every particle the coordinate @xmath33 and the momentum @xmath34 from the distribution ( [ eq : hmf - gaussian - solution ] ) .",

    "a physical picture was put forward to explain the emergence of temperature inversion , and we argue that it applies also in the present case ( and , as we shall discuss below , to all the cases discussed in the present paper ) . without entering into details ,",
    "let us recall the main points of this explanation .",
    "after the quench ( or the perturbation ) , a collective oscillation ( i.e. , a wave ) sets in , as witnessed by the time evolution of the magnetization ( fig.[fig : ahmf - quench - h - mag ] ) .",
    "the oscillation damps out in time , but the system is conservative with no dissipative mechanism being present .",
    "hence , the energy lost by the wave must be acquired by some of the particles .",
    "this may happen via landau damping , an ubiquitous phenomenon in systems with long - range interactions : particles whose velocity is not too far from the phase velocity @xmath69 of the wave interact strongly with the wave itself .",
    "the net result is that the nearly resonant particles gain kinetic energy from the wave , so that the momentum distribution @xmath70 develops small peaks or shoulders and becomes different from a thermal distribution . in particular , close to the resonances , there will be suprathermal regions , i.e. , regions where @xmath71 is larger than the initial thermal distribution .",
    "now , the mechanism of velocity filtration comes into play as follows .",
    "the density @xmath57 is maximum at @xmath39 and decreases for larger and smaller @xmath33 s , reaching its minimum around @xmath72 .",
    "the net effect of the interaction between the particles and the external field is to create an effective force field pushing the particles towards @xmath39 , so that the particles have to climb the potential energy well to reach the sparser regions of the system ; particles with larger kinetic energies will do that more easily than `` colder '' particles , and any suprathermal region present in the velocity distribution will be magnified in regions where the particle density is lower .",
    "this is precisely what happens in our case , as shown in fig.[fig : ahmf - quench - h - f(p ) ] , where the velocity distribution function measured at a position where the particle density @xmath42 is smaller , @xmath73 , see panel ( a ) , is plotted together with the same function measured at the position of maximum density , @xmath74 , see panel ( b ) .",
    "magnified suprathermal regions in @xmath73 are apparent , and are responsible for the fact that the variance of the velocity distribution is here larger than in the denser regions of the system .     in the qss obtained under the same conditions as for fig.[fig",

    "we repeated some of the numerical experiments with @xmath76 particles , observing no differences with respect to the @xmath52 case .    in principle",
    ", one can quench also the coupling constant @xmath18 , while keeping the field @xmath13 fixed .",

    ", quenching @xmath13 corresponds to quenching the strength of the confining trap , which in principle is an experimentally feasible protocol .",
    "conversely , quenching @xmath18 is equivalent to quenching the charge of the ions , which does not seem very physical , so that we do not study this kind of quench protocol for the af case .",

    "moreover , it opens up the possibility of a different way of cooling a system with respect to the nowadays commonly used ones .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that quasi - stationary states that an isolated long - range interacting system relaxes to when starting from a spatially inhomogeneous thermal equilibrium and subsequently subject to a quench of one of the parameters of the hamiltonian generically exhibit the phenomenon of temperature inversion . using molecular dynamics simulations of a prototypical model , the hmf model , we have shown that different quench protocols lead to temperature inversion , in presence and in absence of an external field , and with both attractive and repulsive interactions : no fine - tuning is necessary in any of the cases .",
    "this lends further support to the claim made in @xcite that , rather than a peculiarity of some astrophysical systems , temperature inversion should be a `` universal '' feature of nonequilibrium quasi - stationary states resulting from perturbations of spatially inhomogeneous thermal equilibrium .",
    "moreover , our analysis of the momentum distribution functions supports the interpretation put forward in @xcite that temperature inversion arises due to an interplay between wave - particle interaction ( the role of the wave being played by the oscillation of the mean field induced by the perturbation or the quench ) and velocity filtration .",
    "the latter is a mechanism proposed by scudder @xcite to explain the temperature profile of the solar corona , and basically amounts to the statement that a suprathermal velocity distribution becomes broader when climbing a potential well .",

    "@xcite , we have argued that a quench of the external laser pump should be able to produce a quasi - stationary state with temperature inversion in a system of , say , rubidium atoms in a cavity that is initially in thermal equilibrium at temperatures reachable by laser cooling .",
    "such a quasi - stationary state should survive for quite a long time before being destroyed by dissipative effects .",
    "the latter claim is made on the assumption that the timescales of dissipation are the same as those observed in @xcite .",
    "similar to our study , these works also considered a quench of the coupling constant , but from different initial states and to different final states , and this may affect the dissipation timescales .",
    "however , results in @xcite seem to indicate that dissipation is inhibited in spatially inhomogeneous states , and this would be an advantage for a quench experiment like those suggested here .",
    "an interesting follow - up of the present work , in view of a detailed study of the feasibility of an experiment , would surely be to use the techniques of @xcite to study the evolution after quenches like the ones described here under a dynamics that fully takes into account the dissipative effects . another interesting system to study in view of a possible experiment to detect temperature inversion",
    "would be a system of trapped ions , which may be related to the antiferromagnetic hmf model .",
    "work is in progress along this direction @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that temperature inversion may be exploited to cool the system .",
    "the cooling protocol is of iterative type , and takes advantage of the fact that in states with temperature inversion hotter particles are spatially separated from colder ones , so that they can be filtered out .",
    "let us sign off by saying that temperature inversion is one of many fascinating features of the nonequilibrium states of long - range interacting systems that are yet to be unveiled .",
