    "<S> [ thm : main ] for any @xmath1mutation sequence on the dp3 quiver we can associate a subgraph @xmath60 of the brane tiling to each cluster variable @xmath46 ( respectively @xmath47 ) produced such that @xmath72 and respectively , @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in section [ sec : factor ] , we obtain :    * a factorization formula for cluster variables produced in @xmath3-mutation sequences on the dp3 quiver . </S>",
    "<S> this combined with the main result implies that all aztec castles have @xmath74 perfect matchings . </S>",
    "<S> * a recursion which enables efficient calculation of cluster - variables arising in any @xmath3-mutation sequence . </S>",
    "<S> * explicit formulae for the cluster variables produced by any @xmath3-mutation sequence .    in the remainder of the introduction </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a construction for visualizing @xmath3-mutation sequences ( section [ subsec : cox ] ) , and break the set of them into twelve types , up to symmetries ( section [ sec : coxsym ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> sections [ sec : integercone ] and [ sec : new - half - int ] then describe the aztec castles appearing from two of these types @xmath3-mutation sequences , corresponding to alcoves in the northeast cone and southwest cone , respectively , as defined below . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of our main theorem follows from the results in these sections ( theorems [ thm : intcone ] and [ thm : halfintcone ] ) and a brief symmetry argument presented in section [ sec : coxsym ] . finally , in section [ sec : </S>",
    "<S> conclusion ] , we end with some open problems and directions for future research .    </S>",
    "<S> coxeter lattice and relations [ subsec : cox ]    we will now describe how we use the triangular lattice associated to the coxeter group @xmath2 , the * coxeter lattice * @xcite , to allow for a clear visualization of @xmath3-mutation sequences . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible because the relations observed amongst the variant @xmath75 s ( see definition [ def : tau ] and equation [ eq : tau relations ] ) coincide with the relations amongst the generators of the affine symmetric group @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is explained in remarks [ rmk : taup ] and [ rmk : tau ] and also follows as an easy corollary of our main theorem . </S>",
    "<S> then we can view any mutation sequence ( word in the @xmath76 s ) , as a gallery of alcoves ( faces in the triangular lattice ) associated to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is a bijection between clusters produced by @xmath3-mutation sequences and alcoves in the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> each triangle in the lattice has edges labeled with a permutation of @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the central shaded ( purple ) triangle as the origin and label its edges starting from the top going clockwise as @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> then we label the rest of the edges in the lattice according to the following rule : given a labeled triangle @xmath79 , we label any triangle adjacent to @xmath79 by reflecting the labels over the shared edge . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a well - defined labeling on the entire lattice after choosing an initial labeling of the origin . </S>",
    "<S> beginning at the origin ( initial cluster ) , mutation by @xmath57 corresponds to moving to the adjacent alcove that shares the edge labeled @xmath12 with the origin . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a @xmath3-mutation sequence corresponds to a walk in the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> we divide this lattice into twelve regions , noting that some adjacent regions contain an overlap . </S>",
    "<S> two of these regions , which we call the * northeast * and * southwest cones * , by abuse of notation , are described more explicitly below , while the remaining four regions are rotations of the ne and sw .    </S>",
    "<S> we place coordinates on these regions in terms of what we call canonical paths . </S>",
    "<S> these constructions will be pivotal in later sections . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : oddeven ] exhibits the lattice , with certain significant marked mutation sequences drawn as paths that split the lattice into the twelve regions .    the region labeled i ( light blue ) , which we dub the * ne cone * , consists of :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> all alcoves intersected by the path @xmath68 after an even number of steps , including the original alcove containing the initial cluster . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> all alcoves intersected by the path @xmath80 strictly after its second step . </S>",

    "<S> all alcoves between those listed in the previous two bullets .    </S>",
    "<S> the region labeled vii ( orange ) , which we dub the * sw cone * , is defined similarly to include :    1 .   </S>",

    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> all alcoves between those listed in the previous two bullets .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining regions are defined as rotations and reflections of these two cones , as according to figure [ fig : oddeven ] which illustrates the decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , region i overlaps with region ii along certain alcoves in the path @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , region @xmath84 overlaps region @xmath85 for @xmath86 along the path @xmath87 for a permutation @xmath88 . by using symmetries of the brane tiling and coxeter lattice </S>",
