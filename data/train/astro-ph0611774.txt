    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most violent explosions in the universe .",
    "they are relativistic outflows launched during collapses of massive stars or mergers of compact objects .",
    "regardless of the nature of the explosion , a generic fireball shock model ( rees & mszros 1992 , 1994 ; mszros & rees 1993 , 1997 , for reviews see piran 1999 , 2005 ; mszros 2002 , 2006 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) is found successful to interpret the broad grb phenomenology . according to this model ,",
    "the ejecta is intrinsically intermittent and unsteady , and is composed of many mini - shells with a wide range of bulk lorentz factors .",
    "internal shocks ( rees & mszros 1994 ) are likely developed before the global fireball is decelerated by the ambient medium , which are generally believed to be the emission sites of the observed prompt grb emission .",
    "the fireball is decelerated at a larger distance after sweeping enough interstellar medium whose inertia becomes noticeable , and the blastwave gradually enters a self - similar deceleration regime ( blandford - mckee 1976 ) . upon deceleration , a pair of shocks forms . a long - lived forward shock propagating into the ambient medium gives",
    "rise to the long - term broad band afterglow ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ) ; and a short - lived reverse shock propagating into the ejecta itself gives rise to a possible short - term optical / ir flash and a radio flare ( mszros & rees 1997 , 1999 ; sari & piran 1999a , b ) .",
    "the relativistic ejecta are likely collimated ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the jets may have substantial angular structures ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; rossi et al . 2002 ) . this general theoretical framework has been successful to interpret most of the observational data in the pre - swift era .    the successful launch and operation of nasa s broadband ( gamma - ray , x - ray , uv & optical ) grb mission swift ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) opens a brand new era in the grb study .",
    "the prompt slewing capability of the x - ray telescope ( xrt , burrows et al .",
    "2005a ) and uv - optical telescope ( uvot , roming et al .",
    "2005 ) allows the satellite to swiftly catch the very early x - ray and uv / optical signals following the grb prompt emission detected by the burst alert telescope ( bat , barthelmy et al .",
    "the precise localizations made by xrt for the majority of the bursts make it possible for ground - based follow up observations of most bursts .",
    "we now have unprecedented information about grb afterglows , which sheds light onto many outstanding problems in the pre - swift era ( zhang & mszros 2004 for a summary ) : e.g. central engine , composition and geometric configuration of the grb fireball , and its interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "one of the major discoveries of swift is the identification of a canonical x - ray afterglow behavior ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al . 2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "2006 , chincarini et al .",
    "2005 ; see fig.1 ) .",
    "although different afterglow lightcurves may vary from one another , they are all composed of several of the five components illustrated in fig.1 .    * steep decay phase ( i ) : typically smoothly connected to the prompt emission ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005b ) , with a temporal decay slope @xmath0 or steeper ( sometimes up to @xmath1 , e.g. vaughan et al . 2006",
    "; cusumano et al . 2006 ; obrien et al . 2006 ) extending to @xmath2s .",
    "usually have a different spectral slope from the later afterglow phases .",
    "* shallow decay phase ( ii ) : typically with a temporal decay slope @xmath3 or flatter extending to @xmath4s , at which a temporal break is observed before the normal decay phase ( e.g. campana et al .",
    "2005 ; de pasquale et al .",
    "there is no spectral evolution across the break . *",
    "normal decay phase ( iii ) : usually with a decay slope @xmath5 , and usually follows the predictions of the standard afterglow model ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ; chevalier & li 2000 ) .",
    "a systematic test of the afterglow closure - relations ( e.g. table 1 of zhang & mszros 2004 ) suggests however that a fraction of bursts do not satisfy any afterglow model ( willingale et al .",
    "* post jet break phase ( iv ) : occasionally observed following the normal decay phase , typically with a decay slope @xmath6 , satisfying the predictions of the standard jet model ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ) or the structured jet model ( rossi et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang & mszros 2002 ) .",
    "* x - ray flares ( v ) : appear in nearly half of grb afterglows .",
    "sometimes multiple flares harbor in one grb .",
    "typically have very steep rising and decaying slopes ( burrows et al .",
    "2005b ; falcone et al . 2006 ; romano et al . 2006 ) with @xmath7 .",
    "appear in both long - duration ( falcone et al .",
    "2006 ) and short - duration grbs ( barthelmy et al . 2005b ; campana et al .",
    "2006a ) , and both hard grbs and soft x - ray flashes ( romano et al .",
    "2006 ) .    except for the normal decay and the jet - break phases ,",
    "all the other three components were not straightforwardly expected in the pre - swift era . as of the time of writing , the steep decay phase and x - ray flares",
    "are better understood , while the shallow decay phase is still a mystery .",
    "the generally accepted interpretation of the steep decay phase is the tail emission due to the so - called `` curvature effect '' ( fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; zhang et al . 2006 ; panaitescu et al . 2006a ; dyks et al .",
    "the basic assumption of this interpretation is that the grb emission region is disconnected from the afterglow region ( the external shock ) , and that the emission from the grb emission region ceases abruptly .",
    "this is consistent with the conjectures of internal shocks or other internal dissipation mechanisms ( e.g. magnetic fields reconnection , etc ) .",
    "since it is generally assumed that the ejecta has a conical geometry , the curvature of the radiation front causes a propagation delay for high - latitude emission from the line of sight . combining with the variation of the doppler factor at different latitudes , one gets a simple prediction @xmath8 for the emission outside the @xmath9 emission cone , where the convention @xmath10 is adopted .",
    "the salient feature of this interpretation is that it could be directly tested since both @xmath11 and @xmath12 could be measured directly from the observational data , given that two complications are treated properly ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) : first , for internal emissions , every time when the central engine restarts , the clock should be re - set to zero . in the @xmath13 lightcurves ,",
    "this usually introduces an `` artificial '' very steep decay if the grb trigger time ( which is usually taken as @xmath14 ) significantly leads the time zero point ( @xmath15 ) of the corresponding emission episode .",
    "second , the observed decay is the superposition of the curvature decay and underlying afterglow decay from the external shock .",
    "one needs to subtract the underlying afterglow contribution before performing the test .",
    "the credibility of the curvature effect interpretation to the steep decay phase is that by properly taking into account the two effects mentioned above , the steep decay is consistent with eq.([curvature ] ) with @xmath15 shifted to the beginning of the last pulse of prompt emission ( liang et al .",
    "2006 ) at least in some cases .    besides the standard curvature effect model",
    ", other interpretations for the steep decay phase have been discussed in the literature .    * in some cases , the steep - decay slope may be shallower than the expectation of the curvature effect ) , the curvature effect nonetheless takes over to define the decay slope . ] .",
    "this would suggest that the central engine may not die abruptly or the shocked region may not cool abruptly , but rather decay with time gradually , leading to a decaying afterglow related to the central engine ( fan & wei 2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "this was taken by fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to interpret the abnormal power law decay of grb 060218 ( campana et al . 2006b ) . *",
    "yamazaki et al . ( 2006 ) study the curvature effect of an inhomogeneous fireball ( mini - jets ) .",
    "they found that the decay tail is generally smooth , but sometimes could have structures , which may interpret the small - scale structure in some of the decay tails .",
    "* peer et al . (",
    "2006 ) suggest that the emission from the relativistically expanding hot plasma `` cocoon '' associated with the grb jet could also give rise to the steep decay phase observed by swift .    motivated by the discovery of the spectrally evolving tails in grb 050724 ( campana et al .",
    "2006b ) and grb 060614 ( gehrels et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2007a ) , recently zhang et al .",
    "( 2007c ) performed a systematic time - dependent spectral analysis of 17 bright steep decay tails .",
    "they found that while 7 tails show no apparent spectral evolution , the other 10 do .",
    "a simple curvature effect model invoking an angle - dependent spectral index can not interpret the data .",
    "this suggests that the curvature effect is not the sole factor to control the steep decay tail phase at least in some bursts .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2007c ) show that some of the spectrally evolving tails may be interpreted as superposition of the curvature effect tail and an underlying central engine afterglow , which is soft but decays `` normally '' .",
    "such a component has been seen in grb 060218 ( campana et al .",
    "2006b ) , which can not be interpreted by the standard external shock afterglow ( willingale et al .",
    "the strong spectral evolutions in grb 050724 , grb 060218 , and grb 060614 , however , can not be interpreted with such a model .",
    "they are interpreted as internal shock afterglows by zhang et al .",
    "( 2007c ) .",
    "the x - ray flares have the following observational properties ( burrows et al . 2005b",
    "; chincarini et al .",
    "2007 ) : rapid rise and fall times with @xmath16 ; many light curves have evidence for a same decaying afterglow component before and after the flare ; multiple flares are observed in some bursts with similar properties ; large flux increases at the flares ; typically degrading fluence of flares with time , but in rare cases ( e.g. grb 050502b ) the flare fluence could be comparable with that of the prompt emission ; flares soften as they progress ; and later flares are less energetic and more broadened than early flares .",
    "these properties generally favor the interpretation that most of them are not associated with external - shock related events .",
    "rather they are the manifestations of internal dissipations at later times , which requires restarting the grb central engine ( burrows et al . 2005b ; zhang et al . 2006 ; fan & wei 2005 ; ioka et al .",
    "2005 ; wu et al .",
    "2006 ; falcone et al . 2006 ; romano et al . 2006 ; lazzati & perna 2006 ) .",
    "compared with the external shock related models , the late internal dissipation models have the following two major advantages ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) : first , since the clock needs to be re - set each time when the central engine restarts , it is very natural to explain the very sharp rising and falling lightcurves of the flares .",
    "second , energetically the late internal dissipation model is very economical .",
    "while in the refreshed external shock models a large energy budget is needed ( the injection energy has to be at least comparable to that already in the blastwave in order to have any significant injection signature , zhang & mszros 2002 ) , the internal model only demands a small fraction of the prompt emission energy to account for the distinct flares .",
    "the leading candidate of the late internal dissipation model is the late internal shock model .",
    "in such a model , the collisions could be between the fast shells injected later and the slow shells injected earlier during the prompt phase ( e.g. zou et al .",
    "2006 ; staff et al .",
    "2006 ) or between two shells injected at later times ( see wu et al .",
    "2006 for a categorization of different types of collisions ) .",
    "one concern is whether later collisions between two slow shells injected during the prompt phase could give rise to the observed x - ray flares .",
    "this is generally not possible .",
    "the internal shock radius can be expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the initial separation between the two colliding shells , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the dimensionless velocities of the fast and slow shells , respectively , and @xmath21 is the lorentz factor of the slow shell .",
    "the second approximation is valid if @xmath22 . in order to produce late internal shocks",
    ", the two slow shells must both have a low enough lorentz factor so that at the time of collision they do not collide with the decelerating blastwave .",
    "also in order not to collide with each other earlier , their relative lorentz factor @xmath23 must be very small .",
    "when they collide , the internal energy [ @xmath24 is usually too small to give rise to significant emission ( where @xmath25 is the relative lorentz factor between the two shells ) .",
    "should such a collision occur , most likely it has no interesting observational effect ( see lazzati & perna 2006 for more detailed discussion on this issue ) .",
    "generally , in the internal shock model the observed time sequence reflects the time sequence in the central engine ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ) . as a result , the observed x - ray flares @xmath26s after the prompt emission must imply that the central engine restarts during this time span , say , as late as days after the prompt emission is over .",
    "the late internal dissipation model of x - ray flares is also tested by liang et al .",
    "the same logic of testing the steep decay component is used .",
    "the starting assumption is that the decay of x - ray flares are controlled by the curvature effect after the abrupt cessation of the internal dissipation , so that eq.([curvature ] ) is assumed to be valid . after subtracting the underlying forward shock afterglow contribution , liang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) search for the valid zero time points ( @xmath15 ) for each flare to allow the decay slope satisfying the requirement of the curvature effect model .",
    "if the hypothesis is correct , @xmath15 should be generally before the rising segment of each flare .",
    "the testing results are impressive : most of the flares indeed have their @xmath15 at the beginning of the flares .",
    "this suggests that the internal dissipation model is robust for most of the flares .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that even the late slow bump at around 1 day following the short grb 050724 ( barthelmy et al .",
    "2005c ; campana et al .",
    "2006a ) satisfies the curvature effect model , suggesting that the central engine is still active even at 1 day after the trigger .",
    "this is also consistent with the late chandra observation of this burst ( grupe et al .",
    "2006a ) that indicates that the afterglow resumes to the pre - flare decay slope after the flare .",
    "having identified the correct model for the flare phenomenology , one is asked about a fundamental question : how to restart the central engine .",
    "no central engine models in the pre - swift era have specifically predicted extended activities far after the prompt emission phase .",
    "prompted by the x - ray flare observations , the following suggestions have been made recently , and none is proved by robust numerical simulations at the moment .    *",
    "fragmentation or gravitational instabilities in the massive star envelopes .",
    "king et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that the collapse of a rapidly rotating stellar core leads to fragmentation .",

    "the properties of these x - ray flares are similar to those in long grbs .",
    "the requirement that both long and short grbs should produce x - ray flares with similar properties prompted perna et al .",

    "the accretion flow can be intermittent in nature due to the role of magnetic fields .",
    "this model does not require the flow being chopped ( e.g. due to fragmentation or gravitational instabilities ) at larger radii before accretion , although in reality both processes may occur altogether .",

    "2006 ; willingale et al .",
    "it is very likely related to the external - shock - origin afterglow .",
    "however , the origin of this shallow decay phase is more difficult to identify , since there exist several different possibilities that are not easy to differentiate among each other from the x - ray observations .",
    "the fact that the spectral index does not change across the temporal break from the shallow decay phase to the normal decay phase rules out the models that invoke crossing of a spectral break across the band .",

    "following models have been discussed in the literature .",
    "* energy injection invoking a long - term central engine .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the `` shallower - than - normal '' phase is that the total energy in the external shock continuously increases with time .",
    "this requires substantial energy injection into the fireball during the phase ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "there are two possible energy injection schemes ( zhang et al . 2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "the first one is to simply invoke a long - lasting central engine , with a smoothly varying luminosity , e.g. @xmath29 ( e.g. zhang & mszros 2001 ) . in order to give interesting injection signature @xmath30",
    "is required ; otherwise the total energy in the blastwave essentially does not increase with time .",
    "such a possibility is valid for the central engines invoking a spinning down pulsar ( dai & lu 1998 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; fan & xu 2006 ) or a long - lasting bh - torus system ( macfadyen et al .",
    "one possible signature of this scenario that differentiates it from the varying-@xmath31 model discussed below is that a strong relativistic reverse shock is usually expected , if at the shock interacting region the @xmath32-parameter ( the ratio between the poynting flux and the kinetic flux ) is degraded to below unity ( dai 2004 ; yu & dai 2006 ) .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath32 is still high at the shock region , the reverse shock may be initially weak , but would still become relativistic if the engine lasts long enough ( i.e. this is effectively a rather thick shell , zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) .",

    "this model invokes a distribution of the lorentz factor of the ejecta with low-@xmath31 ejecta lagging behind the high-@xmath31 ones , and only piling up to the blastwave when the high-@xmath31 part is decelerated ( rees & mszros 1998 ) . in order to produce a smooth power law decay",

    "analyses show that at the early deceleration time , xrfs are as efficient as harder grbs ( see also schady et al .",

    "this suggests that ghirlanda relation is not a common relation satisfied by most bursts .",
    "this fact however does not disfavor the liang - zhang relation , since an optical break may still exist at the expected time if the breaks are chromatic .",
    "late time optical observations are needed to test whether the liang - zhang relation is generally valid / violated for most bursts .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in several cases , the x - ray data are consistent with having a jet break .",

    "the data seem to suggest that there might exist other types of temporal breaks at least for some bursts that are not related to jet breaks .",
    "a very interesting feature of the afterglow breaks is that the x - ray breaks systematically lead the optical breaks , which in turn systematically lead the radio breaks .",
    "this fact , along with the chromatic breaks in both x - rays ( e.g. panaitescu et al .",
    "2006b ) and optical ( e.g. monfardini et al .",
    "2006 ) , drives the author to speculate an ad hoc scenario to interpret these temporal breaks as well as the liang - zhang ( @xmath85 ) relation . in this scenario ,",
    "the spectral break in the prompt gamma - ray emission ( @xmath77 ) and the chromatic temporal breaks in the afterglow lightcurves may be all related to a same electron energy distribution break that rolls down from high energy to low energy . initially the break is in the gamma - ray band , which defines the @xmath77 in the prompt emission spectrum . later this break moves to the x - ray band in @xmath86 s , giving rise to the early injection - like breaks in some bursts .",
    "the break keeps moving down to the optical band around a day , which can account for the pre - swift optical breaks that were interpreted as jet breaks .",
    "later it moves to the radio band in @xmath87 days .",
    "such a scenario gives a natural link between @xmath77 and the optical break time @xmath82 in the liang - zhang relation , which is otherwise difficult to explain .",
    "there are several problems with this scenario , however .",
    "first , it requires that for the bursts of interests the prompt emission and the afterglows are from the same emission component .",
    "this is in contradiction with the swift finding that prompt emission and x - ray flares are of the internal origin while afterglows are of external origin ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "nonetheless , maybe some bursts indeed satisfy this requirement .",
    "if so , either the prompt emission of these bursts are of external origin , or more possibly , the afterglows of these bursts are of internal origin , i.e. they are the central engine afterglows .",
    "second , a natural expectation of this scenario is that the spectral indices before and after the breaks should be different .",
    "this seems to contradict with the x - ray data that suggest no spectral evolution across the early break is observed .",
    "however , the latest systematic study of temporal breaks ( willingale et al . 2006 ) suggest that spectral changes in some breaks are observed .",
    "it is interesting to look closer whether those bursts with spectral evolution are also consistent with both prompt emission and afterglow being from the same emission component , and therefore might satisfy the temporal break scenario suggested here .",
    "other than these difficulties , this new scenario seems to be able to account for chromatic breaks observed in some afterglows .",
    "a hard test of this scenario is to find some bursts that have a break crossing through the x - ray , optical and radio bands in turn .",
    "although no clear example is available in the swift data sample , the previous grb 030329 may satisfy the requirement of this model .",
    "it has been claimed that there are two `` jet breaks '' in this burst ( berger et al .",
    "2003a ) : an early optical break and a later radio break .",
    "these two breaks were used to argue a two - component jet model for this burst . within the scenario proposed here ,",
    "the two breaks are simply the same break rolling over the optical and radio bands at different times .",
    "similar to the liang - zhang relation that connects @xmath77 with the optical break time @xmath88 , this scenario also predicts a correlation between @xmath77 and the x - ray break times @xmath89 .",
    "such a correlation seems to have been revealed in the swift data ( willingale et al .",
    "swift opens a new window to study the global properties of grb afterglows . although some model predictions are verified by the new data ( it is impressive that many x - ray afterglows satisfy the closure relations predicted in simple external shock models ) , what we gain more from the swift observations are problems that challenge the previous theoretical framework .",
    "it is evident that our view about grb afterglows is now much broader than in the pre - swift era .",
    "we tentatively draw the following conclusions .",
    "* what we call afterglows actually include two distinct components : one is from the traditional external shock , the other is from the central engine .",
    "it is evident that some flaring components ( most x - ray flares and probably some optical flares ) are of internal origin , marking the reactivation of the central engine .",
    "however , one may be driven to accept that some of the smooth power law decay components may also reflect the emission from the central engine .",
    "this is relevant to some xrt lightcurves that do not satisfy any closure relation , and to some chromatic breaks that are difficult to accommodate within the standard external shock models . if some of the power - law decay lightcurves directly reflect the luminosity output of the central engine , one has to accept that the grb central engine is long lived , not only erratically ( to produce flares ) , but in some cases also continuously ( to produce the smooth decay component ) .",
    "the latter is consistent with the first energy injection model ( the refreshed shock model ) that invokes a long - term central engine . *",
    "the most puzzling question is the nature of grb afterglow temporal breaks .",
    "the current data suggest that some breaks are still _ consistent with _ being jet breaks , but in a lot of other cases conflicts present .",
    "the pre - swift relations invoking jet breaks ( frail and ghirlanda relations ) are not confirmed by the swift data .",
    "evidence of chromatic breaks in both x - ray and optical bands is accumulating .",
    "at least for some bursts , one may require new interpretations ( such as the one proposed in  4.3 ) for the observed temporal breaks .",
    "since the nature of breaks is one of the major puzzles in the concurrent grb study , late time optical follow up observations are strongly encouraged to reveal whether optical breaks as predicted by the @xmath90 ( liang - zhang ) relation still exist despite of the apparent lack of x - ray breaks at the same epoch .",
    "this would make a strong case for whether the previous `` jet breaks '' are in fact chromatic breaks .",
    "* it is now high time to perform systematic data analyses of the abundant swift grb data to peer into the global properties of the bursts . while one can still gain knowledge from special individual events ( such as grb 060218 and grb 060614 ) , for most of the `` normal '' bursts , only global statistical properties can serve to improve our understanding of grbs .",
    "issues need to clarify include the properties and nature of broadband flares / bumps , temporal breaks , the compatibility of data with closure relations , etc .",
