    "thermal rectification ( tr ) @xcite is an important property that has been extensively studied in a variety of nonlinear systems @xcite in recent times .",
    "a thermally driven system can be so designed such that the thermal current through the system has unequal values when direction of thermal bias is reversed - the heat conduction is asymmetric .",
    "thus the system behaves as a good heat conductor in one direction and a good insulator in the opposite direction .",
    "thermal rectification owes its origin to the nonlinearity of the system and to its spatial asymmetry .",
    "analogous to its electrical counterpart , the thermal rectifier is considered to be a crucial building block and therefore has an important role to play in the fabrication of sophisticated thermal devices .",
    "negative differential thermal resistance ( ndtr ) @xcite is a counter intuitive phenomenon , predicted in the heat conduction studies , where the steady state thermal current decreases as the temperature difference across a system is increased . in the recent decades",
    "a lot of attention has been devoted to study ndtr in nonlinear lattices .",
    "however , in spite of enormous efforts the underlying physical mechanism that generates ndtr in nonlinear system is still not satisfactorily understood .",
    "a lot of mechanisms have been proposed and many unresolved questions regarding the emergence of ndtr , such as the mismatch of the phonon bands @xcite , role of interface @xcite , ballistic - diffusive transport @xcite , role of momentum conservation @xcite presence of a critical system size and a transition from the exhibition to the nonexhibition of ndtr @xcite and scaling @xcite are still being explored .",
    "ndtr is considered to be of immense technological importance in the working of recently proposed thermal devices such as the thermal transistors @xcite , thermal logic gates @xcite , thermal memory elements @xcite etc .",
    "theoretical studies using mostly numerical simulation have been employed extensively to study both these feature in many nonlinear lattice systems , few examples are the frenkel - kontorova model @xcite , the @xmath2 model @xcite , the fermi - pasta - ulam chain @xcite , the morse lattice @xcite .",
    "linear systems , such as the coupled harmonic oscillators , do not exhibit tr or ndtr .",
    "surprisingly it has been recently found that linear graded systems , such as a harmonic oscillator chain with linearly increasing masses , show both tr and ndtr @xcite .",
    "in fact , gradual mass - loaded carbon and boron nitride nanotubes have already been used effectively to fabricate a thermal rectifier @xcite .",
    "these functional graded materials have been considered to be of huge technological relevance since these materials can be purposely manufactured and have many intriguing optical , electrical , mechanical and thermal properties @xcite .    motivated by the concept of these functional graded materials , in this paper , we study thermal transport in the classical heisenberg model @xcite coupled to heat baths and in presence of a spatially varying magnetic field , and investigate tr and ndtr . both of these features have been shown to emerge in the heisenberg spin chain previously @xcite but by a different approach ; in this paper we present a new route to obtain these features .",
    "investigation of tr and ndtr in spin systems have been carried out only in a very few other works such as the two dimensional classical ising model @xcite and quantum spin systems @xcite very recently .",
    "these systems are quite simple and although they are helpful in understanding the underlying physical mechanism , nevertheless these are not very realistic ; the heisenberg model is a comparatively more realistic spin model for a magnetic insulator . also , in both cases the system under consideration consists of two dissimilar segments coupled to each other .",
    "this scheme requires one to carefully fabricate the junction as it has been argued that tr and ndtr are crucially dependent on the junction properties @xcite which is difficult to implement this in real systems .",
    "it was also initially believed that ndtr can not be obtained in a symmetric system @xcite .",
    "however later studies clearly showed that ndtr can be obtained from systems even without structural inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our proposal is that it is much simpler to implement , easy to manipulate over a wide range , and should also be realizable in practice .",
    "firstly , one does not need to specially design the system , unlike the case of two segment nonlinear lattices ( with an interface ) or graded systems mentioned above - one has to fabricate such a system with precise specifications which might be technologically more challenging and restrictive in applicability .",
    "secondly , using spin systems one can control tr and ndtr over a wide range by tuning only an external magnetic field and so , in contrast to previous works , no special engineering of the system is required in our case .",
    "tr in this system also shows interesting anomalous dependences , as we shall discuss , that can be of technological relevance .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in the next section sec [ model ]",
    "we describe our model and the numerical scheme employed to study the system .",
    "thereafter we present our results in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "finally , in sec [ conclusion ] we conclude with a brief summary of our results and a discussion .",
    "consider classical heisenberg spins @xmath3 ( three - dimensional unit vectors ) on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath1 @xmath4 with nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath5 where the spin - spin interaction are taken to interact ferromagnetically @xmath6 ( we have set @xmath7 to unity for our results without any loss of generality ) . the second term in eq . ( [ ham ] ) is due to a spatially varying magnetic field @xmath8 that acts on all the spins .",
    "the equation for the time evolution of the spin vectors can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) is the local molecular field experienced by @xmath12-th spin vector .    to drive the system out of equilibrium we couple the ends of the system to two heat baths .",
    "this is implemented by introducing to additional spins at sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the bonds between ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) at two extreme ends of the system behave as stochastic thermal baths .",
    "the left and right thermal baths are in equilibrium at their respective temperatures , @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the bond energies @xmath19 and @xmath20 have boltzmann distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the average energies of the two extreme bonds read @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the standard langevin function .",
    "we investigate the steady state transport properties of the heisenberg model by numerically computing the steady state thermal current using the discrete time odd even ( dtoe ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "the dtoe dynamics alternately updates the spins belonging to the odd and even sites of the lattice using a spin precession dynamics given by @xmath25_{i , t } \\label{precess}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the time - step increment @xcite .",
    "numerically , the leftmost spin @xmath29 is updated with the even spins and the rightmost spin @xmath30 is updated with the odd ( even ) spins for even ( odd ) @xmath1 .",
    "the bond energy between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is refreshed from a boltzmann distribution and thereafter the spin @xmath31 is reconstructed using the relation @xmath33 .",
    "note that , during this update @xmath32 is not modified ( as it belongs to the odd sublattice ) .",
    "similarly the other end is also updated .",
    "this sets the temperatures of the two ends of the lattice to our desired values",
    ". a thorough discussion of the dtoe scheme and numerical implementation of the thermal baths can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the computation of the steady state thermal current is done as described in the following .",
    "the energy of the @xmath12-th bond @xmath34 measured after the odd spin update is not equal to @xmath35 measured after the subsequent even spin update , where @xmath36 $ ] is the energy density .",
    "this difference @xmath37 is the measure of the energy crossing the @xmath12-th bond in time @xmath28 ( we set @xmath28 to unity @xcite ) .",
    "the steady state thermal current @xmath38 ( rate of flow of energy ) is site independent and is computed in this scheme @xcite using @xmath39 note that eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) is consistent with the definition of current obtained from the continuity equation @xcite .",
    "we define a total current @xmath40 and all the results obtained are presented below in terms of this total current .",
    "the temperature of the two thermal baths are set as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , thus the average temperature of the system is @xmath43 .",
    "the spatially varying magnetic field @xmath8 is chosen as @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a linearly varying field where @xmath46 ; we set @xmath47 for all our results in this section .",
    "starting from a random initial configuration of spins we let the system evolve using the dtoe dynamics until a steady state is reached and thereafter compute the thermal current using eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) .",
    "we consider the system to be in _ forward _ bias for @xmath48 and in _ backward _",
    "bias for @xmath49 .",
    "the thermal current under the forward bias @xmath50 and that in the backward bias @xmath51 are different in magnitude as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rect]a .",
    "note that the system is perfectly symmetric and homogeneous .",
    "the asymmetric heat conduction is completely brought about by the spatially varying magnetic field .",
    "we define the rectification ratio as @xmath52 which measure the of the amount of tr achieved .",
    "thus for poor rectification @xmath53 is close to unity and for good rectification @xmath53 is very large ( small ) if @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : rect]b , as expected @xmath53 is found to increase as @xmath56 is increased i.e. , when the magnetic field varies more sharply across the system ( apart from some discrepancies for large @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus heat conduction is asymmetric i.e. @xmath58 and the system exhibits tr .",
    "-0.33 cm -0.175 cm    -0.3 cm -0.15 cm +    an interesting feature of tr in this system is the variation of the rectification ratio @xmath59 with the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the rectification ratio does not increase indefinitely as @xmath56 is increased but rather shows an intriguing nonmonotonic @xmath56 dependence . for different values of the thermal bias @xmath57 we compute @xmath53 as a function of @xmath56 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl]a . for @xmath56 in the range @xmath60",
    ", we find @xmath61 initially whereas for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 lies roughly in the range @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl]a ) . for small @xmath57 , @xmath53 increases roughly linearly for @xmath66 , then drops abruptly below @xmath67 and then increases linearly towards unity again . for larger @xmath57",
    ", @xmath53 has an even more complicated nonmonotonic @xmath56 dependence but jumps from @xmath68 to @xmath69 at the same @xmath70 .",
    "we look into the temperature dependence of @xmath53 which is also very unusual . generally rectification is found to deteriorate as the average temperature of the system is increased @xcite . however in our case tr for higher temperature in certain range(s ) of @xmath56 is actually higher than that for lower temperature as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl]b . also note that @xmath64 shifts to higher @xmath56 values as the average temperature is increased .",
    "similar nontrivial dependence is seen when one studies the variation of @xmath53 with the system size @xmath1 . in some @xmath56 regime",
    ", @xmath53 decreases as @xmath1 is increased whereas in some other regime we get an _ anomalous _ size dependence as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl]c .",
    "thus , depending on which @xmath56 range one is in , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependences can be normal ( @xmath53 approaching unity as @xmath0 and @xmath71 increases ) or anomalous .",
    "this seems to be due to a complicated interplay of the imposed thermal bias and the spatially varying magnetic field .     and @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the vertical arrows represent the spatially varying magnetic field which grows monotonically as one moves from the left end of the system towards the right end.,width=264 ]    -0.4 cm -0.4 cm +    to understand this we look into the individual currents @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "for relatively small values of the magnetic field the current @xmath74 is higher when it flows from a higher magnetic field region to a lower magnetic field region .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnetic field tries to restrict the motion of the spins and thereby inhibits the flow of energy through the system .",
    "now according to our definition , in the forward bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pic]a ) the magnetic field increases as one approaches the colder bath - thus the motion of the spins nearer to the right end of the system is doubly restricted - one because of the low temperature and the other due to the higher magnetic fields . for the backward bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pic]b ) however the effect of the higher magnetic field is somewhat compensated by the hotter bath and the spins are relatively more free to rotate in this case and therefore the system has a higher current . since in the steady state",
    "the current through the system is a site independent constant ( a consequence of the equation of continuity ) the overall current of the system is dictated by the current carrying capacity of the _ weakest _ bond ( corresponding to the most restricted spin ) and therefore the current in the forward bias is lower than that in the backward bias .",
    "this explain why @xmath75 for @xmath66 , as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - jtl]a , and the rectification ratio @xmath61 ; @xmath53 increases in this region as @xmath56 is increased because of increased asymmetry of the system .",
    "as the magnetic field increases the current starts to decrease since the orientational _ stiffness _ of the spins increases which restricts energy passage through the system .",
    "as the magnetic field becomes high the system goes into a magnetic field dominated regime which limits the current carrying capacity of the system - the weaker current @xmath50 attains a saturation first while the relatively stronger @xmath51 still continues to decrease but eventually it too attains a saturation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r - jtl]a ) ( note that , in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - jtl ] the y - axis is a logarithmic scale in all the figures ) .",
    "for a lower temperature the spins of the system are more orientationally stiff and thus this domination of the magnetic field commences at a lower value of @xmath56 .",
    "the current saturates at lower @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r - jtl]b ) and this explains the decrease of @xmath64 as the average temperature is decreased in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl]b . with regards to the value of @xmath64",
    "there is no appreciable variation as the system size @xmath1 is altered as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : r - jtl]c and also previously in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl]c .",
    "the system of smaller size is closer to the ballistic limit and carries slightly more current than a system of larger size @xcite .",
    "the system approaches a diffusive transport regime as the temperature @xmath0 or the size @xmath1 is increases @xcite , but in the forward bias condition the approach is obviously slower than in the forward bias .",
    "this is the reason that one obtains an improvement of rectification ( @xmath53 moves away from unity as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl]b , c ) as @xmath0 or @xmath1 is increased in the @xmath76 regime .",
    "also , as we shall show in the following , it is the motion of the @xmath1th spin that decides the value of @xmath64 which therefore is independent of the length of the system to which it belongs .",
    "this is why @xmath64 remains essentially unchanged as the system size @xmath1 is altered and changes only when the average temperature @xmath0 is changed .",
    "thus to summarize , there are two regimes corresponding to the two terms in the hamiltonian ( eq . [ ham ] ) : ( a ) a spin - spin interaction dominated regime ( or in other words , a temperature dominated regime ) in the parameter range @xmath77 in which the current steadily decrease as @xmath56 increases , and ( b ) a magnetic field dominated regime for @xmath76 in which the spins have a restricted motion and the current through the system changes very negligibly as @xmath56 is varied .",
    "it is the complicated interplay of these two mutually opposing factors that gives rise to the interesting features that are observed in our system .",
    "-0.3 cm + -0.3 cm    in order to validate the picture just presented we look into the microscopic dynamics of the individual spins now . since the most restricted spin dictates the current ( as discussed above ) we look into the @xmath78 component of the @xmath1th spin ( since the @xmath1th spin experiences the largest magnetic field amongst all the spins ) and show its distribution @xmath79 as a function of the parameter @xmath56 in fig . [ fig : sd]a . since @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is the polar angle and the spins being of unit magnitude )",
    ", @xmath78 lies in the range @xmath82 $ ] . for a spin which is completely free to orient itself in all possible directions",
    ", the distribution would be uniform in the range @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "however in presence of a finite temperature and an external magnetic field @xmath79 has an exponential form .",
    "note that , as @xmath56 increases , the slope of the distribution @xmath83 increases which signifies that the spin motion gets more and more restricted . from the distribution we compute the average @xmath84 and the standard deviation @xmath85 for the @xmath1th spin .",
    "these two quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd]b and fig .",
    "[ fig : sd]c respectively .",
    "the average @xmath84 approaches unity @xmath56 increases for both the forward and backward bias conditions , and @xmath86 .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath87 is an indicator of how freely a spin can rotate about the magnetic field .",
    "thus larger the @xmath87 is the more is the current @xmath74 that the spin allows to pass through . fig .",
    "[ fig : sd]c shows that @xmath87 for forward and backward bias decreases as @xmath56 increases although not always monotonically for all parameters . ( for the chosen parameters for the figure , @xmath87 approximately fits to the form @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are constants - both @xmath89 and @xmath90 values are higher for @xmath50 than @xmath51 ) .",
    "-0.15 cm    -0.3 cm -0.3 cm + -1.4 cm    to obtain a numerical estimate of @xmath64 where the rectification ratio @xmath59 shows a jump and the current attains saturation , we compute the ratio of the two @xmath87 values , @xmath91 , and study its variation as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "it is found that @xmath92 increases steadily till some @xmath56 value in the range @xmath93 and thereafter it attains constancy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sd]d ) .",
    "this is indeed where the magnetic field overpowers the thermal motion of the spins that we have encountered earlier - the individual currents attain saturation and the rectification ratio jumps from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "in fact all the features that we have observed in fig . [ fig : rtl]a can be understood from the @xmath56 variation of @xmath92 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_ndt ] we show @xmath92 as a function of @xmath56 for different values of @xmath94 and @xmath57 .",
    "we find that @xmath64 remains the same for different system sizes @xmath1 and bias @xmath57 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_ndt]a , c ) and shifts only when the average temperature @xmath0 is varied ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_ndt]b ) . also note that the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath53 that is observed for @xmath95 in some of the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : rtl ] can be clearly seen in the plot for @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_ndt]c ) .",
    "thus the physical picture that we had proposed to explain the features observed in rectification is corroborated by the results obtained from simulation .",
    "thermal rectification , as exhibited by this system , shows several intriguing features that have not been observed or investigated in any of the previous works of rectification and can have a lot of technological implications in the fabrication of thermal devices .",
    "it will also be interesting to see if such peculiar dependences arise in other graded systems .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the emergence of ndtr in this system . note that the current @xmath74 in a strictly non - decreasing function of @xmath57 as has been obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : rect ] . to make this system exhibit ndtr",
    ", we keep the temperature of one bath fixed and change the temperature of the other bath ; we set @xmath96 and @xmath97 . the magnetic field is chosen to be linearly varying in space @xmath45 as in the previous section .",
    "the variation of the total thermal current @xmath74 with @xmath57 for different values of the parameter @xmath56 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dhh0]a .",
    "when @xmath98 i.e. , with an uniform magnetic field throughout the system , the current @xmath74 sharply increases as @xmath57 is increased and there is no ndtr ( data not shown ) .",
    "this is due to the absence of any mechanism to restrict the passage of energy in the bulk of the system which is required in order to observe ndtr @xcite .",
    "-0.5 cm -0.5 cm    as @xmath56 is increased , the system exhibits ndtr for some nonzero value of @xmath56 .",
    "thus by simply tuning the external magnetic field one obtains ndtr in this system without the need to manipulate parameters of the system . for a fixed nonzero value of @xmath56",
    "one can also obtain ndtr by tuning @xmath99 as has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dhh0]b . the physical mechanism that gives rise",
    "to ndtr is the obstruction to the flow of current by the magnetic field as has been discussed in detail in a previous work @xcite .",
    "note that when the magnetic field is increased ( either by increasing @xmath56 or @xmath99 ) further to larger values the current becomes very small and the ndtr regime disappears .",
    "the temperature dependence of ndtr is described in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmul]a .",
    "it is seen that the point of emergence of ndtr @xmath100 shifts to larger values of @xmath57 as temperature increases .",
    "the value of the energy current increases too as the temperature is increased . from the main figure we find that the @xmath101 curves show an excellent data collapse when the axes are rescaled as @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; for the chosen set of parameters @xmath104 and @xmath100 is the point where ndtr regime commences corresponding to the maximum value of current .",
    "-0.425 cm -0.53 cm    as has been commonly seen in previous works , ndtr becomes more pronounced as the system size @xmath1 is decreased . here",
    "too , we find that the point of commencement of ndtr gradually shifts towards larger values of @xmath57 as the system size is increased .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmul]b .",
    "the decrease of the ndtr regime due to increase in system size can however be compensated by decreasing the temperature or increasing the magnetic field suitably .",
    "we have also verified the emergence of ndtr in this system for other spatial dependence of the magnetic field . with an exponentially varying magnetic field of the form",
    "@xmath105 we find a clear ndtr regime as @xmath56 is increased from zero ( data not shown ) .",
    "to summarise our main results , we have studied thermal rectification ( tr ) and negative differential thermal resistance ( ndtr ) in the one dimensional classical heisenberg model under thermal bias with a spatially varying magnetic field .",
    "systematic analysis of tr with respect to system parameters reveal intriguing dependences with respect to temperature and system size . for certain range of system parameters ndtr can be observed .",
    "both the features emerge and can be controlled by the external magnetic field unlike the previous works where one had to prepare the system with specific parameter values .",
    "heat transport in magnetic system assisted by classical spin waves have been predicted several years back @xcite and has also been experimentally observed recently in yttrium iron garnet @xcite .",
    "transport studies in spin systems are also of active experimental interest in recent times @xcite .",
    "actual chemical compounds @xcite that mimic classical spin interactions , such as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , are already known for quite some time now . apart from carbon nanotubes which are considered suitable for fabricating thermal devices , this present work ( and also @xcite ) suggests these spin materials to be another promising candidate .",
    "hopefully , with the recent advancement in low dimensional experimental techniques , these theoretical predictions would be verified experimentally and lead to the efficient thermal management in future .        b. hu , d. he l. yang and y. zhang , phys .",
