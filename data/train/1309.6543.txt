    "transverse pattern formation , autosolitons and cavity solitons have been the subject of intense research in nonlinear optics in the last two decades since their original predictions @xcite . unlike in other fields of science ,",
    "transverse patterns and dissipative solitons find useful applications in photonics such as optical memories , delay lines and optical registers @xcite .",
    "cavity solitons counterparts in the propagation direction have also been shown to generate passive mode - locking in fiber lasers @xcite .",
    "formation of transverse spatial structures in quadratic nonlinear cavities was predicted first in optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) @xcite and later extended to second harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "early predictions in opos were confined to the degenerate case where signal and idler fields have the same frequency .",
    "experimental evidence of pattern formation was indeed found in triply resonant degenerate opos close to the confocal cavity configuration @xcite and via conical emissions @xcite .",
    "confirmation of the predictions of @xcite was provided in a broad - aperture degenerate opos in a plane - mirror mini - cavity @xcite .",
    "degenerate opos also display phase domain dynamics and dark - ring cavity solitons @xcite .",
    "finally , opo models for non - degenerate type - ii cases in doubly or triply resonant cavity configurations have also been shown to display self - organization and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "transverse instabilities in the case of non - degenerate , singly resonant opos ( sropos ) , where the signal field is the only resonated field in an optical cavity , have been less discussed in the literature . on the theoretical side pattern formation in sropos",
    "is expected to replicate results of the complex ginzburg - landau laser case @xcite . on the experimental side cw sropo configurations",
    "are notoriously difficult to operate because of high oscillation thresholds ( typically several watts ) in common birefringent crystals @xcite .",
    "quasi - phase matching in periodically poled materials has , however , considerably reduced operation thresholds of cw sropos @xcite allowing for diode @xcite and fiber @xcite laser pumping for spectroscopy applications .",
    "a major advantage of cw sropos is that their wide tunability is monotonic and not affected by mode jumps typical of doubly or triply resonant configurations .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the formation and dynamics of transverse structures in sropos .",
    "we first derive a mean - field model in section [ mfl ] where the nonlinearity is of sinc@xmath0 form in agreement with early studies of sropo steady states emissions @xcite .",
    "the analysis builds on approaches that describe and integrate the propagation equations inside the opo crystal @xcite by considering transverse effects and by carefully separating the mean - field and close - to - threshold approximations .",
    "the final model equations are capable of describing transverse pattern formation in the presence of pump depletion , signal - idler recombination and external seeding close to the signal frequency .",
    "external seeding proves to be of fundamental importance for transverse structures in sropos since , in its absence , changes of the cavity length are compensated by changes in the signal ( and idler ) frequency thus nullifying the common mechanism of turing pattern formation in off - resonant optical systems @xcite .    in section [ pwss ] plane - wave steady states and their stability are analyzed in the sropo models with external seeding , close to and far from threshold .",
    "these studies confirm that no pattern formation should be expected without a detuned external seed .",
    "analytical expressions for the location in the parameter space of the loss of stability of homogeneous solutions to spatially modulated structures are then provided in section [ tupf ] .",
    "the thresholds for pattern formation when changing the seeding intensity are then compared with those obtained from numerical integration of the sropo dynamical equations with excellent agreement .",
    "section [ otcs ] investigates when spatially periodic spatial structures break down to either optical turbulence for small seeding intensities or to cavity solitons for large pump and seeding intensities .",
    "optical turbulence is demonstrated to be the mechanism which generates rogue waves in the spatio - temporal evolution of the output fields .",
    "finally , bright and dark cavity solitons are found in multistable configurations with localized hexagonal and honeycomb patterns .",
    "we consider parametric down conversion in a @xmath1 crystal of length @xmath2 at perfect phase matching , a condition that can also describe the average effect of quasi - phase matching in periodically poled crystals . in this case",
    "the propagation of the pump , signal and idler fields in the crystal along the @xmath3 direction are described by @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 are the slowly varying amplitudes of pump , signal and idler fields , respectively , with wave - numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the transverse laplacian operator along the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions perpendicular to the propagation axis @xmath3 .",
    "the frequency constraint @xmath11 is rewritten as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the effective coupling parameter @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath1 is the second order susceptibility of the crystal , @xmath17 is the common refractive index of the three waves that guarantees phase matching and @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum .     with a single partially reflecting mirror @xmath19 and containing a parametric down - conversion crystal of length @xmath2 . ]",
    "we assume that the parametric down conversion crystal is contained in an optical cavity of length @xmath20 where the signal field is the only one to be resonated ( see figure [ fig : sropo ] ) .",
    "the steps involved in taking the mean - field approximation are the same as those reported in @xcite although in the sropo case there is only one resonated field .",
    "the final equation for the normalized signal field reads as : @xmath21 where we have introduced @xmath22 and the parameters @xmath23 here , @xmath19 is the output mirror reflectivity , @xmath24 is the frequency of the longitudinal cavity mode closest to the signal frequency @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a complex input field of frequency @xmath27 close to @xmath25 , normally known as the seeding .",
    "the usual mean - field limit procedure requires high reflectivity @xmath19 and involves an expansion in longitudinal fourier modes and the requirement that all terms , including the nonlinear one , are independent of the longitudinal variable @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath28variation per pass of the resonated signal field , @xmath29 , can be neglected when it is affected by the average of the propagation of the pump and idler waves along the crystal @xcite , i.e. @xmath30 to obtain an explicit dependence of pump and idler fields along the direction of propagation we consider the first and third equations of the system ( [ propequ ] ) and neglect diffraction in the crystal : @xmath31 where the signal amplitude @xmath29 is now independent of @xmath3 . by taking the second derivative of ( [ eqn : s1 ] ) and using ( [ eqn : s2 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath32 which shows that the pump field oscillates along the propagation direction with a frequency that depends on the signal intensity @xmath33 . integrating this equation we find @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the amplitude of the pump field at the entrance of the crystal @xcite . from ( [ eqn : s1 ] ) , @xmath36 in agreement again with @xcite .",
    "we can now calculate the spatial average ( [ average ] ) : @xmath37 and insert it into ( [ mfl2 ] ) : @xmath38 by expanding in longitudinal fourier modes and retaining only the longitudinal mode closest to @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath39 , we finally obtain : @xmath40 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 finally , we renormalize the transverse space variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 by dividing them by @xmath42 , the time variable by multiplying it by @xmath43 and the field amplitudes according to @xmath44 to obtain @xmath45 the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ sropo ] ) is the main focus of the research presented here .",
    "it will be referred to as the _ sinc@xmath0 model _ since @xmath46 .",
    "we note that in sropo configurations the frequency of the signal field , @xmath25 , is tuneable by corresponding changes of the idler frequency , @xmath47 , while maintaining the energy conservation condition @xmath48 .",
    "this means that with no external seeding ( @xmath49 ) the detuning @xmath50 is also zero since the sropo tunes its signal frequency to the closest longitudinal cavity mode @xmath24 . with an external seeding different from zero and",
    "detuned with respect to the cavity , it is advantageous to consider the external frequency @xmath27 as reference and introduce @xmath51 under these conditions @xmath26 should be considered to be real and equation ( [ sropo ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the behavior of the pump and idler fields inside the opo crystal as provided by eqs .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cp ] shows the pump and idler intensities during propagation for three sample values of @xmath52 , namely 1.2 , 2.0 and 8.0 . while at @xmath53 ( black lines ) the changes of pump and idler per pass are limited , for @xmath54 ( red lines ) and @xmath55 ( blue lines ) they are substantial .",
    "in particular , full pump depletion and substantial back - conversion of signal and idler fields into the pump are clearly visible in figure [ fig : cp ] for @xmath55 . in the sropo case",
    "these phenomena are not incompatible with the mean field approximation and are at the base of the sinc@xmath0 nonlinearity of model ( [ sropo ] ) .",
    "the mean field approximation implies that the signal intensity remains almost constant with respect to its input value during propagation in the @xmath1 medium with large changes taking place over several cavity round - trips .",
    "no such constrains apply to pump and idler fields as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] .",
    "note that the cos@xmath0 and sin@xmath0 nature of the pump and idler intensities , respectively , guarantees conservation of the energy density in every point along the sropo crystal .",
    "energy conservation in turn guarantees the validity of the manley - rowe relations about the variations of the energy densities @xmath56 per field along the crystal : @xmath57 since @xmath58 .",
    "these facts are a - posteriori confirmations that the physical processes described in eqs .",
    "( [ propequ ] ) are compatible with the application of the mean - field limit to the signal field even for large values of the pump and seeding intensities .",
    "close to the signal generation threshold it is possible to obtain partial differential equations in the mean - field limit where the nonlinear terms are in a polynomial form and thus easier to analyze .",
    "the scaling of the mean field limit requires that the nonlinear coefficient per pass , @xmath59 , has to be of the order of the mirror transmittivity , @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that the argument of the @xmath61 term in equation ( [ av2 ] ) may become large for large signal intensities without breaking the mean - field conditions .",
    "close to threshold , however , the signal intensity satisfies @xmath62 and the @xmath61 term can be approximated by a power expansion . in this",
    "case pump and idler display small changes per pass across the crystal meaning that pump depletion and back - conversion do not take place in a single pass .",
    "equations ( [ e0 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , however , tell us that while the pump can be approximated to first order to a constant value @xmath35 , the idler has to grow along @xmath3 from its initial value .",
    "this is in agreement with previous analysis below threshold where the important noise term is associated with the idler fluctuations at the entrance of the crystal @xcite . in the case of sropos close to threshold , we can approximate @xmath63 and @xmath64 in ( [ e0 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) with @xmath65 by using these expressions to evaluate the average ( [ average ] ) one obtains : @xmath66 by repeating the same steps of the mean - field limit as described in the previous subsection we obtain : @xmath67 which describes the spatio - temporal behaviour of the sropo close to threshold in the presence of an external seeding @xmath26 and will be referred to as the _ cubic model_.",
    "as mentioned in section [ mfl ] , when there is no external seeding , @xmath49 , the detuning is zero since the sropo automatically adjusts its frequency to the closest cavity resonance . the plane wave steady - state intensities , @xmath68 , are implicit for the sinc@xmath0 model ( see @xcite ) and explicit for the cubic model : @xmath69 the steady - state signal intensity of the sropo as a function of the pump intensity , @xmath52 , is shown in figure [ fig : ss ] for the sinc@xmath0 model ( solid line ) and the cubic approximation ( dashed line ) .",
    "these are trivially complemented by the zero - intensity state that is stable below threshold , @xmath70 , and unstable above . in the cubic case",
    "the stationary intensity above threshold asymptotes to the value @xmath71 for large pump intensities and is always stable .",
    "the steady - state curve for the sinc@xmath0 model , on the other hand , becomes multivalued at large values of the input pump intensity ( @xmath72 , not shown here ) @xcite . here , however , we are interested in values of the pump intensity below @xmath73 , as these are more realistic with respect to present state - of - the - art of broad area sropo realisations . in this regime",
    "it is possible to prove that , above threshold , the non - zero steady - state intensities in the sinc@xmath0 model are also stable @xcite .",
    "note that when comparing the sinc@xmath0 and the cubic models , there is a substantial difference between their steady - state intensities even below @xmath74 .",
    "at twice above threshold this difference becomes considerable and the close to threshold ( cubic ) model has to be discarded .",
    "analogously to lasers , the field phase is decoupled from the steady - state equations and is affected by fluctuations and drift processes . when there is external seeding , @xmath75 , the phase of the sropo locks to that of the external beam , depending on the magnitude of the detuning @xmath50 and the input intensity .",
    "such behavior strongly differs from that of @xmath49 . in the case of @xmath76",

    "the steady - state curves of the sropo intensity versus the input intensity become s - shaped , a behavior typical of injected optical systems , as shown in section [ tupf ] .",
    "for the cubic model without diffraction it is possible to obtain analytical results .",
    "for example , for @xmath79 the plane - wave steady - state curves are s - shaped , and the positions of the turning points @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] can be determined by finding the maxima and minima of ( [ sswseed ] ) : @xmath82 \\ , .\\ ] ] and then using these values in ( [ sswseed ] ) . at resonance , @xmath83 ,",

    "the linear stability analysis of the steady - states given in the previous section produces two stability eigenvalues : @xmath86 where for the sinc@xmath0 model @xmath87 and for the cubic model @xmath88 for the sinc@xmath0 model , the stability eigenvalues are implicit functions of the steady - state intensity , @xmath68 .",
    "it is , however , easy to display the stability of the stationary states graphically along the s - shaped curves by picking increasing values of @xmath68 , evaluating @xmath89 and reporting the stability result on the diagram , as displayed in figures [ fig : pfe02_2 ] and [ fig : pfe02_8 ] . here",

    "the larger the detuning , @xmath50 , between the external laser and the sropo cavity , the larger the seed intensity necessary for locking .",
    "since the lower branch of the s - shaped steady - state curves is always hopf unstable for small seeding , one expects to observe dynamical regimes where locking and unlocking alternate in space and time . in comparison with purely temporal systems ,",
    "the presence of transverse degrees of freedom elongates the locking region to lower values of the seeding intensity , as displayed in figures [ fig : pfe02_2 ] and [ fig : pfe02_8 ] where stable hexagons are observed well into the region where plane wave solutions are unstable . as the seeding intensity is decreased , unlocking eventually takes place and stable patterns develop defects @xcite that induce first phase and then amplitude instabilities .",

    "fitting exponentials to the correlation functions shows that in the turbulent regimes the correlation length is reduced by at least a factor of six .    in the regime of optical turbulence , large variations of the sropo intensity",
    "are observed in both space and time . in figures [ fig : pfe02_2 ] and [ fig : pfe02_8 ] we display the range of variation of the sropo intensity at a given time @xmath138 at the onset of optical turbulence . the wide increase in the maximum sropo intensity",
    "when changing the seed strength below the hexagon instability is clearly visible .    to characterize the regime of optical turbulence we have considered the temporal evolutions of the maximum sropo intensity , the spatial average of the sropo intensity and its standard deviation . as displayed in figure [ fig : turb2and8 ] , the spatial statistics is large enough to guarantee probability distributions of well defined averages and deviations .",
    "larger values of the pump power increase the size of the probability distribution of the sropo intensity and that of the fluctuations of its maximum value ( compare figures [ fig : turb2and8](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "such increase results in the occurrence and propagation of transverse rogue waves .    following the generally accepted definition of rogue waves in systems with injection @xcite , we plot the temporal evolution of @xmath139 corresponding to transverse pulse maxima , @xmath140 , above or below a threshold given by the average value of the intensity , @xmath141 , plus eight times the standard deviation , @xmath142 , of the sropo intensity for the sinc@xmath0 model in the dashed - dotted red lines of figures [ fig : turb2and8](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the presence of peaks of a rogue wave is signalled by positive values of @xmath143 @xcite . with pump intensities a few times above threshold ( figure [ fig : turb2and8](a ) ) ,",
    "the rogue wave test fails ( @xmath143 remains negative ) and the optical turbulence generated by the unlocking of the seed laser and the sropo is relatively mild . with larger values of the pump power",
    ", however , rogue waves are commonplace and affect the spatio - temporal evolution of the sropo field for long durations of the temporal evolution ( see figure [ fig : turb2and8](b ) ) .",
    "when comparing these results with those related to lasers with injections @xcite , we note that our simulations are fully spatio - temporal and show that the material dynamics , typical of semiconductor media , is not essential in the generation and maintenance of rogue waves during optical turbulence .",
    "the main mechanism underlying rogue waves in sropos is the absence of locking between master and slave devices leading to intermittent phase jumps .",
    "full investigations of optical turbulence in injected ( seeded ) optical devices will be presented elsewhere .    finally , we have studied the presence and stability of cavity solitons ( cs ) in sropos with a particular focus on localised structures induced by the sinc@xmath0 nonlinearity , i.e. away from threshold and with large seeding from an external laser .",
    "cs have been described in a variety of opo devices without seeding from degenerate @xcite to non - degenerate triply resonant configurations @xcite .",
    "cs in degenerate opos have also been numerically extended to include the presence of seeding @xcite . in the case of the non - degenerate sropos investigated here , the resonance condition of sropo operation rules out any cs in the absence of seeding .",
    "it is then important to stress that all cs solutions described in this section are due to the external seeding field and have no counterpart in the case of @xmath49 .",
    "since we have introduced the sinc@xmath0 nonlinearity in spatio - temporal models of sropos to describe self - organization when pump depletion and back  conversion take place , we focus here on cs in the limit of large pump powers . from figures [ fig : pfe02_8 ] and [ fig :",
    "instabregime ] we see that there are broad ranges of the parameter space where bistability between the plane wave solution and pattern structures is observed .",
    "for example , we find coexistent hexagons and homogeneous solutions for @xmath144 between 19.98 and 21.90 and coexistent honeycombs and homogeneous solutions for @xmath144 between 26.00 and 28.09 .",
    "note that we even observe tri - stability among plane waves , hexagons and rolls for @xmath144 between 21.25 and 21.90 and among plane waves , honeycombs and rolls for @xmath144 between 26.00 and 26.52 .",
    "in the two wide regions of homogeneous - pattern bistability we have been able to locate single peak ( bright ) and single trough ( dark ) cs as shown for example in figure [ fig : cs ] ( a ) and ( d ) , respectively . the onset and nature of these cs",
    "are again similar to those observed in nascent optical bistability @xcite .",
    "together with the single unit bright and dark cs we have also found many multi - peak @xcite and multi - trough localized structures that correspond to clusters of cs ( also referred to as localized patterns @xcite ) .",
    "a few examples of these bright and dark clusters are displayed in figure [ fig : cs ] .",
    "the range of existence of single unit cs and cs clusters is displayed in figure [ fig : csrange ] .",
    "snaking of both bright and dark cs is observed with stability branches of larger and larger clusters approaching the pattern stability lines in the parameter space ( see figure [ fig : csrange ] ) .",
    "the details of the bifurcations and of the number of branches of bright and dark cs for changing @xmath52 are too long to be described here and will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "( color online ) stable bright ( a)-(c ) and dark ( d)-(f ) cs configurations of the sropo model ( [ sropo ] ) .",
    "parameters are @xmath115 , @xmath109 , @xmath145 for ( a)-(c ) , @xmath146 for ( d ) and @xmath147 for ( e)-(f ) .",
    "all variables are dimensionless . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "self - organization and pattern formation in opos has been known for a number of years in degenerate @xcite or doubly or triply resonant non - degenerate configurations @xcite .",
    "the case of a widely non - degenerate sropo has , however , been overlooked because of experimental limitations , now overcome , and the fact that off - resonance operation is inhibited because of its intrinsic tuneability .",
    "here we have shown that under the action of a detuned injection close to the signal frequency , one can find an extremely rich variety of self - organized structures , from regular co - existing patterns to clusters of cs and even optical turbulence .",
    "in particular , we have derived mean field models for sropos with external seeding and shown that , away from threshold , cubic nonlinearities should be replaced by sinc@xmath0 terms .",
    "the sinc@xmath0 nonlinearity is capable of describing regimes of pump depletion and back - conversion . in these regimes",
    ", the external seeding generates hexagonal , roll and honeycomb patterns as well as bright and dark cs .",
    "note that cs in sropos offer positional control associated to the generation of entangled photons with vastly different frequencies .",
    "in contrast to laser systems , the fast material dynamics of @xmath1 media makes a sropo with external seeding an ideal candidate for comparisons between theory and experiments of optical self - organization .",
    "the fast material dynamics is also beneficial to the investigation of spatio - temporal structures in the regime of short pulse generation where many of the results presented here can find useful extensions . these investigations together with the full characterization of the turbulent regimes",
