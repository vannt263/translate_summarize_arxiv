    "the continuous progress in manipulating single molecules chemically bound to macroscopic reservoirs has led to the emerging field of molecular electronics.@xcite besides the widely studied stationary case , today experimental techniques enable the study of time - dependent phenomena in open quantum systems , like photon - assisted transport and electron pumping through realistic or artificial molecules .    an electron pump is an electronic device generating a net current between two unbiased electrodes .",
    "pumping is achieved by applying a periodic gate voltage depending on two or more parameters .",
    "electron pumps have been realized experimentally , e.g. , for an open semiconductor quantum dot@xcite driven by two harmonic gate voltages with a phase shift , and for a open nanotube@xcite driven by an electrostatic potential wave .    in the literature",

    "the generalization to arbitrary periodic potentials has been put forward by zhou et al.@xcite who used the keldysh technique to calculate the net charge transported across the device per period .    a natural way to go beyond the adiabatic case",

    "alternatively , one can combine floquet theory with non - equilibrium green s function techniques.@xcite generally speaking , floquet - based approaches provide a very powerful tool to calculate average quantities of periodically driven systems .",
    "however , going beyond the monochromatic case quite quickly becomes computationally demanding .",
    "furthermore , such approaches are not applicable to the study of transient effects and non - periodic phenomena .    in this work",
    "we propose a time - dependent approach suited to study the effects of an electric field , like a gate voltage or a laser field , on the electron dynamics of a nanoscale junction .",
    "our approach allows for calculating the full time dependence ( including the transient behavior ) of observables like the local density or current , and the same computational effort is required for both monochromatic and polychromatic drivings as well as for nonperiodic perturbations .",
