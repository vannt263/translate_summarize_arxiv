    "reduced transition probabilities , the b(e2 ) values for transitions from the first excited @xmath1 to the ground states in even - even nuclei are fundamentally important quantities in nuclear physics for determining the collectivity in nuclei . as such , experimental efforts to measure b(e2 ) values have been going on for the past sixty years and many different techniques",
    "have been developed for this purpose .",
    "the two most common methods are coulomb excitation ( ce ) and doppler - shift attenuation ( dsam ) . a recent ce study of the b(e2 ) values for sn nuclei @xcite compared their measurements with previous works and revealed an apparent systematic disagreement with a set of dsam measurements @xcite . without doubting the standard formulations relating b(e2 ) and lifetime , this does raise the question that , given the different sets of systematic errors associated with different techniques , are the results significantly impacted such that the methods may or may not be considered equivalent . to the best of our knowledge , this question has never been addressed comprehensively across the entire chart of nuclides while comparing different methods , although , limited comparisons have been published between ce experiments at different energies @xcite .    our newly published compilation and evaluation of experimental b(e2 ) values @xcite for the first @xmath1 states in the even - even nuclei , an extensive update of the previous work by raman et al .",
    "@xcite , provides an opportunity to adequately answer the question of whether systematic differences exist between different methods of determining b(e2 ) values .",
    "in particular , we focus here on the most common experimental techniques for measuring b(e2 ) values , namely : doppler - shift attenuation method ( dsam ) , recoil distance doppler - shift ( rdds ) , delayed coincidences ( dc ) , coulomb excitation ( ce ) , nuclear resonance fluorescence ( nrf ) and the weakly model dependent method of electron scattering ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "note that dsam includes also `` transmission '' doppler - shift attenuation in which particles are still travelling through the medium when gamma - rays are detected . in making comparisons between methods , using our compiled data ,",
    "we have selected only those nuclei which have had their b(e2 ) values measured by at least two different methods , with each method being independently employed by different laboratories at least twice .",
    "this requirement implies that we can always take an average when determining the result from a particular method , reducing the likelihood of an outlying measurement having a large influence on our conclusions . as a result , of the 447 nuclei",
    "which were included in our compilation , we can only use measurements on 100 of those nuclei .",
    "table  [ tab : be2data ] lists these nuclei and their b(e2 ) values as determined by the different experimental methods .",
    "our statistical analysis is performed as follows : let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two measurements of the b(e2 ) value of the same nucleus determined by different methods . note that since we insist that each experimental method be performed at least twice on each isotope , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are each an average of at least two independent measurements .",
    "we define the normalized difference between the two results , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as @xmath7 assume that @xmath5 was sampled from a random variable , @xmath8 , which is normally distributed such that @xmath9 is the `` true value '' of the b(e2 ) value for the nucleus and @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , assume @xmath6 was sampled from a normally distributed random variable , @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 .",
    "the two experimental procedures will be equivalent for this nucleus if @xmath13 . under these assumptions",
    ", @xmath14 will be sampled from a normal distribution with mean given by @xmath15 and unit variance .",
    "clearly , if the two experimental methods are equivalent , then @xmath16 , independent of which nucleus is being considered . also notice that since @xmath14 is dimensionless and @xmath17 , we can interpret @xmath14 as being the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in units of standard deviations of @xmath18 .",
    "now consider two sets of b(e2 ) measurements , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "each @xmath21 is determined by one experimental method , while each @xmath22 is determined by another .",
    "the two sets are paired such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are measurements on the same nucleus and hence for each such pair we can calculate @xmath23 according to equation  ( [ eq : normdiff ] ) . under the hypothesis that the two methods are equivalent , @xmath24 is a sample of size @xmath25 from a standard normal distribution ( i.e. one with zero mean and unit variance ) .",
    "however , as we shall show later , the actual distribution of @xmath24 we observe has some degree of asymmetry .",
    "this could arise due to underestimated uncertainties since that would artificially increase the resulting values of @xmath14 .",
    "we circumvent this problem phenomenologically by postulating ( and later provide evidence using the real data ) that the distribution of @xmath24 is in fact an asymmetric normal distribution , with probability density function given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mode ( most probable value ) of the distribution , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 give the upper and lower standard deviations , respectively . by fitting the values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 to the distribution of @xmath24",
    ", we can compute the probability that methods @xmath5 and @xmath6 will differ by @xmath30 standard deviations as ( recall the interpretation of @xmath14 above ) @xmath31 the average difference as @xmath32 and the most probable deviation is simply @xmath27 .",
    "each of these quantities provides a different measure of difference between methods @xmath5 and @xmath6 . using these measures we define three different criteria for determining that two methods are not equivalent :    a.   @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. it is more probable that @xmath34 differs from zero by at least one standard deviation than not ; b.   @xmath35 , i.e. on average @xmath34 differs from zero by at least one standard deviation ; c.   @xmath36 , i.e. the most probable value of @xmath34 differs from zero by more than one standard deviation .",
    "criteria ( ii ) and ( iii ) also give information regarding the direction of the deviation , e.g. if @xmath37 then not only can we say that @xmath5 is not equivalent to @xmath6 , but that it is on average less than @xmath6 .",
    "let us consider a particular example to illustrate this analysis in detail .",
    "the two most common methods for determining b(e2 ) values are ce and dsam , so let us compare those methods ( i.e. choose @xmath38 ce and @xmath39 dsam ) .",
    "there are 43 nuclei which have at least two independent dsam and two independent ce measurements .",
    "we can compute the normalized differences between the two methods , @xmath23 , as defined above for these 43 cases . to show that these data are not normally distributed",
    ", we performed a shapiro - wilk test @xcite .",
    "this test uses a statistic denoted @xmath40 which is close to unity for normally distributed data and close to zero otherwise . for this dataset",
    ", we found that @xmath41 , which gives a p - value of @xmath42 , i.e. the probability of obtaining that value of @xmath40 , assuming that the data are normally distributed , is less than 1% .",
    "therefore , it is statistically significant that @xmath43 are not normally distributed .",
    "instead we can fit an asymmetric normal distribution to @xmath43 and obtain @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 . using pearson s @xmath47 test for goodness of fit , @xmath48 , which is smaller than the critical @xmath47 for rejection at 99% confidence level , indicating an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "hence we have shown , as claimed above , that @xmath23 is not normally distributed , but is well - modelled as being distributed according to an asymmetric normal distribution .",
    "a histogram of @xmath49 together with the asymmetric normal fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cedsa ] . using this fit",
    "we can calculate the various quantities defined above to test for equivalence between ce and dsam : @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we would conclude that dsam and ce are equivalent methods using criteria ( ii ) and ( iii ) , however they are not equivalent by criterion ( i ) .",
    "this discrepancy is further discussed in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "[ fig : cedsa ] could be misleading in the sense that the remaining distribution , after removing the outlying point , appears symmetric and so one might concluded that using an asymmetric distribution in this analysis is not actually necessary . to clarify this point , fig .  [",
    "fig : ceee ] shows a histogram of the @xmath14 values for the ce/(@xmath2 ) pair . in this case",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , hence the two methods are equivalent according to all three criteria . however , we see that the distribution is still quite asymmetric .",
    "the histograms of @xmath14 values for ce with the remaining methods ( dc , rdds , nrf ) are given in [ app : hist ] also show asymmetric distributions .",

    "[ fig : diffs],title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to systematically establish the equivalence of each method to one another , we performed this analysis for each pair of methods and did not find any pairs which satisfied criteria ( ii ) or ( iii ) , although a dsam / ce and dsam / nrf did satisfy ( i ) .",
    "however , in both of these cases neither of the other two criteria are also satisfied .",
    "this gives some evidence that there may be problems with some of dsam measurements , but not necessarily anything systematically wrong with the method itself .",
    "indeed , if the dsam measurements for @xmath0ni are excluded then the discrepancy with ce and nrf no longer exists .",
    "this is discussed in detail in section [ sec : dis ] . in this global comparison",
    ", we also do not have any evidence for a systematic deviation of b(e2 ) values in sn nuclides as suggested in the recent study @xcite .",
