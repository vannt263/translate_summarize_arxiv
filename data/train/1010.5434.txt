    "the w40 @xcite complex is a star - formation region in the constellation serpens .",
    "the complex is made up of the molecular cloud g28.8 + 3.5 @xcite with a diameter of @xmath3 , the dense molecular core doh 279-p7 @xcite with a diameter of @xmath4 , an ob star cluster , and an h ii blister region .",
    "the complex is behind a screen of @xmath5  mag of extinction , so only a handful of stars can be seen in the optical band ( figure [ fig_dss]b ) . because of the high absorption , the stellar cluster has been little studied .",
    "the cluster is relatively nearby , but the distance has not been sufficiently constrained and estimates vary from 300  pc to 900  pc .",
    "previous observations show that w40 is partially embedded in its natal molecular cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicates that the cluster is no more than a few million years old .",
    "infrared ( ir ) has been the primary wavelength for studies of star formation . however , certain abilities of x - ray studies make observations particularly useful for examining young stellar clusters ( yscs ) .",

    "another advantage of studies in the x - ray is that bright nebulosity , which may be a source of confusion in the ir or optical , is avoided at x - ray wavelengths , yielding greater source detection sensitivity .",
    "differences between x - ray brightness of t - tauri and ob stars are not so dramatic as in optical and in ir bands , so x - rays often allow detection of low mass pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars close to ob stars .",
    "x - ray observations also preferentially detect pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars without disks ( class iii ) , unlike the ir , where stars possessing circumstellar disks ( class ii or i/0 ) are preferentially detected due to ir excesses .",
    "thus , x - ray observations reduce biases present in ir surveys of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , and x - ray and ir surveys are complementary to each other .",
    "the ability to observe stars with large optical extinctions is essential in any study of w40 due to the large amount of obscuring material along the line of sight .",
    "the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ is also necessary to observe stars in the center of the cluster .",

    "the dust lane passes through the eastern half of the cluster core , and lies several arcminutes to the east of the co core .",
    "the filament has dimensions 3@xmath25 by 12@xmath25 , and an approximate angular area of 36 arcmin@xmath147 or 1.1@xmath148 cm@xmath147 at a distance of 600  pc .",
    "the filament s mass is estimated by multiplying its angular area by the difference in mean column density inside and outside the lane giving a total mass of @xmath10200  m@xmath0 .",
    "this is comparable to the mass of the molecular core found by @xcite .",
    "if we assume the filament s extent along the line of sight is similar to its width of 3  arcmin , then the hydrogen density of the filament is @xmath150  atoms @xmath151 .",
    "if the distance of 260  pc were considered instead , the masses of both the molecular core and dust lane would be scaled down by a factor of @xmath105 , but the density would be the same .",
    "the presence of a large number of sources with @xmath1 excess near the dust lane , suggests that the lane may be a region of active star formation .",
    "this is further supported by the high concentration of _ herschel _ protostar candidates from figure 3 of @xcite that lie in this region .",
    "in contrast , few deeply embedded x - ray sources are found in the co core , suggesting that the molecular core is not the location of present star formation .",
    "the geometry of the dust lane and the molecular core suggests that they form a ring , similar to the rings described by @xcite .",
    "however , ysos projected on the molecular core do not have very high @xmath62 , and co is not detected strongly in the dust lane .",
    "the former problem may be explained if the ring is oriented from our point of view so that the dust lane passes in front of the cluster and the molecular core is behind the cluster .",
    "the molecular core probably has a normal gas - to - dust ratio and we would see both co emission and a visual dust lane if we were observing the cluster along a line of sight that passes through the cloud .    the lack of co detection in the dust lane might mean that the molecular material has been destroyed in this region , or it might be an effect of the lack of sensitivity of the co observations .",

    "it is possible that the formation of a radiative core in the latter case is associated with the change in the magnetic field dynamo , for example from turbulent to alpha - omega , which in turn strengthens their magnetic fields and allows production of super - hot flares .",

    "the xlf gives a lower limit distance to w40 of 600  pc (  [ section_distance ] ) .",
    "the xlf analysis shows that the total cluster population of pms stars is @xmath182600 pms stars assuming a distance of 600  pc , and a @xmath1-band excess disk fraction of 50% suggests a cluster age @xmath1871  myr (  [ tot_pop_section ] ) .",

    "the x - ray observation is not sensitive to a protostellar population that might exist in w40 @xcite ; only two protostellar x - ray candidates are identified (  [ identifications_section ] ) .",
    "the young age of the w40 cluster , inferred from the high disk fraction and the existence of gas in the cluster , and the ongoing star formation in the dust lane (  [ section_highav ] ) indicate that the cluster should not be dynamically relaxed yet (  [ section_general_spatial ] ) .",
    "however , the cluster does show some signs of relaxation , including a nearly spherical morphology with no elongation (  [ section_elongation ] ) , a surface density profile that may be described by an isothermal sphere (  [ radial_profile ] ) , and mass segregation (  [ section_mass_segregation ] ) . the cluster shape and profile may indicate the beginning of relaxation , but may also be geometric projection effects .",
    "mass segregation down to 1.5  m@xmath0 in w40 (  [ section_mass_segregation ] ) is unusual , but it is predicted in simulation studies of yscs by @xcite .",
    "the w40 star cluster may be composed of populations with different ages (  [ section_ksdistribution ] ) .",
    "many of the stars without @xmath1-band excess may belong to an older population which has progressed further toward gravitational relaxation , while many of the stars with @xmath1-band excess , which are almost all located on the eastern side of the cluster , may be younger and may have not had time to mix with the rest of the cluster .",
    "it is likely that most of the high mass stars , 6 out of 8 having @xmath1-band excess , are members of the second population , suggesting delayed massive star formation (  [ tot_pop_section ] ) .",
    "the dust lane , which passes through the core and is detected by x - ray , optical , and ir absorption , may be the site of ongoing star formation (  [ section_highav ] ) .",
    "in contrast , no evidence is found for star formation in the molecular core detected in @xmath16co and @xmath17co .",
    "the dust lane and molecular core have similar masses and may both be part of a ring of interstellar material surrounding the star cluster . however , the dust lane is undetected in co , and might be an example of the destruction of molecular gas by stars or molecular gas freezing out on to dust grains .    diffuse x - ray emission is detected in w40 (  [ diffuse_section ] ) .",

    "a minority of studies consider w40 to be part of the aquila rift at a distance of 260  pc , rather than the more commonly adopted distance of 600  pc (  [ past_section ] ) .",
    "the lower distance would modify results in the following ways : the shape of the w40 xlf would be inconsistent with the coup xlf ; for w40 stars without @xmath1-excess the shape of the imf would be inconsistent with the @xcite or coup imfs ; the lower limit on the total cluster population would be 200 stars ; only 2 stars would have masses above 10  m@xmath0 ; and mass segregation would be seen down to 0.3  m@xmath0 .",
