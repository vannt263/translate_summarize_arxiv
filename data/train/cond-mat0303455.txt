    "higher developed organisms face the problem to store and retrieve a huge amount of genetic information  and this in each cell separately . for instance",
    ", the human genom corresponds to 3 billion base pairs ( bp ) of the dna double helix , two copies of which make up two meters of dna chains that have to be stored within the tiny micron - sized nucleus of each cell @xcite .",
    "these two meters are composed of 46 shorter dna pieces , each of which , if not condensed , would form a swollen coil of roughly 100@xmath0 diameter  clearly much too large to fit into the nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "the densely packed genom would form a ball of just @xmath1 @xmath2 diameter due to the huge aspect ratio of contour length  2 meters  versus diameter  20    of the dna material .",
    "hence , the dna indeed fits into the nucleus but a suitable compaction mechanism is required .",
    "dna is a highly charged macromolecule carrying two negative elementary charges per 3.4  . in the presence of multivalent counterions dna",
    "condenses into dense",
    " often toroidal  aggregates  @xcite , resembling the dna packaged in virial capsids @xcite . in viruses",
    "the dna has just to be stored whereas such a simple way of dna compaction can not work for the long dna chains in eucaryotic cells ( cells of fungi , plants and animals ) where many portions of the dna have to be accessible to a large number of proteins ( gene regulatory proteins , transcription factors , rna polymerases etc . ) .",
    "therefore the substrate that these proteins interact with must be much more versatile to allow access to certain regions of the dna and to hide ( i.e. to silence ) other parts .",
    "that way each cell can regulate the expression of its genes separately according to its state in the cell cycle , the amount of nutrients present etc .",
    "furthermore , the differentiation of cells into the various types that make up a multicellular organism relies to a large extent on the way the dna  which is identical in all the cells  is packaged .",
    "the substrate that combines all these features is chromatin , a complex of dna and so - called _",
    "histone proteins_. in 1974 it has been realized that the fundamental unit of chromatin is the _ nucleosome _",
    "@xcite : roughly 200 bp of dna are associated with one globular octameric aggregate of eight histone proteins consisting of two molecules each of the four core histones h2a , h2b , h3 and h4 .",
    "a stretch of 147 bp dna is wrapped in a @xmath3-@xmath4and-@xmath5 left - handed superhelical turn around the octamer and is connected via a stretch of linker dna to the next such protein spool .",
    "each octamer together with the wrapped dna forms a _",
    "nucleosome core particle _ with a radius of @xmath6 nm and a height of @xmath7 nm which carries a large negative electric charge @xcite .    while the structure of individual core particles is now documented in great detail mainly on the basis of high - resolution x - ray analyses @xcite , much less",
    "is known about the higher - order structures to which they give rise . when the fiber is swollen  as this is the case for low ionic strength ",
    "it has the appearance of  beads - on - a - string . ",
    "it is sometimes referred to as the  10-nm fiber  since its  beads   have @xmath8 nm diameter @xcite . with increasing salt concentration , heading towards physiological conditions ( roughly 100 mm ) ,",
    "the fiber becomes denser and thicker , attaining a diameter of @xmath9 nm @xcite .",
    "longstanding controversy surrounds the structure of this so - called 30_-nm fiber _",
    "in the _ solenoid models _ @xcite  it is assumed that the chain of nucleosomes forms a helical structure with the linker dna bent in between whereas the _ zig - zag _ or _ crossed linker models _",
    "@xcitepostulate straight linkers that connect nucleosomes that are located on opposite sites of the fiber .",
    "the higher - order folding of the 30-nm fiber into structures on scales up to microns is yet to be elucidated . in fig .  1 i sketch the steps of the dna folding starting with a dna chain of length @xmath10 cm and @xmath11 octamers and ending up at",
    "the highly condensed _",
    "chromosome_. this highly condensed structure occurs before cell division and contains the chain and its copy neatly packaged for the distribution into the two daughter cells .",
    "the size of the chromosome is @xmath12 times smaller than the contour length of the original chain .",
    "cm is compacted with the help of @xmath13 histone octamers leading to 10000-fold reduction of its original length ( see text for details),width=453 ]    it is instructive to draw a comparison between the structure and function of chromatin to that of a daily - life example : the library .",
    "as the nucleus stores the long one - dimensional string of basepairs , so does the library contain the huge one - dimensional string of letters , the text written down in all of its books . a book like ref",
    "@xcite contains @xmath8 km text , a library with 10000 books stores roughly 100000 km text !",
    "how can the user find and retrieve the little piece of information of interest ?",
    "the way this is handled is that the text is folded in a hierarchical fashion in lines , pages , books and shelves .",
    "this makes it is relatively easy  with the help of a few markers  to find the corresponding text passage .",
    "furthermore , all the text is stored in a dense fashion but the book of interest can be taken out of the shelve and opened at the appropriate page without perturbing the rest of the library .",
    "apparently , the result of this hierarchical structure is a relative high efficiency in storing a huge amount of information in a relatively small space and , at the same time , having a high accessibility to it .",
    "the similarities between hierarchies in the library and in chromatin are pretty obvious .",
    "what is less obvious and in many respects still an open question is how the dense chromatin structure can be opened locally to allow access to its genes .",
    "as mentioned above for one nucleosomal repeat length , typically 200 bp , 147 bp are wrapped around the octamer , i.e. , roughly 75 percent of the dna chain is tightly associated to the histone aggregates .",
    "it is known that many essential proteins that interact with dna do not have access to dna when it is wrapped ( reviewed in ref .",
    "moreover , even the unwrapped sections  the linker dna  are somewhat buried inside the dense 30-nm fiber .",
    "therefore , it is necessary for the cell to have mechanisms at hand to open  unfold  the fiber and then , somehow , to unwrap the dna from the protein spools or to temporarily remove them from the dna piece of interest .",
    "this leads to the problem of how the chromatin structure changes its shape with time . as this structure involves length scales of many orders in magnitude ( from ngstroms to microns )",
    "so do its dynamical processes take place in a wide range of time scales , beginning with fluctuations of the nucleosome structure in the micro- to millisecond timescale @xcite up to large scale variations in the condensation degree of the chromosome that follows the cell cycle with a typical period of hours to days @xcite .",
    "it has been shown through competitive protein binding to nucleosomal dna @xcite  that thermal fluctuations might lead to partial unwrapping of the dna from the nucleosome .",
    "this mechanism provides intermittent access to nucleosomal dna .",
    "not only unwrapping but even ",
    "_ sliding _  of nucleosomes along dna seems to be facilitated by thermal fluctuations as it has been demonstrated in well - defined _ in vitro _",
    "experiments @xcite .",
    "whereas this kind of repositioning dynamics is quite slow  even at elevated temperatures the timescale is of the order of minutes to hours  nucleosome repositioning appears also to be of great importance _ in vivo _ where it is aided by _ chromatin - remodeling complexes _ , large multi - protein complexes that use energy by burning atp ( reviewed in refs .",
    "kornberg99,varga - weisz98,guschin99,peterson00,flaus01 ) .",
    "these complexes might catalyze and direct the displacement of nucleosomes out of regions where direct access to dna has to be granted ( like promoter regions of transcriptionally active genes ) .    based on a range of experiments",
    "it has also been speculated that rna polymerase , the protein complex that transcribes  copies  genes , can itself act  through  nucleosomes without having to disrupt the structure completely studitsky94,studitsky95,felsenfeld96,studitsky97,felsenfeld00 .",
    "an appealing picture is the idea that the polymerase gets around the nucleosome in a loop .",
    "such a mechanism is especially important since genes are typically distributed over a dna portion of the length of 100 s to 10000 s of bp which means that there are a few up to 1000 s of nucleosomes with which a polymerase has somehow to deal with during transcription .    concerning the unfolding of the 30-nm fiber , i mentioned already above that a decrease in the ionic strength leads to a swelling of the fiber . obviously , _ in vivo",
    "such a global swelling is not possible within the tiny space available within the nucleus .",
    "hence only the unfolding of local regions should be expected as the above given analogy of a library suggests .",
    "experimental observations seem to indicate that the swelling degree can indeed be tuned locally by the acetylation of the lysine - rich ( i.e. cationic ) _ tails _ of the eight core histones that appear to be long flexible polyelectrolyte chains @xcite that extend out of the globular part .",
    "furthermore , transcriptionally active chromatin portions show a depletion in the _ linker histone _ h1 , a cationic proteins that is believed to act close to the entry - exit region of the dna at the nucleosome .",
    "as long as h1 is present the fiber is relatively dense and the individual nucleosomes are inert against thermal fluctuations ( no unwrapping , sliding or transcription through the octamer ) . if h1 is missing the chromatin fiber appears to be much more open and the nucleosomes become  transparent  and mobile due to thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "undoubtedly chromatin lies in the heart of many essential biological processes ranging from gene expression to cell division .",
    "most of these processes are controlled by a huge amount of specific proteins .",
    "their investigation clearly belongs to the realm of biologists and is beyond the scope of a physicist .",
    "nevertheless , many insights gained in this field were achieved through _ in vitro _",
    "experiments under relative well - controlled conditions , in some cases essentially only involving dna and histone proteins .",
    "furthermore , new physical methods like micromanipulation experiments allowed to gain access to certain physical properties of chromatin .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss some of these results and , especially , to review the physical theories they gave rise to .",
    "the interest of physicists into single nucleosomes was mainly sparked by the above mentioned fact that the core particle carries a large negative net charge .",
    "this is due to the fact that much more negatively charged dna is wrapped around the cationic octamer than necessary for its neutralization .",
    "beginning around 1998 a considerable activity started among several research groups to explain on which physical facts _ overcharging _ is based ( recently reviewed in @xcite ) , a phenomenon not only occurring in chromatin but also in dna - lipid complexes , multilayer adsorption of polyelectrolytes etc . to gain insight into this",
    "the nucleosome was translated into different types of toy models , usually consisting of one charged chain and an oppositely charged sphere and the amount of wrapping was calculated park99,mateescu99,gurovitch99,netz99,kunze00,nguyen01,nguyen01b , nguyen01c , schiessel01,nguyen01d , gelbart01,kunze02,schiessel02b ( cf . also the related studies odijk80,pincus84,vongoeler94,wallin96,wallin96b , wallin97,wallin98,haronska98,jonsson01,chodanowski01,sakaue01,messina02,messina02b , jonsson02,akinchina02,dzubiella02 ) .",
    "it turned out that overcharging is a fairly robust phenomenon that occurs even if certain mechanisms are neglected ( like counterion release upon adsorption ) .",
    "it was also shown that multi - sphere - complexation can lead to _ undercharged _ systems @xcite .",
    "the relevance of these toy models for  real  nucleosomes might be questionable , especially since the binding sites of the dna to the octamer are relatively specific @xcite and since under physiological conditions ( 100 mm ) the screening length is fairly short  10 nm , i.e. , half the diameter of the dna double helix .",
    "nevertheless , these models might give some insight into the unwrapping transition that takes place when the dna which is fairly rigid on the nucleosome length scale unwraps from the nucleosome due to a decrease of the adsorption energy .",
    "this can be achieved by a change in the salt concentration and has indeed been observed experimentally @xcite . a simple approach to this problem comparing adsorption energies between a  sticky  spool and a semiflexible chain and its bending energy has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite and led to the prediction of an _ unwrapping transition _ in an all - or - nothing fashion , i.e. , the cylinder is fully wrapped by the chain or not wrapped at all .",
    "a more complex picture has been found in refs .",
    "netz99,kunze00 where the unwrapping has been calculated for complexes with short chains (  nucleosome core particles  ) .",
    "here the chain showed different degrees of wrapping ( dependent on the ionic strength ) which seems to agree fairly well with the corresponding experimental observations on core particles @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that besides the wrapped and unwrapped structures there is for longer chains the realm of open _ multi - loop _ complexes ( so - called _ rosettes _ ) that have now also been observed in computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the nucleosome repositioning , mentioned above , is another single - nucleosome problem that has been investigated theoretically schiessel01c , kulic02,kulic02b .",
    "it is suggested that the nucleosome  sliding  is based on the formation of loops at the ends of the nucleosome which then diffuse as defects around the spool , leading to the repositioning .",
    "this process somewhat resembles polymer reptation in the confining tube of the surrounding medium ( a polymer network or melt ) , cf .",
    "@xcite . a different  channel  for",
    "repositioning might be a cork screw motion of the dna helix around the octamer induced by twist defects which has now also been studied theoretically @xcite",
    ".    on the level of the 30-nm fiber recent progress has been made in the visualization of these fibers via electron cyromicroscopy @xcite .",
    "the micrographs reveal for lower ionic strength structures that resemble the crossed linker model mentioned above .",
    "however , for increasing ionic strength the fibers become so dense that their structure still remains obscure .",
    "an alternative approach was achieved via the micromanipulation of single 30-nm fibers @xcite .",
    "the stretching of the fibers showed interesting mechanical properties , namely a very low stretching modulus for small tension , a force plateau around 5 pn and , at much higher tensions , saw - tooth - type patterns .",
    "these experimental results led to a revival of interest in 30-nm fiber models .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite as well as computer simulations @xcite attempted to explain the mechanical properties of the fiber . what all these models have in common is that they assume straight linkers in accordance with the experimental observations , at least found for lower ionic strength @xcite .",
    "the low stretching modulus of the fibers is then attributed to the bending and twisting of the linker dna which is induced by the externally applied tension . indeed",
    ", all the models find a relatively good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the @xmath14 force plateau is usually interpreted as a reversible condensation - decondensation transition of the fiber which can be attributed to a small attractive interaction between the nucleosomes schiessel01b , katritch00 .",
    "this is also in good agreement with recent studies on single nucleosome core particles where such a weak attraction has been observed and attributed to a tail - bridging effect mangenot02,mangenot02b . finally , the sawtooth - pattern which leads to a non - reversible lenghtening of the fiber probably reflects the  evaporation  of histones from the dna @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the crossed - linker models suggest that the density of nucleosomes in the fiber depends to a large extend on the entry - exit angle of the dna at the nucleosomes .",
    "it is known that in the presence of the linker histone the entering and exiting strands are forced together in a ",
    "region @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite investigated how the electrostatic repulsion between the two strands dictates this entry - exit angle .",
    "especially , it was shown how this angle can be controlled _ in vitro _ via a change in the salt concentration .",
    "it also has been speculated that via biochemical mechanisms that control the charges in the entry - exit region ( like the acetylation of certain histone tails ) the cell can locally induce a swelling of the fiber @xcite .    before discussing in the following all the above mentioned issues concerning the physics of chromatin",
    ", i note that there are also important studies using a bottom - down approach by studying the physical properties of whole chromosomes that have been extracted from nuclei preparing for cell division . via micropipette manipulation of these mitotic chromosomes",
    "it was demonstrated that they are extremely deformable by an externally applied tension @xcite and that a change in ionic strength induces a hypercondensation or decondensation of the chromosome , respectively @xcite .",
    "meiotic and mitotic chromosomes were compared to simple polymer systems like brushes and gels @xcite .",
    "a problem with this bottom - down approach is still the lack of knowledge of the chromosome structure at this level and of the proteins that cause them .",
    "i will therefore dispense with giving a discussion on this subject .",
    "this review is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "i give a discussion of single nucleosome problems . after providing some experimental facts on the structure of the nucleosome ( section 2.1 ) ,",
    "i discuss simple model systems ( section 2.2 ) , the unwrapping transition ( section 2.3 ) and the nucleosome repositioning ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "section 3 features the next level of folding , the 30-nm fiber .",
    "i briefly review some of the proposed models ( section 3.1 ) and then give a systematic account on the crossed - linker model ( sections 3.2 and 3.3 ) and its mechanical response to stretching , bending and twisting ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "then fiber swelling ( section 3.5 ) is discussed .",
    "section 4 gives a conclusion and outlook .",
    "the structure of the nucleosome core particle is known in exquisite detail from x - ray crystallography : the octamer in absence of the dna was resolved at 3.1   resolution @xcite and the crystal structure of the complete core particle at 2.8   resolution @xcite and recently at 1.9   @xcite .",
    "the octamer is composed of two molecules each of the four core histone proteins h2a , h2b , h3 and h4 .",
    "each histone protein has in common a similar central domain composed of three @xmath15-helices connected by two loops .",
    "these central domains associate pairwise in form of a characteristic  handshake   motif which leads to crescent - shaped heterodimers , namely h3 with h4 and h2a with h2b . these four  histone - fold ",
    "dimers are put together in such a way that they form a cylinder with @xmath16   diameter and @xmath1760 height . with grooves , ridges and relatively specific binding sites they define the wrapping path of the dna , a left - handed helical ramp of 1 and @xmath18 turns , 147 bp length and a @xmath19 pitch .",
    "in fact , the dimers themselves are placed in the octamer in such a way that they follow this solenoid : they form a tetrapartite , left - handed superhelix , a spiral of the four heterodimers ( h2a - h2b)@xmath20 , ( h3-h4)@xmath20 , ( h3-h4)@xmath21 and ( h2a - h2b)@xmath22 .",
    "this aggregate has a two - fold axis of symmetry ( the dyad axis ) that goes through the ( h3-h4)@xmath23-tetramer apex and is perpendicular to the superhelix axis . a schematic view of the nucleosome core particle is given in fig .  2 .",
    "there are fourteen regions where the wrapped dna contacts the octamer surface , documented in great detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and davey02 .",
    "these regions are located where the minor grooves of the right - handed dna double helix face inwards towards the surface of the octamer .",
    "each crescent - shaped heterodimer has three contact points , two at its tips and one in the middle , altogether making up 12 of the 14 contacts .",
    "furthermore , at each end of the wrapped section ( the termini of the superhelix ) there is a helical extension of the nearby h3 histone making contact to a minor groove . at each contact region",
    "there are several direct hydrogen bonds between histone proteins and the dna sugar - phosphate backbone @xcite as well as bridging water molecules @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is also always a ( cationic ) arginine side chain extending into the dna minor groove .",
    "the free energies of binding at each sticking point is different which can be concluded from the fact that for each binding site there is a different number of hydrogen bonds located at different positions ; this is also reflected in the fluctuations of the dna phosphate groups in the nucleosome crystal @xcite .",
    "however , a reliable quantitative estimate of these energies is still missing .    an indirect method to estimate the adsorption energies at the sticking points",
    "is based on studies of competitive protein binding to nucleosomal dna @xcite .",
    "many proteins are not able to bind to dna when it is wrapped on the histone spool due to steric hindrance from the octamer surface .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations temporarily expose portions of the nucleosomal dna via the unwrapping from either end of the superhelix .",
    "it was demonstrated that sites which are cut by certain restriction enzymes showed  compared to naked dna  an increased resistance to digestion by these enzymes when they are associated to the octamer .",
    "furthermore , the farer these sites are apart from the termini of the superhelix the less frequent they become exposed for cutting .",
    "the rate for digestion is reduced roughly by a factor @xmath24 for sites at the superhelical termini and @xmath25 for sites close to the center of the nucleosomal dna portion ( i.e. , close to the dyad axis ) . from these findings",
    "one can estimate that the adsorption energy per sticking point is of order @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath27 do not represent the _ pure _ adsorption energy but instead the _ net _ gain in energy which is left after the dna has been bent around the octamer to make contact to the sticking point .",
    "a rough estimate of this deformation energy can be given by describing the dna as a semiflexible chain with a persistence length @xmath28 of @xmath17500   @xcite .",
    "then the elastic energy @xcite required to bend the 127 bp of dna around the octamer ( 10 bp at each terminus are essentially straight @xcite ) is given by @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the bent part of the wrapped dna , @xmath31 @xmath32   and @xmath33 is the radius of curvature of the centerline of the wrapped dna ( cf .",
    "2 ) which is roughly 43   @xcite . hence",
    ", the bending energy is of order @xmath34 .",
    "this number , however , has to be taken with caution .",
    "first of all it is not clear if eq .",
    "[ bend ] is still a good approximation for such strong curvatures .",
    "then it is known that the dna does not bend uniformly around the octamer @xcite and finally the dna might show modified elastic properties due to its contacts with the octamer . nevertheless , using this number one is led to the conclusion that the bending energy per ten basepairs , i.e. , per sticking site , is of order @xmath35 .",
    "together with the observation that the net gain per sticking point is @xmath36 this means that the pure adsorption energy is on average @xmath37 per binding site .",
    "note that the huge pure adsorption energy of @xmath38 per nucleosome is cancelled to a large extend by the @xmath39 from the dna bending , a fact that has important consequences for the unwrapping transition discussed in section 2.3 and especially , for the nucleosome repositioning reviewed in section 2.4 .    of great importance",
    "are also flexible , irregular tail regions of the core histones which make up @xmath1728% of their sequences @xcite .",
    "each histone has a highly positively charged , flexible tail ( which is the n - end of the polypeptide chain @xcite ) that extends out of the nucleosome structure .",
    "some of them exit between the two turns of the wrapped dna , others on the top or bottom of the octameric cylinder .",
    "these n - tails are extremely basic due to a high amount of lysine and arginine aminoacids ( aa s ) .",
    "they are sites of posttranslational modification and are crucial for chromatin regulation .",
    "especially , the tails have a strong influence on the structure of the 30 nm chromatin fiber as i will discuss in more detail in section 3 .",
    "x - ray scattering data on core particles @xcite suggest that the tails are adsorbed on the complex for small ionic strengths and extended at high salt concentrations ( cf .",
    "fig . 8 in that paper ) . if the octamer is associated with a longer dna piece the n - tails desorb at higher ionic strength .",
    "finally , let me mention the amount of charges found on the nucleosome core particle @xcite .",
    "the histone octamer contains 220 basic side chains ( arginine and lysine ) . from these",
    "are about 103 located in the flexible histone tails mentioned above .",
    "the rest , 117 residues , are in the globular part of the octamer , of which 31 are exposed to the solvent , the rest being involved in intra- and interprotein ionic interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "one has 147 bp of dna wrapped around the octamer , each contributing two phosphate groups .",
    "hence there are 294 negative charges from the dna versus 220 positive charges of the octamer ( or even less , 134  not counting the charges buried inside the octamer ) , i.e. , the nucleosomal complex is overcharged by the dna . at first sight this is a surprising fact and indeed led to the development of simplified toy models containing charged spheres and oppositely charged chains which i will discuss in the following section .",
    "the complexation of ( semi-)flexible polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged macroions is an important ingredient in biological processes .",
    "for instance , the non - specific part of the interaction between dna and proteins is governed by electrostatics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nucleosome is an example of this kind of interaction . a number of experimental braunlin82,mascotti90,raedler97,koltover99 and theoretical studies park99,record78,bruinsma98,harries98,sens00 have demonstrated that the complexation of _ highly _ charged macroions ( e.g. dna ) is governed by an unusual electrostatics mechanism : _",
    "counterion release_. the free energy of complexation is then dominated by the entropy increase of the released counterions that had been condensed before complexation .",
    "this electrostatic contribution to the free energy has to compete with the energy cost of deforming one or both macromolecules to bring them in close contact .    in the next section",
    "i discuss how the counterion release leads to an overcharged sphere - chain complex which might be considered as a simplified model system of the nucleosome .",
    "i also consider the case of a polyelectrolyte chain placed in a solution of oppositely charged spheres ( section 2.2.2 ) .",
    "both sections follow closely the treatments given in refs .",
    "afterwards i review studies where it was found that overcharging occurs also in weakly charged systems due to  standard  electrostatics ( section 2.2.3 ) .",
    "section 2.2.4 is devoted to physiological conditions ( strong screening ) and also to the question whether such toy models can  explain  the large net charge of nucleosomes .",
    "consider a single sphere of radius @xmath33 with its charge @xmath40 homogeneously smeared out over the surface ( the  octamer  ) and a flexible rod with a charge per unit length @xmath41 , persistence length @xmath28 , contour length @xmath42 and radius @xmath43 ( the  dna chain  ) .",
    "both are placed in a salt solution characterized by a bjerrum length @xmath44 ( @xmath45 : dielectric constant of the solvent ; in water @xmath46 and @xmath47  at room temperature ) and a debye screening length @xmath48 ; furthermore the solvent is treated as a continuum .",
    "clearly , such a model neglects all the intricate features of the nucleosome discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "it is , however , indispensable to start from such a simple model system to identify general features that occur in polyelectrolyte - macroion complexes .",
    "i will focus in this section on salt concentrations @xmath49 that are sufficiently small such that @xmath50 is large compared to the sphere radius , @xmath51 .",
    "the persistence length is assumed large compared with @xmath33 .",
    "the chain is here highly charged which means that the so - called _ manning parameter _ @xmath52 is required to be much larger than one . in this case",
    "@xmath53 counterions are condensed on the chain reducing the effective line charge density to the value @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the entropic cost to  confine  a counterion close to the chain is @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following entropic electrostatic charging free energy of the isolated chain in the salt solution : @xmath57 on the other hand the corresponding electrostatic charging free energy of the spherical macroion of charge @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xcite and @xmath61 ( see below ) .",
    "for weakly charged spheres ( @xmath62 ) @xmath63 is the usual electrostatic charging energy . in the highly charged case , @xmath64 ,",
    "most of the counterions are localized close to the sphere with an entropic cost @xmath65 per counterion leading to eq .",
    "[ fcs ] for @xmath64 .",
    "only the small fraction @xmath66 of counterions is still free leading to an effective sphere charge @xmath67 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 follows from the balance of electrostatic charging energy @xmath68 and counterion entropy @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the total free energy of the sphere - chain complex can be determined as follows .",
    "assume that a length @xmath30 of the chain has been wrapped around the sphere .",

    "however , the estimate for @xmath405 from eq .  [ lamda ] is not reliable since @xmath406   ( partial screening ) , since the binding sites between dna and the histones are quite specific and since linear debye - hckel theory is not reliable for such highly charged components .",
    "as mentioned in section 2.1 @xmath236 can be derived instead experimentally from competitive protein binding to nucleosomal dna @xcite to be of order @xmath407 per sticking point , i.e. , @xmath408 @xmath409 .",

    "the completely wrapped configuration is not stable at this point anymore .",
    "this is not surprising since the nucleosomal dna overcharges the protein octamer by at least 74 negative charges ( if not by 160 charges since 86 charged residues are inside the octamer , cf .",
    "section 2.1 ) .",
    "hence it is expected that a considerable part of the terminal dna unwraps and is part of one or two tails . in fig .",
    "8 this corresponds to the wrapped chain structures with tail that are found for small values of @xmath412 and large values of @xmath347",
    ".    it would be interesting to redo the experiments @xcite mentioned in section 2.3.1 with complexes between histone octamers and dna segments that are longer than 147 basepairs .",
    "for sufficiently large salt concentrations i expect the formation of dna rosettes ( if there is no interference with the partial disintegration of the octamer which could be avoided by introducing covalent linkages between the core histones ) . for the other limit ( low salt ) it might be appropriate to use the argument for highly charged chains and spheres as given before eq .",
    "[ lleaf2 ] .",
    "the linear charge density of dna is very high ( 2 phosphate groups per bp , i.e. , per 3.4  ) . manning theory",
    "@xcite indeed predicts that counterion condensation reduces the linear charge density to @xmath54 with @xmath47  .",
    "also the charge of the histone octamer is so high that counterion condensation is important .",
    "it was argued above that the unwrapping occurs around @xmath413 ( @xmath414 and @xmath415 are numbers of order ( but larger than ) one ) .",
    "however , since the dna persistence length is so small that @xmath41650 @xmath417 @xmath418   i expect the wrapped state to be stable at low ionic strength and there should be no formation of rosettes in this limit .",
    "it has been shown that nucleosome repositioning occurs spontaneously via thermal fluctuations ( under certain conditions ) .",
    "this autonomous repositioning is the subject of the current section .",
    "i first review the relevant experiments ( 2.4.1 ) and then discuss three theoretical models proposed to account for this effect : bulge diffusion ( 2.4.2 ) , large loop repositioning ( 2.4.3 ) and twist diffusion ( 2.4.4 ) .",
    "i contrast the three cases in section 2.4.5 and speculate that similar modes might be catalyzed by remodeling complexes that use the energy of atp hydrolysis .",
    "nucleosome repositioning induced through transcription on short dna segments is also briefly discussed in that section .",
    "an early study of uncatalyzed nucleosome repositioning was presented by beard @xcite .",
    "he constructed ",
    "chromatin - dna - hybrids  where segments of radioactively labelled naked dna were covalently joined to sections of chromatin fibers ( derived from a simian virus ) .",
    "remarkably the experiments suggested that nucleosomes spontaneously reposition themselves and invade the naked dna .",
    "this was shown by several experimental methods : ( _ i _ ) the occurrence of a radioactive component in the @xmath419 bp - band of a gel electrophoresis experiment that separated the products of a nuclease digestion .",
    "( _ ii _ ) electron - micrographs showed an increased spacing of the nucleosomes on the chromatin pieces and ( _ iii _ ) binding of radioactive components of the recut hybrids on nitrocellulose filters ( to which naked dna would not bind under the given conditions ) .",
    "all these methods indicated that something",
    " happens  on the time scale of hours in a 150 mm nacl solution at elevated temperatures ( @xmath420c ) .",
    "the methods used gave , however , not more quantitative information about the nucleosome migration rate .",
    "furthermore , the conditions were not well - defined enough to exclude atp - driven processes .",
    "finally , the histone tails belonging to the virial dna were strongly acetylated compared to the  normal  chromatin of its host cell ( which  as shown much later  has not a big effects on nucleosome mobility , see below ) .    in that paper beard",
    "discussed also three different possible modes of nucleosome repositioning : ( a ) jumping where the octamer dissociates _",
    "completely _ from the dna and complexes at another position ,",
    "( b ) sliding or rolling in which the octamer moves along the dna without dissociation and ( c ) displacement transfer where a naked segment of the dna displaces a nucleosomal dna section and takes over .",
    "beard argues that two of the mechanism ( jumping and displacement transfer ) imply that in the presence of competing dna nucleosomes would be transferred from one dna chain to another , a fact that was not observed in his experiment when chromosomes and radioactively labelled , naked dna were mixed together .",
    "nucleosomes could only migrate onto the naked dna when the chromosome and dna pieces were covalently joined .",
    "beard concluded that  sliding and rolling modes  should be responsible for octamer repositioning .",
    "spadafora , oudet and chambon @xcite showed via gel electrophoresis that nucleosomal rearrangement occurs in fragments of rat liver chromatin when certain conditions are fulfilled : either one needs to go to high ionic strength above @xmath421 nacl or the fiber has to be depleted of the linker histone h1 ; in that case rearrangement occurred also around physiological conditions .",
    "it was observed that when either of these conditions is fulfilled _ and _ if temperatures are elevated ( again @xmath420c ) , then nucleosomes seem to move closer to each other ( in the time range of hours ) , away from the natural 200 bp repeat length towards a @xmath422140 bp repeat length . that length corresponds to a close packing of nucleosomes , a fact that the authors assigned to an internucleosomal attraction .",
    "furthermore , since h1 is dissociated from the nucleosome at around 600 mm salt content they concluded that one role of h1 is to prevent nucleosome mobility .",
    "similar conclusions were also drawn by watkins and smerdon @xcite from corresponding experiments on human chromatin .",
    "an interesting additional experiment studied the exchange of histone proteins between different dna chains .",
    "this was shown by mixing @xmath423c labelled chromatin and @xmath424h labelled naked dna .",
    "it became clear that at _ high _ ionic strength ( 600 mm ) there is a formation of ( probably intact ) nucleosomes on the competing dna whereas at physiological conditions this was not unambiguously detected .",
    "moreover , the double - radioactive component showed the footprint of a @xmath17146 bp repeat length .",
    "this might indicate that a combination of histone protein transfer and subsequent nucleosome  sliding  into tight packing took place .",
    "an important series of experiments on nucleosome repositioning under rather well - defined conditions was performed by pennings , meersseman and bradbury @xcite .",
    "even though the original focus of this study was to understand better the _ positioning _ of nucleosomes on special natural sequences that have a high affinity to octamers simpson83 , the authors came up with elegant methods to monitor the nucleosome _ re_positioning .",
    "it was found @xcite that on tandem repeats of 5s rdna positioning sequences ( each of length 207 bp ) nucleosomes assemble in one dominant position surrounded by minor positions multiples of 10 bp apart .",
    "the most interesting observation was that there is a dynamic redistribution between these positions .",
    "this was shown by cutting the 207@xmath425 chromatin into its repeating subunits and then studying the nucleosome dynamics on such 207 bp fragments .",
    "the authors took advantage of the fact that different nucleosome positions on the chain give rise to different electrophoretic mobilities and that the motion of the nucleosome along the chain can be suppressed by subphysiological temperatures or ionic strengths , and by the presence of mg@xmath426 .",
    "the 207 bp mononucleosomes were first separated by an initial dimension of the electrophoresis in conditions where mobility is suppressed . in this way they obtained different bands indicating a set of preferred positions .",
    "an entire track from such a gel was then incubated for some period of time in new conditions where mobility may occur , then changed back to physiological conditions where mobility is suppressed again , and run in a _",
    "second _ , equivalent , dimension of gel electrophoresis .",
    "essentially , the first dimension of electrophoresis created a nonequilibrium distribution .",
    "depending on the conditions this distribution relaxed during the subsequent incubation , which in turn was detected as products moving off the diagonal in the second dimension of electrophoresis  cf .",
    "fig .  10 for a schematic depiction of the two - dimensional separation technique .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that substantial redistribution took place when the sample was incubated for an 1 hour at @xmath427c but not at @xmath428c .",
    "the experiments were done in low ionic conditions in a tris - borate buffer ( 0.5@xmath429tbe ; cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the effects of this buffer on naked dna ) .",
    "there was a set of preferred positions , all multiples of 10 bp ( the dna helical pitch ) apart .",
    "that means that the nucleosomes had all the same rotational positioning with respect to the dna .",
    "another feature that was observed is that the nucleosomes have a preference for a positioning at the ends of the dna fragments , a typical feature for nucleosomes on short dna that was recently discussed by sakaue et al .",
    "the 5s rdna positioning sequence itself , however , is located more towards the middle .",
    "when gel - separating the mononucleosomes directly after they have been excised from the tandemly repeated nucleosomes this position led indeed to the strongest band .",
    "after incubation , however , the end positions showed the highest probability .",
    "the authors extended their study to head - to - tail dimers of 5s rdna ( 207@xmath23 ) @xcite . in a first dimension of a 2d gel electrophoresis",
    "the mononucleosomes were separated according to their position on the dimer .",
    "this was followed by an incubation at @xmath430 or @xmath431c and a subsequent cutting of the dimer into its monomers .",
    "the resulting product was then separated through electrophoresis in a second dimension .",
    "again for the sample incubated at elevated temperatures a repositioning of the nucleosomes was found .",
    "interestingly , however , the study indicated that the repositioning took place only within a cluster of positions around each positioning sequence but not between them , a fact that was shown by radioactive labelling of one half .",
    "this finding indicates that there is no  long - range  repositioning at low ionic strength .",
    "other systems studied in that paper were fragments of h1-depleted native chromatin and nucleosomes reconstituted on _ alu _ repeats ; also in these cases a repositioning was detected as a result of an elevated temperature incubation .",
    "the authors concluded that the repositioning  may be visualized as following a corc screw movement within the superhelical path of the dna  meersseman92 .",
    "the same authors studied in ref .",
    "@xcite the nucleosome mobility on the 207@xmath432-dimer in the presence of linker histone h1 ( or its avian counterpart h5 ) and found that the mobility of nucleosomes was dramatically reduced .",

    "@xcite  studied nucleosome mobility on the 207@xmath23-dimer under varying conditions , namely in the presence of various chromosomal proteins and in the case when the core histones are acetylated , respectively . in the former case mobility",
    "was suppressed ( depending on the type and concentration of the chromosomal protein ) , in the latter case the mobility was not changed much .",
    "flaus et al .",
    "@xcite developed a different strategy to determine nucleosome positioning and repositioning . in their method",
    "they used a chemically modified h4 histone that induces ",
    "after addition of some chemical  a cut on the nucleosomal dna 2 bp away from the dyad axis . via gel electrophoresis of the resulting product they were able to determine the nucleosome position with base pair resolution . using this method flaus and",
    "richmond @xcite studied the nucleosome dynamics on a mouse mammary tumor sequence which revealed several features of repositioning more clearly .",
    "the longest fragment of this sequence studied was 438 bp long and had two positioning sequences where two nucleosomes assembled , each at a unique position .",
    "these positions were also found when mononucleosomes were assembled on shorter fragments that included only one of the two positioning sequences .",
    "the authors studied the degree of repositioning of the mononucleosomes on such shorter fragments ( namely nucleosome a on a 242 bp- and nucleosome b on a 219 bp - fragment ) as a function of heating time ( ranging from 20 to 80 minutes ) and temperature ( ranging from @xmath433 to @xmath434c ) .",
    "it was found that the repositioning rates  as estimated from the occurrence and intensity of new bands  increase strongly with temperature but also depend on the positioning sequence ( and/or length of the fragment ) .",
    "the difference of repositioning for the two sequences is remarkable : at 37@xmath435c one has to wait @xmath436 minutes for the a242 and more than 30 hours for the b219 for having half of the material repositioned .",
    "another feature found was again a preference for end positions ( roughly 70 bp from the dyad axis , similar to the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for nucleosome b which showed a slower repositioning",
    "the set of new positions were all multiples of 10 bp apart ( namely at a 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 bp - distance from the starting position ) , i.e. , they all had the same rotational phase .",
    "on the other hand , nucleosome a did not show such a clear preference for the rotational positioning .",
    "it was argued that these differences reflect specific features of the underlying base pair sequences involved .",
    "nucleosome b is complexed with a dna sequence that has aa / at / ta / tt dinucleotides that show a 10 bp periodicity inducing a bend on the dna whereas nucleosome a is positioned via homonucleotide tracts .",
    "the authors speculate in ref .",
    "@xcite that the preference of end positions might be caused by one ( or several ) of the following mechanisms ( 1 ) direct histone interaction with a special structure at the dna terminus , ( 2 ) relief of the repulsion between entering and exiting strand and ( 3 ) entropy gain by having a long unbound dna extension .",
    "recently hamiche et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the ( uncatalyzed ) nucleosome mobility along dna depends on the presence of histone tails .",
    "especially , in the absence of the n - tail of h2b that passes in between the two turns of the nucleosomal dna @xcite spontaneous repositioning of the nucleosomes was detected ( here _ during _ a gel electrophoresis in a second direction ) .",
    "how does repositioning work ?",
    "the studies seem to indicate that the octamer is not transferred to competing dna ( at least hardly under physiological conditions , cf .",
    "it is also clear that repositioning should preferably not involve the simultaneous dissociation of all the 14 bindings sites which would be too costly to be induced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "a mechanism that requires only the breakage of a few contacts is loop diffusion . strictly speaking one",
    "has to distinguish here between two different kinds of loops : small loops or bulges ( 2.4.2 ) and big loops ( 2.4.3 ) that show a qualitative different energetics and lead also to a different picture of the overall nucleosome repositioning dynamics .",
    "another possibility could be the above mentioned corkscrew motion as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and even before by van holde and yager @xcite ) .",
    "this could be facilitated through the twist diffusion of small defects that will only require to break one or two contacts at a time , a mechanism discussed in section 2.4.4 .      in ref .",
    "@xcite myself , widom , bruinsma and gelbart argued that the repositioning of nucleosomes without dissociation from the dna chain that wraps them might be possible through the diffusional motion of small intra - nucleosomal loops .",
    "this biological process is analogous to the familiar physical situation of reptation of  stored length  in polymer chains .",
    "thirty years ago de gennes degennes71 discussed the motion of a flexible chain trapped in a gel , modelled by a matrix of fixed point - like obstacles that can not be crossed by the polymer . fig .",
    "11 depicts schematically the mechanism whereby diffusion of these  defects  of stored length @xmath437 gives rise to overall translation of the chain .",
    "specifically , when the loop moves through the monomer at _ b _ , this monomer is displaced by a distance _  _ @xmath438 .",
    "de gennes wrote down a conservation equation for this motion of defects along the trapped chain and calculated its overall mobility , and thereby , in particular , the molecular - weight dependence of the overall translation diffusion coefficient . in our present situation",
    "the reptation dynamics do not arise from obstacles due to a host matrix ( as in a gel ) or to other chains ( as in a melt ) , but rather to loops associated with unsaturated adsorption of the dna on the protein complex .",
    "similar physics arise in the lateral displacements of a linear polymer adsorbed on a bulk solid surface .",
    "sukhishvili et al .",
    "sukhishvili00,sukhishvili02 , for example , have measured the translational motion of adsorbed polyethylene glycol ( peg ) on functionalized ( hydrophobic ) silica , specifically the dependence of its center - of - mass diffusion constant on molecular weight .",
    "they find an unusual scaling behavior  but one that can be accounted for by slack between sticking points , so that lateral motion of the polymer proceeds via a caterpillar - like diffusion of chain loops . in the case of intra - nucleosomal loops considered in this section ,",
    "one is essentially in the limit of infinite molecular weight , because of the chain length being large compared to the bead ( solid substrate ) diameter .",
    "furthermore , one deals with a lower dimensional problem , since the dna chain is wrapped ( absorbed ) on a 1d path rather than a 2d surface .",
    "but the basic features of loop formation and diffusion , and subsequent motion of the overall chain  in particular the exclusive role of equilibrium fluctuations in driving these processes  are the same in both cases",
    ".     passes through a monomer at @xmath439 it is moved by that amount to a new position @xmath440.,width=264 ]    as shown in earlier studies of competitive protein binding to nucleosomal dna @xcite , thermal fluctuations lead to lengths of the chain becoming unwrapped at the ends of its adsorbed portion . if some length of linker is pulled in before the chain re - adsorbs , then an intra - nucleosomal loop is formed  see fig .",
    "12(b ) . in ref .",
    "schiessel01c we calculated first the equilibrium shape and length distribution of these loops , in terms of the chain bending stiffness @xmath247 , adsorption energy per unit length @xmath236 , and protein aggregate size @xmath160 ( to be more precise : the radius of curvature of the dna centerline ) .",
    "we then considered the diffusion of these loops from one end of the nucleosome to the other .",
    "finally , treating this motion as the elementary step in the diffusion of the nucleosome itself along the wrapping chain , we were able to make estimates of the nucleosome repositioning rates as a function of @xmath247 , @xmath441 , @xmath33 , and solvent viscosity @xmath442 .",
    "i present here ( in more detail than in our letter @xcite ) the calculation of the equilibrium statistical mechanical probability associated with the formation of a _ small _ intra - nucleosomal loop ( large loops are considered in the next section ) .",
    "when no loops are present , a nucleosome consists of a length @xmath30 of dna chain wrapped continuously around the octamer , see fig .",
    "in reality , as discussed in section 2.1 , the configuration of the adsorbed chain is a left - handed superhelix ( of contour length @xmath30 ) spanning the full height of a cylinder .",
    "one can proceed , however , without making any explicit assumptions about the shapes of either the histone octamer or the wrapped dna .",
    "consider a fluctuation in which some length of the chain becomes unwrapped ( this can _ only _ happen at the end of the adsorbed portion of chain ) and simultaneously some length , say @xmath438 , of linker ( i.e. , previously unadsorbed chain ) is  pulled in  before the chain re - adsorbs .",
    "the fluctuation has then produced a loop of contour length @xmath443 where @xmath444 is the  exposed  length of nucleosome associated with the loop ; see fig .",
    "note that @xmath438 shows a strong preference for values that are multiples of 10 bp lengths , since this is the periodicity of the dna helical pitch ( binding sites are located where minor grooves face inwards to the octamer , cf .",
    "section 2.1 ) ; other values require a twisting of the loop dna which is energetically costly . for the energy associated with forming a loop of this kind ,",
    "one can write @xcite : @xmath445 the first term is the bending energy of the loop with @xmath248 being the local curvature at distance @xmath233 along its contour , cf . also eq .",
    "the second term accounts for the length @xmath444 which has been adsorbed and bent with curvature @xmath80 _ before _ loop formation .",
    "the mathematical details of the functional minimization of @xmath446 , eq .  [ deltau ] , are presented in appendix b. there it is shown that the formation energy of an optimal small loop for given extra length @xmath438 is approximately given by into eq .

    "@xcite one finds @xmath621 and @xmath622 .",
    "furthermore , the probability to leave at the left end is @xmath623 and at the right end @xmath624 @xcite which gives the life time as the weighted average @xmath625 .",
    "only a fraction @xmath626 of the defects reaches the other end and will lead to a repositioning step , i.e. , the time of one diffusion step of the nucleosome along the dna is of order @xmath627 where use was made of the above presented relations between the time scales . from this follows then directly the diffusion constant @xmath117 of the nucleosome along the dna : @xmath628 ( with @xmath629 nm ) .",
    "therefore we find a diffusion constant that is _ much _ larger than the one expected for the repositioning via bulges ( @xmath630 , cf .",
    ". [ diff ] ) .",
    "most importantly , it is also orders of magnitude larger than the diffusion constant observed in the experiments .",
    "how can this apparent inconsistency be resolved ?",
    "most likely , the diffusion is considerably slowed down due to the quenched disorder stored in the base pair sequence of the dna .",
    "in fact , the bulk of the repositioning experiments has been made on dna with rather strong positioning sequences leading to a strong rotational positioning of the nucleosome .",
    "starting from a preferred position the nucleosome would arrive already after 5 steps to the left ( or to the right ) on the ",
    "site of the nucleosome  forcing the dna to be bent in an unfavorable direction .",
    "this means that the nucleosome needs to cross a barrier in order to reach a position 10 bp apart .",
    "for instance , in the case of the 5s rdna sequence theoretical estimates indicate a barrier height of the order @xmath631 mattei02,anselmi00 .",
    "this leads to a strong reduction of the effective diffusion constant , namely @xmath632  a value comparable to the one found for bulge diffusion . in ref .",
    "@xcite we formally include these effects into the frenkel - kontorova framework by introducing an octamer - fixed bending field and by attributing  bending charges  to the beads .",
    "this allows us to give a rough quantitative treatment of the nucleosome mobility as a function of the underlying base pair sequence .      comparing the different repositioning mechanisms presented in the previous sections one has to conclude that they lead to very different  sliding  scenarios . on _ short _ dna fragments repositioning could in principle work via bulge ( section 2.4.2 ) or twist diffusion ( section 2.4.4 )",
    "; large loops can not occur because there is not enough free dna length available .",
    "bulge diffusion is rather slow ( timescale of hours ) since the formation of a small loop is costly  mainly because the opening angle of a bulge is rather large leading to several open binding sites .",
    "the repositioning rates should show a strong temperature dependence as well as a strong dependence on the adsorption strength ( i.e. , a strong dependence on the ionic conditions ) .",
    "the preferred repositioning steps are multiples of ten base pairs",
    ".    on the other hand repositioning via twist defects should be much faster ( timescale of seconds ) .",
    "the nucleosome should slide in a cork screw motion along the dna and should forget its initial position rather quickly .",
    "however , if the underlying dna sequence induces a strong rotational positioning signal the timescale becomes comparable to that of small loop repositioning .",
    "even more , due to the underlying base pair sequence one should expect a 10 bp spacing between the dominant positions that is , however , here not the result of 10 bp jumps but just reflects the relative boltzmann weights of favorable and unfavorable positions .",
    "the estimates of the diffusion constants of these two mechanisms are too unreliable ( activation energies appear in the exponent ! ) to allow one to predict which of the mechanisms should be favored .",
    "if on the other hand a rather homogenous dna sequence is used , our prediction is that cork screw motion is the much faster and therefore predominant mechanism .",
    "the experiment by flaus and richmond @xcite goes already in this direction ; comparing their experimental results ( cf .",
    "section 2.4.1 ) with the theoretical pictures seems to point towards sliding motion for one of the positioning sequences ( the one that has a homonucleotide tract ) whereas it is not clear whether the nucleosome escapes from the rotational positioning trap via bulge or via twist diffusion .    on _ long _ dna fragments single nucleosomes",
    "could also be repositioned via large loops ( section 2.4.3 ) .",
    "our theoretical model suggests that large loop repositioning would be much faster than bulge diffusion .",
    "also it should be expected that a similar mechanism allows the nucleosome to be transferred to competing naked dna chains . as discussed in the experimental section above",
    "there is , however , not much evidence for such processes . only watkins and smerdon @xcite report such a nucleosome transfer to free dna at higher ionic strength .",
    "this again allows to speculate that each of the different mechanisms might play a dominant role in a certain parameter range . to come to more definite conclusions more systematic experiments have to be made on short as well as long dna molecules with and without positioning sequences under varying ionic conditions .",

    "there are two major families : swi / snf and iswi .",
    "they both burn atp to enhance nucleosome dynamics but their underlying modes of action seem to be fundamentally different .",
    "the swi / snf class disrupts many of the dna - nucleosome contacts making the nucleosomal dna vulnerable to dna digestion .",
    "it has been even observed that some of these complexes are capable to transfer the octamer to another dna chain @xcite .",
    "this might indicate that their mode of action is the creation of large loops ( similar to the one discussed in section 2.4.3 ) that could lead to large repositioning steps .",
    "in fact , bazett - jones et al .",
    "@xcite observed that the swi / snf complex creates loops on naked dna as well as on bead - on - string nucleosome fibers ( cf .",
    "the electron spectroscopic images , fig .  1 and 3",
    ", in that paper )",
    ". on the other hand , the mode of action of the iswi family seems not to interrupt the nucleosome - dna contact on an appreciable level .",
    "since these complexes induce nucleosome repositioning it has been speculated that they might work via twist or bulge diffusion . in the meantime the latter mechanism",
    "seems to be more likely since iswi induced nucleosome sliding appears even if the dna is nicked and hence a torsion can not be transmitted between the complex and the nucleosome to be shifted @xcite .",
    "another interesting and very prominent system known to mediate nucleosome repositioning is unexpectedly the rna polymerase .",
    "it is found to be able to transcribe dna through nucleosomes without disrupting their structure , yet moving them _ upstream _ the dna template , i.e. , in the opposite direction of transcription studitsky94,studitsky95,felsenfeld96,studitsky97,felsenfeld00 . to rationalize this seemingly paradoxical finding felsenfeld et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a model which assumes that the polymerase crosses the nucleosome in a loop .",
    "this would indeed explain the backwards directionality of repositioning .",
    "note that such a loop would have a different shape than the ones discussed above since polymerases induce a kink at the dna with a preferential angle of @xmath633 @xcite .",
    "this means , however , that an rna polymerase sitting in an intranucleosomal loop would soon get stuck since it transcribes the dna in a cork screw fashion ; this would complicate this mechanism @xcite .",
    "it might well be that this effect only occurs on short dna fragments as used in the experiments .",
    "if so , it would be an artefact that would not work _ in vivo_. in that case another mechanism , namely induced cork screw motion of the bound dna towards the polymerase and subsequently the recapturing of the nucleosome at its exposed binding sites by the other end of the dna fragment might also be a possible scenario @xcite .",
    "whereas the structure of the core particle has been resolved up to atomic resolution  @xcite , there is still considerable controversy about the nature of the higher - order structures to which they give rise .",
    "when stretched , the string of dna / histone complexes has the appearance of beads - on - a - string .",

    "there is a longstanding controversial discussion concerning the structure of the 30-nm fiber @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two competing classes of models : the solenoid models thoma79,finch76,widom85 ; and the zig - zag or crossed - linker models woodcock93,horowitz94,leuba94,bednar98,schiessel01b , woodcock01 . in the solenoid model ( depicted in fig .",
    "18(a ) ) it is assumed that the chain of nucleosomes forms a helical structure with the axis of the core particles being perpendicular to the solenoid axis .",
    "the dna entry - exit side faces inward towards the axis of the solenoid . the linker dna ( shown as a thick lines at the bottom of fig .",
    "18(a ) ) is required to bent in order to connect neighboring nucleosomes in the solenoid which in turn requires strong nucleosome - nucleosome interactions to hold this structure together .",
    "the other class of models posits straight linkers that connect nucleosomes located on opposite sides of the fiber .",
    "this results in a three - dimensional zig - zag - like pattern of the linker ( cf .",

    "images obtained by electron cryomicroscopy @xcite should in principle be able to distinguish between the structural features predicted by the two different models .",
    "the micrographs show a zig - zag motif at lower salt concentrations and they indicate that the chromatin fiber becomes more and more compact when the ionic strength is raised towards the physiological value .",
    "a similar picture emerges also from atomic force microscopy @xcite .",

    "so far computer simulations katritch00 as well as analytical approaches @xcite to chromatin fiber stretching seem  when comparing their predictions to the experimental data  to support the crossed linker models .",
    "another intriguing way that might allow to discriminate experimentally between these two types of structures is to measure the fiber orientation in strong magnetic fields  as it has been done already long ago @xcite .",
    "such a method has been used successfully to determine the persistence length of naked dna @xcite .",
    "one makes use of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of the base pairs that cause the dna double helix to orient its axis perpendicular to the field . as a consequence ,",
    "single core particles orient their dna superhelix axis parallel to the field @xcite . since the nucleosome axes in the two fiber models are oriented in different directions with respect to the fiber axis ( cf .",

    "to address the folding problem of dna at the level of the 30-nm fiber myself , gelbart and bruinsma @xcite introduced a mathematical description for the different possible folding pathways which was based on woodcock s crossed - linker model @xcite ( cf . also a related study on closed minichromosomes @xcite ) . at the simplest level , we assumed that the geometric structure of the 30-nm fiber can be obtained from the intrinsic , single - nucleosome structure .",

    "the theoretical and experimental values are close which indicates that the mechanical properties of a swollen fiber at low salt concentrations are mainly determined by the elasticity of its linker backbone .",
    "the nucleosomes are less important since they are not close enough in such a swollen fiber . for high stretching forces around 20 pn",
    "there is an irreversible change in the overall length of the fiber due to histone  evaporation  which has been seen more clearly in the other two stretching experiments ( see below ) .",

    "note that one finds with these values that the stretching modulus of the linker backbone , eq .",
    "[ gammaw ] , is of order @xmath860 pn , i.e. , even lower than the value 6.3 pn predicted above for low ionic strength . the fact that these fibers appear much stiffer with respect to ( small ) deformations indicates that its mechanical properties are mainly determined by the nucleosome - nucleosome attraction and _ not _ by the backbone elasticity .",

    "there is , however , an abundance of non - histone proteins some of which act close to the dna entry - exit point similar to linker histones . for small forces a stretch modulus @xmath862 pn was extracted from the data .",
    "this indicates again that chromatin fibers are quite stiff at high salt concentrations ( here 150 mm nacl ) compared to the pure linker backbone elasticity but still quite soft compared to naked dna ( @xmath863 pn ) . for stretching forces of order 20 pn irregular sawtooth - like fluctuations",
    "were observed , each being a result of a sudden fiber lengthening by multiples of @xmath16 nm .",
    "this was attributed to the unraveling of single or multiple nucleosomes .    finally , brower - toland et al .",
    "@xcite used well characterized fibers that were prepared from tandem repeats of the 5s rdna positioning sequence and core histones ( no linker histones ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "my discussion of that paper in section 2.4.1 ) most of the nucleosomes are localized at the preferred positions .",
    "around 20 pn the force - extension curve showed a regular sawtooth pattern reminiscent of the one observed during the unravelling of tandem repeat domains in the protein titin rief97,oberhauser01 .",
    "the spacing of the peaks , @xmath864 nm , is indicative of the unravelling of only one turn of the nucleosomal dna .",
    "the outer sections of the dna were detected to be released at much smaller forces .",
    "brower - toland et al .",
    "@xcite gave also a theoretical explanation of this observation : they speculate that the first 76 bp are unwrapped much more easily due to weaker binding between dna and the octamer whereas strong binding sites occur as soon as these first 76 bp are unwound .",
    "only when a sufficiently large force is applied these binding sites are broken on the time scale of the experiment .    however , this explanation is questionable since it does not take into account the actual unwinding geometry .",
    "already cui and bustamante cui00 pointed out that it requires a twisting of the core particle to unwrap the inner part of the nucleosomal dna .",
    "the free dna has to be bent strongly close the nucleosome which leads to a considerable barrier that has to be crossed during unwrapping .",
    "we are currently calculating this barrier analytically in the wlcframework @xcite .",
    "this high barrier might explain why the nucleosomes are dissociated only at surprisingly high tensions  even in the absence of linker histones .",
    "in fact , as marko and siggia pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , one would find nucleosome release ( and a corresponding plateau in the force - distance curve ) around 2 pn  if such a barrier could be neglected .",
    "this value follows from the comparison of adsorption energy ( @xmath865 , cf .",

    "i discuss how the entry - exit angle @xmath869 of the dna at the nucleosomes is controlled via electrostatics . a more detailed account on this subject",
    "is provided in ref .",
    "as mentioned above it can be seen in the cryo em studies  @xcite that the fibers open up and therefore become more accessible when the ionic strength is reduced and that this opening is directly linked to an increase in @xmath15 .",
    "it was suggested that via other mechanisms ( for instance , the acetylation of the lysine - rich histone tails  @xcite , as explained in more detail below ) the angle @xmath15 and therefore the degree of swelling can be changed for a given section of the fiber and that this constitutes a biochemical means to control the transcriptional activity of genes .",
    "whereas the x - ray studies of the core particle  @xcite allow a detailed knowledge of the wrapped part of the dna it does not give insight into the conformational properties of the entering and exiting strands .",
    "one has therefore to refer to the electron cryomicrographs . in these micrographs",
    "it can be seen clearly that 10 nm stretches of the entering and exiting dna strands are glued together forming a unique  stem motif  @xcite ( cf . also fig .",
    "the gluing of the two equally charged chains is accomplished  amongst other things  via the linker histone h1 as shown schematically in fig .",
    "23(b ) .        at physiological concentrations",
    "the electrostatics is essentially short - ranged ( @xmath404   for 100 mm salt ) .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to assume that @xmath15 is set within the small region where the two linker dna are in close contact , i.e. , within the stem region .",
    "this value of @xmath15 in turn controls the large - scale secondary structure of chromatin , the 30-nm fiber , as discussed in section 3.2 . to mimic this situation i assumed in ref .",

    "this result might help to understand better how the local electrostatics controls the geometry of the chromatin fiber _ in vitro _ and , on a more tentative level , _ in vivo_. the _ in vitro_-experiments show that chromatin fibers  open up  with decreasing salt concentrations .",

    "however , as mentioned above , for such a large value of @xmath385 the chain - chain repulsion is underestimated by @xmath91120% .    how can the degree of swelling of the chromatin fiber be controlled _ in vivo _ ? under the assumption that the above mentioned geometry is valid the only parameter that might be under biochemical control is the linear charge density @xmath912 .",
    "it is known that the formation of a dense chromatin fiber is dependent on the presence of several components , especially of the cationic linker histones and of some of the lysine - rich ( i.e. , cationic ) n - tails of the core histones that appear to be long , flexible polyelectrolyte chains  @xcite . in fig .",
    "23(b ) i give a tentative picture of the conformation of two n - tails that protrude from the histone core .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as indicated in the figure the tails might form a complex with the entering and exiting linker dna in such a way that they effectively reduce its linear charge density @xmath912 .",
    "it is known that transcriptionally active regions in chromatin show an acetylation of the core histone tails ( i.e. , the cationic groups of the lysines are neutralized ) . in that tentative picture",
    "this acetylation mechanism would increase @xmath912 and according to eq .",
    "[ tan ] this would lead to an opening of the entry - exit angle @xmath15 .",
    "the acetylation might therefore be the first step in the decondensation of a stretch of the chromatin fiber that needs to be accessed for transcription .",
    "let me note that processes that are involved in the acetylation and deacetylation are quite specific and involved as , for instance , discussed in ref .",
    "the histone tail modifications might serve specific functions via the modification of their secondary structure that in turn modifies their interaction with certain proteins @xcite .",
    "recently there are even attempts to decipher a specific language  of covalent histone modifications @xcite",
    ". it might be that such specific processes act in concert with the more basic charge neutralization principle discussed here .",
    "chromatin is of fundamental importance for a host of biological processes ranging from gene expression to cell division .",
    "consequently there is a huge research activity among biologists in this area . for physicists chromatin",
    "becomes now also of interest since there are more and more experiments available that work under quite well - defined conditions .",
    "such experiments typically involve only a few components ( dna , histone proteins ... ) but no active protein `` machines . '' these experiments either focus on elucidating properties of single nucleosomes or of beads - on - a - string complexes ( `` chromatin fibers '' ) .",
    "they study the behavior of these systems under changing ionic conditions and/or under an externally applied tension .",
    "also the dynamics of these systems can be investigated that is solely driven by thermal fluctuations .",
    "theoretical treatments and computer simulations that capture the essential features of the chromatin system are now possible and thus allow to estimate the energy- and time - scales occurring in chromatin .",
    "other approaches look at simplified model systems and try to identify general physical principles that govern complexes of charged chains and macroions . with the better understanding of the mechanical and dynamical properties of nucleosomes and chromatin fibers one hopefully gains also a deeper insight into more complicated questions like the working of chromatin remodeling complexes , the interaction between rna polymerase and nucleosomes etc .    to proceed in this direction it is crucial to obtain reliable numbers from experiments .",
    "one energy scale that dominates many processes is the adsorption energy of dna on the octamer that has now been measured quite directly through stretching experiments .",
    "another important feature  especially in 30-nm fibers  is the nucleosome - nucleosome interaction energy .",
    "again detailed experimental studies have been performed and await a detailed theoretical treatment .",
    "chromatin is a very active and exciting field in biology where tremendous progress has been made in recent years .",
