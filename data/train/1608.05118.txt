    "thanks to new generations of instruments , the past decade of astroparticle physics has been one of dramatic experimental advancement .",
    "the success was in large part due to the scaling of previously proven experimental techniques to achieve orders of magnitude higher sensitivities .",
    "one of the consequences of the scaling is that instruments now use a much larger number of signal channels than before .",
    "a typical astroparticle experiment employs several thousand channels , and the next generation will utilize tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of channels .",
    "the shear increase in the number of channels is a potential challenge when it comes to meeting power and cooling requirements at remote locations , not to mention costs .",
    "mitigating these challenges requires new concepts to digitize signals that not only significantly lower the costs and power per channel , but simultaneously increase the sampling rate and resolution .",
    "the readout concept proposed here has applications in many fields beyond astroparticle physics and is based on fadcs .",
    "flash analog to digital converters ( fadcs ) are a preferred means for signal digitization of any kind .",
    "however , they are costly and consume a non - negligible amount of power ( @xmath3 ) , even when running at modest sampling speeds of a few hundred megasamples per second and 8-bit resolution",
    ". for example the analog device ad 9283 - 100 samples with 100 ms / s at 8bit resolution and consumes 90mw , whereas the ad 9284 samples with 250 ms / s and consumes more than 300mw @xcite .",
    "a good alternative in terms of cost and power that has become prevalent over the past two decades are switched capacitor arrays ( scas ) .",
    "two prominent examples of scas are the target chip @xcite and the domino ring sampler ( drs ) @xcite , which are widely used in astroparticle and high - energy physics experiments @xcite .",
    "the drs4 chip , for example , consumes 17.5mw per channel when sampled at 2gs / s . in an sca based system , unlike in an fadc system , the signal amplitude is not digitized right away .",
    "instead , the analog signal values are stored in an array of capacitors and the stored analog values digitized when a readout command is given .",
    "common disadvantages of scas are limited trace lengths that can be digitized , complicated calibration , and deadtime .",
    "we propose a different approach to digitize signals in future astroparticle experiments , called * * f**ixed * * p**ulse * * s**hape * * e**fficient * * r**eadout ( fipser ) .",
    "fipser is based on the fadc concept , but allows power and costs savings that are similar if not better than in the sca approach .",
    "the major advantage of fipser over sca based systems is the continuous , dead time free digitization of analog signals without having to stop sampling , which opens up new avenues to apply event selection at the detector s trigger level . as a result",
    ", experiments utilizing fipser could potentially see a significant reduction in data volume while increasing the sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "in an fadc system , the input range is discretized into @xmath4 levels , where n - bit is the resolution of the fadc .",
    "for example , an 8-bit system has @xmath5 equally spaced levels .",
    "a typical fadc system is realized with @xmath6 comparators with the threshold of each one being fixed to one of the @xmath6 discrete levels of the fadc .",
    "the signal that needs to be digitized is fed to the input of the comparators , and the digitized output of the fadc is given by the comparator that triggers with the highest set threshold level .",
    "the power consumption and data volume produced by an fadc system is mostly determined by the number of comparators . as such , reducing the amount of comparators results in a significant power saving and smaller data volume .",
    "the number of discriminators can be reduced in applications that do not require equal spacing of the discrete digital levels .",
    "the majority of astroparticle applications fall in this category because for most of them a fine spacing between the levels is necessary for the digitization of small signal amplitudes but a coarse spacing is sufficient for signals with large amplitudes .",
    "this is , for example , true if the recorded signal is subject to poisson fluctuations .",
    "we designed fipser with the requirement to reconstruct a signal below the poisson fluctuation limit and assuming that the shape of the signal is known .",
    "figure  [ fig : block ] shows a conceptual implementation of the fipser for the detection of photon signals from , for example , air showers or cherenkov emission in water . after an amplification stage",
    "the analog signal is split into @xmath7-different branches that each lead to the input of a separate comparator that is set to a unique threshold value .",
    "the output of a comparator is logic high when the input signal is above the comparator s threshold value , and logic low otherwise .",
    "the comparator outputs are connected to an fpga via an optional digital encoder to reduce the number of logic signal lines .",
    "the fpga records the status of the input signals with a fixed sampling rate , and further processes the data before it is recorded on hard disk .",
    "possibilities for online processing of the data with the fpga include signal and time extraction that could be used in advanced trigger algorithm that are executed by the fpga as well .    other applications and implementations than the above discussed",
    "can certainly be thought of .",
    "the objective of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of the fipser concept and not to provide the technical details of a specific implementation .",
    "fipser can be described as being an fadc with varying resolution throughout the dynamic range . as we will show in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , as few as 12 comparators are sufficient to cover a dynamic range of three orders of magnitude with an amplitude resolution that is better than the poisson limit .    in the case",
    "when only one or two discriminator levels are used the proposed system is equivalent to many tdc readout systems that are used in a wide variety of experiments , e.g. @xcite , which is not what we aim at with fipser .",
    "the studied system is better compared to the digitization of signals that are amplified with logarithmic amplifiers or detector signals with intrinsically logarithmic response @xcite .",
    "to quantitatively assess the performance of fipser , we designed a case study reminiscent of typical situations encountered in astroparticle physics .",
    "for example , the chosen configuration could be used to model the digitization of a signal produced by cherenkov - light flashes , such as those detected by the gamma - ray detectors hawc  @xcite and veritas  @xcite , or by the icecube neutrino detector  @xcite . with these applications in mind ,",
    "the statistical nature of the photon generating process sets the following natural upper limit on the required amplitude resolution of the readout system . when @xmath8 is the number of detected photoelectrons , the true number of photoelectrons is in the range @xmath9 , i.e.  the intrinsic relative uncertainty of the detected signal is @xmath10 . from this",
    "it follows that a zero order requirement on the readout system is then to allow the reconstruction of the amplitude / charge of the recorded signal with an uncertainty that is better than @xmath10 , which we adopt as a benchmark that fipser has to meet or outperform . for the dynamic range we chose 1,000 , where aforementioned uncertainty requirement sets the units of amplitude to photoelectrons ( pe ) .",
    "a dynamic range of 1,000 is a typical requirement , and should allow for easy extrapolation to applications with different requirements . in particular , it should be noted that 1,000 is not an upper boundary of the achievable dynamic range .    while the requirement on the resolution of the reconstructed number of photoelectrons applies to the majority of experiments in astroparticle physics , an equally general requirement on the reconstruction of time does not exist .",
    "therefore , we refrain from formulating such a requirement and , instead , present time related quantities relative to the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the signal to be recorded , i.e. the width of the signal sets the unit of time .",
    "this allows for a quick comparison of the simulated fipser performance with individual experimental requirements without having to redo the simulations for specific signal widths .    in the simulations presented here",
    ", we use a lognormal distribution to mimic a pulse shape that is typical for a photomultiplier tube ( pmt )  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\ ] ]    we will use the fwhm as time unit . with this choice , the sampling rate of fipser is given in units of one over the fwhm .",
    "for example , a sampling rate of two means that fipser samples two times per fwhm .    for the configuration of fipser",
    "we define @xmath7 equally logarithmically spaced comparator levels .",
    "the first level is set at 0.25 , and the highest is at 500 .",
    "the @xmath12-th threshold level is given by : @xmath13    our choice of thresholds is arbitrary , and we have not attempted to optimize threshold levels to improve performance . choosing a logarithmic amplifier coupled to an fadc with @xmath7 equally spaced comparator levels will yield the same performance .",
    "a total of four different configurations of fipser are tested , with @xmath14 .",
    "we have investigated these configurations in a single pulse and in a two pulse scenario . in the single pulse case ,",
    "8,000 lognormal pulses had been generated with a random signal amplitude , @xmath15 , between 0.1 and 1,000 .",
    "various levels of white noise was added to the signal by sampling from a normal distribution centered at 0 and varying widths @xmath16 between 0 and 0.8 in units of amplitude .",
    "this range of noise levels is representative for experiments like cta , hawc , icecube , magic , veritas , which we participated in .    in the two pulse case",
    ", we studied 2,000 sets , each set contains two lognormal signal pulses .",
    "both pulses were set to have equal amplitude , while the separation between the two was chosen randomly between 0.25 and 2 fwhm .",
    "white noise was added to the signal with @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pulse_diagrams ] shows example traces of the two types of simulations we have conducted .",
    "the simulated traces are sampled at a given fipser sampling rate and discretized based on the fipser threshold levels .",
    "both leading and trailing edges of the pulse are identified as such .",
    "the simulated data had been reconstructed with two independent techniques .",
    "one technique uses the least - square method with the known signal shape as a fit template .",
    "the second technique is a probabilistic method , essentially a maximum likelihood method , that uses the additional information about the threshold settings of fipser and the characteristics of the noise when reconstructing the signal .",
    "performance was gauged based on how accurately the pulse time and amplitude could be reconstructed .",
    "both methods yield comparable performance in regards to these metrics .",
    "presently , only the least square method allows for the examination of two consecutive pulses to determine their amplitude and separation .",
    "a detailed description of the reconstruction methods is given in the following two sections .",
    "in the least square method the pulse time and amplitude are reconstructed with a @xmath0 inspired test that compares fipser data sets to the known pulse shape with different amplitudes and times .      in the event that a simulated pulse crosses only one comparator , an exact solution exists .",
    "an explicit solution uses less computational time than a minimization . the minimum signal amplitude that can be recorded with fipser is obviously determined by the comparator with the lowest threshold .",
    "in the case when only one comparator fires the duration during which the signal amplitude is above the comparator threshold ( time over threshold , tot ) is used to find the pulse amplitude .",
    "this is done by scaling the template pulse until a match in tot is obtained .",
    "after the tot has been matched the time and the pulse amplitude of the scaled template pulse provide the reconstructed time and amplitude .",
    "if more than one comparator fires a full fit is performed . in the first step of the fit procedure",
    "the limits of the fit parameters are set . the pulse arrival time is constrained to within @xmath18 fwhm and @xmath19 fwhm of the time the first comparator fires .",
    "the limits are based on the fast rising edge of the simulated lognormal signal , and had been fine tuned by hand .",
    "the reconstructed amplitude is constrained to within the highest comparator which triggered , and the comparator level directly above , with 1,000 being used as a maximum in the event that all comparators have triggered .    after establishing the parameter limits , a coarse uniformly sample scan of the parameter space",
    "is performed to determine the initial condition for the minimization . in this step ,",
    "28 possible pulses are compared to the fipser data .",
    "the 28 pulses are combinations of four time values and seven amplitude values that fall within the determined parameter limits .    for fipser , with limited number of comparators , it is plausible for the @xmath20 to be exactly zero . in the case",
    "when the coarse scan returns an already perfect match to the comparator crossings the next steps are skipped and the results from the coarse scan returned as the final result .    to assess the goodness of the match between the test pulse and the fipser data we evaluate @xmath21\\ ] ]    here , @xmath22 is the time when a comparator crossing is registered by fipser , @xmath23 is the total time over threshold , and @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "@xmath24 is also a constant , and is chosen such that it exceeds the largest expected value of the leftmost sub - equation .",
    "equation  [ eqn : modchi ] was conceived to compare pulses which have a different number of comparator crossings .",
    "an important aspect of this equation is that it assumes each upward comparator crossing has an associated downward crossing , i.e. there are no missing trailing edges .    to evaluate equation  [ eqn : modchi ] on a single comparator level ,",
    "we first determine if the level is crossed the same number of times by both the true pulse and the test pulse .",
    "if it is crossed the same number of times , the leftmost sub - equation is used . here ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the times of corresponding comparator crossings . to determine which crossings are to be considered corresponding , we break the level data into two lists containing upward and downward crossings .",
    "the earliest upward crossing in the test data set corresponds to the earliest upward crossing in the true data set , and so forth . performing this over all points and summing produces a numerical value for that level .    in the event",
    "that the level is not crossed the same number of times by the test and true pulses , we use the rightmost sub - equation .",
    "each level will have only one data point , representing the total tot .",
    "the addition of the constant @xmath24 assures that the numerical value for this sub - equation is always larger , and thus less preferable , than in the case where the comparator level is crossed the same number of times .",
    "it is important to note that the tot only relays information about pulse amplitude , and not the time that the pulse occurs . as such ,",
    "this is considered an intermediate step .",
    "when the test and true pulses are sufficiently similar , each comparator will have the same number of crossings , and the preferable leftmost sub equation can be used for the level .",
    "the final step of a succesful reconstruction is a @xmath20 test using the left side term of equation [ eqn : modchi ] .",
    "once this procedure has been followed for all comparator levels , the individual values are summed .",
    "comparing the time over threshold allows equation  [ eqn : modchi ] to be easily applied to multiple pulse waveforms .",
    "for example , while a single pulse waveform can cross a comparator level either twice or not at all ( disregarding noise ) , a waveform composed of two pulses can cross a comparator level twice , four times , or not at all .",
    "once the parameter limits and the first guess have been determined , pyminuit  @xcite is used to minimize equation  [ eqn : modchi ] .",
    "an example of a pulse reconstructed with the least square method is shown in figure  [ fig : single_fitting ] .",
    "the solid curve shows the signal with noise that is digitized with fipser ( circles , placed at the end of the sampling period ) .",
    "the least square method best fit is shown with the sampled data points represented as circles .",
    "the best fitting pulse is shown as a dashed line and the matching fipser threshold crossing times are shown as squares .",
    "the best fit pulse is a good match to the original pulse shape .",
    "the differences can be attributed to fluctuations caused by noise .    while this reconstruction method works well with a noise level of @xmath17 , a fraction of the data",
    "can not be successfully be reconstructed at higher noise levels .",
    "the failure rates are modest , so we have developed criteria to remove failed reconstructions .",
    "a reconstruction is considered failed with the following characteristics : an amplitude greater than 60 units , an amplitude less than 2 amplitude units below a comparator or 1000 amplitude units , and a modified @xmath0 above a predetermined value .",
    "only a single reconstruction out of 8000 failed for noise level of @xmath17 or lower . with noise levels of @xmath27 , 0.38% , 2.68% , 4.72% , and 5.40% of 8000 reconstructions fail .",
    "we do not apply this criteria for double pulse reconstructions .",
    "all single pulse figures presented here exclude data for failed reconstructions .",
    "the procedure for analyzing two pulses is nearly identical to that of reconstructing a single pulse , with the only differences being how the parameter limits and the initial guess is being determined .",
    "the procedure requires the user to specify that two pulses should be reconstructed , and does not currently contain the logic to autonomously determine the number of pulses to be fit .",
    "the arrival time of the first pulse is constrained to be between @xmath18 and @xmath19 fwhm of the time when fipser registers that the first comparator has triggered .",
    "the time of the second pulse is constrained to be between the time the first pulse triggers and the time the signal drops again below the lowest threshold . but has a maximum of 5 fwhm separation .",
    "the amplitude of both pulses is constrained to be between 0.25 and the comparator with the next highest level that has not triggered , or 1,000 if all comparators have triggered .",
    "it is not a priori assumed that both pulses have the same amplitude .",
    "the number of test pulses in the coarse scan is allowed to vary .",
    "the arrival time of the first pulse is fixed to be half of @xmath28 before the first comparator triggered .",
    "the arrival time of the second pulse is varied with a minimum spacing of @xmath29 fwhm between the first and last comparator triggered by a charging signal , with a maximum scan range of 5 fwhm .",
    "both pulse amplitudes are scanned uniformly with 7 different values between 0 and their maximum boundary condition , and are not assumed to be the same .",
    "in our second method to extract signal time and amplitude , we maximize the probability that the discretized values can be described with a known signal shape @xmath30 , an unknown time @xmath31 , and amplitude @xmath15 .",
    "the method takes uncorrelated and white noise into account with a known amplitude distribution @xmath32 .",
    "here is an example how to calculate the probability that a discretized pulse shape is due to a pulse with amplitude @xmath33 and time @xmath34 .",
    "lets consider the time @xmath31 when a discriminator fires for the first time . for that time",
    "the probability @xmath35 to observe a noise amplitude @xmath36 can be expressed as    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the level of the discriminator with the highest threshold level that fired at time @xmath31 and @xmath39 is the next highest threshold of the discriminator that did not fire .",
    "the above equation only considers the situation at time @xmath31 and all the following time samples have also to be included in order to calculate a combined probability .",
    "@xmath40 is drawn from the noise distribution of amplitudes and it is assumed that the noise between fipser samples is uncorrelated .",
    "it thus follows that the combined probability @xmath41 for an assumed @xmath33 and @xmath42 is the product of all the @xmath40,_i.e . _    @xmath43    where @xmath44 runs over all the @xmath7 fipser samples during which at least one discriminator fired .    to properly normalize the probability q(@xmath45 )",
    "we need to integrate @xmath41 over all possible amplitudes @xmath15 and times @xmath22",
    ". may the allowed range for @xmath22 over which @xmath41 is integrated be between @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the allowed range for the signal amplitudes be between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "guidance on how to chose values for these limits is given later .",
    "the normalization is then @xmath50 in order to arrive at the amplitude and time of the discretized signal we chose to use the expected values @xmath51 and @xmath52      the description of the fit method is complete and its performance depends on the ability to calculate the above integrals fast and with high enough precision . in the following",
    "we share some of our experience optimizing precision and computation time .",
    "[ [ optimizing - integration ] ] optimizing integration + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when the sample period @xmath53 is sufficiently small and the number of thresholds @xmath8 large enough , the integral in ( [ 2 ] ) is close to zero whenever @xmath34 and @xmath54 are not very close to a reasonable initial time and amplitude pair .",
    "this is due to the fact that faster sampling and more thresholds yield more precise reconstructed pulses , and thus the vast majority of the allowed parameter space @xmath55\\times [ a_m , a_m]$ ] contribute little to the total integral . in other words , the biggest contributors to the integral are a small number of time and amplitude pairs .",
    "for this reason , standard quadrature methods , unless very heavily subdivided , perform poorly .",
    "this may be remedied by reducing the integration space to one which includes a much larger density of reasonable amplitudes and times .",
    "one method to find _ dense _ regions in the parameter space is to firstly maximize equation [ 2 ] as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath54 .",
    "then , the user may integrate a small area around that maximum .",
    "however , caution needs to be exercised because the parameter space might have several local maxima , which can cause the maximization method to fail finding the global maximum .",
    "the log - normal signal as parametrized by the initial time and amplitude is given by equation  [ eqn : lognormal ] .",
    "for this pulse shape we chose limits on the initial time of @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the motivation for setting the lower limit at minus two times the fwhm of the signal instead of choosing 0 is that it allows for sufficient time to consider whether discriminators firing due to noise are part of the signal or not .",
    "setting @xmath58 reaches its maximum when @xmath59 , and thus @xmath57 is slightly greater than the peak time and for the vast majority of signal arrivals at least one discriminator will have fired by @xmath60 .",
    "+ the amplitude limits will simply be @xmath61 and @xmath62 in this study . in principal",
    "this range can be narrowed for each case to be roughly in between the highest discriminator level that fired and the next highest that did not fire .",
    "the exact range has to be larger than that because the discriminator is fired by the sum of the signal and noise .    for the probability distribution of noise",
    "we assume a normal distribution @xmath63 with @xmath64=0.1",
    ".    in our simulation studies we use an iterated gauss - kronrod numerical integration method with 20 linear steps in time and 30 steps with respect to the square root of the amplitude achieved a reconstructed amplitude and initial time pair .",
    "we found that the probabilistic method performs slightly better than the least square method in the reconstruction of single pulses .",
    "however , the probabilistic method was not tested on the reconstruction of the two pulse scenario , which is why we only show results produced with the least square methods to be consistent throughout the paper .",
    "the accuracy of reconstructing the signal amplitude is judged by evaluating the relative amplitude residuals @xmath65 between the reconstructed amplitude @xmath66 and the true amplitude of the signal @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig:8_20_amp ] shows two example scatter plots of the residuals as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "results for a fipser configuration with 8 comparators is shown on the left , and for a configuration with 20 comparators on the right .",
    "the poisson limit , as defined in section  [ sec : config ] , is indicated by curved dashed lines , and is satisfied if @xmath68 of all events fall within these bounds .",
    "an analysis of these specific results shows that a fipser configuration with 8 comparators does not meet the poisson limit requirement for pulse amplitudes greater than 100 , while pulse amplitudes up to 600 can be reconstructed within the poisson limit fall if 20 comparators are used .",
    "both simulations had been performed with a sampling rate of 4 samples per fwhm and with white noise of @xmath69 , which is typical for noise that is introduced in the signal chain and is not due to detector signals .        to allow for a direct comparison between different fipser configurations and the poisson limit , the scatter plots are re - binned in true amplitude , and the mean and root mean square ( rms ) of the residuals are calculated for each bin .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ fig : single_amp ] shows the rms values vs. true amplitude for configurations with 8 , 12 , 16 , and 20 comparators , which includes the configuration already shown in figure  [ fig:8_20_amp ] .",
    "all of these simulations had been performed with a sampling rate of 4 samples per fwhm and a white noise level of @xmath69 .",
    "as expected , the amplitude resolution improves with more comparators . for the configurations with 12 and 20 comparators",
    ", the amplitude resolution meets the poisson limit requirement up to an amplitude of @xmath70500 .",
    "we note that the configuration with 16 comparators produces worse results than with 12 comparators at amplitudes greater than 10 .",
    "this feature is present in both the least square and probabilistic reconstruction methods .",
    "we believe this is a result of a less - than - ideal spacing of the comparator levels , and hypothesize that distributing the levels in a different way would remedy this . however , we chose to leave this as an avenue for a future study .",
    "a dominant feature visible in figure  [ fig:8_20_amp ] is the banded structure in the scatter plots .",
    "this is due to the finite sampling rates , which cause pulses in specific amplitude ranges to of have identical thresholds crossing times in fipser . as such",
    ", the minimizer used in the least square method only returns a set of discrete reconstructed amplitudes .",
    "the probabilistic reconstruction method is free of these artifacts .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : single_amp ] shows how charge resolution varies with sampling speed .",
    "the resolution does not improve with sampling rates higher than 4 samples per fwhm .",
    "figure  [ fig:8_20_amp ] and figure  [ fig : single_amp ] combined show that it is more efficient to improve the amplitude resolution of fipser by increasing the number of comparators , as opposed to increasing the sampling rate .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise ] shows the performance of fipser at varying noise levels while utilizing 12 comparators at a sampling rate of 4 samples per fwhm .",
    "the rms of the noise is varied between 0 and 0.8 amplitude units , with the latter being a worst case scenario for most applications in particle astrophysics .",
    "the poisson limit requirement for the amplitude resolution is met for most of the dynamic range . only for signal amplitudes above 40 is the amplitude resolution worse than the poisson limit when noise levels are higher than 0.4  @xmath16 .",
    "the ability of fipser to accurately determine the timing of a pulse is qualitatively assessed by calculating the difference between the true time and the reconstructed time .",
    "figure  [ fig:8_20_time ] shows scatter plots of the time residuals for the same fipser configurations as in figure  [ fig:8_20_amp ] . as before ,",
    "we divide the scatter plots into bins of true amplitude and calculate the mean and root mean square ( rms ) of the time differences .",
    "these results , along with two additional fipser configurations , are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : single_time ] .",
    "it can be seen in the right panel of figure [ fig:8_20_amp ] that 12 comparators achieve a significant improvement in time resolution than using a configuration with 8 comparators , particularly above amplitudes of 1 .",
    "the time resolution improves dramatically from 0.03 fwhm for a configuration with 8 comparators to 0.01 fwhm for a configuration with 20 comparators for large signal amplitudes .",
    "we note that for a detector signal with a fwhm of 10ns , these values translate into time resolutions of 300ps and 100ps , respectively .",
    "the sampling rate of 4 per fwhm equates to a moderate 400 megasamples per second . for comparison ,",
    "pmt signals in icecube are digitized at 333 megasamples per second .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : single_time ] shows how the time resolution improves with increasing sampling rate for a configuration with 12 comparators . at larger amplitudes",
    "the resolution remains relatively constant .",
    "the same conclusion we found when studying the amplitude resolution also applies to the time resolution , it seems more practical to choose a configuration with more comparators and a moderate sampling rate instead of increasing the sampling rate while keeping a smaller number of comparators .",
    "the performance of fipser for the reconstruction of two pulses per trace can be evaluated by looking at the amplitude resolution of the first pulse , the second pulse , and the aggregate waveform . because only two of them are independent it is sufficient to analyze the amplitude resolution of the first pulse and the aggregate waveform . in our studies we found that the performance of reconstructing two pulses is relatively uniform for signals with amplitudes above 1 , _",
    "i.e. _ for signals that fire several comparators .",
    "we , therefore , fixed the amplitude of both the first and second pulse to 10 and tested the reconstruction performance as a function of the distance between the first and second pulse .",
    "figure  [ fig : fa ] shows the amplitude resolution of the first reconstructed pulse as a function of pulse separation .",
    "the amplitude resolution slightly improves with increasing number of comparators and increasing sampling rates .",
    "interestingly it is the configuration with 8 comparators that now appears to be worse than one would expect from the resolutions obtained with the other configurations .",
    "if the origin of the worse resolution is the same as in the single pulse case a different spacing of the comparator levels might yield a better resolution for the 8 comparator case .",
    "in fact , for the given fixed pulse amplitude of 10 the fipser configurations with 12 , 16 , and 20 comparators all have a comparator level close to the peak of the combined amplitude of the two peaks , which is not the case in the configuration with 8 comparators .",
    "figure  [ fig : tc ] demonstrates how the charge resolution of the two pulses combined varies for different sampling rates and number of comparators .",
    "overall , the resolution is fairly consistent , and does not show any obvious trends over the range of sampling rates , number of comparators , or pulse separations which were tested .",
    "particles of an air shower arrive at different times . in particular , muons precede electromagnetic components . the ability to resolve consecutive pulses may aid in the detection of muons in detectors such as hawc . for the analysis of the achievable time resolution in the two pulse case we evaluated the resolution of the time of the first pulse and the time resolution of the separation between the two .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : ps ] , the determination of the pulse separation improves only slightly with pulse separation once the pulse separation is more than @xmath71fwhm .",
    "some improvement in resolution is seen when the sampling rate increases from 3 to 4 samples per fwhm .",
    "we performed conceptual studies of fipser , a readout concept , which promises to achieve significant power savings compared to fadc based readout systems .",
    "the results of two independent reconstruction methods show that 12 comparators at a moderate sampling rate of 4 samples per signal fwhm can meet the @xmath72 requirements over a dynamic range of three orders of magnitude . a time resolution significantly better than 1ns seems possible for pulses with a fwhm of less than 10ns .",
    "the same conclusions can be drawn when the trace is composed of two partially overlapping pulses .",
    "a limitation of the fipser concept is that the pulse shape needs to be known beforehand .",
    "while this should not pose a problem for most applications in astroparticle physics , the concept needs to be studied in greater detail for applications in which pulses of similar amplitudes can overlap frequently and the pulse shape can not be assumed fixed .",
    "more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms could mitigate some of these limitations .    compared to established readout schemes",
    ", fipser provides a number of practical advantages . due to a decrease in the number of comparators by an order of magnitude",
    ", fipser has the potential to realize significant power savings when compared to existing readout systems .",
    "other positive features are compactness of a fipser readout and a possible reduction in data volumes .",
    "fipser is dead time free , and it is straightforward to implement online event selection and processing .",
    "the implementation of a prototype of fipser is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a possibility for implementing the concept is to use fpgas @xcite , which have developed into one of the most versatile tools for data acquisition systems in recent years .",
