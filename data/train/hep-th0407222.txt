    "the one - loop effective action plays a central role in quantum field theory . for a specific background field it represents quantum effects of direct physical relevance ( e.g. , the induced vacuum energy in the given background ) , while for general background fields it corresponds to the proper - vertex generating functional of the theory .",
    "the ultraviolet divergence or renormalization problem for the one - loop effective action is well - understood , but it is notoriously difficult to evaluate explicitly its full finite part in the presence of a given nontrivial background . for nonabelian theories in three spatial dimensions ,",
    "there are essentially only two types of exact calculations for this _ full _ amplitude  the heisenberg - euler - type nonlinear action describing vacuum polarization and pair creation effects in the background of ( covariantly ) constant gauge field strengths @xcite , and the qcd one - loop effective action for massless quarks in a self - dual yang - mills background field ( describing instantons ) @xcite .    to study instanton - related physics it is of fundamental importance to determine the one - loop tunnelling amplitude given by the euclidean one - loop effective action in the background of a single ( anti-)instanton @xcite .",
    "t hooft @xcite succeeded in calculating the corresponding contribution by massless scalar or quark fields exactly in the 1970s , but such an exact calculation is no longer possible if the fields have non - zero mass . for various phenomenological applications @xcite ( and also for the extrapolation of lattice results @xcite , obtained at unphysically large quark masses , to lower physical masses ) , it is important to have more definite information about the contributions due to quarks of not - so - small mass . in this work , we will describe our approach to this problem and present explicit numerical results .",
    "previously , two of us ( with kwon ) @xcite studied the corresponding one - loop effective action with arbitrary mass , using a smooth interpolation between the results obtained in the large and small mass limits .",
    "the expression in the large mass limit is naturally obtained from the schwinger - dewitt expansion @xcite ( or the heat - kernel expansion ) within the proper - time representation of the effective action , while the result in the small mass limit follows from the works of t hooft @xcite , carlitz and creamer @xcite , and kwon et al .",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use a systematic approximation for any quark mass  the effective action for any mass is calculated approximately without invoking an ad hoc interpolation procedure .",
    "the basic strategy is as follows .",
    "we use the proper - time representation of the effective action , which requires the explicit functional form of @xmath0 the instanton background enters through the covariant derivative @xmath1 in @xmath2 , and this function @xmath3 can be expressed in terms of scattering phase shifts @xcite for the partial - wave quadratic differential operators related to @xmath4 .",
    "we evaluate these phase shifts in the quantum - mechanical wkb approximation , extended to the third - order correction terms @xcite to ensure the correct small-@xmath5 behavior for @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to a numerical expression for @xmath3 , which in turn yields the effective action for arbitrary mass value .",
    "the resulting mass dependence is fully consistent with the conjecture made by kwon et al @xcite , on the basis of the explicitly known results at the opposite ends .",
    "our partial - wave wkb phase - shift method should provide a practical approximation scheme for the one - loop effective action in a broad class of background fields . in this approach",
    ", @xmath3 generally takes a _ local _ form in the potentials and their derivatives",
    " see ( [ local ] ) below . in the light of this observation",
    ", we conclude this paper by comparing to another method , the derivative expansion , which produces such local expressions .",
    "surprisingly , the leading order of the derivative expansion provides a remarkably good approximation for general values of the quark mass .",
    "due to a hidden supersymmetry of the system with a quark in a background instanton field , the one - loop effective action of a dirac spinor field of mass @xmath6 ( and isospin @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 , can be related to the corresponding scalar effective action ( for a complex scalar of mass @xmath6 and isospin @xmath7 ) by @xcite @xmath9 the first contribution corresponds to the existence of a zero eigenvalue in the spectrum of the dirac operator for a single instanton background .",
    "this relationship ( which is special to a self - dual background ) has the important consequence that it is sufficient to consider the scalar effective action @xmath10 to learn also about the corresponding fermion effective @xmath8 , for any mass value m.    we consider an su(2 ) single instanton background @xcite @xmath11 the regularized one - loop scalar effective action has the proper - time representation @xmath12 where @xmath2 with @xmath13",

    "we need a more general expression for @xmath3 . in the small mass limit , on the other hand , a completely independent calculation for @xmath20 has been given @xcite , based on the fact that the massless propagators in an instanton background are known in closed - form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is euler s constant . from this small @xmath6 behavior it is possible to infer that @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "however , this information does not determine the magnitude of @xmath20 even for small @xmath6 , since the integral in ( [ ptaction ] ) is dominated by contributions from non - asymptotic @xmath5-values .    in this paper",
    "we make use of the fact that the function @xmath3 may be expressed in terms of appropriate scattering phase shifts .",

    "this follows from the nature of the scattering problem as defined by ( [ insth ] ) and ( [ freeh ] ) ; according to the forms for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , their small-@xmath49 behaviors match for a given @xmath69-value , but it is the @xmath70-value that governs the large-@xmath49 behavior of the effective potential in @xmath73 , and @xmath70 does not appear in @xmath74 .",
    "this apparent mis - match can be resolved simply by considering the phase shifts @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( with the same associated degeneracy factor ) together as a package . with this understanding , the expression ( [ fexpression ] ) can now be cast in the form @xmath77 this form still requires careful treatment with regards to the @xmath69-sum and @xmath68-integration .",
    "we will argue below that the correct ( gauge - invariant ) procedure is to have the various terms corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue ( i.e. , the same @xmath78-value ) receive uniform consideration . as a convenient check on this procedure , we confirm that the predicted small-@xmath5 behavior reproduces the form in ( [ smalls ] ) .",
    "to find the exact form of @xmath3 with the help of ( [ ffinal ] ) , one must first have complete knowledge of the scattering phase shifts @xmath79 , and then carry out the needed infinite sum / integration in a carefully controlled way .",
    "this is not possible in general , and therefore one needs to develop a reliable approximation scheme to determine the function @xmath3 .",
    "we provide such a scheme below , which relies on a systematic wkb approximation for the scattering phase shifts in question .",
    "in contrast to previous applications @xcite of the wkb method for a similar purpose ( but in lower dimensions ) , the leading - order wkb result turns out to be insufficient even to ensure the correct value for @xmath80 .",
    "[ recall that from ( [ smalls ] ) we must have @xmath81 in order to construct the renormalized effective action as in ( [ renaction ] ) ] .",
    "the necessity to include higher - order wkb contributions arises from the inaccuracy of the @xmath69-sum in ( [ ffinal ] ) with respect to large-@xmath69 contributions .",
    "while the degree of accuracy of the wkb expression for the phase shifts is generally enhanced for higher partial waves , the large degeneracy factor @xmath82 has the consequence that leading - order wkb method is insufficient .",
    "fortunately , as we shall see below , this can be remedied in a systematic way by including higher - order wkb correction terms .",
    "let us first consider the representation of @xmath3 in the leading wkb approximation . to that end , ( [ insth ] ) may be rewritten as an equation for @xmath83 : @xmath84 for this one - dimensional schrdinger - type equation , the leading wkb solution can be given immediately , including the usual langer correction @xcite to take into account the singular centrifugal term .",
