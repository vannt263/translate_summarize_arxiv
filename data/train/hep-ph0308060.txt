    "most supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) based on some soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking mechanism contain several cp phases , whose large values tend to render lepton and quark electric dipole moments ( edm ) too large to satisfy stringent experimental constraints @xcite . such cp crises",
    "are generic in supersymmetric theories , but may be resolved by pushing the masses of some sparticles , especially the first and second generation sfermions , above a few tev , by arranging for internal cancellations , or by simply setting phases to be extremely small @xcite . on the other hand , new sources of cp violation beyond the sm are required to explain the non  zero baryon asymmetry in the universe in the standard big bang framework @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to look for new signatures for cp violation in such susy scenarios with some large phases , as long as they are consistent with the stringent edm and other low  energy constraints . in this light , detailed analyses of the neutralino sector at future @xmath0 linear collider experiments @xcite can prove particularly fruitful @xcite , because in most supersymmetric theories neutralinos belong to the class of the lighter supersymmetric particles @xcite and the neutralino system contains two non  trivial cp violating phases .",
    "+    there are many different ways for probing cp violation in the neutralino system .",
    "the imaginary parts of the complex parameters in the neutralino mass matrix could most directly and unambiguously be determined by measuring suitable cp violating observables by exploiting initial beam polarization and angular correlations between neutralino production and decay at future high  energy colliders @xcite .",
    "but , their experimental measurements will be quite difficult",
    ". the presence of the cp violating phases can also be identified through by their impact on cp  even quantities such as neutralino masses , branching ratios and so on . however , since these quantities are already non  zero in the cp conserving case , the detection of the presence of non  trivial cp phases will require a careful quantitative analysis of a number of physical observables , especially for small cp ",
    "odd phases giving rise to very small deviations from the cp  conserving values @xcite . on the other hand , the rise of excitation curves near threshold for non  diagonal neutralino pair production in @xmath0 collision is altered qualitatively in cp ",
    "noninvariant theories @xcite , by allowing the steep s  wave increase of all pairs simultaneously .",
    "thus , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , precise measurements of the threshold behavior of the non  diagonal neutralino pair production processes may give clear indications of non  zero cp violating phases in the neutralino sector , if at least three different neutralino states are accessible kinematically .",
    "+    in the present note we provide a new powerful method for probing cp violation in the neutralino system , which is based on a combined analysis of the threshold excitations of neutralino pair production in @xmath0 annihilation and the fermion invariant mass distribution near the end point of the 3body neutralino fermionic decays : @xmath6 [ the 3body decay process includes clean @xmath7 and @xmath0 decay channels with little background , which allow a clear reconstruction of the kinematical configuration with good precision . ]",
    "this method relies on selection rules , unique to the neutralino system due to its majorana nature in cp ",
    "invariant theories , and it can work effectively if the branching ratios of the 3body neutralino fermionic decays are not suppressed .",
    "[ once two  body decays of the neutralino @xmath8 into @xmath9 , higgs bosons or sfermions are open , the new method is ineffective . ] +    before demonstrating the new method for probing cp violation in the neutralino system in detail , we describe briefly the mixing for the neutral gauginos and higgsinos in cp  noninvariant theories with non  vanishing phases in sec .",

    "the lepton or quark invariant mass distribution of the decay @xmath10 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) decreases slowly in p  waves ( steeply in s  waves ) near the end point .",
    "thus , the observation of simultaneous sharp s  wave excitations of both the production of any non  diagonal neutralino pair @xmath11 near threshold and the fermion invariant mass distribution of the decay @xmath10 near the end point will be a qualitative , unambiguous evidence for cp violation in the neutralino system .",

    "the combined analysis of the threshold excitation of the production process , @xmath92 , and the fermion invariant mass distribution of the decay , @xmath93 , near the end point can still serve as one of the most powerful probes of cp violation in the neutralino system even in the initial phase of @xmath0 linear colliders .",
