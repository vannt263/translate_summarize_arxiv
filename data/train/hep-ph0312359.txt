    "the electroproduction of large-@xmath0 hadrons which is observed by the hera experiments h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite may provide important tests of qcd .",
    "in addition to the study of the partonic subprocesses , of the parton distributions in the proton and of the fragmentation functions , it also offers the possibility to observe the virtual photon structure function . a contribution of the latter is indeed expected when the hadron transverse energy squared @xmath8 is much larger than the photon virtuality @xmath9  ; in this case the virtual photon structure function contribution , proportional to @xmath10 , can be important .",
    "another interest of this reaction is the study of the production mechanisms of forward hadrons .",
    "indeed , the forward region can be associated with bfkl dynamics and provide tests of the latter @xcite .",
    "several papers have studied the production of large-@xmath0 jets @xcite and hadrons @xcite in the forward direction , and have concluded that these reactions are relevant for the study of bfkl dynamics .",
    "however , results from h1 @xcite show that theoretical predictions based on the dglap dynamics , implemented in rapgap @xcite or based on bfkl dynamics @xcite are both in agreement with data .",
    "these theoretical results do not necessarily contradict each other , since the same feynman graphs may contribute to both of them .",
    "but it is clear that a deeper understanding of the underlying forward dynamics requires quantitative predictions , which are not fully realized in the existing literature above .",
    "@xcite which implements the dglap dynamics rests on a leading order ( lo ) approximation and suffers from scale dependence which forbids an absolute normalization .",
    "@xcite takes into account some higher order ( ho ) corrections to the lo bfkl equation , but does not include non - bfkl contributions .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the ho corrections to the born subprocesses associated with the electroproduction of large-@xmath0 hadrons namely the qcd compton process @xmath11 and the fusion process @xmath12 .",
    "the born subprocess cross sections , of order @xmath13 , and the ho subprocess cross sections , of order @xmath14 , are convoluted with parton distributions and fragmentation functions calculated at the nlo approximation .",
    "the total nlo cross - section ( born + ho contributions ) is sensitive to the choice of the renormalization and factorization scales , but there is a compensation between the variations of the born and ho contributions in such a way that the nlo cross section is more stable than the lo ( containing only the born terms ) cross sections .",
    "the work presented here is a fixed order ( for the subprocess cross section ) , nlo calculation , the dglap dynamics being included by the scale dependent distributions and fragmentation functions .",
    "however , among the ho contributions , one of them corresponds to the lowest order bfkl cross section , namely , the reaction @xmath15 . as this contribution is part of an ho calculation",
    ", we have a way to establish a link between the normalization of our nlo cross section and that of the ( lowest order ) bfkl cross section .",
    "as mentioned in the beginning of this section , the ho calculation generates a contribution proportional to the virtual photon structure function . at order @xmath14",
    "we obtain the born expression of this structure function , proportional to @xmath16 and we shall study how important this contribution to the large-@xmath0 forward hadron cross section is in the h1 kinematical configuration .",
    "all order contributions to the virtual photon structure function can be resummed using an inhomogeneous dglap evolution equation . here",
    "we shall briefly discuss this possibility , leaving for another publication @xcite a detailed analysis of the resummed virtual photon structure function .    as a final point concerning the nature of this calculation ,",
    "let us emphasize the fact that it describes the production of large-@xmath0 hadrons in the virtual - photon proton centre - of - mass system ( cms ) and that it is also valid in the limit @xmath17 , the large scale then being provided by @xmath8 .",
    "it must be compared with experimental results which impose a lower bound on the final hadron @xmath0 in the @xmath18 cms , as is done by the h1 and zeus collaboration @xcite .",
    "therefore the present work does not consider the target fragmentation mechanism , which requires the introduction of fracture functions @xcite .",
    "it is also different from the inclusive calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite in that it is an exclusive nlo partonic generator .",
    "this allows us to calculate various types of correlations ( for example between large-@xmath0 hadron and jets ) and facilitates the implementation of experimental cuts .    in the next section",
    "we shall present an overview of the relevant dis kinematics and of the method used to calculate the ho corrections .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the virtual photon structure function and , in section 4 , we compare our theoretical results with h1 data @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss in detail the importance of the virtual photon contribution and of the bfkl - like contribution in the h1 kinematical region .",
    "section 5 studies the production of large-@xmath0 hadrons in the central region in rapidity .",
    "section 6 is the conclusion .",
    "the kinematics of the reaction @xmath19 is fixed by the observation , in the laboratory frame , of the outgoing lepton and hadron @xmath20 momenta @xcite .",
    "we define the photon variables ( axis @xmath21 along the initial proton momentum )    [ 1e ] & & q^2 = - q^2 = - ( - )^2 + & & y = q^0 - q^z ^0 - ^z = p",
    "q p = q^2 s  1 x_bj ,    where we have neglected the proton mass and used the notation @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the outgoing hadron is defined by its transverse energy @xmath24 and its pseudo rapidity @xmath25 .",
    "the inclusive cross section is written in terms of the leptonic tensor ( summed and averaged over the spins of the leptons )    [ 2e ] ^ = 2 ( ^ ^ + ^ ^ - g^ (  - m_e^2 ) ) ,    and the hadronic tensor @xmath26 which describes the photon - proton collision    [ 3e ] dddq^2 dy = 2  1 2s  ^ t _ q^4 dps ,    where    @xmath27    is the final state hadron phase space element and @xmath28 the photon azimuthal angle .",
    "( a sum over the number of final hadrons is understood in ( [ 3e ] ) ) .",
    "the hadronic tensor can be calculated as a convolution between the partonic tensor @xmath29 which describes the interaction between the virtual photon and the parton of the proton , and the parton distribution in the proton @xmath30 .",
    "the fragmentation of the final parton which produces a large-@xmath0 hadron is described by the fragmentation function @xmath31 .",
    "these distributions depend on the factorization scales @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,    [ 4e ] t _ dps = _ a , b g_a(x , m ) dz  d_b^h(z , m_f ) t_^ab dps ,    where @xmath34 is the phase space element of the partons produced in the hard photon - parton collision . from expressions ( [ 3e ] ) and ( [ 4e ] ) , we obtain    [ 5e ] & & dddq^2 dyde_4^lab d_4^lab = e_4^lab 2 2 _ a , b dx g_a(x , m ) d_b^h(z , m_f ) + & & dps ,    where the phase space @xmath35 no longer contains parton 4 which fragments into @xmath36 . up to this point",
    "we have been writing @xmath24 and @xmath25 to emphasize the frame in which the reaction is observed .",
    "of course ( [ 5e ] ) is valid in any frame and from now on we shall drop the index `` lab '' .    the tensor product is a series in @xmath37 . taking into account the first and second order contributions , we rewrite ( [ 5e ] ) as    [ 6e ] & & dddq^2 dy de_4 d_4 = 2 _ a , b dx g_a(x , m ) d_b^h(z , m_f ) + & & \\ { _ s ( ) 2 + ( _ s ( ) 2 ) ^2 }  .    the cross sections @xmath38 are the subprocess born cross sections which describe the electroproduction of a large-@xmath0 parton @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the associated higher order corrections .",
    "figure 1a shows the born term corresponding to the qcd compton ( qcdc ) process ( here partons @xmath41 and @xmath39 are quarks ) .",
    "when @xmath41 is a gluon , we have the so called photon - gluon fusion born term .",
    "examples of a graph contributing to ho corrections to the qcdc term are shown in fig .",

    "this is not true if an initial collinearity is present in the partonic tensor ( light partons are massless ) which leads to the behavior @xmath57 .",
    "this point will be discussed in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "after these kinematical preliminaries , let us describe the calculation of the ho corrections which uses the phase - space slicing method elaborated in ref .",
    "we outline the strategy only briefly ; for more details we refer to @xcite .    for a generic reaction @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , at least two particles of the final state , say 3 and 4 , have a high @xmath0 and are well separated in phase space , while the last one , say 5 , can be soft , and/or collinear to any of the four others .",
    "of course on the photon side there is no collinear divergence as long as @xmath59 is different from zero .",
    "this part of the calculation is related to the virtual photon structure function to be discussed below . in order to extract the other singularities ,",
    "the phase space is cut into two regions  :    \\(1 ) part i where the norm @xmath60 of the transverse momentum of particle 5 is required to be less than some arbitrary value @xmath61 taken to be small compared to the other transverse momenta .",
    "this cylinder contains the infrared and the initial state collinear singularities .",
    "it also contains a small fraction of the final state collinear singularities .",
    "\\(2 ) parts",
    "iia(b ) where the transverse momentum vector of particle 5 is required to have a norm larger than @xmath62 , and to belong to a cone @xmath63 about the direction of particle 3(4 ) , defined by @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , with @xmath66 some small arbitrary number . @xmath63",
    "contains the final state collinear singularities appearing when 5 is collinear to 3(4 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) part iic where @xmath60 is required to have a norm larger than @xmath62 , and to belong to neither of the two cones @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "this slice yields no divergence , and can thus be treated directly in 4 dimensions . for this regular part of the calculations we use the cross sections from @xcite .    the contributions from regions i and iia , b are calculated analytically in @xmath69 dimensions and then combined with the corresponding virtual corrections ( borrowed from disent @xcite ) such that the infrared singularities cancel each other , leaving only the initial ( final ) state collinear singularities , which are factorized and absorbed into the parton distribution ( fragmentation ) functions .",
    "the @xmath70 factorization and renormalization schemes are used in this calculation .    after the cancellation , the finite remainders of the soft and collinear contributions in parts i and iia , b , c separately depend on large logarithms @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . when combining the different parts , the cancellations of the @xmath62 and @xmath66 dependent terms occur .",
    "actually , in part i , the finite terms are approximated by collecting all the terms depending logarithmically on @xmath62 and neglecting the terms proportional to powers of @xmath62 .",
    "similarly in parts iia and iib we keep only the logarithmic terms @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the parameter @xmath62 must be chosen small enough with respect to @xmath75 so that the neglected terms can be safely dropped .",
    "on the other hand , it can not be chosen too small for then numerical instabilities may occur .",
    "similar remarks are also valid for the @xmath66 cut - off .",
    "this approach allows us to build a partonic event generation which is very flexible  ; various sorts of observables and experimental cuts being easily handled .",
    "more references to this method , which has been used to calculate nlo correction to several photoproduction and hadroproduction reactions can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the calculation of the ho corrections leads to a contribution proportional to @xmath76 ( when @xmath77 ) , the so - called resolved photon contribution .",
    "indeed , let us consider the contribution associated with fig .",
    "1b in which we interchange the label 5 and 4 .",
    "the integration over @xmath60 ( the unobserved final quark momentum ) produces , among other contributions , a logarithm contribution @xmath76 associated with a configuration in which the final quark is collinear to the virtual photon .",
    "more explicitly , we obtain the following expression ( for a transversely polarized photon )    [ 10e ] _ & = & 2 dz \\ { _",
    "0^e_4 ^ 2 dk_^2 k_^2-q^2z(1-z ) .",

    "the cross section of the @xmath80 subprocess is calculated with @xmath81 on - shell ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath34 is the final partonic phase space of parton 3 and 4 .",
    "this expression , as well as a similar one for the scalar cross section , will be derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "a discussion of the second term of ( [ 10e ] ) ( the non - logarithmic piece ) is also postponed to this paper .",
    "here we are interested in the term proportional to @xmath83 and in a discussion of the upper limit of the integral in ( [ 10e ] ) .    from ( [ 10e ] )",

    ", the quark distribution is calculated with no qcd correction .",
    "however when @xmath85 it becomes important to calculate these corrections and to replace ( [ 12e ] ) by the lo or nlo expressions of the quark distribution @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are only interested in the study of the importance of the resolved contribution obtained in the kinematical configuration of the h1 experiment and we content ourselves with the lowest order expression ( [ 12e ] ) . however this expression , obtained in the limit @xmath85 ,",
    "must be elaborated in order to cover other kinematical configurations as well .",
    "when @xmath86 , we can not neglect the @xmath87 dependence of @xmath88 which suppresses the logarithmic integration in expression ( [ 10e ] ) . the resolved contribution coming from the collinear configuration",
    "can be approximated by the form    [ neweq ] _ dz",
    "p_q(z )  ( 0 )  dps ,    which has the correct limit for @xmath85 and @xmath89 . in this work",
    "we define the resolved contribution by the expression ( [ neweq ] ) , and in section 4 , we shall calculate its numerical importance .    when the lowest order expression ( [ neweq ] ) is resummed , it must first be removed from the ho corrections .",
    "we shall call @xmath90 the remaining corrections , and we shall say that the subtraction has been performed at the scale @xmath91 .",
    "in this section we present the results obtained with the nlo code described in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "we shall compare our predictions with a selected set of h1 data @xcite and we shall concentrate on a detailed discussion of the various contributions to the cross section , namely the ho corrections , the virtual photon structure function contribution and the bfkl - like contribution . here",
    "we do not intend to perform a complete phenomenological study of the h1 data @xcite that we shall present in a forthcoming publication .",

    "2 the importance of the ho corrections , especially at small values of @xmath102 is dramatically visible .",
    "as discussed below , it is associated with the opening of new channels .",
    "the resolved component is non - negligible in this range of @xmath103 and @xmath59 .",
    "of course its amplitude depends on the factorization scale , which we discussed in section 3 .",
    "we recall that the factorization scale used here is @xmath104 .",

    "these values lead to a virtual photon structure function proportional to @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",

    "nevertheless we must keep in mind that two points are still missing for a more complete comparison .",
    "first we have not yet studied the scale dependence of our results which have been obtained for the choice @xmath116 , and second , we have not considered ho corrections to the resolved contribution which are known to be large .",
    "indeed we can estimate these corrections by using the weizscker - williams approximation ( [ 8e ] ) which is implemented in the photoproduction ephox code@xcite . from this code",
    "we obtain a ratio @xmath117 in the kinematical domain corresponding to fig .  2 .",
    ".,width=384,height=192 ]    now we turn to a detailed study of the ho contributions . as expected the two contributions corresponding to the feynman graphs shown in fig .",
    "4 are the largest in the forward direction , because of the exchange of a gluon in the @xmath118-channel .",
    "they also correspond to new subprocesses that are not present at the born level , as soon as the observed partons are the final gluon or quark @xmath119  ; therefore they do not possess singular collinear configurations of partons which contribute to the dressing of the distribution and fragmentation functions already present in the born terms .",
    "these graphs , with a trigger on the gluon or quark @xmath119 , also correspond to the born terms of the bfkl ladder in which extra gluons are emitted by the @xmath118-channel gluon .",
    "this is precisely the contribution to the forward cross section @xcite that hera experiments h1 and zeus should reveal .",
    "gev@xmath96.,width=384,height=384 ]    figure 5 compares our bfkl born term contributions and the associated resolved contribution with the total nlo cross section @xmath94 .",
    "these contributions represent more than two thirds of the total nlo corrections in the small @xmath102 region .",
    "actually the bfkl born result of fig .",
    "5 also contains contributions of graphs in which , for instance , the outgoing gluon is attached to the quark line .",
    "however these contributions are expected to be small as they do not possess the @xmath118-singularities ( in a physical gauge ) associated with the exchange of a gluon .",
    "to check this point , we calculated the contributions of the graph shown in fig .  4b . for a forward trigger on the quark @xmath119 , we obtain a cross section seven times larger than the one corresponding to a trigger on the quark @xmath120 ( for @xmath121 ) .",

    "4 is dominant .    .",

    "although obtained in the course of a nlo calculation , these terms of order @xmath124 represent the born terms of new channels , namely the @xmath125 and @xmath126 channels . as for any born terms",
    ", we do expect the contributions of those channels to be strongly dependent on the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "therefore , contrary to our expectations , we are not able to obtain , through our nlo calculations , a total cross section displaying a weak dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "let us be more explicit by studying the effect of the bfkl resummation of the small @xmath127 terms which appears when extra gluons are emitted by the @xmath118-channel gluon of fig .  4 ( the bfkl ladder ) .",
    "these contributions have been estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; they lead to an enhancement of the bfkl born cross section by a factor 5 to 10 , in obvious contradiction with the data",
    ". however the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite depend on various cuts and do not include the effect of ho corrections to the leading bfkl results .",
    "these corrections are known to be large ; this makes the leading results not reliable .",
    "a more recent approach @xcite includes a part of these ho corrections in its predictions and finds an agreement with h1 data @xcite .",
    "this last result , obtained with the scales @xmath128 ( @xmath129 is the momentum of the parton which fragments into the @xmath1 ) , allows us to make a connection with their approach . using the same scales we obtain the result of fig .  6 for the bfkl born term and for the total cross section .",
    "it is obvious that there is room for a bfkl - ladder contribution @xcite between the data and the present theoretical prediction .",
    "however the scale @xmath130 is quite large ( @xmath131  gev in the h1 kinematics ) compared to what is usually used in large-@xmath0 reactions .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath1 hadroproduction in fixed target experiments , a scale @xmath132 ( @xmath133  gev in the h1 kinematics ) is used in ref .",
    "@xcite to get an agreement between data and theory .",
    "if a similar scale were used here , we would obtain better agreement between data and nlo calculations without any other contributions , as is demonstrated in fig .  6 for the choice @xmath134 .",
    "it is clear from this discussion that we can not accurately determine the importance of a bfkl - ladder component in h1 data without calculating nlo correction to the bfkl born terms considered here or , in other words , without calculating nnlo correction to the electroproduction cross section .",
    "conclusions similar to the ones of this section have been obtained by kramer and ptter in their study of the forward leptoproduction of jets @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the leptoproduction of large-@xmath0 @xmath1 in the central region in rapidity ( in the laboratory frame ) with the aim to reduce the bfkl born term contributions and , consequently , to have a better control of the ho corrections . therefore the experimental results obtained in this kinematical domain should provide good tests of qcd and the possibility of measuring the virtual photon structure function .",
    "let us consider the following kinematical range which has been explored by the h1 collaboration in its measurement of the photoproduction of large-@xmath0 hadrons @xcite , namely @xmath135  gev , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "one must notice that this ratio is much smaller than in photoproduction @xcite , since the virtuality of the photon suppresses the resolved contribution .",

    "these corrections are implemented in a parton event - generator offering greater flexibility for the estimation of various observables .",
    "concerning the numerical importance of these corrections , we have focussed on two different kinematical domains , namely the central region in rapidity ( in the hera laboratory frame ) , and the forward region where we compare our results with h1 data .    in the central region",
    "we have found important ho corrections at low @xmath0 .",
    "however these corrections decrease as @xmath0 increases with a @xmath152-factor ( ho/(ho + born ) ) of about .5 obtained for @xmath153  gev / c . in the same range the ho corrections contain a non - negligible resolved contribution which should allow experiment to constrain the virtual photon structure function .    in the forward region ,",
    "we find very large ho corrections due to the opening of new channels related to the bfkl born terms  ; two thirds of the nlo cross section is due to these contributions .",
    "these born terms , and consequently the total nlo cross section , are quite sensitive to scale variations and this forbids any absolute normalization of the cross section .",
    "however one must keep in mind that a good agreement between the h1 data and the nlo cross section is obtained with renormalization and factorization scales taken equal to @xmath154 .",
    "because of the scale sensitivity , no firm conclusion can be drawn on the importance of the bfkl resummation in the forward cross section as measured by the h1 collaboration .",
    "clearly such a study requires the calculation of nnlo corrections to the leptoproduction cross section . +",
