    "et al ( 2008 ) , by combining optical and co observations , we have provided a fresh and very detailed picture of the spiral structure in the tgq , showing that this region is characterized by a complicated spiral pattern .",
    "the outer ( norma - cygnus ) arm is found to be a grand design spiral feature defined by young stars , whereas the region closer to the sun ( d@xmath7 less than 9 kpc ) is dominated by a conspicuous inter - arm structure , at l @xmath2 245@xmath8 , the local spiral arm . in this region ,",
    "perseus is apparently defined by gas and dust , and does not appear to be traced by an evident optical young stellar population , similarly to what can be found in other galaxies such as m  74 ( vzquez et al .",
    "the analysis carried out on a substantial fraction of the stellar fields we observed revealed a complicated mixture of young and old populations .",
    "although centered on catalogued star clusters ( dias et al . 2002 ) , a few colour magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) do not reveal star clusters but , and more interestingly , show hints of a young , diffuse , and distant stellar populations , which has become recently referred to as _ blue plume _",

    "2006 ) , the lines of sight are expected to cross both the thin and thick disk population in front of a particular target , in a way that the analysis of the cmd becomes very challenging ( see for instance the analysis of the field toward the star cluster auner  1 , carraro et al . 2007 ) .    in this paper",

    "the covered areas are shown in figs .",
    "data have been reduced using iraf packages ccdred and daophot .",
    "photometry was done employing the point spread function ( psf ) fitting method ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "particular care has been put in defining the psf model .",
    "a variable psf was adopted due to psf variations across the ccd . in general ,",
    "up to 40 bright stars have been selected for defining the psf model .",
    "aperture corrections were estimated from samples of bright psf stars ( typically 15 ) , and then applied to all the stars .",
    "the corrections amounted to 0.250 - 0.315 , 0.280 - 0.300 , 0.200 - 0.280 , 0.190 - 0.270 , and 0.210 - 0.280 mag for the @xmath4 filters , respectively , over the entire run .",
    "photometric completeness was estimated following baume et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and was determined to be higher than 50@xmath11 at v @xmath2 20 . mag .",
    "as discussed in moitinho et al . ( 2006 ) , up to now the analysis of the stellar populations in the direction of the cma over - density ( martin et al .",
    "2004 , martnez - delgado et al 2004 ) has been performed using only two colours ( mostly b and r ) .",
    "more recent analysis does not deviate from this approach , and dramatically confirms the limitations and uncertainties of having just two colours . in moitinho",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) and carraro et al . ( 2007 ) we have clearly demonstrated that having multicolour photometry is crucial . although being well known , the importance of multicolour measurements is often overlooked . here , as in our previous work",
    ", we stress that the possibility of building colour - colour diagrams ( or two - colour diagram ( tcd ) , especially u - b vs b - v ) is essential when young / early - type stellar populations are present .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the b vs b - r cmd of the center of the cma over - density .",
    "only stars with errors lower than 0.10 mag ( about 10,000 stars ) in both filters are plotted .",
    "the diagram is in every way similar to the one presented in martnez - delgado et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , except for the magnitude range .",
    "their cmd ( their fig .",
    "1 ) is several magnitudes deeper , while the bright stars ( b @xmath12 16.0 ) are saturated .",
    "apart from that , the prominent feature designated as the _ blue plume _ appears very clearly as a sequence of blue stars which detaches from the main sequence ( ms ) at b @xmath219.5 , ( b - r ) @xmath2 1.1 , reaching ( b - r ) as blue as 0.35 , and b as bright as 13.0 mag .",
    "the stars which most probably belong to this feature have been indicated in the same figure with filled triangles ( red when printed in colour).lacking any membership analysis , these stars have been identified by means of an approximate region cut in the cmd .",
    "these same stars are then identified and plotted with the same symbols in fig .  6 to 8 .",
    "we recall that this feature was originally interpreted as the signature of the most recent star formation event in the hypothetical cma _ galaxy _ , occurring 1 - 2 gyrs ago ( bellazzini et al . 2005 ) , and later was suggested as being the blue straggler population of cma ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2006 ) . in both cases",
    ", this feature would not be populated by young stars ( carraro et al .",
    "2007 ) , but having only two filters there is not much more one can add . however ,",
    "if a population 1 - 2 gyr old were present , a distinctive clump of he - burning stars would be evident , which is not the case , as already also emphasized by martnez - delgado et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . indeed , the recent analysis of de jong et al .",
    "( 2006 ) again highlights the difficulty of working with only two filters , which forces the authors to rely upon heavy modeling .",
    "the lack of any spectroscopic information further complicates the scenario . + for completeness , we show in figs . 6 to 8 the cmds of the same region in the v vs b - v , v vs v - i , and v vs u - b planes , respectively",
    ". the same _ blue plume _ ( bp ) as in the b vs b - r cmd can be recognized in fig .  6 and 7 , while bp stars in the v vs u - b plane are mixed with the field dwarf stars . besides the bp , figs .",
    "5 to 7 display a blurred , but still conspicuous blue turn off ( to ) at v @xmath2 17.5@xmath1318.0 , typical of an older , intermediate metallicity , population , as will be discussed further ahead .",
    "following carraro et al . ( 2007 ) , we exploit the entire filter baseline to put more stringent constraints on the properties of the stellar populations in the galactic direction under study .",
    "we employ the u filter in building the tcd in the ( u - b ) vs ( b - v ) plane , which is shown in fig . 9 for all the detected stars having photometric error lower than 0.1 mag .",
    "it is well known that the position of a star in the tcd depends mostly on its spectral type , and does not depend on its distance . the displacement from the zero age main sequences ( zams )",
    "is then caused by its reddening , and , to a minor extent , by its metallicity .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , where zams for dwarf stars from girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are shown for different metallicities .",
    "the effect of interstellar absorption is to produce a displacement from the unreddened zams ( solid line ) along the reddening vector represented in the bottom of fig .  10 for a normal extinction law ( solid arrow ) .",
    "this normal extinction law - characterized by a total to selective absorption ratio @xmath14 = 3.1 - is found to be valid in many regions of the milky way , except for star forming regions . in particular ,",
    "moitinho ( 2001 ) demonstrated that this law is valid in the tgq .",
    "the effect of metallicity is only marginally important for stars with spectral types earlier than a0 , and becomes sizable for spectral types f - g , increasing the size of the bell shaped feature introduced by the ultraviolet excess ( sandage et al .",
    "1969 , norris et al .",
    "the larger the effect , the lower the metal content of a star . for",
    "even later spectral types , the trend is to have the ( b - v ) colour redder and the ( u - b ) bluer at decreasing metallicity .    by inspecting fig .  9 , one can immediately recognize two remarkable features .",
    "@xmath15 the first one is the presence of a group of young stars ( at b - v bluer than @xmath2 0.5 ) spread both in b - v and in u - b by different amount of reddening .",
    "this corresponds to the high luminosity component of the _ blue plume _",
    "visible in all the different cmds in figs .",
    "5 to 7 .",
    "@xmath15 the other one is at the expected location of f and g stars , namely a prominent population of metal poor stars .",
    "this population corresponds to the bulk of blue stars visible in the cmds of figs .",
    "5 to 7 in the form of a thick ms having the brightest to at v @xmath2 18.0@xmath1318.5 .",
    "no clear indications of a red giant branch ( rgb ) or rg clump are visible in the various cmds , due to the combined effects of variable reddening , metallicity and distance , which altogether concur to spread the stars in the rgb region .",
    "in this section we focus on the two prominent features of the tcd shown in fig .  9 and mentioned in the previous section .",
    "to this aim , we have split the stars in different v magnitude bins , and produced the corresponding tcds .",
    "the idea behind this approach is that at increasing v magnitude we are mainly picking up stars with larger reddening and distance , as exhaustively illustrated in carraro et al .",
    "the various tcds are shown in fig .",
    "we start by analyzing the different panels in fig .",
    "11 to characterize the young stellar population .",
    "it is straightforward to recognize how early spectral type stars composing the _ blue plume _ are mostly evident between v @xmath2 15 and v @xmath2 17 , with the peak of the distribution in the @xmath16 panel .",
    "here we face a group a young stars with spectral types in the range b5-a0 reddened by e(b - v ) = 0.25@xmath170.10 .",
    "the typical absolute magnitude m@xmath18 of these stars is in the range 0.1 - 0.6 , and therefore we estimate them to lie at about 9.8@xmath19 kpc from the sun . having such spectral types ,",
    "these stars are younger than 100 myr or so ( carraro et al . 2005 , moitinho et al . 2006 ) .",
    "in all the other panels of fig .",
    "11 there is only marginal evidence of the same early spectral type stellar population leading to the conclusion that this population is located at any distance along the line of sight , but with a clear peak at about 10 kpc .    at 10 kpc and @xmath20",
    ", these young stars perfectly match the distance and position of the galactic outer and local spiral arms ( moitinho et al .",
    "2006 , vzquez et al .",
    "moreover , we have shown that along this line of sight the local ( orion arm ) is a remarkable structure that stays close to the formal galactic plane , @xmath21 , for about 6 - 7 kpc , and then starts bending , following the warping of the disk . at the latitude sampled in this work",
    ", the orion arm is expected to reach the outer arm . so that what is seen is material located all the way along the local arm until it reaches the outer arm , causing the appearance of a stellar over - density .",
    "this is a clear demonstration that , although remarkable , the distribution of young bp stars in cma is that expected from the warped spiral structure of the galaxy and does not require postulating the presence of an accreted dwarf galaxy in cma .",
    "the decomposition of the tcd in magnitude bins , as shown fig .  11 , also allows to better understand the nature of the older stellar population toward the cma over - density .",
    "the conspicuous broad bell - shaped structure , likely produced by ultraviolet excess , is visible in all the tcds downward v @xmath22 15 , and appears with increasing importance at increasing magnitude down to the limit of our observations .",
    "this morphology suggests that the majority of these stars are f - g dwarfs spanning a variety of metallicities .",
    "it is difficult to assign a precise metallicity range , due to photometric errors and different amount of reddening .",
    "however , the bulk of these dwarfs may probably span metallicities from about solar ( z=0.019 ) to much lower than solar ( probably down to z=0.004 , see fig .",
    "it is useful to compare these tcds with the ones presented by norris et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for metal poor stars .",
    "the same bell shape feature as in their fig .",
    "1c fully supports our interpretation of these stars being mostly dwarf metal poor stars . at such a galactic latitude , and taking into account the relatively low absorption",
    ", we expect to encounter along the line of sight a mix of metal poor stars from the thick disk and from the halo .",
    "comparison of the colour of our ( u - b ) envelope with the one of norris et al .",
    "( 1999 ; u - b as blue as -0.35 , see their fig .",
    "2 ) , suggests the presence of stars as metal poor as [ fe / h ] @xmath22 -2.2 dex .",
    "in addition , the series of tcds in fig .",
    "11 also reveals the presence of stars with spectral types later than f , both dwarfs and giants , at any magnitude bin down to v @xmath2 19 .",
    "these stars have spectral types from f - g to k and exhibit approximately the same scatter in the different panels , meaning they are affected by the same amount of reddening independently of the magnitude bin .",
    "this confirms the results of previous studies indicating that reddening along this line of sight does not change significantly with distance ( fitzgerald 1968 , vzquez et al .",
    "2008 ) , and therefore the spread is mostly due to metallicity .    the metal poor population is also an older one , since it corresponds to the bulk of blue dwarf stars fainter than v @xmath2 18.0 in the cmds of fig .  6 and 7 . in this part of the cmd one can recognize a to at v@xmath218.0@xmath1318.5 , in the form of an abrupt change of the stellar density at about the position where the _ blue plume _ merges with the nearby dwarf ms .",
    "the shape of this to provides an estimate of the age of the population and its minimum distance . to this aim",
    "we consider a mean metallicity of z = 0.010 , and choose a suitable isochrone with the purpose of guiding the eye and providing constraints on the age and distance which match the shape of the to the best .",
    "a reddening of e(v - i ) = 0.18 is adopted as representative of this galactic direction ( see also previous subsection ) .",
    "this value agrees with the maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and of amores & lpine ( 2007 ) .    in fig .",
    "12 we superimpose a 6 gyr isochrone on the v vs v - i cmd ( the one where the to is more visible ) , which matches the shape of the to for the adopted metallicity and reddening .",
    "this implies a distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath23 14.3 , a distance of 6 kpc and a height of 800 pc below the @xmath24 plane .",
    "the same isochrone is also plotted for a distance modulus of @xmath2 15.3 and a higher reddening of e(v - i ) = 0.38 ( to take into account the larger distance ) , which corresponds to a distance of 7.5 kpc and a height below the plane of almost 1 kpc .",
    "these two lines encompass the bulk of red giant stars , suggesting that the bulk of the population is mostly around this age . by experimenting with a larger set of isochrones",
    ", we found acceptable fits with ages of 6@xmath172 gyrs and a metallicity range of z=0.010@xmath170.06 .",
    "as discussed in carraro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , where a field in the direction of the open cluster auner  1 was studied , these values are fully compatible with the thick disk of the milky way ( bensby et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the large distance covered by this metal poor population is consistent with a thick disk bending and becoming more distant at increasing height below the galactic plane .",
    "we have presented a photometric analysis in the @xmath4 filters of 3 wide field pointings close to the center of the canis major over - density . the goal was to study the stellar populations in this region of the milky way , where a putative dwarf galaxy in the act of being cannibalized by the milky way , is claimed to exist .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper followed a different strategy from previous investigations of the cma over - density . instead of studying very large fields in two filters ,",
    "we have concentrated on a smaller area , but observed in several filters .",
    "this approach , frequently employed in the study of star clusters , allowed us to construct several cmds and the classical ( b - v ) vs ( u - b ) tcd , which together constitute a very powerful tool for detecting young stellar populations .",
    "as in our previous studies of stellar fields in the tgq we found evidence of a diffuse young stellar population , as expected from the presence of the local and outer galactic spiral arms ( carraro et al .",
    "2005 , moitinho et al .",
    "2006 , vzquez et al .",
    "once again , no indication has been found of an ongoing accretion event in this direction of the galactic disk .",
    "in addition , the estimated ranges of distance , age and metallicity of the older metal poor population are consistent with those of thick disk stars at different distances from the sun .",
    "these findings , together with the results of previous papers by us and other authors ( momany et al 2004 , 2007 ) , significantly weaken the proposed scenario of a dwarf galaxy in cma being cannibalized by the milky way .",
    "instead , all the observational evidence fits our current knowledge of the galactic disk .",
    "the tgq is indeed a complicated region due to the warp and the existence of the local arm .",
    "only the detailed multicolour analysis we have been conducting in the last few years could provide a clear picture of the structure of the outer disk in the tgq .",
    "this study made use of the simbad and webda databases .",
