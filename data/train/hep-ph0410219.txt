    "hard pqcd reactions produce highly virtual partons that will radiate off their virtualities , thus evolving into the non - perturbative states that contain observable hadrons .",
    "a quantitative understanding of this process , known broadly as the fragmentation of partons , considerably widens the class of reactions that can be handled within a perturbative qcd approach .",
    "examples are too many to enumerate here ( as the reader may convince himself by browsing through the proceedings ) , two recent cases will be discussed below in sections [ sec : all ] and [ sec : rho ] .    a graph such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fac ] serves as a popular illustration of qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "it also displays the role of fragmentation functions @xmath2 in hard scattering phenomenology when there are detected hadrons in the final state .",
    "the early field & feynman @xcite cascade model for quark fragmentation into mesons is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fiefeycoso ] side by side with a    later field - theoretic definition in terms of a bilocal operator @xcite . at leading twist accuracy ,",
    "these describe fragmentation ( or decay ) functions ( now in a narrower sense of the word ) that turn a single parton into a single - hadron inclusive state , with fractional momentum transfer @xmath3 from the parton to the hadron .",
    "analogous to parton densities , renormalization induces evolution of the ( transposed ) dglap type : @xmath4    this write - up discusses a few theoretical aspects of fragmentation functions and fragmentation processes",
    ". please confer also k.  hamacher s contribution to these proceedings @xcite for experimental results .",
    "fragmentation functions are determined in nlo qcd fits to data .",
    "they are statistically dominated by @xmath5 annihilations with particularly precise @xmath6 data from @xmath7 decays at lep and sld . even though the @xmath5 data can be reproduced very successfully over a wide range of energy ,",
    "there are several limitations :    1 .",
    "the leading order partonic process @xmath8 produces quarks only ; the subleading terms are too weak to constrain gluon fragmentation sufficiently .",
    "gluon - quark mixing in the evolution eq .",
    "( [ eq : dglap ] ) is not enough of a constraint , either .",
    "[ item : gluon ] 2 .",
    "data are less accurate at large-@xmath3 .",
    "this fact translates into less accurate functions @xmath9 .",
    "[ item : largez ] 3 .   the individual light flavour channels ( corresponding to the `` ranks '' in fig .  [ fig : fiefeycoso ] )",
    "can not be disentangled from the flavour inclusive data .",
    "[ item : flavour ]    these items limit , at present , the accuracy of the functions @xmath10 .",
    "they require that fragmentation analyses become truly global the way that analyses of parton densities already are , i.e.  including data from different processes that constrain different kinematic regions and flavour combinations .",
    "recent global analyses of fragmentation functions , determined at next - to - leading - order accuracy in qcd , were performed in @xcite .",
    "the individual fits are conceptually very similar , such that a comparison between the fits gives a good first estimate of the uncertainties in the functions @xmath10 . as explained above , the uncertainties of these functions are data driven and can be large . it can indeed be shown @xcite that the electroweak couplings of up and down type quarks at the @xmath7 pole suggest that only flavour - insensitive combinations such as the singlet @xmath11 are well determined .",
    "flavour structure can be constraint through the analysis of semi - inclusive dis @xcite .",
    "the simple lowest order term @xmath12\\ ] ] illustrates that the information is local in @xmath3 ( no convolution at lo ) and that the by now very good knowledge of the parton distributions @xmath13 provides reliable flavour weights .",
    "having discussed item [ item : flavour ] , we are still left with items [ item : gluon ] , [ item : largez ] from our shopping list above .",
    "they lead over to the analysis of hadroproduction reactions .",
    "rhic ( @xmath14 mode ) operates at @xmath1 gev , between lower energies ( such as isr or fermilab ) , where the pqcd calculations are known to be problematic @xcite , and higher cms energies ( up to @xmath15 ) , where pqcd seems to work @xcite .",
    "it was quite remarkable to see , how well pion production data in rhic @xmath14 collisions @xcite agree with the nlo qcd calculation @xcite at central and forward rapidity and down to @xmath0 values as low as @xmath16 gev .",
    "while it remains a challenge to understand the @xmath17 dependence of hadroproduction spectra in terms of power corrections @xcite , the good agreement of the pion spectrum with nlo qcd at @xmath18 and the good precision of the rhic data are a goldmine for fragmentation analyses .",
    "[ fig : fracs ] decomposes rhic collisions into 2-parton initial and    1-parton - inclusive final states . for fig .",
    "[ fig : avxz ]    the corresponding scaling variables have been evaluated at their average values , manifesting the symmetric and asymmetric kinematics of central and forward rapidities , respectively .",
    "the parton densities are probed in regions of @xmath19 where they are well known already whereas new constraints are imposed on the large-@xmath3 fragmentation functions , and in particular on the gluon function . while the constraint on the gluon fragmentation function is nonlocal ( convoluted ) in hadroproduction reactions , a qcd analysis of this reaction is more straightforward than an analysis of anti - tagged gluon jets in @xmath20 configurations @xcite .",
    "the latter are nontrivial due to the fact that jets and fragmentation functions are not the same in qcd .",
    "i will next leave the fragmentation functions and move on to discussing theoretical aspects of two recent pion production measurements at rhic .",
    "the gluon helicity contribution @xmath22 to the proton spin is probed in collisions of longitudinally polarized protons under the condition that the dominant dynamics are perturbative and of leading twist origin .",
    "these conditions may apply to the measurement of beam helicity asymmetries @xmath23 for high transverse momentum reactions where @xmath24 . for large @xmath0 pion production , a variant of fig .",
    "[ fig : fac ] with polarized beams illustrates that the ( glue - glue contribution to the ) reaction can schematically be written as @xmath25 the mellin transform @xmath26 [ with @xmath27 etc . ] turns the nonlocal ( in parton momentum , i.e.  @xmath28 ) convolutions @xmath29 into products that are local in the moments @xmath30 . for small to medium @xmath31 gev one",
    "can then show @xcite by variation @xmath32 that @xmath21 has a minimum and is basically positive definite at leading twist , i.e. @xmath33 is a necessary condition for leading twist dynamics to be dominant in the production of small to medium @xmath0 pions . to achieve a _",

    "( [ eq : conv ] ) can then pick @xmath28 such that @xmath38 . for any foreseeable experimental accuracy @xmath39 which is why @xmath40 is `` basically '' positive definite . at present , data @xcite are statistically not conclusive and the positivity of @xmath21 remains yet to be confirmed , or disproved .",
    "recent data @xcite indicate that the invariant mass spectrum of pion pairs in @xmath14 collisions peaks at a value around , but significantly below , the @xmath42 mass as measured in @xmath5 exclusive production .",
    "now , resonance mass shifts would seem an unlikely manifestation of a perturbative effect if it were not for the fact that the effect extends to large values of transverse momentum @xmath43 gev where the @xmath42 can be expected to be a parton fragment .",
    "the strong decay @xmath44 then contributes a p - wave resonance to the @xmath45 fragmentation function @xcite .- hadron fragmentation with @xmath46-hadron ( @xmath47 ) fragmentation , as well as the non - resonant @xmath48 wave channel . ]    in fig .",

    "( [ eq : kps ] ) differs from the operator product depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fiefeycoso ] which is defined to be uv - divergent [ after integration over @xmath51 .",
    "the argument i am about to make , though , is not related to the subtle @xcite problems that arise from cutting off momentum integrals .",
    "the partonic center of mass energy @xmath52 can , for an order of magnitude estimate , be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : avxz ] through @xmath53 . under the assumption that the partonic spectrum behaves like @xmath54 , a breit - wigner peak in the @xmath55 mass spectrum  positioned at the @xmath42 mass for @xmath56  is then shifted to a lower value by a few 10 mev around a finite @xmath57 .",
    "this suggests a partonic effect that is dual to the pion phase space distortion at low @xmath58 .",
    "a more detailed evaluation will be given in @xcite .",
    "parton fragmentation processes explore conceptually and phenomenologically rich aspects of hadronization , as i hope to have demonstrated through the examples of a positivity bound on the spin asymmetry @xmath40 and a perturbative ansatz to explain resonance mass shifts at high @xmath0 .",
