    ", one can manipulate @xcite and measure single quantum systems with extremely high precision .",
    "possible applications range from atom interferometry @xcite , over quantum gates @xcite and resonant condensate transport @xcite , to nonlinear atom optics @xcite .    in particular atom interferometry",
    "has attracted a lot of interest since atoms are massive objects sensitive to gravity .",
    "this opens new ways for measuring the gravitational constant  @xcite , detection of gravitational waves , or the search for dark energy  @xcite .",
    "using non - classical ( squeezed ) states brings the measurement sensitivity below the quantum noise limit  @xcite .",
    "squeezed atom number states are typically created through condensate splitting and manipulation of the condensate around the point where the tunnel coupling strength becomes comparable with the nonlinear atom - atom interaction  @xcite .",
    "possible routes towards squeezing are based on quasi - adiabatic splitting  @xcite or one - axis twisting  @xcite .",
    "it is often advantageous to seek for fast squeezing , for instance to achieve measurement series with high repetition rates or to suppress dephasing losses due to thermally excited atoms .",
    "in @xcite we demonstrated fast squeezing protocols that were obtained by using optimal control theory ( oct )  @xcite , a mathematical device allowing for optimization of certain control objectives .",
    "oct protocols were succesfully implemented in atom chip experiments for twin - atom production  @xcite and interferometry  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we theoretically investigate the generation of squeezed states in a split bec through parametric amplification .",
    "for a harmonic oscillator , parametric amplification can be achieved by modulating the spring constant with twice the resonance frequency , leading to an exponential increase of the oscillator s amplitude  @xcite .",
    "similarly , modulating the tunnel coupling strength with twice the josephson frequency leads to an exponential increase of number and phase fluctuations . to achieve fast squeezing ,",
    "say on a time scale of 10 ms , one needs rather large tunnel coupling modulations which lead to additonal wavefunction oscillations of the split condensate , thus rendering the state useless for further interferometry once the wells become separated .",
    "we demonstrate that a final splitting stage of 2 ms , optimized with oct , brings the condensate at a final time to halt and freezes the system in a highly squeezed state .",
    "the motivation of this work lies in a direct experimental implementation .",
    "while the combined parametric amplification and splitting scheme investigated in this work leads to a slightly better squeezing compared to previous work  @xcite , it is additionally simpler to implement and facilitates state tomography by releasing the condensate at different times and recording the time - of - flight images  @xcite .",

    ", we consider a 1d representation of a bec in a double well trap , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ dwintro ] .",
    "we assume that the trap is produced by the magnetic fields generated by an atom chip  @xcite , which allow us to transform the potential from a single to a double well , thus creating a split bec , and to change the distance between the two wells  @xcite in order to control the interwell coupling . within the field of bec interferometry , in the waiting phase",
    "the atoms in the two wells are decoupled and acquire different phases due to interactions with some external ( classical ) probe , such as gravity or magnetic fields .",
    "the phase shifts are finally read out through bec interference .",
    "the physics of double - well becs is conveniently described in terms of a two - mode model , similar to josephson junctions @xcite , where each atom can either reside in the left or the right well . with @xmath1 atoms in the bec , we can map the model to a spin @xmath2 system that captures many phenomena of double - well becs .",
    "we introduce the pseudo spin operators  @xcite @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the annihilation and creation operators for an atom in the left / right well , respectively .",
    "these operators have the following physical interpretations : @xmath6 exchanges an atom between the left and the right well , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 measure the phase difference and atom number imbalance between the two wells , respectively . with these operators",
    "we can write down a model hamiltonian in the form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the tunneling energy , accounting for the interwell tunneling , and @xmath11 is the charging energy describing the nonlinear interaction between atoms .",
    "for the interwell distances of our present concern , @xmath10 can be assumed to be approximately proportional to the distance of the two wells ( see fig .  [ dwintro ] ) , while @xmath11 has in general a more complicated behavior .",
    "both quantities can be computed within the gross - pitaevskii framework  @xcite .",
    "states of a two - level quantum mechanical system ( qubit ) are conveniently depicted on the bloch sphere  @xcite .",
    "such visualization is also possible for the two - mode model with a rather intuitive interpretation : a state where all the atoms are in the left or right well corresponds to a bloch state on the north or south pole .",
    "we introduce @xmath12 for the atom number imbalance , with @xmath13 being the number of atoms in the left / right well .",
    "states where the atom number is exactly balanced , @xmath14 , are on the equator , and the angle @xmath15 describes the relative phase between the two wells ( see fig .  [ bsintro ] ) .",
    "in addition to the mean values , also the atom number and phase uncertainties @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be seen on the bloch sphere : @xmath16 corresponds to the height and @xmath17 to the width of the distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bsintro](a ) . for any interferometry experiment ,",
    "the important observable to be measured in the end is either the relative phase or number imbalance between the wells .",
    "both measurements are subject to ( shot ) noise limiting the measurement precision , and thus render states with large @xmath16 and @xmath17 fluctuations unfavorable . on the other hand , reduction of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is possible but bound by the important relation  @xcite @xmath18 stating that we can in principle decrease one of the variances , however , at the cost of increasing the other one . for a binomial state we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 , leading to standard quantum shot noise  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for states with smaller @xmath16 or @xmath17 values , the so - called _ squeezed states _ , we can achieve a measurement precision below standard quantum shot noise  @xcite .    in order to quantify how much a state",
    "is squeezed several factors have been used in the literature .",
    "the so - called number squeezing and phase squeezing factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , provide information about how much a given state is squeezed in comparison to a binomial one . both factors equal one for a binomial state .",
    "however , these factors completely neglect the coherence of the split condensate , a quantity of paramount importance for interferometry .",
    "coherence is additionally considered by the factor  @xcite @xmath23 where we have used the fact that @xmath24 at equilibrium to arrive at the last expression on the right hand side .",
    "it is now convenient to introduce the so - called coherent spin squeezing factor  @xcite @xmath25 which is a direct measure of the useful number squeezing in the context of interferometry . in the following",
    "we will refer to states with low squeezing factors as `` highly squeezed states '' .",
    "squeezed states can not only be used for measurements with precisions beyond the standard quantum limit  @xcite , but also have other interesting properties .",
    "for instance , number squeezed states are very robust against dephasing effects  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to find ways of producing number or phase squeezed states , ideally on short time scales .",
    "a possible route towards number squeezing is to simply increase the distance between the two wells quasi - adiabatically  @xcite : this reduces tunneling and , in turn , @xmath16 , since the number squeezing in the groundstate of eq .",
    "increases with decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "additionally @xmath26 increases . however , this process is relatively slow .    in this paper",
    "we will explore a different approach towards highly phase or number squeezed states on short time scales , which relies on parametric amplification through a periodic modulation of the tunnel coupling with twice the resonance frequency . in the following we briefly recall the mechanism underlying parametric amplification .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) and rewrite it using the particle imbalance @xmath27 and the relative phase @xmath28  @xcite , @xmath29 in the coupled regime the relative phase is assumed to be very small , so we can approximate @xmath30 .",
    "apart from an irrelevant constant energy shift , this expansion leads to @xmath31 from the commutation relations of the spin operators one observes that @xmath28 and @xmath27 are canonically conjugate quantities , obeying @xmath32=i$ ] @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ham3 ] ) thus has exactly the same form as the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator , with phase and number playing the role of momentum and position , and the `` mass '' of the oscillator given by @xmath33 . starting with a small amplitude at time zero , parametric amplification for",
    "the harmonic oscillator occurs for a time - dependent @xmath10 which is modulated with twice the josephson frequency @xmath34 .",
    "this leads to an exponential increase of the oscillator s amplitude , in case of eq .",
    "the density @xmath27 .",
    "we emphasize that parametric amplification is also possible for higher @xmath28 values without performing a taylor expansion of @xmath35 , as discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    since for a split bec we can modulate the tunneling parameter @xmath10 by changing the distance between the wells",
    ", we can use parametric amplification in order to increase squeezing .",
    "we first start with a slightly number squeezed groundstate of a split but still tunnel - coupled bec in a double well . in a next step , we modulate @xmath10 with twice the josephson frequency to get parametric squeezing amplification .",
    "in contrast to the above example of the harmonic oscillator , the @xmath10 modulation leads to an amplification of the fluctuations rather than the mean values .",
    "in this section we show how to achieve parametric amplification for a bec in a double well with realistic experimental parameters , in order to achieve high number or phase squeezing . to describe the bec correctly , a simple two mode model with static orbitals is not sufficient , as will be discussed below , and one has to resort to a description scheme that accounts for both the atom number and wavefunction dynamics . in this work",
    "we employ the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb )  @xcite using our recently developed matlab toolbox octbec  @xcite .",
    "associated with rf fields of an atom chip .",

    "but for an amplitude of 5% .",
    "the black line reports for comparison results for a two parameter optimization  @xcite . ]",
    "we simulate parametric amplification of a bec consisting of 1000 atoms in a double well potential within mctdhb(2 )  @xcite , which expands the bec wavefunction in two orbitals .",
    "the trap is a lesanovsky type potential  @xcite , giving rise to elongated , cigar shaped condensates . in this potential , the relevant splitting and amplification dynamics occurs in the radial direction , which allows us to introduce a 1d description scheme .",
    "the lesanovsky potential has a single parameter @xmath36 , associated with the amplitude of a radio frequency field , that can turn the trap from a single into a double well , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ les ] .      in our simulations",
    ", we start with a bec corresponding to the split ground state of the double well ( we use @xmath38 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally that this state can be realized through adiabatic splitting of an elongated single atom trap , without generating significant heating or a noticable thermal fraction  @xcite .",
    "finite temperature effects might lead to a slight broadening of @xmath17 but will not significantly influence the spin squeezing factor @xmath37  @xcite . in experiment , this might reduce the time that is avalaible for the parametric amplification .    in the split ground state",
    "the spin squeezing factor is initially already smaller than one ( @xmath39 for @xmath38 ) .",
    "starting at time zero , the distance between the double well is modulated with twice the josephson frequency @xmath40  hz , giving rise to a parametric amplification of squeezing .",
    "the squeezing value mainly depends on the amplitude of the modulation .",
    "[ pa1 ] and [ pa2 ] show the spin squeezing factor @xmath37 and the atomic density during parametric amplification for @xmath36-modulations with amplitudes of 1% and 5% , respectively .",
    "the density oscillates periodically for an amplitude of 1% , while strong excitation and non - periodic features can be observed for 5% .",
    "parametric amplification with an amplitude of 1% only produces a squeezing factor of @xmath41 @xmath42  db ) , while the modulation with 5% leads to a much better squeezing of @xmath43 ( @xmath44  db ) .",
    "however , squeezing becomes worse after roughly 10 ms .",
    "we attribute this degradation to dephasing effects : as depicted in fig .",
    "[ curl ] , at later times the number distribution becomes curled around the @xmath45-axis of the bloch sphere , indicating the partial occupation of states where all atoms reside in the left or right well , leading to complicated ensuing number dynamics with a net effect reminiscent of dephasing .",
    "a key requirement for interferometry on atom chips is a reliable and fast generation of squeezed states . to boost parametric amplification on short time scales",
    ", one has to use sufficiently high tunnel coupling modulations , which , in turn , lead to excitations of the condensate wave function . in this context , the consideration of both the atom number and wavefunction dynamics becomes mandatory in a simulation approach , thus calling for realistic many - body simulation approaches such as the mctdhb framework of this work .",
    "additionally , following the parametric amplification one has to modify the trap potential in such a way that the orbitals are brought to a halt .",
    "this step will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the main advantage of parametric squeezing amplification compared to other routes towards number squeezing  @xcite is that the whole parametric amplification process can be implemented experimentally very easily , and only the final trapping stage requires some fine - tuning of the atom chip potentials . for comparison , the black line in fig .",
    "[ pa2 ] reports results for a two parameter optimization  @xcite , whose final @xmath37 value is also comparable to genuine oct protocols for the optimization of number squeezing  @xcite . note that in comparison to these optimized protocols our simple parametric amplification scheme already leads to higher squeezing .",

    "right well become populated , leading to a time evolution where the distribution `` curls '' around the bloch sphere and squeezing is diminished .",
    "see fig .  2 for color bar .",
    "]          to make parametric amplification useful in the context of squeezing generation , we should be able to trap the bec after amplification in a highly number squeezed state and separate the two wells far enough to inhibit interwell tunneling .",
    "we will refer to the stage where the condensate is brought to a halt as `` trapping '' , not to be confused with the atom trapping in order to produce a bec on the atom chip .",
    "trapping is shown in fig .",
    "[ trap1 ] ( for details see discussion below ) and is accomplished within the framework of oct .",
    "the general goal of oct is to solve the following inverse problem : suppose that the state of a system @xmath46 is known at some initial time @xmath47 , and we are seeking for a desired state @xmath48 at some final time @xmath49 . in order to bring the system from @xmath46 to @xmath48",

    ", the time dependence of the control parameter that brings the system from the initial to the desired state is unknown .",
    "oct allows to find an optimal control in an iterative process .",

    "we employ the grape algorithm implemented in the octbec toolbox  @xcite .",
    "the oct ingredients are the initial state of our system @xmath46 , a dynamic equation for the system s time evolution ( here mctdhb ) , and a cost function that rates the success for a given control field @xmath50 .",

    ", we are seeking for highly number squeezed states and for condensates at rest .",
    "this can be accomplished through a cost function of the form @xmath51 which consists of two parts : the first one favors strongly number - squeezed states , the second one minimal energy and thus a condensate at rest .",
    "@xmath52 is a parameter that weights the relative importance for these two optimization goals .",
    "a slight complication arises for the squeezing term in eq .  , as @xmath8 is defined in the left - right basis whereas the natural mctdhb basis is a gerade - ungerade basis  @xcite . to switch between the two bases , we use @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the relative phase between the orbitals , which is obtained from the wave function overlap for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 denotes the heaviside step function ) @xmath57",
