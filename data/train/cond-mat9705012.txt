    "in 1985 r.p.feynman made the following prophetic statement . `` _ it seems to me that the laws of physics present no barrier to reducing the size of computers until bits are the size of atoms and quantum behaviour holds sway _ ' ' @xcite .",
    "well , here we are only a decade later and technological advances in microfabrication have enabled us to not only manipulate individual atoms but even single electrons .",
    "it is the manipulation of single - electrons , and the properties of a few interacting electrons confined on small islands of semiconducting material , called ` quantum dots ' , that we shall be concerned with here .",
    "such quantum dots typically consist of a few hundred to a few million atoms are thus still some way from being the single atoms to which feynman referred .",
    "nevertheless , these quantum dot islands can behave in many ways like single atoms as pointed out by kastner , who coined the term ` artificial atom ' @xcite .",
    "certainly they can exhibit many of the quantum effects associated with their true atomic counterparts , where likewise few electrons are held together by the nuclear potential .",
    "however , these structures exhibit new physics which , whilst being quantum in origin , have no analogue in real atoms and influences their electrical properties . these effects , which we will describe below , are due to the interactions between the electrons .",
    "it turns out that _ correlations _ dominate the physics in many cases and render the independent - electron approximation useless , leading to even qualitatively incorrect results @xcite .",
    "this should be compared with real atoms for which hartree - fock is an excellent approximation , providing at least the correct qualitative behaviour of atoms and a means for obtaining solutions of arbitrary accuracy in a controlled way by configuration mixing and perturbation theory .",
    "the origin of this different behaviour for artificial atoms with a small number of electrons is the nature of the confining potential which , being usually harmonic , is much more shallow than the @xmath0 potential of real atoms .",
    "this results in a lower electron density ( larger mean separation between electrons ) than is the case for atoms and the electron configurations can approach the classical ( wigner ) limit in which the electrons are in fixed positions which minimise the electrostatic energy .",
    "single electron effects can be observed in the electrical transport properties of small conducting particles that are weakly coupled to their environment @xcite .",
    "a simple example is a small ( nanoscale ) metallic grain surrounded by a thin insulating layer .",
    "indeed such metallic ` dots ' can be fabricated in a controlled way these days , for example gold particles encapsulated by organic molecules and placed on a gold surface @xcite .",
    "electrons can be made to tunnel into the dot and out through the substrate to produce a current using a fine probe such as an stm tip .",
    "when this is done , a finite voltage is required at low temperatures before any current is produced and the @xmath1 curve is antisymmetric about @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "this finite turn - on voltage is referred to as the ` coulomb gap ' and occurs because of the very small capacitance of the island , as we explain in the next section .",
    "an even more spectacular effect is observed when a third ( gate ) electrode is introduced , as we describe below . a schematic diagram of one such structure , similar to that fabricated by meirav _",
    "et al _ @xcite , is shown in fig .",
    "it consists of a heterojunction between two semiconductors ( such as gaas and alas ) , a top and bottom gate ( the top gate being patterned ) and source and drain contacts .",
    "the wider gap semiconductor is doped with donors and the carriers migrate to the narrower gap semiconductor where they form a thin sheet of charge at the heterojunction interface , _",
    "i.e. _ a quasi two - dimensional electron sheet ( 2des ) . when the top gate is biased negatively , the electrons beneath it in the 2des are repelled and , without the four ` stubs ' on the gate",
    ", this would give rise to a thin filament of charge , converting the 2des into a quasi one - dimensional wire .",
    "the purpose of the stubs is to give rise to barrier for electrons , which defines a small potential well , as shown in the electron potential energy diagram of fig .",
    "( this is for a plane close to the heterojunction interface where the charge density would be a maximum for the 2des in the absence of the top gate . )",
    "the fermi energy of the electrons near the heterojunction interface can be adjusted by changing the voltage on one or both gates . at low temperatures",
    "there is little or no current through the device when a small source - drain voltage is applied _ except _ in the region of certain gate voltages when a current flows .",
    "this behaviour is shown in the @xmath3 curve of fig .",
    "4 . the current switches on and off as the gate voltage is increased .",
    "this behaviour can be explained roughly as follows ( a more precise explanation will be given in the next section ) .",
    "the gate voltages may be adjusted such that the fermi energy lies below the bottom of the quantum well but still above the quasi 1d ` leads ' at either side of the well as shown in fig .",
    "5a , where the shaded region represents the quasi 1d fermi sea .",
    "the forbidden gap region below the well is too wide to permit tunnelling in one jump from one lead to the other and hence at low temperature there is negligible current . if the gate voltage is adjusted so that the quantum well is lowered in energy ( by making the bottom gate voltage more positive ) then eventually the fermi energy will be above the bottom of the well and a current will flow with electrons tunnelling into and out of the dot ( fig .",
    "this is rather like what happens in a field effect transistor ( fet ) , which is ` switched on ' by applying a gate voltage .",
    "however , unlike the fet , the device may be switched off by further increasing the gate voltage .",
    "this is because there are no empty states in the leads available for the electron to leave the dot when the well is lowered in energy .",
    "furthermore , a second electron may also not enter the dot because of the large energy associated with the coulomb repulsion between two electrons ( or , equivalently , the very tiny effective capacitance of the dot ) .",
    "this switching off of the current is known as _ coulomb blockade_@xmath4 a further increase in the gate voltage lowers the energy of the electron on the dot sufficiently that a second electron may enter the dot .",
    "this occurs when @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the fermi energy in the lead , @xmath7 is the lowest energy in the well and @xmath8 is the coulomb repulsion energy between the two electrons on the dot . since",
    "empty states are also available at energy @xmath6 in the drain lead , an electron may leave the dot again , giving rise once more to a finite current . in this way we get a sequence of sharp spikes in the current vs gate voltage curve as shown in fig .",
    "we also point out that the coulomb blockade is still effective when there is a current flowing",
    ". the number of electrons on the quantum dot can be either @xmath9 or @xmath10 but other values are suppressed .",
    "an electron hopping onto the dot must leave it before another electron may enter . in this way",
    "the current is due to single electrons with mean spacing determined by the tunnelling time through the strongest barrier .",
    "the quantum dots described above have some similarity with atoms in the sense that they usually have an integral number of electrons ( coulomb blockade mode ) and there is an energy cost to either remove an electron ( ionisation ) or add an electron ( affinity ) , as with atoms .",
    "furthermore , the number of electrons on the dot may be changed by changing the fermi energy .",
    "this is analogous to a change of valence of real atoms which may be effected by changing the local chemical potential .",
    "the analogy with atoms is somewhat closer for semiconductor dots than for metallic grains since the latter will typically contain many millions of conduction electrons whilst the former will usually have a small number , with @xmath11 corresponding to artificial @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , despite these similarities , there are important differences between real atoms and artificial atoms as we shall see in section [ energy ] .",
    "there is a simple semi - classical model which explains with reasonable accuracy the behaviour of artificial atoms as described in the previous section @xcite .",
    "consider a metallic particle on an insulating surface to which we attach source leads via thin insulating ( tunnel ) barriers , as shown in fig .",
    "we introduce a positively charged ` gate ' electrode close to the metal particle but sufficiently insulated from it that charge may may not tunnel . by applying a small bias between the leads",
    "we observe that the current shows oscillations with gate potential , similar to those of fig .",
    "a semi - quantitative explanation is as follows .",
    "let the capacitance of the metal particle be @xmath13 and the excess charge on it be @xmath14 .",
    "if the potential on the metal particle is @xmath15 then the electrostatic energy is @xmath16 where @xmath17 for an excess @xmath9 of electrons .",
    "as @xmath15 is increased , electrons will flow from the leads onto the dot , where the potential is lower ( first term in eq .",
    "( [ energyq ] ) ) .",
    "however , opposing this is the large coulomb repulsion between charges on the dot , represented by the small capacitance @xmath18 ( second term ) . at absolute zero",
    ", the total energy will be a minimum which , for this parabolic equation , gives @xmath19 .",
    "however , this is not quite correct since @xmath14 is not a continuous variable : the quantum dot must contain an integral number of electrons .",
    "@xmath9 is thus the integer which makes @xmath20 closest to @xmath21 this is shown in fig .",
    "7a , where we also show the total energy with one extra electron and one fewer electron , corresponding to electron affinity and ionisation respectively .",
    "denoting these energies by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , it follows directly from eqn .",
    "( [ energyq ] ) that @xmath24 furthermore , at @xmath25 the current will be blocked for a very small potential difference between the leads due to the electron affinity and ionisation barriers .",
    "this is the coulomb blockade which can , of course , be overcome at finite temperatures .",
    "its effect is maximal when @xmath26 , as shown in fig.7b , and minimal when there are two dot occupation numbers with exactly the same energy , as shown in fig .",
    "7c . for this latter case",
    ", there will be a `` single - electron current '' even at absolute zero .",
    "hence , this simple model predicts current or conductance oscillations with equidistant peaks separated by @xmath27 , which agrees approximately ( though not precisely ) with experiment .",
    "the model also explains the `` coulomb gap '' shown in fig .",
    "1 , which occurs when the gate voltage is held constant but the voltage between the leads increased . consider the arbitrary case shown in fig .",
    "at absolute zero there will be no current for a potential difference less than @xmath28 .",
    "if the potential on the left lead ( say ) is increased ( _ i.e. _ the potential energy of electrons is lowered ) , then an electron in the dot will eventually have the same energy as the fermi energy in the left lead and a one - electron current will flow from right to left .",
    "this will occur when the potential in the left lead has been raised by @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , starting again with zero potential difference between the leads , if the potential on the right lead is decreased , an electron at the fermi energy will be able to transfer to the dot with no energy penalty when the potential is @xmath30 and a current will flow from right to left .",
    "hence the potential difference between the onsets of left and right currents is @xmath31 this relation can , of course , be used to estimate the effective capacitance in a two - terminal experiment . for observation at @xmath32 or higher temperatures , this effective capacitance has to be very small , @xmath33 .",
    "the semiclassical charging model seems to provide a simple explanation of the main features of quantum dots and their similarity with atoms so do we only need to refine this theory to improve quantitatively the agreement with experiment ? how far can we push the analogy of quantum dots as artificial atoms ?",
    "do they share other features of real atoms , such as a discrete energy spectrum , shell structure , hund s rules etc . ?",
    "there is now significant evidence , both theoretical and experimental , to support the view that there are some fundamental differences between real and artificial atoms .",
    "a simple analysis of the length and energy scales involved indicate that this might be the case . within the parabolic - band effective - mass approximation ,",
    "the natural units of energy and length are the scaled rydberg and bohr radius : @xmath34 these would be , for example , the ground - state binding energy and corresponding bohr radius of a conduction electron bound to a shallow donor ion in a semiconductor .",
    "we show below , a table of these quantities for the semiconductors si , gaas and insb , together with h for comparison .",
    "@xmath35 we see that the energies are typically @xmath36 times less than h with bohr radii @xmath37 times greater ! furthermore , both with real atoms and shallow impurities in semiconductors , the length scale is dictated by the coulomb attraction of the nucleus and the orbiting electrons . for atoms with more than one electron",
    ", this ensures that the kinetic energy remains greater than coulomb repulsion energy between electrons .",
    "for example , in he the mean kinetic energy is almost three times the mean coulomb repulsion energy between the two @xmath38 electrons .",
    "for this reason , the independent electron approximation works very well for atoms .",
    "hartree - fock gives qualitatively the correct picture and even quantitatively errors are only about 5% for light atoms .",
    "for quantum dots , however , the situation can be quite different .",
    "firstly the positive potential which confines electrons is usually much more gradual than the coulomb potential of the atomic nucleus on the scale of the electron wavelength . for large dots , such as those produced by ` soft ' confinement as in systems fabricated on the basis of semiconductor heterojunctions , this will generally be parabolic . for `",
    "hard ' confinement , such as is produced by a heterojunction between two dissimilar semiconductors , the potential can be approximately constant inside the dot .",
    "let us for simplicity consider two electrons in a quantum box with sides of length @xmath39 and infinite barriers .",
    "the one - electron level spacing at low - energies due to kinetic energy is , @xmath40 independent of dimensionality . on the other hand ,",
    "the coulomb repulsion energy between the two electrons is @xmath41 hence @xmath42 where we have used @xmath43 .",
    "this shows that for sufficiently large dots and given electron number , the coulomb repulsion energy between electrons will dominate .",
    "for example , in a gaas quantum dot , coulomb effects are expected to dominate for @xmath44 microns whereas in si this would be about @xmath45 .",
    "we will show in the next section how the relatively large coulomb energy is expected to give rise to qualitatively different physics .",
    "this yields an energy spectrum for the artificial atom which is quite different from that given by the independent electron approximation , due to the correlations between electrons .",
    "however , in the very first experiments on small dots , where the excitation energies are expected to be sufficiently large to be observable , no deviation from the independent - electron picture was detected by means of ( artificial ) atomic ( far infrared ) spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the resolution of this paradox lies in a theorem due to kohn @xcite , which states that the optical spectrum of an interacting electron system which is confined by a parabolic potential is independent of the interactions between electrons for dipole transitions .",
    "this is because the radiation field couples only to the centre - of - mass co - ordinate of all the electrons , the motion of which does not depend on electron - electron interactions .",
    "although , strictly speaking , the confining potentials in quantum dots will not be perfectly parabolic , it turns out in practise that deviations from parabolicity are on the borderline of being observable which makes simple dipole excitations less favourite for probing correlation effects .    the other class of experiments are transport measurements of , for example , electrons tunnelling through a quantum dot in a single - electron transistor @xcite",
    ". however , for the experiments described in section [ experiment ] , which show oscillations in current vs gate voltage for very small source - drain voltage , we do not expect to see a dramatic effect of electron correlations either .",
    "this is because such experiments probe only the interacting ground - states of the quantum dot .",
    "the difference in ground - state energy when the number of electrons on the dot is changed by one in not very small quantum dots is accounted for with reasonable accuracy by the coulomb charging model , which predicts a constant separation between peaks in the conductance oscillations . nevertheless , in very recent experiments , where it has become possible to fabricate quantum dots containing down to @xmath46 electrons and to contact them for transport experiments , significant deviations from the predictions of the simple model have been found , particularly for the first few peaks@xcite .",
    "these deviations can be attributed to correlations .",
    "an even more significant probe would be to look at excited states .",
    "this can be done by simply increasing the source - drain voltage .",
    "in fact , by doing so we may regard the single - electron transistor as an _ energy spectrometer _ for quantum dots / artificial atoms ! that such an experiment can probe",
    "the excited states of the quantum dot can be understood from the following argument , which closely follows that given at the end of section [ charging model ] to explain the coulomb gap .",
    "suppose that at low temperature we adjust the gate voltage of the single - electron transistor just between two conductance oscillation peaks .",
    "let there be @xmath9 electrons on the dot .",
    "suppose that the fermi energy of the drain contact is now lowered by changing its voltage .",
    "eventually the ground - state energy of the @xmath47 electrons will be the same as the ground state energy of @xmath48 electrons on the dot plus an electron at the fermi energy in the drain lead .",
    "this will cause a current to flow as an electron may leave the dot allowing another electron to enter it from the source lead .",
    "however , the _ magnitude _ of this current will depend strongly on the position of the fermi energy in the source contact .",
    "if this is such that @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the ground - state energy of the @xmath48 electrons on the dot and @xmath51 is the first excited state of @xmath9 electrons on the dot , then the current will be due ( only ) to electrons in the source at energy @xmath52 @xmath53 tunnelling into the dot . however , when @xmath54 there are now two channels for tunnelling into the dot , _",
    "i.e. _ electrons at the fermi energy and electrons at energy @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "hence , at this point there will be a sudden rise in current .",
    "these steps of increasing current occur whenever @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is an excited state with @xmath9 electrons .",
    "hence there will be a fine structure at either side of the coulomb gap reflecting the energy level structure of the dot @xcite .",
    "this has indeed been observed in experiments that show a rich structure of resonance steps corresponding to excited states @xcite .",
    "they also show some unusual features which can not be explained by an independent - electron picture , such _ negative differential resistance_. as we shall see in the next section , this kind of unusual behaviour is indeed expected for strongly correlated electrons on the quantum dot .",
    "it is well known that electrons interacting via coulomb repulsion in a uniform background of positive charge behave quite differently in the high and low density limits . at relatively high densities comparable with that in real metals , the kinetic energy dominates and , despite the still large coulomb repulsion , the system at low - energies may be mapped onto an independent - electron model of weakly interacting quasiparticles.@xcite at low - densities this picture is not even qualitatively correct .",
    "the potential energy ( coulomb repulsion ) dominates over kinetic energy and the electrons eventually form a lattice @xcite , with low - lying excitations that are lattice vibrations @xcite ( see also the article by ando , fowler and stern @xcite ) .",
    "this occurs for a mean separation between neighbouring electrons @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the effective bohr radius ( denoted by @xmath59 in the previous section ) . for intermediate densities ,",
    "this is an extremely difficult problem due to competing interactions from the quasi - classical ` lattice ' vibrations and quantum mechanical exchange .",
    "physical realisation of the wigner lattice is an extremely challenging experimental problem due to the difficulty in obtaining a low - defect region with sufficiently low electron density .",
    "nevertheless evidence of wigner crystallisation has been reported in heterostructures @xcite .    with large quantum dots , we have the interesting possibility of the analogue of wigner crystallisation for finite systems with just a few electrons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the infinite system , not only might the density  density correlation function crystallize but also the charge density distribution itself , with the electrons occupying energetically favourable positions within the dot . this can indeed be the case as we shall see , with the geometry of the confining region being crucial to the nature of the few - electron states in two and three dimensions . by analogy with the wigner lattice ,",
    "these quantum dot systems with large mean separation between electrons have been called wigner molecules @xcite .",
    "one theoretical advantage of studying few - electron systems is that they have the prospect of essentially being solved exactly by direct numerical diagonalisation of the hamiltonian matrix @xcite .",
    "it turns out that they are also amenable to approximations which are not valid for large systems ( see below ) .",
    "such approximations are still necessary , for although we are interested in a few - electron problem ( with @xmath9 @xmath60 ) , it is prohibitively expensive on computer time to solve for more than a very few electrons by direct diagonalisation . for sufficient accuracy , the practical limit is @xmath61 in one dimension and @xmath62 in two dimensions . for high density systems we can",
    ", of course , get reasonable results with the independent - electron model using the hartree - fock approximation , for which solutions with tens of electrons are easily obtained @xcite .",
    "however , this is a poor approximation when the mean electron separation is large and gives qualitatively incorrect results .",
    "this may be seen from exact diagonalisations for a one - dimensional quantum dot with a simple rectangular well confining potential @xcite .",
    "we summarise the main results of these computations in figs . 8 and 9 .",
    "figure 8 shows the energy spectrum for @xmath63 to @xmath64 for a well width @xmath65 .",
    "this is seen to consist of a series of multiplets for which the energy separation between multiplets is much greater than the energy splitting within a multiplet .",
    "furthermore we can easily see that this spectrum is qualitatively different from that which would be given by an independent - electron picture by examining the lowest multiplet with @xmath62 electrons . in the independent - electron picture",
    ", we expect a doublet lowest followed further doublets at energies @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( relative to the ground - state ) and an octet at energy @xmath68 etc . , where @xmath69 are the one - electron levels .",
    "instead we see a low - lying multiplet consisting of doublet , doublet , quartet with very small splitting between them ( @xmath70 ) , followed by a ( relatively ) very large gap to another multiplet of closely spaced levels . a clue as to what is causing this level structure",
    "is found in fig .",
    "9 where the charge density due to all three electrons in the ground - state of the interacting system is plotted for various @xmath39 .",
    "these curves are qualitatively different for large and small @xmath39 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "we get a charge density characteristic of the independent - electron picture , since this would place two electrons in the nodeless ground - state and the third electron in the first excited state with a node at @xmath72 , giving a shallow minimum in the total electron density . at the other extreme , with @xmath73 ,",
    "we see three distinct peaks .",
    "this is close to what we would expect in the ` wigner limit ' , where the electrons arrange themselves with equal separation in order to minimise the electrostatic energy .",
    "this quasi - classical configuration is essentially spin - independent , as can be seen from the corresponding ground - state multiplet which is almost ( but not quite ) degenerate .",
    "these results are not unexpected . what is less obvious is the behaviour at smaller @xmath39 , where we see a persistence of the wigner picture down to rather small @xmath39 , the three peaks being discernable even when @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _ mean electron separation of order @xmath58 )",
    "furthermore , an examination of the energy spectrum shows that the ground - manifold spin - multiplet , with @xmath75 states , remains well separated from higher - lying multiplets as @xmath39 is reduced .",
    "the main effect is to increase rapidly the magnitude of the splitting within the ground - state multiplet as @xmath39 is decreased whilst ( approximately ) preserving their ratio of order @xmath76 .",
    "we see a similar behaviour for @xmath77 with a ground - manifold spin - multiplet of dimension @xmath78 , which splits into two singlets , three triplets and a quintet .    in the infinite system the low - lying excitations are sound waves in the wigner limit when the spin can be ignored , since the electrons become distinguishable through their respective lattice sites .",
    "indeed , this is what makes the problem prohibitively difficult at higher densities where the fermi statistics of the electrons can no longer be ignored .",
    "the major simplification of the few - electron system is that these sound - wave - like excitations are high in energy compared to low - energy spin - splittings and can therefore be safely ignored @xcite , thus permitting the effect of the fermi statistics to be examined in isolation as @xmath39 decreases .",
    "this is similar to the situation in real molecules , where the separation between vibrational levels is greater than the fine - structure due to electron interactions .",
    "( whereas in crystalline solids both lattice vibrations and electronic excitations are present in the low - energy spectrum . )",
    "in the remainder of this section we will concentrate mainly on the low - energy manifold of states for quantum dots in both one and two dimensions .",
    "consider again the simplest non - trivial case of two electrons in a one - dimensional rectangular well , interacting via a potential of the form @xmath79 this has the usual coulomb form for large separations between the electrons and passes through a maximum when the @xmath80coordinates coincide .",
    "it models a quasi-1d quantum dot , the parameter @xmath81 representing the confinement in the other two dimensions , with @xmath81 decreasing as the confinement increases .",
    "we may regard this two - electron problem in 1d as a single - particle problem in 2d with momentum * p*=(@xmath82 ) and position * r*=(@xmath83 ) . the potential landscape for this fictitious particle , @xmath84",
    "is shown in fig . 10 where we see potential minima at @xmath85 and @xmath86 , corresponding to the two positions where the ` real ' particles ( electrons ) are maximally separated . when viewed in this way , the problem is reminiscent of a tunnelling problem in which the particle may start in one well , or ` pocket ' and will subsequently tunnel to the other .",
    "to describe this situation quantitatively we may choose basis states for the particle in each well .",
    "these may be constructed , for example , by replacing the potential energy in region 2 of fig .",
    "10 by the maximum value @xmath87 and solving for the eigenstates in region 1 , @xmath88 say .",
    "similarly for the well states in region 2 , @xmath89 .",
    "now , if the barrier of the true potential ( fig .",
    "10 ) is sufficiently strong then , to a good approximation , there will be two low - lying states @xmath90 with corresponding energies @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . furthermore , these eigenstates will be well separated from higher - lying states . to complete the picture , we must impose the indistinguishability of the underlying electrons on these solutions .",
    "this is straightforward since we know that the symmetric solution , @xmath95 , corresponds to a spin singlet and the antisymmetric solution , @xmath96 , to a spin triplet .",
    "the important point about the above analysis is that we may deduce the nature of the low - lying states without explicitly solving the problem , provided we can justify the neglect higher lying states in each well .",
    "this is indeed the case for the potential given in eqn.[v2 ] .",
    "it is emphasised that the base states themselves are highly correlated and can not in general be approximated by a simple product of one - electron wavefunctions .",
    "we may extend this ` pocket state ' analysis to cases with more electrons and higher dimensions .",
    "thus @xmath9 electrons in @xmath97 dimensions is equivalent to a single particle in a @xmath98 dimensional space .",
    "this fictitious particle will move in a potential landscape with at least @xmath99 minima corresponding to the classical minimum electrostatic energy of the @xmath9 electrons regarded as distinguishable ( though equivalent ) . in two and three dimensions there may be more minima for certain geometries .",
    "for example , consider 3 electrons in a square dot .",
    "the electrons will be repelled to the corners of the square and there will be four different configurations corresponding to one corner unoccupied and the remaining 3 occupied .",
    "hence there will be @xmath100 classical minima . in the general case",
    "there will be @xmath101 equivalent global minima .",
    "provided these are well separated in energy from possible higher local minima then the structure of the low - lying eigenstates may again be deduced from the hamiltonian matrix of the system within the basis of the @xmath101 pocket states of lowest energy .",
    "for @xmath102 the requirement that the true eigenstates be antisymmetric with respect to interchange of both position and spin is not trivial since , unlike the case of @xmath103 , the ` orbital ' part of the wavefunction will be neither symmetric nor antisymmetric .",
    "however , the problem may be solved using the theory of permutation groups and the corresponding low - lying spectrum deduced @xcite .",
    "the pocket state analysis suggests an alternative approach to the few - electron quantum dot problem which is similar to that used for strongly correlated lattice systems .",
    "the generic theoretical model for such lattice problems is the hubbard model .",
    "this has been successful in modelling mott insulators , the metal - insulator transition and , more recently , doped mott insulators , which are believed to be relevant to the copper - oxide planes of high - temperature superconductors in which the physics is believed to be dominated by electron - electron correlations.@xcite we can indeed show that this model is relevant to interacting electrons in a quantum dot but let us first review the main properties of the hubbard model .",
    "the hubbard model is essentially a tight - binding model in which only the largest coulomb matrix elements are retained .",
    "consider , for example , a collection of one - electron atoms which are essentially in fixed positions but otherwise quite general ( molecule , crystalline solid or disordered solid ) .",
    "following hubbard @xcite we approximate this system by confining the hilbert space to just one orbital per atom and drop all coulomb matrix elements except the largest , which corresponds to two electrons of opposite spin on the same site ( atom ) .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 is a one - electron energy for atom @xmath108 , @xmath109 is a hopping matrix element from atom @xmath108 to atom @xmath110 and @xmath111 is a coulomb matrix element for two electrons on atom @xmath108 . in this equation ,",

    "( [ tjvmodel ] ) . for the quantum dot ,",
    "the exchange parameters @xmath124 are relatively very small and on the scale of @xmath120 and @xmath15 they may be dropped . in some cases the @xmath15 may also be dropped since it merely gives rise to an overall energy shift .",
    "for example , three electrons in a two dimensional quantum dot of square symmetry .",

    "this effective hamiltonian is easily diagonalised .",
    "the spectrum consists of two singlets and two triplets .",
    "we see immediately that ( [ two ] ) gives zero",
    "when operating on a spin - polarised state and hence the triplets are at zero energy with the singlets at energies @xmath152 , in agreement with what is obtained from the pocket state approximation for this problem when the exchange of the two electrons is included there @xcite .",
    "there are thus two contributions to the ` binding energy ' of the singlet ground state , a resonance energy ( @xmath153 and a superexchange energy ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the former will be dominant since it occurs in second - order and does not involve double - occupation of a ` site ' . on the other hand , there are two contributions to @xmath136 , the second - order term @xmath155 and fourth - order terms @xmath156 .",
    "the cases of four and five electrons on a square reduce directly to an effective heisenberg model and the corresponding spectra are shown in fig .",

    "this is easily understood from the heisenberg model which , due to the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , will tend to align adjacent spins antiparallel . with 4 electrons",

    "( note that the exchange interaction between electrons on neighbouring corners will oppose this tendency to parallel alignment but , since the distance is a factor @xmath159 greater than to the centre , this ` frustration ' is insufficient to enforce low - spin . )    this difference in the nature of the ground states for 4 and 5 electrons in a square dot has important consequences for single - electron transport .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "14 where we consider a situation where the ground state energy of the dot with 5 electrons is exactly degenerate with that of 4 electrons in their ground state and one electron at the fermi energy in a lead .",
    "( we assume that the source - drain voltage is vanishingly small . ) strictly speaking , these states can not be connected by a tunnelling interaction at @xmath25 since this is forbidden by conservation of spin , _",
    "i.e. _ to be allowed the total spin @xmath160 on the dot may only differ by @xmath161 when the electron number fluctuates by one .",
    "this phenomena is known as _ spin blockade _",
    "@xcite since , if we imagine starting in the coulomb blockade regime with 4 electrons on the dot in their ground - state with energy @xmath162 ( where @xmath163 is the ground - state energy with 5 electrons ) , and raise the energy of @xmath164 ( via the gate voltage ) , then the current through the dot will be spin - blocked even when @xmath165 . by further raising the energy of the electrons on the dot relative to the fermi energy ,",
    "the single - electron current will eventually be ` switched on ' when the @xmath166 states with 5 electrons become degenerate with @xmath167 .",
    "a finite conductance may also be recovered from the spin - blockade regime by either raising the temperature , when excited states with @xmath166 again become involved , or by increasing the source - drain voltage , which has a similar effect .",
    "these effects are generic in the sense that they will apply to a variety of quantum - dot geometries ( either contrived or accidental ) . in this way",
    "the ` recovery ' of ` missing ' conductance peaks when heating the sample up to 500 mk , as observed in @xcite , can be interpreted by such a spin blockade phenomenon @xcite .",
    "although the above equivalence of a few - electron quantum - dot system to hubbard / charge - spin models is adequate for most situations , there is one further class of problem for which it breaks down .",
    "these are problems with very high symmetry in which processes involving the simultaneous movement of more than two electrons can be important or even dominant in comparison to processes where just two neighbouring electrons are exchanged . a simple example would be an ( almost ) circular dot that contains a very small number ( @xmath168 ) of electrons and is sufficiently large that the mean separation between electrons exceeds the bohr radius . in the classical wigner limit",
    "there are low - energy states in which all @xmath9 electrons arrange themselves around the periphery of the dot and rotate whilst preserving their relative separations .",
    "this indicates that the corresponding elementary permutational process , a cyclic exchange of all electron places , is connected with a larger probability amplitude than the exchange of two nearest neighbours .",
    "this affects considerably the spin multiplets at low energies .",
    "for example , an odd electron number favours a high - spin ground - state while @xmath157 for @xmath9 even .",
    "another example where ` higher order ' permutations processes could be important is inside the bulk of an extended wigner crystal ( or , a large dot containing many electrons at low - density ) where the electrons arrange themselves in the form of an ( almost ) hexagonal lattice .",
    "there , @xmath169 rotations of any of the electron triangles composing the lattice could well be of similar importance to the pair exchange of adjacent electrons .",
    "can the hubbard / charge - spin models be modified to accommodate these processes ?",
    "the answer is yes and in fact similar processes can also be important for lattice systems , though this is not well - kown .",
    "an example of the latter is a contribution to the superexchange between two holes in the copper - oxide planes of the high temperature superconductors in which the holes never occupy the same sites simultaneously.@xcite for the quantum dot , we may illustrate these processes by considering a triangular quantum dot . by introducing intermediate lattice points",
    ", we can rotate all 3 electron through @xmath169 in a series of 6 steps as shown in fig .",
    "the intermediate steps are higher in energy than the initial and final states ( the electrostatic coulomb energy is higher ) and may be eliminated by perturbation theory .",
    "the result is an effective interaction of the form @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is a constant energy and @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) is an operator which performs a cyclic ( anticyclic ) rotation of all three electrons .",
    "we note that these rotation operators may be written as spin - operators using the identities , @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the dirac exchange operator .",
    "hence , expressing the exchange term in eq .",
    "( [ tjvmodel ] ) in terms of these permutation operators and dropping an overall constant energy , the effective spin - hamiltonian for 3 electrons in an equilateral triangular potential well becomes , @xmath176 -k(p_{12}p_{23}+p_{23}p_{12})\\quad.\\ ] ] we see immediately from this form that the spin polarised state has eigenenergy @xmath177 .",
    "it is straightforward to complete the diagonalisation of @xmath178 which results in a further pair of degenerate doublets at energy @xmath179 .",
    "we refer to the @xmath171-term as a ` ring ' term and we see that it opposes the exchange ( @xmath136 ) terms , with the former favouring a high  spin ground state and the latter a low  spin ground state .",
    "the crossover occurs at @xmath180 , which is not quite reached for the equilateral triangle , as discussed above",
    ".    this will not always be so for other geometries as follows immediately from the fact that we can change the shape of the dot in such a way that the ring processes are increased in amplitude relative to the exchange processes , as shown , for example , in fig .",
    "an ` extreme ' example of this is the circular dot ( fig .",
    "16c ) which , as discussed earlier , has a spin polarised ground - state ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the transition from high - spin to low - spin ground states in rings with increasing impurity barrier has been discussed recently in the context of persistent currents.@xcite    in summary , we have shown in this section how the low - density few - electron problem in a quantum dot may be mapped onto a hubbard model and that this may be further reduced to a charge - spin model . in one dimension",
    "we always get an effective heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic exchange and a low - spin ground state . in higher dimensions",
    "there are other possibilities which depend upon dot geometry and the number of electrons .",
    "this can have a dramatic effect on the nature of the energy spectrum , both for the ordering of the states and the energy scale of the separations between levels .",
    "for geometries in which there is only one electrostatic configuration in the classical limit , the degeneracy due to the permutation of electrons on different ` lattice sites ' is partly lifted by quantum mechanical exchange described by an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model . in this cases there",
    "is just one energy scale for the splitting between multiplets , the exchange energy @xmath136 .",
    "note , however that in more than one dimension the ground state spin can be larger than minimum , an example being 5 electrons in a square .",
    "in other situations , where there is more than one classical electrostatic configuration of lowest energy , the energy separations of multiplets may be quite different .",
    "for example , for 3 electrons ( 1 hole ) in a square there will be energy splittings on both the scale of @xmath120 and of @xmath136 , with @xmath133 and , furthermore , the ground - state will be high spin .",
    "the so - called ` ring ' processes can also be important .",
    "these effectively represent the simultaneous cyclic permutation of more than two electrons and have a characteristic energy scale @xmath171 .",
    "for the example of 3 electrons in a triangle , @xmath171 approaches the rotational constant @xmath181 of a perfect circular dot of circumference @xmath39 , as the triangle is distorted into a circle , when there will be energy spilittings on the scale of both @xmath171 and @xmath136 , with a crossover from low - spin to high - spin ground state .",
    "more complicated situations can be envisaged as the number of electrons is increased .",
    "thus , for example , 7 electrons in a square dot will have a classical ground - state configuration with four electrons in the corners of the dot and the remaining three forming a triangle in the interior of the dot .",
    "important quantum mechanical processes will include pair exchange and ` ring ' processes in which the three interior electrons will perform ` rigid ' rotations of @xmath182 .",
    "future work could investigate these processes in more detail and estimate their relative magnitudes using quasi - classical methods , in addition to investigating other geometries which show promise for device applications .",
    "the science of quantum dots and artificial atoms is still very much in its infancy and we can expect many new developments in the forthcoming years as technological advances permit reliable and reproducible fabrication of device structures . from the present perspective , a number of areas with both fundamental and applications potential seem worthy of further investigation .",
    "single dots which are not too small offer the possibility of investigating in a controlled way both the wigner ` lattice ' and the transition from the wigner regime to the independent electron ( quasiparticle ) regime as the electron number and mean electron density is increased . as disussed in the previous section",
    ", the fundamental difference between the wigner regime in a ` few - electron ' quantum dot and the infinte wigner lattice is the major effect of the boundaries that can increase the ground state spin to values greater than @xmath157 or @xmath166 , and provides a separation of the energy scales related to ` vibrational ' and spin degrees of freedom , respectively . in principle , this opens two possible scenarios towards the wigner transition .",
    "firstly , we can increase the system size whilst maintaining a sufficiently low but constant density to bring the excited vibrational states closer to the ground manifold .",
    "they eventually will mix with the spin states which changes the low energy physics qualitatively . on the other hand , we can imagine to increasing the confinement with a constant number of electrons .",
    "this will suppress the ( effective ) spin dependence of the low energy states and leave the quantum dot with classical electrons , in analogy to the transition from the heitler - london to the molecular orbital picture in molecules .",
    "this crossover is also related to the metal - insulator ( mott ) transition which can take place in strongly correlated lattice systems .",
    "another area worthy of further investigation is the magnetic field dependence in the wigner regime .",
    "large magnetic fields modify the low energy eigenstates considerably @xcite , as it is observed also experimentally in quantum dots @xcite . however , as a pure quantum effect even a non - vanishing vector potential ( which does not require a magnetic field at the location of the electrons at all ) can have very interesting consequences .",
    "one famous example is that of finite currents circulating around a small ring due to the aharonov ",
    "bohm flux @xmath183 enclosed by the ring ( which is an equilibrium effect , in contrast to superconducting currents  ! ) .",
    "it is known that electron ",
    "electron interactions are important , otherwise the experimentally observed magnitudes of the currents can not be understood .",
    "theoretically , this problem can be approached by considering a one - dimensional quantum dot , such as that described in section  [ theory ] , deforming it to form a ring .",
    "the electron molecule can then rotate ( almost ) freely , maintaining the distances between the electrons .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath7 and , most importantly , the ground state spin @xmath160 , can then be determined in a similar way to that described in section  [ theory ] @xcite .",
    "however , they depend now on @xmath183 .",
    "this determines the persistent current that is proportional to the derivative @xmath184 ( at zero temperature ) .",
    "since even impurities along the ring do not cause level repulsion between energies belonging to different spin values @xmath160 and @xmath185 , the persistent current can exhibit discontinuous jumps near values for the flux where level crossings occur .",
    "in disordered rings this would not occur for spinless electrons .",
    "the magnitude of the persistent current indeed increases with increasing interaction strength .",
    "the main shortcoming of this model of a very thin , one - channel ring is that it can not explain values of the current observed experimentally , which correspond to almost freely circulating electrons .",
    "@xcite . however , it has became clear that maximum persistent currents in disordered rings require the investiation of wider , many channel rings . for any description within the picture of wigner localized electrons",
    "this means that we need to increase the electron number in the ring considerably .",
    "this is only feasible using an approach that is highly selective in the hilbert space describing the low - energy physics .",
    "the spin - charge representation described in section  [ theory ] should provide a means of achieving this .",
    "there are many new effects to be investigated in multiple quantum dots and quantum dots arrays , _",
    "i.e. _ artificial molecules and solids . unlike their ` real ' counterparts",
    ", they have the prospect of being controlled in a well defined way as technology advances .",
    "thus , for example , we have the prospect of studying the classic mott transition @xcite for an array of one - electron artificial atoms as the ratio of the tunnelling matrix element between dots to the coulomb charging energy is varied .",
    "another way of inducing a metal - insulator transition is to change the number of electrons on each artificial atom by simply varying the chemical potential through gate voltages .",
    "the insulator to metal transition occurs when the fermi energy exceeds the minimum tunnelling barrier between dots and a dot array becomes an ` antidot ' array.@xcite the ` insulating ' regime of such an array of one - electron artificial atoms would be interesting in its own right since , as with real atoms , we might expect an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between neighbouring dots . with more electrons / dot we could ` engineer ' artificial atoms with high - spin ground states ( by choice of dot geometry and electron number )",
    ". these would give rise to magnetic correlations between dots and could , in principle introduce magnetic low energy modes and , eventually , magnetically ordered phases at sufficiently low temperatures . more generally , in the long - term we can invisage ` designer ' molecules and solids with desired properties ( energy structure , band structure , conductivity , susceptibility , anisotropy etc . ) !    finally , we may speculate on the feasibility of practical applications of quantum dots , single - electron transistors etc .",
    "the main obstacle to their widespread use for electronic applications is the need for low - temperatures .",
    "the temperature scale is ultimately set by the size of the quantum dot and , in principle , there is no fundamental reason why devices should not be made sufficiently small to operate at room temperature or higher .",
    "indeed , there has been a great deal of progress over the past five years during which we have seen the temperature of operation of single - electron transistors increase from 4k to 77k , with evidence for oscillations in conductance due to single - electron tunnelling being discernible even at room temperature.@xcite similar evidence for room - temperature , single - electron memory devices has also been reported recently.@xcite there is little doubt that this progess will continue with the relentless drive towards smaller structures as nanoelectronics approaches the molecular level . with the need for ever increasing levels of integration and low - power consumption",
    "there is also little doubt as to the potential markets for single electronics , though the formidable technological problems associated with reproducibility and fabrication on the nanoscale should not be underestimated .",
    "other promising areas for quantum dot arrays and quantum wires are optical applications , particularly low - threshold lasers . here again the key issues at present are technological , with the need to reproduce devices with a small variance in size . despite these difficulties",
    ", recent progress is encouraging and prospects are good for the use of quantum dots and artificial atoms to investigate fundamental physics and the development of new device concepts into the twenty - first century .",
