    "exoskeletons , long an idea of science fiction , have the potential to change day - to - day life for countless individuals , especially those with mobility issues .",
    "while approximately 70% of people with spinal cord injury ( sci ) paraplegia use a manual wheel - chair  @xcite , being seated for extended periods creates a variety of other medical concerns such as degradation of bone density  @xcite , muscle atrophy  @xcite , and pressure sores  @xcite , in addition to requiring special infrastructure adaptations such as ramps and lifts to conduct activities of daily life . to address this , commercial exoskeletons such as rewalk  @xcite , ekso  @xcite , and indego  @xcite",
    "have made significant strides forward since the first prototypes .",
    "indeed , the recent 2016 cybathlon illustrated the incredible progress that exoskeletons have made in recent years , with many capable of ascending and descending stairs and ramps .",
    "however , while the cybathlon included tasks of daily living , they were presented in an idealized situation , far from what one would encounter in the real world . realistically , there are not always handrails , steps are of different heights , and surrounding crowds interfere with crutch placement , to highlight a few differences . though several of the pilots were able to complete most of the challenges , the cybathlon thoroughly demonstrated how far exoskeletons have to go before pilots are able to walk with the speed and ease of able - bodied persons .",
    "a variety of exoskeletons have been developed for improving mobility .",
    "the rewalk was one of the first such devices to show the potential for restoring ambulation for those limited to a wheelchair .",
    "three exoskeletons in the united states , rewalk  @xcite , ekso  @xcite , and indego  @xcite , have been approved by the fda for use as rehabilitation devices on flat ground .",
    "each of these devices have demonstrated sit - to - stand capabilities , with rewalk leading the way with the ability to ascend and descend stairs .",
    "all three platforms feature motors at the hips and knees to power the leg motions .",
    "each one executes a position trajectory at the command of the pilot , triggered by either a body tilt or button press , to perform the walking motion . from observations",
    ", the rewalk and ekso will also prematurely stop this stepping motion if ground contact is detected .",
    "additionally , the rewalk can command different step types through a wrist mounted interface .",
    "while walking and standing , however , all of the balance and stability is provided by the pilot through the use of forearm crutches .",
    "overall , the mobility capabilities of even these most advanced devices is limited to rehabilitation centers or home use .",
    "we previously developed the mina v1",
    "@xcite and nasa x1  @xcite ( in collaboration with nasa ) exoskeletons .",
    "similar to the three commercial devices , these two exoskeletons feature actuators at the hips and knees : harmonic drive reduced dc motors for mina v1  @xcite , and custom rotary series elastic actuators ( seas ) on x1 .",
    "seas were also used by the university of twente in the design of lopes , a gait training exoskeleton that operates by setting joint impedances for the hips and knees using custom bowden - cable seas to adjust the user s gait  @xcite . for rehabilitation ,",
    "controlling the impedance allows adjustment of the amount of assistance the device provides , leading to potentially effective therapies . additionally , impedance control is now the standard actuation approach for legged robotics , as it enables compliant interactions with the environment . for mobility assistance ,",
    "impedance control thus offers the potential to have powered exoskeletons provide locomotion on par with humanoid robots .    despite trying to restore upright sagittal plane mobility ,",
    "powered exoskeletons have differed from their biological counterparts in one , what we believe to be , critical way : the lack of ankle actuation .",
    "able - bodied walking relies on the motion and forces exerted by ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion . during flat walking , farris et al . showed that approximately 4050% of positive power is provided by the ankle joint .",
    "it was found , however , that as much as 40% of the positive work done by the entire leg during walking comes from the ankle muscle - tendon system  @xcite . despite this",
    ", powered ankle plantar flexion is rare in powered exoskeletons .",
    "indeed , the most common powered exoskeletons , rewalk  @xcite , ekso  @xcite and indego  @xcite do not have powered ankles , but instead opt for a passive , spring loaded joint .    while there have been many powered exoskeletons that include powered ankles , these are typically ankle - only exoskeletons for data collection  @xcite or specific orthotic purposes  @xcite , or augmentation exoskeletons  @xcite . to explore the effects of ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion on exoskeleton systems ,",
    "we have designed a new exoskeleton , mina v2 , pictured in .",
    "mina v2 includes powered hip flexion / extension , knee flexion , and , notably , powered ankle dorsiflexion / plantar flexion .",
    "mina v2 was then utilized as our entrant into the 2016 cybathlon . the powered exoskeleton competition in the cybathlon consisted of a variety of tasks , including a slalom course , ascending and descending a ramp that is not compliant with the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) , navigating a tilted path , ascending and descending a set of stairs , and traversing a set of stepping stones , in addition to sitting down and standing up from a seat . in this work",
    ", we present the strategies that we developed for these tasks .",
    "our approach centered around using powered ankle - flexion to reduce the required pilot effort as much as possible , by including powered toe - off motions in the trajectories .",
    "differing from many other exoskeleton gait designs , we present a walking gait that utilizes a transfer phase which includes a large degree of toe - off . we also present our approaches to the other tasks that capitalize on our powered ankle plantarflexion . to increase the flexibility of the walking gait",
    ", we also developed a unique method for finding joint position trajectories based on defining cartesian waypoints for the swing foot .",
    "we believe that the use of toe - off combined with flexible trajectory design was critical to our team s success in the 2016 cybathlon .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "provides an overview of the design of the mina v2 exoskeleton .",
    "we highlight our approaches for the different motion tasks in .",
    "we outline the method the pilot uses to interface with the exoskeleton . in we present experimental results obtained using this approach for flat walking , stair ascension , and stepping stones , as well as several observations made by our pilot .",
    "we close out this article with a discussion on the results , and a summary of conclusions we can draw on the benefits of the inclusion of powered ankles in powered exoskeletons .",
    "designed as our entry to the 2016 cybathlon , mina v2 is the latest exoskeleton developed by ihmc .",
    "this design drew on our experience with the design and manufacture of mina v1",
    "@xcite , the nasa x1 exoskeleton  @xcite and the hopper exercise exoskeleton  @xcite , and will be overviewed in the following section .",
    "a complimentary work describing the hardware in more detail is being prepared .",
    "mina v2 features a fully custom , carbon composite design .",
    "the device includes six electric actuators , which are integrated into the structure as load bearing components , and a protective backpack for electronics .",
    "mina v2 functions as a prototype device , designed and built to custom dimensions specifically to fit our pilot .",
    "the actuators themselves are custom linear linkage actuators ( llas ) , which are modular in construction , allowing for ease of replacement , accessibility , and repair .",
    "they were designed in - house , specifically for use with mina v2 , and feature a frameless electric motor , integrated electronics , and an onboard motor amplifier and controller for distributed joint - level control .",
    "the structure of the actuator uses a slider - crank linkage mechanism driven by a linear ball screw transmission .",
    "the slider - crank mechanics are tuned and optimized to produce the highest torque and gear ratio for the desired range of motion . in the current application ,",
    "the lla produces approximately @xmath1 torque about the point of rotation with a @xmath2 range of motion .    to house the actuators ,",
    "each link of the device is a custom manufactured composite piece .",
    "the link structure is first designed and 3d - printed as an abs plastic mold .",
    "the mold is used to maintain internal tolerances while layers of carbon fiber weave and unidirectional cloth are laid over it .",
    "epoxy resin is then vacuum infused into the cloth .",
    "once the epoxy cured , the joint structures are demolded and post processed to fit .",
    "this utilization of carbon fiber components keeps the total exoskeleton mass to @xmath3 .",
    "each actuator is equipped with a magnetic incremental encoder on the motor , magnetic absolute encoder on the output , and load cell on the output of the linkage .",
    "the motor is controlled by an elmo motion twitter gold motor drive capable of performing position , velocity , and current control , depending on the desired control mode .",
    "the motor drive is mounted on a custom carrier board that breaks out the connections for the encoders and the load cell .",
    "central control is performed on an embedded com express type 6 computer running a custom ubuntu kernel .",
    "the control code runs on a java vm using posix real - time threads through a custom library .",
    "the embedded computer communicates with the motor drivers over ethercat .",
    "the ethercat line is split into two separate lines by an omron ethercat junction , allowing for more efficient wiring of the legs .",
    "this omron junction also allows connection of other ethercat enabled sensors , such as an imu .",
    "mina v2 is powered by a @xmath4 , @xmath5 lithium ion battery designed for electric bicycles , and is capable of approximately 2.5 hours of runtime .",
    "the battery has an onboard battery management system to protect from current overdraw and under voltage conditions .",
    "a wireless emergency stop and secondary wired emergency stop are included to interrupt motor power in the case of an error .",
    "watchdogs also monitor communications with the motor controllers and can disable the controller if needed .",
    "mina v2 was designed to explore the effects of including powered ankle plantar flexion on an orthotic robotic exoskeleton . as such",
    ", the trajectories are designed around the use of this additional degree of freedom .",
    "the addition of powered ankle plantar flexion allows the trailing leg to apply greater forces to the ground when walking and performing other functions .",
    "this section describes the details for calculating the desired trajectories , which exploit the described toe - off action .      to increase the flexibility of the walking gait , we designed the swing leg trajectory in task - space , making it a function of cartesian waypoints .",
    "we defined four cartesian waypoints with corresponding spatial velocities : the starting location , the desired ending location , and two middle waypoints , as illustrated in .",
    "these midpoints were defined at a tuneable percent of the step length , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and a desired swing height , @xmath8 , in .",
    "we then used inverse kinematics to solve for the necessary hip and knee angles and velocities at the trajectory knots , and set this as the boundary conditions for minimum - jerk joint trajectories .",
    "this approach for calculating swing joint leg angles was used for all the tasks in the cybathlon , from flat ground walking to stairs to slopes . by defining the trajectories in this fashion , changing step lengths and times",
    "did not require additional effort beyond changing the final goal position and the total trajectory time .",
    "not only did this ease the development effort when the pilot was learning to use the exoskeleton , it also accelerated the training process , as all tuning could be done online rather than in code changes .",
    "additionally , it required only one code module for calculating joint trajectories , rather than separate code for each different task of the cybathlon .      in natural , able - bodied walking",
    ", ankle plantar - flexion is used to inject energy into the system , starting at the end of the swing phase and continuing through transfer  @xcite . to more closely emulate this",
    ", we introduced a toe - off motion during a short transfer phase at the beginning of every step .",
    "this motion consisted of commanding a minimum - jerk trajectory ending at a certain angle to the trailing ankle during transfer .",
    "this corresponded with a change in the leading leg hip flexion as the body rotated about the leading ankle , in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "an additional , fast toe - off motion was added at the beginning of the swing phase to impart an additional impulse to the system , as shown in ( c ) .",
    "it was found that this toe - off motion worked very well , helping when walking continuously , and providing considerable assistance to the pilot when starting walking from a rest .",
    "this was a common situation , as the lack of hip internal / external rotation required a style of ambulation , needing frequent pauses to reposition .",
    "the stepping stones were particularly aided by powered toe - off , as the need for precise foot placement required stopping between each step , leading to the long stance length requiring considerable effort by the pilot to start walking .      to make stair ascension easier for our pilot",
    ", we designed joint trajectories to capitalize on the ability to use powered ankle plantar flexion .",
    "uniquely , we did not take steps one at a time , as other exoskeletons typically do , instead stepping with only foot on each step .",
    "our approach for stair ascension is outlined in . between steps",
    ", the hips are positioned evenly between the feet , and then moved directly over the leading ankle before stepping up , as shown in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the goal is to move the center of mass directly over the leading ankle , making balancing easier for the pilot , and having all actuator work go into raising the center of mass .",
    "this motion is combined with significant toe - off , so that the center of mass will begin to be raised during transfer when both legs are on the ground .",
    "we found that by including this motion , the required torque at the upcoming support knee was greatly decreased .",
    "this , in turn , results in less effort on the pilot . similar to our toe - off strategy during flat walking , we added an additional , fast toe - off motion at the end of the transfer phase to add an impulse to the system , shown in ( c ) .",
    "similar to the other tasks , the trajectories we designed for ascending and descending the ramp revolved around the usage of powered ankle plantar flexion . for ascending , we used the same approach as in flat ground walking , except we desired the hips to be only slightly in front of the trailing foot at the start of transfer . for descending , we similarly wanted the hips over or only slightly in front of the trailing foot . also when descending , there was no additional fast toe - off motion at the end of transfer .",
    "this approach is outlined in .",
    "the human machine interface for mina v2 is based on manual input by the pilot .",
    "it consists of a raspberry pi 3 computer with a screen , thumb joystick and a momentary switch ; all mounted to the right crutch .",
    "the joystick is integrated in the front facing part of the handle and the switch is mounted on the bottom of the handle as a trigger .",
    "the hmi runs off a separate battery pack and communicates with the embedded computer over tcp / ip .",
    "the connection can be made over wifi , making the whole crutch wireless . however , during the competition a wired connection was used to avoid interference .",
    "the joystick is used to change behaviors ; the legality of behavior changes was tailored to the competition .",
    "the trigger button acts as a play cue and will initiate movement ; every step is triggered separately .",
    "this gives the pilot the ability to synchronize his weight shift and the start of a step himself , but also allows for a brief recovery after an unbalanced step .",
    "triggering the next step is allowed @xmath9 before the end of the current one , allowing the pilot a continuous walking motion if desired .",
    "in preparation for the cybathlon , extensive training was undertaken so that our pilot could complete as many tasks in as little time as possible . prior to this event ,",
    "our pilot had approximately 20 hours of experience in previous exoskeletons over the course of six years . in the following section",
    ", we will present the resulting trajectories for some of the tasks collected during this training .",
    "we also discuss some of the settings used , as well as observations made by our pilot during training and the competition .",
    "our pilot was confident enough with the walking gait that , after the competition , he used mina v2 to navigate the streets of zurich , as shown in .    for the competition ,",
    "the low - level motor controllers were set to track desired positions , but have the capability of controlling the joint impedance .",
    "we are preparing another manuscript which explores the dynamic effects of our toe - off strategy in greater depth .",
    "we required the pilot to have an american spinal injury association impairment scale of either an a ( complete ) or b ( incomplete ) . before each session , the pilot was examined for preexisting bruises , open sores , skin lesions , or skin irritations .",
    "after each day of training , the pilot was examined to determine if the use of mina v2 caused any bruising , chafing , or skin irritations .        when walking over flat ground , the desired step length was set to @xmath10 , with a transfer duration of @xmath11 and a swing duration of @xmath12 , resulting in an average velocity of @xmath0 . while this results in the transfer phase making up a considerably higher percent of the gait than in able - bodied walking , it provided the pilot adequate time to comfortably and reliably reposition the crutches between steps when walking continuously",
    ". both transfer and swing durations could be reduced through more training , as well as increasing step length .",
    "however , these parameters were found to produce a fairly comfortable gait for the pilot during training .",
    "he was able to maintain this walking speed for a considerable duration without substantial fatigue , often training for over an hour at a time .",
    "higher walking speeds were attempted , but were not reliable enough for the competition given the relatively brief training period .",
    "the resulting trajectories for the transfer and swing legs for walking on flat ground are illustrated in , which shows the average swing and stance leg joint angles during a step .",
    "the duration has been normalized to the step time .",
    "the shaded gray region represents the transfer phase of the walking gait . as can be seen ,",
    "the resulting trajectories are smooth .",
    "there is significant toe - off during transfer , with the stance hip angle changing moving the pilot forward , helping the pilot start walking .",
    "the stepping stones task at the cybathlon consisted of a series of small wooden platforms that the pilot had to step on sequentially , without allowing their feet to contact the ground around the platform .",
    "this required long steps , typically starting from a static position .",
    "a large degree of toe - off was utilized to help propel the pilot forward off of his trailing foot , towards the next stone , during transfer .",
    "we found that this greatly assisted our pilot in starting his step to the next stone .",
    "this task particularly highlights the contributions of including powered toe - off in the walking gait , as we were one of only two teams able to successfully complete it during the competition . illustrates how this large toe - off angle helps the pilot move his weight towards his stance foot before swing",
    "the stair height for the cybathlon was @xmath13 , and we used a transfer duration of @xmath14 and swing duration of @xmath15 , resulting in the joint trajectories shown in . while this is substantially slower than what is used in flat walking , it allowed our pilot to shift his weight forward over the leading foot before raising it .",
    "unlike other exoskeletons , we ascended a stair with each step , as illustrates , placing only one foot on each step , similar to typical human motions .",
    "we believe that this was made possible because of the use of powered ankle plantar flexion .",
    "typically , pilots take a step up on one side , and then bring the other foot to the same step .",
    "our pilot was able to utilize this approach quite successfully in practice and the competition , being able to reliably and quickly ascend the stairs .",
    "these trajectories were then played back backwards to descend the stairs .          using the proposed hardware and trajectory design",
    ", we were able to place second in the 2016 cybathlon powered exoskeleton competition .",
    "we performed the sofa , slalom , ramp and door , stepping stones , and stairs tasks in @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the first and second race , respectively .",
    "we bypassed the tilted path task both races , as it placed significant strain on our pilot , and we did not feel comfortable attempting all tasks given our short and aggressive training schedule .",
    "we felt that these tasks capitalized on the strengths of our hardware , approach , and pilot , enabling us to place second in the competition .",
    "our pilot reported high levels of satisfaction with both the mina v2 hardware and the underlying gait design .",
    "he found that the powered ankles assisted in maintaining stability during swing , potentially by having the foot functioning as more of a contact patch than a the contact point provided when unpowered .",
    "this then enables the pilot to better control his center of pressure by shifting his weight throughout the contact surface . having tested with mina v1 and x1",
    ", he felt that mina v2 is the most comfortable exoskeleton he has tried to date , and found that the inclusion of toe - off assisted greatly in walking .",
    "additionally , he reported that utilizing toe - off allowed him to shift more of his weight into the exoskeleton , away from his crutches .",
    "this work presents team ihmc s entry to the powered exoskeleton competition in the 2016 cybathlon , a competition designed to push the development of new exoskeleton technologies for paraplegics .",
    "mina v2 is a new exoskeleton developed by ihmc that includes powered ankle plantar flexion , a feature not present in most other orthotic exoskeletons .",
    "we utilize a custom ball - screw driven actuator with a modular design on all six joints , allowing easier repair and maintenance .",
    "we then developed a distributed control architecture , with high level trajectories being generated using an embedded computer in the backpack .",
    "we also present our novel joint kinematic trajectory design approach that centralizes around the inclusion of powered toe - off . when combined with our unique parameterized swing leg trajectory ,",
    "the pilot is able to utilize powered toe - off motion to help the ground to improve performance .",
    "this was used throughout all the tasks in the competition to start or continue walking , as well as help power up the ramp and stairs .",
    "we then illustrated the effectiveness of this methodology through our results in the 2016 cybathlon .    using this approach ,",
    "team ihmc was able to place 2nd in the 2016 cybathlon .",
    "the capabilities of exoskeletons with powered ankles offer significantly greater potential , however . without powered ankle plantar flexion ,",
    "true dynamic walking in exoskeletons without the use of crutches is not possible .",
    "additionally , the inclusion of powered ankles enables the development of balancing strategies that potentially remove the need for crutches altogether .",
    "this represents a major step forward in exoskeleton research , enabling further development not possible otherwise .",
    "support for this work comes from nsf award iis1427213 , as well as generous support from stormy dawn anderson .",
    "we would also like to thank our media team , billy howell and jason conrad , for helping giving us a fun work environment and putting out wonderful videos .",
    "we would also like to thank the rest of the ihmc robotics lab for all their help and support throughout this project .",
    "lastly , we would like to thank our pilot , mark daniel , without who s wonderful attitude , incredible work ethic , and bravery to try new things none of this would have been possible .",
