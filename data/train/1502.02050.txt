    "[ introduction ] at a distance of @xmath1130  pc , irc+10216 ( cw  leonis ) is the nearest example of a carbon - rich asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "irc+10216 is believed to be nearing the end of its evolution on the agb and to be close to transitioning into a protoplanetary nebula ( e.g. , skinner et al .",
    "1998 ; osterbart et al .",
    "its proximity and advanced evolutionary state make irc+10216 an object of considerable interest for understanding the late stages of evolution for intermediate mass stars .",
    "some fundamental properties of irc+10216 are summarized in table  1 .",
    "as expected for a star approaching the end of its agb lifetime , irc+10216 is undergoing mass loss at a high rate ( @xmath6 yr@xmath7 ) and is surrounded by an extensive circumstellar envelope ( cse ) .",
    "this cse has been widely studied using a variety of observational tracers , including dust - scattered optical light ( mauron & huggins 1999 ) ; far infrared emission from dust ( e.g. , young et al .",
    "1993 ; ladjal et al .",
    "2010 ; decin et al .",
    "2011 ; groenewegen et al .",
    "2012 ) ; far ultraviolet ( fuv ) continuum ( sahai & chronopoulos 2010 ) ; and spectral line emission from co ( e.g. , knapp et al . 1998 ; fong et al .",
    "2003 ; cernicharo et al .",
    "2014 ) and a host of other molecules ( e.g. , olofsson et al . 1982 ; cernicharo et al .",
    "2000 ; patel et al . 2009 , 2011 ; de  beck et al .",
    "such studies have established that the cse of irc+10216 is chemically complex and exhibits non - spherical structure on scales ranging from milliarcseconds ( e.g. , tuthill et al . 2000 ; weigelt et al .",
    "2002 ; leo et al .",
    "2006 ) to tens of arcminutes ( sahai & chronopoulos 2010 ; ladjal et al .",
    "irc+10216 has a moderately high space velocity ( table  1 ) , and at large distances from the star ( @xmath80.3  pc ) , there are also visible signatures of interaction between the outermost cse and the interstellar medium ( ism ) , including a bow shock ahead of the star , and a wide - angle `` vortical tail '' trailing its direction of space motion ( sahai & chronopoulos 2010 ; ladjal et al .",
    "2010 ) .    despite the vast literature on the chemistry and morphology of the irc+10216 cse ,",
    "comparatively little is known about the predominant component of the cse by mass ( @xmath170%)the hydrogen gas .",
    "outstanding questions include the total mass of the circumstellar hydrogen , the fraction that is in atomic versus molecular form as a function of distance from the star , and the relationship ( both spatial and kinematic ) between the hydrogen gas and the dust and other molecules .",
    "such information is important for deciphering the complex mass loss histories of stars like irc+10216 , including the amount of mass that they return to the ism while on the agb , and the details of their transition from agb stars to planetary nebulae .",
    "glassgold & huggins ( 1983 ; hereafter gh83 ) showed that for a given mass loss rate , the fraction of an agb star wind that is comprised of molecular hydrogen versus atomic hydrogen is expected to depend largely on the stellar effective temperature , @xmath9 , with the transition from predominantly atomic to predominantly molecular winds predicted to occur for @xmath10  k. this is largely independent of whether the star has a carbon - rich or oxygen - rich atmosphere .",
    "effective temperature determinations for irc+10216 are notoriously uncertain owing to the high opacity of the star s dusty envelope , and values in the literature show considerable scatter .",
    "however , with the exception of menshchikov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who proposed an effective temperature in the range 2500 - 3000  k based on a combination of radiative transfer and stellar evolutionary modelling , nearly all other published determinations lie within the temperature range where molecular hydrogen is expected to comprise the bulk of the wind and envelope : e.g. , 2230  k ( cohen 1979 ) ; 1800  k ( phillips et al . 1982 ) ; 2330@xmath11350  k ( ridgway & keady 1988 ) ; 2200@xmath11150  k ( ivezi & elitzur 1996 ) ; 1915 - 2105  k ( bergeat et al . 2001 ) .",
    "observations to date have supported the suggestion that the bulk of the irc+10216 cse is comprised of molecular rather than atomic gas ( see  [ previous ] for details ) , and indeed , radiation from h@xmath12 molecules has been proposed as the source of the extended fuv emission seen by _ galex _ ( sahai & chronopoulos 2010 ) . however , even for stars as cool as @xmath12000  k , a thin shell of atomic hydrogen is predicted to form at the edge of the cse as a result of photodissociation of h@xmath12 and heavier molecules by the interstellar radiation field ( morris & jura 1983 ; gh83 ) . for slightly warmer stars ( @xmath132200  k ) , some small fraction of the hydrogen in the inner cse ( @xmath141% ) is also expected be atomic as a result of `` freeze - out '' of the photospheric abundances ( gh83 ) . in the case of irc+10216 , both processes are predicted to produce quantities of atomic hydrogen that are within the detection limits of modern radio telescopes ( gh83 ) . furthermore , for stars like irc+10216 that have appreciable space velocities , additional neutral hydrogen may be swept up from the ambient ism ( villaver et al .",
    "2002 , 2012 ) .",
    "motivated by these predictions , we have undertaken a sensitive new search for atomic hydrogen in the irc+10216 cse using  21-cm line mapping observations obtained with the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "fit components and their uncertainties were determined using the aips task xgaus .",
    "the fitted spectrum was integrated over a 300@xmath15 region centered on the position of irc+10216 .",
    "the rms residual was 2.6  mjy over the fitted lsr velocity range from @xmath16 to 87  .      in terms of peak column density ,",
    "the dominant spectral component in figure  [ fig : onstar ] is centered near @xmath17  ( viz .",
    "component  3 in table  a1 ) .",
    "two other weaker components ( 2 and 4 in table  a1 ) are also found at similar velocities ( @xmath18  and @xmath19  , respectively ) . toward the galactic latitude and longitude of irc+10216 ,",
    "all three of these components have velocities consistent with values expected for gas in regular galactic rotation ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",
    "this implies that some of this gas may be local to the star or lie within its galactic neighborhood .",
    "however , this remains unconfirmed , and to our knowledge , no interstellar absorption features have been unambiguously detected at comparable velocities in the spectra of background stars in this region ( kendall et al .",
    "2002 ; mauron & huggins 2010 ) .",
    "[ llcc ] a second dominant component in our gbt spectrum ( component  5 in table  a1 ) is centered near @xmath20  and has a rather narrow linewidth ( fwhm@xmath211.7  ) , indicating the presence of very cold gas .",
    "we attribute this component to the well - known local leo cold cloud ( llcc ) .",
    "portions of the llcc were first discovered by verschuur ( 1969 ) , and haud ( 2010 ) later showed that the emission detected by verschuur is actually part of a vast ribbon of clouds of similar linewidths and velocities , stretching from approximately 7  hr to 11  hr in ra and @xmath22 to @xmath23 in dec . using stellar absorption line measurements , peek et al .",
    "( 2011b ) constrained the distance of the llcc to lie in the range 11.3  pc to 24.3  pc  i.e .",
    ", in the foreground of irc+10216 and comfortably inside the local bubble .",
    "peek et al . also demonstrated a clear correlation between the  emission from the llcc and 100@xmath24 m dust emission .    within the region we have mapped with the gbt",
    ", we find that the highest llcc  column densities correlate with a region of enhanced fuv surface brightness to the southwest of the irc+10216 astrosphere ( figure  [ fig : llcc ] ) .",
    "this correlation implies that this fuv - emitting material is not debris shed by irc+10216 , despite its location downstream of irc+10216 s space trajectory and in spite of what appear to be fuv - emitting filaments connecting this cloud to the astrosphere .      broad , high - velocity wings are another feature of the spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : onstar ] .",
    "these wings are also seen in the galfa spectrum presented by menten et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , confirming they are not artefacts caused by poor baseline fits or erroneous stray radiation corrections . at positive lsr velocities",
    ", low - level emission can be seen stretching to velocities as high as @xmath1100  , and we were able to parametrize this with a broad gaussian of fwhm@xmath191.5  , centered at @xmath25  ( component  6 in table  a1 ) . while it is reasonable to question whether the large gas dispersion implied by such a broad gaussian is physically meaningful , we note that similarly broad gaussian components have been reported by other workers at high galactic latitude and have been suggested to arise from halo gas with a high velocity dispersion ( kalberla et al . 1998 ; haud & kalberla 2006 ) .    regardless of whether the extended red line wing in the spectrum represents a single velocity component or a blend of several along the line - of - sight",
    ", the presence of gas extending to such high velocities can not be accounted for by galactic disc rotation , particularly given the relatively high galactic latitude of irc+10216 ( stark et al .",
    "1994 ; hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , based on maps presented by wakker & van woerden ( 2013 ) , the irc+10216 field lies near the outskirts of the `` wa '' high - velocity cloud complex , which is characterized by lsr velocities in the range 80 - 195  ( wakker & van woerden 1991 ) .",
    "an association between the high positive velocity gas we observe and the wa complex is therefore possible .",
    "distance estimates to the wa complex place this material at 15 - 20  kpc ( wakker & van woerden 2013 ) , or well out in the galactic halo .",
    "[ ivg ] at negative lsr velocities , a `` shoulder '' of emission is seen blueward of @xmath26  in the spectrum in figure  [ fig : onstar ] . in the fit presented in table  a1",
    ", we have characterized this emission with a gaussian centered at @xmath27  and a fwhm linewidth of 19.5  ( component  1 in table  a1 ) .",
    "the peak column density of this component therefore occurs at a velocity close to the stellar systemic velocity of irc+10216 , and indeed , as described in  [ windhi ] , there is evidence that a small portion of this emission is in fact related to the irc+10216 cse .",
    "however , as seen from our own channel maps of the region ( figure  [ fig : cmaps ] ) , as well from larger - scale maps of galactic  ( e.g. , hartmann & burton 1997 ) , gas spanning these velocities is widespread throughout the region , particularly to the north of irc+10216 , and is far too pervasive to be accounted for entirely from mass loss from irc+10216 .    in optical absorption line spectra of three stars within @xmath28 of irc+10216 ,",
    "kendall et al . ( 2002 ) detected an absorption feature at @xmath29  that they attributed to a diffuse interstellar band .",
    "one of the targets stars lies in the foreground of irc+10216 ( at a distance of @xmath155  pc ) , and menten et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argued that gas at even higher negative velocities is also likely to lie in the foreground of irc+10216 .",
    "while this can not be excluded , menten et al.s arguments are based on the assumption of monotonic galactic rotation .",
    "however , we note that toward the direction of irc+10216 , gas velocities of @xmath3020  are `` forbidden '' and lie outside the range nominally expected for disc rotation ( e.g. , hartmann & burton 1997 ) . thus according to the definition of wakker & van woerden ( 2013 ) ,",
    "the material comprising component  1 in our spectrum qualifies as intermediate velocity gas .    based on maps of the distributions of known intermediate velocity clouds ( wakker & van woerden 2013 ) , we see that irc+10216 sightline lies in proximity to the iv  arch intermediate velocity cloud complex .",
    "this complex includes gas with velocities in the range @xmath31 ( with the lower negative velocity cutoff being somewhat ambiguous owing to confusion from galactic emission ; kuntz & danly 1996 ) .",
    "these velocities are comparable to those represented by component  1 of our gbt spectrum , although based on the results of kuntz & danly , the peak column density gas in the iv  arch complex more typically arises @xmath110 - 15  blueward of the peak column density of component  1 .",
    "we conclude that an association between component  1 and the iv  arch complex is plausible but can not be made conclusively . based on the results of wakker ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the distance of the iv  arch complex lies in the range 0.8 - 1.8  kpc , or at several times the distance of irc+10216 .",
