    "starting with the work of herbig & jones ( 1981 ) , who studied the hh 1/2 outflow , the study of proper motions of herbig - haro ( hh ) objects has become one of the fundamental tools in exploring the properties of outflows from young stars .",
    "proper motions of young stellar outflows were first measured at radio wavelengths by rodrguez et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who studied the serpens `` triple source '' . later , noriega - crespo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) first obtained proper motions of outflows at ir wavelengths of hh1 , from h@xmath5 2.12@xmath6 m images .",
    "in contrast to what has happened at optical and radio wavelengths , the study of ir proper motions of young stellar outflows has not flourished .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that older ir images typically cover only relatively small fields , so that it is many times impossible to obtain a good centering / scaling between them and newer ( larger field ) ir images .",
    "previous ir proper motion studies include noriega - crespo et al .",
    "( 1997 : hh1 ) , chrysostomou et al .",
    "( 2000 : hh7 - 11 , 25 - 26 and 33/40 ) and raines et al .",
    "( 2000 : ggd37 ) .    in this paper",
    "we make a first attempt to measure proper motions from spitzer - irac ir images of young stellar outflows .",
    "this is possible because even though the irac pixels are relatively large ( @xmath7 ) , some outflows have now been observed over time intervals of @xmath3  yr .",
    "for example , for an outflow with plane - of - the - sky velocities of @xmath8  km  s@xmath2 at a distance of @xmath9  pc , offsets of @xmath10 pixels are expected over @xmath3  yr . as shown initially by raga , barnes & mateo ( 1990 ) , such offsets can be measured with reasonable accuracy in ccd images of stellar outflows .",
    "there are three fundamental reasons that allow us to use irac to measure proper motions in the mid - ir , despite its relative low angular resolution ( fwhm@xmath112 ) in comparison with optical or near - ir ground based observations .",
    "first of all is the outstanding stability of the pointing control system of the spitzer space telescope over the past nine years .",
    "secondly , the unchanged performance of its optical system and its detectors .",
    "thirdly , the ability of irac to map large regions of the sky , thus providing plenty of point sources that can be used to create and fix a reliable reference frame to compare observations from different epochs .",
    "we study two 4.5  irac frames of the ngc  1333 region , obtained in february / september 2004 and",
    "october / november 2011 .",
    "these observations are described in detail in section 2 .",
    "these images allow us to obtain the proper motions of some of the hh7 - 11 knots ( hh7 , 8 and 10 ) , which can be compared with previous optical ( herbig & jones 1983 ; noriega - crespo & garnavich 2001 ) and ir ( chrysostomou et al . 2000 ) proper motion measurements of this outflow .",
    "this is done in section 3 .",
    "also , these images allow us to obtain the proper motions of other outflows in ngc  1333 , as described in section 4 .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "ngc  1333 was one of the first star forming regions observed with the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) with the infrared array camera ( irac ) ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) during the cryo - mission as part of the irac gto program of its principal investigator ( pi ) ( pid 6 , g. fazio ) .",
    "this first epoch was complemented approximately six months later by the cores - to - disks spitzer legacy program as part of their mapping of the perseus molecular cloud ( pid 178 , pi n. evans ) .",
    "multiple epoch observations of star forming regions relatively near the ecliptical plane are essential to weed out asteroids when trying to identify real proto - stellar objects ( see e.g. evans et al .",
    "the more recent data were obtained in october - november 2011 , and are being currently analyzed to study the time variability of young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the region , as part of the warm - mission spitzer exploration program ysovar ( pid 61026 , pi j. stauffer ) .",
    "ysovar has observed the core of ngc  1333 , a @xmath11 16@xmath1211  region centered on 03h29m10.175s + 31d16m16.0s , over a period of nearly a month using 73 different visits .",
    "each visit lasted approximately 15 minutes with a mean coverage of @xmath13 in the final maps , although some pixels in the overlap regions can double these values .",
    "our final 2010 image has a mean coverage of @xmath14 , i.e. , on average each pixel has seen the object some 300 times , and since the observing time per pixel is 12 sec , this corresponds to a @xmath11 one hour total exposure time .",
    "this central map has determined the size of the region that we have used for our analysis of the proper motions between the two ( 2004 & 2011 ) available epochs .",
    "the final map is actually a bit smaller to avoid the scattered light present around the very bright young star lzk 12 in the very deep ysovar image .",
    "the cryo - mission observations were carried using all irac channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 & 8.0 ) , while in the warm - mission observations we can only use channels 1 and 2 ( 3.6 and 4.5 ) . for the three mentioned programs , the data was collected using the high - dynamic - range ( hdr ) mode with a 12sec integration time for the long frames and 0.6sec for the short ones .",
    "for the purpose of our analysis we have concentrated on the data at 4.5 , which for young stellar outflows has proven to be a very good tracer of the molecular hydrogen emission of some of the bright pure rotational transitions [ ( 0 - 0 s(9 ) at 4.6947 , 0 - 0 s(10 ) at 4.4096 and 0 - 0 s(11 ) at 4.1810 ] , and therefore , of their shock excited emission ( noriega - crespo et al .",

    "2009 ; raga et al . 2011 ; noriega - crespo & raga 2012 ) .    for the irac observations we have used the latest versions of the data , s18.18.0 ( cryo ) and s19.0.0 ( warm ) , and a scale of 0.3/pix for the final maps , i.  e. a seventh of the irac fwhm@xmath11 2  angular resolution .",
    "the maps of the different epochs are created with the same fiducial frame , using mopex ( makovoz , khan & masci 2006 ) , which brings them very close to the same frame of reference .",
    "a dozen non - saturated stars common between the two epochs are then used for the final alignment of the images , with a typical centroid accuracy of less than a tenth of a pixel .",
    "the two resulting maps ( 2004 and 2011 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "difference image . center : 2011 image .",
    "bottom : 2004 image . in the difference image ,",
    "the knots along outflows with proper motions show up as `` positive / negative '' double ridge structures , and the white disks are masked stars .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    figure 1 shows the two final images ( 2004 and 2011 ) , and the difference between these two images . in the difference map",
    ", one can clearly see that some of the compact emission features show clear proper motions .",
    "for example , a bow - shaped region in the sw region of the frame shows a `` positive / negative '' ridge combination which clearly indicates a motion of this feature .",
    "such motions are analyzed in detail below .",
    "although there are no major changes in the optics of the telescope or the performance of the detectors between the irac cryo and warm missions , a comparison between the 2004 and 2011 images shows stronger optical ghosts around the bright sources in the warm data .",
    "this effect is probably enhanced because of the very deep coverage of the ysovar data ( with @xmath11 300 exposures of 12 sec for each pixel , see above ) .",
    "figure 2 shows a 3.5@xmath123.5region of ngc  1333 with some bright sources , where one can see the typical heart shape irac point spread function , with the nearby `` triangular ghosts '' marked with the white boxes ( 12@xmath1212 ) .",
    "these are an annoyance more than a problem in measuring the proper motions , since they appear as real time variations between epochs . for this reason we have masked some of them in both final ( 2004 and 2011 ) images .",
    "the observations are summarized in table 1 .    ]",
    "in figure 3 , we show the 2004 frame of the hh7 - 11 outflow .",
    "hh 9 is not seen in the 4.5  irac maps , and hh11 is lost within the psf of svs13 .",
    "the image shows a knot @xmath15 to the s of hh10 , which we have labeled `` knot a '' ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "figure 3 also shows proper motion vectors calculated with the `` proper motion mapping '' technique described by raga et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . this ( rather simplistic ) technique is described in appendix a. in particular , the hh7 - 11 proper motions shown in figure 3 were computed with cross correlations in boxes of size @xmath16 pixels ( with each pixel corresponding to @xmath17 , see section 2 ) which have peak fluxes of at least @xmath18 mjy / sterad ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the proper motion velocities were calculated assuming a distance of 220  pc to ngc  1333 ( ~ cernis 1990 ; hirota et al .",
    "2008 ) .    ]    the hh7 , 8 and 10 knots have velocities @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 ( hh7 : 13 km s@xmath2 ; hh8 : 10 km s@xmath2 ; hh10 : 9 km s@xmath2 ) , with hh7 and hh8 moving approximately parallel to the outflow axis , and hh10 showing a possibly significant deviation towards the s. these proper motions were obtained by averaging the proper motions from the two boxes closest to the peak emisison of the knots .",
    "also the region between hh7 and 8 shows filamentary structures which apparently share the kinematics of these two hh knots ( see figure 3 ) .    knot a has a significantly higher proper motion velocity of @xmath20 km s@xmath2 , pointing approximately e. this knot could belong to one of the other outflows present in this complex region ( see section 4 and davis et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "finally , relatively large proper motions are seen within @xmath21 from the svs13 outflow source ( outside the upper , right hand side corner of figure 3 ) , which are probably related with the spikes of the psf , and are unlikely to represent real motions in the flow .",
    "the proper motions that we have obtained for hh 7 , 8 and 10 are roughly consistent with the velocities of @xmath22  km  s@xmath2 determined for these knots with the proper motion determinations of noriega - crespo & garnavich ( 2001 ) , scaled to a distance of 220  pc to hh7 - 11 .",
    "the proper motions of herbig & jones ( 1981 ) are also consistent with these relatively low velocities .",
    "the velocities of @xmath23  km  s@xmath2 determined by chrysostomou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are inconsistent with the three other independent ( optical and ir ) proper motion determinations .",
    "in figure 4 , we show a @xmath24 field ( covered in the two epochs ) approximately centered on the hh 7 - 11 outflow . on the 2004 frame , we show the axes of the molecular outflows ( which we have numbered 1 through 9 ) described by davis et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . as already seen in the diffenerce image between the two epochs ( see figure 1 and section 2 ) ,",
    "there are several regions of extended emission which show detectable proper motions .",
    "the proper motions shown in figure 4 correspond to cross correlations within @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) pixel boxes of the two epochs , with fluxes of at least @xmath27 mjy / sterad ( see appendix a ) .    we have chosen 6 regions ( labeled a through f in figure 4 ) which show the more interesting proper motion detections .",
    "these regions are described in the following subsections .    ]",
    "this region ( see figure 5 ) includes the hh 7 - 11 outflow ( the smaller box within region a in figure 4 , corresponding to the blue - shifted , 7 - 11 lobe , is shown in figure 3 ) .",
    "it is clear that while organized proper motions ( aligned with the outflow axis ) are seen along the hh 7 , 8 , 10 knots , such motions are not seen in the nw outflow lobe .    to the s of the svs 13 source , relatively large proper motions with easterly direction",
    "are seen , but it is not clear that these motions are associated with well defined knots ( except for `` knot a '' of figure 3 , see section 3 ) . these motions might be associated with a previously undetected outflow .    in the center of the frame , at @xmath28 from the southern edge of the frame , we see a bow - like region with northward proper motions of @xmath3  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these marginally detected motions could be associated with the northern lobe of outflow 4 ( see figure 4 ) .    ]",
    "close to the sw corner of the frame , we see a region with a broken - up , bow - like structure with proper motion velocities of @xmath29 - 70 km s@xmath2 to the n or ne .",
    "this motion appears to be shared by some of the knots seen in the nw region of figure 5 .",
    "all of these northward directed knots appear to belong to outflow 6 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this region ( see figures 4 and 6 ) shows two systems of knots with different proper motions .",
    "one set of knots ( in the northern part of figure 6 ) has proper motion velocities of 20 - 100 km s@xmath2 directed approximately to the sse .",
    "this set of knots appears to be associated with outflow 2 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "a second set of knots ( in the southern half of figure 6 ) shows proper motions of similar magnitudes ( 10 - 60 km s@xmath2 ) , but directed eastwards .",

    "as described above , we detect proper motions for knots which are likely to be associated with several of the outflows of davis et al .",
    "these outflows are numbered 1 through 9 in figure 4 .    for each of these outflows ,",
    "the following results are obtained :    * _ outflow 1  - _ we measure proper motions of up to 20 km s@xmath2 along the se lobe of this outflow .",
    "these proper motions are consistent with the optical proper motions measured for hh 7 - 11 by noriega - crespo & garnavich ( 2001 ) .",

    "therefore , we detect knots with measurable proper motions which are likely to be associated with all but one of the outflows of davis et al . ( 2008 ) .    ]",
    "if we are detecting most of the outflows in ngc 1333 , the measured proper motion velocities @xmath36 allow us to obtain the distribution function associated with the outflows from a group of stars currently being formed . if we consider the maximum value of @xmath36 for the 8 outflows of davis et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with measured proper motions ( see subsection 4.7 ) , we find that we have 3 with maximum @xmath36 in the @xmath37 km s@xmath2 range , 1 outflow in each of the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 km s@xmath2 ranges , and 2 outflows with @xmath36 in the @xmath41 km s@xmath2 range . the resulting distribution function ( normalized to a total of 5 outflows ,",
    "see below ) is shown in figure 11 .",
    "the distribution function shows an apparent peak at low proper motion velocities ( @xmath36 ) , and possibly also a marginal peak in the higher velocity bin .",
    "one can show that this distribution is not consistent with a set of outflows with identical intrinsic velocities @xmath42 and with arbitrary orientation angles with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if we have a set of outflows with outflow velocity @xmath42 and with arbitrary orientations , the expected distribution function for the proper motion velocities @xmath36 is : @xmath43^{-1/2 } \\label{fv}\\ ] ] this distribution function is plotted in figure 11 , considering @xmath44 km s@xmath2 . in this figure , the distribution function obtained from the 8 observed outflows has been normalized to 5 outflows , i.e. , not considering the 3 outflows in the @xmath37 km s@xmath2 bin .",
    "a comparison between the observed and theoretical distributions shows that a single population of @xmath44 km s@xmath2 outflows ( at random orientations ) does not produce a proper motion velocity distribution consistent with the data .",
    "the dashed histogram shows the distribution function obtained by binning the peak proper motion velocities of the 8 outflows of davis et al .",
    "( 2008 ) which we have detected , normalized to a total of only 5 outflows .",
    "the solid curve is the distribution function expected for a set of outflows of intrinsic velocity @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 at random orientations ( see equation 1 ) . ]",
    "particularly , from figure 11 it is clear that the observed outflows have a large population in the lowest velocity bin ( @xmath37 km s@xmath2 ) , for which the `` @xmath44 km s@xmath2 model '' predicts low frequencies .",
    "this large population of the lowest proper motion velocity bin therefore implies that some of the outflows in our group indeed have a low , full spatial velocity , of at most @xmath45 km s@xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we present a first attempt to derive proper motions of young stellar outflows from spitzer ( irac ) images .",
    "our analysis of the ngc 1333 region ( which includes the hh 7 - 11 outflow ) shows that it is indeed possible to do this , which opens up the possibility of obtaining new `` second epoch '' observations with spitzer , in order to derive proper motions for a relatively larger number of ir outflows .",
    "we have analyzed two epochs at a time interval of @xmath46 yr , and the fact that proper motions are indeed detected can be seen by taking the difference between the two frames ( see figure 1 ) . using these two frames ,",
    "we first derive the proper motions of hh 7 , 8 and 10 .",
    "the resulting proper motions correspond to plane of the sky velocities of @xmath19 km s@xmath2 ( see figure 3 and section 3 ) , at a distance of 220  pc , which are consistent with the optical proper motions of these objects derived by herbig & jones ( 1983 ) and noriega - crespo & garnavich ( 2001 ) .",
    "our results do not agree with the @xmath23  km  s@xmath2 ir proper motions of chrysostomou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we have then derived proper motion velocities for the emission knots in a @xmath24 field , many of which are aligned with the outflows described by davis et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . for one of these outflows ( outflow 3 ,",
    "see figure 4 ) , we find a clear bipolar motion ( with velocities of @xmath34 km s@xmath2 )",
    ". the co emission of this outflow is clearly seen in the observations of curtis et al .",
    "another remarkable result is the @xmath8 km s@xmath2 velocity derived for the southern bow shock of outflow 3 ( see figures 4 and 9 ) .    from the proper motions of the 8 outflows of davis et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for which we have measurements , we obtain a proper motion velocity distribution function ( see section 4.8 ) .",
    "we find that this distribution function is not consistent with a set of outflows with identical outflow velocities ( of @xmath8 km s@xmath2 ) at random orientations .",
    "the empirically derived distribution function indicates that some of the observed outflows have intrinsic outflow velocities @xmath47 km s@xmath2 , and that others have a much lower , @xmath48 - 20 km s@xmath2 velocity .",
    "this consists of a first suggestion that the velocities @xmath42 ( of a group of outflows from recently formed stars in the same cloud ) have a bimodal distribution .",
    "even though the derived proper motions only give partial constraints on the kinematics of the outflows in ngc 1333 , they do provide some of the information necessary for modelling this system .",
    "this is of particular interest , since it appears to be a case in which the outflows have a strong influence on the structure of their parental cloud , and might even be triggering the formation of more stars ( see sandell & knee 2001 ) . some other clouds might also be in a regime of strong perturbation from the outflows from ysos ( see , e.g. , are et al .",

    "it has now become standard to define boxes including emitting `` knots '' , and to carry out cross - correlations ( between the 2 frames ) of the emission within the boxes .",
    "the proper motion is then obtained from a fit to the peak of the cross - correlation function .",
    "this method has proven to be better than carrying out direct fits ( of e.g. , a gaussian or a 2d paraboloid ) to the observed emission features , because the cross - correlation functions ( which are integrals of the emission within the chosen boxes ) have higher signal - to - noise ratios than the images .    for images with many knots , it is simpler to use a regular array of boxes ( or `` tiles '' , as called by szyszka et al .",
    "2011 ) for computing cross correlations .",
    "proper motions for the emission within each of the boxes are then obtained from fits to their respective cross - correlation functions .    in this paper , we use tha setup described by raga et al .",
    "we define square boxes of side @xmath49 , with spacings of @xmath50 along each of the coordinates of the images .",

    "@xmath49(see figure 12 ) , we first check whether or not the condition @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the intensity of the image and @xmath53 is a user specified `` minimum flux '' ) is satisfied in at least one pixel within a central `` inner box '' of size @xmath50 . if this condition is met at least for a single pixel in each of the two epochs that are being analyzed , the cross - correlation function ( within the @xmath49-size box in the two frames ) and the proper motion ( from a paraboloidal fit to @xmath54 pixels centered on the peak of the cross correlation function ) are computed .     schematic diagram showing one of the cross correlation boxes ( thick line box , of size @xmath49 ) . the solid circle is the central position of this box , and the open circles are the central positions of the nearby cross correlation boxes . the inner box ( drawn with a thin line ) of size @xmath50 is used for evaluating whether or not the peak flux satisfies the criterion for calculating a proper motion ]    therefore , in order to compute a `` cross correlation map '' , it is then only necessary to specify the box size `` l '' and the minimum flux @xmath53 . actually , there is another `` hidden '' parameter which is the centering of the cuadricule of boxes with respect to the pixels of the image .",
    "this is fixed arbitrarily so that the first pixel of the frames that are being studied coincides with the edge of one of the cross - correlation boxes .",
    "we find that the peaks of the cross correlation boxes can be fitted to within @xmath55  pixel , a precision similar to the one of the alignment between the two epochs that we have used .",
