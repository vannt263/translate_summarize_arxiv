    "in other words , @xmath340 records the number of boxes of each possible entry in each row . since the entries are always arranged in weakly increasing order , and there are no gaps between consecutive boxes , this means that @xmath340 determines each row of @xmath88 , up to translation in the horizontal direction .",

    "consider the usual alternating sum expansion of @xmath336 , with each term being a product of entries of @xmath315 , one from each row and column .",
    "we see from the form ( [ 16.1 ] ) of the blocks of @xmath315 , that a given term in this expansion will have a factor of @xmath81 for each entry chosen from the @xmath378-block .",
    "thus , for a given monomial @xmath379 , the exponent @xmath275 determines the number of entries in the @xmath378-block that a term with this @xmath380-monomial will have .",

    "after we have finished with the operations of statement ( a ) above for all values of @xmath358 ( as the first index of @xmath392 ) , we are left with a matrix such that the only entry in any ones column equal to the reference entry is the reference entry itself .",

    "this in turn is where the 1 from the @xmath195-th column of @xmath51 gets put by the inverse of the standard stripping of @xmath88 .",
