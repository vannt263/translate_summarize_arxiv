    "bayesian inference is becoming popular in the physical sciences .",
    "it finds eloquent and noteworthy defenders @xcite , it is treated in a growing number of textbooks@xcite , an annual series of conferences@xcite as well as numerous articles report on its applications . even the `` guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement '' @xcite supported by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) , the bureau international des poids et msures ( bipm ) and other international organizations implicitly favors bayesian statistics   as dagostini points out ( in secs . 2.2 and 14.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "some authors that have collaborated in the formulation of the guide @xcite and of the german standard @xcite , adhere in their publications to `` a bayesian theory of measurement uncertainty '' @xcite .",
    "the change of paradigm from frequentist to bayesian statistics ( for this antagonism see e.g. the introduction of @xcite and ch .",
    "7 of @xcite ) is taking place despite the fact , that the disturbing vagueness of bayesian prior probabilities persists up to now .",
    "dagostini @xcite eloquently holds that the prior probabilities are the mathematical representation of an unavoidable subjectivity of judgments   even of scientific ones . in our opinion",
    ", however , a criterion exists that prior probabilities should meet   at least approximately   and which in many cases does not leave any freedom in their choice .",
    "this criterion is a consequence of the fact that bayesian inference has a frequentist interpretation   as will be explained below .",
    "this fact has been pointed out earlier ( by welch , peers , stein and villegas  ) in the literature of mathematical statistics but it seems rarely known in practice . in the present note",
    ", the criterion is described as well as the circumstances under which it is met .",
    "they amount to the existence of a symmetry of the model that states the relation between event and hypothesis .",
    "the bayesian prior is then a haar measure of the symmetry group . by helps of a realistic example taken from current nuclear physics",
    "it is shown that this procedure can be extended to the usual case of models with broken symmetry .",
    "finally the same example shows that the popular likelihood method   as described in @xcite yields confidence intervals of lower reliability than the bayesian procedure .",
    "bayesian statistics is a very useful tool for statistical inference .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the continuous event and @xmath1 the continuous hypotheses .",
    "suppose that the conditional probability @xmath2   the above mentioned model   as well as the event @xmath0 are given .",
    "the problem of statistical inference is : what can we learn from @xmath0 about @xmath1 ?",
    "the bayesian answer @xcite is a conditional probability @xmath3 for @xmath1 given @xmath0 which can be expressed in terms of the given distribution p , @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the prior distribution assigned to @xmath1 in the absence of or `` prior to '' any experimental evidence .",
    "hence , bayesian statistics relies on the assumption that @xmath5 is a meaningful object .",
    "the choice of the prior is the problem of bayesian theory , because it is not clear what we can know `` prior '' about @xmath1 .",
    "the view held e.g. in the recent article by dagostini @xcite or the recent textbook by howson and urbach @xcite is that the choice of @xmath5 should be left to the good taste and the experience of the scientist analyzing the event @xmath0 .",
    "they argue that a such a subjective element should be in any honest theory of inference since it makes explicit the subjectivity of any judgement   including the scientific ones : nothing can be known about @xmath1 in an objective way prior to the event . in subjective interpretation bayesian probabilities reflect personal confidence in hypotheses . it can be expressed in bets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this view does in principle not preclude objectivity altogether : objectivity exists as the limiting consequence of an infinite number of recorded events .",
    "indeed one can show that in this limit bayesian inference becomes independent of @xmath5 in the sense that @xmath6 then tends towards a @xmath7-distribution with respect to @xmath1   centered at the true value @xmath8 of the hypothesis .",
    "the subjective interpretation   taken literally and without appealing to some common sense   allows anything .",
    "this is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ bayesinverse ] ) : if one is free to choose @xmath5 , one can generate any @xmath9   given a finite number of events . to avoid this , we prefer to look for some criterion that would severely restrict the class of allowed priors .",
    "fortunately there is a very natural one .    consider a bayesian confidence area @xmath10 .",
    "it shall satisfy @xmath11 which is usually stated in the form : `` given the event @xmath0 , the hypothesis lies with confidence @xmath12 in the area @xmath13 '' .",
    "we want to reformulate this in a way which turns the vague notion of confidence into probability and by the same token defines the desired criterion .",
    "imagine an ensemble @xmath14 of events @xmath0 with relative frequencies @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath0 run over the ensemble and suppose that from every @xmath0 the confidence area @xmath16 is derived in a unique way , e.g. by determing the smallest one .",
    "this yields an ensemble of confidence areas .",
    "the criterion then is : the prior must lead to an ensemble of confidence areas such that they cover the true value @xmath8 with probability @xmath12 .    since this gedanken experiment   which can even be realized via monte carlo simulation   equates @xmath12 with a well defined frequency ( to cover @xmath8 ) , the criterion turns confidence into frequentist probability . in short",
    ": we require that bayesian confidence areas are frequentist confidence areas .",
    "it is proven in the mathematical literature @xcite that this criterion can be met exactly : let the conditional probability @xmath2 be invariant under a lie group @xmath17 represented as transformations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath18 suppose furthermore that the definition of the confidence area @xmath19 is invariant under @xmath17 , i.e @xmath20 then the _ right haar measure _ of the symmetry group is a suitable prior in the sense of the criterion .",
    "it is necessary for this , that the hypothesis can be identified with the symmetry group of the conditional probability , i.e. for every two hypotheses @xmath21,@xmath22 there must be exactly one transformation @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "then the uniqueness of the right haar measure implies the uniqueness of the prior and one has @xmath25^{-1},\\ ] ] which is the inverse jacobian of the transformation @xmath26 taken at the unit element of the group .",
    "note that the very interesting case of @xmath13 to be the smallest area of confidence @xmath12 , satisfies eq .",
    "( [ area ] ) , if the volume of @xmath13 is determined by help of the measure that is invariant under @xmath17 , i.e. the left haar measure .",
    "the prior distribution is not independent of the statistical model ; rather it is defined by the structure of the model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is prior to the observations .",
    "since the above symmetry uniquely defines the prior and since it ensures a frequentist interpretation of bayesian confidence intervals and since frequentist probability is often termed `` objective '' probability , one may call the present procedure _ objective _ bayesian statistics .",
    "however , we return to the word `` bayesian '' implying for the rest of the paper the qualification `` objective '' . by the following example , we show that this concept can be extended to models that lack the symmetry ( [ invariance ] ) .",
    "the measurement problems encountered in science , often do not have a symmetry ( [ invariance ] ) .",
    "however , bayesian inference based on a multi - dimensional event can usually be broken down into a succession of bayesian arguments on more elementary events until a starting point that possesses a symmetry has been found . to be definite let us consider the parity violating matrix elements measured by the triple collaboration in resonant p - wave scattering of polarized neutrons on heavy nuclei @xcite . for the present purpose it is not necessary to understand the details of those experiments .",
    "it suffices to know that the parity violating matrix elements   the events   have the gaussian probability @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an experimental error   supposed to be given   and @xmath29 is the root mean square parity violating matrix element .",
    "the latter one is the `` hypothesis '' to be determined .",
    "there is no symmetry ( [ invariance ] ) relating @xmath0 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , the probability of eq .",
    "( [ gaussprob ] ) remains invariant under simultaneous change of the scale of @xmath0 and @xmath30 .",
    "hence , bayesian inference should be done with respect to @xmath1 rather than @xmath29 . afterwards   when the posterior distribution of @xmath1 has been constructed",
    " one can derive statements about @xmath29 .",
    "e.g. one can decide whether with sufficiently high confidence @xmath1 is larger than @xmath28 and thus @xmath31 .",
    "the symmetry considerations require @xmath32 as prior , which is the haar measure of the lie group of scale changes .",
    "the problem of @xcite is complicated by the fact , that one usually does not know the total angular momentum of the p - wave resonance .",
    "only p@xmath33 resonances can show parity violation .",
    "if the event @xmath0 is gathered in a p@xmath34 resonance nothing can be learned about @xmath29 and the distribution of the event is @xmath35 .",
    "one knows , however , the probability @xmath36 of the occurrence of p@xmath33 resonances .",
    "again it is not necessary to discuss here the contents of nuclear physics that create this complication .",
    "it suffices to state , that the event @xmath0 follows with probability @xmath36 the distribution @xmath37 and with probability @xmath38 the distribution @xmath35 , so that one has @xmath39 the presence of the second term on the right hand side precludes any symmetry ( [ invariance ] ) relating @xmath0 and @xmath1   except in the limit of @xmath40 when @xmath41 and @xmath6 recovers the symmetry under scale changes .",
    "the full experiment of @xcite probes @xmath42 resonances @xmath43 under varying experimental conditions , so that @xmath44 becomes a function of the resonance @xmath45 .",
    "this alone precludes any symmetry of the multidimensional problem .",
    "if , however , one knows for one of the resonances that it is a p@xmath33 case , say for @xmath46 , then the event measured there has the distribution @xmath47 ; the symmetry is scale - invariance and the prior is ( [ prior ] ) ; one can use the event @xmath48 to construct the bayesian inverse @xmath49 ; it can be injected as prior distribution into the analysis of the results at @xmath50 .",
    "this procedure leads to a posterior distribution @xmath51 . in this way",
    ", one finds a starting point of the whole analysis which has a well defined symmetry and therefore a well defined prior .",
    "let us call the whole procedure an approximate bayesian ( ab ) one .",
    "it is not our purpose to reanalyze the data of refs .",
    "we only want to demonstrate , that the ab analysis satisfies the criterion described above to a good approximation . for the purpose of this",
    ", the ab analysis has been subjected to a monte carlo test with parameters close to those of the experimental cases @xcite .",
    "the number of resonances was chosen to be @xmath52 .",
    "the errors @xmath53 , @xmath54 have been drawn from an exponential distribution with mean value @xmath55 .",
    "this allows one to study ( on fig .",
    "[ fig : bayes - likelihood ] ) the result as a function of @xmath56   the mean error relative to the true value @xmath57 of the r.m.s .",
    "parity violating matrix element . in the experiments",
    "@xcite , @xmath58 ranged from 0.23 up to the order of unity .",
    "the coordinates @xmath59 of the event @xmath60 were generated in two steps .",
    "first one decides with probability @xmath61 , whether the quantity @xmath59 should belong to the p@xmath33-wave resonances .",
    "if yes then @xmath59 was drawn from an ensemble with distribution @xmath62 , else the distribution @xmath63 was applied .",
    "the vector @xmath0   without the information from which of the two ensembles anyone of the @xmath59 comes   is equivalent to the experimental `` event '' .",
    "the event @xmath0 was analyzed by assuming that the `` resonance '' @xmath64 , where the maximum of the ratio @xmath65 occurs , is a p@xmath33 resonance and can serve as the starting point of the analysis in the above sense . by help of the posterior distribution @xmath9 , the shortest confidence interval @xmath66 was found such that @xmath67 and it was recorded whether the true value @xmath57 was inside @xmath68 .",
    "this procedure was applied to @xmath69 vectors @xmath0 . on fig .",
    "[ fig : bayes - likelihood ] , the symbols labeled `` bayes '' give the relative frequency of `` success '' , i.e the probability to find @xmath57 in the above mentioned range performed for different @xmath58 which controls the experimental error . in this way , the curve on the figure was generated .",
    "( the full and dashed lines are 4th order polynomials fit to the points ) . because of the lack of symmetry , the result is not identical but only close to 0.68 ( the dotted line ) .",
    "however , in the limit of @xmath70 which means @xmath71 for all @xmath45 , the criterion is obeyed exactly   as it should be , since scale invariance is recovered in this limit .    in comparison ,",
    "a `` likelihood '' analysis was performed .",
    "this type of analysis is very popular .",
    "it amounts to the bayesian procedure with the prior distribution set constant . in the present case",
    ", we had to cut off the posterior distribution for @xmath72 in order to normalize it very much as in @xcite .",
    "the figure shows , that the likelihood method is inferior to even the approximate bayesian method . for good data , i.e. @xmath73 , the likelihood method yields confidence intervals that are   in the light of the criterion   too wide . for data of marginal quality ( @xmath74 ) , it yields no reliable confidence intervals , because the frequency of successes is considerably lower than the prescribed confidence .",
    "we have defined objective bayesian statistics by supplementing the bayesian argument with the requirement that it should yield `` objectively correct '' confidence intervals .",
    "a theorem by stein   which can be found in the published mathematical literature @xcite but which seems to be unknown in practice   shows that this requirement can be met provided that the conditional probability @xmath2 posses the symmetry ( [ invariance ] ) defined by a lie group . by way of an example",
    "we have extended objective bayesian statistics to the common case in which @xmath2 does not have an exact symmetry . in the example , a complex event @xmath75 is broken down into elementary ones @xmath59 among which there is at least one   say @xmath48   whose conditional probability @xmath76 possesses a symmetry ( [ invariance ] ) .",
    "it is used to define the prior @xmath5 .",
    "this has been termed approximate bayesian procedure .",
    "we have shown numerically that the ab procedure is superior to the popular likelihood method as judged by the objectivity of the deduced confidence intervals .",
    "note that the arguments presented here amount to a reconciliation of the subjective and frequentist interpretations of probability .",
    "the bayesian argument attributes a distribution to an object , i.e. the hypothesis , which is given by nature once and for all .",
    "this is justified by interpreting probability distributions as a representation of subjective knowledge on that object .",
    "the frequentist interpretation insists that a probability distribution must be verifiable   at least in a gedanken experiment   as a frequency distribution that occurs in some stochastic process . we have described a gedanken experiment to generate a distribution of bayesian confidence intervals from data that are conditioned by a fixed true value of the hypothesis .",
    "the rate of success , i.e. of the true value lying inside the confidence interval , turns out to be independent of the true value , moreover the rate of success is equal to the confidence prescribed in the bayesian procedure   if the conditional distribution possesses the symmetry ( [ invariance ] ) and if the prior is chosen to be the right haar measure",
    ". then the bayesian inference is found reasonable from a frequentist s point of view ."
