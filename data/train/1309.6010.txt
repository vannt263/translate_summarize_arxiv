    "a representation @xmath32 determines a pseudo - hyperbolic structure on @xmath33 i.e.a pseudo - developing map from its universal cover @xmath34 to hyperbolic space @xmath35 with holonomy @xmath36 taking the volume of this structure ( which is possibly zero or negative ) gives a function on the @xmath15character variety , @xmath37 dunfield establishes fundamental results about this function , which carry over to our setting .",

    "the volume is an invariant of the conjugacy class of a representation , and dunfield proves the following :    [ volume - complete ] let @xmath0 be a closed , hyperbolic 3manifold of finite volume , and @xmath48 . if @xmath49 is a representation with character @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then @xmath49 is discrete and faithful .",
    "if @xmath0 is not closed , dunfield defines the volume of a representation @xmath52 with respect to a so - called _ pseudo - developing map _ @xmath53 a pseudo - developing map is a @xmath49equivariant map which satisfies two technical conditions which ensure that the integral defining the volume of @xmath49 is both finite and independent of the chosen pseudo - developing map .",
    "we recall the definition .",
    "the space @xmath54 is the usual compactification of @xmath35 obtained by adding the sphere at infinity .",
    "the space @xmath55 is obtained from @xmath34 by adding countably many points as follows .",

    "also , dunfield only considers hyperbolic 3manifolds with one cusp .",
    "however , a careful examination of the material in  2.5 of @xcite reveals that it applies to multi  cusped hyperbolic 3manifolds .",
    "the following results from @xcite are therefore at our disposal :    the function @xmath80 defined by taking @xmath81 , where @xmath49 is any representation with character @xmath50 and @xmath74 is any pseudo - developing map for @xmath49 , is well  defined .",

    "the main issue at @xmath94 is that the fixed point set may not converge , and so the above argument of deforming polyhedra with ideal vertices may not apply . to avoid this situation , let @xmath107 then @xmath108 is a proper subvariety of @xmath109 and the function @xmath110 is smooth .",

    "a well - known consequence of thurston s hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem and its proof is that @xmath87 is a smooth point of @xmath114 and that the map @xmath115 defined by @xmath116 maps a small open neighbourhood of @xmath87 analytically to an open neighbourhood of @xmath117 , where @xmath118 with @xmath119 see , for instance thurston @xcite (  5.8 ) , neumann  zagier @xcite and porti @xcite ( corollaries 3.27 and 3.28 ) .",
