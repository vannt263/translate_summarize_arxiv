    "semiconductor solid state structures are believed to be the most promising prospective hardware for building a quantum computer .",
    "their decisive advantage , based on the existence of the huge semiconductor electronics technology , is their scalability@xcite : once few - qubit operations are successfully accomplished , the well - established modern semiconductor microelectronics industry greatly facilitates scaling up to many qubits .",
    "although long coherence times have been demonstrated in both gaas@xcite and si@xcite semiconductor devices , the two architectures are at different stages of development en route to an eventually viable quantum computer . in the gaas quantum dot system , one- and",
    "two - qubit manipulations have been experimentally demonstrated.@xcite however , in its counterpart silicon - based system , these manipulations are yet to be satisfactorily achieved , in spite of much efforts in several laboratories across the world .",
    "several features distinguish the silicon - based devices from the gaas systems .",
    "first , the silicon quantum dot systems generally have longer spin coherence time than the gaas system , due to some novel properties such as weak spin - orbit coupling and low nuclear spin density.@xcite in this regard , silicon - based devices are often considered to be ideal for quantum computation , because quantum error corrections protocols are easier to implement for qubits with longer coherence times . however , various traps and impurities introduced during the fabrication lead to unpredictable local fluctuations of the confinement potential , which has so far prevented a coherent manipulation in these quantum dot systems.@xcite in this regard , the si quantum dot qubit is inferior to the gaas quantum dot structure since the interface quality in the si system , particularly for the si / sio@xmath0 system ( but also to a lesser degree for the si / sige system ) , is substantially worse than the corresponding epitaxially perfect gaas / algaas system .",
    "second , the valley degree of freedom resulting from the special band structure of silicon , with bulk si having six equivalent conduction band minima ( i.e. a valley degeneracy of six ) , further complicates the problem.@xcite we also note that in silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor ( si - mos ) system as well as the sige system the coulomb interactions are stronger than that of the gaas devices , due to lower dielectric constant and larger effective mass , which consequently affects the exchange interaction.@xcite the larger electron effective mass of si compared with gaas makes the quantum tunneling weaker and the effective bohr radius smaller , leading to tighter lithographic constraints in si over gaas for achieving equivalent qubit properties , thus rendering the fabrication of si qubits much more difficult experimentally .    in spite of these experimental difficulties ,",
    "considerable progress has recently been made experimentally in silicon based systems , including both si - mos devices@xcite and si / sige structures.@xcite particularly important in the few - electron regime of a double quantum dot system is the charge stability diagram@xcite ( explained in more detail below ) , which is an intuitive and physical manifestation of the coulomb blockade@xcite physics as well as the controllability of the qubit via , for example , the tunnel coupling between the two dots .",
    "the variations of the tunnel coupling not only affect the exchange interaction in the actual qubit manipulation in a chosen subspace of the charge stability diagram , but also lead to a change in the geometry of the overall charge stability diagram .",
    "lai _ _ et al.__@xcite and simmons _ _ et al.__@xcite have demonstrated highly tunable double quantum dot systems on si - mos and si / sige systems , respectively .",
    "the charge stability diagrams over a wide range of electron occupancy were obtained in these experiments , and most interestingly they have shown how the patterns of the stability diagrams change as the tunnel coupling between the two dots is varied . in the experiment on si",
    "/ sige@xcite the numerical value of the tunnel coupling is extracted from experiments using a two - level model.@xcite these experiments have paved the way for the realization of singlet / triplet qubits in silicon , and a quantitative understanding of quantum effects in the charge stability diagrams in si coupled quantum dot experiments is the central goal of the present paper .    in a previous publication@xcite",
    "we have advocated a quantum theory using the generalized hubbard model to describe the double quantum dot system .",
    "the advantage of our theory over the traditionally used capacitance circuit model@xcite is that our model naturally includes quantum fluctuations , which is particularly suitable for the discussion of the physics of the tunnel coupling in the context of charge stability diagrams .",
    "although our approach is completely general since the only restrictions are symmetry considerations , we focused on the gaas system in our original@xcite work . in this paper",
    "we apply our method to the silicon quantum dot system .",
    "we start with a qualitative survey of the experimental results , followed by a detailed explanation of the assumptions and simplifications that we have made in applying our general theory to the si double quantum dot system .",
    "then we demonstrate that upon appropriately choosing the parameters , our theory is capable of giving quantitative description of the experimental charge stability diagram and tunnel coupling in the si system .",
    "we also outline several future research directions implied by our work .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : methods ] we explain the generalized hubbard model and the microscopic theory used in this work . sec .",

    "the results are compared to experiments side - by - side .",
    "[ sec : conculsion ] includes our discussion and conclusions .",
    "in the typical experimental setup of ref .  , the double quantum dots are confined by three barrier gates ( left , central and right ) and the depth of the potential wells in the dots is controlled by two plunger gates with voltages @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , in analogy to the left ( @xmath3 ) and right ( @xmath4 ) gate voltages of gaas devices.@xcite to shrink the dot size , the plunger gates are eliminated in ref .  , and the gate voltages @xmath3 and @xmath4 are used instead .",
    "the coulomb blockade@xcite means that the electron occupancy in each dot ( denoted by @xmath5 for dot @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) is typically changed by an integer as the gate voltages are swept , which can be directly detected by measuring the tunneling current , using a quantum point contact.@xcite as a consequence , a plot of the differential conductance on the plane with @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) as axes is a visualization of electron configuration in the quantum dot system and is therefore called the charge stability diagram .",

    "2(a)-(c ) of ref .  .",
    "the white regimes indicate the coulomb blockade plateaus in which some particular set of electron occupancy @xmath8 is maintained ; the colored lines separating the white regimes represent the electron tunneling changing the occupancy by integer numbers .",
    "[ fitsimmons](a)-(c ) show similar results in si / sige structures , reproduced from fig .",
    "2(c)-(a ) of ref .  .",
    "[ note that the order in the two sets of figures is reversed here to comply with the convention that inter - dot coupling increases from panel ( a ) to panel ( c ) . ]    the tunnel coupling between the two quantum dots can be adjusted by changing the electrostatic potential of the central barrier gate , which consequently affects the geometry of the charge stability diagram .",
    "the variation from panels ( a ) to ( c ) of figs .",
    "[ fitlai ] and [ fitsimmons ] illustrates this process , whose qualitative feature is well understood.@xcite if the central barrier is high enough to well separate the two dots ( so that the coupling between them is weak ) , the two dots behave basically independently and the charge stability diagram has checker board pattern [ fig .",
    "[ fitlai](a ) ] . as the central barrier",
    "is lowered the inter - dot coupling becomes intermediate , the charge stability diagram becomes honeycomb - shaped [ fig .",
    "[ fitlai](b ) , fig .",
    "[ fitsimmons](a ) and ( b ) ] . in fig .",
    "[ fitlai](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fitsimmons](c ) the inter - dot coupling is strong due to further lowering of the central barrier such that the two dots effectively merge into one , the stability diagram becomes like a series of diagonal parallel lines separating regimes with different total occupancy @xmath9 , while the boundaries between different @xmath8 states within the same @xmath10 block [ e.g. @xmath11 are hardly visible due to the hybridization from the quantum fluctuations .",
    "in this situation with inter - dot tunneling induced strong quantum fluctuations , the classical assumption of integer electron filling per dot becomes invalid , thus making the classical circuit model inapplicable .    the prevailing quantitative approach of understanding the charge stability diagram is the capacitance circuit model , which symbolizes the coulomb interaction by capacitors.@xcite in our previous work @xcite we have shown a mapping of the capacitance circuit model to the specific limit of the generalized hubbard model with quantum fluctuations completely suppressed . in fig .",
    "[ fitlai](a ) , the inter - dot coupling including both coulomb interaction and the quantum fluctuations is small , and the capacitance model is , to a good approximation , valid .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fitlai](b ) the boundaries separating different states are rounded near the triple points due to quantum effects , while in fig .",
    "[ fitlai](c ) the quantum effects ( rounding ) become even more evident .",
    "the rounding feature of boundary lines can not even be qualitatively explained in the capacitance model in any way and the basic purpose of the present paper is to give a quantitative description of the experiments using our proposed theoretical approach , combining the generalized hubbard model and the microscopic theory .    in principle , a detailed quantitative theoretical description of a specific experiment needs to incorporate as many experimental parameters as possible extracted directly from the data .",
    "however in our situation several complications arise .",
    "these si quantum dot experiments are done in the multi - electron regime , and the exact electron occupancy @xmath8 is unknown .",
    "while the capacitance model predicts a periodic form of the charge stability diagram , the actual situation is far from clear ( and does not seem periodic ) .",
    "a realistic multi - electron and multi - band calculation would be extremely time - consuming and completely impractical .",
    "therefore we shall focus on the `` effective '' two - electron regime , meaning that we select one diamond in each stability diagram [ indicated as blue square frames in fig .  [ fitlai](a)-(c ) ] , and argue that the electron occupancies in the regime enclosed by the frame ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath12 are approximated by effective electron occupancies ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , although in reality the actual configuration is changing from @xmath8 to @xmath12 with both @xmath15 and @xmath16 being unknown ( and possibly of order 10 - 20 ) .",
    "we shall further assume that the multi - electron multi - band effect can be safely regarded as a renormalization of the effective two - electron and one - band hubbard model parameters such as the coulomb interaction @xmath17 but otherwise the same physics remains.@xcite indeed a close examination of the experimental plots fig .",
    "[ fitlai](a)-(c ) shows that the stability diagrams are , to a good approximation , periodic over a wide range , with details varying slightly as the occupancies are changed .",
    "this indicates that our assumptions are reasonable .",
    "a complete clarification of this multi - electron issue requires further experimental investigation on a much wider range of the stability diagram , new experimental techniques that enable precise measurement of electron occupancies , and a substantially more complicated theoretical and computational study on a multi - band system .",
    "this is far beyond the scope of the present paper and probably the current experiments .",
    "another consequence of the aforementioned approximation is that some of the gate voltages ( for example the plunger gate voltages @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are no longer basic variables in our theory since they control all electrons while electrons in the effective two - electron regime simply feel a different potential which depends on the overall electrostatic potential , the separation between the fabricated gate and the actual localized electron gas , and the underlying fermi sea of the background two - dimensional electron gas in the semiconductor heterostructure . to facilitate the discussion",
    "we adopt the language that is used in the study of gaas devices , i.e. the left and right gate voltages @xmath3 and @xmath4 as the effective gate voltages for si - mos devices .",
    "we will not try to establish a precise connection between @xmath18 and @xmath19 partly because one has no reliable information of the electrons in the underlying fermi sea and partly because the fabrication - induced disorder may come into play .",
    "we shall , however , assume that @xmath19 are related to @xmath18 linearly , i.e. the calculated stability diagram should fit the experimental plot after appropriate rescaling and shifting .",
    "in fact , we have slightly rescaled the @xmath20-direction of the experimental plot of ref .   in fig .",
    "[ fitlai](a)-(c ) since according to our previous work@xcite the boundaries separating different states within the same @xmath10 block [ for example the one separating @xmath21 and @xmath22 regime ] should be at @xmath23 with respect to the @xmath24-axis ( i.e. parallel to the line @xmath25 ) if the mapping to the capacitance model is valid .",
    "the experimental plots shown in ref .",
    "need be compressed along the @xmath20-direction in order to exhibit this property .",
    "this rescaling is simply a matter of convenience and convention , and does not affect any of our results or conclusions .",
    "in addition to the assumptions above , we further assume that the si conduction band valley splitting is sufficiently large at the interface so that the valley degree of freedom can be disregarded .",
    "the neglecting of the valley splitting because of interface effects is the standard approximation in essentially all of the si spin qubit literature with only a few exceptions.@xcite we focus our study on the case without any external magnetic field , but the generalization to the finite magnetic field situation@xcite is straightforward .",
    "in this section we discuss the methods used to model and quantify the experiments .",
    "we first describe the generalized hubbard model , and then the microscopic theory where we use two different models of confinement potentials since the actual quantum dot confinement potential is unknown .",
    "we also briefly outline how we fix the parameters to best describe the experiments .    in our previous publication,@xcite",
    "we have proposed a generalized form of hubbard model , retaining all terms allowed by symmetry ( total particle number @xmath10 and total spin @xmath26 conserved ) .",

    "our motivation at this initial stage of the development of the subject is to keep as few free parameters as possible in the theory and still incorporate quantum fluctuation effects not accessible in the widely used capacitance circuit models .    as discussed in ref .",

    "we start with the biquadratic potential,@xcite @xmath47-\\mu_{1},\\\\ \\frac{m \\omega_2^{2}}{2 } & [ ( x - a)^{2}+y^{2}]-\\mu_{2 } , 0 \\big\\}. \\end{split}\\label{biquadratic}\\ ] ]    the biquadratic potential has a simple form which only involves three parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the inter - dot distance @xmath50 . we expect that the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are directly related to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , while the inter - dot coulomb interaction should vary primarily with the inter - dot distance @xmath50 with possible minor dependence on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this follows from the `` local '' assumption of the electron wave function that the electrons are well localized in their own respective potential wells .",

    "the tunnel coupling @xmath32 is crucial in the double quantum dot system since it implies the exchange interaction , which is essential for many proposals of spin - based quantum computation.@xcite while the exchange interaction can be directly measured experimentally from the singlet / triplet level splitting,@xcite the tunnel coupling @xmath32 is of fundamental theoretical importance as it appears in the hamiltonian matrix . as discussed in ref .",
    ", there are at least two indirect ways to measure @xmath32 : one is through the curvature of the boundary lines , as discussed above in the context of stability diagrams ; the other is according to the width of the probability crossover near the phase boundaries within a subspace of the charge stability diagram , for example the @xmath21 and @xmath22 probability crossing .",
    "the latter strategy has been used in refs .   and",
    ": the crossover of @xmath98 and @xmath99 states leads to an obvious change in the tunneling current which is directly measured by the quantum point contact . then employing a two - level model ( which is essentially a subspace of our more general model ) one extracts the @xmath32 values .",
    ".  4 of ref .   shows such a crossover of the occupancy and its inset shows the extracted values of @xmath32 as a function of the middle gate voltage @xmath100 , whose fitting line is reproduced as the black solid line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ hoppingttt1 ] . as the absolute value of @xmath100 increases ,",
    "the central potential barrier is raised and @xmath32 decreases approximately exponentially .    here",
    "we present a microscopic calculation which shows similar behavior and compare that to the experiments .",
    "we use the biquadratic model potential as it contains fewer free parameters and the inter - dot distance has a simple relation to the height of the potential barrier and the level spacing of the harmonic oscillator : @xmath101 .",
    "since the precise microscopic parameters can not be known from the experiments , we use a range of different harmonic oscillator level spacings , assuming the two dots to be symmetric , and study the tunnel coupling @xmath32 as a function of the height of the central potential barrier @xmath102 .",
    "the results are shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ hoppingttt1 ] : the results of three values of harmonic oscillator level spacing are shown as different symbols with @xmath103mev ( red circles ) , @xmath104mev ( blue squares ) , and @xmath105mev ( green triangles ) . since the calculated value of @xmath32 changes over the entire charge stability diagram , we focus on the center point of the ( 1,1 ) component of the charge stability diagram and compare all cases at that point . to facilitate the comparison to experiments we convert the central barrier height to the effective gate voltage @xmath106 . on the semi - log scale",
    "the data points show an approximately exponential behavior .",
    "the exponential behavior can again be understood from the local nature of the electron wave function : the overlap between two well localized wave function at a distance decreases rapidly as they become either further apart or more localized .",
    "we compare our results calculated at @xmath104 mev ( blue squares ) to experiments in the inset of fig .",
    "[ hoppingttt1 ] .",
    "difficulties arise since , although the experimental middle gate voltage @xmath100 plays a similar role as the central potential barrier of the model potential @xmath102 in our calculation , the quantitative connection between the realistic confinement potential and our model potential is in general unknown .",
    "first , the realistic confinement potential depends on details of the fabrication and the geometry of the specific device , which is difficult to quantitatively describe .",
    "second , the multi - electron multi - band feature in the real situation further complicates the problem . therefore , in our situation , we shall only assume that @xmath100 and @xmath69 [ @xmath107 are related linearly without quantifying the linear coefficients .",
    "in the inset of fig .",
    "[ hoppingttt1 ] the theoretical results are shown as points , utilizing the top @xmath24-scale , while the experimental fitting line is shown as the solid line , using the bottom @xmath24-scale . the @xmath20-scale is shared by both and the @xmath24-scales differ by a proportionality constant and a shift as discussed above .",
    "caution must be taken when interpreting this figure : the perfect fit does not mean that the microscopic parameters used here are the correct ones for the corresponding experiment because of our many simplifying approximations .",
    "the purpose is only to demonstrate that our method is capable of producing the exponential behavior , assuming that @xmath100 and @xmath69 are related linearly .",
    "the precise connection between them is still uncertain .",
    "in fact each group of the three @xmath108 points can be appropriately rescaled to fit the experimental curve .",
    "therefore we only argue that our theory produces the exponential behavior along with appropriate , albeit rough , simplifications , and leave the precise first - principles treatment for future studies .",
    "such a study , which is well beyond the scope of our minimal model , will not only require intensive computational efforts but also necessitate much better characterization of the experimental dots than is currently available .",
    "in conclusion , we have applied the generalized two - site hubbard model approach previously introduced in the gaas symmetric double dot system to the si asymmetric double dot system .",
    "we have calculated the charge stability diagrams from the generalized hubbard model and the microscopic theory with two different models of confinement potentials ( biquadratic and gaussian forms ) , and have found qualitative and quantitative agreement between them and with the experiments on si - mos and si / sige devices .",
    "we have explained in detail the simplifications that we have made to apply our theory , which involves the reduction to the effective two - electron regime@xcite and approximation to the gate voltages .",
    "we have shown that our proposed theoretical hubbard model approach , along with appropriate approximations , provides state - of - the - art quantitative description to the silicon double quantum dot system .",
    "in addition , we have studied in particular the tunnel coupling using the microscopic calculation with biquadratic model potential and have shown that the experimentally observed exponentially decaying behavior with the central potential barrier height is consistent with our theory .",
    "the qualitative success of our minimal theoretical model should motivate further investigations .",
    "first , the full understanding of the multi - electron nature of silicon quantum dot devices requires a multi - band calculation.@xcite in our work we have qualitatively argued on physical grounds that the multi - electron effect imposes simply a renormalization of hubbard parameters in the generalized one - band effective hubbard model,@xcite but a quantitative assessment is lacking .",
    "it is important to understand in - depth how the hubbard parameters change as one translates between different multi - electron regimes , in particular those corresponding to quantum fluctuations which may have non - trivial dependence on the configuration of the base fermi sea .",
    "second , a first - principles poisson - schrdinger theory would be helpful in determining the microscopic confinement potential .",
    "the deficiency of current experiments is that the confinement potential is subject to fabrication - induced disorder and it is hard to extract the precise form of confinement potential reliably .",
    "beyond the hund - mulliken approximation , one can in principle obtain exact solutions to the schrdinger equation for any arbitrary confinement potential , although for some calculations the cost is expensive .",
    "however a complete quantitative understanding will be impossible unless one acquires knowledge beyond the model potential and the effective two - electron regime .",
    "some of the above problems are intractable for current technologies . however , these warrant further study . a key point to appreciate in this context",
    "is the fact that no two sets of double dots are identical from the perspective of microscopic details even when they are fabricated from the same underlying two - dimensional electron structures using the same nominal lithographic protocols .",
    "this is due to many reasons , but a primary one is the invariable presence of unintentional ( and therefore , unknown ) background disorder in the host semiconductor , particularly at the interface where the dots reside",
    ". it may therefore be useless trying to go much beyond our effective minimal model at this stage of materials development in solid state spin qubits since no generic quantitative theory is feasible until the characterization of the quantum dots and their underlying materials science become much more advanced and reproducible than they currently are .",
    "we believe that our minimal model is perhaps the most practical quantum generalization of the classical capacitance model that is feasible at this stage of development of solid state spin qubits in semiconductors .",
