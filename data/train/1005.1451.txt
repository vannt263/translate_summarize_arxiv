    "feedback from star formation is believed to play the essential role to prevent gas from overcooling .",
    "the key question is : where does the feedback from sf throttle gas cooling and condensation ?",
    "we consider three independent lines of evidence to address this question .",
    "first , while metals from supernovae ejecta can be accelerated to velocities exceeding the escape velocity , the whole interstellar gas is very difficult to be blown away , even in starburst galaxies , based on simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "second , observed normal galaxies in the local universe tend to be relatively gas poor ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their progeniors or their building blocks were presumably gas rich in the past when most of the star formation occurred .",
    "this implies that , once gas has collapsed , it would turn into stars on a time scale that is shorter than the hubble time .",
    "finally , if gas were able to collapse inside halos without hinderance , the observed soft x - ray background would be overproduced by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "these three lines of evidence together suggest that feedback from star formation likely exerts its effect outside normal stellar disks , probably in regions that are tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs from halo centers , before too much gas has either been collected inside the virial radius or cooled and condensed onto the disk .",
    "it is currently difficult to fully model gsw in a cosmological simulation , although significant progress has been made to provide a better treatment of the multi - phase interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that a combination of both high resolution and detailed multi - phase medium treatment ( perhaps with the inclusion of magnetic fields and cosmic rays ) is a requisite for reproducing observations .",
    "here we do not attempt to model the _ causes _ and generation of gsw , but , instead , to simply assume an input level of mass , energy and metals , and carefully compute the _ consequences _ of gsw on the surrounding medium and on subsequent galaxy formation .",
    "our simulations have a resolution of @xmath61kpc / h comoving ( see table 1 ) , which may provide an adequate resolution for this purpose , given the aforementioned lines of evidence that feedback from star formation likely exerts most of its effects in regions on scales larger than tens of kiloparsecs . in our simulations , gsw energy and ejected metals",
    "are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the stellar particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell @xcite .",
    "the temporal release of the feedback at time @xmath66 has the following form , all being proportional to the local star formation rate : @xmath67  @xmath68 $ ]  @xmath69 $ ] . within a time step @xmath70 ,",
    "the released gsw energy and mass to the igm from stars are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "we fix @xmath73 , i.e. , 25% of the stellar mass is recycled with the ejecta metallicity of @xmath74 .",
    "metals , collectively having the observed solar abundance pattern , are followed as a separate hydro variable ( analogous to the total gas density or nuetral hydrogen , hei density , heii density ) with the same hydrocode .",
    "we do not introduce any additional  diffusion \" process for the metals .",
    "we note that cooling process is never turned off , before or after the deposition of thermal energy , and hydrodynamic coupling between ejected baryons and surrounding gas is not turned off either , a departure from some of the previous simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is physically made possible in part due to a deposition of energy at scales that are comparable or larger than the sedov radius in our current simulations , thanks to our limited spatial resolution .",
    "-0.5 in -1.0 in    the gsw strength is therefore controlled by one single adjustable parameter , @xmath75 .",

    "our findings are in agreement with @xcite and @xcite in that star formation rate history depends sensitively on the stellar feedback , but in disagreement with @xcite who find otherwise .",

    "there is some indication that a model between  m \" and  l \" might provide a better match to the observations at low redshift ( @xmath84 ) if the compilation of @xcite is used .",
    "but we note that such a model may run into a worse agreement with observations with respect to @xmath82 at @xmath12 .",
    "currently , it is difficult to reconcile the observations of star formation rate history and @xmath82 at @xmath12 .",
    "one might appeal to an evolving imf to provide an attractive reconcilation between the possible discrepancy @xcite .",

    "we attribute this to the uv background used : we have only considered a quasar background , while at these high redshifts the uv radiation coming from galaxies should have a significant effect on the @xmath35 forest .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect this to be an issue on the metal species considered in the following sections .",
    "these correspond to much higher energies than 1  ryd that are not affected by the uv contribution from galaxies to the ionizing radiation .",
    "we generate random synthetic absorption spectra for each of the three absorption lines by producing optical depth distribution along lines of sight parallel to one of the three axes of the simulation box , based on density , temperature and velocity distributions in the simulation ( i.e. , our calculations include redshift effects due to peculiar velocities and thermal broadening ) .",
    "the code used is similar to that used in our earlier papers @xcite .",
    "we identify each absorption line as a contiguous region in the flux spectrum between a down - crossing point and an up - crossing point , both at a flux equal to @xmath89 .",
    "note that flux equal to @xmath90 corresponds to no absorption .",

    "-0.7 in    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     -2.5 in    the second point , perhaps the most overlooked , is that the amount of metals contained in the and absorption line is a very small fraction of the overall metals .",

    "roughly speaking , the amount of metals effectively probed by the line will be larger than the metals directly seen in the line by a factor of @xmath98 ( a similar relation for the line ) .",
    "this ratio @xmath99 for the and line is shown in figure [ fig : fsw ] .",
    "one point worth noting is that for there is an upturn of @xmath99 from @xmath100 at @xmath77 towards high redshift , reaching again the same value at @xmath30 .",
    "this is caused from a transition from more collisionally dominated absorber population at @xmath101 to a more photoionization dominated one at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the trend for the line is much less pronounced , indicative of a dominance of collisionally ionized absorbers over the entire redshift range @xmath0 , with a trend that it is more so at higher redshift .    from the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : omega_metals ] we see that , within a factor of @xmath102 , the amount of metals probed by either or line is roughtly @xmath103 . combining the fact that the majority of -producing regions have not collapsed and virialized ( see figure  [ fig : civdnddelta ] ) and a small fraction of all metals is probed by and lines at all redshifts , and absorbers are  transients \" ; in other words , only a small fraction of metals in the igm get  lit up \" as the or line at any given time . as we demonstrated earlier ,",
    "these regions that produce absorption lines have a set of properties that seem to be created by a combination of physical processes including feedback shock heating and radiative cooling ( see figures  [ fig : spectrum1],[fig : spectrum2],[fig : spectrum3 ] ) .",
    "these close observations suggest that only a fraction of metals at any given time that has recently passed through shocks and cooled to an appropriate temperature shows up as absorption lines . in this sense , absorption lines trace the current feedback processes from star formation and how the current feedback energy and metal - enriched gas interact with the surrounding igm",
    ". similar statements about the transient nature could be made for the line , except that the line corresponds to somewhat different physical states of the shocked regions : they are slightly hotter in temperature and dynamically hotter .",
    "third , returning to figure  [ fig : omegaciv ] , we would like to emphasize that , consistent with recent observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is indeed a sharp drop in @xmath7 from @xmath104 to @xmath105 by a factor of @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "this has less to do with the evolution of the total amount of metals produced , rather it is tracing the phase of gas at any given time .",
    "at redshift @xmath107 , lines at different redshifts appear to come from regions of comparable overdensity ( see figure  [ fig : civdnddelta ] ) and comparable metallicity ( see figure  [ fig : civdndz ] ) .",
    "this allows us to test a very simple physical picture for the origin of lines .",
    "they are produced by regions that were shock heated earlier by feedback shocks and have cooled to the temperature of @xmath108k when they are seen , and the duration of each line in this ",

    "as we noted earlier , the strength of feedback from star formation is chosen to match the observed overall star formation history .",
    "each of the igm components is composed of different regions that have gone through distinct evolutionary paths and thus spans a wide range in density , shown in figure  [ fig : hisrho ] .",
    "the distribution of the cold - warm component ( triangles ) is always peaked at the mean density at all redshifts , reflecting the initial gaussian distribution of gas around the cosmic mean and indicating that the bulk of the igm at mean density or lower has never been shock heated by either strong gravitational shocks or feedback shocks .",

    "this is rather intriguing . in order to properly interpret this interesting phenomenon",
    "it is useful to understand the heating sources of whim .",
    "there are two primary heating sources for whim : shocks due to the collapse of large - scale structure and gsw produced shocks .",
    "earlier works have already shown that gravitational shock heating due to the formation of large - scale structure dominates the energy input for heating up and thus turning about @xmath126 of the igm into whim by @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "this is because the amount of energy from gravitational collapse of large - scale structure as well as the resulting shock velocity decreases steeply towards higher redshift .",
    "the reason for this is simple : in the standard cosmological model the amount of power is peaked at a wavelength of @xmath127mpc / h and drops steeply towards small scales . to quantify the relative contribution of gsw in turning the igm into whim , we compare the simulation with gsw feedback to that without gsw feedback ( run n in table 1 ) .",
    "then , we make the simple assertion that the difference in the amount of whim between the two simulations is due to gsw .",
    "figure  [ fig : gswz ] shows the fraction of whim that is produced ( cumulatively ) by gsw as a function of redshift .",
    "consistent with previous results @xcite , the contribution from gsw to heating up whim by @xmath12 is subdominant at @xmath128 .",
    "this relatively small contribution to whim from gsw can be understood based on simple energetics estimates .",
    "but we see the gsw fraction increases rapidly with increasing redshift . at redshift",
    "@xmath129 the gsw fraction is about @xmath126 , then reaching @xmath130 at @xmath104 and @xmath131 at @xmath132 .",
    "thus , we see the primary heating source of whim at @xmath133 is gsw , whereas gravitational shocks due to structure formation are mostly responsible for heating the whim at @xmath24 .    from figure",
    "[ fig : hisrho ] it seems clear that whim does not distinguish between gravitational shocks and feedback shocks . in both cases shocks have largely stopped at overdensity of about @xmath134 .",
    "let us try to understand why that happened .",
    "first we note that the shocks originate approximately from the central regions of filaments , where pancakes collapse and shock for the case of gravitational shocks and galaxies are generally located for the case of gsw shocks . for gas shock heated to @xmath135k",
    "the shock velocity is roughly @xmath136 . with that velocity",
    "the shock will be able to travel roughly @xmath137kpc comoving over the hubble time at any redshift .",
    "therefore , one should expect to see shocks have reached a few hundred kpc comoving at any redshift , which are about one to a few times the virial radius of typical large galaxies , which in turn correspond an overdensity in the vicinity of @xmath134 and are thus in good agreement with simulation results .",
    "some shocks penetrate deeper into the igm , especially along directions with lower densities and steeper density gradients , as seen in figure  [ fig : civslice ] ; but the amount of mass effected in these low density regions is small , corresponding to the sharp drop of whim mass at the low density end ( figure  [ fig : hisrho ] ) .",
    "this last point is best corroborated by the distribution of the hot gas at high redshift ( @xmath138 ) , in the bottom two panels of figure  [ fig : hisrho ] .",
    "there we see a small amount of hot gas heated up by gsw shocks is indeed produced in regions of density lower than the mean density and traces a larger amount of whim gas that is also produced there . at @xmath139 , some comparable",
    ", small amount of hot gas is still produced at low density regions .",
    "but the vast majority of hot x - ray emitting gas is now residing in the deep potential wells of x - ray clusters of galaxies , when the cluster scale turns nonlinear and collapses .",
    "-1 in    -1 in    having obtained an overview of the thermal history of the igm , we now turn to the metal story",
    ". we will first focus our attention on the whim here , because that is where most of the energy and metal exchanges between galaxies and the igm take place , as shown in figure  [ fig : hisrho ] .",
    "observationally , integrating the observed star formation rate history from high redshift down to @xmath140 suggests that the vast majority ( possibly @xmath141 ) of cosmic metals at @xmath142 appear to be missing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that this conclusion is insensitive to the choice of imf , since both uv light and metals are , to zeroth order , produced by the same massive stars .",
    "metals that have been accounted for in the estimates include those in stars of lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) , damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) and @xmath35 forest , i.e. , cold - warm gas and stars . given the dominant heating of whim by gsw , one may immediately ask : could a significant fraction of metals that accompanies the gsw energy be heated up and in a phase like whim that is different from those where metals have been inventoried ? to better address this open question , we further break down the igm component ( 1 ) ( @xmath115k cold - warm gas ) into two sub - components with ( 1c ) ( @xmath143k cold gas ) and ( 1w ) ( @xmath144k warm gas ) .",
    "the purpose of this finer division is to separate out the cold gas ( 1c ) , which can be more appropriately identified with @xmath35 forest clouds and dlas .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : mtlcompz ] .",
    "we see that about one third of all metals produced by @xmath12 is locked up in stars , decreasing monotonically towards high redshift , dropping to about @xmath145 by @xmath132 .",
    "the fraction of metals in the hot x - ray emitting component is at about @xmath145 level at @xmath12 , plummeting to about @xmath103 at @xmath20 and slowly rising back to about @xmath146 at @xmath30 .",
    "it is likely that the metal fraction in the hot x - ray component at @xmath84 be somewhat underestimated given the relatively moderate simulation boxsize .",
    "the remaining metals are in the general photoionized @xmath35 forest and the whim . at @xmath30",
    "the @xmath35 forest ( @xmath143k , open triangles ) contains about @xmath147 of all metals , while whim ( @xmath148k , open circles ) , and warm igm ( @xmath144k , solid triangles ) contain @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "but the fraction of metals in the @xmath35 forest decreases steadily with time and becomes a minor component by @xmath12 at @xmath151 .",
    "most of the metals is seen to be contained in the whim at all times below redshift five at @xmath152 , peaking at @xmath153 at redshift @xmath154 . in total",
    ", the amount of metals contained in the igm with temperature @xmath155 constitutes about 2/3 of all metals produced by @xmath140 .",
    "metals in this temperature range were not accounted for in the quoted observational inventory at @xmath140 .",
    "thus , it seems probable that the missing metals problem at @xmath14 can be largely rectified , if one counts the metals in the igm at @xmath155k .",
    "by now we have learned that a large amount of metals could be hidden in the whim of temperature @xmath156k spanning a wide range in density .",
    "since the metallicity is a strong function of density , it is still unclear the location of the whim that dominates the missing metals .",
    "figure  [ fig : zrho ] shows the mean metallicity of the three igm components as a function of overdensity at four different redshifts .",
    "it is evident that within each igm component there is a wide range in metallicity that is a non - trivial function of overdensity .",
    "let us examine their behaviors in detail .",
    "for all three igm components there is a strong correlation between the mean metallicity and overdensity at overdensity @xmath2 and they converge at the highest density . while the metallicity of the cold - warm gas at the high density end remains at about solar at high density , its mean metallicity at the low overdensity drops rapidly with increasing redshift .",
    "for example , at @xmath157 , the mean metallicity is ( -2 , -2.5 , -3 , -4 ) in solar units at @xmath158 .",
    "-1.3 in    -1.4 in    one may notice that all three distributions exhibit a minimum metallicity at some intermediate density range , @xmath159 for the cold warm - gas , @xmath157 for the whim and @xmath160 for hot gas ( only at @xmath161 ) .",
    "this is entirely in agreement with the physical picture that we described earlier for the gsw shock propagation through the igm .",
    "figure  [ fig : zrho ] confirms that the transformation of cold gas to whim roughly stops at @xmath157 .",
    "additional metal - enriched gas is further transported along some directions , such as those perpendicular to the filaments , to very low density regions and enrich these regions to higher metallicity ( due to a negligible amount of pre - existing gas there ) .",
    "the behavior of cold and hot components at the low density end can be understood in the same way as the whim .",
    "the metallicity of hot gas at the centers of clusters of galaxies ( at overdensity @xmath162 ) appear to stay in narrow range around @xmath4\\sim -0.5 $ ] over the redshift range @xmath161 , consistent with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is some indication of a still higher metallicity towards higher density regions , which may be in agreement with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity of the whim at the peak of its mass distribution ( @xmath163 ) at @xmath12 is @xmath4\\sim -1 $ ] , in good agreement with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the following formula fits well the metallicity of the whim as a function of overdensity @xmath164 at the redshift range @xmath165 : @xmath166_{whim}=-1.2 - 0.08z + ( 0.3 + 0.12z^{1/3})(\\log\\rho/\\langle\\rho\\rangle -1),\\ ] ] which are shown as the straight lines in the three panels of figure  [ fig : zrho ] .",
    "-1.6 in    -1.6 in    we now examine directly the distribution of metal mass as a function of density for each igm component , shown in figure  [ fig : mtlrho ] .",
    "a very interesting result is that at high redshift ( @xmath138 ) the metals mass in the whim tends to peak at a somewhat lower overdensity than that for the overall whim mass , thanks to the upturn of metallicity of the whim at low overdensity end .",
    "specifically , at @xmath167 it appears that the metals mass peaks at @xmath168 , whereas the total whim mass peaks at @xmath169 .",
    "this trend is reversed at lower redshift ; for example , at @xmath12 the metals in whim is now broadly peaked at @xmath170 , while the whim mass peaks at @xmath169 .",
    "this reversal is likely due to accretion of metal - enriched gas onto high density regions during recent formation of large - scale structures .",
    "quantitatively , we find that , at @xmath140 , only about @xmath171 of the metals in warm and whim gas is located within virialized regions . about @xmath172 of the metals in warm and whim gas resides in the igm with @xmath160 , with the remaining @xmath173 in underdense regions .",
    "this confirms an earlier expectation that some of the missing metals may be in the hot halos of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; but that accounts for only a small fraction of the total missing metals .",
    "combining with our earlier statements on missing metals at @xmath14 , our finding on missing metals is that most of the missing metals are in the warm and whim gas with moderate overdensity broadly distributed between @xmath174 .",
    "-1.0 in    -1.4 in    finally , our attention is turned to the cold - warm component , which displays a dramatic trough at the mean density .",
    "physically , it suggests that gsw does not affect bulk of the igm .",
    "comparisons with observations are useful here to shed light on this dramatic behavior .",
    "we note that the mean metallicity at overdensity @xmath175 drops quickly below @xmath4=-3 $ ] .",
    "the typical @xmath35 forest clouds of column density @xmath176  @xmath177 arise in these moderate density regions .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , our results are at variance with recent measurements of metallicity in these moderate density regions using pod method in the sense that the observed metallicity seems to far exceed what we obtain in our simulations . to illustrate the disagreement we cast the information presented in figures  [ fig : hisrho ] and [ fig : zrho ] into a different form in figure  [ fig : zdelta ] , where we show the evolution of metallicity as a function of redshift at four fixed densities , @xmath178 , for the ease of comparison .",
    "if one compares the middle solid square curve ( the median metallicity at overdensity @xmath134 from our simulations ) and the open squares curve ( the median metallicity at overdensity @xmath134 from observations , @xcite ) , the middle solid dots curve ( the median metallicity at overdensity @xmath90 from our simulations ) and the open circles curve ( the median metallicity at overdensity @xmath90 from observations , @xcite ) , the disagreement is clear and dramatic .",
    "we predict that the metallicity in regions with overdensity less than about @xmath134 generally increases quite rapidly with decreasing redshift , whereas the observationally inferred trend goes in the opposite direction with a mild rate of change .",
    "is our simulation incomplete or are the observations misinterpreted ?",
    "recall from figure  [ fig : civdnddelta ] that the typical overdensity for low column lines is about @xmath134 , comparable to that of @xmath35 forest clouds .",
    "but that is a mere coincidence : the two types of absorbers are generally not co - located in physical space .",
    "if we go back to figures  [ fig : spectrum1],[fig : spectrum2],[fig : spectrum3 ] and study the temperature ( second rows ) and metallicity ( third row ) , we see there is a strong spatial correlation between temperature and metallicity ; regions where a significant amount of reside tend to have an elevated temperature that exceeds @xmath179k , whereas the metallicity in lower temperature regions , where hi reside in abundance to give rise @xmath35 forest clouds , seems extremely low . as we noted earlier , the regions with elevated temperature and civ lines have a width that corresponds to one to several hundred km / s .",
    "interestingly , these regions also typically have peculiar velocities of several hundred km / s ( fourth row from top of figures  [ fig : spectrum1],[fig : spectrum2],[fig : spectrum3 ] ) . as a result",
    ", there should be some overlap in velocity space between some lines and @xmath35 forest lines , even when they are significantly displaced in physical space . this overlap may  diffuse \" , in velocity space , some of the metals in regions that producing lines into the @xmath35 forest lines , causing an apparent , moderate metallicity level in @xmath35 forest , as inferred by @xcite ) , when a method such as pod is employed .    a closer look at the left panel of figure  [ fig : civdndz ] indicates that typical absorbers show a decrease of metallicity with decreasing redshift in the range @xmath180 : roughly @xmath4=[-2.0,-1.5],[-2.3,1.4],[-2.6,-1.5]$ ] at @xmath181 .",
    "this is in accord with the observed weak trend of increasing metallicity with increasing redshift , which otherwise is extremely difficult to understand in the context of the standard cosmological model .",
    "needless to say , the lines located in regions that are spatially close to lines will also  diffuse \" into the @xmath35 forest in velocity space .",
    "the fact that lines tend to have a higher metallicity , about @xmath4=0.2 $ ] to @xmath182 , than the lines over the redshift range of @xmath183 ( comparing the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : civdndz ] ) and there are more lines than lines ( comparing the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : civdndz ] ) would suggest that one may expect that the apparent oxygen abundance in the @xmath35 forest inferred from pod should be higher than that of lines .",
    "this is indeed the case : @xcite found that @xmath184=0.66^{+0.06}_{-0.2}$ ] .",
    "we argue that this provides independent , supporting evidence for our explanation that is self - consistent and physically plausible .",
    "alternatively , the igm may be enriched to the observed level by first generation , pop iii galaxies that are not properly captured in our simulations .    to further test our `` diffusion '' hypothesis ,",
    "we have computed the cross - correlation between @xmath35 , and spectra and taken the mean along all lines of sight at @xmath185 for two cases : run `` m '' of our simulations with and without the effect of peculiar velocities taken into account .",
