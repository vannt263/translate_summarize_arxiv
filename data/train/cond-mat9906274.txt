    "the ashkin - teller neural network ( atnn ) studied recently by us in the case of loading of a finite number of patterns ( @xcite and references therein ) can be considered as a non - trivial generalisation of the hopfield model @xcite to allow for different types of neurons .",
    "it can be seen as a model consisting of two hopfield models interacting through a four - neuron term , or it can be interpreted as a neural network with two types of neurons at each site having different functions .    some of the underlying neurobiological motivation for the introduction of different types of neurons is the fact that there exist areas in the brain which react to two different kinds of dependent stimuli in such a way that the response to particular combinations of these stimuli is stronger than the response to others @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in neuropsychological studies on amnesia it has become appreciated that memory is composed of multiple separate systems which can store different types of information , e.g. , information based on skills and information based on specific facts or data @xcite .",
    "in addition , the classical ashkin - teller model on which our atnn model is based , appears in studies of disordered systems when the disorder evolves on a time scale that can be tuned @xcite . finally , two different types of neurons show up naturally when considering the hopfield model with synchronous dynamics @xcite .    storage and retrieval of embedded patterns built from these two types of neurons with different degrees of (",
    "in)dependence have been discussed in @xcite for finite loading , i.e. the capacity @xmath0 , defined as the number of embedded patterns , @xmath1 , versus the size of the system , @xmath2 , is taken to be zero . in that study we wanted to find out , e.g. , whether the four - neuron interaction between the two types of neuron can improve the retrieval process . and indeed , it has been seen that interesting retrieval behaviour emerges , especially for linked patterns , e.g. , different types of mattis states occur , a higher retrieval transition temperature is possible , the quality of retrieval is improved through a bigger overlap .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the properties of this model for infinite loading of patterns , i.e. , for @xmath3 .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .    after describing the atnn - model in section  2 we use the standard replica mean - field theory approach in order to write down its free energy in section  3 . assuming replica symmetry we then obtain the fixed - point equations for the relevant order parameters .",
    "thermodynamic and retrieval properties are discussed in section  4 .",
    "in particular , section  4.1 investigates the behaviour of the model at zero temperature for equal two- and four - neuron coupling strengths in the hamiltonian . in this case",
    "also the entropy is calculated and found to be negative .",
    "this leads to a discussion about the size of the replica - symmetry breaking and re - entrance behaviour .",
    "section  4.2 presents phase diagrams in the temperature - capacity plane for different values of the two- and four - neuron coupling strengths .",
    "a number of new features in these diagrams show up .",
    "also the maximal information content of the network is obtained as a function of these couplings .",
    "where relevant , the results are compared with the hopfield model @xcite and with the four - state potts model @xcite .",
    "finally , section  5 presents some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath2 sites each with two different types of binary neurons @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the interactions between the neurons are determined by the infinite - range hamiltonian @xmath6        \\ , .",

    "all @xmath14 are non - negative .",
    "first , we remark that the above definition of @xmath15 is equivalent to the case of linked patterns considered in @xcite .",
    "second , we repeat that this model can be considered as an assembly of two hopfield models ( when @xmath16 ) interconnected via a four - neuron interaction ( when @xmath17 ) .",
    "in order to determine the thermodynamic and retrieval properties of the model we calculate the quenched free energy per site within the replica - symmetric mean - field theory approach . using standard techniques",

    "our convention is that they have to be taken different in the equations above .",
    "solving this set of equations is a tedious task . in the following sections we discuss these solutions that are important for the thermodynamic and retrieval properties of the model , i.e. , mattis retrieval states and spin - glass states . at this point",
    "we remark that in the @xmath39 limit the replica - symmetric solution of the atnn model presented above is completely consistent with the corresponding result obtained in @xcite .",
    "the solution of the fixed - point equations for the atnn neural network model presented in the previous section depends , of course , on the values of the coupling strengths @xmath40 . without loss of generality we put @xmath41 in the sequel .",
    "such a choice is very often used in the literature concerning classical ( @xcite and references therein ) and spin - glass @xcite ashkin - teller models .",
    "this model contains as particular limits the hopfield network for any two @xmath40 equal to zero , the four - state clock network @xcite ( or , equivalently , two independent hopfield networks ) for any @xmath42 and a model strongly resembling the four - state potts network @xcite for @xmath43 .",
    "remark , however , that only the strength of the couplings is the same but , in general , @xmath44 ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , some details of the phase diagram compared with those of the potts network may be different .",
    "the type of solutions we are interested in , at first instance , are mattis solutions , for which not more than one component of each order parameter @xmath45 is non - zero . as in @xcite we thereby distinguish two types of mattis states .",
    "simple mattis states where only the same components of the @xmath45 are non - zero , e.g. , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and crossed mattis states where the same components of the @xmath45 are never non - zero , e.g. , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "these states are denoted by @xmath51 in the sequel .",
    "all these mattis retrieval solutions also have non - zero values of the ea order parameters @xmath31 .",
    "we remark that we have also found mattis states where only one @xmath45 and the corresponding @xmath31 are non - zero . these are , in fact , hopfield - like solutions .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in spin - glass ( sg ) states characterised by @xmath52 , @xmath53 ( here also hopfield - like sg states are possible ) and a paramagnetic state with all order parameters @xmath52 , @xmath54 .",
    "first it is worthwhile to discuss the most simple case , i.e. , zero temperature with equal coupling strengths .",
    "second we present results for non - zero temperatures and arbitrary couplings .",
    "restricting ourselves first to @xmath43 we find that only solutions with equal order parameters , @xmath55 and @xmath56 exist .",
    "further , considering simple mattis states at zero temperature the set of fixed - point equations ( [ m])-([r ] ) can be reduced to a single equation , as in @xcite @xmath57               \\nonumber\\\\    \\fl \\hspace*{0.5cm}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{-x\\sqrt{2}}{\\rm d}z        \\left [ { \\rm erf}^2\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}+2x\\right ) +           { \\rm erf}^2\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right]\\left [                 1-zx\\sqrt{2}\\right ]            -x\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\left(1+e^{-2x^2}\\right )           \\label{xeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the new variable @xmath58 being different from zero only when @xmath59 . thus the range in @xmath60 allowing the existence of non - zero solutions of eq .",
    "( [ xeq ] ) determines the critical capacity , @xmath61 , of the atnn model with equal coupling strenghts at @xmath62 . numerically solving this equation for different values of @xmath0 we find @xmath63",
    "this is higher than the critical capacity of the hopfield model ( @xmath64 ) @xcite and agrees ( up to numerical precision ) with the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the four - state potts neural network after an appropriate rescaling with the number of couplings as discussed in @xcite .",
    "( the relation between the hopfield and potts critical capacities is given in eq .",
    "( 19 ) of @xcite . )",
    "we remark that taking the coupling strengths @xmath40 unequal always leads to a smaller critical capacity , as we will see in the next subsection .",
    "the phase diagram of the atnn model is obtained by numerically solving the set of fixed - point equations ( [ m])-([r ] ) .",
    "it is a complicated function of @xmath41 , @xmath75 , and @xmath0 , the behaviour of which we analyse by looking specifically at @xmath76 sections for different values of the ratio @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the maximal information content of the network in the full space of couplings .",
    "an extensive numerical analysis allows us to distinguish essentially two qualitatively different @xmath76 sections of the full phase diagram .",
    "they are shown in figs .",
    "[ diag ] and [ diag1 ] .",
    "several transition lines bordering different phases show up .",
    "the lines @xmath78 and @xmath79 are related to simple mattis solutions , the line @xmath80 separates the sg and paramagnetic solutions .",
    "the lines @xmath81 and @xmath82 are connected with crossed states .",
    "finally , the lines @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 have to do with the hopfield - like retrieval and sg solutions introduced before .",
    "we remark that from now on writing that a solution exists also implies that it is stable within the replica - symmetric approximation , unless stated otherwise .",
    "let us first discuss fig .",
    "[ diag ] where the coupling strenghts are all equal , and hence @xmath86 , in more detail .",
    "we start looking at high @xmath87 expressed in units of @xmath88 .",
    "the transition from the disordered paramagnetic phase to the sg - phase ( @xmath52 , @xmath89 ) is continuous and denoted by @xmath80 .",
    "when crossing the line @xmath78 simple mattis retrieval states show up as local minima of the free energy . at these points",
    "the overlap with the embedded patterns jumps from zero to a finite macroscopic value .",
    "so the system functions as an associative memory and the critical storage capacity for a given temperature can be read off through that line .    when further lowering @xmath87 the simple mattis states become global minima of the free energy .",
    "this happens along the line @xmath79 and this thermodynamic transition is first order .",
    "here we note that the critical lines @xmath79 and @xmath80 end in different temperature points at @xmath39 giving rise to a `` crossover '' region for small @xmath0 as it occurs in the potts model @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that for @xmath39 this atnn model with @xmath86 has a discontinuous transition at @xmath79 as shown in @xcite ( see in particular fig .  5 ) . in this crossover region",
    "the simple mattis states ( global minima ) and the paramagnetic state ( local minimum ) coexist .",
    "finally , at still lower @xmath87 ( and appropriate values of @xmath0 ) crossed states of the type @xmath90 and @xmath91 exist left from the line @xmath82 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "their free energy is bigger than that of the simple mattis states .",
    "we end the discussion of this phase diagram by remarking that we find weak re - entrant behaviour both at the lines @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "the re - entrance at the line @xmath79 is somewhat stronger and may suggest @xcite a greater replica - symmetry breaking of the sg - solution , in agreement with the values of the zero - temperature entropy calculated in section  4.1 .",
    "furthermore the greatest capacity of the atnn model with equal coupling strengths is obtained for temperature @xmath92 and reads @xmath93 .    in figs .",
    "[ msimple ] and [ mcross ] we present some typical overlap profiles for simple and crossed mattis states in this model indicating the stability of the solutions within the replica - symmetric approximation ( i.e. , indicating where the solution is a minimum of the replica - symmetric free energy ) .",
    "we see that , for the same values of @xmath87 and @xmath0 the simple states always have the largest overlap .",
    "next , we turn to a discussion of the phase diagram for the atnn model with unequal coupling strengths .",
    "we explicitly consider the situation of fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] where @xmath94 ( meaning that the four - neuron term has four times the strength of the two - neuron one ) . starting from high @xmath87",
    "we first meet the ( new ) line @xmath84 marking the continuous transition from the disordered paramagnetic phase to a sg1-phase where only one of the @xmath31 is non - zero , i.e. the hopfield - like sg - state , @xmath52 , @xmath95 . when lowering @xmath87 and taking @xmath0 sufficiently small the ( new ) line @xmath83 appears below which solutions with only one @xmath45 and corresponding @xmath31 different from zero , i.e. , hopfield - like mattis states exist as local minima of the free energy . below the thermodynamic first order transition line @xmath85 they become global minima of the free energy .",
    "these hopfield phases exist in the interval @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "the rest of the lines which are present are similar to the ones of fig .",
    "[ diag ] whereby we remark that the simple mattis states are now of the form @xmath97 .",
    "however , crossing the line @xmath78 from within the hopfield - like retrieval phase we observe that the overlap @xmath98 continuously increases from zero . outside",
    "this region @xmath98 immediately jumps from zero to a finite macroscopic value as is the case in diagram  [ diag ] .",
    "furthermore , crossed mattis states of the type @xmath97 have become unstable for this value of @xmath99 whereas the crossed states of type @xmath91 exist for all @xmath100 .",
    "sections of the full phase diagram for different values of the ratio @xmath99 are qualitatively not much different and can be explained by taking the diagram fig .",
    "[ diag ] with @xmath86 as a reference .    when @xmath99 is increasing ( starting at the value @xmath101 ) , meaning that the coupling strength of the four - neuron interaction becomes smaller , the crossover region shrinks since the endpoints of the lines @xmath80 and @xmath78 come closer .",
    "it finally shrinks to zero for @xmath102 meaning that one is left with two independent hopfield models .",
    "the region where the crossed solutions @xmath91 are found gets larger such that the line @xmath81 moves to the right until it finally coincides with the line @xmath78 .",
    "the shapes of the transition lines are deforming continuously in such a way that they resemble more and more the hopfield - model transition lines and finally they become identical with the latter .    when decreasing @xmath99 from the value @xmath101 the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] evolves to the one presented in fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] .",
    "the gap between the lines @xmath78 and @xmath80 for @xmath39 is increasing and hopfield - like phases appear .",
    "when further decreasing @xmath99 the gap still grows until it reaches the maximal value @xmath101 in units of @xmath103 and the hopfield phase occupies a larger part of the phase diagram to become completely dominating in the limit @xmath104 where the pure hopfield model is found .",
    "this means that the lines @xmath80 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 shrink and disappear as @xmath105 and as a result the lines @xmath83 and @xmath85 become equal to the corresponding lines of the pure hopfield model .    finally , in order to have an idea about the amount of information stored in the network we have to take into account both the value of the capacity and the retrieval overlap .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite based upon the shannon entropy @xcite .",
    "this leads straightforwardly to the following information content per number of couplings per spin @xmath106 \\ , .\\ ] ] we remark that only @xmath107 appears in this formula since for @xmath41 we recall that @xmath98 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath108 for all @xmath109 and fig .",
    "5 shows its maximal value , @xmath110 , as a function of @xmath103 and @xmath111 .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , we find that the maximal information content is reached for values of @xmath0 slightly smaller than @xmath112 .",
    "second , the greatest information , i.e. @xmath113 , is obtained for equal coupling strenghts .",
    "third , for @xmath102 we find a constant information content independent of @xmath114 which is equal to the one in the hopfield model at zero temperature .",
    "this hopfield value is @xmath115 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath116 in fig .  5 in view of the rescaling with @xmath117 due to the different number of couplings per spin . finally , for @xmath104 and @xmath118 the critical capacity is equal to the hopfield value and zero for @xmath119 but the information content is continuously going to zero as @xmath103 tends to @xmath120",
    "this is due to the fact that the overlap @xmath98 corresponding to maximal information goes continuously to zero .",
    "in this paper we have studied the thermodynamic and retrieval properties of the atnn neural network model storing an infinite number of patterns using replica - symmetric mean - field theory .",
    "this analysis extends our results for this model in the case of low loading @xcite .",
    "we have derived the free energy and fixed - point equations for the relevant order parameters and have obtained the phase diagram for arbitrary values of the coupling strength of the two- and four - neuron interactions .",
    "this model can be considered as the sum of two interacting binary networks such that it contains the hopfield model when some of the couplings go to zero . for equal coupling strengths this model",
    "strongly resembles the four - state potts neural network .    the storage capacity defined as the number of patterns per number of couplings per spin is maximal for equal coupling strenghts and equal to @xmath121 .",
    "in that case the maximal information content per coupling is @xmath122 versus @xmath115 for the hopfield model .",
    "different retrieval characteristics can be distinguished in the phase diagram depending on the parameters of the network .",
    "first , the two types of embedded patterns are retrieved and the retrieval quality is enhanced by the interaction between the networks .",
    "these retrieval states are the simple mattis states .",
    "second , the two types of embedded patterns are retrieved but with lower precision because of the presence of this interaction .",
    "these retrieval states are the crossed states of the type @xmath91 and @xmath90 .",
    "they do not play an important role in the thermodynamics of the model .",
    "third , a pure hopfield - like phase is present indicating the retrieval of only one kind of pattern .",
    "these results allow us to mention some possible biological applications of this model .",
    "patterns related with two different order parameters may be seen as a representation for two different stimuli , e.g. , two visual ones as shape and colour , or two different ones as colour and flavour .",
    "when these two stimuli are somehow linked , e.g. , through the fact that they were experienced at the same time , it is very likely that they will be recalled together , what corresponds to a suggestion in ref .  @xcite that particular combinations of stimuli are favoured .",
    "finally , we remark that there is some re - entrant behaviour in the phase diagram at low temperatures which points at replica - symmetry breaking effects .",
    "calculation of the zero - temperature entropy supports the expectation that this breaking is weak .    in brief , the presence of a four - neuron coupling term in the atnn model not only enhances the quality of pattern retrieval ( by giving a larger overlap at higher temperatures ) , as present already in the case of low loading @xcite , but it also increases the critical capacity and the maximal information content in comparision with the hopfield model .",
