    "( 2009 , hereafetr va09 ) found that more massive galaxies show very little evolution since a lookback time of 9 @xmath5 , having evolved fastly in the past -which supports again the _ downsizing _ framework . on the other side , prez - montero et al .",

    "other cosmological simulations , including winds , by dav , finlator & oppenheimer ( 2011 ) explained the slow dropping of gas fractions and slow rise of metallicity with time ( at given mass ) as a result of an increasing metallicity in the accreted gas , inflowing at a rate that decreases faster than the gas depletion rate .",
    "in general the origin of a zm sequence has been linked to the higher efficiency of sn outflows at expelling metal - enriched gas in lower mass galaxies ( see arimoto & yoshi 1987 , gallazzi et al .",

    "in particular , calura et al .",
    "( 2009 ) demonstrated that it can arise as a natural by - product of the increasing efficiency of star formation ( parametrized as sfr per unit mass of gas ) with galaxy mass , without need to invoke gas outflows producing metal losses in less massive galaxies .",
    "similar conclusion were reached by va09 , whilst gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that neglecting winds does not correctly reproduce the observations .    in any case ,",
    "toy models without sn feedback nor winds ( so called _ closed box _ ) have proven to result into early metal overproduction in low - mass galaxies and hence a too flat zm relation ( see brooks et al .",
    "2007 ) , or into a general overestimated metallicity at all masses at high redshift ( de rossi , tissera & scannapieco 2007 , finlator & dav 2008 ) .",

    "romeo et al .",

    "indeed discrepancies arise in the available data about the dependence of the zm relation on the sfr : relatively to local sdss samples , e08 had deduced a dependence of the zm relation on ssfr at lower masses ( @xmath8 ) , according to which galaxies with higher ssfr have lower gas - phase metallicities for a given stellar mass by a factor @xmath90.1 dex respect to the less star - forming ; they impute this to different star formation efficiencies , in the sense that more intense past star - forming activity would yield higher present gas metallicity but lower current ssfr , inasmuch as more gas had been previously depleted . in sharp contrast to them ,",
    "lara - lpez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found instead a shallow yet positive correlation between sfr and metallicity at low redshift , by virtue of which high sfr galaxies tend to have higher metallicities .",
    "yates , kauffmann & guo ( 2012 ) explain this result with a semi - analytical model by which passive and massive galaxies have exhausted their gas reservoirs during a recent major merger , that inhibited further star formation .",
    "all in all , there remain still open two compelling questions about the evolution of the zm relation : 1 ) whether it is mainly driven by galactic winds or just by the natural trend of the galaxy star formation history , and 2 ) whether the variation of its slope with redshift is more compatible with _ downsizing _ or with hierarchical assembling of stellar mass in galaxies . in this paper",
    "we aim at studying both the absolute variation of metallicity with mass at different redshifts ( the _ evolution _ of the zm relation ) , and the evolution of its slope as well .",
    "the latter gives more precise indications about how the almost monotonic increase of metallicity with time at given mass depends in turn on the galaxy mass itself , hence represents an optimal diagnostic tool to shed light on both the questions aforementioned .",
    "in this work we will consider two galaxy classes , according to their ssfr : star - forming and passive galaxies , separated by redshift - dependent thresholds mimicking the observed rs evolution ( see section 3 ) .",
    "caution has to be warned about coping with passive and star - forming objects within the same framework , since metallicity is measured by different methods in either of these : most of the observational data we are going to compare with , refer to inter - stellar galactic metallicity , that is commonly expressed in terms of oxygen abundance and derived from nebular emission lines in gas - rich or star - forming galaxies . for local ellipticals instead",
    "a luminosity - weighted stellar zm is rather employed by aid of ssp synthesis models ( see thomas et al .",
    "current semi - analytical studies can employ either the stellar metallicity @xmath10 ( e.g. pipino et al .",
    "2009 and va09 ) or the gaseous one ( sakstein et al . 2011 ) . in general , besides to being less prone to spectroscopic bias , as an intrinsic parameter the stellar metallicity allows to probe metallicities at different epochs of galaxy evolution , which is this paper s main scope",
    ".    moreover , gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have demonstrated a zm relation holding with stellar metallicities , even though with an offset to lower values than nebular ones .",
    "finlator & dav ( 2008 ) confirmed that the metallicity of the parent gas cloud is mostly tracked by younger galaxies , whose uv - only luminosity - weighted metallicity overestimates by 50% the mean values in ssps .",
    "the main difference is that bolometric stellar metallicity traces all the past metal enrichment as result of an extended star formation history , whereas nebular metallicity ( or uv - only luminosity - weighted metallicity ) rather only mirrors the more recent star forming episodes ( see also sommariva et al .",
    "2012 ) . as a consequence",
    ", we prefer to rely on stellar metallicities as a more suitable parameter to combine with the other relevant one : the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) , defined as the aggregate sfr over the _",
    "final _ stellar mass of the galaxy at that redshift , i.e. calculated at the same time as the galaxy age .",
    "in the simulations here presented we consider as standard recipe that with  super - winds \" scheme , that has proven to successfully reproduce many of the chemical and thermal properties of the igm ( romeo et al .",
    "2006 : figs .",
    "13 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 19 therein demonstrate that models with weak stellar feedback are inadequate to account for the abundance levels of the igm in clusters or groups ) .",
    "in particular , the star - to - igm iron mass ratio in the models without outflows is strongly skewed towards a five times higher metal content locked up into stars than in the outer gas ( at @xmath0=0 ) ; this means that whatever _ closed box _",
    "model tends by its nature to heavily overestimate stellar metallicity , as well as the ism gaseous one ( see below ) .",
    "our scheme works as follows : gas and metal galactic outflows are triggered by starburst episodes , their strength being proportional to the fraction of stars partaking in each starburst .",
    "each star particle hosts a single stellar population ( ssp ) of total mass corresponding to the stellar mass resolution of the simulation , that in this work is @xmath11 .",
    "the individual stellar masses are distributed according to an arimoto - yoshi imf .",
    "each of these ssps represents a coeval and chemically homogeneous stellar population , characterized by its age and metallicity .",
    "the newborn stars evolve according to the imf chosen and feed energy back to the ism mostly by means of sn ii : the energy from sn ii is transferred to the ism as thermal , whence a fraction is converted into kinetic energy of the expanding fronts .    at the same time , stars return to the surrounding gas also chemically processed material , leading to an increase in its cooling rate .",
    "the resulting stellar feedback is then the combination of energy ( given by sn rate ) and metal release . during the ssp lifetime , energy and metals",
    "are thus injected into the gas , according to a stochastical return model .",
    "the whole cycle gas - stars consistently follows the birth and evolution of the ssps and their final `` decay '' again into gas particles through feedback mechanism ; the latter will in turn regulate further episodes of star formation , and so forth .",
    "all the chemical yields are calculated within a _ non - instantaneous recycling _ model , taking into account the stellar timescales .",
    "more details about the cosmological and sph simulation are available in romeo et al .",
    "2006 and 2008 .",
    "new galaxy - finding algorithms have been implemented on the top of the original simulations .",
    "it is worth stressing that most of theoretical works on the subject , as well as many observational extrapolations at higher redshifts , have been developed under significant approximations : either the _ closed box _ ( e.g. va09 , tdrs05 , de rossi , tissera & scannapieco 2007 , s05 ) or the instantaneous recycling chemical evolution ( va09 ) .",
    "remarkable exceptions are for example dav , finlator & oppenheimer ( 2011 ) , who ran n - body + sph simulations within the same rezooming paradigm as ours and adopting similar physical modules ; they focussed however on field galaxies and in addition experimented variable winds .",
    "the individual galaxies selected are then assigned a luminosity as the sum of the luminosities of its constituent star particles , in the classical broad bands _",
    "ubvrijhk_. for each ssp , luminosities are computed by mass - weighted integration of the padova isochrones ( girardi et al .",
    "thus the physically meaningful quantities of our data are age and metallicity , from which colours are derived .",
    "all results are here presented for ( total , o and fe ) mass - weighted metallicities , but data are also available for si and mg and for luminosity - weighted metallicity as well .",
    "the targets selected from the cosmological simulation were one cluster of @xmath12 kev , one of @xmath13 kev and 12 groups ( @xmath14 kev ) , four of which fossil .",
    "the two clusters are in different dynamical stages of their evolution , being the larger less relaxed and hence dynamically younger ( undergoing the last major merger at @xmath60.8 ) than the smaller ( for which the last major merger occurred at @xmath61.5 ) ; notwithstanding , we have stacked their galaxies together aiming at reproducing the natural cosmic variance observed at any epoch .",
    "all simulated galaxies belong to a class of environment , which in the clusters is a function of radial cluster - centric distance , corresponding to regions inside and outside a threshold radius of @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) .",
    "all in all , there are four classes of galaxies : the two cluster cores ( in ) , the two cluster outskirts ( out ) , the eight normal groups ( ng ) and the four fossil groups ( fg ) .",
    "the issue of defining a consistent selection of rs members to be compared with observations at different redshifts , is a crucial one . to this purpose ,",
    "we have considered two different galaxy samples : + 1 ) the _ dead sequence _ sample ( ds ) , which belong to all and only those galaxies having ssfr below a threshold that has been defined as slowly progressive with redshift : from @xmath17 ( at @xmath0=0 ) to @xmath18 ( at @xmath0=2 ) @xmath19 . by virtue of its colour - independent definition ,",
    "the ds may be considered as the model equivalent of the observed rs ( see r08 ) .",
    "+ 2 ) the star - forming sample ( sf ) , comprising galaxies having ssfr higher than the above threshold value .",
    "these objects correspond to the _ blue cloud _ in the colour - magnitude plane ( see r08 ) .",
    "we are using a separation in specific sfr ( @xmath20 ) , rather than sfr _ tout court _ , because the former is a parameter closer to the star formation _ efficiency _ , defined as proportional to @xmath21 ( see e.g. sakstein et al .",

    "2013 ) .",
    "the redshift dependence of the threshold is empirically mimicking the decreasing sfr with time ( see e.g. lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) , and is quantitatively equivalent to common parametrizations used in s.a.m .",
    "( see again sakstein et al .",

    "2004 ) .    as a general matter",
    ", any comparison with and between data is affected by both aperture effects and by different metallicity indicators used : this is true up to the extent that it is seldom possible to place different samples on the same metallicity scale , due to the lack of conversion factors between the indicators ( see erb06 , foster et al . 2012 ,",
    "the estimation of the global trend of the zm relation at different cosmological epochs is possible only through the analysis of statistically signicant samples , provided that consistently adopting the same calibrations : in particular pm09 warn against a selection bias towards galaxies with bright emission lines and hence lower metallicities , while andrews & martini ( 2013 ) claim that the commonly used method of strong line ratios needs a complicate empirical calibration resulting into an indirect approximation to real metallicities .    due to internal metallicity gradients in galaxies ( see tortora et al . , 2011 ) ,",
    "also the choice of aperture is critical in order to compare with observational results : ellison & kewley ( 2005 ) calculated that different apertures in the sdss can account for a @xmath25 dex offset between nuclear and integrated metallicities .",
    "this may lead to an uncertainty in the metallicity which is approximately of a factor twice , that is about the same as the observed difference between the amplitudes of the zm relation for @xmath62 and local galaxies ( erb06 )",
    ". however , ellison et al . ( 2009 , hereafter e09 ) have demonstrated that the zm relation with stellar metallicity is much less affected by aperture cuts in terms of half light radii , than that with nebular gas metallicity .    throughout this work",
    ", the colours of our brightest central galaxies ( bcg , or cd ) were corrected using fractional apertures in terms of the virial radius ( that is , 0.003 - 0.008@xmath26 , being @xmath26 decreasing with redshift : the resulting value is approximately equivalent to @xmath27 for the cd ) , in order to cut the diffuse envelope out ; thus was excluded the intra - cluster stellar component , whose profile can often be superposed to the extended bcg one ( see sommer - larsen , romeo & portinari , 2005 , for more details about ) .",
    "moreover we cut the innermost 10 kpc out of the bcgs , since in many cases the presence of excess young stellar populations therein affects the galaxy colour resulting in a bluer position within the colour - magnitude plane ( see r08 ) .",
    "consequently , the whole cds were accounted for as to their magnitude and the aperture - corrected ones as to their colour . finally , as anticipated in the introduction",
    ", we can choose to model our results in terms of the gaseous or the stellar metallicities , that are more suitable to describe , respectively , the star - forming or the passive galaxies .",
    "however , in order to attain a more consistent description that be valid for both samples , and also due to the larger uncertainties met in binding the gas particles to the galaxy stellar component within a self - consistent radius , in the following we will limit our analysis to the stellar metallicities only -with the exception of subsection 4.3 , where results for the gas abundances are presented as well for reference .",

    "apart of the normalization , the evolution of the two galaxy populations can be followed across time : a passive sequence of low - metallicity galaxies starts to being built at least from @xmath0=2 and from the low - mass side ; higher - metallicity and higher - mass objects begin to fall down onto this passive sequence just after @xmath0=2 , filling the mass gaps until completing the horizontal sequence at around @xmath0=0.7 . at the same time",

    "it is highest in cluster cores ( concording with results by e09 ) and lowest in ngs : this may be correlated with the later lasting star formation activity in the latter systems , as found in r08 .",

    "the difference in metallicity between massive and faint galaxies is more marked in the ds sample , where it amounts to twice at almost all epochs ( fig.[slods ] ) .    from the comparison between our two classes ( fig .",
    "[ ratsf ] ) , we can evince that the characteristic metallicity in sf galaxies taken at @xmath74=10.5 is slightly higher than that of ds at all epochs ; when estimated at @xmath74=9.5 instead , it is slightly lower for @xmath20.7 for sf galaxies than in passive ones , but with an inversion at around that epoch , after which it gets considerably higher until recent times .",
    "such trend for @xmath640.7 is imputable to low - mass metal - rich galaxies contributing to flatten the slope of the zm relation in the sf sample .",
    "\\10 ) the effect of galactic winds triggered by sn events acts as to ejecting from the galaxy gas particles having higher metallicity than those of the star forming gas and than the star particles as well ( fig.[outflow ] ) .",
    "this translates into a lowered galaxy abundance and is presumably enhanced in lower - mass systems , where the outflows attain higher radial velocities -ultimately contributing to differentially change the zm slope .",
    "+ to summarize , we find a zm relation that is basically determined in its shape and evolution by its parametrization in terms of ssfr , that is ultimately function of star forming efficiency ( sfe ) . moreover ,",
    "a stronger evolution is reported for the metallicity of more massive and passive galaxies in cluster cores . among the star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the sfe is higher at lower mass at any epoch , while the ds galaxies present both sfr and ssfr independent of mass .",
    "in addition to the natural variations of sfe , the role of galactic outflows is also shown as contributing to the global evolution of the zm relation , even though its statistical effect is hard to assess on a global ( rather than sub - grid ) scale .",
    "thus , the effect of mechanisms helping to recycle metals more efficiently in the igm , at the same time hampering the star formation , can not be neglected : processes in our simulations working towards this direction are either post - starburst strong winds triggering shocks , or dynamical heating due to the hierarchical growth , e.g. ( dry ) merging and galaxy encounters .",
    "the latter mechanisms have been shown in r08 to be rather relevant above @xmath281 ( see bgg mass growth in their fig .",
    "9 ) and in dense environments and this could actually explain the steeper slope profiles of cluster cores and groups with respect to the cluster outskirts earlier than that epoch ( fig.[slods]@xmath39 ) .",
    "in fact , massive ds systems in cluster outskirts show steep zm at all epochs ( fig [ slods]@xmath39 ) : such non - evolving zm slope is a feature from our simulations for which we have not direct observational counterpart as currently evidences generally come from mixed environments .",
    "moreover , they reach their maximum metallicity only at @xmath60 , what suggests that here outflows acting to dissipate the metal accumulation are less efficient than in cluster cores .",
    "these results indicate that during the dynamical phase of cluster pre - virialization some form of internal heating is relevant .",
    "our simulations do not explicitely model agn feedback : nevertheless , the role of agn energy feedback in our simulations can be mimicked by the enhanced winds originating from post-(gas - rich)-merger starbursts associated with simultaneous sn - ii events .",
    "although these continuous winds are unrestricted in time by construction , antonuccio - delogu & silk ( 2008 ) demonstrated that agn feedback is able to suppress star formation in circumnuclear clouds during timescales much longer than that of the agn cycle itself .",
    "moreover , our super - wind scheme is likely as much effective as quasar - driven outflows in propagating metals at galactic scale , even though not yet sufficient to quench innermost star formation by direct energy injection .",
    "then , the need for agn feedback in reproducing the zm relation would be less compelling than that demanded by the cm relation , where the lack of a proper agn modelling hinders correct age and sfr ( hence colour ) estimations at the centre of massive galaxies ( see r08 ) .    the combined effect of outflows of processed gas and internal heating would act thus as to shape the later stages of the ds building by shutting down star formation in more massive cluster galaxies , at the same time halting the metallicity uplift .",
    "this evolution procedes starting from the inner galaxies following through the outer ones , with the latters not attaining yet the abundance peak till present time ; instead , massive galaxies in groups and cluster cores progressively saturate up to their maximum metal content , at around @xmath280.5 - 0.2 , while at the same time keep flattening their zm relation ( fig.[slods]@xmath39 ) .",
    "conversely , in the low - mass regime , that begins to dominate the slope in groups and cluster cores since @xmath751 , the major feedback mechanisms acting on the zm must rather be attributed to sne , whose rate depends only and directly on the sfr at any epoch ( see scannapieco et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "for what concerns the sf galaxies , they start migrating towards the ds as soon as a change in their sfe takes place , whether induced by shock - like events or by intrinsic nature ; there they will grow their metals following the rate of the ds systems , i.e. by simple ageing and mass loss of the stellar populations . at low @xmath0 , the highest ssfr is concentrated at low masses ( fig.[ssfr ] ) , where galactic winds shall be proportionally strong enough to make metals evaporate without quenching the sf , until they also reach the point of sf shut off ; after that , as it occurs in cluster cores , they quickly increase their metal content , since there are no more mechanisms efficient in sweeping metals out to the environment ( see fig .",
    "[ slosf]@xmath55 , third panel ) .",
    "a scenario of enhanced star formation history at @xmath641 in the low - to - intermediate mass bin is consistent with the epoch of last major mergers of our two clusters ( between @xmath60.8 and 1.5 ) , followed thence by a steady increase of the mean metallicity in both core and outskirt cluster galaxies : such increase evidently lasts even after the galaxy has entered the ds , until reaching a maximum at @xmath60.5 .    in conclusion , we find that the overall ( i.e. all - mass ) sf galaxy population shows stronger evolution in both slope and scatter of the zm relation than ds galaxies , within the redshift range considered .",
    "in particular , the main sf sequence ( as emerging from fig.[sfr ] ) evolves in both slope and scatter as mainly driven by ssfr , that is sfe .",
    "however , there are epochs like the post - merging phase undergone by our simulated clusters , when it is the combined effect of feedback and galaxy mergers that shapes its slope evolution by differentially affecting either mass regimes .    a possible emerging picture",
    "can then be proposed , where wet galaxy mergers boost up total metallicity in more massive sf galaxies at @xmath21 , while sn outflows deplete the less massive ones : both phenomena concur in raising the zm relation slope at higher redshift ; at same epoch , dry mergers and/or metal - poor gas inflows regulate the metal balance in less active galaxies , resulting into a shallower zm slope .",
    "conversely at @xmath641 , massive ds galaxies quench their residual star formation by internal shock heating , while low - mass ones keep ageing passively : both stabilize at a slowed down rate of metal enrichment ; sf galaxies instead have still gas available to feed star formation , as likely result of metal - rich mergers mainly involving low - mass systems : this can explain the accelerated metal increase as well as the relative flattening of their zm slope , along with the positive correlation between metallicity and sfr .",
    "we expect to further corroborate such interpretation by applying different feedback recipes in our simulations , as to better evaluate their effect on the sfe .",

    "<S> we present results from sph - cosmological simulations , including self - consistent modelling of sn feedback and chemical evolution , of galaxies belonging to two clusters and twelve groups . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the mass  metallicity ( zm ) relation of galaxies classified in two samples according to their star - forming activity , as parametrized by their ssfr , across a redshift range up to @xmath0=2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall zm relation for the composite population evolves according to a redshift - dependent quadratic functional form that is consistent with other empirical estimates , provided that the highest mass bin of the bcgs is excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> its slope shows irrelevant evolution in the passive sample , being steeper in groups than in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sub - sample of high - mass passive galaxies only is characterized by a steep increase of the slope with redshift , from which it can be inferred that the bulk of the slope evolution of the zm relation is driven by the more massive passive objects . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter of the passive sample is dominated by low - mass galaxies at all redshifts and keeps constant over cosmic times . the mean metallicity is highest in cluster cores and lowest in normal groups , following the same environmental sequence as that previously found in the red sequence building .    </S>",
    "<S> the zm relation for the star - forming sample reveals an increasing scatter with redshift , indicating that it is still being built at early epochs . </S>",
    "<S> the star - forming galaxies make up a tight sequence in the sfr-@xmath1 plane at high redshift , whose scatter increases with time alongside with the consolidation of the passive sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the anti - correlation between ssfr and stellar mass , pointing at a key role of the former in determining the galaxy downsizing , as the most significant means of diagnostics of the star formation efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , an anti - correlation between ssfr and metallicity can be established for the star - forming galaxies , while on the contrary more active galaxies in terms of simple sfr are also metal - richer .    </S>",
    "<S> finally the [ o / fe ] abundance ratio is presented too : we report a strong increasing evolution with redshift at given mass , especially at @xmath21 . the expected increasing trend with mass </S>",
    "<S> is recovered when only considering the more massive galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these results in terms of the mechanisms driving the evolution within the high- and low - mass regimes at different epochs : mergers , feedback - driven outflows and the intrinsic variation of the star formation efficiency . </S>"
