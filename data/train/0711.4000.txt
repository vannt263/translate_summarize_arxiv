    "the picture that emerged is one of an extremely complex free - energy landscape with many minima , the lowest of which are the equilibrium ` pure states ' .",
    "the geometrical organisation of these states , and their relative weights in the equilibrium measure are the main objects in the parisi theory  @xcite , at the centre of which is the functional order parameter @xmath0 giving the probability that two equilibrium configurations in a randomly chosen sample have an overlap @xmath1 .    a much more difficult programme , not quite completed yet , concerns the understanding of the organisation of the landscape away from the equilibrium configurations .",
    "questions such as the metastable state stability , their basins of attraction , and the nature of the    barriers separating them , have proven to be much harder to answer in an unambiguous way .",
    "this more detailed knowledge of the landscape may seem a necessary condition for the understanding of the experimental , non - equilibrium situation .",
    "surprisingly enough , it turns out that a direct solution of the out of equilibrium dynamics is in fact quite simpler .",
    "the dynamic approach was pioneered by sompolinsky and zippelius in the early 80 s , as a method to avoid the use of replicas for the calculation of equilibrium quantities @xcite .",
    "they introduced the general framework and succeeded in calculating the high - temperature quantities .",
    "the low - temperature situation turned out to be more complicated , and the problem of finding a true dynamic equilibrium solution remains open to this day .",
    "an alternative approach , developed in the early 90 s , is to study the out of equilibrium dynamics starting from a quench in temperature , just as in the experimental protocols  @xcite .",
    "although one might have expected that such a situation is hopelessly difficult , as it involves the landscape far from equilibrium , including the basins of attraction and barriers associated with metastable states , it turns out that the actual analytic solution is only slightly  if at all ",
    "harder than the equilibrium one using replicas .    in general",
    ", the gibbs - boltzmann measure can be explored with a stochastic process that satisfies detailed balance . in order for the system to equilibrate , the limit of large times taken _ before _ the thermodynamic limit :",

    "the order of limits ( [ lim0 ] ) guarantees ergodicity since barriers can be overcome at sufficiently long times for finite @xmath3 .",
    "the equilibrium thermodynamical values of any operator @xmath4 are then obtained as the long - time limit of noise averaged time - dependent observables , @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of divergent barriers in spin - glass mean - field models led sompolinsky  @xcite to postulate that these systems relax in a set of hierarchically ordered time scales that eventually diverge with @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath3-dependent timescales entered the solution proposed for the saddle - point equations of motion via the time - decay of the correlation and response functions . in this _ ansatz _ , although equilibrium was assumed , the the fluctuation - dissipation relation between correlation and response was violated . as several authors pointed out , this is clearly inconsistent  @xcite : the problem can be traced back to the fact that the saddle point dynamic equations are only valid when @xmath6 and the times are kept finite . in any event , both the existence of many timescales and the important role of the fluctuation - dissipation relations were found to be crucial features of the problem that reappeared in later developments .    a different situation , closer to the experimental procedure , is to consider the relaxation of infinite systems at long but finite times using initial conditions that are not correlated with the quenched disorder  @xcite .",
    "the order of limits is then @xmath7 divergent barriers in the thermodynamic limit imply ergodicity - breaking : the relaxational dynamics does not explore the full phase - space in finite times at large @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , there is no equilibration time @xmath8 such that for all subsequent times the system reaches either the gibbs - boltzmann distribution or any time - independent distribution in a fixed , restricted sector of phase space .",
    "the dynamics is for all times something different from local equilibrium .",
    "this is the phenomenon of _ aging _ : the relaxation of the system depends on its history at all times .",
    "though aging effects lie beyond the scope of thermodynamics , they have been observed in numerous disordered systems .",
    "as we shall see below , the dynamics of mean - field disordered models ( [ lim1 ] ) capture aging phenomena with similarities and differences from what is observed experimentally .    in what follows we summarise what is known about the out of equilibrium dynamics of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model  @xcite .",

    "although the natural dynamics for ising spin systems are of glauber  @xcite or montecarlo type , these are not well adapted to implement analytical calculations .",
    "it is then preferable to transform the discrete variables into continuous ones and to use langevin dynamics  @xcite .",

    "forces that oscillate in time can be used to mimic the slow relaxation under shaking of systems such as granular matter .",
    "such forces maintain the system in a driven out of equilibrium regime even if the limit ( [ lim0 ] ) is considered .",
    "the mean over the thermal noise is hereafter represented by @xmath29 .",
    "the dynamics of a langevin process is usually expressed with a functional integral for the generating functional by using the so - called martin - siggia - rose method . as de dominicis first pointed out",
    ", one does not need to use the replica trick to analyse the relaxation of models with quenched disorder if the initial condition is not correlated with the quenched randomness  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the relaxational dynamics of a disordered model is thus considerably more straightforward than that of the statics , in particular since all observables have a very clear physical interpretation and can be easily and directly accessed with experiments and numerical simulations .",

    "exact dynamic equations for the evolution of these dynamic macroscopic order parameters , in the _ strict _ large @xmath3 limit taken at the outset of the calculation , have been written down by sompolinsky and zippelius  @xcite .",
    "they are rather cumbersome because , just as in the static case , the spin variables can not be explicitly integrated away .",
    "several paths can be followed to approximate the effect of the quartic term introduced by the soft - spin potential .",
    "one possibility is to use a mode - coupling approximation  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to focus on the dynamics close to the critical temperature , use the fact that the transition is expected to be second order , and deal with the dynamic counterpart of the ` truncated model ' introduced by parisi for the equilibrium case .",
    "all parameters in the resulting large-@xmath3 equations are independent of @xmath3 and finite , and have a unique solution . in the high temperature , @xmath32 , regime the evolution reaches equilibrium , while below @xmath33",
    "this is no longer the case . in the following we focus on the relaxation in the low - temperature phase",
    "in this section we summarise the analytic solution to the sk model  @xcite .",
    "the following properties appear to be quite generic of glassy dynamics .",
    "_ separation of time - scales .",
    "_    after a ( long ) time @xmath34 there is a quick relaxation in a ` short ' time - delay @xmath35 and the self correlation decays to a value @xmath36 , followed by a slower drift away .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is interpreted as the edwards - anderson parameter that represents the size of a ` trap ' or the ` width of a channel ' in phase space . within these traps the system is fully ergodic while it becomes more and more difficult to escape a trap as time passes .",
    "the correlation and response functions can thus be written in a way that explicitly separates the terms corresponding to the relaxation within a trap : @xmath37 consistently , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are assumed to satisfy the equilibrium relations , _",
    "i.e. _ time homogeneity and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xmath40 and @xmath41    _ weak ergodicity - breaking . _",
    "the correlation satisfies : @xmath42 this means that the system , after a given time @xmath34 , starts drifting away ( albeit slowly ) until it reaches the maximal distance ( in general much larger than the size of a state ) at sufficiently long times @xmath43 .",
    "_ weak long - term memory .",
    "the integrated linear response satisfies : @xmath44 @xmath45 is the normalised ( linear ) response at time @xmath43 to a constant small magnetic field applied from @xmath46 up to @xmath47 , often called the ` thermoremanent magnetisation ' .",
    "this hypothesis is crucial , since the response function represents the memory the system has of what happened at previous times : the weakness of the long - term memory implies that the system responds to its past in an averaged way , the details of what takes place during a finite time tend to be washed away ( the ` high - school ' effect ) . in interesting cases ,",
    "the system however does not have only short - term memory : @xmath48 so that fields acting during an appreciable fraction of the distant past have a finite effect .",
    "the sompolinsky - zippelius  @xcite results for the equilibrium dynamics within a pure state can be reinterpreted in the out of equilibrium context to describe the first quick relaxation regime .",
    "one finds that the self - correlation decays to the plateau at the edwards - anderson parameter given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 with @xmath52 a nontrivial temperature - dependent exponent .",
    "the dynamic equations in the aging regime can be solved by using the properties listed above .",
    "the slowness of the dynamics allows one to neglect the effect of the time - derivative and write down coupled integral equations for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these equations are invariant under reparametrisations of time , @xmath55 , that transform the ` fields ' @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath56    this invariance deserves some explanation",
    ". the complete equations of motion have no such symmetry .",
    "however , in the large - time limit , the equations for the ` aging ' correlation and responses @xmath57 become less and less dependent of the timescale , because time - derivative terms become less and less relevant . only in the infinite time limit are time - derivatives negligible and reparametrisations become a true symmetry .",
    "( broken ) symmetries are related to divergent susceptibilities and large spontaneous fluctuations . here",
    ", these susceptibilities and fluctuations will diverge only in the large - time ( or vanishing frequency ) limit .",
    "let us see this with a concrete example  @xcite .",
    "if we add to the equations of motion ( [ lang ] ) a forcing term of the form ( [ antisim ] ) , one can show that aging disappears _ whatever the value of @xmath58 _ , and correlations become stationary at large times : @xmath59 the time for such a stationary regime to be achieved grows with @xmath58 .",
    "hence , we have that the system has an arbitrarily large susceptibility with respect to the forces @xmath60 ( because the two - point correlation functions depend strongly on them ) , provided we wait long enough .",
    "one can also reason in terms of spontaneous fluctuations , as we shall see below , a path that suggests the introduction of a ` sigma model ' that encapsulates the fluctuations in the ` almost - flat ' directions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the aging regime in the sk model motivated the study of generic properties of time correlation functions and the development of a complete classification of their possible behaviour  @xcite .",
    "take three ordered times @xmath61 , and the corresponding correlations are @xmath62 the monotonicity of the decay of the correlations with respect to the longer time ( keeping the shorter time fixed ) and the shorter time ( keeping the longer time fixed ) allows us to derive general properties that strongly constrain the possible scaling forms .",
    "indeed , one can relate any three correlation functions via _ triangle relations _",
    "@xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a function that determines the form of the triangles whose vertexes are configurations at three large times .",
    "the fact that the limit exists is a reasonable working assumption .",
    "( note that we defined @xmath65 using the correlation between the longest and the intermediate as the first argument . )",
    "the function @xmath65 is time - reparametrisation invariant , associative @xmath66 , it has an identity and a zero , and it is bounded . exploiting these properties we showed that the most general @xmath65 is composed of pieces satisfying either of the two forms : @xmath67 this allows to classify every possible",
    "_ ansatz_. note that for @xmath68 equal to the identity the first type of function becomes simply @xmath69 , hence the name .",
    "it is also possible to prove that the first kind of function ( [ isoproduct ] ) is only compatible with the time scaling @xmath70 with @xmath71 a monotonically growing function .",
    "the dynamics of a given model can occur in two or more correlation scales .",
    "in particular , for the sk model    * @xmath65 is isomorphic to the product for correlation values in the stationary regime , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "* @xmath65 is ultrametric for correlation values in the aging regime , @xmath74 .    even though dynamic ultrametricity seems mysterious at first sight",
    "there is a simple graphical construction that allows one to test it .",
    "take two times @xmath75 such that @xmath76 equals some prescribed value , say @xmath77 .",
    "plot now @xmath78 against @xmath79 using @xmath80 , @xmath81 , as a parameter .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath83 we find two possible plots .",
    "if @xmath84 , for long enough @xmath85 , the function @xmath65 becomes isomorphic to the product .",
    "plotting then @xmath78 for longer and longer @xmath85 , the construction approaches a limit in which @xmath86 .",
    "if , instead , @xmath87 , in the long @xmath85 limit the construction approaches a different curve .    a preasymptotic scaling that leads to ultrametricity in the limit of diverging times has been found by bertin and bouchaud in their study of the dynamics of the critical trap model  @xcite . indeed , it is simple to check that for any three correlations scaling as @xmath88 relation ( [ ultrametricity ] ) is recovered asymptotically .",
    "ultrametricity in time is also very clear for a driven system satisfying ( [ ludovic ] ) . in the limit of small",
    "@xmath58 one can check that @xmath89 $ ] there is some evidence for it in the @xmath90 edwards - anderson ( ea ) model . in @xmath91 instead",
    "the numerical data does not support this scaling  @xcite . whether this is due to the short times",
    "involved or if the asymptotic scaling is different in @xmath91 is still an open question that will probably never be answered numerically or experimentally , as it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that time ultrametricity would take astronomic times to show up even if present asymptotically .",
    "the analytic solution is such that , in the asymptotic limit in which the waiting - time @xmath92 diverges after @xmath93 , the integrated linear response approaches the limit @xmath94 when @xmath92 and @xmath43 diverge while keeping the correlation between them fixed to @xmath95  @xcite . deriving this relation with respect to the waiting time @xmath92 ,",
    "one finds that the opposite of the inverse of the slope of the curve @xmath96 is a parameter that replaces temperature in the differential form of the fdt .",
    "thus , using eq .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) one defines @xmath97 ( @xmath24 ) , that can be a function of the correlation .",
    "under certain circumstances one can show that this quantity has the properties of a temperature  @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this formulation is that , just as in the construction of triangle relations , times have been `` divided away '' and the relation ( [ fdt ] ) is invariant under the reparametrisations of time ( [ eq : rpg ] ) .",
    "moreover , the functional form taken by @xmath96 allows one to classify glassy systems into sort of ` universality classes ' .",
    "equation  ( [ fdt ] ) is easy to understand graphically .",
    "let us take a waiting time @xmath92 , say equal to @xmath98 time units after the preparation of the system ( by this we mean that the temperature of the environment has been set to @xmath99 at the initial time ) and trace @xmath100 against @xmath101 using @xmath43 as a parameter ( @xmath43 varies between @xmath92 and infinity ) .",
    "if we choose to work with a correlation that is normalised to one at equal times , the parametric curve starts at the point @xmath102 ) and ends in the point @xmath103 ) .",
    "now , let us choose a longer waiting time , say @xmath104 time units , and reproduce this construction . equation  ( [ fdt ] ) states that if one repeats this construction for a sufficiently long waiting time , the parametric curve approaches a limit @xmath96 .",
    "in the sk model one finds @xmath105 this result corresponds to having a succession of temporal scales each one with an effective temperature , @xmath106 .",
    "the question as to whether this behaviour strictly applies to the finite dimensional case remains open .",
    "fluctuation - dissipation violations , _",
    "i.e. _ the existence of @xmath107 in the infinite waiting - time limit do exist , for instance in systems with growing domains , but we still have no examples in which we are certain that @xmath108 stays bounded away both from @xmath99 and from infinity t , in the large waiting - time limit ( the latter being the case for coarsening models ) .",
    "numerical simulations in finite dimensional spin - glass and structural glass models show a clear deviation from fdt during the out of equilibrium relaxation but these are obtained for finite times and although these times are relatively long it is hard to extract the truly asymptotic limit .      in  @xcite a set of generalised susceptibilities @xmath109_{h=0 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & r \\int_0^t dt ' \\ ,",

    "the physical meaning of @xmath110 is clear . if the order of large system size and long time limits are reversed the generating functional becomes parisi static functional order parameter .",
    "the analytic solution of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the sk model is such that @xmath112  even if the physical situations that these two order parameters describe are very different  @xcite .",
    "all generalised susceptibilities converge , then , to the equilibrium values  @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the landscape the sk dynamics visits at different long times is similar to the one that characterises the equilibrium pure states ( though with finite barriers separating the traps visited dynamically ) .",
    "although at long but finite times with respect to @xmath3 the sk model explores regions of phase space that it will eventually leave never to return , some geometrical properties of these regions coincide with those of the equilibrium states .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in a slightly different context in ref .",
    "the quantities studies there were the staggered auto - correlation and linear response : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the eigenvalues of the @xmath115 random matrix @xmath10 associated with the eigenvectors @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 is the time - dependent @xmath3-dimensional vector of spins , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 are the staggered spin states .",
    "we showed that the staggered auto - correlation distribution @xmath120 , between two large and widely separated times @xmath85 and @xmath80 chosen such that @xmath121 coincides with the static one computed with configurations belonging to two equilibrium states with mutual overlap @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , if one stores the configuration at times @xmath80 and let the system evolve up to a time @xmath123 such that again @xmath124 one obtains the same form for the staggered correlation @xmath125 .",

    "the one - time quantities ( e.g. nonlinear susceptibilities and staggered magnetisation ) derived from the dynamics of the sk model thus coincide with those calculated in equilibrium .",
    "this fact , though rather surprising for a mean - field model , has been derived under certain assumptions for finite - dimensional models @xcite .    at the mean - field level",
    ", this coincidence holds for models that do not have a ` threshold ' level below which the system can not penetrate in finite times with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "examples are _ e.g. _ the sk model and the model of a manifold in a random potential with long - range correlations  @xcite , both having a continuous set of correlation scales and being solved by a full replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) scheme at the static level . instead , there is no reason why the free - energy landscape explored dynamically should resemble the static one in models with a threshold , such as the @xmath128-spin spherical model  @xcite ( that is characterised , statically by a one - step level of rsb ) .",
    "let us remark that the good agreement between the numerical calculation of @xmath129 for large @xmath43 and the static distribution @xmath130 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stag ] , constitutes a rather detailed test of the solution of the out of equilibrium dynamics for this model .",
    "further studies of the organisation of metastable state and their relevance to the out of equilibrium relaxation of the sk model appeared in  @xcite .",
    "a means to study the dynamics in the glassy phase in more detail consists in following the evolution of the sample under a complicated temperature history .",

    "experiments in _ dipole _ glasses display an `` intermediate '' behaviour in the sense that a temperature cycling provokes strong asymmetric results , as in spin - glasses , while they also present very strong dependencies on the cooling rate , a property that is not observed in spin - glasses though is very common in structural glasses  @xcite .",
    "mean - field inspired researchers have interpreted the experimental results of temperature cycling experiments using a hierarchical dynamic picture inspired by the organisation of equilibrium states in the parisi solution of the sk model . in this picture",
    "one assumes that spin - glasses have a large number of metastable states that are organised in a hierarchical fashion just like the equilibrium states .",
    "it is then proposed that the system is composed of ( independent ) subsystems whose dynamics is given by the wandering in such a landscape  @xcite .",

    "the outcome of temperature cycling experiments in spin - glasses can be understood within the dynamic solution of the sk model .",
    "moreover , the reasons why these effects should be hardly observable in spin - glasses at very short times such as are inevitably involved in simulations , and they are absent in structural glasses are clear within the analytic solution to the dynamics of mean - field models  @xcite .    the key dynamic property to explain the outcome of these experiments is the sharp separation of correlation - scales in the asymptotic waiting - time limit .",
    "take a fixed ( but very long ) waiting time and let the system evolve further .",
    "imagine at the subsequent time @xmath43 the self - correlation is @xmath131 .",
    "the decay below this value needs a time - delay that is infinitely longer than @xmath132 . in other words , at any times @xmath43 and @xmath92 the correlation ( and linear response ) can be separated in two terms , a fast and a slow one , such that for all time delays such that @xmath133 changes @xmath134 is fixed while , instead , if @xmath134 varies @xmath133 has reached its limiting value .",
    "the effect of a temperature jump is then very different on the fast and the slow scales .",
    "the easiest way to visualise it is to use fig .  [ sketch ]  ( a ) . upon changing the external temperature the fd plot is modified by changing the slope of the linear part representing the equilibrium fdt result and , in consequence , the intercept of the line with the curve part that remains unchanged under the parisi - toulouse ( pat ) hypothesis  @xcite that consists in two assertions :    * @xmath96 is independent of @xmath99 and @xmath135 in the aging regime ; * @xmath36 only depends on @xmath99 and @xmath136 only depends on @xmath135 .",
    "the near temperature - independence of @xmath96 in the aging regime of the sk model has been argued at the level of parisi static solution and carries through to the non - equilibrium relaxation due to @xmath112 .",

    "the slow scales are just modified by a time - parametrisation ( [ eq : rpg ] ) , independently of the jump being positive or negative .",
    "the scales between @xmath136 and @xmath36 are instead created or destroyed ( restarted or erased ) by the negative and positive temperature jumps .",

    "the aging dynamics of these systems occurs in only one time - scale , typically described by a simple @xmath139 scaling . in these cases",
    "the argument described above does not apply ( the decay of the correlation below any value @xmath74 is not infinitely slower than the one that occurred before ) .",

    "the disorder - averaged , noise - induced dynamic fluctuations of finite dimensional glassy systems was proposed in @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are not induced by the particular realisation of quenched disorder but should be generated dynamically in models in which time - parametrisation invariance develops asymptotically .",

    "_    if one wishes to show that a given system with a broken symmetry tends to behave like a sigma model in some limit , what one has to do is to plot the fluctuations of the ` radial ' variables that are left invariant by the group , and check that they become vanishingly small compared to those of the ` angular ' variables generated by the group itself . in precisely that spirit , in order to show that the system s fluctuations explore preferentially the ( almost ) flat directions generated by reparametrisation invariance , one can plot the fluctuations of correlations and responses in such a way as to show that fluctuations of quantities left invariant by this group ( the departures from a @xmath140 vs @xmath95 curve ) become negligible with respect to fluctuations generated by reparametrisations ( along the @xmath140 vs @xmath95 curve ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sk - finite - size ] shows the level curves of the joint probability of the global susceptibility and correlation of an sk model for a system with @xmath141 at @xmath142 .",
    "the distribution functions were obtained using @xmath143 pairs @xmath144 with @xmath145 different noise histories , and repeating this procedure with @xmath98 different realisations of disorder .",
    "the straight line represents the equilibrium fdt .",
    "we see that the probability distribution is peaked on the global @xmath146 curve .",
    "thus , we conclude that different histories tend to be affected by random time reparametrisations , just as a sigma model tends to fluctuate along the angles spanned by the group .",
    "very similar results have been obtained in the @xmath91 ea model  @xcite .",
    "_ fluctuations in the noise - averaged local quantities _",
    "the existence of soft modes for time - parametrisation is a feature of slow dynamics , quite independent of the presence of quenched disorder . in order to stress this point , fig .",
    "[ fig : sk - noise - averaged ] shows the distribution over sample realisations of correlations and response function fig .",
    "[ fig : sk - finite - size ] , the data for each sample being averaged over the noise .",
    "the orientation of the contour levels does not follow the @xmath147 curve but , instead , it is approximately parallel to the fdt straight line . clearly , the sample - to - sample variations have nothing to do with the reparametrisation invariance , which is a dynamic effect . again , very similar results are obtained in the @xmath91 ea model .",
    "the sk model is , undoubtedly , the mean - field model of spin - glasses .",
    "one would then like to confront its dynamic behaviour to the one observed experimentally . in this section briefly do this by discussing some salient experimental results .",
    "several groups studied the relaxation of spin - glasses using ac - susceptibility and dc magnetisation measurements .",
    "the experimental data  as well as the numerical data from simulations of the @xmath91 ea model  are rather well described by a much simpler time - dependence than the one found in the sk model .",
    "more precisely , neither the ultrametric relation ( [ ultrametricity ] ) nor its pre - asymptotic form ( [ eq : pre - ultra ] ) fit the data satisfactorily",
    ". instead , the data are rather accurately described by a two - scale scenario with an aging regime characterised by an enhanced power law , @xmath148 , with @xmath149 , that weakly deviates from a simple power  @xcite .",
    "note that this scaling is also different from the one predicted by the droplet model  @xcite .",
    "temperature cycling experiments are amongst the most striking and beautiful ones made with spin - glasses .",
    "as mentioned above , the sk model responds to temperature cycling in a manner qualitatively very close to that of experiments .",
    "what remains a mystery however , is that the memory effects in the sk model arise thanks to the existence of many widely - separated timescales , while in the experimental system there seems to be only a single scale .      _ direct measurements _",
    "deviations from the fdt should be tested by measuring the dynamic induced and spontaneous fluctuations of a chosen observable using the same experimental device . in a remarkable series of experiments , hrisson and ocio carried out such a study focusing on the magnetisation of an isolating spin - glass sample  @xcite .",
    "their results for correlation and linear response functions are compatible with the two - scale scenario and the enhanced power law aging time - scale .",
    "the direct comparison between integrated linear response and correlation function yields an fd plot that has been interpreted by the authors as being similar to the curved shape of the sk model .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that this interpretation is inconsistent with the understanding of the fluctuation - dissipation deviations as being related to the existence of effective temperatures  @xcite , since the whole decay occurs in a single timescale .",
    "moreover , in our opinion , the resulting fd plot can not be really distinguished from a broken straight line which is consistent with a two - scale scenario and the effective temperature interpretation .",
    "the same _ proviso _ applies to the numerical data for the @xmath91 ea model .",
    "_ zero - field and field - cooled magnetisation _",
    "an indirect study of the fluctuation - dissipation relation using several sets of experimental data obtained from various samples was presented in  @xcite .",
    "the proposal , motivated by discussions with ds sherrington during a visit to the university of oxford , is to use the well - known difference between the field - cooled and zero - field cooled magnetisation in the low @xmath99 phase to infer the deviation from the fluctuation - dissipation relation between spontaneous and induced fluctuations .",
    "the approach uses a dynamic extension of the parisi - toulouse ( pat ) approximation  @xcite that we explained above .",
    "the pat approximation allows us to estimate the @xmath95-dependence of the susceptibility using _ exclusively _ response results , thus circumventing the difficulties inherent to noise measurements .",
    "deviations from the curie - weiss law due to a non - vanishing average of the exchange coupling in real spin - glasses were also taken into account .",
    "the strategy is to use data taken under @xmath99 and @xmath135 conditions such that the system is at the limit of validity of fdt , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath150 .",
    "the point @xmath151 is the intersection between the straight part ( fdt regime ) and the aging part of @xmath96 where @xmath152 and to associate @xmath153 to the zero - field cooled susceptibility @xmath154 measured experimentally .",
    "@xmath155 is the equal time correlation that is not necessarily one but can be obtained from @xmath156 .",
    "the locus of the points obtained by varying @xmath99 spans a _ master curve _ @xmath157",
    "which , by the pat hypothesis , is field and temperature independent . at a given working temperature @xmath99 the actual @xmath96 curve consists of a straight line with slope @xmath158 joining @xmath159 and @xmath160 and a second part given by @xmath157 .",
    "the method of construction is explained in @xcite and it is illustrated in fig  [ sketch ] .",
    "a complementary argument uses the field - cooled magnetisation to construct @xmath157 by spanning @xmath161 as a function of @xmath135 .",
    "the analysis is most reliable for cumn , a system in which the curie - weiss law as well as the pat approximation are very well verified .",
    "figure  [ sketch ] shows the @xmath157 curve determined using the zfc data of nagata _ et al _ for two concentrations  @xcite .",
    "there are no experimental points for @xmath162 that correspond to rather low temperatures .",
    "we know however that @xmath96 tends to zero as @xmath163 since @xmath164 .",
    "in addition , the slope @xmath165 should be infinite at @xmath166 so that @xmath167 only at @xmath168",
    ". the validity of the hypotheses can be judged by the inset where we show the temperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility for the 1.08% compound .",
    "a curie - weiss law with @xmath169 holds accurately for all @xmath170 .",
    "the @xmath99-independence of @xmath171 required by the pat approximation is also well verified below the transition .",
    "the same is true for the 2.02% sample . for comparison",
    ", we also show the curve @xmath96 for the @xmath91 ea model , at @xmath172 and @xmath173 , obtained numerically in ref .",
    "the agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data for the 1.08% sample is remarkable",
    ". it may be fortuitous , however , since the results for the 2.02% sample deviate from it .",
    "in fact , one must note that @xmath96 is not a universal function .",
    "for example , it depends on the details of the hamiltonian ( heisenberg , ising and , in general , the level of anisotropy ) even at the mean - field level .",
    "thus , there is no reason to expect universality in real systems .",
    "note that in real samples a spin - glass transition in a field may not exist .",
    "however , even if this were the case , the system should remain below a slowly time - dependent _ pseudo _ de almeida - thouless ( at ) line for still relatively long times : it ages and behaves as a true ( out of equilibrium ) glass with a non - trivial @xmath96 that would eventually become a straight line with slope @xmath158 .",
    "another important issue is the asymptotic ( @xmath174 ) form of the @xmath175 curve .",
    "even if the system never equilibrates , the @xmath175 curve may still be a very slowly varying function of @xmath92 , eventually reaching a form different from that observed experimentally .",
    "one is not in a position to discard this possibility .",
    "as was mentioned above , equilibrium and large - time non - equilibrium one - time quantities are expected ( under certain assumptions ) to coincide  @xcite . if these hypotheses are warranted for spin glasses , the slope of the dynamic @xmath96 , for an infinite system in the large-@xmath92 limit should coincide with the static @xmath176 as defined by the probability of overlaps of configurations taken with the gibbs measure  the connection being established through the generalised susceptibilities as explained above .",
    "the determination of a non - trivial @xmath96 would thus imply a non - trivial @xmath176 and would hence validate parisi s solution .",
    "the problem , as is usual in these systems , lies in the fact that the dynamics , even in the experimental case , are confined to quite short times .",
    "from the dynamic point of view , the sherrington - kirkpatrick model has some aspects in which it resembles experimental systems , and some in which it does not . amongst the resemblances , as we have seen , one can count the fluctuation - dissipation characteristics and the remarkable temperature - cycling properties of memory loss and recovery .    on the other hand",
    ", there is the inescapable fact that one does not see any evidence of dynamic ultrametricty either in experimental systems or in their numeric counterparts , while these are easily observable in simulations of the sk model  @xcite . even assuming that at longer times the separation of timescales would develop , this can be estimated to happen not before astronomic times  @xcite .    as mentioned in the previous section , a non - trivial @xmath96 at very long times",
    "is an indication of a nontrivial parisi function .",
    "the problem is that experimentally accessible times are not that long  coherence length scales of around twenty are estimated in the best of cases .",
    "an apparently nontrivial @xmath96 that would eventually become trivial  or an apparent almeida - thouless line disappearing at long times  would be an example of a phenomenon that is a permanent source of confusion : finite size systems in equilibrium , and infinite - size systems at short times , tend to have a pre - asymptotic behaviour that looks qualitatively mean - field like .",
    "this tendency can be judged as positive  because the mean - field picture is then a qualitative model of what we see in practice , or negative  because it does not allow us to distinguish properly between theories .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick model was originally designed as a toy model of spin glass , that would serve as a straightforward , practical starting point .",
    "fortunately for us , this expectation proved unfounded , as over thirty years of surprises and amusement have shown .",
