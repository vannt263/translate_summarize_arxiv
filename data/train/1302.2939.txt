    "<S> fermion zero modes for abelian bps monopoles are considered . in the spherically symmetric case </S>",

    "<S> keywords : abelian gauge theory , bps monopoles , weyl equation , fermion zero modes .    </S>",
    "<S> fermion zero modes for bps monopoles can be constructed via the same nahm transform used to obtain the monopoles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the construction is , however , cumbersome for magnetic charge @xmath3 . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we obtain zero modes for abelian bps monopoles . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to directly integrate the weyl equations in three - dimensional space rather than use nahm s method ( which has been adapted to abelian monopoles in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the abelian bps equations read @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a real higgs field and @xmath6 is a magnetic field derived from a vector potential @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the maxwell equation @xmath8 implies that the higgs field @xmath5 obeys the laplace equation . the higgs field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 constant , is harmonic away from @xmath0 singularities @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the system comprises @xmath0 dirac monopoles each with magnetic charge @xmath11 interacting with a higgs field . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 fixes the asymptotic value of the higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> consider the weyl operators @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electric charge of the fermion and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> these weyl operators assume a real yukawa coupling in minkowski space . </S>",
    "<S> however , identifying @xmath5 as @xmath17 they are also weyl operators for self - dual monopoles defined in euclidean space .    </S>",
    "<S> the dirac quantisation condition requires @xmath18 with @xmath19 integer . if @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 has @xmath0 normalisable zero modes . in the @xmath23 case </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath24 taking the origin as the location of the monopole and @xmath25 denote spherical polar coordinates . here </S>",
    "<S> the dirac string lies on the positive @xmath26-axis .    </S>",
    "<S> one can verify that @xmath27 is a zero mode of @xmath22 ( the components of @xmath22 in spherical polar coordinates are given in the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 has no zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be obtained by taking the large @xmath29 limit of the jackiw - rebbi zero mode @xcite for the basic @xmath30 bps monopole after performing a gauge transformation which diagonalises the higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> the fermion density @xmath31 is spherically symmetric and has an integrable singularity at the monopole centre .    </S>",
    "<S> the general @xmath0 case is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the spherically symmetric case where the positions of the @xmath0 monopoles coincide the higgs field is @xmath32 and @xmath7 is the @xmath23 potential multiplied by @xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 has @xmath0 normalisable zero modes : @xmath33 these solutions resemble ( in particular with respect to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 dependence ) known solutions of the dirac equation in the background of abelian monopoles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our solutions are written directly in terms of trigonometric functions rather than spherical harmonics is even the zero modes can be expressed in terms of standard spherical harmonics . if @xmath0 is odd spin - weighted or monopole harmonics @xcite are required . ] . </S>",
    "<S> our solutions are normalisable with @xmath36 norm @xmath37 . as the zero modes @xmath38 are annihilated by the hamiltonian it is not clear to us whether the presence of the higgs field cures the self - adjointness problem associated with monopole hamiltonians . to address this issue one needs to study the scattering states @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the densities @xmath39 are not spherically symmetric for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath40 the first zero mode is zero along the positive @xmath26-axis while the second mode is zero on the negative @xmath26-axis . by taking a suitable linear combination of @xmath41 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 one can obtain a zero mode with a zero along any half - line emanating from the monopole ; the zero mode is axially symmetric about the axis on which the half - line lies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 zero modes are zero along @xmath2 half - lines . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath41 and @xmath43 have zeros of strength @xmath2 on the positive and negative @xmath26-axes , respectively ; the remaining @xmath44 modes have lower strength zeros on both the positive and negative @xmath26 axes . </S>",
    "<S> again one can adjust the directions of the @xmath2 half lines by taking different linear combinations of the @xmath0 zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> for a discussion of zeros of fermion zero modes in a different context see @xcite .    in general , the @xmath3 zero modes are not axially symmetric even though the @xmath38 are all axially symmetric about the @xmath26-axis . if @xmath45 is a linear combination of the @xmath38 , the density @xmath46 has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the zero modes vanish at the position of the monopole and the zero modes peak somewhere on the sphere @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath50 has up to @xmath2 zeros ; if there are fewer than @xmath2 zeros these are repeated zeros associated with coincident half - lines . </S>",
    "<S> examination of @xmath50 for several zero modes indicates that @xmath50 has a single peak . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the @xmath51 zero mode @xmath52 yields an @xmath50 function with two zeros and a maximum on the equator @xmath53 ( these three points are equally spaced on the equator ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath50 is a point on the unit sphere except for some axially symmetric solutions where @xmath50 peaks on a circle . in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> spherical plots of @xmath50 are given for an @xmath40 and an @xmath51 zero mode .     </S>",
    "<S> for an @xmath40 and @xmath51 zero mode ( the scale depends on the normalisation and hence @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the left plot shows @xmath50 for an @xmath40 zero mode ( @xmath54 ) which has one zero and is axially symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> two zeros are visible for the @xmath51 zero mode ( @xmath55 ) on the right . </S>",
    "<S> both zero modes have a single peak . ]    </S>",
    "<S> van baal @xcite has given an ansatz which provides a solution of the weyl equation for any solution of the abelian bps equation : @xmath56 satisfies @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 satisfies the laplace equation . </S>",
    "<S> this works as the bps equation implies @xmath60 is a scalar and ( [ vanbaal2 ] ) gives @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> taking    @xmath62 yields our @xmath5 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath63 is not normalisable ) does provide one normalisable zero mode for a different class of higgs fields ; here @xmath5 has @xmath64 singularities representing @xmath0 positively charged and @xmath0 negatively charged monopoles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] though for @xmath65 it agrees with our zero mode @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath41 is the @xmath65 van baal solution multiplied by @xmath66 . as the van baal construction does not rely on spherical symmetry </S>",
    "<S> this approach may provide information about the @xmath65 limit of the general case where the @xmath0 monopoles are separated .    </S>",
    "<S> we have considered fermion zero modes for bps monopoles and have obtained solutions for arbitrary magnetic charge @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the spherically symmetric abelian case we have solved may provide a model for non - abelian magnetic bags ; although higher charge @xmath30 bps monopoles are never spherically symmetric , solutions with approximate spherical symmetry may emerge for large @xmath0 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to investigate the extent to which our zero modes approximate the fermion zero modes of magnetic bags . </S>"
