    "the interest in these types of intermetallic alloys was revived after the prediction,@xcite using first - principles calculations , of half - metallicity in nimnsb , a semi - heusler compound .",
    "the high curie temperatures@xcite exhibited by the half - metallic heusler alloys are their main advantage with respect to other half - metallic systems ( e.g. some oxides like cro@xmath0 and fe@xmath6o@xmath7 and some manganites like la@xmath8sr@xmath9mno@xmath6).@xcite while for the other compounds the curie temperature is near the room temperature , for the half - metal nimnsb it is 730 k and for the half - metallic co@xmath0mnsi it reaches the 985 k.@xcite a second advantage of heusler alloys for realistic applications is their structural similarity to the zinc - blende structure , adopted by binary semiconductors widely used in industry ( such as gaas on zns ) .",

    "the dashed line represents the slater - pauling behavior . ]",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of the full - heusler compounds are similar to the half - heusler compounds@xcite with the additional complication of the presence of 2 co atoms per unit cell as in co@xmath0mnge . in the case of the semi - heusler alloys",
    "there are exactly nine occupied minority - spin electronic states ; one of s character and three of p - character provided by the sp atom and five bonding d - states originating from the hybridization between the transition metal atoms .",
    "in addition to these bands , in the case of full - heusler alloys there are five states exclusively located at the co sites and near the fermi level and the fermi level is located among these states so that three out of five are occupied and two of them unoccupied leading to small energy gaps.@xcite now there are 12 minority - spin occupied states and the compounds with 24 valence electrons like fe@xmath0vsb are semiconductors . if vanadium is substituted by a higher - valent atom , spontaneous spin polarization occurs , and the exchange splitting shifts the majority states to lower energies .",
    "the extra electrons fill in only majority states and the total spin moment per unit cell in @xmath10 , @xmath1 , which is the number of uncompensated spins is the total number of valence electrons , @xmath2 , minus two times the 12 , : @xmath1=@xmath2 - 24 .",
    "this behavior is the so - called slater - pauling behavior and e.g. half - metallic co@xmath0cral ( 27 valence electrons ) has a total spin moment of 3 @xmath10 and half - metallic co@xmath0mnsi ( 29 valence electrons ) a spin moment of 5 @xmath10 .",
    "this rule provides a direct connection between the half - metallicity and the total spin moment which can be easily determined experimentally . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we have plotted the calculated total spin moments for several full - heusler compounds as a function of the total number of valence electrons .",
    "the dashed line represents the slater - pauling rule of half - metallic full heusler alloys . since 7 majority bands ( 2@xmath11co @xmath12 , 5@xmath11mn @xmath13 )",
    "are unoccupied , the largest possible moment is 7 @xmath14 and would occur if all majority @xmath13-states were occupied .",
    "of course it would be impossible to get a compound with a total spin moment of 7 @xmath14 but even @xmath15 is difficult to obtain . as it was shown by wurmehl et al .",
    "@xcite , the on - site correlations in co@xmath0fesi play a critical role for this compound and calculations within the lda+u scheme , rather than the lda , give a spin moment of 6 @xmath14 .",
    "we should also note here that ferromagnetism is stabilized by the inter - sublattice interactions between the mn(cr ) and co atoms and between co atoms belonging to different sublattices as shown by first - principles calculations.@xcite    before closing this section we should discuss also the role of the @xmath16-elements in half - metallic heusler alloys . while the @xmath16-elements are not responsible for the appearance of the minority gap , they are very important for the physical properties of the heusler alloys and their structural stability .",
    "sp atoms provide one s and three p bands per spin which lay very low in energy and accommodate d - electrons of the transition metal atoms .",
    "thus the effective d - charge , which is accommodated by transition - metal atomic d - hybrids , is reduced stabilizing the half - metallicity .",
    "these s- and p - states of the sp atom strongly hybridize with the transition metal @xmath13-states and the charge in these bands is delocalized and locally the sp atoms even lose charge in favor of the transition metal atoms .",
    "in this section we discuss results on the defects in the case of co@xmath0mnz alloys where z is al and si.@xcite to simulate the doping by electrons we substitute fe for mn while to simulate the doping of the alloys with holes we substitute cr for mn and we have considered the cases of moderate doping substituting 5%  and 10%  of the mn atoms and we present our results in figure [ fig2 ] for the co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0mnal compounds . as discussed in the previous section the gap is created between states located exclusively at the co sites .",
    "the states low in energy ( around -6 ev below the fermi level ) originate from the low - lying p - states of the sp atoms and the ones at around -9 ev below the fermi level are the s - states of the sp - atom .",
    "the majority - spin occupied states form a common mn - co band while the occupied minority states are mainly located at the co sites and the minority unoccupied states at the mn sites .",
    "the extra electron in the the co@xmath0mnsi alloy occupies majority states leading to an increase of the exchange splitting between the occupied majority and the unoccupied minority states and thus to larger gap - width for the si - based compound . in the case of the al - based alloy",
    "the bonding and antibonding minority d - hybrids almost overlap and the gap is substituted by a region of very small minority density of states ( dos ) ; we will call it a pseudogap . in both cases",
    "the fermi level falls within the gap ( co@xmath0mnsi ) or the pseudogap ( co@xmath0mnal ) and an almost perfect spin - polarization at the fermi level is preserved .",

    "this is a clear sign of the chemical disorder ; fe and cr induce peaks at slightly different places than the mn atoms resulting to this smoothening and as the doping increases this phenomenon becomes more intense .",
    "the important detail is what happens around the fermi level and in what extent is the gap in the minority band affected by the doping .",
    "so now we will concentrate only at the enlarged regions around the fermi level .",
    "the dashed lines represent the cr - doping while the dotted lines are the fe - doped alloys .",
    "cr - doping in co@xmath0mnsi has only a marginal effect to the gap .",

    "its width is larger with respect to the perfect compound and becomes slightly narrower as the degree of doping increases .    in the case of fe - doping",
    "the situation is more complex . adding electrons to the system means that , in order to retain the perfect half - metallicity , these electrons should occupy high - energy lying antibonding majority states .",
    "this is energetically not very favorable in the case of co@xmath0mnsi and for these moderate degrees of doping a new shoulder appears in the unoccupied states which is close to the right - edge of the gap ; a sign of a large change in the competition between the exchange splitting of the mn majority and minority states and of the coulomb repulsion . in the case of the 20% fe doping in co@xmath0mnsi ( not shown here )",
    "this new peak crosses the fermi level and the fermi level is no more exactly in the gap but slightly above it .",
    "further substitution should lead to the complete destruction of the half - metallicity.@xcite recent ab - initio calculations including the on - site coulomb repulsion ( the so - called hubbard @xmath20 ) have predicted that co@xmath0fesi is in reality half - metallic reaching a total spin magnetic moment of 6 @xmath14 which is the largest known spin moment for a half - metal.@xcite fe - doping on the other hand in co@xmath0mnal almost does not change the dos around the fermi level .",
    "the extra - electrons occupy high - energy lying antibonding majority states but , since co@xmath0mnal has one valence electron less than co@xmath0mnsi , half - metallicity remains energetically favorable and no important changes occur upon fe - doping and further substitution of fe for mn should retain the half - metallicity even for the co@xmath0feal compound although lda - based ab - initio calculations predict that the limiting case of co@xmath0feal is almost half - metallic.@xcite",
    "in the previous section we have examined the case of defects in half - metallic ferromagnets . half - metallic ferrimagnetism ( hmfi ) on the other hand",

    "we will start our discussion from the dos .",
    "the perfect compounds show a gap in the minority - spin band and the fermi level falls within this gap and thus the compounds are half - metals . when the sp atom is si instead of al the gap is larger due to the extra electron which occupies majority states of the transition metal atoms@xcite and increases the exchange splitting between the majority occupied and the minority unoccupied states .",
    "this electron increases the cr spin moment by @xmath260.5 @xmath14 and the moment of each co atom by @xmath260.25 @xmath14 about .",
    "the cr and co majority states form a common band and the weight at the fermi level is mainly of cr character .",
    "the minority occupied states are mainly of co character . when we substitute cr for co , the effect on the atomic dos of the co and cr atoms at the perfect sites is marginal .",
    "the dos of the impurity cr atoms has a completely different form from the cr atoms at the perfect sites due to the different symmetry of the site where they sit .",
    "but although cr impurity atoms at the antisites induce minority states within the gap , there is still a tiny gap and the fermi level falls within this gap keeping the half - metallic character of the parent compounds .",
    "the discussion above on the conservation of the half - metallicity is confirmed when we compare the calculated total moments in table [ table_hmfi ] with the values predicted by the slater pauling rule for the ideal half - metals .",
    "since cr is lighter than co , substitution of cr for co decreases the total number of valence electrons and the total spin moment should also decrease .",
    "this is achieved due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between the cr impurity atoms and the co and cr ones at the ideal sites , which would have an important negative contribution to the total moment as confirmed by the results in table [ table_hmfi ] .",
    "thus the cr - doped alloys are half - metallic ferrimagnets and their total spin moment is considerable smaller than the perfect half - metallic ferromagnetic parent compounds ; in the case of [ co@xmath27cr@xmath28@xmath0cral it decreases down to 1.8 @xmath14 from the 3 @xmath14 of the perfect co@xmath0cral alloy .",
    "here we have to mention that if also co atoms migrate to cr sites ( case of atomic swaps ) the half - metallity is lost , as it was shown by miura et al .",
    "@xcite , due to the energy position of the co states which have migrated at cr sites .",

    "we have taken into account five different values for the concentration @xmath19 ; @xmath19= 0 , 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 . in figure [ fig_hmfi2 ]",
    "we have drawn the total density of states ( dos ) for both families of compounds under study and for two different values of the concentration @xmath19 : the perfect compounds ( @xmath19=0 ) and for one case with defects , @xmath19= 0.1 .",
    "as mentioned above and in agreement with previous previous electronic structure calculations on these compounds co@xmath0mnsi compounds present a real gap and co@xmath0mnal a pseudogap.@xcite when we create a surplus of mn atoms which migrate at sites occupied by co atoms in the perfect alloys , the gap persists and both compounds retain their half - metallic character as occurs also for the cr - based alloys presented above . especially for co@xmath0mnsi , the creation of mn antisites does not alter the width of the gap and the half - metallicity is extremely robust in these alloys with respect to the creation of mn antisites .",
    "the atomic spin moments show behavior similar to the cr alloys as can be seen in table [ table_hmfi ] and the spin moments of the mn impurity atoms are antiferromagnetically coupled to the spin moments of the co and mn atoms at the perfect sites resulting to the desired half - metallic ferrimagnetism .    the ideal case of fully - compensated half - metallic ferrimagnet or half - metallic antiferromagnetic ( hma ) can be achieved by doping with co the mn@xmath0val and mn@xmath0vsi alloys which are well known to be hmfi .",
    "the importance of this route stems from the existence of mn@xmath0val in the heusler @xmath4 phase as shown by several groups.@xcite each mn atom has a spin moment of around -1.5 @xmath14 and v atom a moment of about 0.9 @xmath14.@xcite    all theoretical studies on mn@xmath0val agree on the half - metallic character with a gap at the spin - up band instead of the spin - down band as for the other half - metallic heusler alloys.@xcite prior to the presentation of our results we have to note that due to the slater - pauling rule , these compounds with less than 24 valence electrons have negative total spin moments and the gap is located at the spin - up band .",

    "<S> intermetallic heusler alloys are amongst the most attractive half - metallic systems due to the high curie temperatures and the structural similarity to the binary semiconductors . in this review we present an overview of the basic electronic and magnetic properties of the half - metallic full - heusler alloys like co@xmath0mnge . </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio results suggest that the electronic and magnetic properties in these compounds are intrinsically related to the appearance of the minority - spin gap . </S>",
    "<S> the total spin magnetic moment in the unit cell , @xmath1 , scales linearly with the number of the valence electrons , @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 for the full - heusler alloys opening the way to engineer new half - metallic alloys with the desired magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we present analytical results on the disorder in co@xmath0cr(mn)al(si ) alloys , which is susceptible to destroy the perfect half - metallicity of the bulk compounds and thus degrade the performance of devices . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss the appearance of the half - metallic ferrimagnetism due to the creation of cr(mn ) antisites in these compounds and the co - doping in mn@xmath0val(si ) alloys which leads to the fully - compensated half - metallic ferrimagnetism . </S>"
