    "models that can become trapped in one of an infinite number of absorbing configurations ( inac ) exhibit unusual spreading dynamics at their critical point .",
    "the most intensively studied model of this kind is the pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite .",
    "inac appears to be particularly relevant to the transition to spatio - temporal chaos , as shown in a recent study of a coupled - map lattice with ` laminar ' and ` turbulent ' states , which revealed continuously variable spreading exponents @xcite .",
    "anomalies in critical spreading for inac ( such as continuously variable critical exponents ) have been traced to a long memory in the dynamics of the order parameter , @xmath6 , arising from a coupling to an auxiliary field that remains frozen in regions where @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "grassberger , chat and rousseau ( gcr ) @xcite proposed that spreading in models with inac could be understood more easily by studying a model with a _",
    "unique _ absorbing configuration , but with a long memory of its initial preparation .",
    "the gcr model is a variant of bond directed percolation ( dp ) in which bonds connecting to  virgin \" sites ( i.e. , that have never been occupied ) , have a transmission probability , @xmath8 , that may differ from the value , @xmath9 , for bonds to  used \" sites . used sites follow the usual dp rule .",
    "if site @xmath10 has been occupied previously , then the probability that @xmath10 is occupied at time @xmath11 is @xmath9 if either @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( but not both ) are occupied at time @xmath14 , @xmath15 if both sites are occupied at time @xmath14 , and zero if neither is occupied . for virgin sites",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is replaced by @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamics begins ( as in all spreading experiments ) with activity restricted to a small region of the lattice .",
    "grassberger et al .",
    "found in simulations that in 1 + 1 dimension , the critical point remains at @xmath16 , the standard bond dp value @xcite , independent of @xmath8 .",
    "they concluded that for @xmath17 , the survival probability @xmath1 decays faster than any power of @xmath14 , at the critical point @xmath18 .    in this work",
    "we study one - dimensional _ compact _ directed percolation ( cdp ) @xcite , so called because gaps can not arise within a string of occupied sites .",
    "being exactly soluble , cdp provides a valuable test for ideas on scaling in absorbing - state phase transitions .",
    "for example , dor and menyhard recently found a continuously - variable survival exponent for cdp confined to a fixed parabolic region @xcite .",
    "the rules of standard cdp are as for dp , described above , except that if both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are occupied at time @xmath14 , then @xmath10 _ must _ be occupied at time @xmath11 .",
    "( note that cdp possesses two absorbing states : all vacant , and all occupied . )",
    "if the process starts with only a single occupied site , the state at any later time is specified by the positions of a pair of random walkers , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which mark the extent of the occupied region .",
    "( specifically , the occupied sites are : @xmath21 . ) if we take the origin as the position of the original  seed \" particle , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "the stochastic evolution of @xmath20 is given by    @xmath25    while for @xmath19 the roles of @xmath9 and @xmath26 are interchanged .",
    "thus the length @xmath27 of the occupied region itself executes a random walk with transition probabilities :    @xmath28    the state @xmath29 ( all sites vacant ) is absorbing . in this work",
    "we focus on the case @xmath30 since for smaller ( larger ) values @xmath31 is attracted to ( driven away from ) the origin .",
    "well known results on random walks @xcite imply that for ( @xmath32 , the survival probability @xmath33 , while the mean - square displacement , if the walker has not hit the origin up to time @xmath14 , follows @xmath34 .",
    "( the average is over trials that survive until time @xmath14 or longer . )",
    "the latter implies an active region ( in surviving trials ) of extent @xmath35 , so that the mean number of occupied sites , averaged over all trials , is @xmath36 . in the usual notation of absorbing - state phase transitions @xcite ,",
    "these results imply the exponent values @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "( the exponents are defined via the relations @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . )",
    "these values satisfy the expected hyperscaling relation for a compact growth process in @xmath43 dimensions @xcite : @xmath44    now we introduce a memory effect in cdp along the lines proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "suppose that initially sites other than the origin harbor static  antiparticles \" ( or  mines \" ) , independently with probability @xmath0 .",
    "if site @xmath10 has a mine , then the first particle to venture there is destroyed , and along with it the mine , so that in future , site @xmath10 can be occupied as in normal cdp . in terms of the random walkers @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 , a mine is effectively a reflecting boundary : the first time @xmath19 attempts to visit site @xmath10 ( mined ) , it is reflected back to @xmath13 , and at the same time the reflector moves to @xmath12 ; similarly , @xmath20 will be reflected back to @xmath12 on its first visit to @xmath10 , if it harbors a mine . for @xmath45",
    "our model represents the spread of activity into a hostile environment , for example the advance of a bacterial colony in a medium , with a preliminary contact facilitating expansion into new regions , or , similarly , the spread of a political viewpoint in an initially skeptical population .",
    "we recently studied a simplified version of this problem , involving a single random walker on the nonnegative integers @xcite .",
    "the walker is unbiased , and starts at @xmath46 , with @xmath47 absorbing .",
    "the reflector is initially at @xmath48 . on each visit to a new site ,",
    "the walker is reflected with probability @xmath0 , and the reflector moves forward by one site .",
    "asymptotic analysis of the probability generating function shows that the survival probability exponent varies continuously with @xmath0 : @xmath49 . in this work",
    "we analyze the two - walker problem defined above , corresponding to a spreading cdp process .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    "we show how cdp with reflectors can be represented ( despite the long memory ) as a discrete - time markov process .",
    "we proceed to define an appropriate state space and the associated transition probabilities . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the results of numerical iteration of the probability evolution equations , yielding precision estimates of the critical exponent @xmath3 and other asymptotic scaling properties .",
    "iv presents a summary and discussion .",
    "to investigate the scaling properties of cdp with reflectors , it is convenient to enlarge the state space to include the positions of the reflectors ; this renders the process markovian .",
    "[ the process @xmath50 is evidently non - markovian .",
    "] we consider cdp in one dimension , starting from a single active site .",
    "the evolution of the active region is represented by the motion of a pair of unbiased random walkers , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "each time a walker tries to jump to a new site it pushes a reflector ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) to the left or right , and in the process the walker is reflected back with probability @xmath0 ; it remains at the new position with probability @xmath53 .",
    "the generic configuration is : @xmath54 due to translation invariance , we require only three variables , @xmath10 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , defined as follows : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 then the distance between the walkers ( i.e. , the number of occupied sites ) , is @xmath60 ; @xmath61 is the absorbing state .",
    "we start with the walkers a unit distance apart , and the reflectors one lattice spacing away from the walkers , so that , initially , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . at each time",
    "step the walkers jump to the left or right with equal probabilities .",
    "@xmath56 is nondecreasing , with @xmath64 , since the separation between reflectors can increase by at most two spacings at each step .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the probability of state @xmath66 at time @xmath14 .",
    "transitions @xmath67 may be grouped into three classes .",
    "the simplest is for @xmath10 and @xmath55 both greater than zero .",
    "then @xmath56 can not change , since the walkers do not encounter the reflectors , and we have @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; each of these has a transition probability @xmath71 .",
    "next consider @xmath72 .",
    "there are six possible transitions , listed , along with their probabilitites , in table i. ( the transition probabilities for @xmath73 are obtained by noting that @xmath74 is symmetric under the simultaneous interchange of @xmath10 and @xmath55 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 . )    [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab6 ]    table vi .",
    "numerical results .",
    "table vi also contains results for the amplitude @xmath77 of the mean activity , defined via @xmath78 and for the asymptotic moment ratio @xmath79 the amplitude decreases smoothly with @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "3 . @xmath80 is a measure of the shape of the position distribution . for @xmath81",
    "our numerical estimate is consistent with @xmath82 , as expected for brownian motion on the line with the origin reflecting , for which the asymptotic probability density is @xmath83 $ ] , with @xmath84 .",
    "the ratio decreases steadily with @xmath0 , but not by very much ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , showing that the random walk result still serves as a reasonable approximation for @xmath45 .",
    "the moment ratio @xmath80 takes the same values in both versions of the process , confirming that it is a universal quantity .",
    "the effect of the reflectors is clearly evident in the distribution in the number of active sites , @xmath85 .",
    "4 compares @xmath85 for @xmath86 , 0.5 , and 1 , ( for @xmath87 time steps , two - step process ) , showing that the distribution shifts to smaller @xmath88 values with increasing reflection probability @xmath0 .",
    "( note that for @xmath86 , @xmath89 for @xmath90 odd .",
    "we have therefore multiplied the distribution for @xmath86 by one half , to facilitate comparison with the other cases . ) despite the changes in form , the tail of the distribution remains gaussian in all cases .",
    "we have studied spreading in compact directed percolation on a one - dimensional lattice at its critical point , modified so that activation of virgin sites is less probable than reactivation of a previously active site .",
    "the problem is equivalent to a pair of random walkers subject to movable partial reflectors .",
    "two variants are considered : the two - step process , in which both walkers move at each step , and a one - step process , in which , at each step , only one walker ( selected at random ) jumps .",
    "we study these processes via exact numerical iteration of the probability distribution for finite times ( @xmath91 time steps ) .",
    "we find that the survival probability critical exponent @xmath3 varies continuously with @xmath0 .",
    "our results indicate a weak nonlinearity in the function @xmath92 , despite the fact that the data are rather well represented by a simple linear expression , eq .",
    "( [ conj ] ) .",
    "since , in the case of a single random walker subject to a partial movable reflector @xcite , we found a strictly linear dependence of the survival probability exponent on @xmath0 , this nonlinearity is somewhat surprising . on the other hand , the present problem is related to splitting probabilities on a two - dimensional domain ( rather than on the line , as is the case for a single walker ) , allowing for a more complicated functional dependence .",
    "our finding of a continuously - variable survival probability exponent is fully consistent with previous results for the single walker .",
    "one may , moreover , understand the fact that @xmath3 increases more rapidly with @xmath0 than for the single walker , since in cdp the spreading process feels the effects of _ two _ reflectors . in the absence of an exact analysis or rigorous argument , however , we have no qualitative understanding of the values for @xmath92 that we have found numerically .",
