    "recent experimental work have suggested that the geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) is related to the l - h transition and transport barriers .",
    "gams are axisymmetric poloidal @xmath0 flows with finite frequencies ( @xmath1 ) coupled to up - down - antisymmetric pressure perturbations , which provides a restoring force of the oscillation .",
    "the experimental results indicate a periodic modulation of flow and turbulence level with the characteristic limit cycle oscillation at the gam frequency . in simulations , it was observed that gams are only somewhat less effective than the residual zonal flow in providing the non - linear saturation . in particular ,",
    "it was found in ref  @xcite , that the damping rates of the gam are significantly influenced by coupling to higher @xmath2-modes .",
    "the ion temperature gradient ( itg ) mode driven by a combination of ion temperature gradients and field line curvature effects is a likely candidate for driving ion scale turbulence , transport and flows .",
    "the generation of large scale modes such as zonal flows and gams by itg modes is here realized through the wave kinetic equation ( wke ) analysis .",
    "this analysis is based on the coupling of the micro - scale turbulence with the gam through the wke under the assumptions that there is a large separation of scales in space and time  @xcite . in the present work the effects of the second harmonics of the density and temperature perturbations on the linear gam frequency and non - linear generation of the gam , using a fluid model  @xcite are investigated .",
    "we show that the second harmonics contribute to the frequency with higher order terms in @xmath3 similar to what was discovered in ref  @xcite .",
    "in addition , effects of plasma shaping will be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the description used for toroidal itg driven modes consists of the ion continuity , ion temperature equations and ion parallel momentum . for simplicity ,",
    "effects of electron trapping and finite beta effects are neglected in this work .",
    "the ion - temperature and ion - continuity equations can be written  @xcite @xmath4 + \\left[\\phi , \\nabla^2_{\\perp } \\phi \\right ] + \\tau \\left[\\phi , \\nabla^2_{\\perp } \\left ( n + t_i\\right ) \\right ] \\label{eq:1.03}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}_i}{\\partial t } - \\frac{5}{3 } \\tau \\epsilon_n g \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}_i}{\\partial y } + \\left ( \\eta_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y } - \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{n}}{\\partial t } = \\nonumber \\\\ - \\left[\\phi , t_i \\right ] + \\frac{2}{3 } \\left[\\phi , n \\right ] .",

    "we also define @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the major radius and @xmath18 .",
    "the perturbed variables are normalized with the additional definitions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 as the normalized ion particle density , the electrostatic potential and the ion temperature , respectively .",
    "the perpendicular length scale and time are normalized to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . here",

    "the geometrical quantities will first be considered in the strong ballooning limit ( @xmath25 , @xmath26  @xcite where @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 ) . moreover",
    "we will also employ semi - local approximation as follows  @xcite , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 will be replaced by the averages defined through the integrals @xmath32 for a simple approximate eigen - function @xmath33",
    "the derivation of the dispersion relation for the geodesic acoustic modes including the @xmath34 higher harmonic coupling to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 components is described here .",
    "the ga mode is defined as having @xmath37 , @xmath38 perturbation of the potential field and the @xmath39 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 perturbation in the density , temperatures and the parallel velocity perturbations .",
    "in addition we will now consider the @xmath34 components of the density , temperature and parallel velocity perturbations .",
    "in total seven coupled differential equations are solved by fourier components .",
    "the ga mode is described by ( @xmath40 ) and its growth rate is induced by an itg mode ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , only the final gam dispersion relation will be displayed here , @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the saturation level of the itg turbulence and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are coefficients expressing the effects of the higher harmonics .",
    "the wave kinetic equation ( wke ) analysis is based on the coupling of the micro - scale turbulence with the gam through the wke under the assumptions that there is a large separation of scales in space and time  @xcite . in this simplified analysis only the reynolds stress term is retained .",

    "the scaling is however independent of @xmath52 and the frequency is increased by about 10% by including the @xmath34 mode in the analysis .",
    "figure 2 displays the linear gam frequency normalized by @xmath50 as a function of the gam wave number @xmath53 .",
    "note that in the @xmath35 case the frequency is independent of @xmath53 whereas for @xmath34 the frequency sharply increases with increasing @xmath53 . in figure 3 ,",

    "the effects of geometry is determined by a semi - local analysis similar to the work done in ref .",
    "@xcite however here modified to allow for varying elongation as well as magnetic shear and safety factor .",
    "the other parameters are close to those of the cyclone base case @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the effects of elongation is weakly stabilizing the gam by reducing the growth rate whereas the frequency first decreases and then increases for larger values of @xmath54 . here",
    "the mode coupling saturation level is assumed  @xcite .",
    "a system of equations is derived which describes the dynamics of the geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) including the coupling to higher harmonics ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the wave - kinetic ( wk ) formalism is used to derive the driving term for the gam growth rate .",
    "it has been suggested in experimental work that the gam is related to the l - h transition and transport barriers making it pertinent to analytically explore the properties of the gam in detail . in addition",
    ", we have included the effects of plasma shaping through a semi - local analysis , however due to the complexity of the resulting integrals closed analytical forms are not available .",
    "we have found that the gam frequency is significantly altered by including the coupling to higher harmonics , generally increasing the frequency .",
    "the effects of elongation is less decisive however a weakly stabilizing effect is present . in future",
    "work work the sub - dominant non - linear interactions will be investigated as well as more parameters studies .",
