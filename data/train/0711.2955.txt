    "the binary system xx leonis ( sv * p 3370 , an 355.1934 , bd+14 2177 ) was discovered to be a variable by @xcite .",
    "it is an eclipsing binary star of @xmath6 magnitude , the period is close to one day and the depth of primary minimum is about 0.5 mag .",
    "the spectral type of the primary is a9v and of secondary k0 .",
    "it was included in a catalogue of apsidal motion binaries by @xcite , but this hypothesis was rejected .",
    "the preliminary solution of the light curve ( using washington filter system ) computed by @xcite classified xx leo as a near - contact binary , but the period analysis indicates constant period .",
    "the second analysis with satisfactory data was performed by stark et al . in 2000 but with only r and v light curves and also without a satisfactory light curve solution .",
    "so the masses of the components are still not very convincing .",
    "we assume here @xmath7 , according to the derived spectral types from the previous analysis .",
    "the new light elements derived from our period analysis using 57 minimum times ( see figure [ fig : lite ] ) for xx leo are : @xmath8   & & \\hspace{18.5 mm } \\pm 0.\\!0076 \\pm 0.\\!\\!^{\\rm d}000000473 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have measured the light curves using standard bessell b , v , r , and i filter system with the 20-cm telescope and st-7 ccd detector .",
    "these measurements were done in private observatory in brno , czech republic , during 20 nights in spring 2006 . in the figure  [ fig : lc ]",
    "you can see the theoretical curves with the individual data points .",
    "these measurements were analysed using the phoebe programme ( see @xcite ) , based on the wilson - devinney code ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . the final values for both components for the temperatures ( @xmath9 ) , mass ratio ( @xmath10 ) , inclination ( @xmath11 ) , relative luminosities ( @xmath12 ) , limb - darkening ( @xmath13 , interpolated from the van - hamme s tables ) , albedo ( @xmath14 ) and gravity darkening ( @xmath15 ) coefficients and synchronicity parameters ( @xmath16 ) , respectively , are in the table [ tab : par ] .",
    "we have used the `` double contact binary '' mode during the computation , because of the best numerical result , the best agreement with the previous results ( primary and secondary spectral type a9 and k0 , respectively ) and also the period analysis .",
    "regrettably we have no rv curve , so we can not estimate another parameters more precisely , for example the masses and dimensions of the system .",
    "the mass ratio computed only from the photometry is not very reliable .",
    "spectroscopy of xx leo would help us to estimate these parameters .    from the mass of the potential third body ( about @xmath17 , from the period analysis )",
    "we could conclude that this star on the main sequence should be g9 spectral type . also from the light curve analysis",
    "we can see that this body has almost the same luminosity as the secondary component , so both approaches lead to the same result .",
    "the previous period analysis of xx leo was performed by @xcite , but no significant variation was found because of small data set . also in the paper by @xcite was found that the period of the binary is constant .",
    "we have used 57 minimum times covering more than 80 years . in the figure [ fig : lite ] , there are individual minimum times marked as dots and circles for the primary and secondary minimum , respectively .",
    "we can see no evident displacement of secondary minima , so the apsidal motion could be ruled out .",
    "bigger the symbol , bigger the weight . also the light - time effect hypothesis curve is shown .",
    "the final results of the fit are in the table [ tab : lite ] .",
    "we have fixed the value of eccentricity to zero because of the best agreement with the photometric results .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services .",
    "this investigation was supported by the grant agency of the czech republic , grant no .",
