    "there have been many progresses for nonconforming finite element methods for many mechanical problems for last decades .",
    "nonconforming elements have been a favorite choice in solving the stokes and navier - stokes equations @xcite in a stable manner .",
    "also , the nonconforming nature facilitates resolving numerical locking @xcite in elasticity problems the lowest order nonconforming elements have been especially popular numerical methods because of its simplicity and stability property @xcite .",
    "we briefly review some progresses for nonconforming rectangular or quadrilateral elements .",
    "han introduced firstly a rectangular element which assumes five local degrees of freedom ( dofs ) @xcite in 1984 .",
    "then in 1992 rannacher and turek introduced the rotated @xmath0 nonconforming elements with two types of degrees of freedom @xcite : the four edge - midpoint value dofs and the four edge integral dofs .",
    "chen @xcite also used the first type of dofs for the same rotated @xmath0 element .",
    "douglas , santos , sheen and ye introduced a new nonconforming finite element , which we call the _ dssy element _ in this paper , for which the two types of degrees of freedom are coincident on rectangular ( or parallelogram ) meshes @xcite .",
    "arnold , boffi , and falk provided a theory of convergence order in quadrilateral meshes @xcite .",
    "a modified dssy element was introduced in @xcite , which requires an additional dof in order to retain an optimal convergence order for genuinely quadrilateral meshes .",
    "it seems impossible to reduce the number of dofs from five to four as long as one considers a parametric dssy - type element on quadrilateral meshes and still wants to preserve optimal convergence .",
    "the aim of this paper is to attempt to extend the spirit of rectangular dssy element to genuinely quadrilateral meshes keeping the mean value property with four dofs , shifting from the parametric realm to the nonparametric one .",
    "our starting point is based on a clever decomposition of a bilinear map into a simple bilinear map followed by an affine map @xcite .",
    "this approach induces an intermediate reference quadrilateral , where a four dof dssy - type element can be defined .",
    "then the affine map will preserve @xmath1 and the mean value property on each edge .",
    "we remark that the quadrilateral element introduced in @xcite is of only three dofs , and a similar element was introduced by hu and shi @xcite , but without any modification they can not be used to solve fluid and solid mechanics in a stable manner .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review some specific properties of the dssy element . then using the decomposition of a bilinear map into a simple bilinear map followed by an affine map",
    ", we introduce a family of quadrilateral elements on an intermediate reference quadrilateral , which is of four dofs . based on this",
    ", we define a family of nonparametric quadrilateral elements .",
    "section 3 is devoted to numerical experiments .",
    "the performance of the new nonparametric dssy elements and the parametric dssy element is compared in terms of computation time where the nonparametric dssy elements show a clear advantage over the parametric one .",
    "in this section we will introduce a nonparametric dssy element of four local degrees of freedom .",
    "first of all let us review the ( parametric ) dssy element in brief .",
    "let @xmath2 be a simply connected polygonal domain in @xmath3 and @xmath4 be a family of shape regular quadrilateral triangulations of @xmath2 with @xmath5 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath6 the set of all edges in @xmath7 .",

    "the linear polynomials @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined in a way that two line equations @xmath19 , @xmath20 pass through @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , respectively .",

    "we use the similar notations for vertices , edges , midpoints of @xmath26 as those of @xmath9 such as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be any quadrilateral .",
    "then there exists a bilinear map @xmath32 such that @xmath33 notice that @xmath34 can be written as follows : @xmath35    set @xmath36 where @xmath37    then the degrees of freedom for the dssy element can be chosen as either four mean values over edges or four edge - midpoint values , which turn out to be identical . in other words ,",
    "the dssy elements fulfill the _",
    "mean value property _ : @xmath38    in order to retain an optimal convergence order for any quadrilateral mesh , the parametric dssy element needs an additional element @xmath39 , and therefore the modified reference element reads @xmath40 with an additional degree of freedom @xmath41 the dssy element on @xmath9 is then defined by @xmath42 where @xmath34 is defined by .",
    "the global parametric dssy element is defined by @xmath43      we are interested in reducing the five degrees of freedom dssy element to four , but still retaining the _",

    ", @xmath49 is not a quartic polynomial in general if @xmath9 is a genuine quadrilateral , that is , if @xmath34 is not an affine map . in most cases",
    "it is a non - polynomial function .",
    "thus @xmath50 would not be similarly regarded as the product of zero level set functions of three geometrical objects , such as two lines and a circle .",
    "this seems to be one of the limits of using parametric elements .",
    "we will thus divert from using the parametric elements and investigate a suitable four degrees of freedom element .      to design such a suitable element",

    "a bilinear map @xmath51 is said to be a _",
