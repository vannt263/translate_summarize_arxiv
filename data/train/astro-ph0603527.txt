    "the study of variable stars in local group galaxies has played an important role in our understanding of the universe .",
    "traditionally variable stars have served as one of the prime tools for determining the local distance scale .",
    "the discovery by leavitt ( 1908 ; leavitt and pickering  1912 ) of the period - luminosity relation for cepheids in the magellanic clouds and the use of this relation by hubble ( 1925 , 1926 , 1929 ) on cepheids in ngc 6822 , m33 and m31 enabled the modern view that these are all galaxies located outside the milky way .    in recent years",
    "large - scale photometric variability surveys have revolutionized the study of variable stars .",
    "dark matter searches such as eros @xcite , macho @xcite , moa @xcite and ogle @xcite have released catalogues of more than two hundred thousand variables in the galactic bulge and more than sixty thousand variables in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "these surveys have shown that completely new science can be done with very large samples of variable stars .",
    "for example , a few of the results based on these catalogues include the discovery of multiple period - luminosity relations for mira - like variables @xcite , the discovery of beat cepheids in the lmc @xcite and the discovery of a period - luminosity relation for ellipsoidal variations observed in lmc red giants @xcite .",
    "while the magellanic clouds have been surveyed extensively by the microlensing searches , larger and more distant galaxies such as m31 and m33 have only been targeted with ccds by relatively narrow - field variability surveys . with the advent of wide - field mosaic imagers",
    "it has become possible to perform a complete survey of these galaxies without the use of a dedicated telescope .",
    "motivated by this opportunity , we have conducted a variability survey of the nearby galaxy m33 ( 01:33:51.00 + 30:39:36.7 j2000 ) using the megaprime / megacam instrument on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii - telescope ( cfht ) atop mauna kea .",
    "there have been several previous variability studies of m33 .",
    "the first variable stars in this galaxy were found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite then found cepheids in m33 , thereby showing that this nebula is actually a galaxy at a distance of 263 kpc .",
    "@xcite investigated a handful of the brightest variables in m33 and discovered the hubble - sandage class ( now called luminous blue variables ) . following",
    "this work @xcite conducted a survey to find the brightest variables in m33 discovering 38 new variables .",
    "the last major photographic variability survey was conducted by @xcite .",
    "most recently the direct project conducted the first ccd variability survey of m33 discovering more than a thousand variables ( macri et al .",
    "2001 ; mochejska et al .  2001a ,  2001b ) in the centre of this galaxy .",
    "m33 has also been the target of several single ( or few ) epoch photometric surveys , with the survey by massey et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter m06 ) as the most recent example .",
    "our present survey has two improvements for finding variables over previous surveys of m33 .",
    "the first is that by using a 3.6 metre telescope we go deeper than any previous survey .",
    "the second is that we are able to cover a much wider field ( essentially the entire galaxy ) than previously possible for ccd surveys . as a result",
    "we have detected 36709 variable sources which represents an increase by more than a factor of 20 in the number of known variables in the field of m33 .    in the following section",
    "we discuss the observations . in ",
    "3 we describe the data reduction and we present the catalogue of variable sources in  4 .",
    "we describe a few of the ensemble properties of these variables in  5 and conclude with a few summary remarks in  6 .",
    "the data were obtained using the queue service observing mode at the cfht on 27 separate nights between august 2003 , and january 2005 .",
    "we used the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 sloan filters , obtaining 36 images centred on the galaxy with each filter . the seeing varied from @xmath7 in @xmath6 . for the 2003 observations we used an exposure time of 530 s for @xmath4 , and 660 s for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the 2004 season we switched to 480 s for @xmath4 and 600 s for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] lists the dates of observations , the number of images obtained in each filter on these dates , and the median seeing for each filter .",
    ".observations of m33 [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also compared our catalogue with the lists of variables found by the direct project .",
    "we find matches within @xmath8 to 1092 out of 1430 distinct variable sources .",
    "of the 338 variables that we do not match with , @xmath9 lie on or near a chip gap or near an image artifact .",
    "an inspection of the spatial distribution of direct sources that did not match to our catalogue revealed that many of these sources are located near the densest part of the image where crowding is particularly significant and thus the coordinates are uncertain .",
    "we find that when comparing to the direct ab catalogue @xcite the median matching error is @xmath10 , while for the direct a and b catalogues ( mochejska et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) the matching error is @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "we have also matched our data to a catalogue of chandra x - ray sources in m33 @xcite , and a catalogue of h-@xmath13 line emission candidates @xcite .",
    "we find that out of 261 distinct chandra sources , 60 have an optical variable counterpart , where we used a matching radius of @xmath14 plus the uncertainty in the chandra position .",
    "for the match to calzetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) we find that 58 out of the 153 sources have a counterpart in our catalogue when using a matching radius of @xmath15 .",
    "the ids for these matches are provided in the comments column of the catalogue .",
    "a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is perhaps the simplest plot one can make that reveals information about the classes of variables present in a catalogue . in fig",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we present @xmath16 vs. @xmath5 and @xmath17 vs. @xmath6 cmds with and without the variables .    in fig  [ fig : frac_var ]",
    "we show the fraction of stars on the cmds that were detected as variables . while biased , this plot allows us to identify several striking groups of variables .",
    "two features that are immediately apparent are the cepheid instability strip ( is ) located between the main sequence and giant branches and the red long period variables ( lpvs ) at @xmath18 .",
    "not unexpectedly there is a sizeable group of variables along the main sequence at @xmath19 , though the fraction of stars in this region that are variable does not increase dramatically .",
    "we also identify two groups of variables near the bright end of the main sequence and giant branches  at @xmath5 @xmath20 18 to 19 , and @xmath16 @xmath20 -0.2 and + 1.4 , respectively .",
    "these we refer to tentatively as variable blue and red supergiant stars ; they may be related to the @xmath13-cygni type variables which are semi - regular pulsating supergiants ( see for example sterken 1996 ) .",
    "the majority of variable candidates blueward of @xmath21 or @xmath22 likely have incorrect magnitudes in at least one filter since they occur predominately in , and uniformly across , a handful of chips near the centre of the galaxy where magnitude measurements and matching between filters is the most uncertain .        to find the blue and red edges of the is , and the blue edge of the lpv region , we plot the fraction of stars that are detected as variable with @xmath23 mag as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 colours in fig  [ fig : colourdist ] .",
    "we determine this fraction for stars with @xmath24 between @xmath25 and @xmath26 in bins of width @xmath27 mag .",
    "the location of the is is visible in each of these distributions as a peak located between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "redward of the is the fraction of stars that are variable rises until it reaches a break at around @xmath30 after which the rise is slower .",
    "we fit a simple model to the observed distribution of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 term is used to fit the distribution blueward of @xmath36 , the first broken power - law is used to fit the is and the second broken power - law is used to fit the lpv ridge . for the @xmath17 distributions between @xmath37",
    "we include a third broken power - law to account for the observed bump in the lpv region , particularly noticeable for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 bins . using this simple model",
    "we can define four interesting locations .",
    "the first is the peak in the is given by @xmath40 ( similarly for @xmath17 ) .",
    "the second and third are the blue and red edges of the is , which we will take to be the colours at which the fraction of stars that are variable falls to a tenth its value at the peak , and which we approximate by @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the final location of interest is the blue edge of the lpv region which we take to be the location of the first break redward of the is and is given by @xmath43 .        in fig",
    "[ fig : key ] we plot the measured positions of the peak in the is , its blue and red edges , and the blue edge of the lpv region .",
    "we fit a line through the blue and red edges of the cepheid is and the blue edge of the lpv region and find that these locations are given approximately by the relations @xmath44 using these relations we show the approximate locations of is and lpv stars in fig  [ fig : key ] .",
    "we also identify regions around the red and blue supergiant branches that have an increased fraction of variability .          as a demonstration of our photometry we plot the @xmath45 light curves for several example variables from each of the four regions identified in fig  [ fig : key ] . in fig  [ fig : cepheidlc ]",
    "we plot phased differential magnitude light curves for several cepheids sorted by increasing period .",
    "we have set the faintest point in each light curve to have magnitude zero so that variations in colour as well as luminosity are apparent . in fig",
    "[ fig : lpvlc ] we plot the light curves for several lpvs .",
    "we do not phase these light curves or re - scale them . in fig",
    "[ fig : acygbluelc ] we plot differential magnitude light curves for several variable blue supergiant candidates , and in fig  [ fig : acygredlc ] we plot differential magnitude light curves for several variable red supergiant candidates .",
    "the variable blue supergiants show variations on substantially shorter time - scales than the red variables , they also tend to have lower amplitudes than the red ones .                      in figs .",
    "[ fig : spatialdist_ceph]-[fig : spatialdist_vrsg ] we show the spatial distributions of the variables identified in fig .  [ fig : key ] .",
    "as expected the long period variables appear to trace the diffuse disk population , while the other classes of variables show a correlation with the spiral arms .",
    "note that the variable red supergiant stars also appear to be correlated with the spiral arms , this suggests that many of these variables are in fact red supergiant stars in m33 rather than foreground giants .                      in fig .",
    "[ fig : cepheid_pl ] we show a preliminary period - magnitude diagram for the variables that lie in the cepheid is and have pulsation - like light curves .",
    "the magnitude plotted is the mean @xmath5 magnitude determined from fitting a fourier series to the light curves .",
    "we show this diagram to illustrate the quality and abundance of data available for cepheids .",
    "we will conduct an analysis of the cepheid population of m33 in a future contribution .",
    "we have identified more than 36,000 variable sources in m33 and are releasing photometry for all of them with multi - filter data for many of them .",
    "this makes m33 now comparable to either of the magellanic cloud galaxies in terms of the sheer number of variable stars that are known .",
    "these data already make possible a number of interesting projects .",
    "studies of the period - luminosity - colour relation for cepheids in m33 , and a test of its dependence on metallicity can be done with these data .",
    "this will be done when the photometry is properly calibrated .",
    "investigations of the @xmath46 or amplitude distributions of variables can be done using this relatively uniform data set .",
    "studies of the eclipsing binary and ellipsoidal variable populations could be undertaken . and , with continued observations of this galaxy",
    ", it will be possible to study the lpv population for a galaxy beyond the magellanic clouds .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the cfht qso observers who made this project possible , the hawaiian people for allowing us to use a sacred mountain , g.  pojmanski for his excellent `` lc '' program and j.  devor for his period - finding code .",
