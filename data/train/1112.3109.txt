    "according to taubes theorem @xcite there exist a huge number of compact oriented 4-manifolds which admit a self - dual conformal structure .",
    "associated to any self - dual structure is a 3-dimensional complex manifold of a special kind , which is so called the _ twistor space _ , but by a theorem of hitchin @xcite a compact twistor space does not admit a khler metric except two standard examples .",
    "also , by a theorem of campana @xcite , a compact twistor space can be moishezon only when the 4-manifold is @xmath1 or @xmath2 , the connected sum of @xmath3 copies of complex projective planes . by kuiper @xcite ,",
    "the standard metric on @xmath1 is the unique self - dual structure on @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , by poon @xcite , the fubini - study metric on @xmath4 is the unique self - dual structure on @xmath4 whose twistor space is moishezon ( or , whose self - dual structure is of positive scalar curvature ) . on @xmath5 , in the same paper , poon constructed a family of moishezon twistor spaces parametrized by an open interval in @xmath6 , and showed that these are all moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath5 . thus the classification of moishezon twistor spaces is completely over up to @xmath5 .    for the case of @xmath7 , by the works of poon @xcite and kreussler - kurke @xcite",
    "a classification was given by means of the complete linear system @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the natural square root of the anticanonical line bundle , which is available on any twistor space .",
    "namely moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath7 can be classified into two types according to whether @xmath8 is base point free or not ; if free , the associated map is a degree two morphism onto @xmath10 and the branch divisor is a quartic surface , whereas if not free , the image of the rational map is a non - singular quadric in @xmath10 , and the twistor space has to be a lebrun twistor space constructed in @xcite whose structure is also well understood .",
    "for the case of @xmath2 , @xmath3 being arbitrary , while a lot of moishezon twistor spaces are already known , their classification seems still difficult . in the first half of this paper ( namely in sections [ s : clsf ] and [ s :",
    "summary ] ) we provide a classification in the case of @xmath0 , by means of the anticanonical system of the twistor spaces . because the most important chern number @xmath11 of a twistor space on @xmath2 is given by @xmath12 , the case of @xmath0",
    "is of particular interest .",
    "we also note that on @xmath0 , the system @xmath8 is not enough for analyzing structure of twistor spaces , since in most cases the system is just a pencil .",
    "a simplified version of our classification may be presented as follows :    [ thm : main1 ] let @xmath13 be a moishezon twistor space on @xmath0 and @xmath14 the anticanonical map of @xmath13 . then exactly one of the following three situations occurs :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 is birational over the image , 2 .",
    "@xmath14 is ( rationally ) two to one over a scroll of 2-planes over a conic ( and hence the scroll is in @xmath15 ) , and the branch divisor is an intersection of the scroll with a quartic hypersurface in @xmath16 , 3 .   the image @xmath17 is 2-dimensional , and general fibers of @xmath14 are non - singular rational curves .",
    "thus the anticanonical map nicely describes the structure of any moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 . according to these three structures ,",
    "let us call a moishezon twistor space @xmath13 on @xmath0 to be _ birational type , double solid type _ or _ conic bundle type _ if @xmath13 belongs to the case ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) respectively .",
    "then what we actually do in section [ s : clsf ] is to investigate each of these three cases much more in detail and to clarify the structure of the anticanonical map as follows .",
    "for a twistor space on @xmath0 which is of birational type , we show that the dimension of the anticanonical system is either 8 or 6 as a linear system .",
    "we also show that if the dimension is 8 the anticanonical image is a ( non - complete ) intersection of 10 quadrics in @xmath18 , and that if the dimension is 6 , the anticanonical image is a complete intersection of three quadrics in @xmath19 ( theorem [ thm : birational ] ) .",
    "the latter spaces are much more general than the former spaces .",
    "any of these twistor spaces actually exist .    for twistor spaces of conic bundle type , we prove that the dimension of the anticanonical system is 8 , 5 , or 4 .",
    "we also show that if the system is 8-dimensional the anticanonical image is an embedded image of a non - singular quadric in @xmath20 by the veronese embedding @xmath21 induced from the system @xmath22 , and that if 5-dimensional the anticanonical image is the veronese surface @xmath4 in @xmath23 .",
    "we also prove that if the anticanonical system is 4-dimensional the anticanonical image is an intersection of two quadrics in @xmath16 , and determine their defining quadratic polynomials in explicit forms ( theorem [ thm : conicbundle ] ) .",
    "thus the structure of the anticanonical image is determined in explicit forms .",
    "again we remark that any of these three kinds of twistor spaces actually exist .    for moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 of double solid type , we classify them into four sub - types i ,",
    "ii , iii and iv , according to the number of the irreducible components of the base curve of the system @xmath24 , or equivalently , according to the difference of the singularities of the branch divisor of the anticanonical map .",
    "( these differences are illustrated in figure [ fig : quartics ] . )",
    "we mention that type i is most general and type iv is most special .",
    "after these classifications , we compute in section [ ss : moduli ] the dimension of the moduli spaces of moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we see that the moduli space takes the highest dimension for twistor spaces investigated by campana - kreussler @xcite and double solid twistor spaces of type i. it is likely that any two moishezon twistor spaces are deformation equivalent , even if we require moishezon property to be preserved in the deformation family .    comparing the classification with the case of @xmath7",
    ", it seems natural to view the twistor spaces of double solid type on @xmath0 as a right generalization of those on @xmath7 having the structure of double covering of @xmath10 .",
    "( indeed the name of double solid type is taken from this . ) since the double covering is mostly determined from the branch divisor , the main issue is to determine the form of the defining polynomial of the quartic hypersurface in @xmath16 which cuts out the branch divisor as the intersection with the scroll , and this is the main topic in the latter half of this paper .",
    "however , there seems to be no easy way for determining this quartic polynomial . in section [ s : acs ] , for this goal we analyze the structure of the anticanonical map for the twistor spaces of double solid type in detail .",
    "in particular we give a sequence of explicit blowups which eliminates the base locus of the anticanonical system of the twistor space .",
    "all the operations are presented in figures .    in section [",
    "s : de ] we determine the quartic polynomial whose zeros cut out the branch divisor of the anticanonical map . in section",
    "[ ss : red ] we find reducible members of the anticanonical system , which consist of two irreducible components .",
    "then in section [ ss : double ] by using these reducible members as well as the results in section [ s : acs ] we find some particular curves on the branch divisor , which bring a strong constraint for the form of the defining equation of the quartic hypersurface .",
    "next in section [ ss : q ] we show that there exists of a quadric which contains all these curves on the branch divisor .",
    "the defining equation of this quadric will be involved in the equation of the quartic hypersurface .",
    "finally in section [ ss : de ] by assembling all these results we obtain the defining polynomial of the quartic hypersurface ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "this paper is a combination of the author s three articles arxiv:1009.3153 , 1108.1443 , and 1109.5427 , minus some detailed construction of the twistor spaces .",
    "i would like to thank masaharu ishikawa for a helpful discussion on topology of varieties with singularities .",
    "also i am grateful to the referee for giving me an opportunity to combine the three articles , which should certainly be much more suitable for presentation",

    "the structure of moishezon twistor spaces satisfying the inequality @xmath45 is well understood by the following result of kreussler @xcite :    [ prop : kr ] let @xmath13 be a twistor space on @xmath0 of positive type as above .    1 .   if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 and @xmath13 is a lebrun twistor space constructed in @xcite .",

    "let @xmath73 be a birational morphism preserving the real structure which maps twistor lines in @xmath51 to @xmath74-curves ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then since the image @xmath75 (= the image which takes the multiplicity into account ) is also an anticanonical curve , it is a @xmath76-curve on @xmath38 , which is real . from the absence of real points on @xmath51 and @xmath38",
    ", we can readily deduce that if @xmath75 has a non - reduced component , the component must be the twice of a real @xmath74-curve .",
    "but if this is really the case , @xmath77 always blows up points on the real @xmath74-curve , which readily means @xmath78 .",
    "this contradicts @xmath79 .",
    "therefore @xmath75 does not have a non - reduced component .",
    "hence possible forms of the @xmath76-curve @xmath75 are the following three situations : @xmath80 where in each possibility two components of the same bidegree are distinct .",

    "for the situation it is obvious that the image @xmath82 is a cycle of smooth rational curves .",

    "moreover since @xmath84 , each step in the birational morphism @xmath85 blows up a point on ( the inverse image of ) @xmath86 .",

    "these are all degree - one divisors on @xmath13 , and play an important role for deriving the defining equation of the image under the anticanonical map of the twistor spaces .",
    "we make distinction for the two components @xmath108 and @xmath109 by promising that @xmath109 contains the component @xmath65 of @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath85 be the birational morphism as in the above proof . then with an aid of the real structure we can factorize @xmath77 as @xmath110 where each @xmath111 blows up a real pair of points on the anticanonical cycle .",
    "moreover , as we have denied the possibility @xmath66 , even when @xmath86 is as in , some @xmath111 has to blowup a pair of singular points of the curve @xmath112 . from this , by choosing a different blowdown to @xmath38",

    "furthermore , by the exact sequence , for any smooth member @xmath51 of the pencil @xmath24 , the restriction of the anticanonical map @xmath138 to @xmath51 can be identified with the bi - anticanonical map of @xmath51 . in the rest of this section using these as basic tools we investigate structure of the anticanonical map of @xmath13 for each of the five values of @xmath34 .      from the proof of proposition [ prop :",

    "it is elementary to see that without loss of generality we may suppose that for the image @xmath141 , which is necessarily a cycle of 10 smooth rational curves , the sequence obtained by putting the self - intersection numbers of the components is given by @xmath142 up to permutations and reversing the order .",
    "therefore all the freedom for giving the toric @xmath51 lie on the choice of a pair of points which are blown - up by @xmath143 .",

    "the last image clearly corresponds to deformations of the pair @xmath530 which are obtained by just moving @xmath51 in the real part of the pencil @xmath24 , while the complex structure of the twistor space @xmath13 is fixed . on the other hand",
    ", it is immediate to see that any real irreducible member @xmath531 also contains the curves @xmath532 and @xmath453 as @xmath533 and @xmath332-curves .",
    "this means that the @xmath514-subspace in @xmath516 generated by the @xmath514-pencil @xmath534 and @xmath535 is real@xmath536 is contained in the subspace @xmath515 .",
    "this means @xmath537 and hence the desired inclusion @xmath538 .",
    "therefore we obtain that the @xmath514-subspace @xmath539 is isomorphic to the quotient space @xmath540 .",
    "since @xmath72 , we obtain that the moduli space of the twistor spaces of double solid type i is @xmath541-dimensional .    in a similar way , concerning other twistor spaces of double solid type , for the dimension of the @xmath514-subspace @xmath523",
    ", we have @xmath542 for the case of type ii , @xmath543 for the case of type iii .",
    "( we also have @xmath544 for the case of type iv .",
    "but we are excluding this case because @xmath496 . ) from these , we obtain that the moduli space is @xmath545-dimensional for the case of type ii , and @xmath475-dimensional for the case of type iii . for the twistor spaces of birational type which satisfy @xmath312",
    ", the @xmath514-subspace @xmath523 is readily seen to be 2-dimensional . hence again by using the moduli space becomes @xmath546-dimensional .",
    "thus we have computed the dimension of the moduli space for those satisfying @xmath320 and @xmath122 .",
    "a similar argument works for computing the dimension of the moduli space of campana - kreussler twistor spaces on @xmath0 which satisfy @xmath492 .",
    "first we readily see that for the @xmath514-subspace @xmath547 we have @xmath548 .",
    "further we have @xmath549 and the image @xmath550 is again contained in @xmath521 by the same reason to the above argument .",
    "hence the dimension of the moduli space is computed as @xmath551 .",
    "we note that by the same argument the moduli space of campana - kreussler twistor spaces on @xmath2 is @xmath552-dimensional .",
    "we also mention that this can obtained in a simpler way by computing @xmath553 , where @xmath554 is the base curve of the net @xmath24 , instead of passing to the surface @xmath51 .         here , in the case of type ii",
    ", @xmath555 is a real number satisfying @xmath556 , and in the case of type iii , @xmath557 and @xmath558 are distinct real numbers satisfying @xmath559 .",
    "then we have @xmath560 here we note that for the case of type ii , iii and iv the final point @xmath561 is included as a multiple point , where the multiplicity is 2 , 3 and 4 for the cases of type ii , iii and iv respectively .          under these homogeneous coordinates , for an algebraic subset @xmath570 , we denote by @xmath571 $ ] for the homogeneous ideal of @xmath572 .",
    "let @xmath573 be a quartic polynomial which defines a branch divisor of the anticanonical map @xmath14 as the intersection with the scroll @xmath134 .",
    "obviously @xmath25 is defined only up to polynomials in the ideal @xmath574 $ ] of the scroll .",
    "let @xmath575 be a defining polynomial of a quadric in @xmath16 containing all the double conics , whose existence was proved in proposition [ prop : q ] .",
    "let @xmath576 be a double curve on @xmath253 .",
    "then as @xmath577 as divisors on the plane @xmath578 , there exists a constant @xmath579 such that @xmath580 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath581 for some @xmath582 , we obtain @xmath583 .",
    "further the last ideal is readily seen to be equal to @xmath584 , and therefore equals to @xmath585 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath586 . but",
    "this means that the divisor @xmath587 contains @xmath93 , which contradicts @xmath588 ( and @xmath589 .",
    "therefore @xmath590 for any double conics @xmath591 and @xmath592 .",
    "next let @xmath569 be any double quartic curve . then since @xmath593",
    ", there exists a constant @xmath579 such that @xmath594 .",
    "so taking a difference with @xmath595 , we obtain that @xmath596 .",
    "but since @xmath597 , we have @xmath598 , and therefore @xmath599 . hence if @xmath600 we have @xmath601 , which means @xmath602 .",
    "since @xmath603 , this means that the divisor @xmath604 contains a line @xmath605 on the plane @xmath606 as an irreducible component , which again contradicts the irreducibility of @xmath607 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath608 for any double quartic curve @xmath591 .",
    "by rescaling we can suppose @xmath609 for any @xmath610 .",
    "thus we have @xmath611    now for the case of type i , by , we have @xmath612 so from we have @xmath613 but it is elementary to see that the right hand side of is equal to the ideal @xmath614 .",
    "this directly implies that the equation @xmath25 of the quartic hypersurface in @xmath16 is exactly as in in theorem [ thm : main ] .    for the case of type ii , in a similar way , using we obtain @xmath615 but clearly @xmath616 can be replaced by @xmath617 , which is equal to @xmath618 .",
    "then we can see that the right hand side of is equal to the ideal @xmath619 .",
    "this again implies in theorem [ thm : main ] .      it remains to show the final statement concerning reducibility of a conic . for this",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is not of type i and let @xmath569 be the ( unique ) splitting double conic ( see  ) .",
    "then from the table at the beginning of this proof , the equation of the plane @xmath623 is given by @xmath624 .",
    "therefore from  we have @xmath625 .",
    "since this is reducible , we obtain the assertion .",
