    "although no direct phenomenological data is available for hadronic physics at high temperature , monte carlo lattice simulations of pure yang - mills theory and qcd begin to unfold a consistent picture . in pure yang - mills theory , a phase transition occurs where the polyakov loop as order parameter signals the change from a confined to a deconfined phase .",
    "this corresponds to a change from the phase with unbroken center symmetry to the spontaneously broken phase .",
    "moreover , there is now ample evidence @xcite of nontrivial gluonic structure above @xmath1 which persists over a significant temperature range .",
    "the approach to the high temperature limit of a free gluon gas is rather slow , and even at very high temperatures standard perturbation theory has only met with limited success .    in this paper , we seek to gain some additional insight into this behaviour in pure su(2 ) gauge theory by exploiting those nonperturbative features which are analytically accessible in the modified axial gauge .",
    "recently , an effective action was derived by some of us @xcite for the situation in which one of the three space dimensions is compact ( at  finite extension \" ) . as a result of integrating out the gauge field variables which describe the phase of the polyakov loop",
    ", this effective action has two novel features : a mass term and antiperiodic boundary conditions in the finite spatial direction for charged gluons .",
    "the mass and changed boundary conditions are themselves non - perturbative and a consequence of the nontrivial jacobian in this gauge . in the same work ,",
    "the correspondence between this finite extension formulation and the analogue system in thermodynamic equilibrium at finite temperature was detailed .",
    "thus in the present work we shall use the terms  temperature \" and  extension \" interchangeably , with the following replacements understood , @xmath2 for temperature and inverse extension , and , respectively , @xmath3 for energy density and pressure .",
    "the most striking feature of the modified axial gauge is the fact that the center symmetry is realized in perturbation theory , implying an infinite free energy of a single static quark .",
    "concomitantly , the correlator of polyakov loops produces a linear potential . however , perturbation theory is clearly not adequate to describe the dynamics of confinement , so that for instance the value of the string tension is unrealistic .    to apply this formalism to the high temperature regime",
    "is nontrivial since a breakdown of the center symmetry has to occur .",
    "we can not cross the critical point by using only perturbative methods . if one can at all think about the high temperature phase in terms of boundary conditions and masses for otherwise weakly interacting gluons , it is clear that the boundary conditions of charged gluons can not remain antiperiodic above @xmath1 , but should , at least at very large @xmath4 , become periodic .",
    "a useful tool for gaining some insight beyond perturbation theory is that of background fields .",
    "one probes a given system with a specific external field and looks for regimes of stability respectively instability in the energy density , at a certain order in the fluctuations about this external field . for su(2 )",
    "yang - mills theory a simple , if crude , choice of background field is the savvidy ansatz consisting of a constant colour neutral chromomagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this ansatz itself has a long history at both zero and nonzero temperatures .",
    "indeed , various authors have tried to exploit the energy density or effective potential for a savvidy type external field in order to observe the deconfinement phase transition , by studying the change in the position of the minimum of the energy density .",
    "results , however , have been under dispute to date due to the varying degrees of _ ad hoc _",
    "measures used in these works . in the original ( zero temperature ) study of savvidy , the minimum of the energy density is driven away from the zero field limit by a quite specific mode ; the same mode however makes the potential imaginary at the local minimum that is finally established ( to one loop ) , so that this minimum is in turn unstable . at finite temperature for the standard yang - mills action ,",
    "the unstable mode persists : a number of authors @xcite have simply cut this mode out and obtained a nontrivial minimum at low temperature which becomes a minimum at zero field for high temperature .",
    "this was then interpreted as a signal of the deconfinement phase transition . however , as demonstrated in @xcite , even with quarks once the unstable mode is put back in , at high temperature the instability persists : there is no temperature at which a stable minimum to the one loop energy density at zero field develops in the background field gauge . in another approach @xcite , and one",
    "quite similar to ours , this effective potential has been studied by treating the boundary conditions of charged gluons as a variational parameter . for any nonperiodic choice of boundary conditions , the corresponding shift in the lowest matsubara frequency",
    "is found to make the theory stable at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "however , with the change in boundary conditions in the field dependent part only , these results are hard to interpret physically",
    ".    our strategy will be as follows .",
    "after reviewing the key results of @xcite , we shall study the z@xmath5 symmetric phase , that is the phase with the center symmetry realized , of the su(2 ) yang - mills theory via its response to an external magnetic field of the savvidy type . to this end , we shall compute the energy density in zeta - function regularization @xcite for su(2 ) gluons in the presence of the savvidy background field .",
    "for later generalization we perform this calculation for arbitrary mass and boundary conditions of the charged gluons . with the  canonical \" masses and boundary conditions as derived in the modified axial gauge theory in @xcite , the only minima in the energy density that appear are at zero external field , but for sufficiently high temperature these minima are stable .",
    "the z@xmath5 symmetric , perturbative phase is however not and can not be the correct high temperature phase of the su(2 ) yang - mills theory . if antiperiodic boundary conditions persisted beyond the",
    " critical \" point , dimensional reduction would leave a @xmath6 dimensional maxwell theory rather than the non - abelian theory that is seen in lattice computations . furthermore , for sufficiently high temperatures where we do not expect significant non - perturbative dynamics , the thermodynamic instability of the z@xmath5 symmetric phase becomes an important issue .",
    "we therefore will study in the final part the consequences of magnetic and thermodynamic stability relevant for the high temperature phase . allowing for variations in mass and boundary conditions",
    ", it will be possible to simultaneously satisfy both stability requirements . as displayed in a discussion of the high temperature properties of the system , the resulting phenomenological description shares , qualitatively , important characteristics with finite temperature lattice gauge theory .",
    "at finite extension or temperature , one space - time direction is singled out ; hence , an axial type of gauge is particularly convenient . to be specific",
    ", we choose the 3-direction as the compact direction ( @xmath7 $ ] ) and work in minkowski space .",
    "all our results can equally well be reinterpreted in terms of finite temperature equilibrium thermodynamics if desired , by going to euclidean space and exploiting covariance .",
    "the other space - time directions will be denoted by @xmath8 and referred to as  transverse \" .",
    "as is well known , periodic boundary conditions imposed on gauge fields in the 3-direction do not permit complete elimination of @xmath9 ; a gauge invariant zero mode has to be retained .",
    "more precisely , this 3-dimensional residual field corresponds to the eigenphases of the field @xmath10 , the trace of which can be identified with the polyakov loop , @xmath11 .",
    "we thus demand only the weaker ,  modified \" axial gauge condition @xmath12 , which can be supplemented by a diagonalization in color space , @xmath13 . for simplicity , we denote @xmath14 as @xmath15 in the following .",
    "the polyakov loop is then given by @xmath16 showing that in the modified axial gauge this important variable appears as an elementary rather than composite field .",
    "the presence of the three dimensional field @xmath17 indicates the necessity for a further gauge fixing .",
    "indeed , gauge ambiguities are still present in the sector of transverse ( @xmath18 ) , neutral , @xmath19 independent gauge fields . due to their abelian nature",
    ", these ambiguities can easily be resolved by adding a standard gauge fixing term to the lagrangian .",

    "the corresponding part of the haar measure enters with a finite range of integration . in the canonical formulation ,",
    "this faddeev - popov determinant arises as a jacobian modifying the kinetic energy of the polyakov loop variables @xmath26 @xcite . in qed the same procedure",
    "yields the standard flat measure for @xmath26 .",
    "the finite range of integration for @xmath15 in the above functional integral precludes a conventional perturbative treatment , since the quadratic part of the action does not yield a gaussian integral . here , we follow the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which amounts to integrating out @xmath15 completely prior to any perturbative expansion .",
    "first , we regulate the functional integral by a transverse lattice ( lattice constant @xmath27 ) .",
    "subsequently , the variable @xmath15 is shifted to @xmath28 . as a consequence , the @xmath29 factor in the measure ( [ fe8 ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath30 , and the integration limits become @xmath31 $ ] . in order to preserve the standard form of the minimal coupling of charged gluon fields to @xmath32 , it is advantageous to redefine these fields as follows , @xmath33 this does not change the physics , but yields new charged gluon fields which , in contradistinction to the neutral ones , obey antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the fact that one can integrate out @xmath15 completely rests on the following observation : as a consequence of the finite range of integrations , the field @xmath15 ( and hence the polyakov loop ) becomes  ultralocal \" ; it does not propagate in the continuum limit @xcite . in lattice terminology",
    ", one finds that hopping terms are suppressed by factors @xmath34 .",
    "since the coupling constant is expected to  run \" with @xmath27 in the standard logarithmic manner ( as will indeed be confirmed below in the present framework ) and @xmath35 is a macroscopic length , this factor goes to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "formally , ultralocality of the polyakov loop field @xmath36 means that it can be completely integrated out . introducing a lattice regularization in the transverse directions in order to define the functional integral over this field",
    ", one arrives at finite non - gaussian integrals which can be explicitly carried out .",
    "no ultraviolet divergent expressions occur in this subsector of the theory , so that the lattice regulator can be safely taken to zero , leaving an effective action for the remaining degrees of freedom ( @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 = s_{\\rm ym } \\left[a_{\\alpha } , a_{3}=0\\right ] + s_{\\rm gf } \\left[a_{\\alpha}^{3}\\right ] +   \\frac{m_3 ^ 2}{2 } \\sum_{a=1,2 }   \\int d^{4}x a^{a}_{\\alpha } \\left(x\\right )   a^{a,\\alpha } \\left(x\\right ) .",
    "\\label{fe11}\\ ] ] in this effective action , the polyakov loop variable has left its signature in the  geometrical \" mass term of the charged gluons @xmath39 and in the change to antiperiodic boundary conditions @xmath40 while the neutral gluons @xmath41 remain massless and periodic .",
    "the antiperiodic boundary conditions are a consequence of the mean value of the polyakov loop variable , the geometrical mass comes from its fluctuations .",
    "notice that both of these changes in the action are independent of the coupling constant . in @xcite ,",
    "the center symmetry and a properly redefined order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition in this effective theory are discussed in detail .",
    "here we only recall that the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath42 vanishes in zeroeth order perturbation theory , indicating that this formulation is particularly well suited for describing the z@xmath5-symmetric phase .",
    "having reviewed the essential aspects of @xcite it is useful to look at this effective theory in a wider context .",
    "the fact that the polyakov loops are indicating confinement of static quarks means that we have a natural formalism for dealing with finite temperature gauge theories which are still in the confined phase . as the temperature",
    "is increased , one knows from lattice calculations that a phase transition to a deconfined phase happens at a certain critical temperature @xmath1 ; correspondingly , the polyakov loop order parameter acquires a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "we can not expect to be able to treat this transition perturbatively .",
    "however , we can try to extrapolate our findings into the deconfined phase .",
    "if there exists a similarly adequate kind of perturbation theory for the broken phase where gluons can be treated as weakly interacting , it should not involve antiperiodic boundary conditions , but rather quasi - periodic ones which approach periodic boundary conditions in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "this is just another way of phrasing the fact that polyakov loops acquire an expectation value in the deconfined phase .",
    "indeed , a theory of essentially free gluons with antiperiodic boundary conditions for very high temperatures can be ruled out on the grounds of dimensional reduction : in the limit @xmath44 for any choice of boundary conditions other than periodic , charged gluons , exhibiting a gap in their single particle spectra , would decouple and the resulting dimensionally reduced theory would not be three - dimensional yang - mills theory but rather maxwell theory , in conflict with lattice results .",
    "another argument comes from the sign of the casimir pressure , which for antiperiodic boundary conditions would signal thermodynamic instability at high temperature , an unacceptable result .",
    "finally , above the critical temperature the effective mass of charged gluons can not increase forever linearly with temperature , both from dimensional reduction arguments and in order that the stefan - boltzmann law can be truly restored at very high temperatures .    to summarize , nontrivial boundary conditions , a ( magnetic ) gluon mass and the realization of center symmetry at finite temperature are the basic non - perturbative features brought about by gauge fixing in our formalism .",
    "now , as the temperature is increased a phase transition to the broken phase must occur . at this point , evidently the boundary condition angle and",
    "the gluon mass must change .",
    "the physics associated with this change is computationally difficult to describe in our approach , but nonetheless this change in the values of these parameters will not be immediate : namely nontrivial values should persist above the phase transition .",
    "the simplest way then to characterize the symmetry broken phase is to use these parameters , though now allowing them to take values other than those determined above .",
    "the requirement of stability combined with the demand that the stefan - boltzmann law be approached at high temperatures can enable us to study the behaviour of these parameters in the very high temperature regime .",
    "we thus have variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 associated with charged gluons in the effective theory of @xcite .",
    "the first quantity describes the angle in the boundary condition @xmath47 with @xmath48 , the second the mass of these gluons . in terms of these parameters",
    "we calculate the energy density for an external magnetic field of the savvidy type .",
    "we shall then set these parameters to their values @xmath49 for charged gluons , @xmath50 for neutral gluons , which characterize the @xmath0-symmetric phase , and investigate the stability problem . in the next step",
    ", we shall treat these parameters in a less restrictive fashion in order to explore the high temperature phase .",
    "in the above formalism where the redundant variables have been eliminated , we proceed to study the stability properties of the effective theory of eq .",
    "( [ fe11 ] ) by probing it with a background magnetic field .",
    "we choose a homogeneous external chromomagnetic field in color 3-direction , with the potential of the form @xmath51 although this looks identical to savvidy s choice @xcite at first glance , we should like to point out an important difference .",
    "traditionally , the background field has been introduced before gauge fixing . in this context",
    ", the choice of the background field to be diagonal has no physical meaning . in our case",
    "however , the 3-direction has already been specified by diagonalizing the polyakov loop variables .",
    "what we investigate then is the stability of the vacuum against homogeneous magnetic field fluctuations which point in the same direction in color space as the polyakov loop .",
    "the energy density in the presence of the external field is the sum over the single particle energies .",
    "since we can not use the popular background gauge , we must solve the landau level problem in the axial gauge ; some details of the calculation can be found in the appendix . clearly , the neutral gluons contribute only to the casimir ( @xmath52 independent ) part of the energy density , which will be included later .",
    "we thus here restrict ourselves to the charged gluon contributions .",
    "the expressions at this point are ultraviolet divergent and in need of regularization which will be done here by zeta - function methods . in this scheme",

    "thus , anticipating the final section , it is plausible to assume that in the broken phase this stability will persist .",
    "above , we have focussed on the sign change of the @xmath88 contribution to the renormalized energy density , i.e. , the weak field aspect .",
    "our calculation shares with previous investigations the disease that above a certain critical magnetic field , the energy density develops an imaginary part . in fact",

    "the value of the critical magnetic field can easily be understood : this is nothing but the point at which the mass gap ( due to the mass and nonzero lowest matsubara mode ) is completely compensated for by the magnetic field ( the lowest landau level of the @xmath94 gluon reaches zero , see eq .",
    "( [ regularenergy ] ) ) .",
    "this kind of instability at large magnetic fields is more problematic than the one at weak fields , since we can not trust the one loop calculation anymore .",
    "clearly , at the critical magnetic field , a restructuring of the vacuum must take place since the gluons in the lowest landau level can condense . here",
    ", we have made no attempt to treat these particular modes non - perturbatively and therefore can not handle this kind of instability .",
    "one interesting aspect however is worth mentioning , which is specific for our approach : as elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the polyakov loop correlator is dominated at large distance by the closest singularity in momentum space , i.e. the threshold for producing two charged gluons . on the other hand ,",
    "it is related to the potential between static fundamental sources . on the basis of the landau orbits",
    ", we can immediately predict that the  string tension \" will go like @xmath95 with @xmath96 coming from the combination of the mass term and the lowest matsubara mode .",
    "at the cusp , the string tension vanishes ; this opens the possibility for exploring the center symmetry breaking as a function of a parameter other than the temperature , namely the strength of the background field .",
    "we refrain from doing this here since it would require a better dynamical treatment of those modes which might condense .",
    "we appear to have arrived at a partly satisfactory description of the response of the z@xmath5 symmetric yang - mills phase to a homogeneous magnetic field at some intermediate temperature . as emphasized above , extension towards high temperatures",
    "is problematic .",
    "although increasing the temperature improves the stability with respect to magnetic field fluctuations , the thermodynamic instability now becomes an important issue .",
    "criteria of thermodynamic stability generally imply second order derivatives of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we expect at sufficiently high temperature a gas of gluons in a regime where the stefan - boltzmann law is approximately satisfied , namely the @xmath97 dependence of energy density or pressure is dominant .",
    "thus our simplified criterion for stability will be _ positive pressure _ for thermodynamics , or equivalently _ negative energy density _ for finite extension .",
    "now , the requirements of stability against magnetic field formation and thermodynamic stability are to some extent in conflict . roughly speaking , magnetic ( thermodynamic ) stability demands large ( small ) values of the  infrared parameters \" @xmath98 .",
    "it is thus of interest to discuss the consequences of the combined constraints of magnetic and thermodynamic stability .",
    "this study will be performed by considering variations in the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath45 in order to achieve simultaneously stability with respect to both thermal and magnetic field fluctuations . to allow for variations in these parameters",
    "is clearly appropriate for a description of the high temperature phase . at temperatures or extensions beyond the confinement - deconfinement transition with the center symmetry spontaneously broken ,",
    "the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath45 must deviate from their canonical values characteristic for the z@xmath5 symmetric phase .",
    "the aim of our studies is to display the consequences of the stability rather than to attempt a fit to lattice results for the high temperature phase .",
    "we will not allow for simultaneous parameter changes , but identify one of the two parameters with its infinite temperature limit ( @xmath99 or @xmath100 ) .",
    "in the first place , we shall assume massless charged gluons with @xmath35-dependent angle @xmath45 ( quasi - periodic gluons ) ; then , we shall keep the boundary conditions of the charged gluons periodic but allow for a more general @xmath35-dependence of their mass ( massive gluons ) .",
    "here we assume @xmath101 to be negligible .",
    "we first consider the requirement of thermodynamic stability .",
    "the casimir energy density for the massless charged gluons with quasi - periodic boundary conditions can be deduced from eq .",

    "this has been done in fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath67 and @xmath118 are normalized to the stefan - boltzmann values @xmath119 and the contribution from neutral gluons ( which we assume to obey periodic boundary conditions ) has been added .",
    "we first note that we can not perform such a calculation at temperatures below @xmath120 , simply because eq .",
    "( [ m9 ] ) ceases to have a solution ( the right hand side is bounded from above ) . at low temperatures in fig .",
    "3 , we observe the onset of thermodynamic instability where the pressure changes sign ( or the casimir effect changes from attraction to repulsion ) because @xmath45 crosses the value 1.51 , see eq .",
    "( [ m14a ] ) . the most conspicuous feature of fig .",
    "3 is however the slow , logarithmic approach to the stefan - boltzmann limit , reminiscent of the lattice data @xcite but quantitatively farther away from this limit in the covered temperature region .",
    "a rather sensitive measure for interaction effects is the quantity @xmath121 , which is of interest also in view of its direct relation to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and the gluon condensate @xcite .",
    "although our predicted temperature dependence is too rapid , this difference has the right order of magnitude as compared to the lattice data of @xcite as illustrated in fig .",

    "it is remarkable that this coincides with both theoretical expectations and lattice results for the temperature dependence of the gluon magnetic mass ; thus for instance , a recent determination in the landau gauge in a wide temperature range @xcite has been fitted with the formula @xmath131 surprisingly close to ( but larger than ) our lower bound from magnetic stability , eq .",
    "( [ m19 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that we have obtained eq .",

    "this is obviously a result from not calculating @xmath46 directly , but inferring it indirectly from magnetic stability considerations .",
    "we can again estimate thermodynamic functions by inserting the critical mass into the expressions for the casimir effect above , eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) .",
    "the important feature here is that the gluon mass rises more slowly than linearly with temperature .",
    "this is highly welcome , since it guarantees that we will asymptotically recover stefan - boltzmann behaviour of an ideal gluon gas .",
    "since on the other hand , magnetic stability does not permit a mass growing more slowly than with @xmath132 , these restrictions leave very little room for a different behaviour .",
    "in contrast to the massless case with @xmath4-dependent boundary conditions ( quasi - periodic gluons ) , we now need one subtraction to get a finite result , see eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) .",
    "this reduces somewhat the predictive power of the approach based on massive gluons . nevertheless , encouraged by the reasonable @xmath4-dependence of the gluon mass ,",
    "we proceed , adjusting the energy density at one reference length @xmath133 . after this subtraction",
    ", we have to evaluate the casimir energy density for charged gluons @xmath134 where @xmath135 . as a sample calculation ,",
    "we set @xmath136 equal to a certain fraction of the stefan - boltzmann value ( 0.8 ) at the highest temperature ; this value has been selected since it is consistent with the reduction of @xmath137 at @xmath138 reported in the su(2 ) lattice calculation of @xcite .",
    "the pressure is evaluated by numerical differentiation , see eq .",
    "( [ m7 ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "6 where a massless neutral gluon contribution has been added , since our formalism gives no hint to modifications in the neutral sector .",
    "while different in detail , this particular calculation leads qualitatively to a picture similar to the one with quasi - periodic gluons shown in fig .",
    "once again we observe the slow ( logarithmic ) approach to the stefan - boltzmann limit as @xmath115 .",
    "we have also calculated the interaction measure @xmath121 in the region where lattice data @xcite are available and included it into fig .",
    "4 ( curve labelled  @xmath46 \" ) to test the sensitivity of these calculations to details . the same renormalization condition as in fig . 6 has been used here .",
    "it is tempting to use the function @xmath139 derived from the condition of magnetic stability also to improve other perturbative predictions .",
    "one key quantity in hot gauge theories is the debye screening mass , related to the zero momentum limit of the vacuum polarization tensor @xmath140 .",
    "standard ( finite extension ) perturbation theory in the axial gauge gives for @xmath141 the lowest order expression @xmath142 where the gluon loop and tadpole are included and dimensional regularization has been used to perform the 3-dimensional integrations . in the limit @xmath143 and",
    "evaluating the divergent sum with zeta function methods , we find @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "incidentally , this result can be checked easily by taking the second derivative of @xmath67 , eq .",
    "( [ m13 ] ) , with respect to @xmath45 . with the special case of periodic boundary conditions and replacing @xmath35 by @xmath117",

    "( [ m15b ] ) changes the temperature dependence of @xmath148 significantly . over a wide range of temperatures ,",
    "we observe a compensation between the decrease due to the running coupling constant and the increase due to the restoration of periodic boundary conditions ; see fig .",
    "7 ( curve labelled ",
    "@xmath45 \" ) .",
    "the resulting debye mass has a linear @xmath4-dependence , @xmath149 , to very good accuracy from @xmath150 up to @xmath4 much larger than 16@xmath75 shown in the plot .",
    "this temperature dependence is consistent with the flat behaviour observed in the lattice calculation @xcite , although the prefactor there was found to be significantly larger than ours , @xmath151 .",
    "very recently , a new lattice calculation @xcite reported somewhat smaller values of @xmath148 in this temperature region .",
    "however , for extremely high temperatures ( up to @xmath152 ) , the logarithmic running was observed , although with a coefficient significantly larger than the naive perturbative expectation .    in the other case where the magnetic gluon mass @xmath46 serves to stabilize the system",
    ", we can go through similar considerations . using zeta - function regularization , @xmath153 in the massive gluon case",
    "can be treated along similar lines as the casimir energy density .",
    "a subtraction of @xmath154 at a certain @xmath133 is necessary to get a finite answer .",
    "we find ( in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ m21 ] ) ) @xmath155 if we now adjust @xmath156 to a reasonable value , we obtain a behaviour similar to that for quasi - periodic gluons , namely a striking plateau in @xmath157 up to high @xmath4 ( fig . 7 , curve labelled  @xmath46 \" ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it does not seem possible to remove the discrepancy in the absolute value of a factor of 2 with the lattice data @xcite by simply adjusting our electric mass to a higher value at one temperature ; if we were to do this , the curve for @xmath148 would approach the asymptotic limit from above , and the flat behaviour of @xmath157 would be destroyed .",
    "thus we can not reconcile absolute value and @xmath4-dependence of the debye screening mass better than to the shown qualitative level .",
    "in summary , we have probed su(2 ) yang - mills theory at finite extension by means of a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "technically , our study differs in two important respects from previous works devoted to this topic : on the technical side , we have worked in a completely gauge fixed framework from the outset , the modified axial gauge .",
    "the gauge fixed theory exhibits certain non - perturbative ingredients like a mass and boundary condition angle for charged gluons in the z@xmath5-symmetric ( confined ) phase .",
    "> from the physics point of view , our investigations focussed then on the interplay between magnetic and thermodynamic stability .",
    "the calculation then proceeded in a straightforward way , by evaluation of the energy density to one loop order ( we prefer the casimir ground state to a system in thermodynamical equilibrium , but the two are equivalent ) .",
    "a tachyonic instability at low temperature against large fields indeed appeared in our calculation , but because this is in a regime where the one - loop calculation can not anyway be trusted , this was not relevant for the analysis we subsequently carried out . indeed , unlike in standard background gauge computations @xcite , in our gauge - fixed formulation of the z@xmath5 symmetric phase with antiperiodic boundary conditions and the mass @xmath158 for charged gluons , we obtained stability against weak field magnetic fluctuations below a certain extension or , equivalently , above a certain temperature .",
    "this temperature was found to be approximately one - third the confinement - deconfinement transition temperature @xmath1 as determined by lattice gauge calculations .",
    "the fact that our calculation achieved stability already before the actual transition to the @xmath0-broken phase gave us some confidence in extrapolating our formalism into this broken phase .",
    "to use our formulation there we made one assumption : that above the phase transition the fundamental nonperturbative quantities remain the mass and boundary condition angle of the charged gluons .",
    "in the course of the phase transition , their values should , naturally , change and of course we can not predict how they should change .",
    "however a complete change to periodic boundary conditions and massless gluons at the critical point is not possible because it would lead to magnetic instability . on the other hand , at sufficiently high temperatures our one loop computation , with these minimal nonperturbative modifications , should become more reliable .",
    "we have determined the value of the mass , or the boundary condition angle , which satisfies in a minimal way the condition of magnetic stability .",
    "these bounds were in turn reinserted into various thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we obtained features which are stongly reminiscent of results of lattice calculations , but which have thus far resisted any kind of perturbative understanding .",
    "specifically , we found that the slow approach of pressure and energy density to the stefan - boltzmann limit , seen in lattice results @xcite , within our treatment seems quite unavoidable .",
    "even more surprising is our success in reproducing the linear @xmath159 rather than @xmath160 dependence for the electric screening mass seen by @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that all these results do not depend sensitively on the details of the calculation , as is best seen by comparing the massive gluon calculations with those based on quasi - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "as mentioned at the outset , the specific choice of the savvidy magnetic field in the gauge - fixed formulation we have pursued in this work has quite a different meaning to that in background field calculations . because the choice of gauge has fixed both the choice of the diagonal color direction and the orientation of the @xmath161-axis in space , each possible choice of the colour and spatial orientation of the external field represents physically different cases .",
    "a natural extension of this work then is to perform similar calculations for such different orientations of the chromomagnetic field , both in internal and in lorentz space .",
    "this program is nothing less than the mapping out of the physical directions of the effective potential .",
    "similarly , it would be interesting to study , in this gauge - fixed formalism , radically different external fields , such as self - dual fields @xcite , which would include both magnetic and electric fields , or stochastic @xcite fields .",
    "work in these direction is in progress .",
