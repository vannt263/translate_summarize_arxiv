    "low - energy supersymmetry provides us with one of the most attractive candidates for the fundamental theory beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "however supersymmetry must be a broken symmetry below the electroweak scale due to the absence of any experimental signatures .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is expressed by soft terms which do not reintroduce quadratic divergences  @xcite and spoil the planck / weak scale hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "these soft breaking terms consist of gaugino masses , scalar masses , and scalar trilinear couplings .",
    "generic forms of soft breaking terms lead to new contributions and sometimes disastrous phenomenological effects to flavor - changing rare processes  @xcite as well as to cp violation  @xcite . to satisfy the experimental constraints and to make supersymmetric models viable ,",
    "supersymmetry - breaking terms are forced to have special properties , which could be realized in various ways proposed in the literature .    in the context of supergravity and superstring theory",
    ", there exists the gravitino , namely , the supersymmetric partner of the graviton .",
    "it interacts with all particle species through tiny planck - suppressed couplings and may be hard to be observed in collider experiments ( see , however ,  @xcite . )  on the other hand , the gravitino is too easily `` detected '' in a cosmological sense and , in turn , that leads to severe constraints on its property in almost all supersymmetric theories  @xcite .",
    "this gravitino problem exists even in the inflationary universe .",
    "if the gravitino is stable , its relic abundance has to be small not to contribute too much to the energy density of the universe  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved either if the gravitino mass is sufficiently light  @xcite , or if the reheating temperature of the inflation is low enough to suppress the regeneration of gravitinos in the thermal bath  @xcite . for an unstable gravitino ,",
    "the most severe constraint comes from the big - bang nucleosynthesis . if gravitinos decay with electromagnetic and/or hadronic showers during or after the nucleosynthesis epoch , the decay products would spoil the successful predictions of the big - bang nucleosynthesis by destroying synthesized light elements  @xcite .",
    "this argument puts a severe constraint on the gravitino abundance , which may be suppressed by invoking the inflation with sufficiently low reheating temperature .",
    "the constraint becomes relaxed and eventually disappears as the gravitino mass increases and it decays earlier . a heavy gravitino with mass of order 10  tev can",
    "therefore greatly ameliorate the problem .",
    "supersymmetric theories also include particles with masses around the electroweak scale and with suppressed couplings to ordinary matter .",
    "they are generally called moduli fields , the existence of which may be related to the degeneracy of vacua parameterized by symmetries in high - energy theory . therefore the moduli potential is flat in perturbation theory and only lifted by non - perturbative effects or supersymmetry breaking , which induces masses of moduli fields around the supersymmetry - breaking scale .",
    "it is known that the existence of moduli leads to serious cosmological difficulties  @xcite with their suppressed couplings and resultant long lifetime .",
    "moduli fields start to oscillate when the expansion rate of the universe becomes smaller than moduli masses . the coherent oscillations decay into ordinary particles after the nucleosynthesis occurred for moduli masses around the electroweak scale . with",
    "a natural value of the initial amplitude of moduli , induced huge entropy destroys the great success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis as a heavy gravitino does .",
    "this is the cosmological moduli problem .",
    "a simple and attractive way to evade the problem is to make all moduli sufficiently heavy so that the moduli decay before the nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "the masses of moduli fields might naively be expected to be of the same order of other supersymmetry - breaking mass parameters , especially a similar order to the gravitino mass as in the hidden sector models .",
    "however there could be some hierarchy between them , crucially depending on the form of moduli potential which originates from supersymmetry - breaking dynamics . in these ways",
    ", cosmological arguments may be strong enough to discriminate dynamics of supersymmetry breaking .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the physics of moduli fields in the heavy gravitino scenario , i.e.  with supersymmetry - breaking scale higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "this may be rather a common situation in supersymmetric theories , including supergravity and superstring theory .",
    "the only few exceptions include , e.g.  supersymmetry breaking with strongly - coupled gauge dynamics in a low - energy regime  @xcite .",
    "the heavy gravitino generally implies that moduli fields also have their masses around the gravitino mass scale , and therefore the cosmological gravitino / moduli problems may be solved by making these fields sufficiently heavy . as mentioned above",
    ", the masses of moduli fields crucially depend on their potential form , which is supposed to arise from ( non - perturbative ) dynamics of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "there have been various proposals for potential forms derived from specific non - trivial dynamics in high - energy theory .",
    "a well - known example is for the dilaton modulus field in string - inspired theories , which modulus is stabilized by ( multiple ) gaugino condensations  @xcite , non - perturbative corrections to khler terms  @xcite , and so on .",
    "recent development of the flux compactifications in type iib superstring theory reveals another possibility , in which the dilaton is fixed in the presence of fluxes , and the moduli stabilization can be achieved by some additional non - perturbative effects  @xcite .",
    "patterns of supersymmetry breaking by minimizing scalar potential have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we pursue , in a way , an opposite approach in that the possible form of moduli potential is highly constrained from a phenomenological viewpoint without referring to any specific dynamics at high - energy regime . for that purpose , it is a key ingredient to take into account the supersymmetry - breaking effects associated with the superconformal anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the soft mass parameters from the anomaly mediation are loop suppressed ( because of being related to quantum anomalies ) relative to the gravitino mass . it should be noted that this anomaly - mediated contribution ubiquitously exists in all scenarios of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "such unavoidable anomaly effects can not be neglected in the heavy gravitino models and may provide significant corrections to observable quantities measured at high accuracy  @xcite . among them ,",
    "the violation of cp invariance is one of the most notable quantities , including the electric dipole moments of nucleons , atoms , and charged leptons .",
    "the experimental results indicate that complex phases of soft mass parameters are tightly constrained so that supersymmetric contributions to cp - violating observables do not exceed the predictions of the standard model . on the basis of such phenomenological results",
    ", we will find in section ii that the superpotential of moduli fields which participate in supersymmetry breaking is uniquely determined ( up to a khler transformation ) by requiring cp be automatically conserved .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the possible form of a moduli potential is completely fixed irrespectively of the stabilization and specific dynamics of moduli fields .",
    "interestingly enough , we will see in section iii that the obtained potential , however , does stabilize the moduli and also cause supersymmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore the superpotential has its origin in ordinary field theory and superstring theory .",
    "in particular , it has recently been shown  @xcite that some classes of superstring compactification in the presence of non - trivial fluxes generate the above - mentioned superpotential for khler moduli fields .",
    "it may be a surprising result that two completely different perspectives , a top - down one from string theory and a bottom - up one from experimental observations , derive the same and unique form of moduli potential .",
    "it is found in section iv that the mass spectrum in the model with the uniquely - determined superpotential exhibits two interesting types of small hierarchies among superparticles , gravitino , and moduli fields .",
    "the lightest particles are gauginos and scalar partners of quarks and leptons with masses around the electroweak or tev scale .",
    "these mass scales are suppressed roughly by one - loop factors compared to the gravitino mass due to the loop - suppressed contribution of the anomaly mediation .",
    "this first hierarchy is favorable for solving the gravitino problem as stated above .",
    "the heaviest states are moduli whose masses are o(10 ) times that of the gravitino .",
    "this second hierarchical factor is roughly determined by the logarithm of the ratio between the planck and electroweak scales .",
    "that is naturally obtained by minimizing the uniquely determined moduli potential .",
    "since the moduli become heavy in the vacuum , they have suppressed contributions to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we find that the anomaly and moduli mediations induce numerically similar sizes of soft mass parameters for visible - sector superpartners , which are of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "it is noted that , as mentioned above , our analysis covers a mass spectrum derived from some superstring theory in flux compactifications .",
    "the problem of the tachyonic slepton , which is a serious problem in the model of pure anomaly mediation , is ameliorated .",
    "more interestingly , our scenario predicts the lightest neutralino with a significant composition of higgsinos as the lightest supersymmetric particle in a wide range of parameter space .",
    "together with this issue , we study in section v new cosmological implications of our model with heavy moduli fields .",
    "the dynamics of gravitino and moduli fields is described by @xmath0 four - dimensional supergravity .",
    "the gauge - invariant lagrangian , in particular the scalar potential , is most simply written down with the compensator formalism of supergravity  @xcite .",
    "larger gauge symmetries make the theory easily analyzed , and the usual poincar supergravity is obtained by fixing redundant conformal / poincar local gauge symmetries .",
    "let us consider a single chiral superfield @xmath1 , for simplicity , but it is straightforward to include multiple superfields in the lagrangian .",
    "the most general supergravity lagrangian is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the determinant of the vierbein field and the reduced planck mass is set to unity .",
    "we use as usual the same notation @xmath1 for a chiral superfield , scalar component , and its vacuum expectation value .",
    "@xmath4 is the superpotential of @xmath1 , and @xmath5 the supergravity @xmath5 function which is related to the khler potential @xmath6 in the einstein frame @xmath7 the symbols @xmath8 and @xmath9 mean the uses of @xmath10- and @xmath11-type action formulas of superconformal tensor calculus .",
    "the chiral superfield @xmath12 is the conformal compensator multiplet and its value is fixed by the part of superconformal gauge transformation such as dilatation so that @xmath13 . in the discussion",
    "below , we assume the flat gravitational background and will drop @xmath3 from the action .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) contains the following terms of auxiliary @xmath11 components @xmath14 the lower indices of @xmath5 and @xmath15 denote the field derivatives .",
    "the equations of motion are thus given by @xmath16 substituting these equations back into ( [ laux ] ) , one obtains the scalar potential of the @xmath0 four - dimensional supergravity @xmath17\\ ] ] in the conformal frame .",
    "the canonical potential in the einstein frame is easily obtained by field - dependent weyl rescaling .",
    "assuming that the vacuum expectation value of the scalar potential vanishes , a location of the potential minimum is unchanged by this weyl rescaling , and thus we will use the conformal frame in most of the subsequent discussions .    as seen from the above formulation ,",
    "there are two types of supersymmetry - breaking @xmath11 terms .",
    "one is the chiral superfield @xmath11 component @xmath18 , where @xmath1 participates in supersymmetry breaking with a non - vanishing @xmath18 .",
    "another is the compensator contribution @xmath19 that should be taken into account in any supersymmetry - breaking scenario . in particular , since @xmath19 gives a gravitino mass scale , its contribution to other superparticles is important in the heavy gravitino scenario . in the present work , that will play a key role to determine the potential form of moduli fields .    in the superconformal framework ,",
    "the lagrangian of vector multiplets , especially for gaugino masses , includes the gauge kinetic function @xmath20 , @xmath21 at the classical level , the compensator @xmath12 does not appear in the gauge kinetic term as the gauge chiral superfield @xmath22 has a chiral weight @xmath23 .",
    "it turns out that the dependence of @xmath12 comes out radiatively through the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the renormalization scale ) . in this paper",
    ", we take for simplicity @xmath26 by holomorphic field redefinition .",
    "note however that this choice does not necessarily means @xmath1 is a dilaton in the four - dimensional supergravity , whose vacuum expectation value determines the gauge coupling constant @xmath27 .",
    "one may instead suppose , e.g.  @xmath28 , but there are only quantitative difference between these two forms of gauge kinetic function . in particular , the following analysis of potential forms of moduli is completely unchanged .",
    "a gaugino receives two types of supersymmetry - breaking mass from the lagrangian ( [ lv ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the effect of the compensator multiplet appears only through the renormalization and induces gaugino masses which are determined by super weyl anomaly .",
    "the total gaugino mass @xmath29 in the canonically normalized basis is found @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gauge beta function ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we have defined the real part of @xmath1 as @xmath33 .",
    "gaugino masses given above are evaluated at a high - energy scale .",
    "here we simply neglect threshold corrections from high - energy theory .",
    "when only the moduli- and anomaly - mediated contributions are taken into account , higher - order corrections and threshold effects do not disturb the discussion about complex phases of @xmath29 .",
    "these corrections just modify the mass spectrum slightly .",
    "we would like to investigate the dynamics of moduli fields . as can be seen in ( [ l ] ) , that is determined by two functions of the moduli field @xmath1 ; khler potential @xmath34 and superpotential @xmath4 .",
    "we first note that the assumption that @xmath1 is a modulus gives a constraint on its khler potential .",
    "the existence of moduli fields may be related to the degeneracy of vacua which are parameterized by symmetries of theory",
    ". then imaginary parts of moduli fields often transform non - linearly under these flavor symmetries which dictate the moduli khler potential in low - energy effective theory as @xmath35 with a real function @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that this shift symmetry would be broken only to an extent that it does not induce any observable effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the moduli superpotential @xmath4 is not allowed by the shift symmetry as it should be , and may be generated due to symmetry - breaking effects in effective theory .",
    "thus , moduli superpotential does not generally have any restrictions and its promising forms have been discussed in model - dependent ways so as to stabilize moduli expectation values , to have moduli supersymmetry breaking , etc",
    ". we will show below that , in the heavy gravitino scenario , a possible form of moduli superpotential can be determined model - independently and also without taking any particular assumption of the moduli khler potential ( [ kahler ] ) .    to this end , it is important to notice that there are two types of supersymmetry - breaking masses of gauginos ( [ gauginomass ] ) . in the heavy gravitino scenario ,",
    "these two contributions may be comparable in size to each other .",
    "therefore their relative phase value gives rise to sizable complex phases of gaugino masses .",
    "if there is only one gaugino in the theory , its mass can be made real with @xmath36 rotation .",
    "however , realistic models such as supersymmetric standard models may contain multiple gauge factors . in this case , phases of gaugino masses are generally not aligned because the anomaly mediated contributions ( @xmath19 terms ) are proportional to gauge beta functions which are diverse from each other .",
    "consequently , all but one gaugino mass phase can not be rotated away from the lagrangian and remain physical observables .",
    "is the only global symmetry under which phases of gaugino masses are shifted .",
    "this is because of the theorem  @xcite saying that massless vector fields can not couple to any lorentz - covariant currents .",
    "thus gauginos can only couple to the symmetries which do not commute with supersymmetry . ]",
    "it is easily found that the situation is not improved even if the standard gauge groups are embedded into a unified gauge group in a high - energy regime .",
    "this is because anomaly mediated contributions are determined only by low - energy quantities and decouple from high - energy physics . in other words , threshold effects at the unification scale split the complex phases of low - energy gaugino masses .",
    "it might be an interesting possibility that non - vanishing phases of gaugino masses are detectable in future particle experiments  @xcite .",
    "but , in that case , other parameters should be carefully chosen so as to satisfy various severe constraints which come from approximate cp conservations observed in nature .    in this work",
    ", we pursue a more natural way that each gaugino mass has no more tiny phase ; namely , all gaugino mass phases are aligned , which are rotated away by a single @xmath37 rotation .",
    "it is clear from ( [ gauginomass ] ) that this is achieved by realizing a tiny relative phase between the two supersymmetry - breaking @xmath11 terms .",
    "the ratio is simply written as @xmath38_x,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the supergravity khler potential : @xmath40 .",
    "but it is suitable for practical purpose that the ratio is rewritten with @xmath6 and @xmath15 ; @xmath41 since we now consider @xmath1 as a moduli field , any derivatives of the khler potential @xmath6 are real valued , irrespectively of its detailed form . when this ratio of two @xmath11 terms is real , all gauginos receive supersymmetry - breaking masses with aligned complex phases and they can be made real .",
    "we find from eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) that this is the case if @xmath42    the condition ( [ cpcond ] ) must be satisfied in the vacuum of the supergravity scalar potential . with the moduli khler potential ( [ kahler ] ) , it is easy to first minimize the scalar potential with respect to the imaginary part of @xmath1 ( @xmath43 ) ; @xmath44.\\ ] ] this leads to a condition @xmath45 it is found that when gaugino mass phases are small , namely , the condition ( [ cpcond ] ) is satisfied , the following equation : @xmath46 is also satisfied in the vacuum as long as the moduli field causes supersymmetry breaking ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the reverse is also true that if one has superpotential satisfying @xmath48 = real , then @xmath49 takes a real value and the condition for aligned gaugino masses is certainly realized at the extrema of supergravity potential .",
    "it is important that the equation ( [ wxxwx ] ) is integrable .",
    "that is , since the superpotential @xmath4 is a holomorphic function , @xmath48 should be a real constant with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "( it may be rather unlikely that the reality condition is satisfied with real coupling constants and/or vacuum expectation values .",
    "that might be realized only in a special circumstance where an original theory contains real parameters and would also require additional requirements . )",
    "we thus find the most general moduli superpotential leading to aligned gaugino masses @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are @xmath1-independent factors and , in particular , @xmath52 must be real .",
    "the negative sign in front of @xmath52 is just a convention .",
    "we have found that , with the moduli superpotential ( [ spot1 ] ) , all gaugino masses can be made real in the extrema of supergravity scalar potential and do not induce large cp - violating operators .",
    "it should be noted that the result has been derived without specifying a detailed form of the moduli khler potential . in the complete analysis of scalar potential with a fixed form of @xmath6",
    ", one should check whether it is a ( at least local ) minimum of the potential .",
    "that will be examined in the next section .",
    "we have so far focused only on the phases of gaugino mass parameters .",
    "similar arguments are also applied to other supersymmetry - breaking parameters .",
    "let us define , as usual , a holomorphic soft breaking parameter as a ratio of a coupling of holomorphic supersymmetry - breaking term to a corresponding superpotential one .",
    "these soft - breaking parameters are unaffected by phase redefinitions of chiral superfields .",
    "we will explicitly show in the next section that , if the condition ( [ cpcond ] ) for aligned gaugino masses is satisfied , all complex phases of holomorphic soft parameters are aligned to that of gaugino masses and become real once gaugino masses are rotated to be real by @xmath37 rotation .    our argument above is based on the supergravity scalar potential which is controlled by two functions @xmath34 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is known that the supergravity potential is invariant under khler transformation involving these two functions : @xmath54 and @xmath55 with an arbitrary function @xmath56 .",
    "noting that the khler potential depends on the moduli in the form of ( [ kahler ] ) , the only possible transformation is given by @xmath57 with a real factor @xmath58 .",
    "after such transformation , we have the superpotential @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are complex and real @xmath1-independent factors , respectively .",
    "this is another form of moduli superpotential which satisfies our requirement that cp invariance is not broken by the moduli physics .",
    "that is , complex phases of soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters are aligned in the vacuum of supergravity potential .",
    "one should note that this form of the moduli superpotential as a solution to the supersymmetric cp problem was recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite      in the previous section we found two types of superpotential for moduli fields . with these forms of superpotential ,",
    "one obtains phenomenologically favorable results ; namely , cp - violating effects of moduli are automatically suppressed in the vacuum . on the other hand , more formal aspects , e.g.  the questions of whether such potentials are derived from some high - energy theory and which of these two forms is relevant , may depend on the property of moduli fields and its natural form of khler potentials .",
    "for some specific moduli fields , the superpotential forms ( [ spot1 ] ) and ( [ spot2 ] ) have been discussed in the literature . among these",
    "is that @xmath1 is the dilaton superfield in four - dimensional effective theory of superstring . in this case ,",
    "an exponential factor @xmath62 emerges through gaugino condensation  @xcite where the constant @xmath52 is inversely proportional to the gauge beta function and therefore a real parameter , just as needed .",
    "a likely example of dilaton stabilization along this line is the racetrack mechanism  @xcite with superpotential of the form ( [ spot2 ] ) .",
    "however it was found that a realistic value of gauge coupling is achieved only in rather complicated models , for example , with more than two condensations . the constant @xmath53 term in ( [ spot1 ] ) is also known to play important roles of the dilaton stabilization and supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "we should note that such a type of superpotential with the constant term is obtained in a five - dimensional model  @xcite where @xmath1 is the radius modulus which determines the size of the compact fifth dimension .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , it is revealed in perturbative string theory that there exist some massless moduli fields whose presence may be in contradiction to low - energy experiments .",
    "recently , it has been discussed that all such moduli can be stabilized in some string compactifications with non - trivial fluxes . as an example , let us consider a class of type iib orientifold compactification .",
    "the absence of non - trivial fluxes classically leads to supersymmetric vacua which are described by the dilaton modulus , complex structure ( shape ) moduli , and complexified khler ( size ) moduli .",
    "if three - form field strengths are turned on , they give rise to a tree - level superpotential @xmath63  @xcite . having this superpotential in hand ,",
    "the vacuum is explored with effective four - dimensional supergravity potential .",
    "it is found that for a generic choice of fluxes , the minimization of potential fixes all shape moduli and the dilaton  @xcite .",
    "this scheme of stabilization sets the expectation value of the dilaton to a weak coupling and is under reliable control .",
    "the above superpotential @xmath63 is , however , independent of the khler size moduli and they can take arbitrary values .",
    "one needs some additional potential which might be generated by stringy and quantum corrections to khler and/or superpotentials .",
    "it is suggested by kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt ) in  @xcite that the khler size moduli can be stabilized by including non - perturbative corrections  @xcite to the tree - level superpotential .",
    "these corrections are known to depend on the size moduli and be controlled at weak coupling .",
    "@xcite discussed two types of such non - perturbative effects : ( i ) d - brane instantons and ( ii ) gaugino condensation . in the case ( i ) , the source of superpotential is d3-brane instantons wrapped on surfaces in the calabi - yau three - fold .",
    "the instanton - induced superpotential takes the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the complexified volumes , which are natural holomorphic coordinates appearing in type iib orientifold compactification . in the large volume limit ,",
    "the shape moduli are stabilized by the leading contribution @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly one can use @xmath66 as effective superpotential for the khler size moduli . in the case of",
    "( ii ) , the superpotential is supposed to be generated by non - perturbative effects in world - volume gauge theory on d7 branes .",
    "the gauge coupling in this theory depends on the volume @xmath67 and thus non - perturbative effects lead to a superpotential @xmath68 .",
    "the constant @xmath69 is real and related to the gauge beta function which is of order @xmath70 for @xmath71 gauge theory . for a small value of the flux superpotential @xmath63 , the supersymmetric condition for a size modulus is satisfied with a large value of @xmath67 .    in both cases ,",
    "the non - perturbative contribution to superpotential is of the form @xmath72 ( for the case ( i ) , the leading order in the large volume limit ) .",
    "the effective superpotential is therefore given by @xmath66 .",
    "it is found that all the complex structure moduli and the ten - dimensional dilaton are frozen by the fluxes ( the first term ) , which are essentially decoupled from low - energy effective theory and thus do not play any role in supersymmetry breaking , while the second term generated by non - perturbative stringy corrections can stabilize all remaining khler moduli which arise in low - energy effective theory . as we mentioned , @xmath63 is a constant with respect to the khler size moduli .",
    "moreover the parameter @xmath52 in @xmath73 is real in either case .",
    "remarkably , the resulting moduli superpotential is exactly the same form as we have derived in the previous subsection by looking for phenomenologically preferable moduli potential .    in heterotic / m theory , there",
    "might also exist similar mechanism to stabilize all heterotic moduli to the proposal of kklt .",
    "first , flux - induced superpotentials fix all shape moduli and in some cases also the size modulus , which is not the case for type iib string . after including non - perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation and world - sheet instanton effects , all remaining moduli",
    "are shown to be stabilized  @xcite .",
    "see also other approaches , for example , using non - khler background with gaugino condensation to stabilize the dilaton modulus  @xcite .",
    "anyway the resulting superpotential generally takes the common form , @xmath66 , and is consistent to our result ( [ spot1 ] ) of cp - conserving moduli potential ( now for the dilaton or radius modulus ) .",
    "we finally comment on typical scales of dimensionful parameters as well as possible field - theoretical origins of the moduli superpotential .",
    "the exponential dependence of the moduli field is realized in various ways . as explained above , for the dilaton and related variables , that is induced by gaugino condensations or non - perturbative effects in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "therefore a natural scale of the coefficient @xmath51 in ( [ spot1 ] ) might be on the fundamental scale of the theory .",
    "on the other hand , the constant term @xmath53 is related to supersymmetry breaking and should be suppressed relative to the fundamental scale in order to have low - energy supersymmetry . the detailed analysis in the following sections",
    "will show that a small @xmath53 is , in fact , relevant to various phenomenology of the model . in the flux compactification , following the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , a small constant @xmath53 may be obtained by cancellation among contributions from many fluxes .",
    "the suppression can also be achieved by similar dynamics which generate the exponential term , that is , an exponentially small @xmath53 is obtained by gaugino condensation in additional gauge factor .",
    "another simple way to have a suppressed constant term comes from symmetry argument and is described by a wess - zumino model without introducing any extra gauge factors .",
    "let us consider the following superpotential : @xmath74 the last term in the right - hand side causes soft breaking of @xmath37 symmetry , and one expects a constant superpotential to be generated .",
    "integrating out the massive fields , we actually obtain a constant superpotential @xmath75 .",
    "a suppressed value of @xmath53 is natural in a sense that the first and second terms in ( [ wc ] ) are @xmath37 exact and the third softly breaks the @xmath37 invariance .",
    "it is noted that the superpotential ( [ wc ] ) is the most general and renormalizable one , provided that one imposes the parity [ @xmath76 , @xmath77 in addition to the @xmath37 invariance [ @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "in the previous section , we have found that a moduli superfield @xmath1 is expected to have the following potentials for realistic phenomenology : @xmath80 the superpotential form has been determined by the requirement of suppressing gaugino mass phases . in this section iii",
    ", we will fully analyze the supergravity potential of moduli and investigate its phenomenological implications in the vacuum .",
    "the supergravity potential in the conformal frame now to be investigated is given by @xmath81,\\ ] ] where we have defined the real function @xmath82 .",
    "note that only the last term depends on the imaginary part @xmath83 of the moduli field . minimizing the potential with respect to @xmath83",
    ", we have @xmath84 which determines the expectation value of @xmath83 as @xmath85 the sign of @xmath86 is chosen so that the extremum is a minimum , that is , the second derivative with respect to @xmath83 should be positive at the extremum .",
    "this results in the condition @xmath87 . in the minimum of @xmath83 ,",

    "the first case is @xmath186 and @xmath212 . in this case",
    ", the moduli contribution has a resemblance to the dilaton dominated scenario in string - inspired supergravity . in fig .",
    "[ dilaton_mass ] , we show the mass spectrum for typical superparticles as the functions of @xmath132 .",
    "one can see from the figure that the mass hierarchy among the superparticles is more suppressed for a larger value of @xmath132 , i.e.  with a larger suppression of the moduli contribution for a fixed @xmath19 . here",
    "we have taken @xmath213  tev .",
    "it is interesting that a lower bound of sparticle masses is obtained by examining the experimental bound on the lightest higgs boson mass .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ dilaton_higgs ] the mass contours of @xmath198 in the ( @xmath214 ) plane . in the numerical estimation of the higgs mass , we used the feynhiggs package  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of a heavy scalar top leads to a lower bound of the supersymmetry - breaking scale @xmath19 .",
    "it is also found from the figure that , when the couplings in the moduli superpotential take natural values @xmath215 and @xmath216 tev / planck in the planck unit , @xmath132 is given by @xmath217 and therefore @xmath19 must be larger than 10  tev .",
    "this bound in turn implies that the sparticles must be heavier than about 300  gev ( see fig .",
    "[ dilaton_mass ] ) .",
    "furthermore the lightest superparticle is the bino - dominant neutralino , but contains significant amount of the higgsino component .",
    "this fact , however , relies on several assumptions , for example , a choice of the index @xmath218 for hidden - sector field through the @xmath11-term relation ( [ fxfphi ] ) in the vacuum , and the higgsino may become the lightest for other region .",
    "thus , a general message is that the lightest sparticle is given by a considerable mixture of neutral gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "finally , we note that the lower bound of @xmath11 terms derived from the lightest higgs mass bound is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath201 and @xmath219 . in our numerical analysis , we have taken @xmath205 and @xmath220  gev .",
    "when @xmath201 and/or @xmath219 increases , the higgs boson mass receives larger corrections , so the bound on @xmath11 imposed by the higgs mass is weakened .",
    "for instance , for @xmath221 we numerically checked that the higgs mass increases only by about @xmath222@xmath223  gev , and thus the bound on @xmath19 does not change significantly .",
    "the next example is for moduli with @xmath187 , which often appear in supergravity or superstring theory ( e.g.  khler size moduli in flux compactifications ) .",
    "a simple choice of matter khler potential is @xmath224 .",
    "consequently , sfermions do not receive soft masses from the moduli field .",
    "the spectrum at a high - energy scale is therefore a class of the non - universal gaugino masses ( [ gaumass ] ) and sfermion masses given by the anomaly mediation .",
    "it should be noted that the model does not suffer from the problem of tachyonic sleptons in the pure anomaly mediation scenario due to the heaviness of bino .",
    "that is , the gauginos obtain the contribution from the light moduli field and lift up sfermion masses via renormalization . in fig .",
    "[ moduli_mass ] , we show the sparticle mass spectrum at the electroweak scale .",
    "again we have taken @xmath213  tev .",
    "as in the case of @xmath186 moduli examined above , we also find the lower bound of @xmath19 from the lightest higgs mass bound ( fig .",
    "[ moduli_higgs ] ) . for natural values of the superpotential couplings",
    ", @xmath132 takes a value of about 35 and that leads to a lower bound of @xmath225  tev from the current experimental result .",
    "then the lightest neutralino mass has to be larger than about 500  gev .",
    "it is however noted that , in the present simple case , the lightest superparticle is the scalar tau lepton in a wide range of parameter space , which is slightly lighter than the lightest neutralino .",
    "the existence of such a stable charged particle is unfavorable for cosmology but does not necessarily mean a disaster .",
    "one could easily incorporate some remedies to modify sfermion masses by introducing the renormalization - group running above the gauge coupling unification scale  @xcite or some origins of additional contributions to scalar masses .",
    "a possible source of the latter is given by weak violation of the sequestering of the visible sector from the moduli field in the khler potential .",
    "the sequestering is generically not protected by some symmetry but rather may receive radiative corrections . as a result , one could have some additional terms to soft scalar masses .",
    "for example , consider the khler potential @xmath226 with tiny @xmath227 , which induces additional terms not only in scalar soft masses but also in trilinear couplings .",
    "these two sources could be parameterized by turning on the matter indices @xmath185 in the khler potential .",
    "thus we can systematically take into account model - dependent scalar masses without affecting the gaugino sector for a fixed value of @xmath91 . in that case , @xmath185 are no longer integers , in general .",
    "similarly one may consider a correction to @xmath91 .",
    "the result of a numerical computation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ nm_higgsino ] on the ( @xmath228 ) plane , where we take the universal khler index , @xmath229 , for simplicity . in the shadowed region ,",
    "the scalar tau is lighter than the lightest neutralino .",
    "as @xmath230 increases , the neutralino becomes lighter than the scalar tau .",
    "for instance , for @xmath187 moduli , a relatively small correction , i.e.  a small size of @xmath231 , is sufficient to make the scalar tau heavy and the theory becomes phenomenologically viable . in the same figure",
    ", we also draw the contours of the higgsino composition @xmath232 in the lightest neutralino , which is defined as @xmath233 where the lightest neutralino @xmath234 consists of @xmath235 .",
    "when @xmath232 is larger than 0.5 , it is called higgsino - dominant . in the figure , @xmath19 is fixed at 20  tev , and @xmath236 has been assumed for simplicity . for this choice of @xmath19 and @xmath218",
    ", there is the higgsino - dominant region for small values of @xmath230 , and the higgsino composition is still quite sizable , much larger than , say , 0.1 for a wider region of the parameter space .",
    "it is noticed that the higgsino composition becomes smaller as @xmath230 ( @xmath237 in this case ) increases .",
    "this is because , for larger @xmath218 , @xmath132 becomes smaller , increasing the mass difference between the bino and the gluino .",
    "thus the @xmath25 parameter , which is controlled by the gluino mass , tends to be large relative to the bino mass , making the higgsino composition small .",
    "different choices of @xmath218 may give slightly different results .",
    "in fact , we considered the case where @xmath238 is fixed , and found the increase of the higgsino composition , e.g.  even a higgsino - dominant region appears for smaller @xmath230 , while the neutralino mass is kept smaller than the scalar tau mass .",
    "another thing we find is that if one increases the scale @xmath19 , the higgsino composition tends to increase as well . that is understood from the fact that , for a larger @xmath19 , the bino mass increases but the @xmath25 parameter becomes smaller [ see fig .  [ gaugino_gut ] and eq .  ( [ mu - fitting ] ) ] .",
    "another simple way to cure the cosmological problem of sequestered khler potential with @xmath187 moduli is to introduce additional universal masses to sfermions .",
    "such terms may arise in the khler potential due to the weak but non - negligible direct couplings between the visible and hidden sectors .",
    "since we assume a suppressed vacuum expectation value of the scalar component of the hidden sector field , they do not contribute to the trilinear couplings .",
    "the magnitudes and patterns of additional masses generally depend on the details of models , for example , the origins of corrections , the configurations of branes , and so on . but to incorporate such additional scalar masses is a reasonable way to overcome the trouble with too light sfermions , often discussed in the literature . in the following , we assume universal corrections to scalar masses , @xmath239 , for simplicity",
    ". then the contributions are shown as : @xmath240 with a positive @xmath239 , the mass of right - handed scalar tau is lifted up . on the contrary",
    ", we notice that the masses of bino and higgsino do not receive large corrections from @xmath239 .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 depends weakly on the universal shift of the scalar masses due to the cancellation among them .",
    "actually , in the fitting formula of @xmath203 ( [ mu - fitting ] ) , one can see that the universal corrections from the scalar top and up - type higgs cancel out with each other , and @xmath25 is mainly controlled by the gluino mass only . in the end ,",
    "the property of the neutralino sector is unchanged and the lightest neutralino , being an admixture of the bino and the higgsino , becomes the lightest superparticle . for illustration",
    ", we add in fig .",
    "[ moduli_mass ] the dashed red line which depicts the mass of right - handed scalar tau for @xmath241 .",
    "here we have taken @xmath242 as an example .",
    "it is numerically checked that the right - handed scalar tau becomes heavier than the lightest neutralino if @xmath243 is larger than @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) for @xmath205 ( 40 ) , respectively .",
    "the dependence on @xmath201 can be understood from the fact that the tau scalar mass squared receives significant and negative radiative corrections from @xmath246 fermion loops in the renormalization - group evolution with large @xmath246 yukawa coupling .",
    "we conclude that @xmath243 with @xmath247 can easily give the mass spectrum with the neutralino lightest superparticle .    finally , we comment on the case of strong violation of the sequestered form of the khler potential .",
    "in particular , the absence of the fourth - powered term @xmath248 is due to the assumption of sequestering in the above analysis .",
    "this assumption requires a special form of khler potential , that is , on a choice of @xmath91 and @xmath185 . on the other hand , more general sets of @xmath91 and @xmath185",
    "often lead to un - suppressed fourth - powered terms . then with non - vanishing @xmath11 terms of hidden - sector fields , they induce soft masses for visible scalar particles .",
    "this contribution could be involved in the analysis by introducing scalar masses @xmath243 again . if the khler potential has no sequestering form at all , @xmath243",
    "is expected to be comparable to @xmath249 , when considering the vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "such a large @xmath243 exceeds contributions to the scalar masses from the moduli and anomaly mediations by 12 orders of magnitude .",
    "we find from numerical evaluation that the introduction of such large @xmath243 is disfavored because of the failure of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "too large additional scalar masses make the up - type higgs mass huge so that the conditions for radiative symmetry breaking are not satisfied at least with the universal scalar masses at the unification scale . on the other hand",
    ", it is found that the higgs bosons develop non - vanishing expectation values for @xmath250 . below that scale",
    ", the neutralino may be light to the level of @xmath251  gev , depending on the value of @xmath249 .",
    "as in the previous cases , the higgsino mass tends to degenerate with that of the bino .",
    "finally , we comment on the effects of scalar trilinear couplings . in the setup above , we neglected additional contributions to trilinear couplings .",
    "such contributions highly depend on the models and need more detailed analysis with an explicit form of lagrangian . anyway",
    "the strong violation of sequestering gives rise to a possibility of large @xmath243 comparable to @xmath19 , which requires fine tuning among scalar masses for successful electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "both gravitino and moduli are heavy with a small mass hierarchy between them .",
    "the gravitino is heavier than supersymmetry - breaking mass scale ( squarks , etc . ) , and the moduli is still heavier than the gravitino .",
    "cosmological features with this mass hierarchy have recently been studied in refs .",
    "the heavy gravitino decays before the big - bang nucleosynthesis starts .",
    "the hadronic showers produced at the gravitino decay were shown to affect the neutron to proton number ratio , changing thus the @xmath252he abundance  @xcite . though the comparison with the observations of @xmath252he abundance yields the constraint on the gravitino abundance , it is not as severe as the constraint from other light elements . thus considering the heavy gravitino scenario greatly relaxes the otherwise severe gravitino problem .",
    "the moduli fields with mass of order @xmath253  tev or even higher can decay much faster than 1 sec , and thus the reheating temperature after the moduli decay is much higher than 1  mev , which is compatible with the success of the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis scenario  @xcite .    in the scenario we presented , the moduli decay mainly into the gauge bosons , but also decay to gravitinos with non - negligible branching ratio .",
    "it was shown  @xcite , however , that the gravitinos produced in this way do not spoil the big - bang nucleosynthesis in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "thus , we conclude that in our scenario both the gravitino and the moduli problems can be solved simultaneously .",
    "one of the fascinating features of supersymmetric models is that the lightest superparticle is stable under the usual assumption of @xmath37 parity conservation and thus it is a natural candidate for dark matter in the universe .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the case where the lightest among the neutralinos becomes the lightest of the whole superparticles and thus a dark matter candidate . in our present setup , since the gravitino and the modulinos , the fermionic components of moduli supermultiplets , are rather heavy , the lightest neutralino is likely the lightest among the superparticles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model . assuming the neutralino is the lightest sparticle",
    ", we will briefly discuss this issue of neutralino dark matter .",
    "let us first consider the relic abundance of the neutralino under the assumption that the universe underwent the standard thermal history , namely , no entropy production nor non - thermal production of neutralinos takes place around and after the freeze - out of the neutralinos .",
    "then the computation of the thermal relic abundance can be done in a standard matter .",
    "it should be compared with the value inferred from observations .",
    "inclusion of the wmap data implies  @xcite the cold dark matter abundance to be @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the density parameter of the cold dark matter component , and @xmath256 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "the dark matter analysis was most extensively done in the minimal supergravity scenario .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the thermal relic abundance tends to be too large , compared to the value obtained after the wmap . to be compatible with the observation",
    ", one needs some efficient annihilation mechanisms , including ( i ) light neutralino and light sfermions , ( ii ) co - annihilation , ( iii ) resonance enhancement in higgs exchanges , and ( iv ) annihilation into w boson pair .",
    "notice that the last one is effective for wino or higgsino being the lightest sparticle , the latter of which is realized only in the focus point region  @xcite in the minimal supergravity .",
    "the situation in the present setup is a bit different from the minimal supergravity case . as we emphasized before",
    ", the higgsino mass parameter @xmath25 is relatively small due to the suppressed gluino mass .",
    "thus the lightest neutralino contains a significant amount of higgsino components , which may enhance the annihilation cross section .",
    "though the thermal relic abundance of order 0.1 or so in terms of the density parameter is expected , the actual value is , however , rather sensitive to the portion of the higgsino components and also to the mass of the lightest neutralino .",
    "we now would like to quantify the argument given above .",
    "for this purpose , we will illustrate the two cases : ( 1 ) @xmath186 , @xmath257 and ( 2 ) @xmath187 , @xmath258 with extra universal contribution to scalar masses , both of which cases were examined in the previous section . in the numerical computation , we use the darksusy package  @xcite .",
    "first let us discuss the case ( 1 ) @xmath186 , @xmath257 . as was pointed out ,",
    "the neutralino in this case is bino - dominant , but with a significant portion of higgsinos .",
    "we show its thermal relic abundance in fig .",
    "[ dilaton_relic ] . in the same figure ,",
    "the mass of the lightest neutralino is also plotted .",
    "here we have taken @xmath259 and @xmath205 . imposing the lep - ii bound on the higgs mass , only the region with @xmath260  tev",
    "has been found to be allowed ( see fig .",
    "[ dilaton_higgs ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is found from fig .",
    "[ dilaton_relic ] that @xmath19 is roughly bounded to be @xmath261  tev in order not to exceed the upper constraint ( [ omega ] ) from the wmap observation because of the significant suppression of the neutralino relic abundance due to the annihilation .",
    "thus , for the range 10  tev @xmath262  tev , the thermal relic density of the lightest superparticle is consistent with the wmap observation and also the higgs boson mass bound is satisfied .",
    "moreover , the thermal relic becomes the dominant component of dark matter on the upper side of the @xmath19 range . for a larger value of @xmath19 , to be consistent with the wmap value",
    ", some dilution mechanism should be in operation .",
    "we then turn to the case ( 2 ) @xmath187 , @xmath258 with extra universal contribution to scalar masses denoted by @xmath243 .",
    "the @xmath243 contribution is added to make the scalar tau heavier than the lightest neutralino , as was discussed in the previous section .",
    "the lightest neutralino in this case is an ( almost full ) admixture of higgsinos and bino ( for the choice of @xmath263 ) .",
    "in fact , it is found that the ratio of the bino mass parameter relative to the @xmath25 parameter varies from 0.9 to 1.1 as @xmath19 increases from 10 to 50  tev . at the same time , the higgsino component of the chargino degenerates with the neutralino very well .",
    "we therefore expect efficient annihilation of the neutralino as well as the neutralino - chargino coannihilation , and hence relatively small relic abundance .",
    "assuming the standard thermal history , we obtain the numerical result in fig .",
    "[ moduli_relic ] , where the contours of the relic abundance ( solid lines ) and the lightest neutralino mass ( dashed lines ) are plotted .",
    "here we have taken @xmath205 . in tiny @xmath243 region ,",
    "the lightest sparticle becomes charged , namely , the right - handed scalar tau , which should be excluded ( shaded region ) , and the shadow region in the bottom is also experimentally disfavored from the lightest higgs boson mass .",
    "we find from the figure that , for a large portion of the parameter space , the relic abundance of the neutralino is smaller than about 0.1 , in accord with the wmap observation .",
    "note , however , that it does not saturate the dark matter density unless the lightest neutralino mass reaches 1  tev region .",
    "we have so far assumed the standard thermal history .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the thermal history of the heavy gravitino / moduli scenario may be very different from the standard one  @xcite . the moduli decay release a huge entropy to reheat the universe , following the era where the moduli oscillation dominates the energy density .",
    "the neutralinos in the primordial origin will be completely diluted by the entropy production .",
    "the neutralinos can , however , be produced in non - thermal origin . with the small mass hierarchy among the moduli , gravitino , and superpartners of the standard - model fields",
    ", the moduli can decay to gravitinos , followed by the gravitino decay into lighter superparticles .",
    "they subsequently decay to the lightest superparticles , i.e.  the neutralinos .",
    "it was shown that , in certain regions of the parameter space , the relic abundance of the neutralino produced by this decay chain is in accord with the dark matter density obtained from the wmap observation , while the decay products of gravitinos do not spoil the success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "furthermore , the neutralinos may be re - generated in the thermal bath if the reheating temperature is high enough .",
    "the latter production may be important when the neutralino contains a significant composition of higgsinos so that the annihilation process is effective .",
    "it is a very interesting question whether non - thermal mechanisms can yield the cold dark matter whose abundance is in accord with the observations in our particular setup .",
    "this issue will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "finally , we would like to make comments on direct / indirect detections of the neutralino dark matter in the present scenario .",
    "the crucial observation is , as we already repeated , the neutralino is an admixture of the higgsino and the bino .",
    "furthermore , as the gluino is relatively light , the squark masses are also somewhat suppressed . as a result , given a neutralino mass , the scattering cross section off the nuclei as well as the annihilation cross section into photons , neutrinos , and so on will be enhanced compared to , e.g.  the minimal supergravity case with the universal gaugino mass . a larger cross section increases the chance of detection . on the other hand , in the setup we have presented in this paper , the lightest neutralino tends to be relatively heavy due to the higgs boson mass bound .",
    "a heavier neutralino then decreases the chance of detection .",

    "@xmath268 from eq .",
    "( [ fxzq ] ) . from astronomical observations ,",
    "the universe is known to have almost flat geometry , so the hidden - sector contribution should be introduced and tuned to suppress the cosmological constant .",
    "we would like to stress that the global structure of moduli potential is also affected by the hidden - sector contribution @xmath266 .",
    "actually the whole potential @xmath67 generically has a barrier between the origin and infinity in the moduli space , when considering vanishing cosmological constant with negative @xmath269 .",

    "thus the potential goes to be suppressed in the limit of large @xmath96 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath91 is in the range @xmath270 , the potential has a negative value at its minimum if one ignores the hidden sector contribution . then taking into account @xmath266 with negative @xmath269 in order to tune the cosmological constant , the potential around the minimum",
    "is uplifted so that the barrier is obtained in the region between the true vacuum and the infinity in the moduli space .",
    "it is important to notice that the barrier structure may be washed out by the thermal effects in the early universe .",
    "the light particles , which interact with each other , construct a thermal bath in the early universe .",
    "the effective potential at finite temperature acquires additional terms which depend on both the temperature and coupling constants .",
    "since , in the present setup , a non - vanishing value of moduli field contributes gauge coupling constants , the moduli value is affected by thermal effects .",

    "the coupling dependence of the free energy ( [ fe ] ) leads to potential terms of moduli fields which are related to the gauge coupling @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "an important point is that @xmath116 is negative .",
    "that is , a smaller value of gauge coupling decreases the free energy . since the gauge coupling constant ( @xmath277 ) is shifted by @xmath96 in our scenario , the moduli expectation value tends to be driven to infinity .",
    "this kind of destabilization of the potential is rather different from other cosmological problems such as the moduli or gravitino problem .",
    "if the temperature becomes high enough in the early universe , actually higher than the so - called critical temperature , and once the moduli field goes over its potential barrier , the moduli can not be recovered to take the original value even with high temperature due to late - time entropy production .",
    "thus the global structure of the potential is very important to investigate the cosmological scenario .",
    "the thermal effects have been studied for the kklt models with @xmath187 moduli khler potential  @xcite .",

    "the latter type of moduli superpotential is realized by multiple ( in this case , two ) gaugino condensations . on the other hand ,",
    "our model - independent approach is based on the automatic cp conservation in the soft terms , a highly phenomenological argument .",
    "it is an interesting result that suppressing large cp violation leads to the unique moduli potential which stabilizes the moduli and triggers supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the scalar potential for the moduli becomes rather steep around its minimum due to the exponentials with large exponents , and thus the moduli mass becomes much larger than the gravitino mass . in turn , this implies the suppression of supersymmetry breaking in the moduli @xmath11 term .",
    "we have shown that with the kklt - type superpotential the moduli mediation and the anomaly mediation make comparable contributions in size to the soft supersymmetry breaking masses .",
    "the resulting mass spectrum of the superparticles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model is very different from that of the minimal supergravity and of the pure anomaly mediation .",
    "therefore this scenario is testable in future collider experiments by measuring the masses of superparticles .",
    "one of the most important observations made in the kklt - type case is that the three gauginos belonging to different gauge groups of the standard model tend to rather degenerate in mass at the weak scale , which brings some characteristic features of the superparticle mass spectrum . in particular , the lightest neutralino becomes a considerable admixture of the higgsinos and the gauginos ( mostly bino ) .",
    "this should have some impact on collider signals as well as neutralino dark matter searches .",
    "we have briefly discussed cosmological implications of the scenario .",
    "heavy gravitino and moduli fields are cosmologically welcome",
    ". they can solve the gravitino problem and also the moduli problem associated with the huge late - time entropy production after the moduli - dominated era .",
    "much should remain to be seen in the cosmology of this scenario .",
    "particularly interesting and also important is to establish a thorough cosmological evolution of this setup , including inflation model and cosmological behavior of the moduli field .",
    "it is also an interesting extension to include more numbers of moduli fields which participate in supersymmetry breaking .",
    "that may be a generic situation even after fluxes are introduced in superstring compactifications .",
    "one should address the questions of cp phases in gaugino masses as well as of induced flavor mixings and cp violation in the sfermion sector .",
    "we leave such investigations to future work .",
    "the authors would like to thank k.  choi for useful discussion .",
