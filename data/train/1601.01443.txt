    "quarkonia production in urhic  see @xcite for a recent review  is one of the best probes of the color - deconfined qcd medium of high temperature  the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  achieved in these collisions .",
    "the production of bottomonia is of particular interest as it is much less impacted by exogenous recombination than charmonia production and then less difficult to model .",
    "a dynamical calculation of the @xmath3 evolution satisfying the basic principles of quantum mechanics is a genuine open quantum system . as a possible method to tackle this problem",
    ", we use the so - called schrdinger - langevin equation ( sle ) introduced by kostin  @xcite for the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom ( relative coordinates of the pair ) @xmath4\\,\\psi\\ , .",
    "\\label{sleq}\\ ] ] in this equation , the non linear term @xmath5 is a dissipative friction term based on the wave function phase @xmath6 while the term @xmath7 represents a stochastic dipolar force .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath8 encodes the dynamics in the absence of such interactions with the medium .",
    "the sle admits some important properties : norm conservation  despite a non linear term and contrarily to similar treatments relying on imaginary potentials  ,",
    "respect of the heisenberg principle , violation of the superposition principle,  the stochastic forces drive the system from a pure state to a mixed state .",
    "observables are built using an ensemble average over these forces , which necessitates to evaluate replications of the time evolution , a feature well suited to monte carlo simulations .",
    "the sle naturally allows to deal with the transitions from the bound states to the continuum , at the core of quarkonia deconfinement .",
    "the asymptotic thermalization of a subsystem coupled to a heat bath is a particular issue of the sle , whose mastering is essential to obtain reliable predictions . in @xcite , we have investigated this problem for the 1d case , both for a harmonic and a linear potential and for white  where @xmath9  and colored stochastic forces . even though the state weights @xmath10 ( defined as @xmath11 ) do not systematically converge towards some boltzmann distribution @xmath12 for the `` canonical '' expression of @xmath13 ",
    "@xmath14 $ ]  , it is indeed the case for a subset of low lying eigenstates provided one adapts the autocorrelation @xmath13 as @xmath15 where the relation @xmath16 depends on the particular potential .    for a first application of the sle to the problem of bottomonia suppression in urhic , we adopt a 1d modeling of the @xmath3 pairs , with even ( resp .",
    "odd ) 1d - states mocking s ( resp .",
    "p ) 3d - states . in vacuum ,",
    "the potential in @xmath8 is taken as @xmath17 , truncated to @xmath18 ( according to lqcd calculations @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath19 is chosen as 4.575 gev , while the string parameter @xmath20 is chosen to obtain an energy difference between the first two even states @xmath21 .",
    "even and odd bound states are found for @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev which are in good agreement with corresponding experimental values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "one notices however that the binding energy of the @xmath26 is just 20 mev in this model , much smaller than the real 3d - case .",
    "thus , little confidence is put into predictions concerning this precise state , a default that will be corrected in a future parametrization of the potential .",
    "investigating the time evolution asymptotics with @xmath27 in @xmath8 as well as with the friction term and the stochastic forces turned on , a detailed study shows that a correct thermalization is achieved by using @xmath28 in the expression ( [ eq : b_rescaling ] ) of @xmath13 . at finite temperature ,",
    "however , the potential should be debye - screened .",
    "this feature is implemented in our model by letting the maximal value @xmath29 be @xmath30-dependent in @xmath8  which then acquires the status of a mean field ( mf ) hamiltonian  and taken as the asymptotic ( @xmath31 ) value of the finite-@xmath30 lqcd potential . as some ambiguity subsists on the most appropriate choice at finite-@xmath30 , two prescriptions have been investigated for @xmath29 : the internal energy @xmath32  @xcite ( which shows some extra binding around @xmath33 ) as well as a potential suggested by mocsy and petreczky  @xcite ( our privileged choice in these proceedings ) characterized by some weaker binding as compared to @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding 1d - potentials are referred to as @xmath32 and @xmath34 . in the sle approach ,",
    "the friction / drag coefficient @xmath35 for the relative motion is considered to be identical to the one for single heavy flavor ( a feature that can be intuited starting from the 2-body sle and introducing the center of mass and the relative coordinates ) .",
    "it is taken from @xcite  @xmath36  applying on the top a factor @xmath37 to match the open heavy flavor experimental data at lhc .",
    "contrarily to some common analysis , we do not pay much attention the precise temperatures at which the various bound states `` melt '' under the influence of the mf in @xmath8 .",
    "we believe that such an analysis is not very relevant for the problem of bottomonia suppression in urhic , not only because the medium is not stationary ( see section [ sec : coll_urhic ] ) but also because a ) the evolution time of the @xmath3 is finite so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks which are found close to each other at the end of the evolution have a possibility to recombine into some bound state and b ) if one waits long enough , the stochastic forces may destroy bound states at any temperature anyhow .",
    "instead , we investigate the capability of these forces as well as of the `` screening '' to modify the ( vacuum ) state content of some initial wave function @xmath40 through dynamical evolution .",
    "we provide such an analysis in fig .  [",
    "fig : station ] , for typical qgp temperatures happening in urhic and starting from a pure ( vacuum ) eigenstate considered at rest .",
    "for each temperature and each initial state , three models are investigated to understand the respective contributions of the screening and of the stochastic forces . in all cases",
    ", the time evolution populates a large variety of @xmath3 eigenstates ( at the exception of the evolution with the mf only which conserves the parity ) . when stochastic forces are turned on , one observes , after some transient phase lasting @xmath41 , an asymptotic regime where all considered weights decay uniformly .",
    "this is due to the global probability flow driven out of the potential well by these forces ( while for the pure mf case , a finite probability is trapped in this well ) . during this asymptotic regime ,",
    "the weight ratios tend towards values which solely depend on @xmath30 ( as can be seen by comparing both evolutions at @xmath42 , starting either from a 1s or a 2s state ) .",
    "we therefore interpret the transient phase as a re - equilibration of the @xmath3 d.o.f .",
    "leading to a mixed quantum state in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding qgp . from the comparison between the solid and the dashed curves on fig .",
    "[ fig : station ] , we realize that the stochastic forces are more efficient in destroying the @xmath43-like state at small @xmath30 and the screening tend to me more efficient at high @xmath30 . the largest suppression is obtained by combining both effects .     without friction nor stochastic forces , while dashed and thick lines correspond respectively to @xmath44 and @xmath45 with friction and stochastic forces.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "we now consider dynamical @xmath3 in genuine urhic , modeled by ideal fluid dynamics ensuing epos initial conditions  @xcite ( hereafter named as epos2 ) . for this purpose",
    ", we generate the initial positions of the @xmath3 pairs according to the glauber model .",
    "essential @xmath3 contributing to the production of final bound states are assumed to be global color - neutral states throughout the full evolution .",
    "the original center of mass momentum @xmath46 is thus preserved and @xmath3 pairs follow straight trajectories along which the temperature entering the sle ingredients is obtained from epos2 profiles , while the friction coefficient is evaluated from  @xcite at @xmath47 . typical time evolution",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epos_evol ] . in the left panel",
    ", we show the same information as in fig .",
    "[ fig : station ] , albeit with a more realistic initial @xmath3 state  a gaussian of width @xmath48 , adjusted to the @xmath49 ratio in pp .",
    "contrarily to the stationary medium case , one observes a saturation of the weights at large time , corresponding to the disappearance of the screening and to the freezing of the thermal forces .",
    "focusing on the @xmath50 , the evolution seems to be driven by the mf only , a feature that is obviously not generic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : station ] ) and deserves further investigation . for excited states ,",
    "the role of stochastic forces is crucial , as one can judge from the evolution of the @xmath51-like content : whereas these forces have the tendency to reduce it up to @xmath52 , they lead to a significant content afterwards ( as compared to the pure mf evolution ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as a continuous repopulation of the @xmath51-like content from the lowest lying states , an effect that is usually not correctly implemented in other approaches . on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : epos_evol ] , we explore the role of the initial state on the weights of @xmath24 and on the associated `` survival '' @xmath53 , defined as the ratio @xmath54 .",
    "we notice , in particular , that @xmath55 is much _ smaller _ if one initiates the @xmath3 state as a pure 2s state .",
    "this is due , once again , to the repopulation of higher states from the 1s if one starts from a gaussian wave packet . in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] , we present these survivals @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the last stage of the evolution  which correspond , in our model , to the nuclear modification factor @xmath58 measured in experiments  both as a function of bottomonia transverse momentum @xmath59 and as a function of the number of participant in the @xmath60 collision .",
    "global trends are found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements  @xcite , in particular the incomplete suppression of the @xmath43 ground state as well as the remarkably flat @xmath59 dependence .",

    "to conclude , this first study shows the promising features of the schrdinger - langevin equation applied to the topic of bottomonia suppression in urhic . notice that no feed down has been included in the present work , a lack which will be corrected in an upcoming review paper containing more detailed analysis .",
