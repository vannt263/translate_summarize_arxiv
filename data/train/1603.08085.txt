    "in the last @xmath13@xmath14 years , topological states of matter have been a topic of intense research with several reviews being written in this short span indicating the importance of this emerging frontier @xcite .",
    "while dirac @xcite and weyl fermions @xcite have been discovered in real materials , majorana fermions remain to be discovered .",
    "majorana fermions are sought after not only for their fundamental importance but also because of their possible application in topological quantum computing @xcite .",
    "there are several proposed candidate systems which might host majorana fermion zero modes .",
    "these include fractional quantum hall systems @xcite , unconventional superconductors @xcite , and heterostructures of topological insulators , semi - metals , or semiconductors with conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "topological superconductors have also been predicted to be avenues to host majorana fermions as emergent quasi - particles @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to study in detail the superconducting properties of various candidate topological superconductors .",
    "thus far there are three material systems shown to host superconductivity in a topological material : cu intercalated bi@xmath5se@xmath6 @xcite , the topological crystalline material sn@xmath15in@xmath4te @xcite , and pd intercalated bi@xmath5te@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "while there are now several studies reporting on the superconducting properties of the two material systems cu@xmath4bi@xmath5se@xmath6 @xcite and sn@xmath15in@xmath4te @xcite , there is only a single report on the occurrence of superconductivity in pd@xmath4bi@xmath5te@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "herein we report synthesis , electrical transport , and magnetic properties of this novel pd intercalated topological insulator bi@xmath5te@xmath6 .",
    "we confirm superconductivity with a critical temperature @xmath3  k. using temperature ( @xmath1 ) dependent resistivity ( @xmath16 ) measurements at various magnetic fields ( @xmath0 ) , and temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath17 ) measurements at various @xmath0 and pressure ( @xmath2 ) , we construct @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath2@xmath1 phase diagrams for superconductivity in this material .",
    "we find that the upper critical field versus temperature data show an upward curvature with decreasing temperature which has been observed for several unconventional superconductors",
    ". additionally , under pressure the @xmath11 is suppressed approximately linearly at a rate @xmath12  k / gpa .",
    "single crystals and polycrystalline samples of pd@xmath4bi@xmath5te@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) were grown using a bridgeman technique or by conventional solid state reaction , respectively .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of pd ( 4n ) , bi ( 5n ) , and te ( 5n ) were ground together , pelletized and sealed in a quartz tube under partial ar pressure . for crystal growth",
    "the tube was placed vertically in a box furnace and heated to 900@xmath18  c in 8  hrs , kept there for 10  hrs , then slowly cooled at a rate of @xmath19  c / hr to 650@xmath18  c after which the furnace was switched off and allowed to cool to ambient temperature . for polycrystalline samples ,",
    "two heat treatments at 900@xmath18  c for 24  hrs each with a regrind and pelletizing step in between , were used .",
    "the xrd patterns were obtained at room temperature using a rigaku geigerflex diffractometer with cu k@xmath20 radiation .",
    "chemical analysis was done using energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) on a jeol sem .",
    "electrical transport was measured using a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "magnetic susceptibility @xmath21 at various pressures @xmath22  gpa were measured using a cu - be pressure cell with the vsm option of a quantum design ppms .",
    "large shiny crystals could be easily cleaved from the as grown boule .",
    "chemical analysis gave the approximate chemical stoichimotery pd@xmath23bi@xmath5te@xmath6 which we will call pdbi@xmath5te@xmath6 .",
    "some crystals were crushed into powder for x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "the pxrd measurements shown in fig .  [ fig - xrd ] confirmed the majority phase to be bi@xmath5te@xmath6 with lattice parameters @xmath24  =  4.378(5 )  , @xmath25  =  30.499(7 )   which are close to those of bi@xmath5te@xmath6 ( @xmath24  =  4.375  ,",
    "@xmath25  =  30.385  ) but with a slightly enhanced @xmath25-axis parameter which is most likely due to pd intercalation between layers .",
    "we note that it is difficult to predict whether the lattice parameters will increase or decrease on intercalation , and by how much .",
    "we point to two examples of intercalated layered materials which become superconducting . for one material",
    "the lattice parameters increase on intercalation while for the other they decrease .",

    "this is consistent with the earlier report @xcite .",
    "we point out that none of the observed impurity phases are reported to superconduct above @xmath38  k and therefore do not interfere with our goal in the present work which is to study the effect of magnetic field and pressure on superconductivity in pdbi@xmath5te@xmath6 .",

    "in summary , we have synthesized single crystals and polycrystals of pd intercalated bi@xmath5te@xmath6 , confirmed the occurrence of superconductivity with a @xmath45  k , and studied the superconducting properties under magnetic field @xmath0 and externally applied pressure @xmath2 . the magnetic field - temperature ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) phase diagram extracted from both electrical transport and magnetic measurements",
    "show an upward curvature near @xmath11 as has been previously observed for several unconventional superconductors like high @xmath11 cuprates and organic superconductors @xcite as well as for the multi - gap superconductor mgb@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we tried to fit our @xmath0@xmath1 data using phenomenological models that have been used previously for conventional bcs type superconductors .",
    "figure  [ fig - ht ] shows results of our attempts to fit the @xmath0@xmath1 data obtained using the magnetic measurements described above with the expression @xmath53 $ ] , for fixed @xmath54 or @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the @xmath8 critical field .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - ht ] that the fit for @xmath57 is extremely poor and the fit for @xmath54 is satisfactory only at lower temperatures away from the @xmath48 critical temperature @xmath45  k. the @xmath56 obtained in these fits range approximately from @xmath58 to @xmath10  koe . if @xmath59 is allowed to vary as a fit parameter , the best fit is obtained for @xmath60 confirming the unconventional upward curvature .",
    "for example , the fit giving @xmath61 is shown as the solid curve through the @xmath0@xmath1 data obtained from the resistivity measurements .",
    "this @xmath62 behavior is unusual and suggests the possibility of unconventional superconductivity in pdbi@xmath5te@xmath6 .    additionally , from high pressure magnetic measurements we found that @xmath11 is suppressed to lower temperatures approximately linearly with pressure @xmath2 at a rate @xmath12  k / gpa .",
    "this suppression of @xmath11 with pressure is expected for conventional electron - phonon mediated superconductivity and occurs due to the stiffening of the lattice with pressure .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath2@xmath1 phase diagrams therefore give seemingly conflicting results about the nature ( conventional or unconventional ) of superconductivity in pdbi@xmath5te@xmath6 .",
    "we note that mgb@xmath5 also shows such conflicting behaviors @xcite .",
    "mgb@xmath5 is an electron - phonon mediated superconductor and hence its @xmath11 decreases with pressure @xmath2 .",
    "the unconventional upward curvature in its @xmath0@xmath1 phase diagram most likely arises due to its two - gap nature .",
    "the reason for such behavior in pdbi@xmath5te@xmath6 is not understood at present .",
