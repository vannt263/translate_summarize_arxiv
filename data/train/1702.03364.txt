    "the development of lattice basis reduction began in 1773 by l. lagrange @xcite , c. f. gauss @xcite , c. hermite @xcite ( 1850 ) , a. korkin and y. r. zolotarev @xcite ( 1873 ) , h. minkowski@xcite ( 1896 ) , and b. l. van der waerden @xcite ( 1956 ) .",
    "the hermite , korkin , zolotarev ( hkz @xcite ) lattice basis reduction method is assumed to be the strongest but impractical reduction approach . in 1982 , arjen lenstra , hendrik lenstra and lszl lovsz @xcite , introduced a polynomial time basis reduction algorithm to factor a rational polynomial , presently known as lll , that approximates the _ shortest vector _ within a factor of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the rank of the lattice .",
    "thus , lll is fast but weak due to the large approximation factor . in @xmath4 l. babai @xcite , proposed an algorithm that approximates the _ closest vector _ to a lattice point by a factor of @xmath5 in @xmath6 c. p. schnorr @xcite proposed a further refinement of the lll algorithm that improved the shortest vector approximation factor to @xmath7 the _ block korkin zolotarev _ ( bkz ) algorithm was introduced and studied @xcite by babai and schnorr respectively . in 1993 ,",
    "m. seysen @xcite showed that each full rank @xmath3 lattice @xmath8 has a basis @xmath0 and an associated basis @xmath9 of the reciprocal lattice @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this was an improvement on the relation @xmath14 established by j. hastard and j. c. lagarias @xcite . in 1994 ,",
    "schnorr and euchner @xcite introduced improved algorithms for bkz and _ deep insertion _ , but the runtime of these algorithms is not polynomial .    in 2001 , m. ajtai et al . , @xcite introduced a _ sieve _",
    "algorithm for the shortest lattice vector problem . in @xmath15",
    "_ n. gama and p. nguyen _",
    "@xcite observed experimentally that bkz s practical runtime seems to grow exponentially with lattice dimension . in 2010 , o. dagdelen and m. schneider , @xcite presented a parallel version of the lattice enumeration algorithm using a multi - core cpu system .",
    "the shortest vector ( svp ) and closest vector ( cvp ) problems , presently considered intractable , are algorithmic tasks that lie at the core of many number theoretic problems , integer programming , finding irreducible factors of polynomials , minimal polynomials of algebraic numbers , and simultaneous diophantine approximation .",
    "lattice basis reduction also has deep and extensive connections with modern cryptography , and cryptanalysis particularly in the post - quantum era . at present",
    ", lattice based cryptosystem do not appear to be vulnerable to quantum attacks . also , the implementation of a lattice based cryptosystem is faster than the rsa or ecc system at an equivalent security level which is proposed in papers by t. gneysu et.al . in 2012 ,",

    "a. shamir @xcite proposed a polynomial - time algorithm for breaking the basic merkle - hellman cryptosystem . in 1985 , j. c. lagarias and a. m. odlyzko , @xcite solved low density knapsack problems . in 1996 , hoffstein et al .",
    ", @xcite proposed ntru : a ring theory based public key cryptosystem . in 1997 , d. coppersmith @xcite published a paper on small solutions to polynomial equations , and low exponent rsa vulnerabilities . in this paper ,",
    "coppersmith showed how to find small integer solutions to a modular polynomial in a single variable and extended the method to the multivariate case . in 1997 , m. ajtai and c. dwork @xcite designed a probabilistic public key cryptosystem whose security relies on the hardness of lattice problems .",
    "their cryptosystem is quite impractical because of the massive data expansion , as it encrypts data bit - by - bit .    inspired by the ajtai - dwork cryptosystem , o. goldreich et .",
    "al . , @xcite proposed a public key cryptosystem based on the closest vector problem in a lattice , and j .- y .",
    "cai and t. w. cusick , @xcite introduced similar work on a lattice based public key cryptosystem in 1999 . in 2001 , c. gentry , @xcite published a paper on key recovery and message attacks on ntru - composite , where he recovers information about the private key used in ntru .  in 2001 , d. coppersmith and a. shamir , @xcite proposed a new lattice basis reduction technique to cryptanalyze the ntru scheme . in 2009 , craig gentry , @xcite , in his ph.d .",
