    "three years after the first identification of the x - ray afterglow from a gamma ray burst ( grb ) ( costa et al . , 1997 ) , the nature of gamma ray bursts progenitors remains uncertain .",
    "the most widely discussed theoretical models for grbs consider vastly different scenarios both in terms of the progenitors and environment .",
    "if the grbs originate from neutron star - neutron star or neutron star - black hole mergers ( narayan , paczynski and piran 1992 ) then , for about a half of all grbs , the explosion should be located far from the place where the progenitor binary system was formed and most probably in a low - density interstellar medium . on the other hand , if grbs originate from hypernovae ( paczynski , 1998 ; woosley , 1993 ) or supranovae ( vietri & stella , 1998 ) , the immediate progenitor is a massive , rotating star , and thus the explosion should take place in a high density medium , probably a star - forming region .",
    "the discovery of emission lines in the x - ray spectrum of a grb afterglow represents a major step toward the understanding of the nature of grb progenitors .",
    "in fact , the measurement of x - ray lines emitted by a grb or its afterglow provides a direct measurement of the redshift and a powerful diagnostic of both the nature of the central engine and the environment in which grbs go off ( perna & loeb , 1998 ; mszros & rees , 1998 ; bttcher et al . , 1999 ,",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    ", 1999 ; paerels et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "other methods , such as collecting offsets between grbs afterglow and their host galaxies ( bloom et al . , 1999 ) or searching for absorbing material between the grb and the observer ( wijers & galama , 1999 ; owens et al . , 1999 ) , are comparatively less direct .",
    "presently , there are only two marginal detections of an x - ray emission line in grb afterglows , one in grb 970508 ( chance probability for a statistical fluctuation of 0.7% , piro et al .",
    "1999 ) and one in grb 970828 ( probability of 1.7% , yoshida et al .",
    "the presence of a strong iron line in the x - ray spectrum of a grb afterglow implies a rich environment located very close to the grb region and may be an important clue in favor of collapsar models ( mszros & rees , 1998 ; lazzati , campana , & ghisellini , 1999 ; weth et al . , 2000 ;",
    "vietri et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , in the case of the hypernova scenario an iron rich circumburst environment may be produced by the stellar wind before the explosion of the hypernova ( mszros & rees , 1998 ) .",
    "a similarly favorable situation occurs in the supranova scenario ( vietri & stella , 1998 ) where a supernova explosion precedes by a few months the grb event .",
    "grb 000214 ( `` valentine s day burst '' ) has no optical nor near - infrared afterglow ( rhoads et al .",
    ", 2000 ; wijers et al . , in preparation ) as is the case for about half of all grbs with follow  up observations ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the lack of optical and ir counterparts to a grb may result from extinction in a dense surrounding medium ; therefore , searching for emission lines in the x - ray afterglows of these grbs looks especially promising .",
    "based on a bepposax pointed observation of grb 000214 , we report on the detection of an iron k@xmath2 line from its x - ray afterglow .",
    "grb 000214 was detected both by the gamma ray burst monitor ( grbm ) and wide field cameras ( wfc ) on - board bepposax on 2000 feb .",
    "14 01:01:01 ut . the prompt event , i.e. the gamma ray emission detected by grbm , lasted @xmath8  s and had a fluence of @xmath9=@xmath10 erg @xmath11 in the 40700 kev band . the corresponding prompt x - ray emission detected by wfc had a fluence of @xmath9=@xmath12 erg @xmath11 ( 210 kev ) . in the x - rays a complex multi - peaked structure lasting about 2 min after the burst proper",
    "was clearly seen ; a detailed analysis of the early behaviour of grb 000214 will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the evolution of the x to gamma - ray spectrum from the prompt event showed a spectral softening similar to that observed in other grbs ( frontera et al .",
    ", 1998 , 2000a , 2000b ) .      a follow - up observation with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfi ) began about 12 hours after the burst and lasted about 104,000 s. the effective exposure time was 51,000 s on source time for the bepposax medium energy concetrator / spectrometer ( mecs ) , and 15,000 s in the low energy concentrator / spectrometer ( lecs ) .",
    "a previously unknown x - ray source , 1sax j1854.4 - 6627 , was detected in the mecs and lecs field of view at a position of ra = @xmath13 and dec = @xmath14 ( j2000 ) ( uncertainty radius of 50  ) .",
    "the source position lies within the wfc error circle ( paolino et al . ,",
    "2000 ; antonelli , 2000 ) and ipn error box ( hurley & feroci , 2000 ) . the 210 kev flux of 1sax j1854.4 - 6627 decreased by a factor of about two , from @xmath15 ( first 11 ks ) to @xmath16 ( last 10 ks ) , during the bepposax observation ( these fluxes were derived by using the best fit model to the spectra , see next section ) . in consideration of its fading behaviour and position within both the wfc and ipn error boxes",
    ", we concluded that 1sax j1854.4 - 6627 represents the afterglow of grb  000214 .",
    "the mecs lightcurve yields a flux decay ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath18 ( hereafter all errors are quoted at 90% confidence level for one parameter of interest ) .",
    "combining the mecs lightcurve with the wfc lightcurve from after the main event ( extending for 39 s after burst onset ) yields a flux decay with a power - law slope of @xmath19 .",
    "this slope is somewhat steeper than usually observed in grb x - ray afterglows ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we extracted the lecs(0.1 - 4.0 kev ) and mecs(1.6 - 10.0 kev ) spectra of the source from the entire bepposax observation ( figure 1 ) using standard procedures ( fiore et al .",
    "the extraction regions were chosen so as to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "an accurate analysis of local background was performed in order to check for spurious features .",
    "after having verified that the local background is compatible with that derived from blank field observations available at the bepposax science data center , we used the latter in order to achieve a background subtraction with improved signal to noise ( see also figure 2 ) .",
    "both the lecs and mecs spectra were binned so as to have at least 15 photons per bin .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using the xspec10.0 package .",
    "we checked that our results are nearly insensitive to the details of the background subtraction .",
    "we first fit the data with a power - law plus photoelectric absorption .",
    "the relative normalization of lecs versus mecs was left free to vary in the 0.7 - 1.0 range ( fiore , 1999 ) .",
    "we obtained a best - fit value of @xmath21 for 14 ( d.o.f . ) .",
    "the column density best - fit value ( @xmath22 @xmath11 ) is compatible with the galactic value @xmath23 @xmath11 ( dickey & lockman , 1990 ) , so we fixed it to this value .",
    "we obtained a power - law photon index of @xmath24 and a flux of @xmath25 .",
    "the best - fit value was @xmath26 for 15 ( d.o.f . ) .",
    "these relatively high chisquare values ( corresponding to a chance probability of @xmath27 in the latter case ) justified a deeper analysis .",
    "the residuals to the fit above show a clear excess around energies of @xmath28  kev which can be interpreted as an emission line ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we added a narrow ( with respect to mecs energy resolution , which is @xmath29e / e=8@xmath30(e/6 kev)@xmath31 fwhm% ) gaussian line to the previous model in order to fit the observed feature .",
    "we inferred in this way a line centroid energy of @xmath32 kev and an intensity of @xmath33 photons @xmath11 s@xmath34 , translating into an e.w .",
    "of @xmath35  kev .",
    "the best fit chisquare value was @xmath36 for 13 d.o.f .",
    "applying an @xmath37test to assess the statistical significance of the gaussian feature we obtained a chance probability of 0.27% ( corresponding to @xmath38 significance level ) .",
    "the other spectral parameters were only marginally affected by the inclusion of the gaussian , with a power - law photon index of @xmath39 and a flux of @xmath40 .",
    "the lecs normalization relative to the mecs depends mainly on the source position in the lecs and the different exposure intervals than the mecs ( note that the source was fading ) .",
    "however the statistical uncertainty we determined for this normalization was greater than the nominal range ; therefore we also fixed it to 0.8 , the value inferred from a bepposax observation of ngc 7469 ( piro 1999b ) , a seyfert 1 galaxy with a @xmath41  kev spectrum similar to that of the grb 000214 afterglow .",
    "the best fit chisquare value was @xmath42 for 16 d.o.f .",
    "fitting data with the simple power - law model and @xmath43 for 14 d.o.f . adding a gaussian line to the previous model . following this procedure , while the spectral parameters remain essentially unchanged a slightly improved statistical significance ( @xmath37test ) was obtained for the fit with the power  law and gaussian line ( chance probability of 0.15% , or @xmath44 ) .",
    "we divided the mecs observation in two consecutive intervals ( 20 ks and 30 ks exposure ) .",
    "mecs spectra were extracted from each interval by the same method as above . as shown in figure 3",
    "both spectra show evidence for an emission line at an energy compatible , within the errors , with the line detected during the entire observation .",
    "note also that most of the flux decrease in the second part of the observation seems due to the continuum rather than the line .",
    "poor statistics does not allow a more quantitative investigation .",
    "the only cosmologically abundant element that can produce lines beyond 4 kev is iron , provided one precludes doppler shifts to shorter wavelengths .",
    "iron emits a k@xmath2 line photons with an energy between 6.4 ( for the lower ionization stages of iron ) and 6.95 kev ( for hydrogen - like iron ) .",
    "the observed feature may be also interpreted as the iron recombination k  edge at 9.28 kev ( corresponding to a redshift of @xmath45 ) but , in such a case , according to weth et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we should expect both a fe k  edge and a k@xmath2 line having about the same intensity .",
    "the fe - k@xmath2 line should be redshifted at an energy between 3.2 and 3.5 kev but no line is detected in the mecs spectrum of grb 000214 afterglow within this range . if we identify the emission feature in grb 000214 as fe k@xmath2 , the corresponding redshift is between @xmath46 and 0.47 .",
    "we will assume @xmath47 for simplicity , but none of the following discussion hinges upon this exact value .",
    "the case of grb 000214 differs from that of grb 970508 in two ways .",
    "first , the iron line is more significant in grb 000214 : we find that the probability of a chance fluctuation is @xmath48 , as compared to @xmath49 .",
    "this difference becomes even more remarkable when one considers that there is no independent determination of the redshift for grb 000214 , while grb 970508 has @xmath50 from optical observations ( metzger et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "second , the afterglow observation of grb 000214 did not allow detection of a possible reburst , contrary to grb 970508 .",
    "in fact , grb 000214 was observed just once after the burst proper , beginning @xmath51 h after the main event , and for a total of @xmath52 s. grb 970508 , instead , was observed on four different occasions after the burst , beginning @xmath53 h after the main event , with the last set of observations more than @xmath53 days after the burst ( piro et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "thus , for grb 000214 , we have no time coverage to exclude a reburst before or after the time of our observations : all we can say is that , during this limited time , the flux decreased by about a factor of @xmath54 ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "this is consistent with grb 970508 , where the line was bright as the flux was decreasing ( fig .",
    "2a of piro et al . , 1999 ) ; thus the model of vietri et al . ( 1999 ) , connecting the appearance of the iron line to the reburst , is still viable .    for @xmath55 , @xmath56 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 , and @xmath57 , we find a total energy release , in the line only , of @xmath58 erg , i.e. @xmath59 photons emitted within the first @xmath60 s after the burst ; the emission is isotropic because the line is sub  relativistic . if each iron atom were to emit a single line photon , then @xmath61 , way too large .",
    "thus each iron atom must produce several line photons ( lazzati , 1999 ) , and , consequently , the time ",
    "scale @xmath62 over which every iron atom produces a photon satisfies @xmath63 s , and does not seem to begin fading .",
    "this implies that the time ",
    "scale @xmath64 is set by the geometrical factor : the line  emitting material must be located at @xmath65 cm , and we are seeing some sizeable fraction of it .",
    "the minimum iron mass is determined by lazzati ( 1999 ) as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the line luminosity in units of @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the line duration in units of @xmath70 s , @xmath71 the material distance in units of @xmath72 cm , @xmath73 is the fraction of the absorbed ionizing fluence and reprocessed into the line ( @xmath74 as derived by ghisellini et al . , 1999 ) and @xmath75 is the total x  ray burst luminosity in units of @xmath76 erg ; for grb 000214 we find @xmath77 if the burst emission were isotropic . with these values",
    "@xmath78    this argues against a possible origin of this grb in a neutron star - neutron star ( or neutron star - black hole ) binary merger .",
    "the problem is not one of total iron content of the model : for realistic parameters , this scenario can easily satisfy the above limit .",
    "the problem lies instead in the capacity of the model to deposit this much iron at these large distances , and at newtonian speeds .",
    "in fact , under our assumption that the line is not blueshifted ( at least , its lorenz factor is @xmath79 ) , the iron can not have been released in the burst event itself : there is not time enough for matter ejected in the explosion to rush ahead of photons , slow down , and then be hit by the burst flash .",
    "the material generating the line must have been released well before the burst .",
    "given their lack of atmospheres and winds , the only mechanism capable of releasing matter from inspiralling neutron stars is tidal interaction .",
    "a mass loss estimate for this process by mszros and rees ( 1992 ) has a lower limit of @xmath80 , enough to account ( barely ! ) for eq .",
    "[ iron ] , but this optimistically assumes that the typical viscosity damping time - scale equals the light travel time across the star ( bildsten and cutler 1992 ) . though the exact amount of viscosity in a neutron star is not well  known , theoretical arguments fall short of the amount required for the correctness of the estimate by mszros and rees ( 1992 ) , by about a factor @xmath81 ( kochanek 1992 , eq .",
    "4.7 , bildsten and cutler 1992 , see the discussions after eq . 9 and 16 ) .    in hypernova models , an intense wind should characterize the massive progenitor before the collapse .",
    "calling @xmath82 the iron mass fraction relative to the solar abundance ( lang 1991 , p. 84 ) , we expect from eq .",
    "2 a minimum mass of @xmath83 the radial mass distribution from a massive stellar wind is @xmath84",
    ". the most extreme ratios of stellar wind mass loss rate @xmath85 to asymptotic speed @xmath86 occur in luminous blue variables and red supergiant variables ( @xmath87 yr@xmath34 , @xmath88 km s@xmath34 , lamers , 1995 , van loon et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "for these winds , at @xmath89  cm there can only be @xmath90 , missing the above lower limit by @xmath91 orders of magnitude .",
    "the densest circumstellar envelopes around the progenitors of some peculiar core collapse supernovae ( _ e.g. _ @xmath92  @xmath93 at @xmath94  cm in sn1997ab , salamanca et al",
    ". , 1998 ) imply a mass of @xmath95 , substantially lower than required by eq .",
    "a model immune from these inconsistencies is the supranova , where a core collapse supernova explosion precedes the grb event by months to years ( vietri and stella 1998 ) .    on the other hand , the lack of large amounts of material along the line of sight , as testified by the absence of photoelectric soft x - ray absorption on top of the galactic value @xmath11 , for the non ",
    "galactic column density , corresponds to a total mass , within @xmath51 light hours , of @xmath96 , which could indicate a large amount of mass only for implausibly large ( @xmath97 ) ionization fractions . ] , and the development of a normal x  ray afterglow , clearly suggest the presence of outlying material located in the progenitor s equatorial plane , at large angles from the line of sight",
    ". this material may be either left over from the progenitor s formation process ( as in a primordial gas cloud ) or spewed out by the progenitor .",
    "key future observations capable of discriminating between these possibilities will be the measurement of the line width , and a search of atomic species produced in the interiors of evolved stars .",
    "velocities of @xmath98 can rule out any primordial cloud and/or hypernovae winds ; the detection of cobalt or nickel may establish the recent origin of the material from a sn explosion .",
