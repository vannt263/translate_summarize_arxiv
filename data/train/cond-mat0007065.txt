    "the observation that a number of different types of astronomical objects appear to be in thermodynamically relaxed states has motivated theorists to understand the thermodynamics and statistical physics of self - gravitating systems .",
    "of particular note are the globular clusters , consisting of about a million stars . besides having relaxed cores",
    ", these structures appear to be organized in two distinct classes characterized by radically different density profiles , x - ray production , and other features.@xcite this suggests that globular clusters may exist in different thermodynamic phases .",
    "however , in contrast with normal  chemical  systems , which have been successfully described by thermodynamics at the macroscopic level , both the infinite range and short distance singularity of the newtonian gravitational potential introduce problems in the statistical theory of phase transitions which make their analysis a challenging task . the description of the system can be simplified by going to the vlasov limit , i.e. by letting the number of particles become large while controlling the total mass , m , and energy , e. in this limit the system is described by the single particle density @xmath0 in the @xmath1 ( position , velocity ) space , which is employed by most of the standard treatments , including the present work.@xcite we refer to this reduced description as mean field theory ( mft ) . while mft avoids the problem of dealing with an n body formulation , the difficulties introduced by the singularity and long range of the potential persist .    in the early sixties antonov investigated the equilibrium behavior of isolated gravitational systems in mft.@xcite to circumvent the problem of escape , he confined the mass to a finite region by introducing a rigid wall . by fixing the total mass and energy , he showed that maximum entropy solutions for @xmath2 are spherically symmetric in position and have the expected maxwellian velocity dependence .",
    "however , he proved that there is no _ global _ maximum to the entropy : while extremal solutions can exist , these are at best _ local _ maxima .",
    "antonov @xcite , as well as lynden - bell and wood @xcite , closely investigated the spherically symmetric system confined in a sphere and showed that when the mass and energy are fixed there are no entropy extrema above a critical radius ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "when the radius is less than this value , the stability of the extremum solutions were studied by several authors ( lynden - bell and katz @xcite , katz @xcite @xcite , padmanabhan @xcite @xcite , and bavaud @xcite ) .",
    "they found that , in general , above a critical density contrast ( @xmath4 ) all extrema are unstable , i.e. they are not _ local _ maxima .",
    "lynden - bell and wood coined this phenomena the _ gravothermal catastrophe _ and it is also referred to as the antonov instability .",
    "in such a system , there is no upper bound on the entropy and @xmath5a state of arbitrarily large entropy can be constructed from a centrally concentrated density profile by shifting more of the mass towards the center ( core - halo structures have higher entropy ) .",
    "more recently , kiessling has investigated the thermodynamic stability of the full n body point mass system confined in a spherical box using the canonical ensemble . to avoid the short range singularity he regularized the newtonian interaction by softening it ( letting the potential approach a finite value as the origin is closely approached ) .",
    "he showed that in the limit that the softening vanishes ( newtonian interaction ) , the canonical equilibrium measure is the superposition of dirac measures at any temperature , meaning that the system is in a collapsed point mass state .",
    "we have to emphasize that this is the equilibrium solution when the system is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath .",
    "also , based on the results of the finite n - particle system , with proper scaling of the particle mass as we take the mean - field limit , he showed that the single - particle density function is proportional to the dirac distribution .",
    "therefore the system s equilibrium state is the collapsed state in the canonical ensemble .",
    "kiessling s conclusions do not contradict the earlier work applying mft to the microcanonical ensemble ( fixed mass and energy ) described above , since no global entropy maximum was found in that case either .",
    "in fact , the pure newtonian potential is never a correct picture in general because of the finite size of stars and atoms . in a nearly hidden appendix of their paper describing the gravothermal catastrophe ,",
    "it was first pointed out by lynden - bell and wood that if we modify the singular @xmath6 newtonian gravitational potential at the center by introducing a small minimal distance between the particles ( the so called hard - sphere model ) that complete collapse would be avoided and a global entropy maximum should exist .",
    "@xcite they further conjectured that in this situation a first order phase transition to a centrally concentrated core - halo configuration would occur as the system energy is reduced .",
    "several authors demonstrated the existence of a phase - transition in special mean - field models with a modified gravitational potential .",
    "hertel and thirring @xcite were the first to show analytically that a gravitating system can undergo a first - order phase transition .",
    "although their system is not purely gravitational and has no singularity , the pair - interaction potential is purely attractive and has a fixed value when the pair of particles are in a given sub - domain . also lynden - bell and lynden - bell@xcite showed the occurrence of a first - order phase transition in their special gravitational system , consisting of point particles distributed on a shell which can not shrink into a point mass ( inner boundary ) or expand to infinity ( outer boundary ) .",
    "kiessling et .",
    "al . also applied the hard - sphere model @xcite to study planet formation : they were able to explain the existence of observable planets by showing that the mass belonging to the condensed phase is well below the jeans mass.@xcite for finite n - body systems , a gravitational first - order phase transition was first observed dynamically by youngkins and miller @xcite .",
    "they investigated a model consisting of irrotational , concentric , spherical mass shells confined between two rigid spherical boundaries .",
    "the system was studied both theoretically in the mean - field limit and numerically by n - body simulations in the microcanonical , canonical , and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "the analysis for this one dimensional system showed that the system undergoes a first - order phase transition instead of a gravothermal catastrophe . as expected in gravitational systems",
    ", there were some discrepancies in the results for different ensembles ; however the numerical n - shell simulations were always in good agreement with the corresponding mean - field predictions .",
    "much earlier , eddington @xcite determined the form of the general stationary solution of the vlasov equation for a spherical system with an anisotropic velocity distribution which obeys the schwarzschild law @xcite .",
    "this model explicitly depends on the square of the angular momenta @xmath7 , but it also includes the isothermal part : @xmath8 .",
    "the model was presented much earlier , but it may have been forgotten . later , several phenomenological models were improved by including eddington s anisotropic term ( king - michie models and others @xcite @xcite @xcite ) , giving a better fit to the observed density profiles of globular clusters . however , in some cases , a good fit was not obtained for globular clusters with core - halo structures . in other words , a fair number of globular clusters which have a small and very dense core surrounded by a thin halo structure , do not obey these empirical density - fit models . on the other hand , in addition to the system energy , the sum of the angular momenta squares @xmath9 is also an integral of the motion for any isolated spherically symmetric system in the mean - field limit @xcite , and should not be ignored .",
    "the purpose of our work is to present a more general approach for investigating the equilibrium properties of confined , spherical , systems then those of antonov , lynden - bell and wood , etc .",
    "mentioned above which takes into account both integrals of a spherical gravitating system , and to introduce idealized dynamical  shell  models which also satisfy these constraints .",
    "model gravitating systems consisting of a collection of concentric , infinitesimally thin , spherical shells were first introduced by henon @xcite .",
    "they are useful for investigating the initial stages of evolution of a spherically symmetric self gravitating system , before the onset of binary formation arising from three body effects .",
    "@xcite they have the further advantages of ease and accuracy of algorithm construction , since it is possible to analytically solve for the motion of each shell between encounters , eliminating the need for the tedious and slow , step - wise integration of coupled , nonlinear , differential equations .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite .    in the present work we consider the mean field theory of a system of gravitating point particles moving in three dimensional space , as well as that of thin , rotating , spherical mass shells with angular momentum vectors restricted to manifolds of one , two and three dimensions .",
    "we first determine conditions for the equilibrium one particle probability density function @xmath10of a unit mass particle ( shell ) by finding the entropy extrema with respect to the constraints of ( 1 ) the normalization , ( 2 ) system energy @xmath11 , and ( 3 ) the sum of the squares of the angular momentum , @xmath12 .",
    "we then show that the introduction of the new integral @xmath12 suggests a new type of canonical ensemble ( @xmath13 , in addition to the extension of the microcanonical ensemble ( @xmath14 . a nonlinear differential equation governing the radial density valid for each ensemble is derived for the case of the three dimensional point mass system , and each shell system .",
    "we then prove that the radial density of the shell system with angular momentum confined to the euclidean plane satisfies the identical differential equation as the three dimensional point mass system , and we carefully study the equilibrium solutions for this case numerically .",
    "the stability of the extremum solutions of each model is investigated in both microcanonical ( @xmath14 and canonical ( @xmath13 ensembles . at first glance",
    "it is natural to anticipate that the centrifugal barrier associated with the additional constraint will eliminate any tendency for complete core collapse without introducing an inner boundary in the system or changing the gravitational potential by other means .",
    "we conclude by investigating the possible presence of a phase - transition which would remove the gravothermal catastrophe .",
    "the primary goal is to evaluate the equilibrium single particle probability density function @xmath15 which maximizes the entropy in the mean - field limit .",
    "consider the spherically symmetric isolated point mass system in three space dimensions with total mass @xmath16 confined in a sphere of radius @xmath17 .",
    "we choose units where @xmath18 and introduce spherical coordinates @xmath19 .",
    "the lagrangian per unit mass of a single particle moving in the mean field potential @xmath20 ( [ pot ] ) is @xmath21 where , for a newtonian pair - wise interaction , @xmath22 is given by :    @xmath23 f\\left ( x^{/},p^{/}\\right ) d^{3}x^{/}d^{3}p^{/ } , \\label{pot}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and , as usual , @xmath25 denotes the heavyside step function .",
    "the hamiltonian is then @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the corresponding canonical momenta .",
    "our plan is first to construct the entropy extrema , and then verify whether or not the solutions are local maxima .",
    "the entropy of the system is@xcite@xcite @xmath28 and the constraints for which we need to find the extremum are : ( 1 ) normalization of @xmath2 , ( 2 ) energy conservation in the complete system , and ( 3 ) conservation of @xmath12 : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 where    @xmath32    introducing lagrange multipliers @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 we have an extremum for the functional @xmath36 when @xmath37 taking the first variation of each term in ( [ extremum ] ) , and asserting ( [ norm ] ) , ( [ e ] ) , ( [ l2 ] ) , and ( [ pot ] ) , we obtain : @xmath38 + \\gamma l^{2}\\right\\ } \\delta fd^{3}xd^{3}p\\ ] ] from which finally @xmath39 thus the one - particle probability density function ( pdf ) is @xmath40 ..   \\label{3dpointdensity}\\ ] ] in order to obtain the radial density @xmath41 , we have to integrate @xmath2 over the other variables . to ensure that the integrals over @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 converge , the following conditions are necessary:@xmath45 and @xmath46 at any @xmath47 .",
    "therefore the second condition is @xmath48 .",

    ", it s more convenient to use the linear ( radial ) density instead of the volume density : @xmath54 note that because @xmath55 , the radial probability density function and the linear mass density function are the same . introducing a new function @xmath56 and employing [ 3dpointmassdens ]",
    "we can rewrite ( [ poisson ] ) as @xmath57 obtaining a closed equation for @xmath58 this in turn can be simplified by introducing constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 this is the final form of the differential equation for the scaled potential which we will solve using numerical methods . finally , we can evaluate @xmath11 , @xmath64 , and @xmath36 in terms of the lagrange multipliers , the density @xmath65 , and the potential @xmath66 after integrating ( [ e ] ) , ( [ l2 ] ) , and ( [ pointentropy ] ) , we obtain : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69      in this section we consider the system of spherically symmetric , infinitesimally thin , mass shells confined in a sphere with radius @xmath70 we can define three basic types of the model with dimensions @xmath71 .",
    "the one - dimensional @xmath72 non - rotating shell system is discussed in @xcite . in the @xmath73 case",
    ", every shell rotates about a fixed axis .",
    "when @xmath74 the rotational axis of every shell is in a fixed plane , while @xmath75 means that every shell can rotate about any arbitrary axis .",
    "therefore we use @xmath76 angles as coordinates .",
    "let us consider these systems in the mean - field limit again using units where @xmath77 .",
    "with the potential discussed above ( [ pot ] ) , the lagrangian and the hamiltonian of a unit mass shell in a spherical coordinate system are , respectively , : @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath81 are the angles around @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 the @xmath85 are the @xmath86 components of the angular momentum per unit mass , and we have used the fact that the moment of inertia of a shell with unit mass is @xmath87 in the equations above , we use @xmath88 which is the number of degrees of freedom coming only from rotation .",
    "this is a generalization of the previous model , and so is the method to find the equilibrium pdf , @xmath15 . as in the previous section , in order to get the equilibrium solutions first we have to find the extremum of the entropy : @xmath89 with respect to the three constraints of normalization , @xmath90 and @xmath91@xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 the solution for the variational problem can be obtained easily , and the one - particle density function is now @xmath95 \\exp \\left [ -\\beta \\left (   \\frac{1}{2}v^{2}+\\phi \\right ) \\right ] \\exp \\left [ -\\left ( \\frac{3\\beta } { % 4r^{2}}+\\gamma \\right ) \\sum_{k=1}^{n}l_{k}^{2}\\right ] . \\label{nshelldensity}\\ ] ] therefore the radial mass density function is @xmath96 from the poisson equation , again using using @xmath97 we find , @xmath98 which can be simplified to @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101    comparing the results ( [ nshellfinal ] ) for the 3 dimensional shell system ( @xmath102 ) to that of a 3 dimensional point mass system ( [ 3dpointfinal ] ) , we can see that these two systems are equivalent in so far as ( [ 3dpointfinal ] ) and ( [ nshellfinal ] ) have the same form .",
    "it is useful to evaluate @xmath103 and @xmath11 in terms of the lagrange multipliers , @xmath41 , and @xmath66 the integration of ( [ nshells ] ) , ( [ nshelll2 ] ) , and ( [ nshelle ] ) yields @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106",
    "in the previous sections we derived expressions for the entropy extremum solutions for our model systems in terms of the local radial density . a third lagrange multiplier,@xmath35 , was introduced to satisfy the new constraint on @xmath12 @xmath108 thus specifying @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( and , of course , @xmath109 ) defines the analogue to the microcanonical ensemble for these systems .",
    "alternatively , by fixing @xmath110 and @xmath35 , we can define the analogue of the canonical ensemble , in which @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not fixed , but their average is determined by @xmath110 and @xmath35 , where @xmath111 .",
    "we call this the @xmath112 ensemble",
    ". it can be modeled by imagining that the system is in contact with a heat bath with constant @xmath110 and also an @xmath7 bath at constant @xmath35 .",
    "the new @xmath113 bath corresponds to the fact that we allow some @xmath7 exchange between the system and the bath . since the system is spherically symmetric in position , while the system can also exchange angular momentum with the bath , its vector average will vanish . as an example , we can imagine a globular cluster which is embedded in some large spherically symmetric stellar neighborhood with an isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "the mean angular momentum of both system and bath is zero , and only @xmath7 and energy exchange can occur ( for the moment , we do not take into account the possibility that particles can escape from the cluster ) .    in performing calculations",
    "it is more convenient to use the @xmath112 ensemble than the @xmath114 microcanonical ensemble because in the latter we have to find the lagrange multipliers from the given @xmath11 and @xmath12 . as can be seen from [ 3dpointentropy ] , [ 3dpointl2 ] , and [ 3dpointe ] this is a nontrivial and laborious task . in this ensemble",
    "the relevant thermodynamic potential is an extension of the helmholz free energy : @xmath115 and equilibrium states , if they exist , minimize @xmath116",
    "from the variational problem , we only know the extremum solutions . in order to separate the unstable solutions from the locally stable , we use the modified method of poincare s linear series of equilibria . following katz , @xcite@xcite we can generalize the method to the case of a functional . from now on ,",
    "we discuss the generalized version of the method which has to be applied to our models to determine whether an extremum solution is stable or unstable .",
    "we outline the method below .",
    "let s assume that we want to find the maximum of the functional @xmath117 which depends parametrically on @xmath118 the function @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a compact domain @xmath121 , and the local maximum of the functional is the stable solution .",
    "suppose we partition @xmath122 and consider the vector @xmath123 with elements @xmath124 ( @xmath125 is not a coordinate but an indexed element in @xmath120 ) . instead of dealing with the functional @xmath126 , we can construct a function @xmath127 such that @xmath128 .",
    "the accuracy can be controlled by refining the partition ( increasing n ) . the problem is then shifted to finding the extrema of @xmath129 : @xmath130 denote the extremum solutions of the problem by @xmath131 where @xmath132 , labels different extremal solutions .",
    "assume that the first and second derivatives of @xmath129 are continuous in @xmath133 and @xmath134 and @xmath135 is continuous as well .",
    "assume also that the matrix @xmath136 has a non - degenerate eigenvalue spectrum , which we may consider to be ordered : @xmath137 . .",
    ".@xmath138 ... , and further that @xmath136 is diagonal .",
    "( we can always transform it into that form . ) .",
    "let s evaluate @xmath129 at the extremum points @xmath139 where @xmath140 then , as the parameter @xmath141 is varied , on the extremum labeled @xmath142 , @xmath143 @xmath144 the stability of the extremum is determined by the second derivative of @xmath145 , @xmath146 the stability will change only when one of the @xmath147 changes sign , and a change in stability occurs only at bifurcation or limit points @xcite @xcite .",
    "therefore we have to investigate the dependence of @xmath148 on @xmath141 in order to decide how the stability changes at an @xmath149 bifurcation or limit point .",
    "if we look at ( [ stability ] ) , one can see that when a particular @xmath150 changes sign from positive to negative , at that point @xmath151 and similarly , from the other @xmath17 branch , @xmath152 .",
    "going back to our original problem , we have to apply the method to our model systems both in the @xmath114 and @xmath112 ensembles .",
    "the only difficulty is that the method discussed above only allows us to include systems with one control parameter , @xmath141 . in our case",
    ", we are free to fix either @xmath11 or @xmath64 in the @xmath114 ensemble and @xmath110 or @xmath35 in the @xmath112 ensemble and regard the other as the control parameter .",
    "afterwards , we can change the previously fixed parameter and apply the method again for a wide range of parameter sets . in the @xmath114 ensemble",
    "a natural choice of parameter is @xmath11 with one fixed value of @xmath12 , as the entropy has to be a local maxima if the system is in a locally stable state .",
    "if we are at the extremum solution points @xmath153 for a different value of @xmath12 , we can clearly see which branch of the extremum solutions are unstable . to obtain a complete description we can use the same method if @xmath11 is fixed : @xmath154 in the @xmath112 ensemble ,",
    "first consider the case where we fix @xmath155 and we are looking for the maximum of the functional @xmath156 . on a branch of the extremum solutions",
    "@xmath157 using @xmath158 and @xmath159 , we easily find @xmath160 @xmath161 if we construct the stable branches for several values of @xmath35 , we can build up a general picture of the stability of the extremum solutions .",
    "we can apply the method for the case of a fixed @xmath110 as well .",
    "the extremum solutions are stable when @xmath156 is maximum : @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164    from the results derived above we have an easy to apply tool to separate the unstable solutions . in the microcanonical ( @xmath114 ) description",
    ", we have to inspect the extremum solutions in the @xmath165 plane for several fixed values of @xmath12 or in the @xmath166 plane for several fixed values of @xmath11 .",
    "however , in the @xmath112 ensemble , we have to inspect the extremum solutions in the @xmath167 plane for fixed @xmath168 values , or we have to consider the extremum solutions in the @xmath169 plane for the case of fixed @xmath110 . either way , as we will show below",
    ", we can generalize the approach to two parameters .",
    "in order to find the entropy extremum solutions for the systems above , we have to solve ( [ 3dpointfinal ] ) or ( [ nshellfinal ] ) , for the 3d point mass system , or the three types of shell system . generally , all of the differential equations can be written in the form of @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath88 ( as above , d is the dimension of the system ) . of course , the parameters @xmath172 and @xmath173 are different case by case .",
    "but it s quite interesting to mention that these systems behave similarly , regardless of whether we deal with a point mass system or a shell system , as long as the dimensions are the same .",
    "this is no longer a surprise if we look back at the hamiltonians .",
    "but the similarity does also mean that , for example , a three dimensional point mass system is equivalent to a three dimensional shell system as far as the one particle density function and the stability of solutions are concerned .",
    "also another advantage of the analogy is that we can dynamically model a three dimensional point mass system with a 3 dimensional shell system .",
    "both systems should show the same equilibrium properties in the mean - field limit .",
    "of course , we have to reassign the momentum of inertia of a shell to a different value in order to get _ exactly _ the same hamiltonian in both cases .",
    "equation ( [ genfinal ] ) should be solved with the following boundary conditions : @xmath174 unfortunately , there are two things which make finding the solutions more difficult .",
    "first of all , ( [ genfinal ] ) has a singularity at @xmath175 and , secondly , the existence and uniqueness of the solution are questionable for any given @xmath59 , @xmath110 , and @xmath176 we can not simply set @xmath59 and @xmath177 to satisfy our constraints of specified @xmath11 and @xmath12 because we do nt have explicit forms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath178 : the constraints are functionals of @xmath179 and @xmath180 . to eliminate this problem we can change our boundary condition problem to an initial value problem because , in the latter case , we can ensure the existence and uniqueness of our solution for any @xmath173 and @xmath172 . therefore we choose @xmath181 where @xmath182 , and we are able to construct the solution around @xmath175 in the form of a power series of @xmath183 and @xmath83 . from the numerical point of view",
    ", we should take the power series of @xmath183 and @xmath83 in @xmath184 ( a sufficiently small radius around @xmath175 ) , and then continue the integration of ( [ genfinal ] ) numerically from that point with the new initial values @xmath185 although the solution we get from ( [ initialvalue ] ) is unique , it does not satisfy both ( [ boundarycond ] ) and normalization .",
    "however , we can prove that we ca nt find any @xmath186 such that @xmath187 , where @xmath188 consists of those solutions @xmath189 which satisfy the same initial value problem of ( [ genfinal ] ) and ( [ initialvalue ] ) with @xmath190 and any @xmath172 .",
    "therefore all of the solutions are unique with fixed @xmath59 and @xmath178 or , in other words , all @xmath191 are unique .",
    "now let s consider @xmath192 , which can be defined the same way as we defined @xmath188 , but with @xmath193 .",
    "we can also prove that for any @xmath194 , there is only one @xmath195 .",
    "thus we can find all of the physically unique solutions by solving the initial value problem with a fixed @xmath196 in practice , we used the bulirsch - stoer method @xcite to integrate the coupled , nonlinear , differential equations from @xmath197 and bode s five point method @xcite to evaluate integrals .",
    "relative errors were controlled to within 10@xmath198 .",
    "the numerical solutions of ( [ genfinal ] ) are presented in figure 1 for the case of the spherically symmetric point mass system .",
    "the numerical results for the other models are qualitatively very similar , so we will use the point mass system to demonstrate their general features . as we can see , the solutions are bounded and , as a comparison , the results for the familiar isothermal sphere model ( @xmath199@xcite@xcite are presented as well .",
    "examination of figure [ fig01 ] clearly demonstrates the existence of an upper bound , @xmath200 which means that below a critical temperature there s no extremum solution at fixed @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , this can be proved rigorously from the differential equations.@xcite we can also see from the graph that @xmath201 and that , when @xmath202 @xmath203 , the number of solutions goes to infinity .    in figure [ fig02 ]",
    ", we show plots of three solutions for a given temperature ( we do nt know so far which of them , if any , are stable ) , and in figure [ fig03 ] we plot the volume density profiles of these solutions which have been normalized to the central density",
    ". as we can see , solutions represented by smaller @xmath204 are more and more concentrated at the center . as a comparison",
    ", we also give the density profiles of the well known isothermal sphere ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "there s some difference in the shape of the density profiles in the case where @xmath206 but , in general , the volume density profile is singular as @xmath207 and has the asymptotic solution @xmath208 .",
    "note that the linear density is @xmath209 in this asymptotic case .    in order to see the difference between density profiles of the isothermal sphere ( @xmath205 ) and the others , we plot the high temperature solutions ( figure [ fig04 ] ) .",
    "these are the @xmath210 asymptotic solutions where @xmath211 . if @xmath212 the relative volume density profiles curve down , but when @xmath213 the profiles curve up , indicating that if we have an @xmath7 reservoir , at higher radius the density profile should change from the homogeneous density profile .    in order to show how the @xmath12 constraint affects the shape of the density profiles , in figure .",
    "[ fig04 ] we plot the relative volume density profiles for a high temperature . as we can see in the figure , when @xmath214 the density profiles are no longer uniform and , depending on the sign of @xmath35 , the density is either increasing @xmath215 or decreasing @xmath216 while in the standard case @xmath217 in the limit of high temperature , the density is uniform",
    ". we can understand this behaviour if we recognize that in the limit @xmath218 gravity can be neglected .",
    "consider [ 3dpointdensity ] when @xmath219 .",
    "since the kinetic energy contribution is still maxwellian , the probalility of finding a particle with large @xmath220 is smaller when @xmath212 @xmath221 which means fewer particles will occupy larger radii . from the physical point of view , for a relatively large @xmath222 more particles should concentrate at larger radii in order to maintain the large value , while for relatively small @xmath222 fewer particles should settle at large radii in order to balance the centrifugal forces . for the case where @xmath213 the situation is the opposite , and the density profile should increase with increasing radius",
    "of course , while we can not use this argument for finite temperatures , the origin of the difference in the density profiles when @xmath206 is due to this effect . at finite temperature",
    "the tendency persists but the behavior is not guaranteed .    in figures [ fig05 ] and [ fig06 ] ,",
    "the stability properties are presented according to the previously discussed poincare s linear series of equilibria with fixed @xmath12 and @xmath11 in the @xmath114 ensemble . as we can see , the gravothermal catastrophe holds for the @xmath114 ensemble as well . in figure",
    "[ fig05 ] , below a critical energy there s no extremum solution ( here the radius is fixed , not the energy as in@xcite ) .",
    "also , at the same point , @xmath223 jumps to @xmath224 ( we follow the spiral in the counter - clockwise direction . )",
    "thus only the branch labelled @xmath142 is stable , and the other branches are increasingly unstable because additional eigenvalues become negative . in the opposite case ,",
    "when we fix @xmath11 ( figure [ fig06 ] ) , we can see that above a critical value of @xmath12 there s no extremum solution .",
    "the corresponding functions , @xmath225 and @xmath226 are plotted in figure [ fig07 ] .",
    "we see that the entropy is monotonic up to a critical energy in the stable region of the extremum solutions .    in the @xmath112 ensemble ,",
    "the results are presented in figures [ fig08 ] and [ fig09 ] .",
    "first of all , in the case of fixed @xmath35 , we have to take a close look at the solutions in the @xmath227 graph .",
    "only the first branch of the solutions are locally stable up to a critical value of @xmath110 , say @xmath228 because @xmath229 , and there s no extremum for @xmath230 . as a comparison , we selected a value of @xmath231 in figure [ fig02 ] corresponding to figure [ fig08 ] ; as we wind along the curve to a particular @xmath232 value , the extremum solutions are represented by a more concentrated set of density profiles .",
    "another result of the stability investigations is that in figure [ fig01 ] , only those solutions are locally stable which are to the right of the largest maximum of the @xmath233 curves .",
    "the corresponding -@xmath129 can be seen in figure [ fig10 ] . in the stable region",
    ", it s a monotonic function , and therefore there s no sign of a phase transition .",
    "the same holds in the @xmath114 ensemble as can be seen by inspecting the entropy curves in figure [ fig07 ] .",
    "the results for fixed @xmath234 are shown in figure [ fig09 ] .",
    "the stable region of extremum solutions becomes unstable at @xmath235 and at @xmath236 there are no extrema .",
    "the free energy behaves similarly to the case of fixed @xmath35 : it s monotonic , and there s no phase transition .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study the equilibrium thermodynamics of spherically symmetric self - gravitating systems in the mean field limit .",
    "we investigated both the spherically symmetric point mass system and shell systems of differing dimension confined in a sphere .",
    "these systems are related to each other both in the form of their hamiltonian and their equilibrium states .",
    "furthermore , the _ three _ dimensional shell system has the interesting and potentially useful property that , with regard to the equilibrium density profile , it is equivalent to the spherically symmetric point mass system .",
    "our description is more general than the standard treatment of the isothermal sphere @xcite  since , in addition to the energy , we take into account @xmath12 , the sum of the squares of the individual angular momentum , which is conserved in the mean - field limit for spherically symmetric systems . in this new type of microcanonical description ( @xmath114 ensemble )",
    "we evaluated the  equilibrium  one - particle probability density function for each type of system by finding the extrema of the entropy .",
    "the resulting pdf s turned out to be similar to eddington s anisotropic density function.@xcite therefore the density profiles obtained here also differ from the isothermal sphere which , in our formulation , is the special case @xmath237 near the system center , the density profiles are similar to those of the isothermal sphere .",
    "however , as the outer boundary is approached , depending on the value of @xmath178 , deviations can become large , increasing or decreasing depending on the sign of @xmath178 .",
    "the physics behind this behavior is simple : if the system is spun up corresponding to negative @xmath178 , the outer density increases .",
    "if , on the other hand , the radial kinetic energy dominates the rotational energy , @xmath238 and the outer density decreases .",
    "in addition to the microcanonical ensemble , the lagrange multiplier @xmath239 which arose from the constraint on @xmath222 yielded a new type of canonical ensemble ( @xmath13 which corresponds to the system being embedded in a heat bath at temperature @xmath240 and an @xmath7 reservoir at @xmath241 . but this analogy is only correct if the system is , at the least , in a local equilibrium state , and this issue demonstrates the importance of checking the stability properties of the extremum solutions . the method known as poincare s linear series of equilibria proved adequate to analyze the stability of the extremum solutions in both ensembles with a little extra effort . using it",
    ", we showed that only certain types of solutions are locally stable , and others are saddle points .",
    "in other words , the gravothermal catastrophe is also present both in the @xmath114 and @xmath242 ensembles , which means that there is no phase transition in our spherical mean - field models , although one was expected to be present because of the @xmath64 constraint .    from their description of the gravothermal catastrophe it is easy to imagine that lynden - bell and wood had in mind a dynamical process in which mass was transferred from the halo to a concentrated central core .",
    "however , their approach was confined to a comparison of stationary states . hints of collapse have been seen in some n particle simulations.@xcite in future work we plan to study the complete dynamics of the collapse , both analytically and using dynamical simulation of n particle and n shell systems .",
    "the shell systems should prove especially useful since they avoid the complication arising from the formation of tight binaries@xcite .",
    "the authors benefitted from conversations with igor prokhorenkov and michael kiessling .",
    "they also are grateful for the support of the research foundation and department of information services of texas christian university ."
