    "recent research carried out on competing interacting networks @xcite does not take into account the fact that real - world networks often compete not only to survive but also to take over or even destroy their competitors @xcite .",
    "for example , in international politics and economics , when one country imposes economic sanctions on another , feedback mechanisms can cause the country imposing the sanctions to also be adversely affected .",
    "the decision by a wealthier country to keep military spending at a high level long enough to exhaust its poorer competitor can also contribute to its own exhaustion @xcite .",
    "similarly , in warfare , any attack depletes the resources of the attacking force and can elicit a counter - attack from the competing force @xcite .",
    "also , in nature , an incursion between species can alter the dynamics of predator - prey interaction @xcite .",
    "although , these competing interactions are a widespread real - world phenomenon , current studies analyze only effects of attack on attacked networks , but disregarding its effect on the external attacking network . for example , for both single and interactive networks , existing studies on network robustness report that every network , regardless of the size and architecture , eventually can be destroyed @xcite .",
    "but , what then prevents a network from attacking a weaker competitor or , what is the optimal moment for initiating or ending an attack ? in order to identify the factors that inhibit a network from attacking and demolishing a weaker competitor and to determine the optimal moment and duration of an attack , we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies the cost of an attack by connecting the feedback mechanisms and resilience dynamics between two competing dynamic networks with differing levels of resilience @xcite",
    "we introduce a general methodology that can be applied to networks of any size and structure .",
    "first , as an illustrative example , we describe two competing barabsi - albert ( ba ) networks @xcite which we designate network s and network w. this model differs from the single network ba model in that the two interconnected networks have both intra - network and inter - network links @xcite",
    ". one real - world example of this kind of network interaction is firms in an economic network that link with other firms both domestically and abroad .    using the preferential attachment ( pa ) rule @xcite",
    ", we generate networks s and w starting with @xmath0 nodes in each network . at each time step",
    "we add a new node that connects with @xmath1 existing nodes in network s and with @xmath2 existing nodes in network w , where the probability of each connection depends on the total node degrees in networks s and w. similarly , using the pa rule we connect a new node in network w with @xmath3 nodes inside network w and with @xmath4 nodes in network s.    in a broad class of real - world networks , nodes can fail either due to inherent reason  @xcite or because their functionality depends on their neighborhood  @xcite .",
    "hence , any node in either of the two networks , e.g. , a node @xmath5 inside network s with @xmath6 neighbors in its own network and @xmath7 neighbors in network w , can fail at any moment , either internally  independent of other nodes  with a probability @xmath8 or externally with a probability @xmath9 .",
    "node @xmath5 externally fails with a probability @xmath9 when , similar to the watts model  @xcite , the total fraction of its active neighbors is less than or equal to a fractional threshold @xmath10 which is equal for all nodes in both networks .",
    "the larger the @xmath10 value , the less resilient the network .",
    "we assume that one of the two networks is more resilient than the other , distinguishing between strong network s and weak network w. we do so by assigning different fractional thresholds to the strong and weak networks , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , with @xmath13 .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that an internally - failed node in network s or network w recovers from its last internal failure after a period @xmath14",
    ". consecutive failures of the same node stretch the effective failure times and introduce heterogeneity into the distribution of inactivity periods .",
    "since in real - world networks it is dangerous for nodes to be inactive , we allow the strong network to take over nodes in the weak network when a node @xmath5 spends more time in internal failure than @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "figure  [ 10 ] qualitatively shows the interaction process .",
    "we quantify the current collective state of the strong and weak networks in terms of the fraction of active nodes , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we assume that initially on both networks have internal and external failure probability values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ 1](a ) shows a two - parameter phase diagram for each network in which the hysteresis is composed of two spinodals separating two collective states , i.e. , the primarily `` active '' and the primarily `` inactive . ''",
    "figure  [ 1](b ) shows that increasing the value of @xmath21 leads to catastrophic first - order phase transitions in both networks .",
    "when each network recovers ( i.e. , when @xmath21 is decreased to previous values ) , the fraction of active nodes returns to an upper state . nevertheless , the critical point in the recovery is well beyond the point at which the network collapses .",
    "figure  [ 1](b ) also shows ( solid line ) that the initial choice of parameters makes network s more resilient to network fluctuations in the value of @xmath21 and that the fluctuation needed to initiate the collapse of network s ( @xmath22 ) is much larger than the fluctuation needed to initiate the collapse of network w ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "[ 2](a ) indicate that when network s increases the internal failure probability @xmath68 and so @xmath58 in an effort to damage network w it also causes partial damage to itself .",

    "if @xmath71 , however , network s undergoes a first order transition that leads to collapse , a situation that network s clearly must avoid .    inspecting the recovery of the previous internal failure probability values after the attack we find that the fraction of active nodes in both networks exhibit a hysteresis behavior .",
    "note that when the transition at @xmath72 is surpassed neither network is able to restore its functioning to the levels previous to the attack .",
    "the analytical results indicate that attacking network s is effective only for certain values of @xmath58 .",

    "two solid lines with a slope of one indicate the region in which an attack by network s is effective . when the slope of function @xmath74 is greater than one ( the region between the two shaded lines ) , increasing @xmath58 produces more damage in network w than in network s and is thus an effective attack strategy .    in order to measure the effect of capturing nodes from a competitor network and how takeovers can modify the resilience properties of a network , we design a model in which network s is again more resilient than network w ( @xmath13 ) and where node @xmath5 of network w is taken over by network s if its internal failure time exceeds @xmath15 , where @xmath14 is a certain failure time and @xmath16 a constant .",
    "note that the longer a node in network w remains inactive ( i.e. , the higher the value of @xmath16 ) , the higher the probably that it will be acquired by network s. real - world examples of this mechanism include sick or disabled prey in an ecological system @xcite or countries whose economic systems remain in recession for too long a period .      to evaluate the acquisition costs in both networks we define network wealth ( capital ) as proportional to two variables : the total number of links in the network  as defined in conservation biology @xcite  and the resilience of the network .",
    "note that if two networks have the same number of links but different resiliencies their wealth is not equal .",
    "note also that when network s acquires a node of degree @xmath75 from network w the overall resilience of network s decreases because it has acquired a weaker node .",
    "thus network s pays a instantaneous , collective cost through a feedback mechanism that decreases its resilience from an initial threshold @xmath11 to a new threshold @xmath62 .",
    "one of the important issues in dynamic systems that have a critical point as an attractor is whether a conservation of energy is required in local dynamic interactions @xcite . to quantify how threshold @xmath76 changes in competing networks , we define a conservation law that relates the feedback mechanism to the resilience dynamics as @xmath77 here",
    "@xmath78 is the size of the strong network , @xmath79 its average degree , and @xmath75 the degree of the node that has been taken over .",
    "thus , we assume that the more important the acquired node ( i.e. , the larger its degree @xmath75 ) , the greater the cost to the resilience of network s , making it more vulnerable to future attacks . as a result ,",
    "when a predator ( strong ) network s increases its size @xmath78 and its degree @xmath80 , its acquisition cost , @xmath81 , will decrease .    here",
    "we quantify how threshold @xmath62 of the stronger network changes in competing networks where we assume that threshold @xmath12 of the weaker network does not change because every node has the same threshold .",

    "( 4 ) we obtain @xmath90    figure  [ 33](a ) shows that when network s acquires nodes in network w the threshold @xmath62 of network s is increasingly affected as time passes . in this example , a node in network w is taken over by network s when the node is in failure state longer than @xmath15 time steps , where @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "note that as network s acquires weak nodes , its threshold @xmath62 increases and it becomes more vulnerable .",

    "in conclusion , we have presented a theoretical framework based on resilience , competition , and phase transitions to introduce a cost - of - attack concept that relates feedback mechanisms to resilience dynamics defined using a linear conservation law . our model for competing networks",
    "can be applied across a wide range of human activities , from medicine and finance to international relations , intelligence services , and military operations .",
    "we focus on a specific context where one more resilient network attacks the less resilient competitor network .",
    "the model assumptions about the structure and dynamics for two interactive networks with competing interactions and different resilience levels have to be adjusted in regard to different real world scenarios ( see the electronic supplementary material , s4 ) . the ability to measure attacker network resilience and",
    "its attack cost is crucial because every weakening of the resilience reduces the probability of the network survival under future attacks .",
    "for example , in political socio - economic systems a network - based approach for overcoming competing countries could be more effective by applying economical sanctions than carrying out military actions .",
    "interdependent links established between countries during prosperous times can facilitate sanctions ( intentional fluctuations ) that are used as a weapon when more resilient countries try to overcome less resilient countries .",
    "they can also facilitate the global propagation of economic recessions ( spontaneous fluctuations ) . during long economic crises",
    "these interdependent links can become fatal for less resilient countries , whose weakness is enhanced by being underdogs in a global network - of - networks and , at the same time , whose resources can be captured by more powerful countries .",
    "although , our proposed framework is suited for representing the most simplest case of bilateral economic interdependence between just two countries ( networks ) , it provides the basis for more general scenarios of alliances of more countries ( networks ) .",
    "the concept of alliance where some countries unite in order to attack some other alliance is especially interesting when there is heterogeneity in resilience of allied attacker countries .",
    "for example , economically most dominant countries can increase their dominance at the expense of their partners in the alliance or they can , on the other hand , depend on the alliance s weakest country ( see the supplementary material , s4 a ) .",
    "in addition to the intentional fluctuations characteristic of human societies , our methodology can also be applied to a broad class of complex systems in which spontaneous fluctuations occur , from brain functioning to ecological habitats and climate fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the methodology is based on specific structure , dynamics and mechanisms of the model of networks with competing interactions and different resilience levels , that have to be adjusted for different systems and contexts of application ( see the supplementary material , s4 ) .    *",

    "most real world systems are composed of networks which interact with each other in different ways . in our model",
    "we focus on a specific context where one more resilient ( strong ) network ( attack initiator ) attacks the less resilient ( weaker ) competitor network ( attack target ) .",
    "the proposed model depends on the structure of two interactive competing networks and the defined dynamics between initiating an attack against a competitor network and the consequences that might weaken the attack initiator resilience . within this framework assumptions about the structure and dynamics for two interactive networks with competing interactions and different resilience levels have to be adjusted in regard to different real world scenarios .    for the structure of interactive networks we use multilayer network model distinguishing between intra - network and inter - network connections .",
    "although in our analysis we focused on specific architectures of intra - network and inter - network connections , in general they can be arbitrarily chosen depending on real world examples .",
    "each competing network is formed by the intra - network connections between its own nodes , while interactions between competing networks are determined by inter - network connections between nodes from two opposing competitor networks .",
    "we also assumed static intra - network and inter - network connections , while in different real world examples these connections can also change through time and depend on different spatial and temporal attributes .",
    "when we represent both an attacker or attacked system as a network , we must also decide which attributes and level of details of the system are of interest for a specific real - world scenario .",
    "a single node in network represents a particular component of a system or aggregated set of similar components , while the consequences of an attack are described by an active or an inactive node s state .",
    "the global collective state of both the attacker and the attacked network is measured by the total fraction of active nodes in each network .",
    "finally , the interpretation of node s activity and inactivity depends on the application context of different real world attack scenarios .    in order to explain the general network vulnerability to global cascades of local and external node failures / inactivations caused by attack consequences , we model node dynamics by a cascade contagion model with stochastic internal and external activation / inactivation process @xcite , inspired by the watts threshold model @xcite where each node has a probability to internally fail / inactivate independently of other nodes . at the same time , the probability to externally fail / inactivate if a fraction of its active intra - network and inter - network neighbors is less than or equal to a specified fractional threshold .",
    "this fractional threshold can be interpreted as the network resilience to failures due to interdependencies , the larger the value of the fractional threshold , the less resilient the network .",
    "we assume that the attacker network has a higher resilience than an opponent network and that it is willing to partially weaken its own resilience in order to more severely damage a less resilient competitor .",
    "attack concept and also its influence on resilience dynamics of the attacker is based on causing critical fraction of active neighbors for nodes from an opponent network , and using takeover and substitution mechanisms for them after their long inactivity",
    ". however , this concept is highly context - dependent and its mechanisms have to be properly mapped in regard to different real work scenarios .    as the attacker network has higher resilience than an opponent network it can induce the implicit indirect attack by increasing the probability of internal failures / inactivations of its nodes causing critical fraction of active neighbors for nodes from an opponent network .",
    "in addition , takeover and substitution mechanisms define direct attack on an opponent network .",
    "takeover mechanism is related to the explicit attack on an opponent network with the same type of nodes as the attacker network and the explicit reduction of the attacker network resilience by increasing its fractional threshold . on the other hand",
    ", the substitution mechanism represents the explicit attack on an opponent network with implicit reduction of the attacker network resilience by having nodes whose state is more dependent on nodes form the opponent networks .",
    "although we focus on the most simplified scenario of two interactive competing networks where just one and more resilient network can attack a less resilient opponent network , the introduced framework provides the basis for more general scenarios of alliances of more different networks with also different interaction types between them ( e.g. competing intra - specific / network , antagonistic , mutualistic ) and strategies for attack as well as defense .",
    "how many new parameters have to be introduced for this scenario also depends highly on the context of the study of interest .",
    "we can observe each network collective state and resilience dynamics separately or depending on their affiliation while a specific attack or defense strategy is taking place .",
    "how successful our network model might be when applied in practice depends first on how capable we are in estimating model parameters and mapping them to real - world context . as described before our model is structured with the architecture of intra - network and inter - network connections which define networks structure and constraints for an interaction , and with parameters for cascade dynamics including internal and external failure probabilities , the fractional threshold and the limit for inactivity period .",

    "although , we are focusing here on the most simplest case of bilateral economic interdependence between just two countries , such actions can also bring to economic consequences to other third parties like neighbours countries of the target or its trading partners , but as well as senders .",
    "economic sanctions are deliberate , government - inspired withdrawal , or threat of withdrawal , of customary trade or financial relations and are most effective when aimed against friends and close trading partners as these countries have more to lose than countries with which the sender has limited or adversarial relations .",
    "interdependent links established between countries during prosperous times can facilitate sanctions ( intentional fluctuations ) that are used as a weapon when more resilient countries try to overcome less resilient countries .",
    "they can also facilitate the global propagation of economic recessions ( spontaneous fluctuations ) . during long economic crises these interdependent links can become fatal for less resilient countries . similarly , when economic sanctions are lifted for the weaker economies is much harder to restore than for the stronger economics which recover after suffering little damage .    in order to explain the economic cost for the country imposing the sanctions , we first specify state of the country s economic system by collective activity of individual firms which are part of the country economy .",
    "firms are connected to each other directly or indirectly through their business transactions ( i.e. obtaining materials from suppliers , delivering goods / products to services or r&d cooperation ) .",
    "economic network of each country is represented by inter - firm network assuming that intra - network connections specify cooperative interactions between firms of same country , and inter - network connections specify interactions between firms in different countries that are subjected to the bilateral economic relation between two countries .",
    "as many firms borrow from and lend to each other , and in particular when these firms are speculative and dependent on the credit flow , shocks to the liquidity of some firms may cause the other firms to also experience financial difficulties @xcite . the way how geographically localized shock propagate through such inter - firms networks",
    "determines country resilience to the shock experienced by their corresponding firms .",
    "these dynamic vulnerabilities of firms can be related to the fractional threshold parameter that can be controlled by its asset - debt ratio where activity / inactivity of a firm is determined by its solvency ( see s1 .",
    "resilience dynamics in finance ) .",
    "the attack concepts is related to inducing the implicit indirect attack by increasing probability of internal failures / inactivations of its firms causing target country firms to become insolvent .",
    "in addition , takeover mechanisms define attack on the target country economy by taking over their firms which are insolvent for some critical time .",
    "the extension of our modeling framework from bilateral economic interdependence between just two inter - firm networks of competing countries to more general scenarios of network alliances where some countries unite in order to attack some other alliance is especially interesting when we introduce the resilience heterogeneity of allied attacker countries .",
    "the resilience heterogeneity of allied attackers can induce opposing interests and attack strategies between partners as well as provide descriptions of scenarios where economically most dominant countries increase their dominance relative to other countries and at the expense of their partner countries in the alliance or where , on the other hand , economically strong countries depend on alliance s weakest country .",
    "for example , suppose two countries , i and ii imposing economic sanctions at the third country , iii , where i is more resilient than ii and both i and ii are more resilient than iii .",
    "a country resilience can be different since ii is more linked with iii than i. when the sanctions are lifted , the relative resilience between i and ii can be increased making i even more dominant than before the sanctions .",
    "but on the other hand due to the interdependencies between allied countries , i.e. countries i and ii , attack strategy of i is dependent also on the state of ii .",
    "[ [ ecological - system - competing - animal - social - networks - under - predator - prey - interactions ] ] ecological system : competing animal social networks under predator - prey interactions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    here we demonstrate how our modeling framework is mapped to two competing animal social networks under predator - prey interactions .",
    "we explain possible choices and an interpretation for intra / inter - network structures and activation / inactivation dynamics for a specific scenario where individuals from one predator species attack individuals from one prey species .",
    "a predator is an animal that hunts and kills other animals ( its preys ) for food .",
    "an interpretation of predators and preys internal or external activity depends on the given context of the study of interest and the interpretation of their intra / inter - network connections .",
    "the intra - network structure for attacking ( predator ) and attacked ( prey ) networks can be represented by corresponding socio - spatial network of their individuals @xcite . while , inter - network connections , i.e. connections between predator and prey individuals , determine which predator individuals can come in close contact with which prey individuals to hunt them based on spatial and temporal factors . interactions between animal individuals are highly dependent on their spatial proximity . thus determining the structure of social animal network",
    "also depends on given spatial context @xcite .",
    "recent technological innovations in tracking devices and reality mining approaches are starting to enable remote monitoring and collection of detailed information of behaviors of individual animals at high spatial and temporal resolution @xcite .",
    "a structure of social network between animal individuals influence diversity of social behaviors such as finding and choosing a sexual partner , making movement decisions , engaging in foregoing or anti - predator behavior which is manifested at the population level in the form of habitat use , mating systems , information or disease transmission .",
    "social interactions between individuals of same species can differ in their type ( competitive , cooperative , sexual ) , frequency and duration .",
    "animals modify their social interactions in response to changes in external conditions such as climate , predation pressure , and social environment @xcite .",
    "although , interactions among animals are dynamic , many animal social network studies examine static structures .    for a simplified predator - prey interaction scenario",
    "we can assume static cooperative interactions and that there are no competing interactions between individuals of the same species , i.e. infraspecific competition is not taken into account .",
    "cooperating interactions between individuals play an important role in the spreading of information within the network affecting an access to resources and the probability of predation of an individual .",
    "for example , individuals that have large number of intra - network connections can be better in discovering new food patches .    with that interpretation of the intra - network and inter - network connections",
    ", we can model predators coordinated attack by their activation dynamics . in this context it is reasonable to assume that a node in attacked ( prey ) network will externally fail ( be killed by predators ) if there is enough activated predators ( i.e. fraction of active inter - neighbors larger then given threshold ) that are in close range of the prey ( i.e. those connected with inter - network connections ) . as usual , prey can also externally fail ( die or migrate ) if its fraction of active intra - neighbors is equal or smaller then the fractional threshold . in this context",
    "we can interpret internal and external failure / activation probabilities , and the limit for inactivity period for predators as their opportunity , exigency and willingness to hunt prey together in certain time . while those parameters in prey s case can be interpret as a way how prey sustains predators attacks or keeps a certain habitat patch active with its own species through reproduction .",
    "prey organisms that are difficult to find , catch , kill or consume will survive and reproduce .",
    "the explained attack concept is in contrast to the indirect attack concept where inactive / failed states of attacker nodes cause external failure of attacked network nodes .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in a scenario where inter - network connections represent prey dependencies on its predators , i.e. where for each prey there is a needed fraction of active predators for them to survive because the active predators balance the population size of a prey ( see also section s3 .",
    "coupled ba interdependent networks with equal connectivity but different threshold ) . in that scenario ,",
    "predators and prey depend on each other in that the predators rely on prey as food source , but in turn they also keep prey population against over - population which could cause decrease of their food source . beside that , in some cases prey species can even facilitate its own predator @xcite . a possible context that relies on predator and",
    "prey interdependence is explanation of how a disease or other internal disturbances in predator population can effect prey population dynamics and vice versa .",
    "in contrast to socio - economic scenario of competing network of countries firms , takeover mechanism is not suitable attack concept for scenario of predator - prey interactions where we model interaction between social network of different node types , but substitution mechanism is suitable to represent additional level of predation influence on prey population . in general predation influences organisms at two ecological levels . at the level of the individual",
    ", the prey organism has an abrupt decline of its lifetime reproductive success , because it will never reproduce again , and at the level of the community , predation reduces the number of individuals in the prey population . accordingly , the direct cost for strong predator which easily hunts and kills its prey is generally negligible , but indirect cost can be manifested through the fact that each reduction in prey abundance impedes finding a next prey . on the other hand ,",
    "the direct cost is noticeable for intraguild predators , predators that kill and eat other predators of different species at the same trophic level @xcite .",
    "classical models of predator - prey population dynamics , often considered as the basic building blocks of larger , food - web models , explain how tropic interactions lead to oscillatory population cycles .",
    "these models assume well - mixed population where all pairs of individuals have equal probabilities of interacting with each other which corresponds to a complete graph structure .",
    "this means that the encounter rate between predators and prey is expressed in a mass - action fashion , i.e. as a product of prey and predator landscape densities @xcite .",
    "our model can describe mechanistic approach of predator - prey interactions within structured population of individuals of two animal species .",
    "animal social networks are harder to determine and observe than human social networks as animal network data must be collected by direct observation of interactions between individual animals @xcite .",
    "for some large herding species it may be possible to count every individual , but for many species this is not possible . in cases",
    "when is too time consuming to collect animal network data at individual level due to difficulties of capturing and identifying individuals , it can be useful to observe categories of individuals and consider interactions between them . since spatial proximity is significant factor for establishing and maintaining cooperation between individuals , we can observe interactions between predators and prey through patches they occupy @xcite .",
    "while in social animal networks , one node represents just a single individual of a given species and each edge represents some form of interaction between two individuals , in food webs and ecological network studies a node typically represents a species while connections between nodes represent different types of interactions between species .",
    "species may interact with each other through antagonism ( prey - predator , host - parasitoid , or host - parasite interaction ) , competition , or mutualism @xcite .",
    "food webs can provide initial blueprints of inter - connections between animal socio - spatial networks when extending our modeling framework from interaction between just two species networks to more general scenario of network alliances where several predator and/or prey networks can cooperate or compete between each other .",
    "for example , in the case when two prey species have a common predator , one prey species can lead to indirect exclusion of the other species or the case where two predators alone compete for a single prey species , one species is always excluded by the other , even in the presence of a top predator ."
