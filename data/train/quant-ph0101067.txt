    "as a consequence of heisenberg inequalities , the electromagnetic field exhibits quantum fluctuations even in the vacuum state .",

    "as a consequence , the vacuum fluctuations manifest themselves through macroscopic forces .",
    "these casimir forces are usually computed by comparing the mode density in the absence and in the presence of perfectly reflecting boundaries @xcite . in a local formulation , they can also be understood as resulting from the radiation pressure exerted by the vacuum fluctuations reflected by the boundaries @xcite . in the simplest case of a scalar field in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) spacetime ,",

    "a problem in any calculation of vacuum induced effects is to dispose of the divergences associated with the infiniteness of the total vacuum energy .",
    "usually , this is done by arbitrarily cutting off the mode density .",
    "the divergences of the energy in the absence and in the presence of the boundaries cancel each other , which leads to a finite net result at the limit of infinite cutoff frequency . in the local formulation ,",
    "the field correlation function diverges when the fields are evaluated at the same point .",
    "a regularized stress tensor is obtained by splitting the two points and ignoring the divergent part @xcite .",

    "we use the local formulation and introduce frequency dependent reflectivity and transmittivity coefficients for the two mirrors , which are assumed to obey conditions of reality , unitarity , causality and high frequency transparency .",
