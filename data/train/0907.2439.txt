    "precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies such as those obtained by the wmap satellite @xcite provide valuable information on the very early universe . any theoretical model that attempts to explain the evolution of the universe before the big bang nucleosynthesis will also have to explain the observed cmb anisotropies .",
    "even though these anisotropies are almost gaussian , a small amount of non - gaussianity is still allowed by the data @xcite and future experiments such as planck @xcite might detect this small amount of the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "even though the simplest slow - roll single field inflation models predict that the non - gaussianity of the fluctuations should be very difficult to be detected @xcite , recently , theoretical models which can produce sizeable non - gaussianity has been extensively studied by many authors @xcite .    among them",
    ", the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation model can produce large non - gaussianity by the fact that the sound speed of the perturbations can be much smaller than one due to the non - trivial form of the kinetic term @xcite .",
    "dbi inflation models are also well motivated by string theory @xcite . in this model , the inflaton fields",
    "are identified with the positions of a moving d3 brane in the six - dimensional internal space .",
    "the dynamics of the d3 brane is described by the dbi action . however , recently it has been pointed out that single field dbi inflation driven by a mobile d3 brane with large non - gaussianity might contradict with the current wmap data . for current and stringent observational constraints and consequences of dbi - inflation",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid these constraints is to consider multi - field dbi models @xcite . since the position of the brane in each compact direction",
    "is described by a scalar field , dbi inflation is naturally a multi - field inflationary model @xcite .",
    "as first pointed out by @xcite , in multi - field inflation models , the curvature perturbation is modified on large scales due to the entropy perturbation .",
    "even though there are some works considering multi - field inflationary models with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite , the consistent analysis for the entropy modes in the multi - field dbi inflation model has started only very recently @xcite .    in @xcite , the three - point functions in the small sound speed limit and at leading order in the slow - roll expansion were obtained and it was shown that in addition to the purely adiabatic three - point function , there exists a mixed component @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the adiabatic and the entropy perturbations , respectively . since the momentum dependence of the three - point function from the adiabatic modes was shown to be identical with the mixed component , the shape of the bispectrum of the curvature perturbations remains the same as in the single - field case , while the amplitude is affected by the entropy perturbation .",
    "even though previous works on the non - gaussianity in the multi - field dbi inflation model are mainly limited to the bispectrum , it is expected that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) trispectrum also provides strong constraints on early universe models . at the moment , the constraints are rather weak given by @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 denotes the size of the trispectrum .",
    "however , planck will tighten the constraints significantly reaching @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "although these estimations are obtained assuming local type non - gaussianity , we expect similar constraints can be obtained for non - gaussianity from dbi inflation .",
    "it is also worth noting that the analysis in the single field dbi inflation model shows that the trispectrum from the contact interaction diagram is enhanced in the small sound speed limit as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "even though the contribution from the scalar exchange interaction was overlooked in this analysis , recently , it has been confirmed that the same scaling holds for the trispectrum from this interaction @xcite . as in the bispectrum case @xcite ,",
    "the observational constraints depend on the shape of the wave vectors configuration .",
    "therefore , it is important to calculate the full shape dependence of the trispectrum in the multi - field dbi inflation model .",
    "for the details of the observations of the cmb trispectrum , see @xcite .    for this purpose",
    ", recently we have calculated the quantum trispectrum from the contact interaction and obtained the simple understanding of the origin of the interaction terms of the multi - field dbi inflation @xcite . in this paper , as a natural continuation , we will calculate the scalar exchange trispectrum and obtain the complete theoretical prediction for the quantum trispectrum of multi - field dbi inflation . for a related work , where only the purely entropic component of the quantum scalar exchange trispectrum was calculated ,",

    "<S> we compute the leading order connected four - point function of the primordial curvature perturbation coming from the four - point function of the fields in multi - field dbi inflation models . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the consistency relations in the squeezed limit and in the counter - collinear limit hold as in single field models thanks to special properties of the dbi action . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the momentum dependence of the trispectra coming from the adiabatic , mixed and purely entropic contributions separately and we find that they have different momentum dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this means that if the amount of the transfer from the entropy perturbations to the curvature perturbation is significantly large , the trispectrum can distinguish multi - field dbi inflation models from single field dbi inflation models . </S>",
    "<S> a large amount of transfer @xmath0 suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath1 and the amplitude of the bispectrum @xmath2 and so it can ease the severe observational constraints on the dbi inflation model based on string theory . on the other hand , it enhances the amplitude of the trispectrum @xmath3 for a given amplitude of the bispectrum . </S>"
