    "in the 1980s , alain connes presented the concept of non - commutative geometry as an extension of the usual notion of a topological space ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea goes back to the 1940s , when israel gelfand and mark naimark showed that every commutative @xmath2-algebra is isomorphic to the @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 of continuous functions on a locally compact hausdorff space @xmath4 vanishing at infinity ( see @xcite ) . from this starting point",
    ", one sees that a lot of properties of the space @xmath4 can be translated into properties of its @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 .",
    "motivated by this , in non - commutative geometry one considers a general @xmath2-algebra as a non - commutative space .    to describe geometry on a non - commutative space , connes introduced so - called _ spectral triples_. the definition of a spectral triple is suggested by the fact that many geometric properties of a compact connected riemannian spin manifold @xmath0 without boundary can be obtained from the dirac operator @xmath5 acting on a clifford bundle @xmath6 over @xmath0 .",
    "for example , one can reproduce the dimension of @xmath0 by the asymptotic growth of the eigenvalues of @xmath5 via @xmath7 and one can detect the geodesic distance on @xmath0 by the formula @xmath8\\right\\|_{l^2(\\sigma m ) } \\leq 1 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] these properties can be transported to the picture of @xmath2-algebras : a spectral triple is a triple @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a @xmath2-algebra , @xmath11 is a hilbert space carrying a faithful action of @xmath10 on @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath11 such that @xmath14 $ ] is bounded for @xmath15 belonging to a dense sub - algebra of @xmath10 and such that the resolvent @xmath16 of @xmath13 is compact . for a general spectral triple ,",
    "one can define notions of dimension and metric in analogy to the formulas above .",
    "hence on a closed riemannian spin manifold with dirac operator @xmath5 , a spectral triple which detects the dimension and the geodesic metric on @xmath0 is given by the triple @xmath17 .    during the last decades",
    "there have been several approaches to construct spectral triples for more examples than the one of a closed riemannian spin manifold .",
    "in particular there are some constructions for certain fractals which have a non - integer hausdorff dimension , done for example by erik christensen , christina ivan and their collaborators ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) : for some fractals , it is possible to detect the hausdorff dimension as well as the geodesic distance of the space from a spectral triple .",
    "a more general approach has been suggested by ian palmer ( @xcite ) and by john pearson and jean bellissard @xcite ) .",
    "palmer shows that under mild conditions the hausdorff dimension of every compact metric space can be discovered by a spectral triple . for these triples",
    "one can also find an estimate from above for the metric .",
    "but the constructions palmer is considering lead away from the geometry of the space , since these constructions make use of an approximation of the space by a discrete subset .    from the aspect of dimension",
    ", it is also interesting to note that there has been a construction by erik christensen and christina ivan showing that to any given positive real number @xmath18 , one can construct a spectral triple of dimension @xmath18 , where @xmath10 is a limit of finite - dimensional @xmath2-algebras and @xmath13 is a limit of finite - dimensional operators ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence at least theoretically it is possible to define spectral triples of arbitrary dimension on certain spaces .",
    "the question we are dealing with in this thesis is whether it is possible to define two different spectral triples on one space , which both give reasonable geometries ( in terms of dimension and metric ) .",
    "therefore we consider so - called _ sub - riemannian manifolds _ ( or in a more specialized setting _ carnot manifolds _ ) , which are riemannian manifolds @xmath0 equipped with a bracket - generating horizontal sub - bundle @xmath19 of their tangent bundle @xmath20 .",
    "it has been detected by wei - liang chow ( @xcite ) in 1939 that in this case and if @xmath0 is connected , any two points on @xmath0 can be connected by a curve which is tangent to the horizontal distribution @xmath19 .",
    "this means that we obtain a metric on @xmath0 via the formula @xmath21 which differs from the metric induced by the geodesic distance on @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the hausdorff dimension of the metric space @xmath22 turns out to be strictly greater than the hausdorff dimension of the metric space @xmath23 .",
    "this result is due to john mitchell ( @xcite ) and is also known as _",
    "mitchell s measure theorem_.    the most important example for such a sub - riemannian manifold is the @xmath24-dimensional heisenberg group @xmath25 . it can be represented as the matrix group consisting of matrices of the form @xmath26 where the group composition is given by matrix multiplication .",
    "note that as a point set @xmath25 is isomorphic to @xmath27 , and that @xmath25 has the structure of a graded nilpotent lie group .",
    "the grading is induced by the lie algebra @xmath28 of @xmath25 , which is of the form @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 = v_2 $ ] .",
    "more generally , we will consider carnot groups .",
    "a carnot group is a nilpotent lie group @xmath33 whose lie algebra is carrying a grading such that @xmath34 with @xmath35 = v_{s+1}$ ] for @xmath36 and @xmath37 = 0 $ ] for all @xmath38 . for our work , we will consider carnot manifolds which will be defined to be riemannian manifolds which carry such a grading structure on their tangent bundle .    in this thesis",
    ", we will use the geometric approach by dirac operators to discuss whether one can construct spectral triples on compact carnot manifolds , which furnish the hausdorff dimension of @xmath22 and the carnot - carathodory metric of @xmath39 .",
    "we will indeed be able to construct so - called _ horizontal dirac operators _ @xmath1 acting on a horizontal clifford bundle @xmath40 over a carnot manifold @xmath0 in analogy to classical dirac operators in a quite general setting . in a frame @xmath41 of the horizontal distribution of a carnot manifold",
    "such an operator will have the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the clifford action of @xmath19 and @xmath44 is an endomorphism on the bundle .",
    "then indeed the carnot - carathodory metric can be detected from @xmath1 , as we will show in detail , and it does not matter if one uses the lipschitz functions with respect to the carnot - carathodory metric or the smooth functions for the dense sub - algebra of @xmath45 appearing in connes metric formula .",
    "but we will see that these operators are not hypoelliptic , which means that they do not have a compact resolvent ( arising from pseudodifferential calculus ) .",
    "hence they do not furnish a spectral triple , providing us the unexpected result that the theory of spectral triples does not apply to the carnot manifolds @xmath22 in the way one would expect .    after introducing horizontal dirac operators and proving the metric formula",
    ", we will construct a class of examples .",
    "to this end we consider local homogeneous spaces of carnot groups , which arise from the left - action of a lattice sub - group @xmath46 of a carnot group @xmath33 .",
    "we call these closed carnot manifold @xmath47 compact carnot nilmanifolds .",
    "then the idea is to consider the submersion @xmath48 and to define a horizontal clifford module and a horizontal dirac operator @xmath1 by pulling back the spinor bundle and the dirac operator from a spin structure on @xmath49 .",
    "for the case where @xmath50 , we will be able to calculate the spectrum of this horizontal dirac operator completely . to do this",
    ", we adapt an argument by christian br to our situation(@xcite ) : br decomposes the spinor bundle belonging to a classical dirac operator on a heisenberg nilmanifold @xmath51 into its irreducible components under which the operator is invariant . from these irreducible components ,",
    "he is able to calculate the spectrum of the dirac operators by means of the representation theory of the heisenberg group .    in our case",
    ", the horizontal clifford bundle decomposes in the same way .",
    "we will present these calculations in detail , and afterwards we will deduce that our horizontal pull - back dirac operator @xmath1 on a compact carnot nilmanifold possesses at least one infinite dimensional eigenspace , hence it can not have a compact resolvent . in spite of",
    "that we will be able to detect the hausdorff dimension of @xmath22 in the heisenberg group case from the asymptotic behavior of the non - degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath1 .",
    "we will also extend this approach to the setting of the compact nilmanifold of a general carnot group @xmath33 , where we will show that in the spectral decomposition of such a group there is at least one infinite dimensional eigenspace .",
    "the reason for this is that in the spectral decomposition of @xmath1 there is at least one subspace isomorphic to the space of @xmath52-sections on a horizontal clifford bundle belonging to a group of nilpotency step @xmath53 . on this subspace , we will be able to detect an infinite dimensional eigenspace of the horizontal pull - back dirac operator from the heisenberg case .",
    "further we will see that the problem we detected in this concrete example is not due to a bad choice of the horizontal dirac operator .",
    "in fact it is a general phenomenon : we will argue for that using techniques from pseudodifferential calculus .",
    "there is a calculus invented by richard beals and peter greiner ( see @xcite ) on heisenberg manifolds , from which it can be derived that hypoellipticity of a ( self - adjoint ) operator of positive order implies that it has a compact resolvent and that furthermore the hausdorff dimension of the heisenberg manifold can be detected by the eigenvalue asymptotics of this operator .",
    "we will prove in this thesis that any horizontal dirac operator on an arbitrary carnot manifold can not be hypoelliptic .",
    "this is a big difference to the classical case , where any dirac operator is elliptic .    on the way",
    ", we will develop a criterion for the non - hypoellipticity of an arbitrary graded differential operator of the from @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a frame of @xmath56 which is forming a graded nilpotent lie algebra @xmath57 .",
    "as soon as there is a graded differential operator @xmath58 induced by a projection @xmath59 of @xmath57 onto a lower dimensional lie algebra @xmath60 , which is not hypoelliptic , then @xmath5 can not be hypoelliptic .",
    "this criterion will serve us well , since we will be able to reduce the problem of showing general non - hypoellipticity of a horizontal dirac operator to the heisenberg case . in the heisenberg case",
    "we have a complete characterization of hypoellipticity of horizontal laplacians arising from the representation theory of the heisenberg group , from which we will be able to exclude that a horizontal dirac operator is hypoelliptic .    finally , once having introduced the heisenberg pseudodifferential calculus , we make use of this calculus and show how hypoelliptic heisenberg pseudodifferential operators furnishing a spectral triple and detecting in addition the hausdorff dimension of the heisenberg manifold can be constructed .",
    "we will suggest a few concrete operators , but it remains unclear whether one can detect or at least estimate the carnot - carathodory metric from them .",
    "but we will show that the carnot - carathodory metric can be detected by horizontal laplacians instead of horizontal dirac operators via the formula @xmath61,f\\right ] \\right\\| \\leq 1 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] hence , maybe in this case the second order operators are the right operators to look at when we want to do non - commutative geometry on carnot manifolds .",
    "we conclude the thesis with some approaches from which one may be able to estimate or to approximate the connes metric by first order heisenberg pseudodifferential operators , and we present some criteria from which such an estimate would follow .    the structure of this thesis will be the following .    * in chapter 1 ,",
    "we introduce the notion of spectral triples , their metric dimension and the connes metric , and state a few well - known examples .",
    "then we will turn to the more general approach by mark rieffel of compact quantum order - unit spaces and prove a few criteria to detect convergence of a family of spectral triples to such a compact quantum metric space ( which does not necessarily have to be a spectral triple ) .",
    "* in chapter 2 , we give an overview of sub - riemannian geometry and carnot manifolds .",
    "we introduce the carnot - carathodory metric and state some important theorems in this context . the sections 2.3 and 2.4 serve to introduce the concept of a levi form and of certain submersions between carnot groups which will be of importance later .",
    "* in chapter 3 , we construct the horizontal dirac operator .",
    "we start by analyzing horizontal connections , which will be the connections we want a horizontal clifford bundle to be compatible with .",
    "then we construct a self - adjoint horizontal dirac operator on these bundles . in preparation of what we need",
    "later we will calculate its square locally and we will state a proposition about the eigenvalues of certain sums of clifford matrices . finally , in section 3.3 , we will show that any horizontal dirac operator on a carnot manifold @xmath0 detects the carnot - carathodory metric via connes metric formula , since the norm of the commutator @xmath62 $ ] coincides with the lip - norm of @xmath63 with respect to the carnot - carathodory metric .",
    "we will also show that the metric is already detected by the smooth functions on @xmath0 . * in chapter 4",
    ", we treat in detail the example of nilmanifolds @xmath47 from carnot groups , arising from the left action of the standard lattice .",
    "first we construct a horizontal dirac operator on @xmath0 by pulling back the spinor bundle of the horizontal torus .",
    "then it is our aim to show that this horizontal dirac operator possesses infinite dimensional eigenspaces .",
    "therefore we use an approach which was presented by christian br and bernd amman ( @xcite , @xcite ) for the case of the classical dirac operator on heisenberg nilmanifolds to find a spectral decomposition of the horizontal clifford bundle @xmath40 which is invariant under @xmath1 . for the case of a general carnot group",
    ", we find that one part of this decomposition is isomorphic to the horizontal clifford bundle belonging to a horizontal pull - back operator of a carnot nilmanifold of lower commutator step .",
    "for the case of heisenberg nilmanifold ( where the horizontal distribution is of co - dimension 1 ) we will be able to calculate all eigenvalues of @xmath1 from the approach by br and ammann , and we will detect that @xmath1 has an infinite - dimensional kernel .",
    "but in spite of that we will show that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath0 can still be detected by these eigenvalues for the case @xmath64 . in section 4.4",
    "we will put all these results together to show that on any carnot nilmanifold arising from the left - action of the standard lattice sub - group of @xmath33 the horizontal dirac operator we constructed has an infinite dimensional kernel . * in chapter 5 , we introduce the heisenberg pseudodifferential calculus while referring to richard beals and peter greiner ( @xcite ) and to raphal ponge .",
    "we will discuss symbol classes , composition of operators , parametrices and the role of hypoellipticity .",
    "finally we mention the well - known results that hypoellipticity in the heisenberg calculus implies the existence of complex powers and certain eigenvalue asymptotics . * in chapter 6",
    ", we show that the absence of a compact resolvent detected in chapter 4 for a specific class of examples is of general nature .",
    "in particular we show that any horizontal dirac operator is not hypoelliptic .",
    "therefore we first review some classical hypoellipticity theorems with special attention to the case of heisenberg manifolds .",
    "then in section 6.2 we prove a theorem from which hypoellipticity can be excluded for certain graded differential operators by going back to a graded differential operator acting on a lower dimensional carnot group .",
    "we will present some consequences which arise from going back to the heisenberg case via this reduction : this reduction criterion provides us with the possibility to exclude hypoellipticity of an arbitrary graded differential operator by looking at the levi form of its underlying graded lie algebra .",
    "finally , we will apply the reduction criterion to show that an arbitrary horizontal dirac operator can not be hypoelliptic . * in chapter 7",
    ", we discuss the possibility of constructing spectral triples by taking square roots of horizontal laplacians and the question if one can get any metric information from these spectral triples .",
    "first we show how the application of heisenberg calculus furnishes spectral triples , and we suggest a few operators being not too far away from the horizontal dirac operator which produce spectral triples . in section 7.2 , we show that the carnot - carathodory metric can be detected by any horizontal laplacian , while the business is much more difficult if we want to detect the metric from an arbitrary first - order hypoelliptic and self - adjoint heisenberg operator .",
    "unfortunately , all we can present concerning the last question are some criteria and some ideas which might approximate the carnot - carathodory metric by metrics arising from spectral triples , but so far we have not been able to prove such an approximation or estimate completely .",
    "before starting with the text of the thesis , there must be some time to say thank you to all the people who supported me during the last three years .",
    "first of all , i want to express my gratitude to my advisor elmar schrohe who was always interested in my work and found time for discussion , no matter how busy he was .",
    "he supported me all the time and motivated me , especially during the times when i got stuck with my work .",
    "i am deeply grateful to the members of the institute of analysis and the graduiertenkolleg 1643 for a warm and friendly atmosphere at work and many interesting discussions , not only on mathematics .",
    "i found some wonderful friends there !",
    "in particular i have to mention magnus goffeng in this context , a great mathematician , who supported my work with many discussions and hints .",
    "he found the time to proofread this thesis and made some really helpful remarks .",
    "further more i say thank you to erik christensen for hosting me in copenhagen for two months , and to christian br for accepting the task of being the second referee for this thesis .",
    "and it is an important matter to me to send some special thanks to natascha krienen and susanne rudolph , not only for taking care of all the administrative stuff but also for being the `` good souls '' of the graduiertenkolleg and the institute .",
    "thanks for financial supports are adressed to the dfg , since for most of the time of my phd studies i was a member of the graduiertenkolleg 1643 - analysis , geometry and string theory .",
    "but i think i would never have finished this thesis without all the support from my friends and my parents .",
    "finally my gratitude towards my dear wife susanne can not be expressend in words : she really had a hard time with me during the last months listening to all of my lamentation , but nonetheless she always kept on encouraging me and giving me amounts of love .",
    "the intention of the first chapter of this thesis is to introduce the concepts of non - commutative geometry we want to consider . in section 1.1",
    "we will present the concept of a spectral triple introduced by alain connes , which describes the geometry of a space in non - commutative geometry .",
    "this will only be a rough introduction covering only the notion of dimension and metric arising from a spectral triple , since these are the objects we are interested in . after defining these objects",
    ", we will give a few classical examples for commutative spectral triples to motivate the work of this thesis .",
    "the carnot - carathodory spaces which we want to examine from the point of view of non - commutative geometry will be treated in chapter 2 .",
    "since it will turn out that we do not get spectral triples in the sense of connes from our constructions , we will state a modified definition of a degenerate spectral triple , to denote an object being a spectral triple except for a degeneration of certain eigenspaces of its dirac operator . later in chapter 4",
    "we will see that this definition fits in our situation .",
    "besides that , in section 1.2 we will present the more general concept of compact quantum metric spaces , which was introduced by mark rieffel and which only provides metric information in the abstract setting of lip - norms . a lip - norm can arise from an operator which does not provide a spectral triple , as it will be the case for our situation .",
    "we will close section 1.2 by some simple observations we made leading to a sufficient criterion for the convergence of a sequence of compact quantum metric spaces to a certain given space . in detail , we show that the metrics @xmath65 arising from a family of lip - norms @xmath66 converge to a given metric @xmath67 , if the corresponding lip - norms converge to the lip - norm @xmath68 corresponding to @xmath67 in a uniform way",
    ". we will refer to these observations in the final chapter of this thesis , where we will be in the situation that we have a family of spectral triples providing metrics close to the metric we want to discover . but the desired metric itself will be detected by an operator which does not furnish a spectral triple",
    ".      we will give a rough overview about the theory of spectral triples now , mentioning only the concepts we will use in this thesis .",

    "first of all , we want to return to the horizontal dirac operator and show that this theory can not be applied to @xmath1 , since @xmath1 is not hypoelliptic .",
    "as we saw in the last chapter , the condition of hypoellipticity allows us to define complex powers of a self - adjoint heisenberg pseudodifferential operator within the heisenberg calculus .",
    "since operators of negative heisenberg order on a compact carnot manifold are compact , one can argue that a hypoelliptic graded differential operator has a compact resolvent .",
    "this means that if a horizontal dirac operator @xmath1 acting on a compact carnot manifold @xmath0 is hypoelliptic , condition ( ii ) for a spectral triple will be fulfilled on @xmath1584 .",
    "but in chapter 4 we already constructed a horizontal dirac operator on an arbitrary compact carnot nilmanifold which does not have a compact resolvent .",
    "the aim of this chapter is to show a generalization of the results of chapter 4 in the setting of pseudodifferential calculus : we show that any horizontal dirac operator on a carnot manifold is not hypoelliptic . from this",
    "we will draw the conclusion that a horizontal dirac operator does not have a compact resolvent , and hence does not furnish a spectral triple .",
    "we start this chapter by reviewing some well - known hypoellipticity criteria , starting with hrmanders _ sum - of - squares theorem _ and leading to the _ rockland condition _ , which states an equivalence between hypoellipticity of a graded differential operator and the non - degeneracy in the irreducible representations of its associated lie algebra",
    ". then we will draw special attention to the situation where this lie algebra is a heisenberg algebra , since in this situation one has a good classification for the hypoellipticity of horizontal laplacians .",
    "this will pay off , because in the second section we develop a criterion to exclude hypoellipticity of a graded differential operator by reducing the case to the co - dimension @xmath98 case .",
    "similar to the argument given in chapter 4 for a specific example on compact carnot nilmanifolds , we will make use of the submersions between graded nilpotent lie algebras introduced in section 2.4 .    finally , in section 6.3 we prove that any horizontal dirac operator is not hypoelliptic .",
    "this follows quickly from the previous work by considering its square .",
    "the development of hypoellipticity criteria for certain differential operators was a great matter in the 1970s and 1980s , and there are some celebrated results .",
    "the origin of all these criteria is the famous _ sum - of - squares theorem _ by lars hrmander ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ thm hormander sum of squares ] let @xmath1585 be homogeneous vector fields on @xmath56 with real @xmath339-coefficients on an open set @xmath1586 and @xmath1587 real valued .",

    "@xmath91    the problem is that this theorem only works for vector fields with real coefficients , so it will not apply to our case of the square of a horizontal dirac operator where the clifford action causes complex coefficients . during the following years",

    "we will describe this connection now .    as we noted in section 2.2 ,",
    "a graded differential operator is an operator of the form @xmath1606 where @xmath338 is a polynomial with matrix - valued @xmath339 coefficients and where @xmath334 is a frame for the vector space @xmath287 appearing in the grading @xmath34 of a graded lie algebra @xmath57 .",
    "if the coefficients of @xmath5 are constant , this suggests to consider @xmath5 as an element of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath344 of @xmath57 .",

    "let @xmath1609 denote the unitary dual of @xmath33 , which is the space of all irreducible unitary representations of @xmath33 .",
    "using the above concept , there is a representation theoretic criterion which characterizes the hypoellipticity of graded differential operators completely .",
    "we will now state this criterion , which is called the _ rockland condition _ since it was developed by charles rockland @xcite for heisenberg algebras .",
    "b. helffer and j. nourrigat extended the rockland condition to the case of arbitrary graded nilpotent lie algebras ( see @xcite or also @xcite ) .",

    "<S> therefore we construct self - adjoint horizontal dirac operators @xmath1 and show that each horizontal dirac operator detects the metric via connes formula , but we also find that in no case these operators are hypoelliptic , which means they fail to have a compact resolvent .    </S>",
    "<S> first we consider an example on compact carnot nilmanifolds in detail , where we present a construction for a horizontal dirac operator arising via pullback from the dirac operator on the torus . following an approach by christian br to decompose the horizontal clifford bundle </S>",
    "<S> , we detect that this operator has an infinite dimensional kernel . </S>",
    "<S> but in spite of this , in the case of heisenberg nilmanifolds we will be able to discover the graded dimension from the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of this horizontal dirac operator . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards we turn to the general case , showing that any horizontal dirac operator fails to be hypoelliptic . doing this </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a criterion from which hypoellipticity of certain graded differential operators can be excluded by considering the situation on a heisenberg manifold , for which a complete characterization of hypoellipticity in known by the rockland condition .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how spectral triples can be constructed from horizontal laplacians via the heisenberg pseudodifferential calculus developed by richard beals and peter greiner . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a few of these constructions , and discuss under which assumptions it may be possible to get an equivalent metric to the carnot - carathodory metric from these operators . in addition , we mention a formula by which the carnot - carathodory metric can be detected from arbitrary horizontal laplacians .    </S>",
