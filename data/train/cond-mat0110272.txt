    "driven by the modern tools of molecular biology and by the opening perspectives of nanotechnology , there is currently a strong interest into understanding all the mechanisms by which systems at a molecular scale can efficiently convert chemical or light energy into mechanical energy .",
    "such systems are often called `` molecular motors '' , and are at the root of biological processes such as muscle contraction , cell motility , and several intracellular transport processes @xcite .",
    "contrary to ordinary engines , these molecular motors are conceived to work at a single temperature .",
    "moreover they essentially exploit brownian motion , converting its random behaviour into an ordered directional motion by means of some physical mechanism related with energy dissipation .",
    "an example of such a mechanism is the so - called `` brownian ratchet effect '' @xcite .",
    "artificial brownian ratchets at microscopic scales have been proposed for a variety of technological applications , and in some cases they have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "very recently , the first steps toward engineering truly molecular motors have been taken @xcite .    within this field , a specific line of investigation",
    "is aimed at developing physical models that capture the essential features of these molecular systems but that are simple enough to be easily understood and studied @xcite .",
    "many models are focused on a very simple ideal system : a point - like particle undergoing overdamped brownian motion under the effect of molecular friction and of a periodic energy potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the particle coordinate . at a given constant absolute temperature @xmath2 , friction and brownian diffusion",
    "are characterized by a single quantity that can be taken to be the friction coefficient @xmath3 or equivalently the diffusion constant @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is boltzmann constant . in this case",
    ", it is well known that even if @xmath0 is asymmetric for @xmath6 , as for example in the case of a saw - tooth potential , no directional long - range motion can be induced unless the system is driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by some mechanism @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest proposed mechanisms to induce directional motion is a random switching of the system between two internal states characterized by different potentials , say @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite ( see also @xcite for a detailed two - state model of kinesin ) . in other words ,",
    "the particle is subject to a fluctuating potential , where the fluctuations are described as sudden switches from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and backwards .",
    "these switches are not completely random , but obey to stochastic laws in which detailed balance and hence thermodynamic equilibrium is broken . for example",
    ", one must assign the probability per unit time @xmath9 of having a nonthermal forced transition from state @xmath10 to state @xmath11 , associated with some input of free energy .",
    "moreover , there is the probability per unit time of having spontaneous transitions associated with thermal equilibrium and therefore obeying to detailed balance .",
    "one may prove for this system that the correlated energy potential fluctuations associated with the random transitions may result into a nonzero average force @xmath12 acting on the particle and therefore into its drift at a constant average velocity @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this long - range motion is the mechanical output of the motor , whereas the ( chemical or optical ) free energy input arises from the nonthermal state transitions .",
    "the direction of this motion is dictated by the asymmetry of one or both the potentials @xmath14 .",
    "however , a directional motion can be induced also by asymmetric transition rates @xcite .    the possibility of a difference in the friction coefficient ( or diffusion constant ) experienced by the particle in the two internal states , i.e. , @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) , was considered in previous works but only with a passive role . in particular ,",
    "if taken alone , this difference can not give rise to a nonzero average force and velocity of the motor .",
    "in other words a fluctuation of friction in the presence of a constant force potential can not power the motor .    in this paper",
    "we show that a stochastic fluctuation of friction induced by asymmetric transition rates actually can give rise to a nonzero average force @xmath12 .",
    "unexpectedly , however , this steady average force does not generate any long - range motion of the particle , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , it can be shown that the average friction force experienced by the particle , owing to the fluctuations in the friction coefficient , does not vanish even for @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , a balance between the average nonzero force arising from the ( constant ) potential @xmath0 and the average friction force is established at @xmath17 . at first sight",
    "it seems therefore that there is no possibility at all of obtaining motion and mechanical work out of brownian motion with fluctuating friction coefficient .",
    "we show in the following that this is not completely true .",
    "let us consider explicitly the two `` external '' bodies that interact with the particle and provide respectively the potential forces and the friction forces acting on the particle . in the following , we call these two bodies the `` sources '' of the potential and friction forces .",
    "usually , in discussing molecular motor models , these bodies are considered as large systems that do not move . however , this picture is not always realistic .",
    "for example , in biological actomyosin motors the actin ( `` thin '' ) filaments ( usually considered as the source of potential forces in the framework of these models ) are displaced relative to myosin ( `` thick '' ) filaments by the action of many myosin motors .",
    "it is this displacement the actual output of the motor .",
    "therefore , we are led naturally to consider also the motion of these `` large '' bodies , besides the particle itself , in analyzing the mechanical output of these systems .",
    "the whole motor system must actually be seen then as a three - body dynamical system .",
    "now , the bodies generating the opposite friction and potential forces acting on the particle are also , by reaction , experiencing opposite nonvanishing average forces .",
    "therefore these two large bodies can be set in motion relative to each other , unless they are blocked by some constraint or they actually coincide .",
    "in other words , the motor particle undergoing brownian motion with a fluctuating friction coefficient can induce a long - range relative displacement of the two bodies with which it is interacting . in the process",
    ", the particle itself may also undergo a directional long - range displacement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe a simple model of a three body - system that converts chemical ( or optical ) free energy into mechanical work by exploiting the brownian motion of a particle that experiences stochastic sudden fluctuations of its friction coefficient between two values . in section",
    "iii we solve analytically the equations of this system for a specific choice of the potential landscape and transition probabilities .",
    "we also performed some numerical studies to analyze more general cases . in section iv , in order to show how the idea of a fluctuating - friction molecular motor can be useful in the context of biological systems , we apply our model to the actomyosin system .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section v.",
    "consider three bodies denoted as a , b , and c , corresponding to the motor active unit ( the `` particle '' ) , the potential source , and the friction source , respectively ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we start working in a frame of reference @xmath18 ( we may consider it `` fixed '' , for the sake of simplicity ) in which c is motionless while a and b move , their motion being described by coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the motion of b is supposed to be deterministic , i.e. , its brownian fluctuations are neglected , for example because it is a comparatively larger body . for the time being , we assume that b moves at a constant velocity @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 . the motion of the small particle a is instead stochastic , due to brownian fluctuations .",
    "moreover , we assume that it is overdamped , i.e. , inertia of a can be neglected .",
    "therefore , to each internal state @xmath23 of the motor we may associate an evolving probability density @xmath24 . the interaction between a and b",
    "is described by a potential @xmath25 that is time - dependent , because b is moving .",
    "it is therefore convenient to switch to another inertial frame of reference @xmath26 that is comoving with b , thus introducing a new relative coordinate @xmath27 in terms of which the potential @xmath14 is stationary .",
    "characterizes the interaction between body b and the particle a , where @xmath1 is their relative position .",
    "body c interacts with the particle via friction . ]",
    "the stochastic dynamics of body a can then be described by the following pair of coupled smoluchowski equations : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the probability current in the frame @xmath26 and @xmath30 is the net rate of transitions to state @xmath10 at position @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the diffusion constant in state @xmath10 .",
    "the first two terms in equation ( [ eqj ] ) are the standard diffusion and drift currents , respectively .",
    "the last term appears because we are working in a frame of reference , @xmath26 , that is moving with respect to the source of friction ( normally , overdamped brownian motion is studied in the privileged reference frame of the fluid providing the friction ) .",
    "formally , it can be derived starting from equations ( [ maineq ] ) written in the fixed frame @xmath18 , by applying the galilei coordinate transformation @xmath34 to the @xmath35 term .",
    "physically , it describes the drift current induced by the drag force generated by the friction source body c that  in the frame @xmath26  is moving at constant speed @xmath36 .",
    "this term would arise , for example , when describing the brownian motion of a particle in a viscous fluid that is flowing at constant speed @xmath36 .    for comparing the contributions of fluctuating friction and fluctuating potential , we allow here for both of them to depend on the internal state .",
    "for the transition rates we take @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the lifetime of state 2 ( state 1 is assumed to be stable , while @xmath39 is the rate of spontaneous transitions @xmath40 ) .",
    "the latter follows from assuming that state transitions are local , i.e. , do not involve a variation of @xmath1 , and thermal - induced transitions from level 1 to level 2 are negligible ( because the level energy difference is much larger than @xmath41 ) .",
    "note moreover that we are assuming @xmath42 to depend only on the relative coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "thus far we have made no hypothesis on the periodicity of @xmath0 and @xmath42 . actually , this is not a strictly necessary condition in our model , as we will discuss later .",
    "however , we assume in the following that the functions @xmath14 and @xmath42 are periodic , owing to the extended periodic structure of body b. denoting then by @xmath43 the half - period in the variable @xmath1 , we may limit our solution to the interval @xmath44 $ ] by imposing the periodic boundary conditions @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the distribution functions @xmath47 are normalized by the condition @xmath48 .    in the stationary regime ,",
    "when @xmath49 , the condition @xmath50 combined with equations ( [ maineq ] ) implies that the total current @xmath51 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this first - integral can be exploited to reduce equations ( [ maineq ] ) and ( [ eqj ] ) to a set of three first - order differential equations in the unknown functions @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 playing the role of an eigenvalue .",
    "then , the three remaining periodic boundary conditions together with the normalization condition uniquely determine the unknown functions and the eigenvalue @xmath54 . in this way",
    ", the problem can be easily solved numerically for any functional shape of @xmath14 and @xmath42 and for a given velocity @xmath21 . for the case of piecewise linear functions shown in figure 2",
    ", the problem can also be solved analytically , as discussed in section iii .     and",
    "transition probability @xmath42 that allows a fully analytical solution of our model .",
    "notice that , owing to the relative phase of the two functions , the @xmath6 symmetry is broken .",
    "this symmetry breaking determines the direction of the long range motion . ]",
    "once solved the stationary random - walk problem , we are interested in computing the average force @xmath55 that b exerts on a , given by @xmath56 and the average friction force @xmath57 arising in the interaction with c , given by @xmath58 ( the latter is easily understood by considering that @xmath59 is the current in the fixed frame @xmath18 , i.e. , the current relative to body c ) . by exploiting equations ( [ eqj ] ) ,",
    "it is straightforward to prove that @xmath60 , reflecting the balance of all forces acting on the element a of the motor . due to this balance",
    ", the particle a does not acquire any momentum ( that it could not accumulate , since its inertia is negligible ) . on the other hand , by interacting with b and c , a mediates a continuous transfer of momentum from the friction source body c to the potential source body b. this transfer is expressed by the reaction force @xmath61 acting on b. in the following , for brevity , we denote the latter just by @xmath62 . a convenient expression of @xmath12 , obtained from equation ( [ eqf1 ] ) , is the following : @xmath63-\\bar{\\eta}v_b , \\label{eqf2}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the average current in state 2 and @xmath65 is the average friction coefficient .",
    "the average relative velocity @xmath66 of the active element a in the frame @xmath26 can be evaluated as @xmath67 .",
    "if we set @xmath68 and there are no potential fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath69 , then @xmath70 , for any functional form of @xmath0 .",
    "to prove it , let us introduce the function @xmath71e^{u(x)/kt}.\\ ] ] the periodic boundary conditions and the periodicity of @xmath0 imply that @xmath72 .",
    "however , from equations ( [ eqj ] ) we find the relation @xmath73 which after an integration gives @xmath74 this means that there can be no long range displacement of the particle a with respect to the potential source for @xmath68 , as anticipated in the introduction . from equation ( [ eqf2 ] )",
    "one can see , however , that the vanishing of @xmath54 does not imply the vanishing of the force @xmath12 if @xmath16 , as the average current @xmath75 does not necessarily vanishes for @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , as illustrated graphically in figure 3 , the system may achieve a stationary nonequilibrium state in which there is a continuous cycling between state 1 , in which the particle in the average moves one way , and state 2 , in which in the average the particle moves the opposite way by the same amount .",
    "the net particle displacement vanishes but , owing to the different friction coefficients in the two states , the average friction force does not .",
    "the actual achievement of this stationary state is proved in section iii for the particular choice of @xmath0 and @xmath42 shown in figure 2 . in general",
    ", we found numerically that @xmath12 does not vanish if the nonthermal transition probability @xmath42 is described by a periodic function that is shifted with respect to the potential @xmath0 , so that the resulting overall transition rates @xmath30 are asymmetric . note that if one sets @xmath76 , then @xmath77 , i.e. , particle a will acquire a directional motion relative to the other two bodies .    ) .",
    "the potential @xmath0 and the transition probability @xmath42 are as in figure 2 . although the total current vanishes , because @xmath78 , the contribution to the total friction force @xmath79 is nonzero if @xmath15 . ]",
    "let us now come back to body b. thus far we have simply assumed that b is moving at constant speed @xmath21 , and we have thus determined the average force @xmath80 that the motor develops on b itself .",
    "now we can use this information to write a self - consistent equation for the ( deterministic ) motion of b at steady - state , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an additional friction coefficient associated with the motion of body b , and @xmath83 is the external load . in particular , setting @xmath68 in equation ( [ eqb ] ) we obtain the `` stalling '' force @xmath84 .",
    "the maximum velocity @xmath85 is instead obtained by solving the force - balance equation with @xmath86 .",
    "note that we are assuming here that body b responds only to the average force @xmath87 , and not to the instantaneous fluctuating force exchanged with a. as we said , this assumption is justified for example if b is much larger and therefore slower than a , so that it responds only to its time - averaged motion and ignores its fast brownian fluctuations .",
    "another case that justifies this approach occurs when b interacts simultaneously with many replicas of a and therefore it responds only to their total force ( proportional to the average force of a single motor ) .",
    "however , it should be noted also that this simplifying assumption of our model is not essential to our main conclusions and that qualitatively similar results are to be expected when brownian fluctuations of b are taken into account .",
    "one final comment is in order . at first sight",
    ", one could be led to believe that by assuming from the start a nonzero velocity for body b we have artificially introduced a bias in the random - walk of a , and that it is only this bias that finally leads to the directional motion .",
    "that this is not the case is proved by the fact that the internal force @xmath87 does not vanish for @xmath68 .",
    "it is this force that defines the long - range motion direction . and",
    "it is this internal force that , if not counteracted by a stalling external load , eventually sets body b in motion .",
    "let us now describe some specific solutions of our model .",
    "it is convenient to use dimensionless quantities , obtained from the corresponding dimensional ones by using @xmath88 as units of length , time , and energy , respectively .",
    "we denote a dimensionless quantity by a tilde sign placed above the corresponding dimensional symbol . in particular",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 . for definiteness ,",
    "let us specialize to the case of triangular - wave potentials and square - wave transition probability shown in figure 2 , i.e. , @xmath93\\tilde{u}_i\\tilde{x}$ ] and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the unitary step function . in this case",
    "all results are analytical .",
    "the general expression of @xmath96 is omitted here for brevity , but we give its linear limit obtained for small excitation probability @xmath97 and velocity @xmath98 .",
    "the stalling force is @xmath99 with @xmath100\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde{\\bar{j}}_2&=&-\\frac{\\tilde{i}_0{\\tilde{u}}_1{\\tilde{u}}_2\\tilde{\\tau}}{4\\delta } \\left[\\frac{1}{{\\tilde{u}}_1\\tilde{\\tau } } + \\frac{{\\tilde{u}}_2}{2}-\\frac{\\cosh\\delta\\cosh\\frac{{\\tilde{u}}_1}{2}-\\cosh\\frac{{\\tilde{u}}_d}{2 } } { \\sinh\\frac{{\\tilde{u}}_1}{2}\\sinh\\delta/\\delta}\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .    for @xmath104 and @xmath16 ( friction fluctuations only , no potential fluctuations ) , @xmath105 and",
    "the stalling force is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , everything else being fixed , the direction and strength of the force and of the ensuing motion is determined by the variation of diffusion constant ( or friction coefficient ) induced by the state fluctuations .",
    "the nonlinear behaviour of the stalling force @xmath107 versus pumping intensity @xmath97 and lifetime @xmath108 is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the graph shows that there is an optimal @xmath108 , i.e. , an optimal ratio between the excited state lifetime and diffusion time .",
    "this optimal value decreases for increasing @xmath97 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that exhibited by the fluctuating - potential models @xcite .     versus pumping intensity @xmath97 and lifetime @xmath108 ( dimensionless quantities ) , for @xmath109 and @xmath110 . ]    for nonzero velocity @xmath98 , the ( linearized ) force is @xmath111 where @xmath112.\\ ] ] therefore the maximum velocity of the motor is @xmath113    for @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( potential fluctuations only , no friction fluctuations ) , a nonzero current @xmath116 is established , i.e. , a long - range displacement of body a with respect to body b occurs .",
    "if body b is also fixed ( i.e. , it is linked to body c ) , this case reduces to the `` standard '' one discussed for example in reference @xcite .",
    "the average speed of body a will then be @xmath117 .",
    "an interesting difference between the two cases of fluctuating potential and fluctuating friction is given by the behaviour of @xmath107 for large potential energies , i.e. , @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath115 the force shows a thermal - activated behaviour , with @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the minimum of @xmath121 and @xmath122 . on the contrary , when @xmath16 and @xmath123 a term survives that decays only as @xmath124 .",
    "this behaviour is evident in figure 5 .",
    "it can be explained by considering that for @xmath115 the force is proportional to the total average current @xmath116 . to contribute to @xmath116",
    "the motor moving element must overcome the potential barrier by acquiring sufficient thermal energy and the probability for this to happen is proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "in the case of @xmath16 , the force acquires another term proportional to the average current @xmath126 that need not vanish for @xmath105 .",
    "it corresponds to a circulation of the particle that moves preferentially forward when in state 1 and backward when in state 2 .",
    "however , the motor does not have to reach the potential maximum and therefore to be thermally activated .",
    "this cycling between the two states and the resulting currents are schematically described in figure 3 .",
    "( linearized in @xmath97 ) versus potential depth @xmath121 for the two cases of fluctuating potential ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 , solid line ) and fluctuating friction ( @xmath129 and @xmath130 , dashed line ) . in both examples",
    "@xmath131 . ]",
    "we did not develop this model having in mind a specific biological application . nonetheless , it is possible that basic features of some biological molecular mechanism be captured by our model .",
    "the basic working mechanism of important biological molecular motors is still under debate @xcite , so that there is room for proposing new models and offering different perspectives of this problem .",
    "therefore we show in the following how our model can be applied to describing a biological molecular motor . however , we stress that we are not attempting here to build a `` realistic '' model , our purpose being only to illustrate the basic idea .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the actin - myosin ii system , that is the molecular motor providing the chemomechanical coupling in muscle contraction . when a muscle is contracted , thin filaments of actin and thick filaments of myosin are displaced relative to each other by the concerted action of many myosin `` heads '' .",
    "a myosin head is a molecular unit linked to the myosin filament through a flexible molecular `` arm '' ( or `` neck '' ) and interacting via weak intermolecular interactions with the actin filament @xcite .",
    "a schematic picture of the actomyosin system is in figure 6 .",
    "[ @xmath132 in ( a ) , @xmath133 in ( b ) ] . in ( a )",
    "are also shown the correspondence rules that link our model ( bodies a , b , and c ) to the real system . in ( b )",
    "is also shown the single - well energy @xmath0 characterizing the deformation of the lever arm versus the deformation coordinate @xmath1 giving the relative positions of bodies a and b. the `` brownian power - stroke '' occurs when the system switches to the high friction state when @xmath132 ( a ) and then relaxes its deformation energy . ]    in reference @xcite the actomyosin system is modeled by associating the myosin head with the particle ( body a ) , the actin filament with the source of potential ( body b ) , and the surrounding fluid or the actin filament itself with the friction source ( body c ) .",
    "the myosin filament is treated as an additional passive `` load '' dragged on by the moving myosin head .",
    "the potential @xmath0 describing the adsorption interaction of the head with the actin filament is periodic and asymmetric reflecting the underlying periodic and asymmetric structure of the filament . attaching - detaching of the head to / from the actin filament",
    "are described as sudden changes in the potential landscape .    here",
    "we propose a different set of correspondence rules in order to apply our model to the actomyosin system , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "we still identify the brownian particle ( body a ) with the myosin head .",
    "however , we model here the weak interaction between a and the actin filament as molecular friction , thus identifying the actin filament with body c. in a limit case , the low friction state allows almost free sliding of a on c , while the high friction state impedes any sliding .",
    "the myosin filament plays instead the role of body b. the potential @xmath0 is used here to model the deformation energy of the molecular arm connecting the myosin filament with the head .",
    "the function @xmath0 therefore needs not be periodic in this case , as the limited range of arm deformation constrains the particle a into a single potential well .",
    "the periodic potential formalism can be still used , however , by setting infinitely high energy barriers at @xmath134 .",
    "adenosinetriphosphate ( atp ) binding on the myosin head and its subsequent hydrolysis triggers the variation of molecular friction coefficient of the myosin head ( from high to low friction ) . by means of some suitable mechanism ( specific intermolecular interactions ) ,",
    "only when the conformation of the myosin arm is bent in a given direction , for example negative @xmath1 ( figure 6b ) , the molecule enzymatic activity is large and atp binding and hydrolysis may occur .",
    "this corresponds roughly to having @xmath135 for @xmath133 ( figure 6b ) and @xmath136 for @xmath132 ( figure 6a ) , where the rate @xmath137 is proportional to atp concentration .",
    "after an average time @xmath38 , the hydrolysis reaction has gone through its full cycle and the motor switches back to a high friction state .    given these correspondence rules ,",
    "our model predicts a continuous directional motion of the myosin motor ( head plus filament , i.e. , bodies a and b ) with respect to the actin filament ( body c ) ( of course this is a relative motion : actually none of the three bodies can be considered fixed ) .",
    "the general behaviour of the motor as a function of external load and atp concentration is in qualitative agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that no direct causal link between the atp hydrolysis and conformational transformations is introduced in our model , i.e. , the conformational changes , described in our model by the continuous variable @xmath1 , are not chemically - driven but are governed solely by brownian motion .",
    "the asymmetric transition rates allow the elastic energy stored during the brownian motion to be converted into directed long - range motion .",
    "in particular the main `` force - generating step '' occurs when the system happens to switch back to the high friction state for @xmath132 ( figure 6a ) , relaxing then its deformation energy @xmath138 by moving back to @xmath139 .",
    "this step may be considered a sort of `` brownian power - stroke '' .",
    "in contrast , our model assumes no `` chemically - driven power - stroke '' . in this sense",
    ", it differs from many other models of biological motors .",
    "a power - stroke is often modeled either as a sudden change of the elastic constant characterizing the potential @xcite , occurring as a consequence of atp - induced state transitions , or as free sliding on an asymmetric potential as in brownian ratchet models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the force - generation mechanism of our model in the limit of very high friction in state 2 and very low friction in state 1 becomes similar to that of the old model by a. f. huxley @xcite .",
    "a similar sort of `` brownian power - stroke '' is assumed also in references @xcite , in connection with the modeling of kinesin .",
    "the model presented in this paper was actually developed for a specific application , namely the recently discovered strong enhancement of the light - induced molecular reorientation taking place in dye - doped nematic liquid crystals @xcite . a more detailed treatment of our modeling of this phenomenon has been already published elsewhere @xcite , and here we limit ourselves to a brief discussion . the relationship between this optical effect and molecular motors",
    "was first pointed out by palffy - muhoray and weinan , without introducing however the possibility of an active role of fluctuating friction @xcite . in our model ,",
    "dye molecules play the role of motor particles ( body a ) and the nematic molecular director plays the role of potential source ( body b ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath1 is here the angle between the dye molecule orientation and the molecular director , so that the motor is a rotary one .",
    "the role of the friction source c is played by the translational ( centre - of - mass ) degrees of freedom of liquid crystal molecules themselves .",
    "light powers the motor by continuously promoting internal electronic transitions in the dye molecules , and the final output is a torque ( corresponding to the force @xmath12 ) acting on the molecular director and eventually causing its reorientation .",
    "there is substantial experimental evidence @xcite that the rotational friction coefficients of dye molecules in the two electronic states involved in the transitions are quite different , so that the fluctuating - friction mechanism is indeed at work .",
    "this proves that this hypothetical mechanism is actually realistic , at least in one specific example .    in this paper ,",
    "our main goal was to illustrate in a general abstract form , independent of any specific application , the idea that a stochastic fluctuation of a kinetic coefficient , such as friction , mobility , or diffusion constant , can be an effective mechanism for converting chemical ( or light ) energy into directional motion and mechanical work at the molecular scale , at which brownian fluctuations dominate .",
    "the possibility of extracting work from brownian motion by means of a suitable modulation of kinetic properties , as opposed to equilibrium potential forces , appears to be new , at least within the field of molecular motors .",
    "we believe that this concept can be profitable in several other fields , besides the nonlinear optics one .",
    "in particular , as discussed in section iv , many biological motors are still waiting for a detailed modeling , and any new idea can be very useful in the quest for complete understanding of these complex systems .",
    "similarly , in the field of nanotechnology , the possibility of driving transport via a suitable modulation of the microscopic kinetic coefficients can be an interesting design concept .    in all cases ,",
    "the relevance of this idea is further enhanced if one takes into account the high structural sensitivity of kinetic coefficients occurring commonly in activated systems , where small changes in the activation energy can lead to huge variations of the kinetic coefficients .",
