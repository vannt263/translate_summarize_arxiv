    "during the past decades , the covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) has received wide attention due to its successful descriptions of both ground - state and excited - state properties of nuclei all over the nuclear chart . in this report",
    ", we will mainly focus on our recent progress in the self - consistent relativistic random - phase approximation ( rpa ) established by using the finite - amplitude method ( fam ) @xcite .",
    "the density functional theory has been widely used in nuclear physics since the 1970s @xcite . in particular",
    ", its covariant version @xcite takes the lorentz invariance into account , and thus puts stringent restrictions on the number of parameters , achieving a consistent treatment of the spin degrees of freedom as well as the unification of the time - even and time - odd components . over the years",
    ", a large variety of nuclear phenomena have been described successfully by the cdft @xcite .",
    "the rpa @xcite is one of the leading theories applicable to both low - lying excited states and giant resonances . in the relativistic framework",
    ", the self - consistent and quantitative rpa calculations were realized after recognizing the importance of the dirac sea @xcite . from then on ,",
    "great efforts along this direction have been made @xcite .",
    "recently , a fully self - consistent relativistic rpa @xcite has been established based on the relativistic hartree - fock theory @xcite .",
    "it is shown that not only the gamow - teller resonances but also the fine structure of spin - dipole resonances can be well reproduced without any readjustment of the energy functional @xcite .",
    "this self - consistent rpa has also been applied to evaluate the isospin symmetry - breaking corrections to the superallowed @xmath0 transitions for the unitarity test of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite .",
    "recently , the corresponding quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) @xcite based on the relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory @xcite has been developed .    however , the above investigations are essentially restricted within the spherical symmetry .",
    "the conventional rpa calculations in the matrix form face a big computational challenge when the number of particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) configurations @xmath1 becomes huge .",
    "so far , the self - consistent deformed ( q)rpa in the relativistic framework was only developed by pea arteaga _",
    "_ @xcite .    as a promising solution for this computational challenge ,",
    "the so - called finite - amplitude method was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this method , the effects of residual interactions are evaluated in a numerical way by considering a finite density deviation around the ground state .",
    "in such a way , the self - consistent rpa calculations become possible with a little extension of the static hartree(-fock ) code . furthermore , by using the iterative methods for the rpa equation , the computation time is close to a linear dependence on @xmath1 , instead of a dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the diagonalization scheme @xcite .",
    "this advantage is crucial when @xmath1 becomes huge .    in the non - relativistic framework with skyrme energy density functionals ,",
    "the feasibility , accuracy , and efficiency of fam have been demonstrated for the rpa in the three - dimensionally deformed cases in the coordinate - space representation @xcite and for the qrpa in the spherical @xcite and axially deformed @xcite cases in the quasiparticle - basis representation .",
    "iterative algorithms for ( q)rpa solutions have also been developed recently , based on the arnoldi process @xcite and on the conjugate gradient method @xcite .",
    "the readers are also referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "work is now in progress for developing the self - consistent relativistic rpa by using the fam . in particular , special attentions should be paid to the unique features of covariant density functionals , including the effects of the dirac sea and the rearrangement terms for the density - dependent interactions .",
    "these rearrangement terms are usually more sophisticated than those in the skyrme functionals , and cause heavy computations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the covariant density functionals hold the lorentz invariance , which leads to the unification of their time - even and time - odd components .",
    "this makes the modification in the ground - state code straightforward .",
    "in this section , we will highlight the key formulas of the fam in cdft restricted to spherical nuclei , in particular , we will mark the most important points by the symbol @xmath4 . the detailed derivations and the meaning of notations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our starting point is the effective lagrangian density of the point - coupling relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite , which reads @xmath5 where the coupling strengths @xmath6 are analytical functions with respect to the baryonic density , @xmath7 ,    [ eq : alpha ] @xmath8    for the systems with spherical symmetry , the single - particle wave functions have the form of @xmath9 hereafter , @xmath10 indicate the single - particle wave functions in general , but @xmath11 specifically represent the eigenstates of @xmath12 ; index @xmath13 runs over all single - particle states , but indices @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) only run over the hole ( particle ) states .",
    "@xmath4 note that within this phase convention between the upper and lower components , the wave functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be simultaneously chosen as real functions for the ground - state descriptions .",
    "in contrast , for the fam built below , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 become complex functions , so one should be careful to distinguish them from their complex conjugates @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the very beginning .",
    "the radial dirac equation reads @xmath20 with the scalar and vector potentials    [ eq : sigma ] @xmath21    the rearrangement terms only contribute to the time - like component of the vector potential , which read @xmath22 the densities and currents are expressed as    [ eq : dens ] @xmath23},\\\\      \\rho_v^{(q_a)}&=          { \\frac{1}{4\\pi",

    "the static hartree(-fock ) equation , @xmath25 , \\rho ] = 0 $ ] , determines the ground - state density @xmath26 and the one - body mean - field hamiltonian @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "when a time - dependent external perturbation @xmath28 is present , the density deviation obeys the so - called time - dependent hartree(-fock ) equation . in the frequency representation , it is expressed as @xmath29+[\\delta h(\\omega)+v_{\\rm ext}(\\omega),\\rho_0],\\ ] ] as a linear response to the weak perturbation .    in practical calculations , it is convenient to adopt the single - particle orbitals to represent the density matrix , @xmath30 . the density deviation in the frequency representation can be expressed as @xmath31 with the so - called forward @xmath32 and backward @xmath33 amplitudes .",
    "it is slightly tricky that one must take the ket @xmath34 and bra @xmath35 states independent since @xmath36 is not hermitian .    in conventional rpa calculations ,",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 amplitudes are expanded on the basis of particle states , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then , one can derive the well - known rpa equation in the matrix form , @xmath39 the rpa matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 read    [ eq : ab ] @xmath42    @xmath4 rearrangement terms : the _ ph _ residual interactions @xmath43 in the fully self - consistent calculations are strictly derived from the second derivative of the energy functional .",
    "the density - dependent coupling strengths @xmath6 introduces the rearrangement terms in @xmath43 with @xmath44 or @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "they are calculated separately in the conventional rpa calculations .",
    "@xmath4 dirac sea : the relativistic rpa is equivalent to the time - dependent rmf theory in the small amplitude limit , only when the particle states @xmath15 include not only the states above the fermi surface but also the states in the dirac sea @xcite .",
    "it is due to the no - sea approximation used in the ground - state calculations .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fam was proposed as a simpler and more efficient approach to the solutions of the linear response equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) .",
    "this method does not require explicit evaluation of the residual interactions @xmath46 ( [ eq : ab ] ) . instead , by multiplying with the ket @xmath47 and bra @xmath48 of only hole states on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) , respectively , one has    [ eq : fam ] @xmath49    the @xmath50 and @xmath51 are calculated by using the finite difference with a sufficiently small number @xmath52 : @xmath53-h[{\\left<}\\phi{\\right|},{\\left|}\\phi{\\right>}])\\ ] ] with @xmath54 , and @xmath55-h[{\\left<}\\phi{\\right|},{\\left|}\\phi{\\right>}])\\ ] ] with @xmath56 .    in the coordinate space , for instance ,",

    "this is called the iterative finite - amplitude method ( i - fam ) .",
    "the practical procedure for evaluating @xmath61 and @xmath62 is following : with a given set of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , one sequentially calculates    * the nucleon densities and currents in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dens ] ) ; * the new coupling strengths in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) ; * the coulomb fields in eq .",

    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) ; * the one - body hamiltonian @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdirac ] ) .",
    "@xmath4 since now the @xmath66 and @xmath67 amplitudes are independent due to the non - hermitian nature of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , it is clear that the nucleon currents are no longer vanishing .",
    "this is the reason why the time - odd terms must be kept from the beginning .",
    "@xmath4 note that here the @xmath68 and @xmath69 amplitudes are expanded on the mesh points @xmath70 in the coordinate space .",
    "in such a way , even though the effects of the dirac sea can not be identified or isolated , these effects are properly taken into account , because the coordinate space @xmath71 provides a complete set of basis for particle states .",
    "@xmath4 in order to include both the normal and rearrangement terms in @xmath43 , one simply needs to re - calculate the coupling strengths @xmath6 and their derivatives @xmath44 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) for each given set of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "if one skips this step , this means the normal terms in @xmath43 remain , but all of the rearrangement terms are neglected .",
    "pb calculated by i - fam and m - fam .",
    "the i - fam results are shown with the dotted symbols , while the m - fam results calculated with and without the dirac sea are shown with the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",

    "taken from ref .",
    "[ fig1],width=302 ]    pb calculated by i - fam and m - fam .",
    "the i - fam results without the rearrangement terms are shown with the dotted symbols , while the m - fam results calculated with and without the rearrangement terms are shown with the solid and dash - dotted lines , respectively .",
    "taken from ref .",
    "[ fig2],width=302 ]      another usage of fam is the matrix finite - amplitude method ( m - fam ) @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the rpa matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 are explicitly constructed , but the tedious calculations concerning @xmath43 can be avoided .    the kernels @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) are directly calculated with the finite difference @xmath73-h[{\\left<}\\phi{\\right|},{\\left|}\\phi{\\right>}]),\\ ] ] by keeping all @xmath74 and @xmath75 unchanged , but slightly mixing specific orbitals @xmath76 with @xmath77 as @xmath78 . in the same way , @xmath79-h[{\\left<}\\phi{\\right|},{\\left|}\\phi{\\right>}]),\\ ] ] with a small mixing of the specific orbitals @xmath76 and @xmath77 as @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath4 to include the effects of the dirac sea , states @xmath77 run over the unoccupied states in both fermi and dirac sea .",
    "to include the effects of the rearrangement terms , one follows the same procedure as that in i - fam shown above .",
    "as illustrative calculations , we show the isoscalar giant monopole resonances ( isgmr ) in @xmath81pb , where the density - dependent point - coupling rmf parametrization dd - pc1 @xcite is used and the spherical symmetry is assumed .",
    "the effects of the dirac sea and the rearrangement terms can be examined by switching on or off the corresponding _ ph _ residual interactions .",
    "first of all , the transition strengths of isgmr in @xmath81pb calculated in the m - fam scheme with and without the dirac sea are compared in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is found that the dirac sea shows profound effects on the centroid energy and the experimental data @xcite is reproduced only when the dirac sea is taken into account .",
    "as mentioned before , the effects of the dirac sea can not be isolated in the coordinate - space representation .",
    "however , it can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the i - fam results are exactly on top of the m - fam results that include the dirac sea .",
    "this confirms that the coordinate space generates another complete set of basis for particle states and these two fam schemes are equivalent .    for the rearrangement terms ,",
    "it is tedious to calculate them in the conventional rpa calculations , in contrast , in fam these terms can be simply taken into account by re - calculating the coupling strengths @xmath6 and their derivatives @xmath44 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "the numerical cost of such a step is totally negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the transition strengths of isgmr in @xmath81pb calculated by m - fam with and without the rearrangement terms are shown , together with the i - fam results calculated without the rearrangement terms .",
    "the equivalency of these two fam schemes is demonstrated once more .",
    "quantitatively , it is found that the rearrangement effects on the centroid energies is also substantial .",
    "work is now in progress for establishing the self - consistent relativistic rpa by using the fam .",
    "it is shown that , in the present schemes , the effects of the dirac sea can be automatically taken into account in the coordinate - space representation .",
    "the rearrangement terms due to the density - dependent couplings can be also implicitly calculated without extra computational costs .",
