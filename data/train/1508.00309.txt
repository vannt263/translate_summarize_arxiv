    "hydrogen ( h ) is a ubiquitous impurity in a wide variety of semiconductors , including elemental ( e.g. , si ) and binary compound ( e.g. , gaas ) materials , which comprise the primary basis for current industrial applications . in these covalent systems , h is known to be amphoteric , forming an acceptor or donor level in @xmath1- or @xmath7-type materials , respectively @xcite . meanwhile , a recent theoretical prediction that h could behave as an independent electron donor to induce @xmath1-type conductivity in zno @xcite , along with subsequent support from various experiments involving muon spin rotation ( @xmath8sr ) @xcite , electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) , electron - nuclear double resonance ( endor ) measurements @xcite , and additional conventional techniques @xcite , have prompted the development of a generalized hypothesis of h as a shallow donor dopant in wide gap semiconductors @xcite .    as in the case of zno , @xmath8sr  studies have made a significant contribution to this subject by providing spectroscopic information on muonium ( mu ; an analog of a neutral h atom where the proton is replaced by a positive muon ) observed in a wide variety of semiconductors . while the dynamical aspects ( e.g. , diffusion ) of mu and h may differ considerably ,",
    "because of the relatively low mass of mu ( @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the proton mass ) , the local electronic structure of mu is virtually equivalent to that of h if a small correction to account for the difference in the reduced mass ( @xmath50.5% ) is made .",
    "the recent discovery of novel mu states having extremely small hyperfine parameters ( @xmath510@xmath11 times smaller than that of mu in vacuum ) and low ionization energy ( @xmath510@xmath12 mev ) in several compound semiconductors , including cds @xcite , znse @xcite , inn @xcite , and gan @xcite , also supports the hypothesis that mu ( and hence h ) can act as a donor in these compounds .    the generalized hypothesis also predicts shallow donor h in various metal oxides , most notably in rutile tio@xmath0 , where the origin of the unintentional @xmath1-type conductivity exhibited by the as - grown crystal is the focus of intense research .",
    "while the electrical and optical properties of tio@xmath0  are subject to both intrinsic and extrinsic defects , this material has a rich variety of potential applications in both electronic and opto - electronic devises , and detailed understanding of the h behavior is crucially important to the material functionality in this context .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , rutile has a tetragonal structure with ti@xmath13 ions occupying the body - center position , where each ti ion is coordinated by six ligand oxygen atoms ( o@xmath14 ) comprising a slightly distorted octahedron .",
    "the tio@xmath15 octahedra are linked by corner - sharing to form o chains parallel to the @xmath4 axis .",
    "regions of low electron density exist between the chains , forming the so - called  @xmath16 channel \" .",
    "earlier studies have shown that interstitial h resides in the @xmath16 channel , leading to the formation of an oh bond ( with a length of 0.109 nm ) perpendicular to the @xmath4 axis @xcite .",
    "the open channels cause anisotropy in the diffusion process , and may allow fast diffusion of smaller ions parallel to the tetragonal axis .",
    "it has recently been reported that the h diffusion can be strongly enhanced via irradiation of the crystal by infrared light that matches the oh bond stretch mode @xcite .",
    "crystal structure , showing a unit cell with @xmath17 nm and @xmath18 nm .",
    "( b ) atomic position of interstitial hydrogen ( h ) , where h forms oh bonds ( 0.109 nm ) at four inequivalent h sites .",
    "( c)(e ) signs of hyperfine parameters ( @xmath19 ) expected for the magnetic dipolar field ( @xmath20 ) generated by an electron spin localized on ti atom under an external field ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "( see text ) . ]    here , we report on the electronic structure of mu in single - crystalline rutile . although the existence of a mu state with an extremely small hyperfine ( hf ) parameter has been reported elsewhere @xcite , little is known about the local electronic structure . in this study , we show that the hf parameters exhibit strong anisotropy within the @xmath2 plane as well as along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the angular dependence of the hf parameters is perfectly in line with that expected for mu occupying the sites that are common to the interstitial h and forming omu bonds .",
    "more interestingly , the relative signs of these parameters indicate that the hf interaction is predominantly determined by the magnetic dipolar fields generated by the unpaired mu electron located away from the muon site .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with a recent report on the h - related paramagnetic center , in which the hf interaction is attributed to the ti@xmath22[oh]@xmath23 complex state with the @xmath24 electron being located on the ti ion nearest to the oh base @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a detailed comparison of the mu and h hf structures reveals a distinct difference between the complex centers , where a contribution from the residual spin polarization at the nearest neighboring o site ( antiparallel to that of the ti ion ) is suggested in the mu case . through consideration of the temperature ( @xmath25 ) dependence of the mu yield ,",
    "we also show that the unpaired electron bound to the mu complex state requires small energy for promotion to the conduction band . based on these observations",
    ", we argue that interstitial mu / h is one of the primary origins of unintentional @xmath1-type conductivity in rutile tio@xmath0 .",
    "this is despite its complex electronic structure , which differs significantly from that for the conventional effective - mass - like donor .",
    "a conventional @xmath8sr  experiment was conducted at the former booster meson facility in tsukuba ( at kek ) and at j - parc muse . a 4-mev muon beam that was almost 100% spin - polarized parallel to the beam direction",
    "was implanted into single - crystalline rutile wafers [ 30 mm @xmath26 30 mm , 1.0-mm thick , grown using the verneuil process ] , which were  as received \" from a local vendor ( furuuchi chemical co. ) . the definitions of the azimuthal and polar angles ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , respectively ) for the external magnetic field ( @xmath21 ) are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig1](a ) . for the @xmath27-dependence measurements ,",
    "a wafer having a normal axis orientation of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) was used , where the initial muon spin polarization ( @xmath31 ) was parallel to @xmath4 , and the @xmath32 axis was rotated contrary to the @xmath21 direction within the @xmath2 plane ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) . meanwhile , the @xmath28-dependence was measured by tilting the @xmath21 direction towards the @xmath4 axis ( except for @xmath34 , for which another @xmath35 crystal was used ) , where the angle was tuned by an additional field parallel to the @xmath4 axis . in both cases , the @xmath21-parallel component of the hf parameter was observed in terms of the frequency shift of the satellite signals .",
    "within the @xmath25 range of the present measurements ( 2 k @xmath36 290 k ) , a single diamagnetic state ( @xmath37 mu@xmath38 ) was observed above @xmath510 k as a signal precessing with a frequency @xmath39 ( comprising the central line ) , where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 mhz / t ) is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath42 .",
    "the depolarization rate for this signal was almost independent of @xmath25 with a gaussian damping ( @xmath50.02 @xmath8s@xmath43 ) ; this was unambiguously attributed to random local fields exerted by the nuclear magnetic moments of the @xmath44ti ( natural abundance : 7.4% ) and @xmath45ti ( 5.4% ) nuclei . meanwhile , the @xmath8sr  time spectra exhibited a remarkable change below @xmath510 k. a typical example ( observed at 5 k , @xmath46 mt ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , where a beat pattern due to multiple frequency components is clearly observed in the signal amplitude .",

    "[ fig2](b ) , one can trace two pairs of satellite lines in the fast fourier - transformed spectra ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , 2 ) , which are situated almost symmetrically around the central line ( @xmath51 mhz ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis showed that the least - square curve fits of the @xmath8sr  time spectra , assuming one pair of satellites , did not reproduce the data for those obtained with @xmath21 oriented away from the @xmath35 direction , yielding a poor @xmath52 .",
    "however , fits with two sets of satellites were found to yield a satisfactory result with significantly improved @xmath52 in the majority of cases .",
    "it was also found that the splitting ( @xmath53 ) of these satellites remained unchanged when the applied field was reduced to 10 mt , indicating that @xmath54 was in the high field - limit range , where the splitting was independent of the @xmath54 value .",
    "these observations clearly indicate that a significant fraction of implanted muons form a paramagnetic mu state characterized by an extremely small hf parameter ( almost 10@xmath11 times smaller than the vacuum value of @xmath55 mhz ) with significant anisotropy in the electronic structure .",
    "the results of curve fits for the time spectra assuming multiple precession frequency components ( @xmath49 ) are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for both ( a ) @xmath27 and ( b ) @xmath28 dependence .",
    "( we assumed that the signal amplitudes of @xmath56 and @xmath57 were common for each pair in the curve fits . ) as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , @xmath49 exhibits a strong anisotropy with a characteristic angle dependence that is symmetric over @xmath58 .",
    "considering the fact that there are four inequivalent h ( mu ) sites with different principal axis orientations for anisotropic hf parameters [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , four sets of satellite pairs discerned by different @xmath27-dependence can be expected .",
    "more specifically , it is predicted that the @xmath27 dependence of the hf parameters can be expressed in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 or @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the offset angle from the @xmath32 axis .",
    "it must be noted that the double sign correspondence between @xmath49 and the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ mufrq ] ) is not unique , because the sign of @xmath63 depends on that of @xmath19 and , thus , can change over the @xmath27 range . while our measurements are insensitive to the absolute sign of @xmath19 , they can determine the relative sign between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the solid curves shown in fig .  [ fig3](a ) are the result of a simultaneous fit for those curves using common values of @xmath19 and @xmath62 , where @xmath66 is inferred .",
    "this strongly suggests that the hf interaction is predominantly determined by the magnetic dipolar field generated by the off - site electron spin(s ) .",
    "( this scenario closely resembles the case of mu - substituted free radicals often observed in unsaturated organic compounds . ) moreover , considering that eqs .",
    "( [ mufrq ] ) and ( [ aperp ] ) predict eight lines when @xmath67 , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) indicates that @xmath68 is almost equal to @xmath69 within the frequency resolution , which is limited by the observation time range ( @xmath50.1 mhz ) .",

    "hereafter , we assume that @xmath70 ( see below ) .",
    "the @xmath28 dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , and is characterized by a narrow splitting of @xmath71 at @xmath34 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) ] , along with a monotonous increase with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "only one pair of satellites has been identified in this data set , most likely because of the narrow splitting relative to the frequency resolution .",
    "it is also notable that @xmath72 tends to be smaller than @xmath73 for some unknown reason .",
    "we tentatively attribute this to systematic uncertainty in the present measurement , and adopt @xmath74 in order to deduce the hf parameters using a form similar to eq .",
    "( [ aperp ] ) , such that @xmath75 where the sign of @xmath76 is left undetermined .",
    "the value of @xmath76 deduced from the curve fit is shown in table i , where @xmath77 has been determined to be 1.314(15 ) mhz ( which is in perfect agreement with the value deduced from the @xmath27 dependence ) .    ) and ( b ) polar angle ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "the @xmath19 s for the h - related center @xcite are scaled against the gyromagnetic ratio of @xmath80 ( indicated by an asterisk , see text ) .",
    "the @xmath19 signs for mu are assumed to be common to those for h. [ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we currently speculate that the difference in the electronic structure between mu and h is primarily due to the local environment of the specimen . while the present mu complex state was observed in an  as received \" crystal , the h - related paramagnetic state was observed after a reduction process ( annealing at 600@xmath81 c for 10 min in a n@xmath0 atmosphere @xcite ) .",
    "considering the fact that the reduction process also yields o vacancies , it may be of interest to recall the recent investigation based on density - functional theory that suggested that h is more stable at the o vacancy site , where it adopts a negatively charged state to form a ti@xmath22h@xmath82 complex state @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider the possibility that the paramagnetic state observed via epr / endor might correspond to such a state , although the consistency with experimental results must be carefully examined .",
    "the fact that the relative magnitudes of the @xmath19 s for the h - related center correspond to the case of @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ dipo ] ) ( i.e. , @xmath64:@xmath65:@xmath76 = @xmath84:@xmath85:@xmath84 ) seems to constitute supporting evidence , as it suggests that the relevant h atom has no neighboring o atom .    the fact that the hyperfine interaction is dominated by a magnetic dipolar interaction also places a strong constraint on the diffusion of @xmath80 in the @xmath16 channel , because the @xmath19 are strongly dependent on the distance to the electron ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the diffusive motion of @xmath80 against a stationary @xmath24 electron at the ti site would immediately lead to the strong damping of satellite signals due to the fluctuation of @xmath87 and hence of @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence of the fractional yield ( @xmath88 ) for the mu complex state is shown in fig .",
    "the sum of the signal amplitude between the mu complex state and the diamagnetic state ( not shown ) is almost independent of @xmath25 , suggesting that the mu complex is converted to a diamagnetic state above @xmath510 k. here , it must be noted that @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) does not necessarily indicate two different muon sites with different charge states . in non - metallic compounds , it is usually expected that the initial yield of the paramagnetic state upon muon implantation is predominantly determined by the density of the short - lived free electrons that are produced via radiolysis near the end of the muon radiation track .",
    "while this density varies between compounds , it is independent of @xmath25 because the radiolysis is an athermal process .",
    "we assume that the muon site in tio@xmath0  is unique ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) over the entire observed @xmath25 range , where the initial yield of the mu complex is controlled by the athermal electron density , which is independent of @xmath25 .    in general , the diamagnetic state can be either positively or negatively charged .",
    "if the electronic energy levels ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) associated with the mu complex are situated near the top of the valence band , a mu@xmath23 state can be expected at lower @xmath25 because the fermi level ( @xmath93 ) is likely to be situated far above the mid - gap in the present @xmath1-type specimen ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) . in that case ,",
    "an _ increase _ in the yield of the mu complex would be observed with elevating temperature due to the hole capture process ( @xmath95 ) ; however , this is contrary to the actual observed behavior .",
    "thus , the behavior of the mu complex strongly suggests that the process relevant to the promotion of the diamagnetic state is electron release , @xmath96 ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) , and that the mu complex state can serve as an electron donor .",
    "provided that the ionization of the mu complex state is driven by an arrhenius - type activation process , the disappearance of the mu signal above @xmath510 k suggests that the activation energy ( @xmath98 ) is of the order of @xmath6 mev .",
    "this is in line with certain earlier reports suggesting unidentified shallow level states ( e.g , via optical absorption @xcite or infrared absorption spectroscopy on deuterated rutile@xcite ) . in any case",
    ", it must be remembered that the interpretation of @xmath98 depends on the detailed neutral charge state formation process of the mu complex , and also on the kind of equilibrium state realized for the mu complex formation . at one end of the range",
    ", @xmath98 represents a direct transition from the defect level to the bottom of the conduction band , while at the other extreme , in equilibrium , it indicates a transition from the defect level to the fermi level ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) .",
    "since the origin of the @xmath1-type conductivity in the present specimen is unknown , the present value of @xmath98 should be interpreted as a lower bound for the actual defect level .",
    "we have demonstrated that the electronic structure of the interstitial mu center in rutile is characterized by extremely small and highly anisotropic hyperfine parameters .",
    "these parameters are predominantly determined by magnetic dipolar interaction with the unpaired mu electron , which is primarily situated at the ti site .",
    "the hyperfine parameters are quantitatively explained by a model that considers a small residual spin polarization of the o atom ( which is antiparallel to that of the ti atom ) , suggesting that the electronic structure should be interpreted as being a ti - o - mu complex state .",
    "the extremely small effective moment size of the unpaired electron ( @xmath50.05@xmath100 at the ti site , @xmath50.0039@xmath100 at the o site ) as well as the small activation energy required for its promotion to the conduction band , implies that the mu complex ( and hence the corresponding h state ) can serve as an electron donor .",
    "this strongly suggests that h is one of the primary origins of unintentional @xmath1-type conductivity in rutile tio@xmath0 .",
