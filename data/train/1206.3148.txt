    "potassium currents across nerve membranes have been widely studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "ionic channels selecting potassium currents are present in almost all types of cells in all organisms and they play many important and different functional roles .",
    "different types of measurements @xcite provide a very detailed description of the behavior of potassium channels . in general , less",
    "is known on their structure  @xcite .",
    "kcsa , a potassium channel from _ streptomyces lividans _ , is the first ion channel whose structure has been identified via x  ray crystallography @xcite .",
    "all ionic channels form selective pores in the cell membrane which open and close and , when in the open state , allow permeation of a selected ionic species ( potassium in k@xmath0channels ) . their ability to open and close , i.e. , _ gating _ , and their ability to allow the flux of a particular ionic species , i.e. , _ selectivity _ , are not yet completely understood .",
    "a lot is known in the case of the kcsa channel and , with some care , can be extrapolated to the whole family of k@xmath0 channels .    in kcsa , see for instance the detailed description in @xcite , gating is realized via four crossing transmembrane helices on the intracellular side .",
    "when in the open state , a spherical water ",
    "filled cavity of diameter about 10     widens on the intracellular side of the channel up to the membrane plane .",
    "there a 1015     long and 3     large channel containing the selectivity filter connects the cavity to the extracellular side .",
    "when the channel flips to the open state a solution with the cytoplasm concentration reaches the entrance of the channel .",
    "part of the ions permeates through the channel leaving an ion depleted region close to the pore .",
    "the typical time needed to restore the intracellular concentrations close to the pore will depend strongly on the diffusion process of ions inside the cell .",
    "we can then imagine that the current flowing through the channel will depend both on the diffusion of ions in the cytoplasm and on the behavior of the selectivity filter .",
    "the problem of computing the permeation current in the open state , namely , the so called _ true current _ , has been approached theoretically by a large variety of methods .",
    "molecular dynamics studies @xcite give a very detailed description , but they usually do not provide macroscopic currents estimates due to the too small involved time scale .",
    "kinetic models @xcite give very useful information , since electro  physiological experiments are performed over time scales much longer than the atomic one , with the drawback of the extreme simplification on the structure of the channel .",
    "in the recent literature it has been examined the possibility to validate these kinetic models by comparing the predicted behaviors with those observed experimentally .",
    "in particular the models have been tested against their ability to predict the current  voltage behavior . in this respect",
    "very accurate experimental results have been published for different potassium channels , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the kcsa , maxik , and the shaker channels , respectively .",
    "models such as those quoted above describe to some extent the dynamics of ion permeation through the selectivity filter , the concentration of the ion in the cell is introduced in the model as a constant parameter . in other words in those studies the diffusion of the ions inside the cell is not taken into account .",
    "our opinion is that diffusion , as explained above , must take an important part in the permeation phenomenon . in @xcite ,",
    "inspired by @xcite , we introduced a model where the channel is lumped to a two state stochastic point system and the interaction between the dynamics of the ions inside the cell ( diffusion ) and that of the selectivity filter itself is taken into account .",
    "the channel is then thought of as part of the cell more than as an isolated structure . in that paper",
    "both an analytical and monte carlo study showed the possibility to achieve gating via selection .    in this paper",
    "we examine the possibility to predict the behavior of the current  voltage curves ( graph of the permeation current vs.  the external potential difference applied to the membrane ) on the basis of a similar model .",
    "a modification is needed to take into account the effect of an external voltage difference through the cell membrane .",
    "the model is thus defined to mimic the three effects that seem to be the most relevant in the process : ( i ) diffusion of the ions inside the cell ; ( ii ) dynamics of the selectivity filter ; ( iii ) dynamics of the ions inside the selectivity filter .",
    "we compare the current  voltage behavior predicted by our model with experimental results from @xcite and find a very good agreement both for the dependence of the current on the ion concentration and on the external voltage .",
    "ion diffusion ( item ( i ) ) inside the cell is modeled as a symmetric random walk on a finite line .",
    "we use a one dimensional system in order to compute all the interesting quantities explicitly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) . as we shall comment later the dimensionality of the system",
    "affects only our estimate of the diffusion coefficients of ions inside the cytoplasm .",
    "corrections will be introduced to compute the three  dimensional value of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we remark that point ( i ) is the real distinguishing feature of our model .",
    "as we shall discuss later , the introduction of ion diffusion in the intracellular region and hence of the depletion phenomenon , will allow a full description of the permeation current behavior with respect to both external voltage and ion intracellular concentration .",
    "one of the two boundary points of the finite line where ions diffuse is reflecting , whereas the other mimics the selectivity filter .",
    "the dynamics of the pore ( item ( ii ) ) is assumed to be stochastic . the pore jumps randomly between two states , the _ low _ and the _ high  affinity _ one .",
    "the dynamics of the pore is independent from that of the ions inside the cell .",
    "the chances that an ion has to enter the pore depend both on the ion species and on the pore state ; in this way selection is implemented in the model .",
    "this description is quite faithful to the real behavior of the selectivity filter .",
    "indeed , two possible states are possible for the filter @xcite , the low and the high  affinity one . when the filter is in the low ",
    "affinity state permeation is favored , but no ionic species is preferred .",
    "thus , in order to realize selectivity in an efficient way , the filter has to jump between these two states . to our knowledge",
    "the time fraction spent by the filter in the low affinity ",
    "state is not known experimentally ; the value predicted by analyzing the current  voltage curves via our model depends on the ionic concentration in cytosol and is of order @xmath1 .",
    "this result seems to be coherent with the qualitative description given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  5 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the ions inside the filter ( item ( iii ) ) is not modeled in detail , we just assume that a particle inside the pore can either exit the system or reenter the cell with a fixed probability .",
    "this ejection probability is chosen as a function of the voltage difference across the cell membrane .",
    "our modeling of the dynamics inside the filter is , thus , reduced to the choice of this function .",
    "it is worth noting that the model is able to reproduce accurately the experimental results with different choices of this function , that is to say with different descriptions of the dynamics of the ions inside the filter .",
    "more precisely we shall see that it is possible to explain the experimental results via different models for the dynamics of the ions inside the filter ; when a different functional behavior for the ejection probability in terms of the external voltage is chosen , a different value of the typical time spent by the filter in the low  affinity state is found . in other words",
    "different models of the dynamics of the ions inside the filter are allowed provided the low ",
    "affinity state probability is changed suitably .",
    "indeed , we shall find very good results either by choosing the ejection probability function according to very well known and studied theories @xcite or by assuming that the ejection probability for a potassium ion trapped inside the filter is a power law function of the applied ( suitably renormalized ) voltage difference . in both cases",
    "our model will predict curves fitting cleanly the experimental result for the  true \" ion current with reasonable values of the intracellular diffusion coefficient ; but different values of the low ",
    "affinity state probability will be predicted .",
    "a more precise knowledge of this probability would enable us to discriminate among different mechanisms .",
    "moreover , we remark that our model will be also able to explain the behavior of ionic species different from potassium by choosing properly the physical parameters appearing in the ejection probability function of the external voltage difference .",
    "we finally note that some care has to be used when the theoretical results are compared with experiments . in the biological literature , see for instance @xcite , two different types of current are reported , the _ apparent _ and the _ true _ one .",
    "this is connected with the peculiar behavior of ionic channels : two different states are observed , _ closed _ and _ open _ channel . in the first state",
    "a zero current is observed , in the second one the outgoing current fluctuates randomly on a very short time ",
    "scale and a not zero average current , called _ true current _ , is measured .",
    "the true current can be accessed experimentally only if the time resolution of the instruments is good enough to distinguish neatly between the open and the closed time intervals . when this is not the case a different current , called _ apparent current _ , is measured .",
    "this current is smaller than the true one since the instruments average the current also on time intervals in which the channel is closed .",
    "the model we propose here is intended to mimic the behavior of the ionic channel in the open state .",
    "the average outgoing flux that will be computed has then to be thought as a prediction for the true current . in section  [ s : modello ]",
    "we introduce the lattice model . section  [ s : sperimentali ] is devoted to the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "our results will be discussed in section  [ s : discussione ] , where , in particular , we shall comment on the physical meaning of the fitting parameters introduced previously .",
    "our conclusions are briefly summarized in section  [ s : conclusioni ] .",
    "the intracellular region is modeled via a finite one  dimensional lattice @xmath2 with @xmath3 sites .",
    "two sites of @xmath4 are said to be _ nearest  neighbors _ if and only if their mutual euclidean distance is equal to one .",
    "the boundary @xmath5 of @xmath6 is the collection of the two sites of @xmath4 not belonging to @xmath6 and neighboring one of the site of @xmath6 .",
    "one of the two points of the boundary of @xmath6 is called _ pore _ , and denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "one ionic species performs an independent symmetric random walk on the lattice with reflectivity conditions on the site of @xmath5 different from the pore .",
    "the particles on the site neighboring the pore behave in a special way that will be described below ; due to the peculiarity of such a rule the walkers will turn out to be not independent .",
    "the number of walkers is denoted by @xmath8 .    the fact that the walkers are independent on @xmath6 means that the position of a particle does not affect the motion of the others , in particular no constraint to the number of particles on each site is prescribed .",
    "the fact that the random walks are symmetric means that each jump between two neighboring sites of @xmath6 is performed with probability @xmath9 . since we assumed",
    "that the boundary is reflecting , particles in the site neighboring @xmath10 can stay in the same site with probability @xmath9 .",
    "two states are allowed for the pore : _ high  affinity _ and _ low  affinity_. the pore switches between the two states randomly ; the probability that the pore is in the low  affinity state is denoted by @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "moreover the pore can be either _ free _ or _ occupied _ by an ion .",
    "the behavior of the particles on the site @xmath12 neighboring the pore depends on the state of the pore itself as it is precisely stated in figure  [ f : reticolo ] .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "if the pore is occupied by a particle , no other ion can enter it . if the pore is ( free ) in the low  affinity state , particles can enter it ; when they enter the pore they immediately dissociate so that , with probability @xmath13 $ ] they exit the system while they reenter @xmath6 with probability @xmath14 . if the pore is free and in the high  affinity state , one particle can enter it , but , once entered , it remains there until the pore state changes to the low  affinity one .",
    "when this happens the ion dissociates with the same rule described above . as noted above , due to the pore rule",
    ", the walkers are not independent .    whenever an ion exits the system another particle is put at random with uniform probability @xmath15 on one of the @xmath3 sites in @xmath6 so that the number of ions is kept constant .",
    "the model described above is implemented with the markov chain described in detail in the appendix  [ s : bold ] .",
    "iteration _ or _",
    "sweep _ of the chain is the collection of the steps that are performed at each time @xmath16 .",
    "as we have explained in the introduction , the aim of this paper is that of computing the outgoing ionic current .",
    "this quantity is related to the number of particles that exit the system .",
    "we let @xmath17 be the number of particles which exited the system in the time interval @xmath18 $ ] . moreover ,",
    "we let the _ flux _ at time @xmath16 be @xmath19 . since we defined the stochastic process in such a way that the number of ions keeps constant in the volume @xmath6",
    ", @xmath19 approaches a constant value @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity , that we shall call the _ outgoing flux _",
    ", is expected to be proportional to the  real \" current measured experimentally .",
    "the existence of this limiting flux can be deduced by remarking that the chain is irreducible and that the space state is finite .",
    "so we have that there exists a stationary measure for the process and that , in the limit @xmath21 , the time dependent quantities tend to the corresponding quantities averaged against the stationary measure .    by exploiting one  dimensionality ,",
    "the model can be solved analytically and the outgoing flux can be computed explicitly . in our model",
    "the pore is modeled in a very simple fashion , indeed it is just a two state bernoulli process ; the main difficulty is , obviously , the interaction between the random walk inside the volume @xmath6 and the pore itself .",
    "we consider the stationary state reached by a walker and denote by @xmath22 the probability for the ion to occupy the site @xmath12 of @xmath6 neighboring the pore .",
    "particles that enter the pore in the low  affinity state can exit the system with probability @xmath23 . with the same probability a particle trapped in the pore in the high  affinity state can exit @xmath6 when the pore switches to the low  affinity state .",
    "we can write the outgoing flux as @xmath24 where we have denoted by @xmath25 the probability that in the stationary state the pore is occupied by a particle when it switches from the high to the low  affinity state .",
    "this one dimensional model can be solved following the same idea used in @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath26 and @xmath27 where we have set @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "in @xcite it has been demonstrated that the kcsa , a bacterial ion channel of @xmath30 topology and very well known structure ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) , is a potassium channel . in that paper",
    "very precise measurements of potassium ( and some other ion species ) currents are reported . in this section",
    "we try to explain their results via our model .",
    "since the structure of the kcsa channel is well know , in this section will be mainly concerned with the experimental measures in @xcite . at the end a brief analysis of the results in @xcite and @xcite , concerning respectively the maxik and the shaker channel , will be given .",
    "note that the shaker is a voltage  activated channel of @xmath31 topology .      in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  2b ) the potassium current  voltage curves at different concentrations @xmath32  mm are shown .",
    "we text the reliability of our lattice model by exhibiting neat fitting of those experimental data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the above section we have seen that the model proposed in this paper is able to explain in great detail the experimental data for the current  voltage curves in the kcsa ionic channel .",
    "we have shown that the theoretical predictions fit nicely the measured curves provided the parameters defining the model are suitably chosen .",
    "it is notable that our model explains the dependence of the permeation current both on the external voltage ( figures  [ f : fit - k - a ] , [ f : fit - sh ] , and [ f : fit - oth - a ] ) and on the ion concentration in the intracellular region ( figure  [ f : fit - cond - a ] ) .    in @xcite the same experimental data @xcite have been analyzed via a kinetic model formerly introduced by the same author . in that model",
    "the selectivity filter is treated as an isolated structure and the intracellular ion concentration is an input constant of the model .",
    "two different regimes for the filter had to be assumed corresponding , respectively , to high ( 400  mm and 800  mm ) and low ( 20  mm , 50  mm , and 100  mm ) potassium concentrations .",
    "two different sets of the parameters carachterizing the filter behavior ( the analogue of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) were found . in other words the model in @xcite",
    "predicts that the behavior of the selectivity filter depends on the intracellular ion concentration . in our model",
    "the selectivity filter is coupled with the diffusion of ions in the intracellular region ; this is indeed the key novelty and the distinguishing feature of our approach .",
    "this allows to explain the experimental data referring to all the concentrations with the same set of parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for the filter behavior .    to compare the way in which data are explained by the model in @xcite and by our model",
    ", we first note that the electrical dissociation distance @xmath34 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  1 ) ) that we find is very close to that fitted there .",
    "moreover , we note that in @xcite in the lower intracellular concentration regime , the fitted parameters are such that an higher effective concentration ( @xmath35 in their notation ) is seen . in our model particle diffusion accounts for this effect .",
    "we now discuss the reasonableness of the values we found for these fitting parameters for the potassium current data for the kcsa ionic channel ( see section  [ s : potassio ] ) .    as a first step",
    "we have to give a continuum interpretation of the lattice modeling the cytosol .",
    "in other words we have to associate with the unit length of the lattice model a physically reasonable quantity .",
    "we imagine to associate with each lattice site a small cubic volume whose side length is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "recall that the experimental concentration @xmath37 is expressed in millimolar , that is as number of moles per cubic meter ( i.e. , number of millimoles per liter ) .",
    "recall , also , that @xmath8 is the number of particles in the lattice model and that @xmath3 is the number of sites in @xmath6 .",
    "we then have the following identification @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the avogadro number and @xmath36 has to be expressed in meter .    since in our fitting procedure",
    "we have chosen @xmath8 such that @xmath40  mm , we have that @xmath41 where we have used that @xmath3 has been fitted to @xmath42 , see the caption of table  [ t : nuova ] .",
    "the above argument provides us with a way to associate a length unit measure with our lattice model .",
    "the result we found for @xmath36 is physically reasonable , indeed we can assume that each cubic volume associated with a site of the lattice can accommodate few ( say one or two ) ions , so that its side length has to be of the order of magnitude of the ionic diameter .",
    "this value we found for @xmath36 is then reasonable , since potassium ion , atomic , and van der waals radius are respectively given by @xmath43 , and @xmath44  nm .    as a second step",
    "we have to give a continuum interpretation of the discrete unit of time of the markov chain .",
    "in other words we have to associate with the unit of time a physically reasonable quantity @xmath45 .",
    "we consider the evolution of our model up to the time @xmath16 and note that the true current measured in the experiments can be identified as @xmath46 where @xmath47  pc is the charge of a potassium ion and @xmath20 is the theoretical model outgoing flux .",
    "we then identify @xmath48 with the parameter @xmath49 introduced in equation ( [ iva ] ) ; that is to say we write @xmath50 and we can use the estimated @xmath49 listed in the first row of table  [ t : nuova ] to compute the values of @xmath45 listed in the same table .",
    "we have no direct clue to establish if these values for @xmath45 are reasonable or not . but starting from this values we can estimate the diffusion coefficient of potassium ions in the cytosol . indeed , see appendix  [ s : diff ] , the intracellular ion diffusion coefficient is related to the other parameters by the equation ( [ ident ] ) , which yields @xmath51 by using this equation we compute the diffusion coefficient for the potassium .",
    "results have been reported in the last row of table  [ t : nuova ] .",
    "the order of magnitude we found for the diffusion coefficient of potassium ions is @xmath52  @xmath53sec .",
    "this result is several ( say three ) order of magnitude larger than the real ( experimental ) value @xcite .",
    "this problem was indeed quite expected , since we modeled the diffusion of ions in cytosol with a one  dimensional lattice .",
    "as we have already remarked , the one  dimensional choice is motivated by the possibility to write explicitly the solution of the probabilistic model .",
    "explicit formulas are quite necessary to perform the extended analysis discussed in section  [ s : sperimentali ] . as a future work we are now planning a monte carlo assisted analysis for the three  dimensional version of our model .    in any case",
    "we prove , now , that the estimates we found in this one  dimensional case for the diffusion coefficient are quite reasonable .",
    "consider a simple symmetric random walk with unitary time on a three - dimensional cubic lattice with @xmath3 sites and spacing @xmath54 .",
    "we consider the side length @xmath55 in order to ensure that the  real \" volume associated with the three dimensional model is equal to that associated with the one dimensional one . by a classical argument similar to the one developed in the appendix  [ s : diff ]",
    "it is proven that the _ squared mean distance _ walked up to time @xmath56 is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this implies that the typical time needed by the walker , started at random in the lattice , to reach a particular point of the boundary ( say the pore ) is of order @xmath59 indeed , the first term is the square of the average distance of a point inside a cube of side length @xmath60 from the boundary of the cube itself and the third one is the number of times the walker has to visit the boundary before touching the pore ( number of points on the lateral surface of the cube ) .",
    "note that the product between the first and the second term is an estimate for the time needed to touch the boundary of the cube for a walker started at random in the cube itself .    in our former analysis , in computing fluxes",
    ", we indeed evaluated this time in the framework of our one  dimensional model . by repeating the same argument we can say that this time was estimated as @xmath61 by equating the two expressions found above we find @xmath62 where we used @xmath63 ( see the caption of table  [ t : nuova ] ) . by the equation",
    "above it follows that to the diffusion constant estimated via the one  dimensional model ranging in @xmath64 ",
    "@xmath65  @xmath66/sec ( see table  [ t : nuova ] ) it corresponds a  true \" diffusion coefficient ranging in @xmath67  @xmath68  @xmath66/sec , which is very close to the experimental value for the potassium diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of intracellular ion diffusion on ionic currents permeating through the cell membrane ionic channels .",
    "ion channels share the following common properties : the ion flux is rapid , the channel is selective , and its functions are regulated by a gating mechanism . although a formidable effort , with absolutely remarkable results , has been performed recently , a complete understanding of ionic channel behavior is still lacking .    thanks to the patch clamp technique very precise measurements of the true current across a single channels are available . in this paper",
    "we have proposed a model which is able to provide a full explanation of the ksca current  voltage experimental curves @xcite by taking into account the following three effects : ion diffusion in the intracellular region , dynamics of the filter , and dynamics of the ions inside the filter .",
    "in particular our model points out the role played by intracellular diffusion on ion permeation in compensating the ion depletion in the region close to the pore .",
    "the model is able to explain the dependence of the experimetal data referring to the true ionic currents both on the external voltage and on the intracellular potassium concentration .",
    "is is also notable that all the fitting parameters have a clear qualitative and quantitative physical interpretation .",
    "moreover , we noted that the estimate we got for the typical time spent by the filter in the low ",
    "affinity state is strictly related to the dynamics of ions inside the filter .",
    "this suggests that our approach , corroborated by new experimental data , should be able to shed some light also on the dynamics of the ions inside the filter .",

    "_ variable @xmath16 .",
