    "the concept of the density of states ( dos ) is used in many areas of physics .",
    "for example , it is important for reaction rates in nuclear physics , the calculation of specific heat capacities , black - body radiation , phonon spectra , and so on .",
    "@xcite the dos arises naturally and early in statistical physics . to calculate average quantities in statistical physics , one could do an integral over phase space , but this is typically very complex .",
    "the alternative is to express the variable of interest in terms of the energy of the system .",
    "the volume element in phase space is replaced by a weighting factor in an energy integral , which is often much easier to work with .",
    "this weighting factor is the density of states and is the subject of this paper .",
    "consider the problem of calculating @xmath1 , the expected outcome of a measurement of some physical quantity @xmath2 .",
    "if you know the allowed quantum states of the system and can calculate @xmath3 , the value of @xmath2 in the @xmath4th state , then @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the probability of the system being in the @xmath4th state .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as a sum over microstates .",
    "it is often easier to write @xmath2 as a function of energy and perform a sum over the allowed energies .",
    "we then have @xmath7 , where the probability of the system being on the energy level @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the partition function , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the degeneracy of the level or number of states with energy @xmath8 .",
    "if the system has an energy @xmath8 , then each of these @xmath12 states is equally likely .",
    "now , for our expected value of @xmath2 we have @xmath13    in a system where @xmath8 is continuous ( or effectively so ) , the sum becomes an integral and @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath14the dos  a measure of how many states there are in a small range @xmath15 around @xmath8 .",
    "the dos @xmath14 is no longer an absolute number of states ; it is now a weighting factor in an integral over energy .",
    "we must be careful here because @xmath14 is often confused with the level density ; indeed , the terms are often used interchangeably .",
    "we use the term  level \" to mean an allowed value of energy and the dos is the level density multiplied by a degeneracy factor",
    ".    in this paper we present a procedural approach to obtain the dos for systems that arise in modern physics and statistical mechanics courses . in the next section",
    "we apply the procedure to a single particle in a rigid box . in sec .",
    "[ sec : procedure ] the procedure for visualizing the dos is summarized and the effect of the shape of the box on the dos is examined .",
    "section  [ sec : npart ] addresses systems of @xmath0 noninteracting bosons , where @xmath0-particle spectra are calculated and the dependance of their dos on @xmath0 is compared with a simple model .",
    "the particle in a box is one of the first examples students encounter in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is simple enough to solve from scratch by hand and exhibits much of the salient nonclassical behavior .",
    "furthermore , it serves as a basic template for a host of interesting topics : scattering , double - well potentials , and perturbation theory to name a few .",
    "we will discuss the dos in the context of a particle in a box of various dimensions .",
    "first we introduce the concept of degeneracy via numerical results for the spectrum .",
    "this leads naturally to the idea of a cumulative state number from which the dos naturally follows .",
    "then an analytic approach to obtaining the dos is presented .",
    "we start with a ( nonrelativistic ) particle of mass @xmath16 inside a box .",
    "we assume the box is rigid , by which we mean that the potential energy is infinite outside the box and zero inside the box . in a one - dimensional box of length @xmath17 the energy levels are given by @xcite @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and the quantum number @xmath20 is an integer . in a two - dimensional square box with sides of length @xmath17 ,",
    "the energy levels are given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the quantum numbers corresponding to the two spatial dimensions .",
    "in the three - dimensional case of a cubical box of side length @xmath17 , we have @xmath24 .",
    "it is natural to associate each quantum number with a number line and each integer value with a point along this line . in two dimensions",
    "the pair of quantum numbers defines a plane or two - dimensional space called @xmath20-space.@xcite this space could also be called momentum space by using the identity @xmath25 .",
    "the energy depends on the sum of the squares of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "one way of thinking about the distribution of these energies is to locate them in @xmath20-space . using the horizontal axis for @xmath22 and the vertical axis for @xmath23 , we can write all energy values at their corresponding grid points .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dcircle ] , where at each pair of quantum numbers @xmath26 the energy is written ( in units of @xmath27 ) ; for example , at grid points @xmath28 and @xmath29 we see a  10 . \"",

    "[ fig:2dcircle ] the circles corresponding to energies `` 36 '' and  65 \" are shown as dotted curves with radii @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .    when energies correspond to more than one independent state we say they are `` degenerate . ''",
    "if we make a list of all energies corresponding to the various quantum numbers @xmath26 and order them by energy , we can make a plot of the `` number of states with energy @xmath8 '' vs @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity is @xmath12 , the degeneracy of the energy @xmath8 , and for discrete spectra it is an integer .",
    "a plot of @xmath12 is a series of spikes , of height @xmath12 , at each allowed @xmath8 .    to further illustrate this idea , imagine a hypothetical single - particle spectrum where the lowest nine energies are @xmath36 .",

    "[ fig : degeneracy ] ) . in other words ,",
    "given an ordered list of energies @xmath39 we have @xmath40 .    a plot of the spikes @xmath12 gives a visual measure of the degeneracies of the energies .",
    "these degeneracies are quite delicate in the sense that most perturbations to the potential will break them and the picture for @xmath12 will change dramatically .",
    "each @xmath12-high spike will turn into a cluster of @xmath12 separate spikes , each one unit high .",
    "the spacing of the spikes will be determined by the strength of the perturbation .",
    "the corresponding change in @xmath37 is that each step in the unperturbed system that was @xmath12 high will now become a series of short steps , each one unit high ( upper and lower right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] ) .",
    "it is hoped that figs .",
    "[ fig:2dcircle ] and  [ fig : degeneracy ] will be a useful starting point for student discussion .",
    "a smooth dos function @xmath14 is useful because at higher energies one is interested in the number of states in an interval , or the density of spikes along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the dos and cumulative state number are related by @xmath41 , so the dos is recognized as the slope of @xmath37 .",
    "we must be careful here because the slope of a staircase is infinite at each step , so we mean slope in an averaging sense .    to get @xmath14 from @xmath42",
    "we can take a numerical derivative using a finite difference scheme , @xmath43 it is worth saying explicitly that if the energies are put into bins of width @xmath44 , with center @xmath8 , then @xmath14=(number of states in bin)/(width of bin ) .",
    "now that we have a numerical representation for @xmath14 , we would like to get an analytic expression for @xmath14 that is valid for the statistical region where the dos is large and well approximated by a smooth function .",
    "we will do this for the rigid box potentials where @xmath45 ( in units of @xmath27 ) . in @xmath20-space the states with energy in an interval @xmath15 centered on @xmath8 correspond to a set of points in a spherical shell of thickness @xmath46 with all - positive coordinates . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dcircle ] the number of states between the quarter circles of radius @xmath20 and @xmath47 is proportional to the area of the curved band .",
