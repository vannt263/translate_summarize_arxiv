    "quite surprisingly , it was found in the mid - eighties that dynamic phenomena on fractal structures often were controlled not by one or two relevant length scales , but rather an infinite hierarchy of such length scales @xcite .",
    "one of the prime examples of this phenomenon is the current distribution in the random resistor network at the percolation threshold @xcite . in spite of the large effort which was invested to understand how such an infinite hierarchy could appear , _",
    "e.g. _ through studying hierarchical structures yielding to analytic calculations @xcite , no satisfactory general explanation was found .",
    "the large numerical effort that was invested at that time on the random resistor network focussed on two dimensions .",
    "the reason for this was that three - dimensional networks were essentially out of reach of the computational power available at the time .",
    "the aim of the present work is to establish that , as in two dimensions , the current distribution in three dimensions is multifractal and to determine the corresponding scaling exponents with high presicion .",
    "in addition to their theoretical interest , these results are of importance in making contact with experimental studies on three - dimensional conductor - insulator mixtures @xcite , and microemulsions @xcite . to achieve this goal , we made use of the latest developments in iterative solvers and massively parallel computers .",
    "in section [ sec2 ] we present the model and the method of solution . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the current distribution through the behaviour of the moments and their exponents , in addition to examining the statistical fluctuations of the moments .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional cubic lattice of size @xmath5 with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions . for the @xmath8 direction the boundary conditions are as follows : at @xmath9 and @xmath10 we place two plates with a constant potential difference set at a value of 1 .",
    "therefore , the length of the lattice in the @xmath8 direction is @xmath11 , while in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions the length is @xmath12 .",
    "this geometry was chosen because the data layout becomes optimal on the connection machine cm5 which we used for our computations .",
    "all bonds are visited and , with a probability @xmath13 , a resistor is placed .",
    "all resistors have the same resistance , 1 .",
    "we set @xmath13 equal to the bond percolation threshold for the cubic lattice , @xmath14 , as determined by stauffer _",
    "after all the bonds have been visited , a ( parallel ) cluster finding algorithm is applied to determine if there is a spanning cluster that connects the two plates .",
    "if no such cluster exists , the procedure is repeated until one is obtained .",
    "this cluster finding algorithm is very fast but only determines if there is such a cluster , not its exact geometry .",
    "the equations to be solved are the usual current equations ( kirchhoff s equations ) on the lattice which can be easily solved using the conjugate gradient or related iterative algorithms @xcite .",
    "we wrote the program in cm fortran and used the iterative solvers in the connection machine scientific software library ( cmssl ) which contains thirteen of them . which one to use , depends on the particular matrices one is dealing with .",
    "for this problem we found that the quasi - minimized cgs ( qcgs ) @xcite algorithm performs very well .",
    "our stopping condition is for the residual to be less than @xmath15 , which for the biggest lattices gave a true accuracy of about @xmath16 .",
    "we estimated this by calculating the conductivity of each realization in two ways : 1 ) calculate the total current crossing an @xmath17 plane at @xmath18 , which , knowing the potential difference ( = 1 ) , gives the conductivity , and 2 ) calculate the second moment of the currents .",
    "this is again equal the conductivity as the externally applied potential difference is 1 . on the biggest lattices , for which the accuracy at which we can determine the currents is the lowest",
    ", they agreed to within @xmath19 . as it is too time consuming compared to solving the kirchhoff equations , we made no effort to identify the bonds that did not belong to the spanning cluster .",
    "we simply solved for the currents keeping the disconnected bonds and dangling ends in the system .",
    "this made it impossible to get an accurate count of the number of current - carrying bonds .",
    "we will , therefore , give results for the second , fourth , and sixth momemts of the currents , leaving out the zeroth moment .",
    "the number of realizations for @xmath20 , 16 , 32 , 48 , 64 , and 80 were 12000 , 9198 , 2765 , 1120 , 1913 , and 953 respectively .",
    "solving for the currents in the bonds allows us to calculate the @xmath21th moment of the current distribution , given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the realization , @xmath24 is the number of these realizations , and @xmath25 is the current in the @xmath26th bond in realization @xmath23 .",
    "these moments are calculated in the constant voltage ensemble where the potential difference is kept constant realization to realization .",
    "we expect the moments of the currents to scale as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the length of the system in the @xmath8 direction , and @xmath29 is the exponent of the @xmath21th moment .",
    "figures [ fig1]a , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show , on a log - log scale , the second , fourth and sixth moments respectively .",
    "the second moment measures the total dissipated power , and since the externally applied voltage difference is 1 , it directly gives the conductance of the network .",
    "so , figure [ fig1]a gives the scaling of the conductance as a function of @xmath30 , giving the exponent @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig1]b shows the scaling of the _ variance _ of the conductance distribution as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "we see that it scales with the same exponent as the conductance itself .",
    "the same is true for the other moments .",
    "thus , the relative fluctuations neither grow nor decrease with lattice size . the scaling of the _ conductivity _ with @xmath30 is obtained by simply dividing the results for the second moment by @xmath30 ( since this is the conductance ) giving @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the conductivity exponent and @xmath4 is the corrrelation function exponent .",
    "our value for @xmath32 is in agreement with , but more precise than , the value determined by gingold and lobb @xcite who obtained @xmath33 . with @xmath34",
    ", we therefore have that @xmath35 .",
    "the experimental values reported for this exponent ranges from 1.2 to 2.1 for the measurements based on microemulsions @xcite , and for the measurements based on conductor - insulator mixtures , the values @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite , and @xmath38 @xcite .    the exponent of the fourth moment is related to the scaling of the nyquist noise of the random resistor network through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem as shown by rammal _",
    "thus , as for the second moment , the fourth moment is related to a macroscopic quantity and therefore is of direct experimental interest .",
    "however , no relation between the sixth moment of the current distribution and a directly measurable quantity has been identified .",
    "we determine @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 is the exponent of the @xmath21th moment in the constant current ensemble , we have @xmath42 .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath43 .",
    "this way , we can easily change between the two ensembles .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows @xmath41 as a function of @xmath21 , where we see that it behaves in the classic multifractal way @xcite : the three exponents we show do not fall on a straight line and as @xmath21 increases they approach a constant that must equal @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this is shown by the dashed line in the figure . to show this relation even more clearly",
    ", we plot in figure [ fig5 ] @xmath41 _ versus _ @xmath45 , and where we use for @xmath46 the best value we found for @xmath34 , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the dashed line is merely to guide the eye .",
    "it connects the point at @xmath47 to that at @xmath48 .",
    "we see that the exponents for the fourth and sixth moments are in agreement with this line although the sixth moment is starting to lose precision .",
    "these @xmath41 plots demonstrate the multifractality of the current distribution in this network , but the convergence to @xmath44 as @xmath49 is rather slow , especially when compared to the two - dimensional case @xcite .    the sample to sample fluctuations of the values of the conductivity ( @xmath50 ) and the fourth moment ( related the nyquist noise strength , let us call it @xmath51 )",
    "also yield interesting information about the system @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated in figure [ fig1]b that the variance of the conductance ( from sample - to - sample fluctuations ) scales as the conductance itself with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "exactly the same behaviour is observed for the variances of the higher moments .",
    "therefore , the distributions of @xmath52 from different size systems will collapse onto a single distribution .",
    "the same is true for @xmath53 . to characterize these distributions , we examined on semi - log scale these distributions against @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "such plots should yield straight lines for gaussian distributions . this way we found the distributions not to be normal , and a similar procedure showed them not to be lognormal . in figures",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , we show the distributions of @xmath52 and @xmath56 for different lattice sizes on semi - log scale plotted against @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for the larger values , we find in both plots straight lines which indicate exponetial distributions of the form @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "by using a combination of efficient algorithms and a massively parallel computer , we were able to do a high precision study of the distribution and moments of currents in a three dimensional network at the percolation threshold .",
    "our result for the conductivity exponent is in agreement with but more precise than previous values .",
    "in addition we evaluated the exponents for the fourth ( related to _ 1/f _ and nyquist noise ) and sixth moments .",
    "the values we have found support the notion of a multifractal current distribution for the three dimensional network .",
    "we have furthermore studied the sample - to - sample fluctuations and the distributions of the second ( conductivity ) and fourth ( noise ) moment of the current distribution .",
    "we find that the relative fluctuations scale as the moments themselves with lattice size , and that the underlying statistical distributions appear to be exponential rather than gaussian .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of conductivities at the percolation threshold has proven to be an important ingredient in the formulation of scaling theories for the optical properties ( ac conductivity , reflectivity , transmittivity ) of two - dimensional systems such as semiconductor metal films@xcite and metal - insulator composites@xcite .",
    "similar scaling theories in three dimensions , when constructed , will also need the distribution of the conductivities for three - dimensional systems at the percolation threshold , which we have presented in this paper .",
