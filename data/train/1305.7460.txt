    "nova kt eridani has an interesting history pre - dating its optical discovery .",
    "its discovery was reported several days after its actual outburst had commenced but in spite of this delay , recourse to archival material helped not only in pinpointing its exact date of eruption but also tracked its immediate post - outburst evolution as graphically as real - time nova observations usually do .",
    "the nova was discovered on 2009 november 25.536 ut by k. itagaki at @xmath6 = 8.1 ( yamaoka & itagaki 2009 ) with a 0.21 m telescope patrol system .",
    "itagaki also noted the presence of a faint object near the position of kt eri in his archival patrol images .",
    "yamaoka pointed out that the all sky automated survey ( asas-3 ) system ( pojmanski 1997 ) had detected kt eri on 3 occasions prior to the discovery announcement of yamaoka .",
    "these pre - discovery magnitudes along with additional detections are listed in table 1 .",
    "in addition yamaoka suggested that the discovery of kt eri might be the result of brightening of a 15th magnitude blue star , listed in many catalogues , with one of the identifications being usno - b1.0 0798 - 0048707 .",
    "guido et al . ( 2009 ) confirmed the discovery of kt eri using their ccd observations using a 0.25 m reflector and pointed out the presence of a star of @xmath4 15 mag close to the position of kt eri on the dss red plate of 1990 november 23 ut .",
    "the nature of kt eri as a nova was confirmed by several low resolution optical spectra obtained during 2009 november 26.5 - 26.6 ut by fujii , arai & isogai and imamura ( maehara 2009 ) .",
    "these spectra showed broad balmer emission ( fwhm of h@xmath15 3200 - 3400 km s@xmath5 ) together with prominent emission features of he i , n i , n ii , na i d , o i and mg ii leading maehara to suggest that kt eri is a nova of the he / n class .",
    "rudy et al . ( 2009 ) also suggested kt eri to be a nova of he / n class on the basis of their near - infrared spectra obtained on 2009 november 26.4 ut spanning the spectral range of 0.9 to 2.5 @xmath3 m .",
    "the he i line at 1.083 @xmath3 m was already the strongest line in the spectrum with a p cygni absorption extending to 3600 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the emission lines of h i , n i and o i were very strong and broad with fwhm @xmath4 4000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the reports of clear detection of kt eri prior to its discovery has resulted in additional studies by different groups to obtain its pre - discovery light curves .",
    "drake et al . (",
    "2009 ) carried out a search of the catalina sky survey data covering the location of kt eri during period 2005 january 17 to 2009",
    "november 18 .",
    "kt eri was clearly seen in outburst in the images taken on 2009 november 18 and they pointed out that the outburst occurred after 2009 november 10.41 ut .",
    "the study of pre - discovery light curve has shown clear variations of approximately 1.8 magnitudes .",
    "the association of an unresolved fainter companion to the 15th magnitude star to be the progenitor of kt eri would mean a very high level of variability .",
    "as this possibility is unlikely drake et al .",
    "( 2009 ) conclude that the 15th magnitude star is most likely associated with kt eri .",
    "ragan et al . ( 2009 ) derived a distance of @xmath4 6.5 kpc to kt eri and pointed out that the 15th magnitude star located close to the kt eri position in pre - discovery images is too bright to be its progenitor .",
    "mcquillin et al . ( 2012 ) and hounsell et al . (",
    "2010 ) have obtained an impressive high cadence optical light curve of kt eri before , during and after the outburst using data from superwasp ( pollacco et al .",
    "2006 ) and the usaf / nasa solar mass ejection imager ( smei ) ( jackson et al . 2005 ) on board the coriolis satellite ( eyles 2003 ) , respectively .",
    "the smei observations are spread over the period 2009 november 1.13 to 30.62 ut . the light curve , obtained by smei indicates that the initial rise of the nova is steep ( rising 4.1 magnitudes over 2.7 days ) with evidence of a pre - maximum halt occurring on 2009 november 13.90 @xmath8 0.04 ut at m@xmath16 @xmath4 6 .",
    "the duration of this halt would seem to be only a few hours , which is appropriate for the speed of the nova ( e.g. payne - gaposchkin 1964 ) .",
    "the nova reached maximum light on 2009 november 14.67 @xmath8 0.04 ut with an unfiltered smei apparent magnitude of m@xmath16 @xmath4 5.42 @xmath8 0.02 .",
    "it subsequently declined rapidly with a @xmath17 value of 6.6 days confirming kt eri as a very fast nova .",
    "the smei observations are consistent with the observed high expansion velocities ( fwhm @xmath4 3400 km s@xmath5 ) and assignment of he / n spectral class to kt eri described earlier .",
    "nesci , mickaelian & rossi ( 2009 ) have used the pre - outburst spectrum of the suspected 15th magnitude progenitor available in the digitized first byurakan survey of the field containing kt eri to study its nature .",
    "the spectra taken on 1971 january 25 shows a strong uv continuum with several emission lines that include [ ne v ] 3426 , [ ne iii ] 3868 and a large blend around h@xmath18 .",
    "as these features are typical of cataclysmic variables , nesci , mickaelian & rossi ( 2009 ) favour the identification of the 15th magnitude star with the actual progenitor of kt eri and point out that the forbidden lines of [ ne iii ] & [ ne v ] were also seen in the transient source css 081007 : 030559 + 054715 ( hv cet ) suggested to be a possible he / n nova located at high galactic latitude -43.7 deg ( prieto et al .",
    "2008 , pejcha , prieto & denney 2008 ) .",
    "a search for previous outbursts of kt eri was done by jurdana - sepic et al .",
    "( 2012 ) using the harvard college observatory archive plates spanning the period 1888 to 1962 .",
    "as no earlier outbursts were found , they have suggested that if kt eri is a recurrent nova , the recurrence time is likely to be on a time scale of centuries .",

    "( 2012 ) find a periodicity at quiescence of 737 days for the 15th magnitude progenitor that may arise from reflection effects and/or eclipses in the underlying binary system in kt eri .",
    "kt eri was detected later as a luminous soft x - ray source ( bode et al .",

    "before presenting the results proper , we estimate some of the useful parameters of kt eri like its reddening , distance and height relative to the galactic plane from an analysis of its light curve .      the light curves based on the @xmath6 band data from table 1 and american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) and the @xmath0 magnitudes from mt .",

    "we determine the absolute magnitude of the nova to be m@xmath23 = -8.9 @xmath8 0.1 .",
    "the reddening @xmath24 = 0.09 , is derived from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) towards the nova s direction for which a@xmath23 = 0.29 for r = 3.1 .",
    "based on the above we obtain a value of the distance @xmath10 = 6.3 @xmath8 0.1 kpc to the nova . using the value of @xmath10 we estimated the height @xmath25 = 3.3 @xmath8 0.1 kpc below the galactic plane .",
    "the high galactic latitude is consistent with the low reddening towards the nova .",
    "taking a bolometric correction of -0.1 appropriate for the sed of novae which resemble a to f type supergiants near maximum light and the absolute magnitude m@xmath23 = -8.9 determined above gives the the bolometric outburst luminosity of kt eri to be l@xmath26 @xmath4 3.2 @xmath12 10@xmath27 l@xmath14 .",
    "the optical and @xmath0 light curves show an additional small amplitude outburst near day 40 from the optical maximum .",
    "a plateau was also seen in the @xmath6 band light curve after 80 days from optical maximum .",
    "the duration of the plateau could be tracked for @xmath4 60 days but its entire duration is difficult to assess as the nova went into conjunction with the sun afterwards .",
    "the shape of the optical light curve of kt eri presented in fig .",
    "1 has all the characteristics of a p class of nova as per the classification system presented by strope , schaefer & henden ( 2010 ) .",
    "the observed value of the outburst amplitude of @xmath28 = 9.6 and @xmath29 = 5.7 days for kt eri is well below the lower limit in the amplitude versus decline rate plot for classical novae presented by warner ( 2008 ) which shows an expected value of @xmath28 = 12 to 15 for @xmath29 = 5.7 days .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the estimated value of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath28 are very much similar to those of the recurrent nova v745 sco which had corresponding values of 6.2 , 9.0 and 9.2 , respectively ( see table 17 , schaefer 2010 ) .",
    "so , if kt eri is indeed a recurrent nova , then the system may be similar to v745 sco and a possibility exists that the recurrence time for kt eri may be expected to be around 50 years similar to the 52yr recurrence time for v745 sco which had recorded outbursts in 1937 and 1989 ( schaefer 2010 ) .     and @xmath0 band",

    "the infrared observations presented here cover the phase after optical maximum with the first infrared spectra taken on 2009 november 28 . in case of he / n class of novae a smaller number of spectral lines in the near - ir",
    "are normally seen as compared to the fe ii type of novae ( banerjee & ashok 2012 ) .",
    "apart from this intrinsic difference between the two nova classes , the possibility exists of relatively weaker individual lines in he / n novae blending with each other due to large expansion velocities and becoming indistinguishable against the underlying continuum .",
    "the prominent lines seen in case of kt eri are those due to h i , o i and he i. the typical fwhm of the h i lines range from 1900 to 2300 km s@xmath5 with full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) reaching a value of @xmath4 4000 km s@xmath5 .",
    "a noticeable feature of these early spectra is the strong presence of lines due to he i. in the spectra taken on 2009 november 28 the he i lines at 1.0830 @xmath3 m , 1.7002 @xmath3 m , 2.0581 @xmath3 m , 2.1120 @xmath3 m and 2.1132 @xmath3 m are clearly seen .",
    "although it is blended with pa @xmath2 at 1.093 @xmath3 m , hei 1.0830 @xmath3 m is strikingly strong in the spectra .",
    "these he i lines are seen to strengthen and become even stronger as the nova evolves .",
    "no coronal lines are seen during the course of our observations .",
    "an upper limit can be set for the line flux , for e.g. for the [ s ix ] 1.2520 @xmath3 m line , of 4.6 @xmath12 10@xmath31 w@xmath32 assuming that a detection could be claimed if the line was present at 5@xmath33 of the observed continuum noise level ( measured to have a standard deviation of 1@xmath33 ) around the expected position of the line .",
    "this is based on the later spectra obtained in 2009 december .",
    "it is however difficult to set meaningful upper limits for other coronal lines generally seen in novae spectra because these are either not covered by us ( e.g. lines from [ si vi ] 1.964 @xmath3 m , [ si vii ] 2.481 @xmath3 m and [ ca viii ] 2.322 @xmath3 m in the k band ) or could be severely blended , if present , with other lines in the region ( e.g. [ al ix ] 2.040 @xmath3 m would be blended with the blue wing of the he i 2.0581 @xmath3 m ; br 10 line at 1.7362 @xmath3 m would blend with [ p viii ] at the same position etc ) .",
    "even the upper limit derived above for [ s ix ] 1.2520 @xmath3 m , assumes no contribution from he i 1.2534 @xmath3 m which occurs at almost the same wavelength .",
    "there is also no indication of dust formation in the nova which is consistent with the absence of emission lines from low ionization species like na and mg which are potential harbingers of dust formation ( das et al . 2008 ; banerjee & ashok 2012 ) .",
    "recombination case b analysis for the h i lines was done for the observed spectra of all days .",
    "representative results for four days ( see fig .",
    "5 ) show the observed strength of the brackett lines with respect to br12 which is normalized to unity .",
    "also shown are the predicted case b values from storey & hummer ( 1995 ) if the lines are optically thin .",
    "the case b values are for t = 10@xmath34 k and for a few representative electron densities of n@xmath35 = 10@xmath36 , 10@xmath37 and 10@xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "high electron densities are also considered because the ejecta material may be expected to be dense in the early stages after the outburst .",
    "5 shows that the observed line intensities clearly deviate from case b values during the initial observations .",
    "specifically , br@xmath18 , which is expected to be relatively stronger , for any combination of electron density and temperature in the case b scenario , than the other br lines considered here is observed to be considerably weaker in the early observations .",
    "this is certainly due to large optical depths in the br gamma line and possibly also in the other brackett lines ( e.g. lynch et al .",
    "such deviations from case b strengths , early after outburst , can be expected and have been observed in other novae too like v2491 cyg and v597 pup ( naik , banerjee & ashok 2009 ) . however , 25 days after maximum on 2009 december 9 ( fourth panel of fig .",
    "5 ) there is a clear - cut indication that case b conditions have begun to prevail implying the lines have become optically thin . for 2009",
    "december 9 , it is found that the observed data match well with the predicted values for the recombination case b values of t = 10@xmath34 k and an electron density n@xmath35 = 10@xmath37 @xmath39 .",
    "we use additional arguments to constrain the electron density and thereby estimate the mass .",
    "it is known from hummer & storey ( 1987 ) and storey & hummer ( 1995 ) that line center optical depth values can be significant when the electron densities become large .",
    "the value of the opacity factor @xmath40@xmath41 for different hi lines for transitions between levels @xmath42 at different temperatures and densities ( equation 29 of hummer & storey ( 1987 ) ) is tabulated in these studies . from the value of @xmath40@xmath41 ,",
    "the optical depth at line - center @xmath43@xmath41 is given by @xmath43 = @xmath44@xmath45@xmath40@xmath46 , where @xmath46 is the path length in cm . in our case , for the data of 2009 december 9 , we take l = 4.84 - 7.26 @xmath12 10@xmath47 cm corresponding to the kinematic extent of the ejecta using an expansion velocity between 2000 - 3000 km s@xmath5 ( ribeiro 2011 ; this work ) and a time of 28 days since start of outburst",
    ". slight variations in these numbers do not affect our analysis .",
    "since the lines are optically thin on 2009 december 9 , this means that @xmath43 must be less than 1 .",
    "for @xmath48 = 10@xmath34 k and @xmath44 = 10@xmath49 @xmath39 , the corresponding value of the optical depth @xmath43 from storey & hummer ( 1995 ) is then found to be 0.016 for br@xmath2 and this then decreases monotonically down the series to a value of @xmath43 = 0.003 for br 19 . at a higher density of @xmath44 = 10@xmath50 @xmath39 , the @xmath43 values increase sharply by approximately a factor of a few hundreds ( since @xmath43 @xmath51 @xmath52 ) to @xmath43 @xmath4 8 for br@xmath2 and 0.31 for br19 .",
    "hence , it is seen that the br@xmath2 line ( as also the other br lines ) is / are optically thin at a density of 10@xmath49 @xmath39 but becomes thick at 10@xmath50 @xmath39 .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath44 = 10@xmath49 @xmath39 in our calculations . in applying the relation @xmath43 = @xmath44@xmath45@xmath40@xmath46 given by hummer & storey ( 1987 ) , it is assumed that the volume filling factor is unity .",
    "this assumption is also carried into the analysis below which only aims at setting an upper limit for the ejecta mass .",
    "k and electron densities of n@xmath35 = 10@xmath38 @xmath39 ( dotted line ) , 10@xmath37 @xmath39 ( solid line ) and 10@xmath36 @xmath39 ( dashed line).,width=288,height=384 ]    following banerjee et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , a constraint on the mass of the emitting gas can be obtained from :    @xmath53    where @xmath10 is the distance , m@xmath54 the proton mass , @xmath55 the observed flux in a particular line , @xmath56 the corresponding case b emissivity ; v is the volume of the emitting gas , which is [ 4/3@xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the filling factor , velocity and time after outburst , respectively . using the value of temperature and electron density we calculated the mass of the gas in the ejecta in the range 2.4 - 7.4 @xmath1210@xmath13m@xmath14 .",
    "as the filling factor @xmath60 @xmath63 1 , this range is an upper limit for the mass of the ejecta .",
    "a significant finding that has emerged from the analysis of line - profile studies of kt eri is the likely presence of a bipolar flow in the ejected material ( ribeiro 2011 ) .",
    "bipolar morphologies are commonly encountered in planetary nebulae and explained on the basis of the fast - winds from the hot pn nuclei interacting with a non - uniform circumstellar environment . in this anisotropic scenario ,",
    "the pre - existing circumstellar material has a density enhancement in the equatorial plane which impedes the outflowing ejecta from expanding in the equatorial region while expanding relatively more freely in the polar direction .",
    "this leads to a constriction of the nebula with an hourglass shape .",
    "kinematically , this would imply that the matter in the poles would flow out with a high velocity relative to the matter in the waist of the hourglass .",
    "it is possible that the secondary , which has colors suggestive of a cool giant ( jurdana - sepic et al .",
    "2012 ) has either through mass loss or a common envelope phase provided the necessary equatorial density contrast needed to create the bipolar morphology ( bond & livio 1990 ) .",
    "it is also becoming increasingly apparent with the aid of high - spatial resolution imaging that hourglass or bipolar morphologies could be commonplace in novae shells ( chesneau & banerjee 2012 ) .",
    "striking examples of these are seen in the novae v1280 sco ( chesneau et al .",
    "2012 ) , v445 pup ( woudt & steeghs 2005 ) and rs oph ( bode et al .",
    "2007 , harman et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the kinematic evidence for a bipolar flow in kt eri is also seen from our near - ir data .",

    "further details are provided in section 3.5.,width=288,height=288 ]    it is seen that a three - component gaussian fits the data reasonably well .",
    "the fits for 2009 december 6 , 7 @xmath65 8 indicate the presence of two high velocity components at mean radial velocities ( averaged over the three days ) of -1790 @xmath8 75 and 2080 @xmath8 60 km s@xmath5 for pa@xmath64 and at -1800 @xmath8 115 and 2040 @xmath8 150 km s@xmath5 for the br@xmath18 lines , respectively ( these high velocity components appear to be associated with the faster structure reported by bode et al .

    "we can interpret the results of fig .",
    "6 as follows viz .",
    "the core emission can be associated with the slower expanding material from the waist of the bipolar ejecta while the higher velocity satellite components are associated with the flow from the polar regions .",
    "a similar high velocity bipolar flow in the case of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs oph was also deduced by banerjee , das & ashok ( 2009 ) on the basis of broad observed wings in pa@xmath1 and br@xmath2 line profiles .",

    "i.e. on 2009 november 28 ( 14 d after optical maximum ) and 2009 december 9 , the continuum spectrum are well matched with fits having spectral indices of @xmath67 = 3.34 @xmath8 0.10 and @xmath67 = 3.25 @xmath8 0.13 , respectively . the subsequent spectra taken on 2009 december 15",
    "have become slightly flatter with the slope of @xmath67 = 3.08 @xmath8 0.07 . as a comparison",
    ", we also show a plot ( with dotted line in fig .",
    "7 ) of the expected slope for a case of pure free - free emission evaluated at a representative temperature of t = 10,000 k.    proceeding further , we have also specifically tried to fit the sed for 2010 february 22 to 28 , shown in fig . 8 , because of the availability of contemporaneous data at that time including wise ( wide field infrared survey explorer ) observations ( wright et al .",
    "such data allows the sed to be fit over a much larger range in wavelength . in fig .",
    "8 we have used the @xmath70 data from aavso , @xmath0 data from mt .",
    "abu and wise data in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 wavebands which are centered at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath3 m respectively .",
    "the corrected flux values corresponding to all these various magnitudes are given in table 4 .",
    "what we find in fig .",
    "8 is that the continuum is remarkably well fit by a power law , with the spectral index @xmath67 further reduced to 2.67 .",
    "the slow change in the slope of the continuum spectrum index with time is also evident in the case of other novae , for example , v4643 sagittarii where it changed from a slope of about 3 to 2 within about three months ( ashok et al .",
    "however , in the case of another nova viz .",
    "v4633 sagittarii ( lynch , russel & sitko 2001 ) the change in the slope of the continuum was found to be in the opposite direction , i.e. the slope changed from 2 to 2.7 in observations taken 525 and 850 days after outburst .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the continuum in a nova s development can be fairly complex as also remarked by lynch , russel & sitko ( 2001 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the sed fit in fig .",
    "8 represents the behaviour of the nova in the plateau phase .",
    "the optical mid - plateau phase has been clearly seen earlier in a limited number of novae , notably in the recurrent novae rs oph , u sco and ci aql ( hachisu , kato @xmath65 luna 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "it is usually associated with a super - soft x - ray phase ( e.g. in rs oph as described in osborne et al .",
    "2011 ) and is interpreted as being caused by the accretion disk being irradiated by the central hot white dwarf ( hachisu , kato @xmath65 luna 2007 ) .",
    "the disk is bright as long as the white dwarf , which is rapidly shrinking and becoming hotter at this stage , is luminous because of a thin hydrogen shell still burning on its surface and it becomes dark when the shell - burning ends .",
    "the mid - plateau phase is poorly studied and a sed covering such a large extent in wavelength , possibly not available for any other nova , should be useful in interpreting this stage in a nova s development . in the case of a steady - state accretion disk around a white - dwarf , the continuum radiation from the disk can be described by a @xmath73 @xmath67 @xmath74@xmath75 relation ( mayo , wickramasinghe , whelan 1980 and references therein ) or equivalently @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68@xmath69 where @xmath67 = 2.33 .",
    "the observed spectral index @xmath67 of the sed is rather close to this value .",
    "however , the near - ir magnitudes of the suggested progenitor in quiescence indicate the secondary to be an evolved star ( discussed later in section 4 ; jurdana - sepic et al . 2012 ) so its contribution should dominate over the emission component from the accretion disc .",
    "but it would be interesting to verify , more stringently , what fraction of the observed energy arises due to the irradiated accretion disk emitting the reprocessed radiation of the central wd .",

    "these authors have utilized the 2mass infrared magnitudes to study the properties of the secondary star in kt eri as the ir colors are more sensitive to show signature of the secondary star .",
