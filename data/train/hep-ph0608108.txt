    "the aim of this paper is to present some details about the performance of the neutrino monte carlo generator of events developed at the wrocaw university .",
    "it differs from other generators ( e.g. neugen , nuance , neut ) @xcite in the treatment of the resonance region .",
    "our generator contains an explicit @xmath0 resonance excitation model but contributions from more massive resonances are absent .",
    "it is assumed that an average description of the cross section coming from those resonances is sufficient .",
    "in fact , in the low energy bnl data only the @xmath0 peak is clearly seen in all single pion production ( spp ) channels on free nucleon targets @xcite . in neutrino interactions with nucleus",
    "targets the fermi motion is supposed to average the cross section contributions from other then the @xmath0 resonance peaks .",
    "the performance of the wrocaw generator in the spp channels has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the agreement with available data is satisfactory . in order to cover the entire allowed kinematical region",
    "it is necessary to apply the dis formalism to produce the events also for values of invariant hadronic mass @xmath1  gev .",
    "two problems arise then : ( i ) how to model the structure functions in order to reproduce the correct value of the inclusive cross section and ( ii ) how to produce the final states .",
    "the generally accepted way to describe the structure functions is to use bodek - yang low @xmath2 modifications , which have been introduced on the basis of the electron scattering data @xcite .",
    "recently the neutrino scattering data from the chorus and nutev experiments on nuclear targets ( iron and lead ) have become available @xcite and further progress and cross checks will be possible . in order to produce final hadronic states several strategies can be adopted . in our approach",
    "we assume that interactions take place on separate constituent of the nucleon .",
    "the first step of fragmentation is performed by our generator and of remaining quark - diquark system by means of pythia6 routines based on the lund model @xcite .",
    "several parameters of pythia6 were fine - tuned to get a good agreement with data @xcite . in effect",
    "it is possible to produce dis events for small values of the invariant hadronic mass down to the threshold for the single pion production @xmath3 .",
    "the low @xmath4 dis events are used in order to model the non - resonant background @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally , in the fig .",
    "[ strange2 ] we show the cross section for neutral strange particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "data points are taken from @xcite .",
    "we notice the good agreement of the generator s predictions with the data .",
    "the predictions of the wrocaw mc generator of events are in satisfactory agreement with the data .",
    "nevertheless additional effort is necessary to fine tune some of the free parameters of the generator in order to improve it s performance .",
    "the work on the nuclear effects module of the generator is in progress .",
    "the authors would like to thank c. juszczak for many conversations and for participating in this project at various stages .",
