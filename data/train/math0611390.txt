    "since the mid - eighties there have been two clear categories of @xmath0-dimensional contact manifolds : overtwisted and tight .",
    "the first ones were introduced by eliashberg , following gromov ideas , and happened to satisfy a kind of @xmath3-principle making their study a mere homotopical question @xcite .",
    "tightness has been more evasive being a coarse classification a matter of only very recent research and being the study purely `` geometrical '' with no hope of @xmath3-principle flexibility .    a key result to understand this overtwisted class is a corollary of gromov s pseudoholomorphic curves foundational paper @xcite :    [ thm : gro ]",
    "every overtwisted manifold is non - fillable .",
    "several definitions can be given for fillability .",
    "the most restrictive one is stein - fillable .",
    "a contact manifold is stein - fillable if it can be expressed as a level hypersurface for a proper plurisubharmonic function on a stein manifold .",
    "it is very easy to check that locally , forgetting about the complex structure , a neighborhood of the manifold is symplectomorphic to a neighborhood of the @xmath4-section of the symplectization @xmath5 .",
    "this provides another definition .",
    "a contact manifold @xmath6 is symplectically fillable if there exists a symplectic manifold @xmath7 with boundary @xmath8 such that a neighborhood @xmath9 of the boundary is symplectomorphic to @xmath10 , d(e^t\\alpha))$ ] .",
    "there is also a concept of weak filling where the contact manifold @xmath6 is the boundary of a symplectic manifold @xmath7 satisfying that @xmath11 is a symplectic subspace for @xmath12 .",
    "this is usually referred to as @xmath13 being dominated by @xmath12 .",
    "again this is a weaker condition than being symplectically fillable .",
    "also , in dimension @xmath0 , it has been proved that these inclusions are strict , so we have @xmath14 theorem [ thm : gro ] works for weakly symplectic fillings .",
    "finally the division _ tight - overtwisted _ does not translate in a completely faithful way to the fillings since some examples of tight manifolds not having fillings at all have been found",
    ". however , in most of the cases tight manifolds are fillable .",
    "all the previous theory has been established only in dimension @xmath0 , since many of the examples of contact structures in higher dimension are expected to be stein - fillable .",
    "the main reason is that a good generalization of the concept of overtwisted to higher dimensions has been hard to find in the last 20 years .",
    "the first successful attempt has been @xcite .",
    "there , it has been shown that the existence of a special geometrical structure on a contact manifold automatically implies the non - fillability of it .",
    "this generalizes theorem [ thm : gro ] and shows that the definition makes some sense .",
    "let us show it .",
    "[ def : plastik ] a plastikstufe in a contact manifold @xmath15 is an embedding @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a closed @xmath18-dimensional manifold satisfying that    1 .",

    "@xmath23 is a family of singularities of elliptic type , i.e any small @xmath26-dimensional disk @xmath27 , transverse to @xmath23 , has an induced distribution @xmath28 with a singularity of elliptic type .",
    "the rest of the leaves of the foliation @xmath24 are of the form @xmath29 satisfying that their boundary is contained in @xmath30    a manifold with a plastikstufe is called overtwisted .",
    "plastikstufe in a @xmath31-dimensional manifold.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    recall that a @xmath26-dimensional plastikstufe is just an overtwisted disk .",
    "so far , it has been proved :    [ thm : plas_non ] an overtwisted manifold does not admit a semi - positive symplectic filling .    we mean by a semi - positive filling a weak symplectic filling given by a semi - positive symplectic manifold .",
    "this covers in particular stein fillings and exact symplectic ones .",
    "it is expected to have a result covering all the possible fillings .",
    "the main obstruction is technical and is due to not have used `` virtual cycles '' in the proof of theorem [ thm : plas_non ] . in the particular case of dimension @xmath31 all the fillings can be made `` semi - positive '' and so the theorem works for any filling .",
    "remark that in @xcite some sketches of the proof of a result similar to theorem [ thm : plas_non ] were already given .",
    "moreover , yuri chekanov also has an alternative proof to theorem [ thm : plas_non ] .",
    "this paper has the task of showing the existence of a very ample class of overtwisted contact manifolds .",
    "the main result we will prove is    [ thm : main ] assume that a contact manifold @xmath32 admits a codimension @xmath26 contact submanifold @xmath33 , with trivial normal bundle , such that the restricted contact form is overtwisted , then @xmath34 admits an overtwisted contact structure .",
    "later we will see that using theorem [ thm : main ] is simple to construct quite a lot families of high dimensional examples .",
    "for instance    [ coro : main ] the manifold @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a riemann surface with genus at least @xmath26 , admits an overtwisted contact structure .",
    "and so we immediately obtain    [ coro : main2 ] the connected sum of any contact manifold with @xmath35 admits an overtwisted contact structure .    in dimension @xmath31 , we obtain    [ coro : main3 ] the manifold @xmath37 admits an overtwisted contact structure .",
    "recall that this manifold has homology @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "so , it is not a sphere but it has a simple homology type .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture :    @xmath40 admits an overtwisted structure and so any contact manifold admits an exotic overtwisted structure .",
    "this would partially recover the familiar @xmath0-dimensional picture in which for any contact structure , it is possible to construct an overtwisted one homotopically equivalent as a plane distribution .",
    "recall that corollary [ coro : main3 ] gets close to this conjecture in dimension @xmath31 .",
    "finally observe that no examples of non - fillable contact structures had been found in dimension higher than @xmath0 .",
    "all the previous results are a huge source of such structures .",
    "in section [ sect : contact_conn ] we define a notion of parallel transport for contact fibrations which is a key step in our proof .",
    "the relation between a contact fibration and the group of hamiltonian contactomorphisms is important for our purposes and it is studied in section [ sect : contact_ham ] .",
    "next , we review some old and new constructions of contact structures in section [ sect : constructions ] .",
    "section [ sect : proof ] just places together all the previous results to prove the main theorem .",
    "finally some corollaries of the main theorem are obtained in section [ sect : remarks ] .",
    "in particular we give examples of high dimensional manifolds which admit contact structures both fillable and non - fillable lying in the same homotopy class of hyperplane fields .",

    "there is only one crossing point at time @xmath149 .",
    "recall that the monodromy at that time is given by the flow of the reeb vector field at a time @xmath150 .",

    "it is impossible to separate the disk using the monodromy from itself .",
    "one can check that any other choice of contact form offers the same result as there is a topological obstruction to separate the disk from itself using the reeb flow for small times .",
    "the previous result is not unexpected .",
    "also in dimension @xmath0 , it is simple to build immersed overtwisted disks for any contact @xmath0-dimensional manifold : those disks exist inside the standard contact ball .",
    "the problems arise when one tries to construct an embedded one . to do that with a plastikstufe we need to add some new ideas and to change a bit the topological picture .",
    "we are going to show how to produce an arbitrary hamiltonian contactomorphism by parallel transport on a cleverly chosen contact fibration .",
    "again the ideas of these results come from the symplectic fibrations case .",
    "however , we do not review that theory because all our results are clear enough without referring them to the symplectic counterparts .",
    "the hamiltonian vector field @xmath160 associated to the hamiltonian function @xmath161 is the unique vector field defined by the pair of equations : @xmath162    a computation shows that for any hamiltonian field @xmath163 , therefore the field preserves the contact structure .",
    "moreover    any contactomorphism connected to the identity , in the contactomorphism group , is the flow of a time dependent hamiltonian vector field .",
    "* if the contactomorphism is connected to the identity , it is generated by a time - dependent vector field @xmath164 .",

    "a contactomorphism @xmath166-close to the identity ( inside the contactomorphisms group @xmath167 ) can be generated by a @xmath168-small time dependent hamiltonian function .",

    "we keep the proof , but we adapt the details to our language .",
    "the result is    [ thm : geiges ] the fibered sum of contact fibrations over surfaces , satisfying that    * the fibers of each fibration are contactomorphic , * the normal bundles have opposite orientations ,    is a contact fibration .",
