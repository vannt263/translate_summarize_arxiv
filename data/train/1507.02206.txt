    "in recent years , research in the field of online social networks ( osns ) has grown dramatically with the evolution of technologies while harnessing big data . focusing on the relationships ( edges ) among users or profiles ( vertices ) ,",
    "osn analysis has emerged as one of the most popular and familiar approaches for examining interaction , information sharing , and collaboration among online users  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the field of _ complex networks _ has emerged as an independent research area , with strong connections to random graph theory from mathematics as well as to social network analysis by physicists , interested in understanding the behaviors of large - scale interacting networks .",
    "based on massive datasets of large - scale real - world osns such as twitter  @xcite , facebook  @xcite , flickr  @xcite , and foursquare  @xcite , extensive studies have validated that the small - world phenomenon ( originally introduced by watts and strogatz  @xcite ) and scale - free degree distribution , which are the two most representative features of complex networks , nearly hold in osns  @xcite .",
    "twitter is one of the most popular micro - blogs ( or social media ) , allowing users to  tweet \" about any topic within the 140-character limit and to  follow \" others to receive their tweets . at the start of 2015 , twitter played a vital role in facilitating social contacts , boasting 284 million active users per month , publishing 500 million tweets daily from their web browsers and smart phones .      to understand the nature of friendships online with respect to geographic distance",
    ", some efforts have focused on users online profiles that include their city of residence  @xcite . in  @xcite , experimental results based on the livejournal social network demonstrated a close relationship between geographic distance and probability distribution of friendship , where the probability of befriending a particular user on livejournal is inversely proportional to the positive power of the number of closer users .",
    "contrary to  @xcite , based on the data collected from tuenti , a spanish social networking service , it was found in  @xcite that social interactions online are only weakly affected by spatial proximity , with other factors dominating .",
    "however , the effect of distance on online social interactions has not yet been fully understood . in the previous studies ,",
    "the geographic location points only to the location of users at a _ city scale_. for this reason ,",
    "the friendship degree distribution contains a background probability that is independent of geography due to the city - scale resolution  @xcite . on the other hand , _",
    "geo - located twitter _ can provide high - precision location information down to 10 meters through the global positioning system ( gps ) interface  @xcite of users smart phones while offering comprehensive metadata with a gigantic sample of the whole population .",
    "for this reason , there is extensive and growing interest among researchers to understand a variety of social behaviors through geo - located twitter , or , equivalently , geo - tagged tweets  @xcite . even if geo - tagged tweets account for approximately 1% of the total amount  @xcite , thanks to the increasing penetration of smart devices and mobile applications , the volume of geo - located twitter has grown constantly and now forms an invaluable register for understanding human behavior and modelling the way people interact in space . in  @xcite , along with geo - locations for collected tweets , analysis included how geo - related factors such as physical distance , frequency of air travel , national boundaries , and language differences affect formation of social ties on twitter . in  @xcite",
    ", it was found that the geo - locations of twitter users across different countries considerably impact their participation in twitter , their connectivity with other users , and the information that they exchange with each other . as another application ,",
    "the use of geo - tagged tweets was evaluated as a complementary source of information for urban planning including i ) a technique to determine land uses in a specific urban area based on tweeting patterns and ii ) a technique to identify urban points of interest at places with high tweeting activity  @xcite .",
    "new approaches based on geo - tagged tweets were also proposed to find top vacation spots for a particular holiday by applying indexing , spatio - temporal querying , and machine learning techniques  @xcite and to detect unusual geo - social events by measuring geographical regularities of crowd behaviors  @xcite .    benefiting from the increasing availability of location information from geo - tagged tweets ,",
    "there has been a steady push to understand individual human mobility  @xcite , which is of fundamental importance for many applications to human and electronic virus prediction and traffic and population forecasting .",
    "recent effort has focused on the studies of human mobility using tracking technologies such as mobile phones  @xcite , gps receivers  @xcite , wifi logging  @xcite , bluetooth  @xcite , and rfid devices  @xcite as well as location - based social network check - in data  @xcite , but these technologies involve privacy concerns or data access restrictions . in contrast , geo - tagged tweets can capture much richer features of human mobility .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , global human mobility patterns were widely revealed , and a comparative study on the mobility characteristics of different countries was conducted .",
    "furthermore , it was found in  @xcite that the geo - located twitter data for australia reveals multiple modes of human mobility from intra - site to metropolitan and inter - city movements . as another point of view , in  @xcite",
    ", it was reported that in australia , the gravity law is applicable for estimating human mobility by showing that mobility between an origin and its destination is proportional to the product of populations of these two places and is inversely proportional to the power - law of distance between them . in  @xcite , the problem of labelling the places of a city based on collected spatio - temporal data was addressed , including i ) to infer whether a place belongs to a certain category or not and ii ) to choose the category of a place among a set of categories .      in our work , we utilize _ geo - tagged mentions _ on twitter , sent by users , to identify their exact location information . a ` mention ' in twitter",
    "consists of inclusion of  @username \" anywhere in the body of tweets .",
    "from the fact that we tend to interact offline with people living very near to us , we derive as a natural extension the question whether geography and social relationships are inextricably intertwined on twitter .",
    "our research significantly differs from a variety of studies on human mobility in the literature  @xcite since it is interested in how a pair of users interacts . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", such an attempt to analyze one - to - one friendship based on geo - located tweets ( or mentions ) has not yet been described in the literature .",
    "as people normally spend a substantial amount of time online , data regarding these two dimensions ( i.e. , geography and online social relationships ) are becoming increasingly precise , thus motivating us to build more reliable models to describe social interactions  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have employed large amounts of data from diverse sources , such as smart devices and web - based applications , to examine how social data resources ( e.g. , photos on flickr ) are processed with tagging  @xcite .",
    "both a co - clustering approach  @xcite and a spatial ranking approach  @xcite have been introduced to discover meaningful relationships between a set of relevant resources and a set of tags .",
    "this paper goes beyond past research to determine how friendship patterns are geographically represented by twitter , analyzing a single - source dataset ( to avoid potential confounds ) that contains a huge number of geo - tagged mentions from users in i ) the state of california in the united states ( us ) and los angeles ( the most populous city in the state ) and ii ) the united kingdom ( uk ) and london ( the most populous city in the uk ) .",
    "these two location sets were selected as demographically comparable , yet distinct and geographically separated , leading adopters of twitter with sufficient data to enable meaningful comparative analysis for our intentionally exploratory study ( which will be specified in section ii ) . in this dataset , each mention record has a geo - tag ( spatial information ) and a timestamp ( temporal information ) indicating from where , when , and by whom the mention was sent .",
    "we propose and apply the following new framework , which establishes a more accurate friendship degree on twitter , and a method to enable analysis based on geographic distance :    * to fully take into account the intensity of communication between users , we start our analysis by introducing a rather strong definition of  _ friend _ \" on twitter , i.e. , a definition of _ bidirectional friendship _ , instead of navely considering the set of followers and followees ( unidirectional terms ) .",
    "this definition requires bidirectional communication within a designated time frame to constitute a friendship . * using the above definition , we introduce a friend counting algorithm , which computes the distribution of the number of friends for each twitter user . * by showing that almost all twitter users are likely to post consecutive tweets in the static mode , we propose a two - stage distance estimation method , where the geographic distance between two befriended users ( denoted by users @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) based on our definition of bidirectional friendship is estimated by sequentially measuring the two senders locations .",
    "more specifically , the location of user @xmath0 is recorded at the moment when user @xmath0 sends a mention to user @xmath1 , while the location of user @xmath1 can also be recorded when user @xmath1 sends a replied mention to user @xmath0 at the next closest time , enabling estimation of the distance between users @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that the above definition is suitable for evaluating one - to - one bidirectional social interactions on twitter since twitter users tend to personally interact with only a few of their followers / followees by sending and receiving direct mentions .",
    "we would like to synthetically analyze how the geographic distance between twitter users affects their interaction , based on our new framework .",
    "our main contributions are as follows :    * based on the definition of bidirectional friendship , we first verify that the number of friends of _ one user _ on twitter follows a power - law distribution ( i.e. , a zipf s distribution  @xcite or a pareto distribution  @xcite ) even on twitter , which is known to be asymptotically equivalent to the degree distribution of scale - free networks .",
    "this finding is consistent with the earlier results in other osns .",
    "* next , more interestingly , we characterize a newly - discovered probability distribution of the number of friends according to _ geographic distance _ , which does not follow a homogeneous power - law but , instead , a _",
    "double power - law _",
    "( i.e. , a _ double pareto law _",
    "@xcite ) . from this new finding",
    ", we identify not only two fundamentally _ separate regimes _ , termed the intra - city and inter - city regimes , which are characterized by two different power - laws in the distribution , but also the _ separation point _ between these regimes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the dataset , and section iii explains our analysis methodology . in section iv ,",
    "experimental results are presented by analyzing the number of friends of a particular user and the number of friends with respect to distance .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper with some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we use a dataset collected from crawling the twitter network via twitter streaming application programming interface ( api ) , which returns tweets matching a query provided by the streaming api user .",
    "although the twitter streaming api only returns at most a 1% sample of all the tweets produced at a given moment , it constitutes a valid representation of users activity on twitter when more specific parameter sets such as different users , geographic bounding boxes , and keywords are created ( thereby enabling extraction of more data from the streaming api )  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the streaming api returns an almost complete set of _ geo - tagged _ tweets despite sampling  @xcite .",
    "thus , there is no doubt that this research is working with an almost complete sample of geo - located twitter data .    in our work",
    ", we examined data from all possible devices ( sources ) that indicate the user s location information at the time that they access twitter .",
    "the statistics based on our dataset demonstrate that a large majority of the twitter users in our sample posted geo - tagged tweets through smart phones rather than web browsers on a desktop or laptop computer .",
    "this reveals that our dataset is much more inclined toward geo - tagged tweets ( more rigorously , geo - tagged mentions ) transmitted through the gps interface .",
    "the dataset consists of a huge amount of geo - tagged mentions recorded from twitter users from september 22 , 2014 to october 23 , 2014 ( about one month ) in the following four large regions : california , los angeles , the uk , and london .",
    "note that this short - term ( one month ) dataset is sufficient to examine how closely one user has recently interacted with another online ( i.e. , a personal online relationship between two users ) .",
    "the four regions in our dataset were selected since they are quite comparable at both the macro ( state or country ) and micro ( city ) scales in terms of i ) area , ii ) population density , and iii ) twitter popularity ( e.g. , the number of twitter accounts or the number of posted tweets ) .",
    "the comparison between location sets for the aforementioned three representative attributes is summarized in table  i , divided according to the types of two geographic scales .",
    "[ table1 ]    .statistics of the dataset : the number of mentions and unique users in each region . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table6 ]    * in the intra - city regime , the distribution @xmath2 decays slowly with distance @xmath3 , which means that geographic proximity weakly affects the number of intra - city friends with which one user interacts .",
    "that is , in this regime , the geographic distance is less relevant for determining the number of friends .",
    "this finding reveals that more active twitter users tend to preferentially interact over _ short - distance _ connections .",
    "* in the inter - city regime , @xmath2 depends strongly on the geographic distance , where there exists a sharp transition in the distribution @xmath2 beyond the separation point @xmath4 .",
    "thus , _ long - distance _ communication is made occasionally .",
    "the above argument stems from the fact that the separation point @xmath4 is closely related to the length and width of the city in which a user resides . from these observations",
    ", we may conclude that within a given period , the individual is much more likely to contact online mostly friends who are in location - based communities that range from the local neighborhood , suburb , village , or town up to the city level .",
    "in addition , the following interesting comparisons are performed according to types of regions :    * * comparison between the city - scale and state - scale / country - scale results * : we observe that the separation point @xmath4 in populous metropolitan areas is much greater than that in larger regions that include local small towns ( such as at the state or country level ) .",
    "for example , from figures  [ fig : distance_ca ] and  [ fig : distance_la ] , we see that @xmath4 is approximates 8 km and 22 km in california and los angeles , respectively . from figures  [ fig : distance_uk ] and  [ fig :",
    "distance_london ] , the same trend is observed by comparing the results for the uk and london ( 18 km and 21 km , respectively ) .",
    "this finding reveals that twitter users in populous metropolitan areas ( e.g. , los angeles and london ) have a stronger tendency to contact friends on twitter who are geographically away from their location ( i.e. , interacting over long - distance connections ) .",
    "this is because the average size ( referred to as the land area ) of the considered metropolitan cities is relatively bigger than that of cities in larger regions including small towns .",
    "furthermore , it is seen that the exponent in the inter - city regimes ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) in metropolitan areas is significantly higher than that in larger regions . unlike the state - scale / country - scale results",
    ", this finding implies that the distribution @xmath2 sharply drops off beyond @xmath4 in huge metropolitan areas .",
    "* * comparison between the results in the two cities ( los angeles and london ) * : from figures  [ fig : distance_la ] and  [ fig : distance_london ] , one can see that @xmath6 is 0.60 and 0.38 and @xmath5 is 6.23 and 7.13 in los angeles and london , respectively .",
    "thus , in the intra - city regime , the geographic distance is less relevant in london for determining the number of friends .",
    "however , in the inter - city regime , the distribution @xmath2 in london shows a bit steeper decline .",
    "our geo - tagged twitter data provides position resolution at up to 10 meters , compared to the typical city - scale resolution in previous studies on friendship  @xcite , thus allowing much more fine - grained validation of these heterogeneous behaviors in terms of distance .",
    "the present work has developed a novel framework for analyzing the degree of bidirectional online friendship via twitter , while not only utilizing geo - tagged mentions but also introducing a definition of bidirectional friendship . to provide analysis results , we first introduced two new algorithms , the first for counting friends and the second for a two - stage distance estimation algorithm .",
    "we verified that the homogeneous power - law model , also known as zipf s law , holds on twitter in terms of the number of friends of one user .",
    "more interestingly , we comprehensively demonstrated that the number of friends according to geographic distance follows a double power - law distribution , or equivalently , a double pareto law distribution , where there exists a strict separation point in distance that distinguishes the intra - city regime from the inter - city regime .",
    "our analysis sheds light on a new understanding of social interaction / relationships online with regard to small - scale space as well as large - scale space .",
    "characterization of the degree of friendship in space along with a greater variety of city / state / country - scale data on twitter remains for future work .",
    "suggestions for further research in this area also include analyzing a new friendship in the temporal domain ( time ) by utilizing geo - located twitter .",
