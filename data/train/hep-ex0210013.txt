    "the measurement of the hadronic cross section at low energy is of great importance for the improvement of the theoretical error of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath6 .",
    "the hadronic contribution @xmath7 is given by the hadronic vacuum polarization and can not be calculated at low energy in the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "following a phenomenological approach , the hadronic contribution can however be evaluated from the measurement of r through a dispersion relation .",

    "the error of the hadronic contribution is therefore given by the limited knowledge of hadronic cross section data .",
    "this error is the dominating contribution to the total error of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 )  @xcite + the discrepancy between the theoretical calculation  @xcite , and the recent experimental value of @xmath17  @xcite depends if @xmath18 data are used or not in the evaluation of @xmath19  @xcite ; a recent re - evaluation of the hadronic contribution to @xmath17  @xcite found : @xmath20 = @xmath21 @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 = @xmath24 @xmath25 $ ] , corresponding to 3.0 and 1.6 standard deviations respectively , reflecting also a @xmath26 discrepancy between @xmath27 and @xmath18 evaluations of @xmath19 .",
    "a discussion on this subject can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "this unclear situation makes a precise measurement of the hadronic cross section at low energy mandatory , particularly in the channel @xmath3 , which is the main ingredient for @xmath19 .",
    "such a cross section has been already measured by the cmd-2 collaboration with an energy scan in the range below 1.4 gev  @xcite ; an accuracy of 0.6% was recently achieved in the region between 0.61 and 0.96 gev  @xcite .",

    "@xcite i. e. studying the process @xmath30 hadrons@xmath31 .",
    "the emission of one photon before the beams interact ( initial state radiation , isr in the following ) lowers the interaction energy and makes possible to produce the hadronic system with an invariant mass varying from the @xmath28 mass down to the production threshold .",
    "the method represents an alternative approach to the conventional energy scan used so far for hadronic cross section measurements .",
    "a very solid theoretical understanding of initial state radiation ( described by the radiation function @xmath32 ) is mandatory in order to extract the cross section @xmath29(@xmath2 hadrons ) as a function of @xmath33 from the measured differential cross section @xmath34(@xmath2 hadrons@xmath31)@xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath33 and @xmath37 are respectively the invariant mass squared of the hadronic system and the acceptance cut on the polar angle of the photon .",
    "radiative corrections for @xmath38 , have been calculated up to isr nlo by different theoretical groups  @xcite , and recently implemented in a new monte carlo generator named phokhara  @xcite , this generator with a claimed accuracy of 0.5% has been used in the present analysis .",
    "we want to stress that the radiative return has the merit compared with the conventional energy scan that the systematics of the measurement ( e.g. normalization , beam energy ) are the same for any experimental point and must not be evaluated at each energy step .",
    "however a precise determination of the angle of the hard photon as well as the full control of events with the photon emitted in the final state ( pure qed fsr or other resonant processes , as for example @xmath39  @xcite ) , is required .",
    "due to the importance of the @xmath40 final state for @xmath19 , we concentrated at kloe on the analysis of the radiative process @xmath4 , whose feasibility has been extensively studied by monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "kloe @xcite is a typical @xmath41 multiple purpose detector with cylindrical geometry , consisting of a large helium based drift chamber ( dc , @xcite ) , surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc , @xcite ) and a superconducting magnet ( @xmath42 t ) .",
    "the detector has been designed for the measurement of @xmath43 violation in the neutral kaon system , i.e. for precise detection of the decay products of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "it will be shown in the following that an efficient selection of the @xmath65 signal is possible , without requiring an explicit photon detection .",
