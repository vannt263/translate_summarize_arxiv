    "recently , stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) provide a quantitative description for a lot of mathematical models in areas such as physics , engineering , biology , geography and finance .",
    "many specialists exert a strong interest in spdes and develop their mathematical theories and analytical techniques . however , it is a difficult target to obtain the analytical solutions of spdes .",
    "thus , how to estimate the numerical solutions of spdes becomes a fast growing research area .",
    "a lot of modern numerical tools are devised to solve spdes such as the stochastic collocation method  @xcite , the it taylor expansions method  @xcite and the finite element method combining with monte carlo and quasi - mote carlo method  @xcite .",
    "but there are still great many unsolved problems of the numerical solutions of spdes .",
    "the books  @xcite show that the kernel - based approximation method to solve deterministic high - dimensional pdes , and moreover , this method can be also applied into the stochastic models mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "it offers us a new idea to apply the kernel - based approximation method ( kernel - based collocation method , meshfree approximation method ) to obtain numerical solutions of high - dimensional spdes given in our recent paper and doctoral thesis  @xcite .",
    "its approximate basis induced by the positive definite kernel ( reproducing kernel ) is different from the polynomial basis of the finite element method , which means that the construction of the kernel basis does not need an underlying triangular mesh .",
    "furthermore , the data points can be flexibly chosen for the use of either deterministic or random design , e.g. , halton points or sobol points .",
    "after the discussions of this fresh numerical method with many mathematicians and engineers , we determine to renew and improve the analytical results and numerical algorithms of our previous papers by their nice and helpful suggestions .",
    "we want to let this numerical tool for spdes be well readable in the interdisciplinary fields of both computational mathematics and statistics . in section  [ sec : gauss - rk - pb ] , we extend [ theorem  3.1 ,  @xcite ] and [ theorem  7.2 ,  @xcite ] into theorem  [ t : gauss - pdk - pb ] such that we can replace integral - type kernels by more general positive definite kernels to construct gaussian fields in the classical @xmath0-based sobolev spaces instead of the reproducing kernel hilbert spaces",
    ". we will employ these gaussian fields to introduce the kernel - based approximate solutions of spdes similar as the techniques of  @xcite .",
    "their approximate kernel bases are set up by the positive definite kernels with the related differential and boundary operators defined as in the equation  , and the covariance matrixes of the gaussian fields at the collocation points given in the formula   are used to compute their expansion random coefficients .",
    "the blocks of the covariance matrixes are corresponding to the pairwise of collocation points .",
    "the covariance matrixes can be seen as the generalization forms of the traditional kernel - based interpolation matrixes discussed as in @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : ell - spde - ker - sol ] complements the construction processes and the proofs of the kernel - based approximation method , and we even give the new kernel - based approximate results for solving a system of high - dimensional linear elliptic spdes driven by various kinds of right - hand - side random noises , which are unsolved in the final remark section of  @xcite .",
    "the kernel - based approximate solution is obtained for fitting the observation values simulated by the elliptic spdes .",
    "the kernel - based approximate solution of the elliptic spdes is a linear combination of the kernel basis , and moreover , its expansion random coefficients are solved by a random linear system whose random parts are simulated by the elliptic spdes ( see the equations  ( [ eq : ker - based - sol - linear - ell]-[eq : ker - based - sol - coef - linear - ell ] ) ) .",
    "proposition  [ p : prob - convergence - linear - ell - spde ] shows that the errors of the kernel - based estimators can be bounded by the fill distances in the probability sense .",
    "the fill distance denotes the radius of the largest ball which is completely contained in the space domain and which does not contain the chosen collocation points .",
    "this means that the kernel - based approximate solutions are convergent to the exact solutions of the elliptic spdes in probabilities and distributions .",
    "we present more detail of the error analysis for the elliptic spdes than in  @xcite , and we discuss the convergent analysis by the knowledge of statistical learning  replacing the maximum error bound to the confident interval  in a different way of the classical kernel - based approximation method for the deterministic pdes .    in section  [ sec : par - spde - ker - sol ] , we use the implicit euler scheme to discretize the parabolic spde driven by time and space lvy noises at time in order to transform it to serval elliptic spdes at each discretization time step .",
    "next we solve these elliptic spdes by the kernel - based approximation method .",
    "we also briefly discuss the convergence of the kernel - based approximate solutions of the parabolic spdes undone in  @xcite .",
    "we will consider many other time - stepping schemes and their convergent rates in our future research .",
    "the numerical examples for the sobolev - spline kernels and the compact support kernels show that the approximate probability distributions are well - behave for the second - order parabolic spdes driven by the time and space poisson noises ( see figure  [ fig : par - spde - num - exa ] ) .",
    "since the covariance matrixes of the compact support kernels are sparse , we can solve the related linear systems as fast as the finite element method .",
    "more numerical examples will be posed in the author s personal webpage .    in our next paper",
    ", we will use the extended theoretical results given in this article to set up the kernel - based estimators for the nonlinear spdes driven by lvy noises .    in our previous papers and doctoral thesis of spdes , the kernel - based approximation method is also called the kernel - based collocation method . but some people may confuse the original name with another different method as stochastic collocation . in the same way as in the book  @xcite we recall this numerical method its general name , and moreover , its estimator is said the kernel - based approximate solution or the kernel - based solution in this article .",
    "the kernel - based approximation method , the kernel - based collocation method and the meshfree approximation method are the same in all our spdes papers .",
    "we want to make a convenience for the engineers and the computer scientists to understand the kernel - based approximation method and avoid its technical details and proofs . in the beginning",
    "we give a traditional example of the parabolic spde   to explain the kernel - based approximate processes and algorithms in a simple way .",

    "<S> in this paper , we improve and complete the theoretical results of the kernel - based approximation ( collocation ) method for solving the high - dimensional stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) given in our previous papers . according to the extended theorems </S>",
    "<S> , we can use more general positive definite kernels to construct the kernel - based estimators to approximate the numerical solutions of the spdes . because a parabolic spde driven by lvy noises can be discretized into serval elliptic spdes by the implicit euler scheme at time . </S>",
    "<S> we mainly focus on how to solve a system of elliptic spdes driven by various kinds of right - hand - side random noises . </S>",
    "<S> the kernel - based approximate solution of the elliptic spdes is a linear combination of the positive definite kernel with the differential and boundary operators of the spdes centered at the chosen collocation points , and its random coefficients are obtained by solving a system of random linear equations , whose random parts are simulated by the elliptic spdes </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , we introduce the error bounds  </S>",
    "<S> confident intervals  of the kernel - based approximate solutions of the elliptic ( parabolic ) spdes in terms of fill distances ( or possible time distances ) in the probability sense . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a well coding algorithm to compute the kernel - based solutions of the second - order parabolic spdes driven by time and space poisson noises . </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional numerical experiments show that the approximate probability distributions of the kernel - based solutions are well - behave for the sobolev - spline kernels and the compact support kernels .    </S>",
