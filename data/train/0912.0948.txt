    "oort ( 1950 ) postulated the existence of a cloud of comets orbiting the sun with typical semi - major axes , @xmath2 , of @xmath3au .",
    "this cloud is required to explain the existence of long period comets and the fact that a considerable fraction of these comets have orbital energies concentrated in a narrow range , corresponding to @xmath4 au@xmath5 . however , to date no direct observation of objects in the oort cloud exist .",
    "dynamical simulations suggest that the oort cloud was formed by the ejection of icy planetesimals from the jupiter - neptune region by planetary perturbations ( e.g. , duncan et al 1987 ; dones et al .",
    "2004 ) . on orbital",
    "time scales , galactic tides and passage of nearby stars raised the perihelia of these comets above the region of the giant planets influence .",
    "comets with semi - major axes above @xmath6au are loosely bound to the sun , and tides by the galactic potential ( e.g. , heisler & tremaine 1986 ) as well as impulse by passing nearby stars , may send these comets to the inner solar system where they reveal themselves as long period comets .",
    "in contrast , oort cloud objects with @xmath7au ( `` inner oort cloud '' ; e.g. , hills 1981 , bailey 1983 ) have more stable orbits .",
    "we note that the inner `` boundary '' of the oort cloud , @xmath8 , is set by perturbations due to the giant planets and the primordial stellar neighborhood of the sun .",
    "this @xmath8 is estimated to be in the range of 1,000au to 3,000au ( duncan et al .",

    "; fernndez 1997 ) .",
    "below @xmath8 the number of comets steeply falls due to planetary influence .",
    "dynamical simulations suggest that the spatial density of oort cloud objects in the 3,00050,000au range falls as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ( e.g. , duncan et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the current flux of long period comets calibrated by dynamical simulations suggest that the outer oort cloud ( i.e. , @xmath11au ) contains @xmath12 comets with nuclei absolute planetary magnitude brighter than 16mag ( e.g. , heisler 1990 ; weissman 1996 ) .",
    "this magnitude roughly corresponds to objects with radius of 2 km ( assuming @xmath13 geometric albedo ) .",

    "will improve our understanding of the mass of the solar - system planetary accretion disk , and the dynamical processes in the young solar system .",
    "moreover , it may bear some clues to the stellar density at the region in which the sun was born ( e.g. , fernndez 1997 ; fernndez & brunini 2000 ; brasser et al .",
    "however , these objects are beyond the direct reach of even the currently largest planned telescopes , and some indirect methods ( e.g. , astrometric microlensing ; gaudi & bloom 2005 ) .    bailey ( 1976 )",
    "suggested that small kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) as well as oort cloud objects could be detected by occultations of background stars .",
    "indeed several surveys are looking for kbo occultations ( e.g. , roques et al .",
    "2006 ; lehner et al . 2009 ; chang et al . 2006 , 2007 ; bianco et al . 2009 ; schlichting et al .",
    "however , to date there is only one reported occultation of a kuiper belt object ( schlichting et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this letter",
    "we discuss the potential of space missions designed to search for transiting exo - planets ( e.g. , _ kepler _ , _ corot _ ) to detect occultations of background stars by small oort cloud and kuiper belt objects .",
    "space telescope designed to look for exo - planet transits usually have exposure times , @xmath14 , longer by orders of magnitude than the typical duration of an occultation of a background star by a small solar system object , @xmath15 .",
    "the relative flux decrement of such an occultation @xmath16 , integrated over the exposure time , is diluted by a factor @xmath17 .",

    "the occultation `` shadow '' pattern of an object can be described as a set of bright and `` dark '' concentric rings with the central ring ( around the `` poisson peak '' ) being dark with an angular radius of @xmath69 .",
    "the area in all the rings is constant ( @xmath70 ) so the angular width of the rings is inversely proportional to its angular distance from the center ( e.g. , fig .  1 in nihei et al 2007 ) .",
    "the depth of the decrement in the flux in the dark rings is @xmath71 so the value of @xmath16 for the central ring occultation is @xmath72 .",
    "this decrement remains similar in all the dark rings as long as the ring width is smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "therefore @xmath74 .    for each of the five cases we use the approximations described above and give formula ( table  [ tab : nev ] ) for the expected number of events as a function of the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath19 , @xmath14 , @xmath75 , @xmath26 , @xmath58 and @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig : sat_starsangraddist ] we present the estimated angular radii distribution of target stars observed by _",

    "40 and 34 , respectively ) .",
    "we note , however , that this number is highly uncertain .      to estimate the rate of occultation events we integrate the appropriate formulas in table  [ tab : nev ] over @xmath77 , @xmath26 , @xmath75 and @xmath19 co - distributions .",

    "contrary to transits and grazing transits by extra - solar planets , solar system occultations will appear in a single photometric measurement and they happen only once .",
    "therefore , verification of each event by itself will require a thorough understanding of the noise properties of the photometer .",
    "_ kepler _ will have about @xmath162 15-min independent photometric measurements .",
    "assuming purely gaussian noise , the 8-@xmath163 detection threshold we adopted corresponds to a probability of @xmath164 .",
    "however , even small deviations from a gaussian noise may impair our confidence in the astrophysical nature of the events .    here",
    "we present two tests that can be used to check if the occultations signature are due to real events or due to some sort of uncharacterized noise .",
    "in addition , these tests can be used to statistically measure @xmath37 and to distinguish between oort cloud objects and kbos .",
    "the occultation rate depends on the relative velocity @xmath77 , with a somewhat different dependency in each regime . therefore , if a large number of occultations are detected , a simple sanity test is to look for the dependency of the events rate on @xmath77 .",
    "we note that since _ kepler _ is observing at high ecliptic latitude the @xmath77 modulation will be small ( eq .  [ eq : vrel ] ) compared to the maximal modulation which will be seen by an instrument observing the ecliptic .",
    "moreover , in all the cases ( a  e ) , the function @xmath165 depends on @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the modulation is related to @xmath37 and the occultation type ( i.e. , a ",
    "knowing the occultation regime ( see below ) , we can measure @xmath37 ( i.e. , removing the degeneracy between @xmath37 and @xmath165 ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in table  [ tab : nev ] the occultations rate depends on @xmath19 , which depends on the stellar magnitude and on @xmath75 , which in turn is a function of the star magnitude and effective temperature .",
    "we expect bright and angularly small stars to have higher chance of producing detectable occultations .",
    "moreover , this dependency is different for the various occultation cases .",
    "this can be used to further test the nature of the occultations , by comparing the distribution of magnitudes and effective temperatures of the stars showing occultations to those of the entire observed stellar population .",
    "most importantly , for a _ kepler_-like observatory , kbo occultations will be mostly in the diffractive regime , while oort cloud object occultations will be in the geometric regime ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sat_starsangraddist ] ) .",
    "therefore , the magnitude and @xmath75 of occulted stars by kbos and oort cloud objects will follow different co - distributions .",
    "therefore , we can statistically distinguish between oort cloud and kbo occultation events .",
    "however , quantifying these effects and estimating the number of occultations needed to carry out the suggested analysis requires a more realistic estimate of the events rate ( i.e. , using full numerical integration of light curves ) and a full exploration of the parameters space .    to summarize ,",
    "we show that _ kepler _ and similar space missions can detect deca - kilometer objects in the oort cloud .",
    "we present statistical methods to verify that the occultations are real rather than due to uncharacterized noise .",
    "in addition we suggest that it will be possible to statistically measure their size distribution ( @xmath37 ) , and the dominant occultation regime , and therefore differentiate between oort cloud objects and kbos .",
    "considering _ kepler _ capabilities and reasonable oort cloud parameters , we find that _ kepler _ may detect 0 to @xmath166 stellar occultations by oort cloud objects .",
    "we find that _ kepler _ is unlikely to detect kuiper belt objects ( mainly because of its high ecliptic latitude pointing ) .",
