    "a persistent problem in polymer science is the theoretical description of the mass dependence of the viscosity of polymer melts of linear chains.@xcite a model which recently lead to some progress@xcite is the rubinstein  duke ( rd ) model,@xcite which is a discrete model that maps the reptation dynamics of a three dimensional polymer onto a lattice  gas .",
    "this model takes into account tube length fluctuations as well as the effect of a possible external electric field which acts on a charged polymer .",
    "+ in the reptation model the stretching of the polymer is caused by an entropic tensile force acting on the chain ends.@xcite in the rubinstein model this force is parameterized by the lattice dimension which provides the rates for adding and removing new segments to the tube . adding ( resp . removing ) new segments",
    "is modeled in the lattice ",
    "gas picture by the creation ( resp .",
    "annihilation ) of particles at the boundaries .",
    "the stretching of the polymer corresponds to the particle density in the bulk .",
    "although the real spatial dimension of the polymer network ( naturally @xmath0 ) determines the possibilities of the polymer to stretch and by this it is directly related to the creation rate , this rate is not only influenced by the dimension because the dynamics of the boundary segments of a polymer is affected by more mechanisms than pure geometry .",
    "+ rubinstein investigated the influence of the creation and annihilation rates on the viscosity which is proportional to the relaxation time and showed that the magnitude of the viscosity increases with increasing creation rates . due to particle number conservation in the bulk",
    "the particle density is provided by the boundary dynamics  none",
    "the less the density is a property of the bulk and different boundary dynamics may lead to the same density .",
    "this feature of the model corresponds to a realistic property of the polymer : if the behavior of the boundary segments is changed , the stretching of the polymer will not necessarily be affected . in order to investigate whether the boundary dynamics or the particle density determines the relaxation time we consider two models : the standard rubinstein  duke model and a modified version .",
    "the model is only modified at the boundaries in a way that in the bulk the particle density and thus the entropic force remains unchanged.@xcite + we will show that the particle density is the crucial property , so that it is reasonable to specify the density dependence of the relaxation time explicitly . as a hypothesis we convert the known density dependence of the diffusion constant to an expression for the relaxation time . this hypothesis is confirmed by our numerical data implying that we have on the one hand determined the density dependence and on the other hand verified the conversion of the diffusion constant to the relaxation time .",
    "however , we also show that microscopic details of chain end dynamics have an appreciable impact on the absolute value of the viscosity and its scaling .",
    "rubinstein assumes that the constraints of the other polymers divide space into cells which form a @xmath1dimensional regular cubic lattice .",
    "the polymer occupies a series of adjacent cells , the `` primitive path '' .",
    "it is not possible for the polymer to traverse the edges of the cells ( in two dimensions : the lattice points ) so that only the ends of the polymer can enter new cells .",
    "the polymer is divided into segments whose lengths are of the order of the lattice constant , the number of segments is proportional to the length of the polymer or the molecular weight .",
    "the ends of the segments are labeled with imaginary particles called `` reptons '' .",
    "the orientation of the lattice is introduced by duke in a way that the electric field is diagonal to the lattice , i.e. in three dimensions the ( 111)direction , which is relevant e.g. for the investigation of electrophoresis . in this paper",
    "we will only consider the limit of zero field ",
    "nevertheless we will keep a reference axis along which the displacement of the polymer chain as a whole can be monitored.@xcite + a repton is allowed to jump into an adjacent cell according to the following rules : +    1 .",
    "the reptons in the bulk are only allowed to jump along the primitive path .",
    "2 .   no cell in the interior of the primitive path may be left empty .",
    "3 .   the ends move freely provided rule 2 is respected .",
    "if an end repton occupies the cell alone , it can only retract in the cell of the adjacent repton .",
    "if the adjacent repton is in the same cell , the end repton may enter any of the @xmath2 surrounding cells .",
    "reptons in the bulk jump with the same probability as reptons at the end into occupied cells .",
    "rule 1 refers to the diffusion of defects and ensures that the polymer does not traverse the topological constraints which are represented by the edges of the cells in the model .",
    "rule 2 refers to the connectivity of the polymer and is motivated by the fact that the segments are of the size of the lattice constant and are not allowed to stretch .",
    "finally rule 3 reflects the fact that there are more free adjacent cells for an end repton than occupied ones  this introduces the entropic tensile force .",
    "+ as the shape of the primitive path is not affected by the movement of the polymer and only the ends are created or annihilated this model can be mapped onto one dimension . to this end a particle representation is used : starting on one end , a segment into the direction of the reference axis is identified with an @xmath3particle , against the axis with a @xmath4particle and finally a segment within one cell by a vacancy @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ reptonmodel ] ) .",
    "+ these particles are residing on a chain whose number of sites @xmath6 is the number of segments , thus the number of reptons minus one . as for each site",
    "three states @xmath7,@xmath4,@xmath8 are possible this model can be identified with a quantum spin ",
    "one chain .",
    "@xcite + the one  dimensional dynamics of the particles is the following : in the bulk , @xmath3 and @xmath4particles interchange freely with vacancies @xmath9 , but may not traverse each other . by these rules",
    "it is guaranteed that the shape of the primitive path is conserved .",
    "+ at the boundaries , particles may be annihilated with rate @xmath10 , i.e. transformed into vacancies , or created with rate @xmath11 , i.e. the transformation of vacancies into particles . within the approach of rubinstein the annihilation is a process with the same rate as the hopping in the bulk which is a basic process ( rate is assigned to @xmath12 ) , i.e. @xmath13 . the creation of particles is @xmath1times more probable , because at the boundaries there are @xmath2 cells to enter , @xmath1 along and @xmath1 against the direction of the field , while in the bulk there is only one cell to enter . hence according to rubinstein , @xmath14 .",
    "+ in this way a stochastic interacting particle system on a one dimensional chain has been defined . as",
    "the transitions are independent of the previous history this process is markovian .",
    "a convenient way to describe the process mathematically is the quantum hamiltonian formalism which we will present here briefly , for details see ref . .",
    "+ assigning to the particles and the vacancy one of the three - dimensional basis vectors each , a configuration of the spin chain can be represented by the tensor product @xmath15 of these vectors .",
    "the probability to be in state @xmath15 at time @xmath16 is labeled by @xmath17 .",
    "these probabilities of the individual states can be combined to a vector : @xmath18 . due to the conservation of probability the entries of the vector @xmath19 sum up to 1 at any time @xmath16 . with this definition",
    "the master equation can be written as : @xmath20 with the stochastic generator @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the transition probability from state @xmath23 to @xmath24 . in other words",
    "the off diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath25 are the negative transition rates between the respective states and the diagonal elements are the sum of the rates leading away from the respective state .",
    "+ the creation operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , acting on any other state yields zero .",
    "the annihilation operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 are defined by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , again acting on any other state yields zero .",
    "finally we define the number operators @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ". by these definitions the stochastic generator @xmath25 of the rd model reads : @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38\\\\ & + & \\beta\\left[n_n^a - a_n+n_n^b - b_n\\right ] \\\\",

    "we present how to determine the stretching and then how to calculate the viscosity .",
    "+ each particle contributes a length of the order of the lattice constant @xmath39 to the primitive path , so that the length of the primitive path equals @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total number of particles on the chain .",
    "the stretching of the polymer corresponds to the length to the primitive path divided by the number of bonds @xmath6  or in the particle picture to the particle density @xmath42 .",
    "the particle density @xmath42 is determined by the creation rate @xmath11 and the annihilation rate @xmath10 . in the bulk",
    "the density on _ one _ site changes only due to the hopping process : @xmath43 here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side equals the gain of particle which is proportional to the occupation of the site with vacancies and proportional to the occupation of the adjacent sites with particles .",
    "accordingly , the second term describes the loss of particles .",
    "supplementary at the boundaries @xmath46 we have to take creation and annihilation into account : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 and the index @xmath49 for @xmath50 respectively @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "we have to consider the rate @xmath53 because both @xmath3 and @xmath4particles are counted by @xmath54 . as we are only interested in the stationary state we presume @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "( [ eq_nk ] ) then yields @xmath57 with constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 . finally , eq . ( [ eq_nrand ] ) determines @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "+ so the stationary total particle number @xmath60 is calculated to@xcite @xmath61 and for the particle density @xmath62 we get @xmath63 in the rd model one therefore has @xmath64 .",
    "the viscosity is proportional to the longest relaxation time of the stochastic generator@xcite @xmath25 which is the inverse energy gap of the spin chain .",
    "a very efficient algorithm to calculate the lowest excitations of quantum spin chains is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm.@xcite for the standard rd model the usefulness of this algorithm has been demonstrated,@xcite so that we employ this algorithm as well for the modifications of the rd model .",
    "the dmrg algorithm is a numerical method to diagonalize huge matrices whose systematic is known .",
    "this is done by reducing the hilbert space to the most important states which are chosen by calculating their probability using the density matrix .      in order to investigate the influence of the boundary dynamics the following modification of the model",
    "is considered : in the bulk the dynamics of the particles remains unchanged . at the boundaries the creation and annihilation rates are chosen as if the chain was in contact with a particle reservoir , as described in ref . .",
    "in the reservoir the density of @xmath3particles is labeled with @xmath65 , the density of @xmath4particles is the same , so that the total density is @xmath42 . the creation of particles at the boundary is identified with the hopping of a particle from a boundary site of the reservoir onto a boundary site on the chain . as the probability to find",
    "an @xmath3 or @xmath4particle on a site of the reservoir is @xmath65 each , the rate for the creation process has to be chosen as @xmath65 . accordingly",
    ", the annihilation of a particle corresponds to the hopping of a particle from the boundary of the chain into the reservoir .",
    "this hopping is only possible when the boundary site of the reservoir is empty which happens with the probability @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , this is the annihilation rate . using eq .",
    "( [ eq.dichte ] ) it is easily calculated that this boundary dynamics provides a particle density @xmath42 in the bulk .",
    "+ if we want to provide the same particle density as in the rd model with lattice dimension @xmath1 , we therefore have to choose the creation rate @xmath67 and annihilation rate @xmath68 .",
    "the modified rates differ from the previous ones by a factor @xmath69 .",
    "a physical interpretation of this modification of the model is that the dynamics of the boundary reptons is slowed down , as the rates for creation and annihilation are reduced .",
    "experimentally this could be seen for polymers with bulky end groups .",
    "we calculate in the standard rd model the relaxation times for @xmath0 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "small values of @xmath1 seem to be rather artificial  however , as the entanglement network is not regular cubic but instead contains also very small pores , one may investigate smaller effective dimensions than @xmath0 .",
    "an illustrative argument is that it is much easier to pull a thread out of the eye of a needle than to pass it through  by this the retracting of a polymer should be more probable than entering a new cell . + for @xmath0 one has a density @xmath73 so that the length of the primitive path is @xmath74 with the lattice constant @xmath39 and number of bonds @xmath6  so the polymer is nearly stretched . for the other dimensions the length of the primitive path calculates to @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , the length decreases clearly .",
    "+ to compare the standard rd model with the modified boundary dynamics , we compute the relaxation times in the modified model with the same particle densities .",
    "the results for both models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ eta ] .     + with decreasing @xmath1 the relaxation time decreases in both models .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that a shorter tube relaxes faster . in the particle picture",
    "this is justified by considering that the relaxation process is the traversion of a particle from one end of the chain to the other . as for a lower particle density",
    "the diffusion is faster this process takes less time .",
    "+ one can observe two qualitative results : firstly compared to the rd model the relaxation times of the reservoir boundary dynamics are shifted to higher values .",
    "secondly it is obvious that the influence of the particle density is much stronger than the influence of the boundary dynamics .      after having verified in the last section that the particle density is crucial for the relaxation time , in this section",
    "the dependence is quantified . to this end",
    "a method for computing the diffusion constant from the relaxation time is presented . as the density dependence of",
    "the diffusion constant is known@xcite this leads to a hypothesis for the density dependence of the relaxation time . by verifying this hypothesis not only the density dependence",
    "is found but also the validity of the computation of the diffusion constant is proved .",
    "+ as the rd model is a projection to a specific axis , the diffusion constant along this axis will be calculated which differs only by a constant factor from the three dimensional diffusion constant .",
    "the projected end to end length of the polymer is the difference of the number of @xmath3 and @xmath4particles , @xmath81 .",
    "the one dimensional diffusion can be identified with a random walk : after the relaxation time @xmath82 the polymer has moved by a distance @xmath81 in or against the direction of the field , i.e. @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "assuming that the random walker starts at @xmath85 the following relation holds ( for sufficiently large times @xmath16 so that the number of steps is well described by @xmath86 ) : @xmath87 which yields @xmath88 because the @xmath89 are uncorrelated : @xmath90 . thus calculating the diffusion constant yields @xmath91 + as described in ref .",
    "the expectation value is calculated by @xmath92 with the `` summation vector '' @xmath93 and the stationary state @xmath94 . with a product ansatz",
    "the stationary state can be computed to@xcite ( here with generalized creation and annihilation rates @xmath11 respectively @xmath10 ) @xmath95^{\\otimes l},\\ ] ] so that @xmath96 thus we get for the diffusion constant the expression @xmath97 + in ref . or it is shown that the density dependence of the diffusion constant is @xmath98 the term @xmath99 corrects finite size effects of the length dependence .",
    "thus the density dependence of the relaxation time should be @xmath100 so that the expression @xmath101 should be independent of @xmath42 . in order to avoid length corrections the limiting case @xmath102 is considered by extrapolating the term @xmath103 by the algorithm of bulirsch and stoer ( bst ) as described in ref . .",
    "+ in the bst algorithm a degree of freedom @xmath104 has to be chosen whose size is of the order of the correction exponent of the extrapolated series , but whose influence on the result of the extrapolation is usually not critical . for the plotted data @xmath105",
    "was used , because in this region a stable area could be found . only for the reservoir with @xmath106 no convergence of the algorithm could be achieved .",
    "the error of the extrapolation is determined by a variation of @xmath104 in the stable area .",
    "+ contrary to expectations the extrapolated values show some dependence on the parameter @xmath104 . for @xmath107 which is the assumed correction exponent@xcite lower values",
    "are found but a significant @xmath42 dependence can not be found .",
    "+ the results for the different boundary dynamics and particle densities are plotted in fig .",
    ". in consideration of the error bars no density dependence can be found so that we have found the correct density dependence .",
    "the density dependence found here confirms the dependence conjectured by rubinstein,@xcite who proposes a density dependence of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the number of cells which can be entered by an end repton ( which is @xmath2 in our notation ) .",
    "the factor @xmath109 corresponds exactly to @xmath110 and the additional factor @xmath111 results from the fact that our time scale is @xmath111times the time scale used by rubinstein , so that every time measured in our scale must be multiplied by a factor of @xmath111 when being compared to the rubinstein scale .",
    "we have thus shown that the conjecture is not only valid for the rubinstein model but also for generalizations .",
    "as in polymer physics the scaling of the viscosity with the polymer weight @xmath112 is investigated intensively we will now focus directly on this quantity .",
    "experiments show a scaling of @xmath113 for several magnitudes of polymer weight and a crossover to an exponent of @xmath114 in the limit of infinitely long chains . + the effective exponent of the scaling is given by the local slope @xmath115 in the log  log  plot , which is calculated by @xmath116 fig .",
    "[ exp ] shows the effective exponent for both boundary dynamics with @xmath0 . as abscissa values",
    "we have chosen @xmath117 because according to doi the finite size correction should be of this order .",
    "compared to the rd model the reservoir  dynamics shifts the effective exponent to smaller values , with increasing chain length the deviation decreases . while the rd model shows an exponent in the region which is found experimentally at least in a small range , the values found for the reservoir",
    " dynamics are too small . but",
    "using once again the bst  algorithm it can be shown that both curves approach @xmath118 for @xmath119 : for @xmath0 we get for the rd model @xmath120 and for the reservoir ",
    "dynamics @xmath121 . for other values of @xmath1",
    "the same qualitative results can be found , but for smaller values of @xmath1 the difference of the curves decreases .",
    "+ so we conclude that although the influence of the boundary is much smaller than the influence of the parameter @xmath1 , for some quantities the type of boundary dynamics is crucial .",
    "we see that the effective exponent is a very sensitive quantity for which the type of model which is used for the chain end dynamics is of big influence .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the influence of the boundary dynamics on the viscosity of polymer melts by comparing the rubinstein  duke model to a model with modified boundary dynamics .",
    "the model is modified in a way that the entropic force which leads to the stretching of the polymer remains the same . in the lattice gas picture",
    "this is achieved by introducing particle reservoirs at the boundaries which provide the required particle density corresponding to the stretching of the polymer .",
    "+ we find that the influence of particle density and hence the influence of the entropic force is bigger than the influence of the details of the chain end dynamics .",
    "the dependence of the viscosity on the particle density is quantified in general recovering the conjecture of rubinstein as a special case .",
    "focusing on the scaling of the viscosity we observe that the exponent seen in experiments is recovered much better with the rubinstein ",
    "duke dynamics than with its modifications .",
    "nevertheless both models lead to the same exponent of 3 in the limit of infinitely long chains .",
    "so although the chain end dynamics has smaller influence on the viscosity of polymer melts than the particle density it nevertheless affects considerably the scaling of the viscosity .",
