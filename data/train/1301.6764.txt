    "the lepton mixing angles have the distinctive feature that the atmospheric angle @xmath9 and the solar angle @xmath10 , are both rather large @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for the reactor angle @xmath11 was first provided by t2k , minos and double chooz  @xcite .",
    "subsequently daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite , and double chooz  @xcite collaborations have measured @xmath12 : @xmath13    this rules out the hypothesis of exact tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing  @xcite , and many alternative proposals have recently been put forward @xcite , although there are relatively few examples which also include unification @xcite . for example , an attractive scheme based on trimaximal ( tm ) mixing remains viable @xcite , sometimes referred to as tm@xmath14 mixing since it maintains the second column of the tb mixing matrix and hence preserves the solar mixing angle prediction @xmath15 .",
    "however there is another variation of tm mixing which also preserves this good solar mixing angle prediction by maintaining the first column of the tb matrix , namely tm@xmath16 mixing @xcite .",
    "although there were models of tm@xmath14 mixing which can account for the smallness of the reactor angle @xcite , the first model in the literature for tm@xmath16 mixing , which also fixed the value of the reactor angle , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model discussed in @xcite was actually representative of a general strategy for obtaining tm@xmath16 mixing using sequential dominance ( sd ) @xcite and vacuum alignment .",
    "the strategy of combining sd with vacuum alignment is familiar from the constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) approach to tb mixing @xcite where a neutrino mass hierarchy is assumed and the dominant and subdominant flavons responsible for the atmospheric and solar neutrino masses are aligned in the directions of the third and second columns of the tb mixing matrix , namely @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the new idea was to maintain the usual vacuum alignment for the dominant flavon , @xmath19 as in csd , but to replace the effect of the subdominant flavon vacuum alignment by a different one , namely either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , where such alignments may be naturally achieved from the standard ones using orthogonality arguments .",
    "we referred to this new approach as csd2 , with a subdominant flavon alignment @xmath22 , leading to tri - bimaximal - reactor ( tbr ) mixing @xcite in which only the reactor angle is switched on , while the atmospheric and solar angles retain their tb values . ] and showed that it leads to tm@xmath16 mixing and a reactor angle which , at leading order , is predicted to be proportional to the ratio of the solar to the atmospheric neutrino masses , @xmath23 .",
    "the model was proposed before the results from daya bay and reno , and the prediction turned out to be rather too small compared to the results in eq .  .",
    "more generally it has been shown that any type i seesaw model with two right - handed neutrinos and two texture zeros in the neutrino yukawa matrix ( as in occam s razor ) is not compatible with the experimental data for the case of a normal neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "however this conclusion ignores the effect of charged lepton corrections , and so an `` occam s razor '' model which includes such corrections may become viable .    in the present paper",
    "we construct a fully renormalisable unified @xmath3 model in which the neutrino sector satisfies the csd2 conditions , and show that , with spontaneous cp violation and a suitable vacuum alignment of the phases , the charged lepton corrections can correct the reactor angle , bringing it into agreement with results from daya bay and reno .",
    "we shall use here similar techniques as in @xcite , where spontaneous cp violation with flavon phases determined by the vacuum alignment was discussed for the first time , in order to ensure that the charged lepton mixing angle correction ( typically about @xmath24 ) adds constructively to the @xmath25 angle from the neutrino sector ( typically about @xmath26 ) leading to @xmath27 , within the range of the measured value from daya bay and reno .",
    "in fact the present model is more ambitious , since it describes all quark and lepton masses and mixing angles , including predictions for all the cp violating phases .",
    "we demonstrate the viability of the model by performing a global fit to the charged lepton masses and the quark masses and mixing parameters . for the neutrino mixing angles",
    "we make a parameter scan and find very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we emphasise that the present @xmath3 model represents one of the first unified `` indirect '' family symmetry models in the literature that has been constructed to date that is consistent with all experimental data on quark and lepton mass and mixing parameters where `` indirect '' simply means that the family symmetry is completely broken by the vacuum alignment . for",
    "a review see @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that the idea of spontaneous cp violation has a long history @xcite .",
    "however , in explicit flavour models using this idea only the positions of the phases in the mass matrices was predicted , but not the phases of the flavon fields themselves ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "spontaneous cp violation with calculable flavon phases from vacuum alignment was first discussed in @xcite and demonstrated in example models based on @xmath0 and @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we shall use a similar approach where the @xmath0 model is formulated in the real @xmath29 basis ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and where we only consider the real representations @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in such a framework , one can either use a `` simple '' cp symmetry under which the components of the scalar fields transform trivially as @xmath32 , or a `` generalised '' cp symmetry which intertwines cp with @xmath0 ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in the latter case , in our basis",
    ", the triplet fields would transform as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 interchanges the second and third component .",
    "when complex @xmath35 and @xmath36 representations are used in a model , the @xmath34 transformation then takes care of the fact that under cp the two complex singlets are interchanged with each other .",
    "however , as already mentioned above , in our model this will make no difference .",
    "cp symmetry leads to real coupling constants in a suitable field basis ( after `` unphysical '' phases have been absorbed by field redefinitions ) .",
    "cp is subsequently spontaneously broken by the flavon vacuum alignment , which is controlled by additional abelian symmetries @xmath37 and @xmath38 , resulting in calculable complex flavon phases as in @xcite .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows : in the next section we discuss the general strategy we will adopt in our model . after a brief review of csd2",
    "we discuss charged lepton sector corrections to tm@xmath16 mixing before we describe the method which we use to fix the flavon vevs . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe our model , the field content and symmetries and the resulting yukawa and mass matrices .",
    "the justification for the chosen vacuum alignment including phases is given in section [ sec : flavon ] .",
    "in the subsequent sections we comment on the higgs mass and then we give the numerical results from our global fit and scans . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize and conclude and in the appendix we define our notations and conventions and give the messenger sector of our model .",
    "let us now describe our general idea in somewhat more detail , before we present an explicit gut model example in the next section .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , we are combining three ingredients which finally result in a highly predictive unified flavour model .",
    "these ingredients are :    * csd2 for the neutrino mixing angles @xmath39 , * charged lepton mixing contributions as they are typical in guts , * spontaneous cp violation with aligned phases .",
    "we now briefly describe these three concepts and the resulting new class of models .      in models with csd2 @xcite ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is dominated by two right - handed neutrinos with mass matrix @xmath40 and couplings to the lepton doublets @xmath41 and @xmath42 was also considered in @xcite , but here we shall not consider it further . ] such that the neutrino yukawa matrix takes the form @xmath43 , in left - right convention .",
    "a summary of the used conventions is given in the appendix .",
    "after the seesaw mechanism is implemented , csd2 leads to the following light effective neutrino majorana mass matrix : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and where @xmath47 is the relative phase difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we define @xmath50 , and assume @xmath51 leading to a normal mass hierarchy in accordance with sd .",
    "as discussed in appendix [ app : conventions ] we use here different conventions than in the original csd2 paper @xcite which are more convenient in the context of @xmath52 guts .",
    "only three parameters , e.g.  @xmath48 , @xmath53 and @xmath47 , govern the neutrino masses and mixing parameters . for the mixing parameters , the predicted values are , to leading order in @xmath53 ( from @xcite with adapted conventions . ] ) : @xmath54 the mixing scheme resulting from csd2 can be identified as trimaximal mixing of type 1 ( i.e.  tm@xmath16 @xcite ) but with a predicted value of the neutrino 1 - 3 mixing , @xmath55 . with neutrino mass @xmath56",
    ", only one majorana cp phase is physical . without charged lepton corrections , @xmath57 would be identical with the leptonic dirac cp phase @xmath58 .",
    "let us also note that csd2 predicts a deviation of @xmath59 from @xmath60 , depending on the phase @xmath47 .      in gut models",
    "the charged lepton yukawa matrix is generically non - diagonal in the flavour basis , due to the close link between the charged lepton and the down - type quark yukawa matrices , which typically provides the main origin of the flavour mixing in the quark sector . with the cabibbo angle @xmath61 being the largest mixing in the quark sector ,",
    "the mixing in @xmath62 is often dominated by a 1 - 2 mixing @xmath63 as well , such that the relevant part of ( the hierarchical matrix ) @xmath62 can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are real and where the entries marked by a @xmath68 are not relevant for our discussion here . with @xmath69 one",
    "can read off to leading order the values for the complex 1 - 2 mixing angle ( for more details see also appendix [ app : conventions ] ) that are @xmath70 since we will have @xmath71 in our example gut model in the next section , let us consider this case also in the following discussion .    in explicit gut models ,",
    "@xmath63 is typically related to the cabibbo angle by group theoretical clebsch factors from gut breaking , as has been discussed recently , e.g.  in @xcite . in many gut models ,",
    "in particular in those where the muon and the strange quark mass at the gut scale is predicted by such a clebsch factor as @xmath72 @xcite , but also if the yukawa matrices @xmath62 ( and @xmath73 ) are ( nearly ) symmetric with a zero in the ( 0,0)-element @xcite , @xmath74 is predicted as @xmath75 in the example gut model in the next section we will see explicitly how such a prediction arises in an @xmath52 gut .",
    "the leptonic mixing parameters , defined via @xmath76 , are a combination of the mixing from the neutrino and the charged lepton sectors .",
    "making use of the fact that , to leading order , @xmath77 , and using the csd2 expressions from above for the neutrino sector , and general formulae for the charged lepton mixing contributions of @xcite @xmath78 we obtain ( up to @xmath79 ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "when the phases @xmath47 and @xmath67 are fixed by the vacuum alignment , and when also @xmath74 is predicted from the gut structure , as both will be the case in our model , all three mixing angles and also the cp phases @xmath58 and @xmath82 , are predicted .",
    "thus , the resulting models of this type can be highly predictive .",
    "we would like to note here already that in the explicit gut model in the next section , we will construct a vacuum alignment such that @xmath83 , leading to is motivated by the current data which favours @xmath9 in the first octant . on the other hand",
    ", one can in principle also construct other models with different values of @xmath47 , and there are also other options for @xmath67 and @xmath74 , which may lead to interesting alternative models . in this sense , the strategy described here leads to a whole new class of possible models . ]",
    "@xmath84 close to the best fit value for the normal hierarchy case from global fits to the neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the alignment of @xmath67 will satisfy @xmath85 , such that the neutrino and charged lepton contributions to @xmath11 simply add up , leading to ( with @xmath86 ) @xmath87 in agreement with the recent measurements . with these values of @xmath47 and @xmath67",
    ", it also turns out that @xmath10 is predicted somewhat smaller than @xmath88 , namely @xmath89 this value of @xmath10 could be distinguished from the tribimaximal value by a future reactor experiment with @xmath90 km baseline @xcite .",
    "finally , the third ingredient is spontaneous cp violation with aligned phases of the flavon vevs , using the method proposed in @xcite . to give a brief summary of this method ,",
    "let us note that phase alignment can very simply be achieved using discrete symmetries when the flavon vevs effectively depend on one parameter , i.e. when the direction of the vevs is given by the form of the potential .",
    "this remains true even in the presence of `` generalised '' cp transformations as long as these cp transformations fix the phases of the involved coupling constants .",
    "working example models with @xmath0 and @xmath28 family symmetry can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath28 is in agreement only with `` simple '' cp , while the `` generalised '' cp transformation for @xmath0 interchanges the complex singlet representations @xcite . in both cases all the coupling constants",
    "are forced to be real in a suitable field basis .",
    "to illustrate the phase alignment , let us consider a case with a flavon field @xmath91 which is a singlet under the family symmetry and singly charged under a @xmath92 shaping symmetry ( with @xmath93 ) .",
    "then typical terms in the flavon superpotential , which `` drive '' the flavon vev non - zero , have the form @xmath94 the field @xmath95 is the so - called `` driving superfield '' , meaning that the @xmath96-term @xmath97 generates the potential for @xmath91 which enforces a non - zero vev .",
    "@xmath98 is the ( real and positive ) suppression scale of the effective operator , and @xmath99 here is simply a ( real ) mass scale . from the potential for @xmath91 , @xmath100 the vev of @xmath91 has to satisfy @xmath101",
    "since the right side of the equation is real , we obtain that @xmath102 for example , with a @xmath37 shaping symmetry and a `` @xmath103 '' in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flavonpotentialzn ] ) , only multiples of @xmath104 are allowed for @xmath105 . we will use this method for the relevant flavons to constrain their phases . in the ground state , one of the vacua ( with a fixed phase )",
    "is selected , which finally determines also the two phases @xmath47 and @xmath67 relevant for the predictions in the lepton sector .",
    "furthermore , we note that we will also use the phase alignment to generate the cp violation in the quark sector , predicting a right - angled unitarity triangle , which is in excellent agreement with the present data ( making use of the quark phase sum rule from @xcite ) .",
    "we now turn to an explicit gut model , where the above described strategy is applied .",
    "in the following we will construct an @xmath3 model with csd2 @xcite in the neutrino sector .",
    "the model follows the strategy described in the previous section , such that the charged lepton mixing contribution to @xmath11 adds up constructively with the 1 - 3 mixing in the neutrino sector to @xmath27 , with the phases fixed by the `` discrete vacuum alignment '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "we start with the superpotential bilinear in the fields which is in our case only the mass terms for the messengers @xmath106 the full list of messenger fields is given in table  [ tab : messengerfields ] where every line is a messenger pair which receives a mass larger than the gut scale so that they can be integrated out to give the desired effective operators . to simplify the notation before we have introduced the messenger scale @xmath98 as shorthand which is related to the individual messenger masses with order one coefficients .",
    "note that in the superpotential bilinear in the fields no @xmath107-term for the higgs fields appears .",
    "this term is forbidden by symmetries and in combination with a nmssm like mechanism helps to increase the higgs mass to the experimentally determined value . a possible singlet field",
    "@xmath108 with couplings @xmath109 would not appear anywhere else in the superpotential with the symmetries and field content as specified in tables   [ tab : matter+higgsfields ] , [ tab : flavonfields ] , [ tab : drivingfields ] and [ tab : messengerfields ] .",
    "the next step in our discussion of the renormalizable superpotential is the flavon sector .",
    "the full potential for this sector reads ( dropping for the sake of simplicity order one coefficients ) @xmath110 the first three lines of this superpotential have already been discussed in the flavon alignment section  [ sec : flavon ] while the last four lines are needed to fix the phases of the various flavon vevs .",
    "for instance , the messenger pair @xmath111 and @xmath112 gives after integrating out the effective operator @xmath113 where in this case @xmath98 stands for @xmath114 multiplied by real order one couplings .",
    "this operator fixes the phase of @xmath115 up to a discrete choice as discussed before .",
    "we will not list here all of the effective operators because they have already appeared in our superpotential for the flavon alignment and they can also be read off from the diagrams in figure  [ fig : flavonmessenger ] after contracting the messenger propagators to points .          for the renormalizable couplings including the matter and higgs fields we find the renormalizable superpotential ( again dropping order one coefficients ) @xmath116 after integrating out the heavy messenger fields we end up with the non - renormalizable operators as discussed in section  [ sec : model ] , cf .",
    "also figures  [ fig : downmessenger]-[fig : neutrinomessenger ] .",
    "in addition to the renormalizable operators discussed so far there are six more operators allowed by the symmetries which are @xmath117 the first two operators contribute effectively to the @xmath118 operator already present and for the sake of simplicity we have not shown them in figure  [ fig : upmessenger ] .",
    "the third operator generates the dimension six operator @xmath119 which gives a contribution to the 2 - 2 element of the down - type quark and charged lepton yukawa matrix .",
    "in fact the correction has the same phase and the same @xmath52 clebsch  gordan coefficient as the leading order coefficient so that we can safely neglect it .",
    "the last three operators finally give , after integrating out the heavy messengers , dimension seven and eight operators which give only small corrections ( in our model we have discussed operators up to dimension six ) . the dimension seven operators , for instance , are induced by @xmath120 which gives corrections to the @xmath121 and @xmath122 elements of the up - type quark yukawa matrix which are very small compared to all other elements which are generated at maximum by a dimension five operator .",

    "<S> we revisit a two right - handed neutrino model with two texture zeros , namely an indirect model based on @xmath0 with the recently proposed new type of constrained sequential dominance ( csd2 ) , involving vacuum alignments along the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions in flavour space , which are proportional to the neutrino dirac mass matrix columns . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we construct a renormalizable and unified indirect @xmath3 model along these lines and show that , with spontaneous cp violation and a suitable vacuum alignment of the phases , the charged lepton corrections lead to a reactor angle in good agreement with results from daya bay and reno . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts a right - angled unitarity triangle in the quark sector and a dirac cp violating oscillation phase in the lepton sector of @xmath4 , while providing a good fit to all quark and lepton masses and mixing angles .    </S>",
