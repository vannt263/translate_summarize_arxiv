    "the brazilian antenna is made of cu - al ( 94@xmath0 - 6@xmath0 ) , it has a diameter of 65 cm and covers the 3.0 - 3.4 khz bandwidth using a two - mode parametric transducer ( see , aguiar 2002 , 2004 for details ) .",
    "the initial target is a sensitivity of @xmath1 in a 50 hz bandwidth , which we believe is reachable at 4.2 k with conservative parameters .",
    "an advanced sensitivity will be pursued later , cooling the antenna to 15 mk and improving all parameters ( see frajuca 2004 ) .",
    "the brazilian antenna will operate in conjunction with the dutch mini - grail antenna , and the laser interferometer detectors , which can also cover such high frequencies with similar sensitivities .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the event rates for the two spherical antennas will be the same , as long as they have the same sensitivity .",
    "so , throughout the paper , when we refer to the sources and the event rates to the schenberg antenna , the reader has to bear in mind that we are also refereing to the the dutch mini - grail antenna .    in a previous work by a m.sc .",
    "student of our group ( castro 2003 ) , a preliminary study of the most probable sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) was conducted that could be detected by schenberg , namely : core collapse in supernova events ; ( proto)neutron stars undergoing hydrodynamical instability ; f - mode unstable neutron stars , caused by quakes and oscillations ; excitation of the first quadrupole normal mode of @xmath2 black holes ; coalescence of neutron stars and/or black holes ; exotic sources such as bosonic or strange matter stars rotating at 1.6 khz ; and inspiralling of mini black hole binaries .    our aim here is to present the results of this study and to revisit the @xmath3mode unstable neutron star source of gws .",
    "this specific pulsation mode is one of the most important channel for the emission of gws ( kokkotas and andersson 2001 ) by neutron stars .",
    "in particular , we are using recent results for the radial distribution of pulsars in the galaxy ( yusifov and kk 2004 ) in order to determine the event rate detectable by schenberg for a given efficiency of generation of gws .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly consider the sources detectable by the schenberg antenna , in section 3 we revisit the f - mode neutron star gw detectability by the schenberg antenna , and finally in section 4 we present our conclusions .",
    "first of all , it is worth mentioning that in the present estimates of event rates we are assuming that the schenberg s sensitivity to burst sources is of @xmath4 , which seems reasonable from our projected @xmath5 and bandwidth .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that such a sensitivity is not the quantum limit one , which could be a factor around 5 better . also , it is worth remembering that using the  squeezing technique \" the quantum limit could in principle be overtaken .",
    "all this would imply that schenberg , which will be using parametric transducers , could in principle present event rates significantly greater than those presented here ; in some cases , the rates could well be higher by a factor of up to @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth stressing that the brazilian detector will be sensitive to sources of the local group of galaxies ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "although , just the galaxy , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can give a significant contribution to the event rates , because these three galaxies account for more than @xmath10 of the mass of the local group .",
    "our estimates show that , except for the mini black hole binaries and the f - mode unstable neutron stars , the other putative sources to schenberg present event rates of at most one event every @xmath11 10 years , at a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) equal to unity .",
    "thus , the prospect for the detection of these sources is not very promising . because of this we do not enter into details of such estimates .",
    "for the mini black hole binaries we refer the reader to the paper by de araujo ( 2004 ) for details .",
    "they show that the event rate in this case may be of one event every 5 years , at snr equal to unity .",
    "our main aim in the present paper is to pay attention to the f - mode unstable neutron star , which can in principle be an important source to the schenberg antenna . in our previous study",
    "we show that one such an event every year would be detectable by schenberg at a snr equal to unity .    in the next section",
    "we revisit the f - mode unstable neutron star study concerning its detectability in particular by the schenberg antenna .",
    "before studying the f - mode unstable neutron star as a source of gws to the brazilian antenna , which is of major interest here , it is worth considering its relevance as compared to the other pulsation modes such stars could have in what concern the generation of gws .",
    "relativistic stars are known to have a host of pulsation modes . only a few of them , however , is of relevance for gw detection . from the gw point of view",
    "the most important modes are the fundamental ( f ) mode of fluid oscillation , the first few pressure ( p ) modes and the first gw ( w ) mode ( kokkotas and schutz 1992 ) . among these three modes",
    "the pulsation energy is mostly stored in the f - mode in which the fluid parameters undergo the largest changes .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the r - mode can also be , under certain circumstances , a very important source of gws ( andersson 2001 ) .",
    "an important question is how the modes are excited in the neutron stars , which are of our concern here .",
    "there are many scenarios that could lead to significant asymmetries .",
    "a supernova explosions are expected to form a wildly pulsating neutron star that emits gws . a pessimistic estimate for the energy radiated as gws indicates a total release equivalent to @xmath12 .",
    "an optimistic estimates , where the neutron star is formed , for example , from strongly non - spherical collapse , suggest a release equivalent to @xmath13 .",
    "another possible excitation mechanism for neutron star pulsation is a starquake , which can be associated with a pulsar glitch .",
    "the energy released in this process may be of the order of the maximum mechanical energy stored in the crust of the neutron stars , which is estimated to be of @xmath14 ( blaes 1989 ; mock and joss 1998 ) .    during the coalescence of two",
    "neutron stars several oscillation modes could in principle be generated .",
    "stellar oscillations being excited by the tidal fields of the two stars , for example .",
    "the neutron star may undergo a phase transition leading to a mini - collapse , which could lead to a sudden contraction during which part of the gravitational binding energy of the star would be released , and , as a result , it could occur that part of this energy would be channelled into pulsations of the remnant .",
    "similarly , the transformation of a neutron star into a strange star is likely to induce pulsations .    in our previous study",
    "we have found that schenberg could in principle detect at least one such a source per year at snr equal to unity .",
    "the basic assumptions in this study are the following .",
    "firstly , we have taken into account in our estimate only the known pulsars .",
    "secondly , we have assumed that the energy release in gws is of the order of @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , andersson and kokkotas 1996 ) .",
    "thirdly , we have associated the f - mode excitation with the same mechanism responsible to the glitch phenomenon , which is related to some neutron star internal structure rearrangement ( see , e.g. , horvath 2004 ) .",
    "last but not least , we have assumed that the f - mode instability may produce gws in the frequency band of @xmath16 khz , that of schenberg s .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper by kokkotas and andersson ( 2001 ) , in particular its figure 2 , where it is shown clearly that for a family of equations of state ( eoss ) gws of @xmath17 khz may be produced by f - mode unstable neutron stars .",
    "it is worth recalling that gws produced in the f - mode excitation depends on the eos for the neutron star matter that , as is well known , is not completely established .    before considering the improvements we intend to take into account in revisiting this study , it is worth recalling that the characteristic amplitude of gws related to the f - mode instability is given by @xmath18 ( see , e.g. , andersson and kokkotas 1998 ) where @xmath19 is the efficiency of generation of gws",
    ", @xmath20 is the gw frequency , and @xmath21 is the distance to the source .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the f - mode is a burst source of gws with a duration of tenths of a second ( see , e.g. , andersson and kokkotas 1998 ) .",
    "this signal being concentrated in a bandwidth which is completely within the schenberg s bandwidth . as a result in the calculation of the snr",
    "it is a good approximation to compare directly the detector pulse sensitivity with the predicted wave amplitude of the f - mode gw .",
    "the schenberg s sensitivity for burst sources can be of the order of @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that , for @xmath23 and @xmath243 khz , schenberg can in principle detect f - mode unstable neutron star sources at distances of up to @xmath25 kpc at @xmath26 .",
    "certainly , the number of neutron stars within the volume _ seen _ by schenberg could be in principle enormous . unless the efficiency of generation of gws through f - mode instability is @xmath27 or such a mode is not excited at all , schenberg could in principle detect f - mode unstable neutron stars with a considerable event rate .",
    "in this study the main ingredient we have taken into account is the distribution function of pulsars in the galaxy .",
    "one could consider , however , that it would be desirable to take into account , instead , a distribution function for the neutron stars in the galaxy , because the pulsar population is a tiny part ( say 0.1 - 0.01% ; later on we explain how these figures are obtained ) of the neutron star population .",
    "but , one has to bear in mind that most of the observed neutron stars is in fact seen in the form of pulsars .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if the f - mode instability occurs in any neutron star , being it a pulsar or not , the event rate seen by any gw detector sensitive to its frequency could be strongly enhanced .",
    "the distribution function for the pulsars in the galaxy has been studied in many papers ( see , e.g. , narayan 1987 , paczynski 1990 , hartman 1997 ; lyne 1998 ; schwarz and seidel 2002 , among others ) .",
    "we here adopt the distribution function recently obtained by yusifov and kk ( 2004 ) , namely , @xmath28 } \\label{gam14 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the surface density of pulsars , @xmath30 is galactocentric distance , @xmath31 kpc is the sun@xmath32galactic center ( gc ) distance .",
    "note that , the equation ( [ gam14 ] ) implies that @xmath33 , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "to avoid such a problem the authors include an additional parameter @xmath34 and used a shifted gamma function , replacing @xmath30 and @xmath35 in equation  ( [ gam14 ] ) by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the best fit , using the lms method gives : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 kpc .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper by yusifov and kk ( 2004 ) for further details .    in figure 1",
    "we present the number of pulsars as a function of the distance from the sun , which has been obtained through integration of equation  ( [ gam14 ] ) .",
    "also present is the number of pulsars corrected by the beaming factor , which multiples that number by a factor of approximately 10 ( see , e.g. , tauris and manchester 1998 ) .    the number of pulsars that could be seen by schenberg amount @xmath41 ( taking into account the beaming correction ) . in the whole galaxy the number of pulsars with luminosity greater than 0.1  mjy @xmath42 at 1400mhz is predicted to be of @xmath43 , taking into account the beaming factor .",
    "again , we refer the reader to the paper by yusifov and kk ( 2004 ) for further details .",
    "now , from the available catalogs at that time , castro ( 2003 ) obtained that only @xmath44 of the known pulsars present glitch phenomenon .",
    "the number of glitches in 25 years amounting to 45 . from castro",
    "we obtain that the number of glitches per year per pulsars amount to @xmath45 .",
    "since we are considering the fact that the f - mode is capable of being excited during the glitch phenomenon we have : @xmath46 finally , to obtain the number of events per year , detectable by schenberg , we use the results presented in figure 1 .    since the efficiency of generation of gw through f - mode channel is not known , we present in figure 2 the event rate detectable by schenberg as a function of @xmath19 . note that for @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) we predict that one f - mode source could in principle be detected at @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) every year .",
    "it is worth noting that the number of pulsars used in the calculation of figure 2 takes into account the beaming correction .    , the efficiency of generation of gws , detectable by schenberg at @xmath49 and @xmath51 , assuming that the schenberg s sensitivity to burst sources is of @xmath4.,width=226 ]    note that the event rate is critically dependent on the value of @xmath19 . in figure 2",
    "one sees that if this parameter is too small the event rate is very small too .",
    "however , the prediction appearing in figure 2 takes into account only the neutron stars in the form of pulsars with luminosity greater than 0.1  mjy @xmath42 at 1400mhz .",
    "the number of neutron stars in the galaxy , pulsars or not , could well be a factor of a thousand , or even tens of a thousand , greater .",
    "paczynski ( 1990 ) , for example , estimates that there may exist @xmath52 neutron stars in the galaxy .",
    "other authors find similar figures , namely : nelson ( 1995 ) and walter ( 2001 ) argue that there may exit @xmath53 neutron stars in the galaxy ; whereas , timmes ( 1996 ) , using models for massive stellar evolution coupled to a model for galactic chemical evolution , obtained @xmath52 neutron stars in the galaxy .",
    "if the non pulsar neutron stars could also be f - mode unstable , this means that the event rate detectable by schenberg could be greatly enhanced .",
    "in particular , if the fraction of neutron stars and the fraction of pulsars , which are f - mode unstable , are similar this means that the event rate that could be detected by schenberg would be a thousands , or even a few thousands , greater .    if this is the case , even though @xmath54 , schenberg could detect @xmath55 events every year at @xmath50 .",
    "particular attention has been given here to the f - mode sources , because it can in principle be one of the most important candidates to be detected by the schenberg antenna , with an event rate that could amount to several sources every year .",
    "since the interferometers are also sensitive to the gws generated by f - mode neutron stars , it would be of interest to search for this sources with such detectors . due to the fact that the sensitivity of the interferometers at 3 khz ( see , e.g. , shoemaker 2005 ) could well be similar to that of the schenberg antenna",
    ", the event rate of both detectors could be similar .      finally , it is worth mentioning that kokkotas ( 2001 ) show that detecting the f - mode , the eos , the mass and the radius of the neutron stars will be strongly constrained .",
    "the reader should appreciate the reading of this paper by kokkotas , who show in detail how these above mentioned astrophysical information is obtained from the gw data ."
