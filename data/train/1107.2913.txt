    "the modification of the @xmath0 meson properties ( masses and widths ) in hot , dense matter has consequences for scenarios of @xmath4 suppression , e.g. , by the processes of the type @xmath5 which couple hidden charm to open charm states and thus lead to a dissociation of charm in the medium @xcite , see refs .",
    "@xcite for early controversial estimates of the cross sections of such processes .",
    "the reverse process @xcite of charmonium regeneration by open charm recombination should play a dominant role for @xmath4 production at lhc @xcite where charm is abundant in the medium .    since either dropping masses @xcite or increasing widths @xcite of the @xmath0 mesons in a hot and dense medium can lead to a lowering of the reaction threshold and thus to a strong increase of the rate for the processes ( [ flip ] )",
    ", both effects may contribute to an explanation of the anomalous @xmath4 suppression found in the na50 experiment @xcite and subsequently confirmed by na60 @xcite and phenix @xcite .",
    "for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "in contrast to results from a relativistic mean - field model of @xmath0 mesons in nuclear matter which predicts a strong downwards shift of @xmath1 meson masses due to the renormalization with a scalar mean field @xcite , the consideration of the quark substructure of these mesons leads to qualitatively different behavior . as we will show in this work on the basis of a chiral quark model of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) type and its polyakov - loop extension ( pnjl ) ,",
    "the pauli blocking effect in the bethe - salpeter equation for the @xmath0-mesons largely compensates the dropping masses of their quark constituents . as a result ,",
    "@xmath0-meson masses do not drop but stay almost constant or rather increase with increasing density ( and temperature ) of the matter .",
    "their decay width , however , increases rapidly and reaches values which allow for a subthreshold quark rearrangement dissociation of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , scenarios for @xmath4 suppression built on the quark rearrangement reaction ( [ flip ] ) have to be reconsidered . as has been demonstrated in @xcite , a sufficient width of @xmath0 mesonic correlations in the quark plasma is essential for understanding charm thermalisation and diffusion in rhic experiments , see @xcite for a review .",
    "it is interesting to note that a recent self - consistent coupled channel approach for @xmath0 mesons in hot , dense nuclear matter @xcite supports the picture of a spectral broadening with a negligible mass shift up to temperatures @xmath6 mev and densities @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xmath9 being the nucleon density of nuclear matter at saturation .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that a quark hadron duality similar to that discussed for low - mass dilepton production @xcite can be observed also in the @xmath0 meson channel at the deconfinement transition .",
    "the spectral broadening of @xmath0 mesons rather than their mass shift has been suggested for an explanation of anomalous @xmath4 suppression in @xcite .",
    "this question , however , awaits a thorough investigation .    in the present note",
    ", we investigate the extension of previous exploratory calculations of @xmath0 mesonic correlations in quark matter , based on the njl model @xcite to the domain of finite baryon densities which will become accessible in the cbm experiment at fair .",
    "of particular interest will be the question whether the suggested mass splitting of @xmath0 meson states @xcite will be observable or rather washed out by spectral broadening .",
    "furthermore , a strong isospin dependence of the @xmath0 meson broadening could result in observable signatures , possibly relevant for quark - gluon plasma diagnostics .",
    "chiral dynamics has been applied successfully not only in the light quark sector but also especially for the investigation of heavy - light pseudoscalar meson properties .",
    "this has been most impressively demonstrated within the dyson - schwinger equation approach in ref .",
    "@xcite which reproduced a complete set of heavy meson observables .",
    "a particular feature of these systems is the heavy quark symmetry which allows to separate the physics of the heavy and the light quark components from each other and absorb the chiral dynamics of the latter into the universal isgur - wise function @xcite . for more details ,",
    "see the reviews on heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that already the chiral dynamics encoded in the rather schematic njl model reproduces features like heavy - quark symmetry and isgur - wise function @xcite when extended to the heavy quark sector .",
    "these properties remain unaffected when confining properties are mimicked in the heavy - quark extended njl model by an infrared cutoff procedure @xcite or by a confining interquark potential in a relativistic potential model of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 meson properties as reported in our study come from a simultaneous solution of two types of nonperturbative equations : the gap equations for the quark masses and the bethe - salpeter equations for the meson masses .",
    "the results for the dependence of pseudoscalar meson masses @xmath10 on the current quark masses @xmath11 of the heavier quark in the meson nicely reproduce the transition from a gell - mann  oakes  renner like behaviour for pion and kaon ( @xmath12 ) to the additive quark model like behaviour ( @xmath13 ) for @xmath0 and @xmath14 mesons .",
    "these results are then readily generalized from the vacuum to finite temperature and chemical potential within the matsubara formalism .",

    "the chiral restoration is a result of the phase space occupation ( pauli blocking ) which effectively reduces the interaction strength in the gap equation .",
    "navely , one would expect that heavy - light mesons such as @xmath89 mesons , should suffer a mass reduction when embedded in a hot and dense medium , as a result of the strong reduction of the light quark constituent mass ( the charm quark mass is approximately unaffected ) .",
    "the solution of the in - medium @xmath2 meson bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , however , shows a different result , displayed in figs .",
    "[ dmesons - tmu],[dmesons - t3mu ] for the njl case .",
    "this can be understood from inspecting the kernel of the bse : the mass shift of the light quarks , which affects the energy denominators and would lead to a lowering of the meson masses , when evaluated in free space , gets compensated or even overcompensated by the pauli blocking factor in the numerator .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 mesons containing a light quark , as the dominant quark species in a dense medium , feel a stronger pauli blockig than those containing light antiquarks .",

    "[ dmesons - t3mu ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    there is an important consequence of this fact that the heavy - light continuum threshold is lowered while the bound state masses are not : at a critical density the bound states merge the continuum ( mott effect ) and become unstable against decay into their quark constituents , as signalled by the nonvanishing decay widths shown in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ dmesons - tmu ] , [ dmesons - t3mu ] .",
    "the stronger pauli blocking for the @xmath2 mesons leads not only to a lower mott density , but also to a larger decay width as compared to the @xmath1 .",
    "from these figures one can also read off the critical densities where the phenomenon of @xmath0 meson mott effect could be expected for the njl model .    in figs .",
    "[ dmu_njl],[dmu_pnjl ] we present results as a function of the quark chemical potential in isospin symmetric matter for the njl model and its extension with coupling to the polyakov loop .",
    "the results are rather similar , except for the smaller width of the transition region in the pnjl case and the different position of the critical point in the phase diagram .",

    "@xcite , where a lowering of the @xmath0 meson mass had been conjectured with consequences for charmonium dissociation in heavy - ion collision experiments . in this reference",
    "the pauli blocking effect was neglected .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pauli blocking effect occurs not only on the quark level but also on the hadronic level of description , when coupled channel equations for @xmath0 mesons in nuclear matter are solved selfconsistently as , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite . also in this approach the @xmath0 meson mass remains almost unshifted while a considerable spectral broadening is obtained under similar conditions of density and temperature as considered in the present work .",
    "in the isospin - symmetric quark matter case holds @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons containing light quarks ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) suffer a positive mass shift due to the effective reduction of the coupling by pauli blocking , since the phase space is occupied by light quarks abundant in the medium .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons composed of light antiquarks ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) suffer no pauli shift since there are no antiquarks in the medium .",
    "their mass at the mott transition density is approximately the same as in vacuum .",
    "it is interesting to compare the decay widths of the @xmath0 mesons into their quark constituents . due to the repulsive pauli shift ,",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath98 are clearly above the threshold already at the first order chiral phase transition and have a non - negligible decay width , whereas the @xmath1 and @xmath99 mesons are still very good resonances with negligible decay width at the transition .",
    "the effect of coupling the chiral quark model to the polyakov loop in the pnjl model is an effective suppression of the quark distribution functions in the bse ( [ bse1]),([bse2 ] ) as long as @xmath100 which leads to a narrowing @xcite of the chiral transition region where medium effects on the d meson properties occur in the present model . in this region",
    "the dissociation of d mesons ( mott effect ) occurs and is signalled by an increase in the spectral width of these states .    summarizing the results of this model",
    ", we find no support for dropping @xmath0 meson masses in the vicinity of the chiral / deconfinement phase transition in hot and dense matter but rather a strong spectral broadening .",
    "therefore , scenarios of @xmath4 suppression in dense matter via dissociation processes like ( [ flip ] ) , which are built on increasing widths @xcite for the @xmath0 mesons should be conceptually preferable over those built on dropping masses .",

    "<S> contrary to results from hadronic mean - field theories , the chiral quark model does not support the scenario of a dropping @xmath0-meson masses so that scenarios for @xmath4 dissociation by quark rearrangement built on the lowering of the threshold for this process in a hot and dense medium have to be reconsidered and should account for the spectral broadening . </S>"
