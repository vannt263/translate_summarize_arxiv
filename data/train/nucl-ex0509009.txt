    "lattice quantum chromodynamic calculations predict a new state of matter of deconfined quark and gluons ( quark gluon plasma , qgp ) at an energy density exceeding @xmath4  1 gev/@xmath5  @xcite",
    ". nuclear matter at high energy density has been extensively studied through ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions ( for recent developements , see reference  @xcite ) . within the experimental programme with heavy - ion beams at cern sps",
    ", na57 is a dedicated experiment for the study of the production of strange and multi - strange particles in pb - pb collisions at mid - rapidity  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of strange particle production provides one of the most powerful tools to study the dynamics of the reaction .",
    "in particular , an enhanced production of strange particles in nucleus  nucleus collisions with respect to proton ",
    "induced reactions was suggested long ago as a possible signature of the phase transition from colour confined hadronic matter to a qgp  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is expected to increase with the strangeness content of the hyperon .",
    "these features were first observed by the wa97 experiment  @xcite and subsequently confirmed and studied in more detail by the na57 experiment  @xcite .",
    "other insights into the reaction dynamics have been inferred from the @xmath6  distributions of the strange particles : the study of the transverse expansion of the collision and the @xmath6  dependence of the nuclear modification factors have been presented , respectively , in reference  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "rapidity distributions provide a tool to study the longitudinal dynamics ; e.g. , differences between protons and anti - protons have been interpreted as a consequence of the nuclear stopping  @xcite . if hyperons , like protons , keep a ` memory ' of the initial baryon density , then the _ relative _ pattern for the rapidity distribution of hyperons and anti - hyperons should resemble that of protons and anti - protons  @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical properties of the expanding matter created in heavy ion reactions have been discussed by landau  @xcite and bjorken  @xcite in theoretical pictures using different initial conditions . in both scenarios , thermal equilibrium",
    "is quickly achieved and the subsequent isentropic expansion is governed by hydrodynamics .",
    "the na57 experiment has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the analysis of the pb - pb data sample collected at 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3 ( 460 m events ) ; the sample analyzed here corresponds to the most central 53% of the inelastic pb - pb cross - section .",
    "the data have been divided into five centrality classes , labelled as 0,1,2,3 and 4 from the most peripheral to the most central , according to the value of the charged particle multiplicity sampled at central rapidity by a dedicated silicon microstrip detector .",
    "the procedure to measure the multiplicity distribution and to determine the centrality of the collision for each class is described in reference  @xcite .",
    "the fractions of the inelastic cross - section for each of the five classes , determined assuming an inelastic pb - pb cross - section of 7.26 barn ( as calculated with the glauber model ) , are given in table  [ tab : centrality ] .",
    ".centrality ranges for the five classes .",
    "[ tab : centrality ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in landau hydrodynamics , the amount of entropy ( @xmath7 ) contained within a ( fluid ) rapidity @xmath8   is given by  @xcite @xmath9    \\left [ i_0(q ) - \\frac{\\beta\\omega_f}{q}i_1(q )   \\right ] \\label{eq : landau}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12  is the velocity of sound in the medium , @xmath13  is the initial temperature , @xmath14  is the rapidity , @xmath15  is the radius of the nuclei , @xmath16  is the initial length , @xmath17  is the initial entropy density , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20   are bessel functions .",
    "the quantity @xmath21  is used to normalize the spectra at mid - rapidity .",
    "the particle rapidity distribution is obtained , as for the bjorken case , as a superpositon of the multiplicity density in rapidity space ( @xmath22 ) with a thermal distribution of the fluid elements , @xmath23    in the landau model the width of the rapidity distribution is sensitive to the velocity of sound and to the ratio of the freeze - out temparature to the initial temperature .",
    "while integrating over @xmath14  in equation  [ eq : bjorken2 ] , the range of @xmath14  is treated as a parameter in case of bjorken hydrodynamics ; moreover in the bjorken case ( equation  [ eq : bjorken2 ] ) the factor @xmath24 , which appears in equation  [ eq : landau2 ] , has been included in the overall normalization factor @xmath2   since the entropy density @xmath25  is independent of the rapidity , in accordance with the assumption of boost invariance along the longitudinal direction  @xcite . in the case of landau hydrodynamics , the integration limit is fixed by @xmath26   and the multiplicity density in @xmath14  space ( @xmath24 ) is written explicitly in the @xmath14  integration ( equation  [ eq : landau2 ] ) .",
    "landau hydrodynamics can also reproduce simultaneously the distributions for all the strange particles considered ( @xmath27 28/32 ) but we are not able to put stringent constraints on both the velocity of sound and the ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the confidence level contours in the @xmath29  vs. @xmath30   parameter space are shown in figure  [ fig : landau ] .",
    "for instance , the hypothesys of a perfect gas ( i.e. @xmath31 ) would result ( at the 3@xmath32  confidence level ) in either @xmath33  or @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , two physical regions are constrained at the 3@xmath32  confidence level , the first located at small values of @xmath28  and the second between 0.5 and 0.8 ; on the other hand , the region at @xmath35  is unphysical .",
    "both physical regions span over the full range @xmath36 .",
    "we have measured the @xmath37  distributions of high purity samples of , , @xmath0  and @xmath1  particles produced at central rapidity in pb - pb collisions at 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3  over a wide centrality range of collision ( i.e. the most central 53% of the pb - pb inelastic cross - section ) . in the unit of rapidity around mid - rapidity covered by na57 , we have performed fits to the @xmath37  distributions of  and  using a gaussian parameterization : the resulting widths are compatible with each other and constant as a function of centrality .",
    "contrary to , the  spectra are flat to good accurancy in the range of rapidity and centrality considered ; this would indicate that the  hyperon conserves `` memory '' of the initial baryon density .",
    "the rapidity distributions of the @xmath1  particle are found to be flat within the errors in one unit of rapidity for central ( 0 - 11% ) and peripheral ( 23 - 53% ) collisions .",
    "boost - invariant bjorken hydrodynamics can describe simultaneously the rapidity spectra of all the strange particles under study with @xmath38 , yielding an average longitudinal flow velocity @xmath39 , sligthly larger than the measured transverse flow .",
    "isotropic _ collective expansion of the system suggests large nuclear stopping . a fairly good description is also provided by landau hydrodynamics , which allows us to put constraints in the parameter space of the velocity of sound in the medium and the ratio of the freeze - out temperature to the initial temperature .",
