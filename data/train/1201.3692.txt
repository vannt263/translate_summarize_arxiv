    "in large - scale ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) diagrams of hi 21-cm line emission in the galactic plane , there are many small , faint , high - velocity  wing - like \" features extending to velocities well beyond the maximum or minimum permitted by galactic rotation @xcite .",
    "these  forbidden velocity wings ( fvws ) \" are likely due to energetic phenomena in the galaxy , as they are confined to small areas ( @xmath7 ) , and project smoothly beyond the general galactic emission to high velocities .",
    "@xcite suggested that some of these fvws may represent the expanding shells of  missing \" supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which are not included in existing snr catalogs .",
    "the basic idea is that old snrs are faint in the radio continuum , making it difficult to identify them because of both the confusion due to the galactic background emission , and observational limitations ( e.g. , brogan et al .",
    "@xcite considered the fact that an old snr should possess a fast - expanding hi shell that will still be present as a coherent entity after the remnant becomes too faint to be visible in the radio continuum .",
    "if its expansion velocity is greater than the minimum or maximum velocities permitted by galactic rotation , then an old snr shell , or part of it ( maybe the caps ) , could be detected as high - velocity hi gas , e.g. , fvws .",
    "indeed , @xcite have carried out high - resolution hi line observations toward one fvw and detected a rapidly expanding ( 80 km s@xmath4 ) hi shell , the parameters of which are consistent with those of the remnant of a sn that exploded some 0.3  myr ago .",
    "recently , @xcite identified 87 fvws from the leiden / dwingeloo hi survey ( lds ; * ? ? ? * ) and the southern galactic plane survey data ( sgps ; * ? ? ? * ) . among these",
    ", 6 fvws are found to be coincident with snrs , 4 with nearby galaxies , and 3 with high - velocity clouds .",
    "the rest ( 85% ) are not associated with any obvious objects that could be responsible for their high velocities .",
    "we have since been making follow - up high - resolution hi observations of these fvws of unknown nature using the arecibo 305-m and green bank 100-m radio telescopes in order to identify their natures and origins , and have now observed @xmath8% of them .",
    "we find that about 40% of the observed fvws have shell - like morphologies .",
    "more than half of these are apparently expanding at @xmath9  km s@xmath4 , which supports the possibility of some fvws being old snrs .",
    "the other 60% show irregular structures consisting of filaments and clumps .",
    "most of these show faint bumps in their line profiles indicating high - velocity hi clouds .",
    "they might correspond to the fast - moving , compact clouds in the disk , or in the disk - halo interface , that have been recently detected in sensitive , high - resolution hi surveys ( * ? ? ?",

    "the frequency pairs that include 325 mhz result in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , consistent with non - thermal emission , while the pairs that include 408 mhz yield @xmath52 and @xmath53 , compatible with thermal emission .",
    "these trends are consistent with the plot of the total flux densities ( fig .",

    "as mentioned at the beginning of this section , previous studies claimed that the radio emission from some of these filaments is of thermal origin .",
    "however , our analysis in this section indicates the presence of a non - thermal component in filament a. the fact that the spectral index of s232 , as derived from the same data , is consistent with optically - thin thermal emission supports our result .",

    "this is consistent with the emission being associated with g173 + 1.5 because if we adopt @xmath57 mag ( or @xmath58 @xmath59 ) corresponding to the extinction to s234 @xcite as the extinction to g173 + 1.5 , the transmission of 1/4 kev photons is essentially zero ( @xmath60% ) while it is 40% and 80% at 3/4 and 1.5 kev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the emission is not uniform and the ratio of 1.5 to 3/4 kev intensities vary over the field .",
    "note that , since the contributions from point sources have been removed from the map , the emission is from diffuse sources , although some compact sources might have been included , e.g. , the bright spot near s234 .",

    "the ratio of 1.5 kev to 3/4 kev is @xmath64 . using the model of @xcite , the ratio corresponds to either a power - law photon spectrum ( @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is energy ) of index @xmath67 or thermal spectrum with temperature of @xmath68  k for @xmath58 @xmath59 . the power - law index",
    "@xmath69 is considerably steeper than that of a pulsar wind nebula , e.g. , @xmath70 for the crab nebula , so that we may rule out a non - thermal origin .",

    "we assume that the gas density within the shell is constant . for the radial profile of expansion velocity within the shell ,",
    "we consider two different cases .",
    "the first is that the expansion velocity is constant with radius .",
    "the second is that the expansion velocity varies linearly with radius .",
    "linearly decreasing or increasing velocity structures within the shell are derived by theoretical studies for different ages of radiative shells @xcite . here , we choose a velocity structure for which the expansion velocity at the outer radius drops to 50% of that at the inner radius .    to fit the derived mass distribution , we adopt a three dimensional cube composed of 451@xmath107 pixels .",
    "the @xmath108 axis is along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the number density of hi atoms for a pixel centered at @xmath109 is @xmath110 , which is assumed to be constant in our model .",
    "this pixel has an los velocity @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the radial expansion velocity at @xmath113 .",
    "the hi 21-cm emission line from this pixel has a gaussian distribution with the los velocity dispersion of @xmath106 ( = 5.5  km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "then the column density , @xmath114 , at @xmath115 over the lsr velocity interval from @xmath6 to @xmath116 and the hi mass , @xmath117 , between @xmath6 and @xmath116 , are given as follows : @xmath118 dv^\\prime dz,\\ ] ] @xmath119    the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fg11 ] is the best fit for the mass distribution of a shell with a constant expansion velocity profile . here , the only fitting parameter is the density of the shell .",
    "the velocity range , where the mass of the observed hi shell smoothly decreases , is wider than the velocity range due to velocity dispersion , so the observed hi mass distribution can not be explained by velocity dispersion alone .",
    "the dashed line shows the best fit for the mass distribution of a shell with an expansion velocity profile linearly decreasing towards larger radii .",
    "this dashed line fits the observed mass better than the dotted line .",
    "variation of the expansion velocity with radius dilutes the rectangular mass distribution at high velocities , but still yields a constant mass distribution at lower velocities , from @xmath15 @xmath120 to @xmath121  km s@xmath4 .",
    "note that the basic shape of the mass profile is determined by the difference between the minimum and maximum expansion velocities .",
    "the detailed velocity and density structures only affect the shape of the decreasing portion of the mass profile .",
    "we will study the mass profiles resulting from various velocity and density structures in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the estimated total hi mass of the shell adopting a linearly decreasing velocity profile is 5900@xmath122m@xmath102 .",
    "we will use this value as the characteristic mass of the shell . note that the total mass derived from the gaussian fit is about twice this .",
    "the kinetic energy of the shell , taking into account the he abundance of 10% by number , is @xmath123 ergs .",
    "the derived physical parameters of the model hi /continuum shell are presented in table  [ tbhi ] .",
    "we can think of two possibilites for the origin of fvw172.8 + 1.5 ; stellar winds from ob stars or sn explosions .",
    "hii regions can also produce expanding hi shells , but their expansion velocities and energies are much smaller than those of fvw 172.8 + 1.5 .",
    "furthermore , the hii  regions are mostly located at the boundary of the structure , so that they do not appear to be major sources of the @xmath124@xmath125-sized shell .",
    "we first consider whether the stellar winds from ob stars can produce fvw172.8 + 1.5 .",
    "there are more than a dozen o stars in this area @xcite with eight of them projected against the shell ( figs . 5 and 9 ) .",
    "we summarize the parameters of these stars in table 6 .",
    "their spectral types range from o9.5 to o7 , and four are associated with the sharpless hii regions .",
    "the other four could be possible candidates for the origin of the hi / continuum shell .",
    "if we use the relation of @xcite and a wind speed of @xmath126 km s@xmath4 , then the typical wind luminosities of o7o9 main - sequence stars are ( 50.8)@xmath127 erg s@xmath4 . for giant o stars , this would be larger by a factor of two .",
    "however , the required wind luminosity to explain the parameters of the shell is @xmath128 erg s@xmath4 @xcite , which is two orders of magnitude greater than the available wind luminosities . even if there are groups of stars in this area ( see next section ) , their contribution to the wind luminosity will not be significant because they are no brighter than o9 .",
    "we thus consider that fvw172.8 + 1.5 is likely to be the result of an sn explosion .",
    "certainly , the derived parameters are fully consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the required sn explosion energy is @xmath129  ergs , where @xmath130 is the ambient h density in @xmath80 , @xmath131 is the radius of the shell in pc , @xmath132 is the expansion velocity in km s@xmath4 , and @xmath133 is the metalicity in units of the solar metalicity @xcite . for the above parameters , @xmath134 ergs , where the solar metalicity has been adopted .",
    "this value of @xmath135 is close to the canonical outburst energy of a single sn explosion of @xmath136 ergs .",
    "the age of the shell , assuming this to be in the radiative stage of snr evolution , is @xmath137 = 0.3 @xmath138 = 0.33 myr .",
    "the snr interpretation is also consistent with the presence of x - rays in this region .",
    "the thermal energy of the x - ray emitting gas @xmath139  ergs , which is 25% of the initial explosion energy and close to that expected for a 0.33 myr - old radiative snr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the apparent segregation between the fast - moving hi gas and the x - ray emitting gas could be due to a non - uniform and/or inhomogeneous density distribution in the ambient medium .",
    "it is also possible that more than one sn exploded within the past few @xmath140 yr .",
    "we have checked for known pulsars in this area , but none are known within the boundary of the putative shell .",
    "the nearest pulsar , psr j0540 + 32 at ( @xmath141 ) = ( @xmath14280 , + 0.@xmath14372 ) , is @xmath144 distant from the center of the hi / continuum feature , and lies at a distance of @xmath1456.2 kpc .",
    "psr j0540 + 32 is thus unlikely to be associated with the progenitor of fvw172.8 + 1.5 .",
    "the hii complex g173 + 1.5 is composed of five sharpless hii  regions s231235 . of these , all but s234 are clustered around a giant molecular cloud ( fig .",
    "at least fourteen embedded star - forming clusters that are 35 myr old around these four hii regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "s234 , located @xmath124 below the other hii regions , also has an associated cluster with young stellar objects having an age of @xmath146 myr @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the formation of some of these star - forming clusters could have been triggered by the first - generation stars in these hii regions .",
    "the presence of an old snr filling the hii complex g173 + 1.5 has an interesting implication .",
    "the five sharpless hii regions are located within the boundary of the hi / continuum structure , suggesting that their formation could have been triggered by sn explosions , stellar winds , or expanding hii regions from a previous generation of stars ( see * ? ? ? * for a review of triggered star formation ) .",
    "the age of the snr for which we have found evidence is , however , only 0.33 myr , so that it is not possible that the current expanding shell triggered the formation of these hii regions .",
    "instead it could be the cluster to which the sn progenitor belonged that triggered the formation of these hii regions .",
    "there are two stellar associations in this area ; aur ob1 at a distance of 1.3 kpc and aur ob2 at 3.2 kpc @xcite .",
    "we suspect that aur ob1 , which is scattered over a wide area , ( @xmath147@xmath148 , @xmath149@xmath150 ) , could be composed of several associations at slightly different distances .",
    "the distance moduli of aur ob1 stars indeed range from 9.69 to 11.67 or 0.9 to 2.2 kpc in distance @xcite .",
    "hd 36483 ( o9iv ) and hd 35921 ( o9.5iii ) that are relatively close to the central area of the hi / continuum structure also belong to aur ob1 .",
    "if one , or both , of these also belonged to the appropriate cluster , then since the main - sequence lifetime of a @xmath151  @xmath152 o9 star is @xmath153 myr @xcite , the star formation in this area began about @xmath154  myr ago . in this scenario ,",
    "the first generation stars triggered the formation of a second generation that are currently exciting the sharpless hii regions ( s231-s235 ) , and we are now observing the formation of third generation stars around these hii regions .",
    "the hii complex g173 + 1.5 could be another good example of sequential star formation over several stellar associations .",
    "we have made high resolution hi 21-cm line observations of a @xmath12 area centered at @xmath155 ) using the alfa 7-beam receiver mounted on the arecibo 305  m telescope .",
    "the data cube provides a detailed view of the fast - moving hi gas at velocities forbidden by galactic rotation in this area .",
    "fvw 172.8 + 1.5 is a feature that appears as a faint wing in low - resolution surveys . by comparison with radio continuum , x - ray , and h@xmath31 maps",
    ", we find evidence that fvw 172.8 + 1.5 is likely to be an old snr within a large hii complex situated in this area .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) the hi emission associated with fvw172.8 + 1.5 is visible from @xmath15 = + 19.5 to + 50.4  km s@xmath4 . at the highest velocities",
    ", the hi appears to be separated into two concentrations . at lower velocities a thin",
    ", filamentary feature appears surrounding these two concentrations .",
    "the increase of the surface area and the amount of hi gas with decreasing velocity suggests that it is an expanding shell .",
    "we attribute the complex morphology to the non - uniformity and inhomogeneity of the ambient medium .",
    "\\(2 ) the high - velocity hi emission features are confined inside the radio continuum filaments associated with the large hii complex g173 + 1.5 and show a very good spatial correlation with them .",
    "this strongly suggests that it has an origin within the complex . adopting a distance of 1.8 kpc , and the systemic velocity of @xmath156 km s@xmath4 of the hii complex to be appropriate for the hi shell , we derive physical parameters for the shell .",
    "these yield a kinetic energy of @xmath157  ergs .",
    "this large kinetic energy and the fast - expansion velocity implies a sn origin .",
    "\\(3 ) we investigated the nature of the filaments in hii complex g173 + 1.5 using multi - wavelength data .",
    "our analysis of the radio continuum spectrum suggests that the radio filaments have both thermal and non - thermal components . a detailed comparison with the associated h@xmath31 filament supports this conclusion .",
    "we also find x - ray emitting hot gas inside the complex with an estimated thermal energy of @xmath139 ergs .",
    "this associated hot gas of comparable thermal energy to the kinetic energy of expansion , and the probable presence of non - thermal radio filaments , supports the conclusion that the hv hi gas is of sn origin .",
    "\\(4 ) from our analysis , we conclude that fvw 172.8 + 1.5 is likely to be an old ( @xmath158 myr ) snr produced inside the hii complex g173 + 1.5 .",
    "we propose that the stellar association to which the progenitor belonged could have triggered the formation of the ob stars currently exciting the hii regions .",
    "the hii complex g173 + 1.5 appears to be a potential example of sequential star formation over several stellar associations .",
