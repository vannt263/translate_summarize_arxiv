    "chromium dioxide ( cro@xmath0 ) , which crystallizes in the tetragonal structure of rutile - type , is a well - known material because of its half - metallic nature with @xmath5 k.@xcite the origin of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and half - metallic property of cro@xmath0 was explained in terms of the double - exchange model.@xcite due to the crystal field of distorted ( flattened ) cr - o@xmath6 octahedra , cr @xmath7 states are split into lower _ _ d__@xmath8 and higher _ _ d__@xmath9/__d__@xmath10 states . out of two @xmath11 electrons of cr@xmath12 ,",

    "_ _ d__@xmath9/__d__@xmath10 that are delocalized near the fermi level ( @xmath13 ) due to the hybridization with o @xmath14 states .",

    "_ d__@xmath9/__d__@xmath10 states , so as to produce the fm and half - metallic properties .",
    "in contrast to numerous reports on electronic and magnetic properties of cro@xmath0 , there have been relatively small number of studies on structural and lattice dynamical properties of cro@xmath0 .",
    "especially , there is no experimental or theoretical report on the phonon dispersion curve for cro@xmath0 , except for a few raman studies.@xcite under the pressure , cro@xmath0 is known to undergo the structural transition from the ground state tetragonal cro@xmath0 ( t - cro@xmath0 ) to the orthorhombic cro@xmath0 ( o - cro@xmath0 ) of cacl@xmath0-type at p = 12 - 14 gpa.@xcite the question followed is whether there will an additional structural transitions from o - cro@xmath0 at higher pressure .",
    "in fact , this question is not just for cro@xmath0 but also relevant to the structural stability issue of transition - metal ( tm ) dioxides ( tmo@xmath0 ) .",

    ", we have studied phonon dispersions and total energies of relevant cro@xmath0 structures as a function of pressure .",
    "based on the calculated phonon dispersions and the total energies , we have found three possible structural transitions with increasing pressure .",

    "et al._@xcite once reported that there would be a magnetic transition in t - cro@xmath0 from half - metallic to nm at p@xmath30 gpa .",
    "however , as discussed above , there occurs a structural transition from t - cro@xmath0 to o - cro@xmath0 at the low pressure of about p=10 gpa .",
    "hence , in fig .",
    "[ phd_80](a ) , we have examined the magnetic moment behavior for o - cro@xmath0 .",
    "it is seen that there is a fm to nm transition at p=76.0 gpa , which is close to the second structural transition point .",
    "the magnetic moment of o - cro@xmath0 suddenly drops at this transition point .",
    "the half - metallic property persists up to this pressure .",
    "this magnetic transition was also observed by kuznetsov _ _ et al.__@xcite , who obtained the transition pressure of p=53 gpa based on the pseudo - potential band method implemented in the vasp code .",
    "it is thus tempting to conjecture that the second transition observed in fig .  [",
    "lattice](a ) corresponds to the magnetic transition in o - cro@xmath0 .",
    "however , the phonon dispersion curve in fig .  [ phd_80](b ) for nm o - cro@xmath0 at p=80.5 gpa shows the strong phonon softenings , indicating that even nm o - cro@xmath0 is unstable at the pressure of p@xmath31 gpa .",
    "therefore , it is not possible that fm o - cro@xmath0 changes into nm o - cro@xmath0 with increasing the pressure .",
    "there might be an additional structural transition in this pressure range .",
    "two candidate structures after the transition are m - cro@xmath0 of moo@xmath0 type and c - cro@xmath0 of caf@xmath0 type .",
    "the monoclinic structure of moo@xmath0 type is chosen from the expectation that , with increasing pressure , two @xmath11 electrons of cr become itinerant , and the local environment becomes similar to that of moo@xmath0 . in a similar system vo@xmath0 , a softening of phonon frequency was observed at * q*=r ( @xmath4 , 0 , @xmath4 ) , which corresponds to the atomic movements from the tetragonal structure of rutile - type to the monoclinic structure.@xcite indeed , the softening mode at * q * = r in fig .",
    "[ phd_80](b ) is related to this structural transition , because the orthorhombic structure of cacl@xmath0 type is nothing but the distorted rutile - type structure .",
    "figure  [ 2soften ] depicts the normal mode of the softened phonon mode at * q * = r. the displacements generate cr - cr dimerization along the c - axis , which is consistent with the main distortions of the transition from the rutile - type to the monoclinic structure .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect the second transition to be from o - cro@xmath0 of cacl@xmath0 type to m - cro@xmath0 of moo@xmath0 type . concerning another candidate , c - cro@xmath0 of caf@xmath0 type ,",
    "there were previous reports predicting the structural transitions from cacl@xmath0 type to caf@xmath0 type structure for cro@xmath0@xcite and ruo@xmath0.@xcite also , caf@xmath0 type is a typical structure of tmo@xmath32 .",

    "the different result is likely to come from their use of a simple tight - binding lmto band method .    the transition from m - cro@xmath0 to c - cro@xmath0 is thought to originate from the increasing packing ratio .",
