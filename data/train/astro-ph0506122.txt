    "technological advances such as space - based telescopes like the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) have expanded our view of the universe to higher redshifts than ever before , giving us the opportunity to look back in time to the earliest stages of galaxy development to determine the mechanisms of galaxy assembly and how galaxies evolved into what we see in the present - day universe . since the optical and near - ir light of high redshift galaxies observed with _",
    "hst _ was emitted in the rest - frame far- to mid - uv ( `` band - pass shifting '' ) , an understanding of the fundamental uv properties of galaxies in general is crucial to our understanding of these high redshift galaxies .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) appear to have characteristics resembling local irregular and peculiar / merging galaxies ( , driver 1995 , 1998 ; glazebrook 1995 ; abraham 1996 ; odewahn 1996 ; ellis 1997 ) , although it is difficult to distinguish these classes at lower linear spatial resolution .",
    "size - luminosity evolution studies show that , at the same luminosity , high redshift galaxies are more compact and less massive than nearby galaxies , as measured in both the uv and optical rest - frames ( giavalisco 1996 ; lowenthal 1997 ; ferguson 2004 ; trujillo 2004 ) .",
    "they show that high redshift galaxies are inherently different from nearby luminous galaxies , regardless of band - pass shifting effects .",
    "therefore , the resemblance of high redshift galaxies to nearby lower - luminosity irregular and peculiar / merging galaxies may be real , and studying stellar population distributions of nearby irregular and peculiar / merging galaxies may provide further understanding of high redshift galaxies , and hence of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "radial color gradients can provide an indication of stellar population or metallicity distribution differences between the inner and outer regions of a galaxy ( as modulated by dust ) , and can constrain certain mechanisms for how a galaxy assembled and subsequently evolved to its present state ( tinsley & larson 1978 ; de jong 1996 ) .",
    "there have been several studies of the optical color gradients of sizable samples of nearby field galaxies .",
    "these include ( but are not limited to ) color gradients of early - type galaxies measured by vader ( 1988 ) from 35 elliptical and early - type spirals in , by franx ( 1989 ) from 17 ellipticals in  and , by peletier ( 1990 ) from 39 ellipticals in  and , and by tamura & ohta ( 2003 ) from 51 rich galaxy cluster e and s0 galaxies in .",
    "all four of these relatively large samples found that ellipticals either become bluer with radius or are constant in color , with color gradients that are generally interpreted as metallicity gradients .",
    "large studies of later - type galaxy color gradients were conducted by several other authors , such as balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) , who measured color gradients from the bulges of 45 early - type spirals in @xmath1 .",
    "de jong ( 1996 ) determined the color gradients of 86 face - on spiral galaxies in @xmath2 , and tully ( 1996 ) did so for 79 galaxies in the ursa major cluster .",
    "jansen ( 2000 ) determined  and color differences between the inner and outer regions of a sample of 196 galaxies of all hubble types .",
    "bell & de jong ( 2000 ) found stellar population and metallicity gradients for their 121 spiral galaxies , and macarthur ( 2004 ) analyzed color gradients and stellar population and metallicity gradients for these plus 51 other galaxies , including some irregular galaxies .",
    "all of these studies confirm the earlier finding ( , sandage 1972 ; persson , frogel & aaronson 1979 ) that spiral galaxies tend to get bluer with increasing radius .",
    "these color gradients were found to be mainly caused by stellar population gradients ( de jong 1996 ; bell & de jong 2000 ; macarthur 2004 ) .",
    "tully ( 1996 ) and jansen ( 2000 ) find that low - luminosity ( @xmath3 mag ) , often late - type / irregular galaxies are equally likely to become bluer or redder outward .",
    "since there is no plausible galaxy formation theory that predicts positive metallicity gradients ( vader 1988 ) , these redder outer parts are most likely due to stellar age effects or dust .",
    "jansen ( 2000 ) find that the low - luminosity galaxies that are bluer in their central regions tend to have strong central h@xmath4 emission , supporting the hypothesis that the color gradients in these galaxies are due to a few star forming regions dominating the local colors . in more luminous massive galaxies ,",
    "a single star forming region can not dominate the azimuthally averaged colors and , hence , the observed color gradients reflect either systematically younger populations or systematically less extinction by dust at larger distances from the center .",
    "the presence of a bulge is likely to enhance such color gradients .    due to significant atmospheric extinction and the poor response of most older thick ccd detectors below the balmer break ,",
    "large studies of the near - uv properties of galaxies , especially of the fainter irregular galaxies which seem to be analogs of the majority of high redshift galaxies , have not been feasible until the recent advent of large format uv sensitive detectors in space , such as on the balloon - born foca telescope ( milliard 1992 ) , sounding rocket and astro / uit flights ( bohlin 1991 ; hill 1992 ; kuchinski 2000 ; marcum 2001 ) , and hst / wfpc2 ( windhorst 2002 ) . the overall uv properties of galaxies in general , and of faint late - type galaxies in particular ,",
    "is still rather poorly understood .",
    "mid - uv and , to a lesser extent , @xmath5-band data are particularly useful for color gradient analysis : because the uv is more sensitive to changes in age and metallicity , color gradients will be more apparent .",
    "a color gradient will be more significant with a longer base - line in wavelength coverage between the two filters used , such that it is most useful to obtain equally deep images in filters at both mid - uv and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "additionally , data at intermediate wavelengths are necessary to properly sample a large range of stellar populations .",
    "the high resolution of _ hst _ mid - uv and @xmath6 images allow us to resolve individual stars or associations , which provides further , more detailed information about the distribution of metallicity and stellar populations within a galaxy .",
    "the addition of @xmath0-band _ hst _ images removes some of the dust degeneracy in a color analysis , considerably improving stellar population measurements over optical colors alone ( cardiel 2003 ) .    in order to address the deficit",
    "of published color gradient studies for a large , homogeneous sample of irregular , peculiar , and merging galaxies across a large range of optical wavelengths , we present a data - set of 142 galaxies observed at the vatican advanced technology telescope ( vatt ) in ( ) .",
    "we also present supplemental _ hst _",
    "mid - uv and near - ir data for six galaxies .",
    "we discuss these datasets in section 2 and describe the data analysis in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results , complementing the findings of previous studies and increasing the database of color gradients to include a larger sample of irregular and peculiar / merging galaxies . in section 5",
    "we compare our results to those of the high - redshift universe , and discuss possible implications on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we selected 82 galaxies from the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs 1991 ) with ( 1 ) types later than or equal to sd ( de vaucouleurs type @xmath7 t @xmath8 ) , ( 2 ) sizes small enough to comfortably fit within the @xmath96.4  fov of the vatt imager ( to ensure accurate subtraction of the sky background ) , and ( 3 ) @xmath10-band surface brightness - band magnitude per unit area within the rc3 25  @xmath10-band isophote . ]",
    "brighter than @xmath11  , to ensure efficient imaging at the vatt and with hst .",
    "the median diameter of the galaxies in this sample is @xmath91.4 , and the median surface brightness is @xmath923.0 .",
    "we supplemented this sample with 23 galaxies from the list of hibbard & vacca ( 1997 ) which contains ugc galaxies classified as peculiar or interacting .",
    "we imposed the same size and surface brightness criteria while excluding galaxies already imaged by john hibbard and collaborators .",
    "lastly , for comparison we included 13 earlier type galaxies ( t @xmath12 ) and 24 unclassified or peculiar galaxies that were observed for other projects .",
    "the total sample therefore contains 142 galaxies , most of which are irregular or peculiar / merging .",
    "1 shows the resulting hubble type distribution of our galaxy sample .",
    "it shows both the distribution of types from the rc3 and from our own visual classifications , which are the average of the values assigned to each galaxy by three different observers ( v.a.t .",
    ", s.h.c . )",
    "experienced with classifying galaxies .",
    "a type of t=@xmath13 was assigned to the rare cases where no classification could be determined . because mergers may play an important role in galaxy evolution via hierarchical galaxy formation models ,",
    "a type of t=14 was assigned to those galaxies that appeared to be interacting , or in the stages of a merger or post - merger . this extra class",
    "was created so that galaxies under the special condition of interactions and mergers could be treated separately .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .  1 compares our classifications to those of the rc3 , which for the most part agree .",
    "differences between our classifications and those of the rc3 are partially due to galaxies that were unclassified in the rc3 being classifiable from our ccd images .",
    "additionally , our classifiers classified several rc3 irregular types as late - type spirals .",
    "this misclassification in the rc3 is also evident in the hst images of windhorst ( 2002 ) , and is due to the difficulty of accurately classifying these small , faint galaxies with the photographic plates used for the rc3 .",
    "these plates had lower spatial resolution , signal - to - noise , and dynamic range than our vatt ccd and hst images , such that faint spiral structure may have been missed .",
    "since most of our sample was chosen from the rc3 , biases that are inherent in the rc3 itself will also exist in our own sample .",
    "we can test for the consistency of our sample with respect to the rc3 through a comparison between the samples of several quantities .",
    "fig .  2 compares the ( _ a _ ) 25  @xmath10-band isophotal diameter , ( _ b _ ) axis ratio ( @xmath14 ) , ( _ c _ ) total @xmath10-band magnitude ( @xmath15 ) , and ( _ d _ ) total ( ) color distributions of the rc3 to the measurements for our sample .",
    "only galaxies with diameters less than the @xmath96  fov of the vatt ccd are included in fig .",
    "2__a__. this does not affect the shape of the distribution , since only @xmath16 1% of the galaxies in the rc3 have diameters larger than 6 .",
    "our diameter distribution closely resembles that of the rc3 .",
    "2__b _ _ shows that our sample is underrepresented in very flat galaxies , which is to be expected from the deficit of early- to mid - type spiral galaxies in our sample , which are more likely to appear flat when viewed edge - on .",
    "our sample also peaks at a slightly fainter @xmath15 magnitude and a much bluer ( ) @xmath17 color than the rc3 ( fig .",
    "2__c _ _ and 2__d _",
    "_ , respectively ) .",
    "this is also to be expected with a late - type galaxy - selected sample , because later - type galaxies are on average fainter and bluer than earlier - type galaxies .",
    "the six galaxies observed with _ hst _",
    "nicmos are part of a larger sample of 136 galaxies observed in the mid - uv ( f300w ) and near - ir ( f814w ) by wfpc2 ( windhorst 2002 ; eskridge 2003 ; de grijs 2003 ) , which overlaps significantly with our vatt sample .",
    "the entire _ hst _ data - set will be analyzed in more detail in later papers ( , taylor 2005 , in prep . ) .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "sample was chosen to include galaxies that were predicted to be uv bright and small enough for most of the galaxy to fit within the wfpc2 fov .",
    "we obtained our ground - based observations at the vatt at mt .",
    "graham international observatory ( mgio , az ) with the 2k@xmath182k direct imager because of its high sensitivity in the near - uv , which is critical for our ultimate science goals . the effective quantum efficiency in @xmath5 is @xmath940% , which includes transmission loss through the atmosphere combined with the @xmath975% transmission of the ccd and the @xmath967% transmission of the filter . we binned the ccd images 2@xmath182 upon read - out , giving a pixel scale of @xmath9@xmath19 pixel@xmath20 .",
    "the typical seeing at the vatt is well sampled by this pixel scale ( taylor 2004 ) .",
    "the detector read - noise is 5.7@xmath21 and the gain is 1.9@xmath21adu@xmath20 .",
    "typical exposure times used for the galaxies in our sample were 2@xmath18600 s in @xmath5 , 2@xmath18300 s in @xmath10 , 2@xmath18240 s in @xmath22 , and 2@xmath18180 s in @xmath23 for galaxies with average total surface brightness brighter than @xmath24  , and twice these exposure times for lower surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the long exposure times in @xmath5 and @xmath10 relative to @xmath22 and @xmath23 were chosen to overcome the lower sensitivity and higher atmospheric extinction in these pass - bands , such that colors within the galaxies can be reliably measured at larger radii before the low surface brightness @xmath5 and @xmath10 light is lost within the sky noise .",
    "observations were spread over 9 runs between 1999 april and 2002 april .",
    "photometric nights were defined as those with magnitudes measured for a particular standard star varying no more than 3% throughout the night . during photometric nights , short photometric exposures were taken of galaxies that were observed during non - photometric conditions .",
    "table  1 contains a list of all 142 galaxies for which we obtained a full set of calibrated observations in .",
    "the full table is available only in the electronic edition .",
    "each galaxy is assigned an internal i d number ( column 1 ) , which we will use for brevity throughout the remainder of the paper when referring to a particular galaxy .",
    "the average sky background level in each image was determined by taking the median of the median pixel values in 13 120@xmath18120 pixel regions along the image border that were relatively devoid of objects .",
    "thus , we minimize contamination by light from the galaxy , which is usually centered within each image . taking the median values",
    "also helps to reject stars , background galaxies , and cosmic rays .",
    "sky gradients have little effect on these sky measurements since , after flat fielding , the sky background in each image on scales of @xmath96  is flat to better than 1% , and typically to @xmath90.5% in each of the filters .",
    "these sky - values were used in the reduction process , but local and global sky - values were recalculated in a more sophisticated way where appropriate , as described in sections below .",
    "table  1 lists these sky background levels ( column 11 ) and corresponding sky surface brightnesses ( column 13 ) and seeing estimates ( column 14 ) determined from the median stellar fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) in each image , using the method described in taylor ( 2004 ) , where the sky surface brightness and seeing trends in these vatt data are analyzed in more detail .",

    "three 500  s exposures were taken of each galaxy . since nic3 has a small fov of @xmath27 , we dithered by about 45 pixels between the three observations to include more of the galaxy in the final mosaic and to facilitate bad pixel removal .",

    "because these exposures were taken during the day when some sunlight may have leaked onto the detector , they represent an upper limit of the actual dark current , which may be even smaller .",
    "there is an average dark current of @xmath38 adu / hr , which results in a worst case scenario ( column 5 ) of @xmath39 adu in our longest exposure of 1200 seconds in the @xmath5-band , and which is very small compared to the median @xmath5 sky of @xmath40 adu .",
    "if dark current is neglected , this leads to a possible average error in the absolute sky determinations of 0.51% in @xmath5 , 0.16% in @xmath10 , 0.08% in @xmath22 , and 0.05% in @xmath23 ( which only matters when finding the absolute sky surface brightnesses , and will not affect the galaxy photometry , even to second order ) .",
    "much larger errors can be introduced through various other uncertainties in the photometry , and subtracting a dark image will only introduce another source of noise without any benefit to the large - scale galaxy surface photometry .",
    "therefore , we did not subtract a dark image or a , likely overestimated , constant dark level from the images .",
    "all images were zero subtracted , flat fielded , and calibrated with landolt standard stars ( landolt 1992 ) using standard methods in iraf .",

    "the vatt , at present , does not offer a reliable way of taking dome flats , so only twilight sky - flat fields were used .",
    "we were usually able to obtain at least 34 good evening sky - flats per filter per night , and at least another 34 morning sky - flats , which sufficed to remove all traces of high frequency structure .",
    "after flat - fielding , at most a 1% gradient in the sky background remained across the entire image .",
    "differences in illumination of the detector between the twilight and night sky , which depend at least in part on the position of the telescope relative to the sun and moon , appear to be the cause . because this gradient is less than 1% across the entire image , and",
    "because most of our galaxies are @xmath91  in size and centered in the exposure , galaxy photometry will be only slightly affected by this gradient , especially when compared to other larger sources of uncertainty .",
    "a 1% error in the sky corresponds on average to 27.0 , 27.5 , 26.5 , and 26.0  in @xmath5 , @xmath10 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively ( as calculated from the average sky brightnesses presented in taylor ( 2004 ) ) , which is fainter than the level at which our surface brightness profiles are reliably determined , and therefore should have little effect on our results .",

    "cosmic rays were removed using an iraf script by rhoads ( 2000 ) , which rejects cosmic rays based on filtering out the point spread function ( psf ) minus a user - scaled delta function , and rejecting any objects below a defined threshold to remove those objects that are much sharper than the psf , and therefore can not be real objects .",

    "] some bad pixels that were not removed with the pipeline bad pixel mask were removed by hand .",
    "the wfpc2 images were registered to the nicmos images by manually finding the coordinates of stars in common between images in each field , and by using these in ` geomap ` and ` geotran ` in iraf to apply the proper transformations .",
    "non - target sources in all images were patched within lmorpho to an average local sky - value using the same method as with the vatt data .",
    "we adopted the holtzmann ( 1995 ) zero points for each wfpc2 image .",
    "surface brightness profiles were calculated with lmorpho for each galaxy within 12 equally spaced elliptical annuli , starting from the galaxy center .",
    "parameters such as galaxy center , annulus radius , axis ratio , and position angle were chosen to match the shape of the outer isophotes , and were fixed in the @xmath23-band for the vatt data , and the nicmos f160w band for the _ hst _ data .",
    "these were then applied to all other pass - bands in order to achieve matched aperture photometry that could be directly and consistently translated into a color profile .",
    "the random error was calculated for the surface brightnesses with the formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the measured average flux per pixel above sky within the annulus , and n is the number of pixels in the annulus .",
    "this does not include systematic errors due to small sky - subtraction errors , which can result in significant errors in the galaxy surface brightnesses as calculated at large radii , making the last few points in the surface brightness profiles less reliable than the inner points .",
    "because the fov in the vatt images ( 6.4 ) is much larger than the size of most of the galaxies ( diameter @xmath91 ) , and because the fields tend to be un - crowded at high galactic and ecliptic latitude , we expect few objects to contaminate the vatt sky determinations .",
    "errors due to the small ( @xmath43 ) gradients in the sky tend to drop out in the ellipse fitting , as long as the background shows no higher order structure .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "nicmos data , however , have a much smaller fov ( 51.2 ) . therefore , it is much more difficult to obtain sky - values in the _ hst _ images that are not contaminated by the galaxy , and as such the points in the outer part of the _ hst _ profiles are less reliable than those in the vatt images .",
    "these larger uncertainties in the outer profile points are accounted for when determining color gradients , as described in   3.2 , such that they will have minimal impact on the accuracy of our final results .",

    ", our major axis radii , @xmath45 , were converted to _ elliptical _ or _ equivalent _ radii , @xmath46 .",
    "the solid curves represent an estimate of the average 1-@xmath47 error found by adding our errors in quadrature with those of jansen ( 2000 ) . for the most part ,",
    "both our profiles agree within the uncertainties , with a few slightly deviant points that can be attributed to various differences in the way that the two profiles were created .",
    "jansen ( 2000 ) applied a color term correction to each annulus separately , while we applied a single color term to the entire galaxy , based on its overall average color .",
    "the color term correction is small and difficult to measure accurately without a large number of standard stars of all colors taken throughout each observing night ( which would sacrifice significant galaxy observing time ) .",
    "therefore , errors introduced by using the average color of a galaxy to determine an average color term will be small compared to the errors inherent in measuring the small color term correction , and will therefore have little effect on our results .",
    "in extreme cases , this will cause the profiles to vary only slightly , if the galaxy color is a significant function of radius .",
    "larger deviations in color gradient measurements are introduced by different choices of the galaxy center , and its axis ratio and position angle , which is especially an issue for galaxies with irregular or peculiar morphologies . for these morphologies ,",
    "the choice of center is somewhat subjective , and the brightest peak often does not coincide with the center of the outer parts or disk .",
    "that center , and the shape and orientation of the isophotes , can vary significantly with radius .",
    "this effect can lead to vast differences in the choice of axis ratio and position angle , depending on how the observer chose to define them . in our case , these parameters were calculated automatically by lmorpho , then inspected manually , with a few values tweaked to change the center , ellipticities , and position angles from the brightest un - centered peak to the center and shape of the outer disk .",
    "the choice of these parameters has the largest effect on the inner parts of the profiles , where a change in adopted axis ratio and orientation may result in different structures within the galaxy being sampled .",

    "our profiles generally agree with those of jansen ( 2000 ) within a few tenths of a magnitude , which is similar to the differences they found in comparing their profiles with several other independent observers .",
    "the galaxy with the largest disagreement between our and jansen s profiles is ngc3913 , which is an asymmetric spiral galaxy .",
    "this asymmetry makes the choice of position angle and axis ratio particularly important , such that small changes in either could have a significant effect on the surface brightness profile . here",
    ", jansen ( 2000 ) used an axis ratio ( @xmath14 ) of 0.9333 and a position angle ( pa ) ( east of north ) of 165 , compared to our @xmath14 of 0.967 and pa of 38.4 , which could account for the relatively large discrepancy in our surface brightness profiles .",

    "points where the measured average flux per pixel was smaller than @xmath52 were not included in the fit in order to ignore values that have large uncertainties due to low signal - to - noise . to obtain more reliable color gradients , we weighted the points on the color profile by their errors .",
    "all radii were normalized to the effective radius in order to allow comparison of galaxies with various sizes .",
    "therefore , our adopted units for the color profile slopes are the change in color ( @xmath53mag ) per unit effective radius ( @xmath51 ) , where a positive slope indicates that a galaxy is getting redder with increasing radius from its center , and a negative slope indicates that it becomes bluer outward .",

    "therefore , we measured all _ hst _ color gradients across the entire galaxy profile , such that the units for the slopes are change in color ( @xmath53mag ) per @xmath54 , where @xmath54 is the radius of the outer - most annulus used in the surface brightness profile ( which was defined to go out far enough to include most of the light visible in the f160w image ) .",

    "this similarity in trends is not surprising , since all of these parameters are not entirely independent , with later hubble type galaxies tending to be fainter , smaller , and sometimes rounder than earlier type galaxies , with disks that are less rotationally supported .",

    "dust may also play a role in reddening the inner parts of these galaxies , which would further decrease the color gradient .",

    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of other authors , who find that the observed color gradients for mid- to late - type galaxies are most likely due to stellar population effects ( vader 1988 ; de jong 1996 ; jansen 2000 ; bell & de jong 2000 ; macarthur 2004 )",

    "the four galaxies with the largest @xmath75 , however , have small color gradient slopes , which is consistent with the most massive galaxies being earlier type galaxies , which have been shown in multiple studies to have small color gradients with bluer regions typically at larger radii ( vader 1988 ; franx 1989 ; peletier 1990 ) .",
    "these results raise the question of whether the late - type galaxies that get redder with increasing radius actually have redder colors in their outskirts than other galaxies ( perhaps due to a particularly old stellar population in the outer disk , or a radially increasing dust content ) , or whether they simply have uncommonly blue inner regions ( perhaps due to younger or more metal poor stars in the inner parts of the galaxy ) .",

    "would be common factors in galaxy evolution .",

    "dust in the interiors of these galaxies may also redden their colors .",

    "if this overall picture of galaxy assembly is correct , then galaxies that more recently underwent a hierarchical merger or accretion event would be _ more likely _ to become redder than to become bluer with increasing radius than galaxies that have remained unperturbed and are substantially more relaxed today .",
    "because the merger rate at high redshift is higher , higher redshift galaxies would on average be redder with increasing radius than lower redshift galaxies , and nearby low - mass , low - luminosity , late - type and interacting galaxies would on average be redder with increasing radius than their high - mass , high - luminosity , early - type counterparts that formed predominantly at higher redshift .",
    "this scenario can therefore be tested by examining how color gradients depend on galaxy type , luminosity , and redshift .",
    "the process of galaxy formation may be more complicated , depending in part on the galaxy s type , luminosity , and mass , and on its surrounding environment , as discussed by tamura & ohta ( 2003 ) , who determined that elliptical galaxies in rich galaxy clusters get bluer with increasing radius , and that larger and more luminous galaxies have steeper color gradients .",
    "these trends are consistent with models for formation through monolithic collapse ( eggen 1962 ; larson 1974 ; carlberg 1984 ) . in field",

    "balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) discuss the implications of early - type spiral galaxy bulge luminosity on the galaxy s formation process .",
    "they find that bright bulges show a steeper color gradient with increasing bulge luminosity , while faint bulge color gradients become significantly bluer outward , and show no such relation with luminosity .",

    "fainter , less massive bulges , however , would have a different formation mechanism due to interactions with the disk ( , kannappan 2004 ) .",
    "although the formation and evolution of specific galaxies may depend on various factors , our general results are consistent with the predictions of bottom - up hierarchical galaxy formation , where our more relaxed high - mass , high - luminosity , early- to mid - type galaxies become either bluer with increasing radius or have no color gradient , and our low - mass , low - luminosity late - type galaxies tend to be redder on average with increasing radius .",
    "this is in agreement with trends seen in the high redshift universe in the hubble deep field north by moth & elston ( 2002 ) , who found that galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( z = 0.51.2 ) tend to on average get bluer with increasing radius , while high redshift galaxies ( z = 23.5 ) , which are expected to be experiencing more interactions and mergers , get on average redder with increasing radius .",
    "moth ( 2002 ) determined that dust is unable to account for the strongly bluer central regions at high redshifts , and that it must therefore be due to more centrally concentrated star formation .",

    "<S> we introduce a dataset of 142 mostly late - type spiral , irregular , and peculiar ( interacting or merging ) nearby galaxies observed in  at the vatican advanced technology telescope ( vatt ) , and present an analysis of their radial color gradients . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that nearby elliptical and early- to mid - type spiral galaxies show either no or only small color gradients , becoming slightly bluer with radius . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we find that late - type spiral , irregular , peculiar , and merging galaxies become on average redder with increasing distance from the center . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter in radial color gradient trends increases toward later hubble type . as a preliminary analysis of a larger data - set obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , we also analyze the color gradients of six nearby galaxies observed with nicmos in the near - ir ( @xmath0 ) and with wfpc2 in the mid - uv ( f300w ) and red ( f814w ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible implication of these results on galaxy formation and compare our nearby galaxy color gradients to those at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we present examples of images and  radial surface brightness and color profiles , and of the tables of measurements ; the full atlas and tables are published in the electronic edition only . </S>"
