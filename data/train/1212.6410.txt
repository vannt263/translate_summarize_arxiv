    "pulsatile flows , here intended as flows driven by a time - periodic force ( generally the pressure gradient ) , are encountered in many contexts of practical interest . amongst them , a remarkable case is that of heart - beat driven , human physiological flows , including blood circulation  @xcite and ( less directly ) cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) flow  @xcite . besides bio - fluid dynamics",
    ", time - periodic flows are widely studied with regard to e.g. chemical - physics applications , like species separation  @xcite , as well as for mass and heat transfer problems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many studies can be found in the literature which address pulsatile flows in a more general ( yet still application - driven ) fluidic context , like peristaltic pumping  @xcite , to name but one .",
    "however , in many cases of practical interest the pressure gradient is unknown or hardly measurable , and the only available datum is the time - dependent flux ( hereafter , flux and flow rate are understood as synonyms ) .",
    "this is the most common measurement , for instance , in clinical settings regarding blood and csf flow .    as for blood flow",
    ", it is difficult for many portions of the vasculature to keep an ideal , circular cross - section , due to the presence of surrounding organs ( possibly activated by relevant muscles , or simply displaced by postural changes ) . hence , while keeping some degree of abstractness , it is more appropriate to consider an elliptical cross - section to obtain a more accurate description of the flow ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as for csf flow",
    ", the spinal sub - arachnoid space can be well approximated by an elliptical annulus  @xcite ; csf dynamics in such a domain is affected by pulsatility ( mainly towards the upper cervical region ) and plays a major role in the ( still poorly understood ) pathophysiology of many high - impact disease , like syringomyelia and chiari malformation  @xcite .",
    "of course , in order to tackle realistic 3d flow conditions , for instance associated with patient - specific geometries , a fully numerical approach is mandatory ( see e.g.  @xcite for the csf case ) .",
    "this implies the exploitation of rather time - consuming approaches , even when adopting a classical newtonian behavior for the working fluid ( as surely appropriate for csf  @xcite , as well as for blood in large vessels  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to keep some degree of physical representativeness also by adopting the hypothesis of a fully - developed flow ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , despite its inherent oversimplifications from a physical viewpoint . such a position has been systematically adopted in many studies in order to obtain analytical flow solutions ( see below ) , otherwise hardly achievable . however , even by considering a fully - developed flow , it is necessary to solve a non - standard , _ inverse problem _ in order to evaluate the velocity field ( and the pressure gradient ) by starting from a given flux across any cross - section of a vessel .",
    "with reference to the above observations , we point out to expressly confine our attention to a special class of flow solutions , namely fully - developed flows of an incompressible newtonian fluid in a straight cylinder with elliptical cross - section ( either simply connected or not , see below ) . in particular , these assumptions permit to address a simplified linear problem , for which superposition principle holds .",
    "nevertheless , the adopted positions aim at obtaining a benchmark solution for the inverse problem described below : this is the main target of the present work . more precisely , by virtue of the fully - developed flow hypothesis",
    ", we provide a numerical strategy which is substantially grounded on analytical relations , while being more amenable to implementation than previous ones proposed in literature .",
    "hence , while laying no claims of generality ( not even deliberately addressing realistic three - dimensional flows , e.g. within patient specific geometries and possibly involving complex rheological effects ) , the method we propose is credited to hold some value for obtaining at least an approximation to real flow conditions , while containing the computational cost , in the spirit of benchmark flow solutions .",
    "furthermore , the obtained solution strategy can be used as an improved source of boundary data for more ambitious numerical approaches based on realistic data , up to serving as a debugging tool .",
    "it is worth stressing once again that we address the inverse problem , for which no straightforward approaches have been well established so far .",
    "to better define the problem , we consider the motion of an incompressible ( the constant density is here normalized to 1 ) , newtonian fluid in a semi - infinite straight pipe @xmath1 . in the sequel",
    "@xmath2 will be either an ellipse or an elliptical annulus ( even if results for circular cross - sections are also recalled , and some abstract results can be obtained for any smooth and bounded cross - section ) .",
    "the governing equations are therefore the incompressible navier - stokes equations which , in a reference frame with @xmath3 directed along the pipe axis ( and @xmath4 belonging to an orthogonal plane ) , read @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively denote velocity and pressure , and @xmath8 represents kinematic viscosity .",
    "furthermore , as anticipated , we deliberately neglect turbulent effects by looking for a special class of solutions , namely fully - developed solutions ( also named poiseuille - type solutions ) of the following form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes an arbitrary function which disappears from the equations , since pressure only enters through its spatial gradient in the formulation of the problem .",
    "in addition , the following flux condition is assumed to be satisfied : @xmath11 for some given scalar function @xmath12 , only depending on the time variable . by standard arguments",
    ", the above poiseuille - type _ ansatz _ implies that we may assume that the pressure has the form @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the dependence of @xmath14 on the space variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 allows us to consider a problem reduced to the cross - section @xmath17 , with the given flux condition .",
    "this implies that we have to study the following problem : find @xmath18 such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the laplacian with respect to the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this can be considered as an inverse problem since , if the axial pressure gradient @xmath21 is known , one can evaluate @xmath14 ( by solving a two - dimensional scalar heat equation ) and thus the corresponding flux as well .",
    "contrarily , in our problem the datum is the flux @xmath12 and one wants to find the corresponding velocity and pressure associated with the fully - developed solution ( such a problem is linked to one of the nowadays classical leray s problems  @xcite ) . for the sake of completeness , we recall that existence and uniqueness of the fully - developed solution in pipes with very general cross - sections ( and with explicit but not exact expression in terms of the flux ) have been recently obtained in  @xcite , under reasonable regularity on the periodic @xmath12 .",
    "the relevance of the cross - section shape on the solution process deserves some discussion at this stage .",
    "indeed , when considering a circular cross - section , one can write an explicit solution in terms of special functions . in particular , the analytical solution of the direct problem was firstly obtained by sexl  @xcite and womersley  @xcite in terms of bessel functions , while we recently derived in  @xcite an analytical solution to the inverse problem involving regularized confluent hyper - geometric functions .",
    "such a fully analytical approach is made possible by the particularly simple expression taken by the laplace operator in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "in fact , when considering an elliptical cross - section , in spite of the apparent similarity with the circular case , the situation drastically changes : an explicit solution can only be obtained for the stationary problem , while it is necessary to resort to numerical computations already when addressing the direct time - dependent problem  @xcite .",
    "in particular , current solutions in literature are based on involved tools like the mathieu functions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some numerical approaches which also tackle the inverse problem have been recently proposed  @xcite , still by invoking the mathieu functions , also involving the determination of the laplacian eigenvalues in an elliptical domain .",
    "yet this is not a trivial task : there are several works emphasizing how instabilities can arise in the numerical computations when addressing such a problem by directly managing the mathieu functions , especially when the ellipse eccentricity is small  @xcite .",
    "indeed , computing the mathieu functions has been recognized as the most critical issue in  @xcite ; major efforts have been spent in order to define a wise algorithm for their evaluation .    in the light of these points",
    ", we propose an alternative numerical approach to the inverse problem of a pulsatile fully - developed flow in elliptical vessels .",
    "our approach only indirectly addresses the mathieu problem and therefore it does not suffer from the aforementioned limitations .",
    "some numerical simulations are also reported , based on flow rates actually measured for human blood flow in the internal carotid artery , and csf flow in the upper cervical region of the human spine .",
    "corresponding results support the effective usability of our formulation ( successfully coping with small eccentricities as well ) , by virtue of the dramatic reduction in computational time it allows , as compared to more elaborated finite element approaches .",
    "this , in turn , broadens the application spectrum of our solution , as highlighted in the last section of the present work .",
    "* plan of the paper : * in section  [ sec_prob_staz ] we review relevant issues regarding stationary , fully - developed flows in elliptical cross - sections , either simply connected or not .",
    "some results related to circular cross - sections are also recalled , for completeness . in section  [ sec : time - dependent ] we propose a novel , computationally - efficient numerical strategy for solving the inverse time - dependent problem , by also exploiting an auxiliary , direct formulation . in particular , besides recalling recent results for the the circular cross - section , we discuss in detail the case of the simply connected elliptical section ( being the annular case very similar ) . furthermore , exemplificative numerical simulations are reported in section  [ sec_numtest ] , based on blood and csf physiological flow data ; computational cost of the proposed strategy is also compared to more elaborate , finite element numerical approaches . concluding remarks are finally reported in section  [ sec_conclusions ] , where the potential for effective application of our solution is highlighted , with explicit references to the biomedical and microrobotic research field .",
    "despite being classical , the stationary solution in the elliptical cross - section is re - derived in a way that is functional to subsequent treatment .",
    "classical results for the circular cross - section are recalled as well , for completeness .",
    "such a stationary problem is formulated as a poisson problem with dirichlet boundary conditions ( besides the flux condition ) , namely : find @xmath22 such that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the given flux , while @xmath25 is the constant pressure gradient .",
    "the history of this problem dates back to the work of hagen and poiseuille ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) , who firstly derived the solution in a circular domain .",
    "nonetheless , the interest for such a special solution ( which can be easily derived thanks to complete separation of variables ) is still considerable , as a benchmark flow also in applications to turbulence ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or for innovative biomedical applications ( like magnetic particle targeting  @xcite ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that poiseuille flow represents one of the few examples of exact solution of fluid equations which are not space - periodic , yet with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath17 be a circle with radius @xmath26 and centered at the origin , namely : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "for such a case the solution to   is easily obtained , namely the well - known parabolic profile @xmath29      let @xmath17 be a circular annulus delimited by radii @xmath30 and @xmath31 , namely : @xmath32 . in this case the solution of the poisson problem   is @xmath33 notice the limiting behavior of   for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we review some well - known results , which will be needed later on to handle the time - dependent case .",
    "relevant solutions for this problem originally appeared in the pioneering works of khamrui  @xcite and verma  @xcite ( besides earlier , preliminary contributions cited therein ) . also in the present case it is possible to obtain an analytical solution , thanks to the particularly simple expression of the external force in the poisson problem ( [ eq : basic_flow - stationary ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth mentioning that numerical approximation of the aforementioned problem in an elliptical domain , yet with more general external forces , is the subject of ongoing research ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath36 denote an ellipse , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively denote the length of the major ( @xmath15-direction ) and minor semi - axis ( @xmath16-direction ) , while @xmath39 represents the inter - focal distance .",
    "we preliminarily observe that the equality @xmath40 implies @xmath41 , from which @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then , to construct the solution we introduce the natural change of variables @xmath44 with jacobian @xmath45    = \\frac{a^2}{2 } \\left[-\\frac{e^{-2i\\theta}}{2}+                           \\cosh ( 2\\eta )                          -\\frac{e^{2i\\theta}}{2}\\right].\\ ] ] by employing this change of variables we can reduce the problem in the rectangular domain @xmath46 and it is well - known that the laplace operator is separable with these coordinates .",
    "furthermore , by applying the aforementioned change of variables , the poisson equation   becomes @xmath47 where @xmath48 simply represents @xmath49 in the new variables ( please also notice that @xmath50 for @xmath51 ) .",
    "moreover , we observe that an additional neumann condition is needed at @xmath52 , as detailed below . due to periodicity in @xmath53",
    ", the solution can be written with the following complex fourier series expansion with respect to @xmath53 ( hereafter `` hat '' @xmath54 denotes a complex fourier coefficient ) : @xmath55 by virtue of linearity , we temporarily assume @xmath56 and we recast the problem at hand as follows ( for the function @xmath57 which is @xmath58-periodic in @xmath53 and temporarily we do not assign the flux ) : @xmath59 we then plug in the poisson equation the fourier series for both @xmath57 and @xmath60 , as given in  , and we observe that , in order to have a real - valued solution , we need to impose as usual @xmath61 ( hereafter `` bar '' @xmath62 denotes complex conjugacy ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath63 ( hereafter @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively denote the real and imaginary part ) .",
    "moreover , by using the symmetries of the solution ( reflections over the ellipse axes of symmetry ) it follows that @xmath66 for @xmath67 odd .",
    "furthermore , in order to have a smooth solution also at @xmath52 , we need to impose @xmath68 . as a result , by exploiting the above conditions , and by observing that @xmath69 only possesses three non - zero modes ( namely those associated with @xmath70 ) , we obtain the following identity : @xmath71    \\,e^{in\\theta}=\\frac{a^2}{2 } \\left[-\\frac{e^{-2i\\theta}}{2}+       \\cosh ( 2\\eta ) -\\frac{e^{2i\\theta}}{2}\\right],\\ ] ] which corresponds to a system of three complex ordinary differential equations . in the above expression and in the sequel , `` prime '' @xmath72 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "then , by equating the terms corresponding to the same exponential , and by recalling the conditions at @xmath74 coming from the dirichlet condition and from the symmetries of the solution , we have to solve the following boundary value problems :    @xmath75    hence , by explicitly solving these uncoupled linear differential equations we get @xmath76 then , by summing - up the solutions after multiplication by the corresponding complex exponential , and after some algebraic manipulations , the solution to the problem with @xmath56 turns out to be @xmath77 being the corresponding flux @xmath78 \\ , d\\theta \\right ) \\ , d\\eta        = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{32 \\nu } \\ , \\sinh^2(2b ) \\ , \\tanh(2b).\\ ] ] that said , the solution to the original problem   with given flux @xmath79 is finally obtained as @xmath80 , i.e. by scaling the function @xmath48 computed right above by the following factor : @xmath81^{-1 } , \\label{eq_f2lambda_staz}\\ ] ] accounting for the actual flow rate .",
    "finally , by mapping back to cartesian coordinates , the sought solution reads @xmath82 .",
    "\\label{staz_ellisse_scalato}\\ ] ] it is interesting to note how the solution   derives from poiseuille solution   by a simple anisotropic scaling of the variables ( as for obtaining the considered elliptical domain by starting from the unit circle ) .",
    "thus , the elegant expression   ( appearing in e.g.  @xcite , yet missing in many related works ) could have been obtained through simpler derivations .",
    "nevertheless , we deliberately decided to introduce many details above , since they serve as useful references for the solution of the corresponding time - dependent problem . on regard",
    ", it should be noticed how , despite separation of variables ( in elliptical coordinates ) , ellipticity _ per se _ creates a new situation already when considering stationary conditions : there appear 3 coupled modes in the solution ( contrarily to the fully decoupled flow solution in the circle ) .",
    "such a difference persists and it is somehow magnified in the time - dependent case , where more complex behaviors naturally appear ( see section  [ sec : time - dependent ] ) .",
    "given the inter - focal distance @xmath39 , it is straightforward to apply   in order to also map two confocal ellipses into a rectangular region .",
    "more precisely , given semi - axes @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , the rectangle @xmath86 is obtained , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are derived from the respective semi - axes through  . for this problem",
    "we have dirichlet boundary conditions at both @xmath89 and @xmath90 . hence , by enforcing the symmetries",
    "@xmath91 needed to have real - valued velocities , we end up with the following boundary value problems ( for the auxiliary problem with @xmath56 ) : @xmath92 whose solutions , by direct integration , read : @xmath93,\\\\ \\widehat{u}_{\\pm2}(\\eta ) & = & \\frac{a^2}{16 \\nu } \\left [ \\frac{e^{2(\\eta - b_2 ) } - e^{-2(\\eta - b_2 ) } - e^{2(\\eta - b_1 ) } + e^{-2(\\eta - b_1 ) } } { e^{2(b_1-b_2 ) } - e^{-2(b_1-b_2 ) } } -1 \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the following stationary solution for the auxiliary problem is obtained ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath94 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , by reasoning as in section  [ lab_flusso_ell_mathieau ] , the solution to   with given flux @xmath79 is obtained as @xmath80 , with ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath95^{-1}.\\ ] ] following  @xcite , it is worth remarking that the solution in the ( simply connected ) ellipse can not be obtained as a limit case of the one in the annulus , due to the constraint of confocality . indeed , by allowing @xmath96 , the inner boundary of the annulus ( where the dirichlet condition also applies ) degenerates to the inter - focal segment .",
    "the resulting flow field is therefore that one associated with an ellipse with semi - axes @xmath97 and @xmath98 , yet also containing a plate having width equal to the inter - focal distance @xmath39 .",
    "we now address the time - periodic elliptical case , by proposing a novel numerical method for its solution ( this is the main asset of the present study ) .",
    "more in detail , we firstly recall the solution of the inverse problem for the flow in the circle , so as to keep some degree of symmetry with section  [ sec_prob_staz ] .",
    "we then address the elliptical case , where we solve the inverse problem by exploiting relevant results , purposely introduced through an auxiliary , direct formulation .",
    "in particular , we accurately report the solution method for the simply connected elliptical cross - section .",
    "conversely , we omit details for the flow in the elliptical annulus between two confocal ellipses , since it can be derived from the previous case by a straightforward modification of the boundary conditions , as mentioned in section  [ subsub_ellip_annul ] ; corresponding numerical results are nonetheless reported in section  [ sec_res_csf ] , for the sake of completeness .",
    "let us preliminarily introduce the following @xmath99-periodic functions : @xmath100 the aforementioned works by sexl  @xcite and womersley  @xcite addressed the direct problem , that is with assigned pressure gradient @xmath101 .",
    "corresponding solution can be constructed as an infinite series of bessel functions @xmath102 of order zero ( womersley considered a single fourier mode , yet superposition can be invoked under the assumptions in  @xcite , since the corresponding sequence formally converges ) .",
    "as regards the inverse problem , an explicit map between the fourier coefficients of the velocity @xmath103 and those of the flow rate @xmath104 has been recently obtained by the authors  @xcite .",
    "relevant relations read @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the regularized confluent hyper - geometric function , and @xmath107 is a non - dimensional parameter which generalizes the classical womersley number .",
    "the explicit solution for the direct problem in an elliptical vessel was originally derived by khamrui  @xcite ( although some details were missing ) and verma  @xcite , following the same approach of womersley . in particular , given a single harmonic pressure gradient @xmath108 , with @xmath109 , the solution ( in elliptical coordinates ) is the following :    @xmath110    the functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 in   respectively denote the ordinary and modified mathieu functions  @xcite , while @xmath113 represent suitable constants , determined from the no - slip ( i.e. dirichlet ) boundary condition .",
    "it must be remarked that , despite the aforementioned functions were originally introduced by mathieu in the 19th century ( to study the vibration of an elliptical membrane , and they are still applied in the field  @xcite ) , they still deserve attention from a computational viewpoint , since their evaluation is prone to numerical instabilities  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order to get a @xmath53-periodic solution through the mathieu functions ( as in the present case ) , one needs to evaluate the eigenvalues of the laplacian : this involves infinite tridiagonal matrices and it is very expensive .",
    "furthermore , practical limitations on the ellipticity @xmath114 arise when directly using these special functions ; see e.g.  @xcite , where numerical instabilities are reported for @xmath115 ( besides interesting expressions for @xmath116 , that is for elliptical cross - sections degenerating to the circular geometry ) . in light of these points , the quest for robust numerical methods able to efficiently compute the mathieu functions",
    "is still an open issue , and positive contributions are being provided . in particular , a stepwise procedure is proposed in  @xcite , suitable for evaluating the mathieu functions in correspondence to large complex arguments typically associated with viscous flows .",
    "such a strategy exploits a proper blend of backward and forward recurrence techniques in order to enhance the convergence of the involved computations .    in order to circumvent the aforementioned limitations",
    ", we propose a novel numerical strategy , in the spirit of fourier analysis , which only involves the mathieu functions in an _",
    "indirect way_. in particular , we extend the approach introduced in  @xcite for the stationary case to the time - dependent one : our approach is based on a fourier analysis in the variables @xmath53 and @xmath117 , while the problem in the variable @xmath73 is kept in the physical space .",
    "more in detail , by applying the change of variables introduced in  , we firstly recast the time - dependent problem as follows : @xmath118 then , since we look for @xmath99-periodic solutions ( besides needing @xmath58-periodicity with respect to @xmath53 ) , we make the following _ ansatz _ of separation of variables for the velocity : @xmath119 hereafter considered in place of the corresponding one in  .",
    "furthermore , since we consider real - valued solutions , the following conditions immediately apply : @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( latter relation implies , in particular , @xmath123 ) .",
    "we then start by deliberately addressing a direct problem , hence by assuming a _ given _ pressure gradient . in order to stress the fact that we temporarily turn our attention to a direct problem",
    ", we introduce a minor notation change ( just within this section ) by denoting the pressure gradient as @xmath124 . by plugging   into",
    ", we arrive at the following problem : solve , for each @xmath125 , @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 defined as in  .",
    "the considered problem can be immediately simplified by invoking symmetry : velocity must be unchanged by the transformations @xmath129 and @xmath130 , i.e. by reflection over the ellipse axes of symmetry .",
    "this , by also recalling the above conditions on conjugacy , provides @xmath131 hence , we only need to solve the equations for the fourier modes @xmath132 , with @xmath133 both greater or equal to zero , with @xmath67 even .",
    "this permits to reduce by a factor eight the computational burden .",
    "that said , by plugging into   the fourier expansion of @xmath69 given in   and by equating the corresponding even @xmath67-modes ( at fixed @xmath134 ) , we obtain the following infinite family of ordinary differential equations @xmath135\\,\\widehat{u}_{m,0 }                     + \\frac { i \\ , \\mathrm{wo}^2_{a , m}}{2 } \\",

    "please also notice that @xmath139 , with @xmath140 introduced in   ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) . furthermore , as in the stationary case ,",
    "we need to assign an additional condition at @xmath52 ( where the change of coordinates becomes singular ) in order to have a well - posed mixed boundary value problems for @xmath132 . in particular , for the solution to be smooth also near @xmath52 , it is suitable to enforce symmetry for the velocity - profile , i.e. a vanishing velocity gradient normal to the inter - focal line .",
    "this reads ( cf .",
    "* eq .  ( 9 ) ) ) @xmath141 , that is @xmath142 .",
    "the equations   represent an infinite system of non - homogeneous mathieu ordinary differential equations . in order to get a computable system ,",
    "one main idea is to approximate such a system with a finite dimensional ( large enough ) system of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , this can not be achieved by simply neglecting all equations which involve modes @xmath132 for large enough @xmath143 , since there is an infinite coupling ( indeed , for each @xmath144 , the equation for @xmath67-th mode is coupled with those of the two closest modulo 2 @xmath67-modes , thus providing a tridiagonal system ) and such a rough simplification would lead to a system without solutions .",
    "the main idea in the present study is that higher frequencies are asymptotically small , since they are terms of a convergent fourier series .",
    "the fact that the series converges derives from the abstract results in  @xcite , which can be even simplified in the case of an assigned smooth and periodic pressure gradient .",
    "hence , by assuming that @xmath104 vanishes fast enough as @xmath145 ( and this is more than reasonable for realistic flows , see also section  [ sec_numtest ] ) , the assumed smallness of the higher modes is fully justified .",

    "having introduced the main ingredients , it is now possible to summarize the basic steps we propose for solving the inverse problem :    * we start by choosing a fluid ( thus the kinematic viscosity @xmath8 ) and the size ( namely @xmath138 and @xmath164 ) of the considered vessel cross - section .",
    "we also assume a _ given _ flow rate @xmath12 having period @xmath99 ; * we determine an integer @xmath187 such that the fourier spectrum of @xmath12 is suitably approximated by considering @xmath187 modes ; popular metrics ( e.g. the pearson correlation coefficient used in  @xcite ) can be used to the purpose .",

    "we conclude by adding two remarks on step ( s2 ) .",
    "firstly , to accomplish such a task , we need to solve the system   several times , namely for several @xmath165 .",
    "however , this burden is not specifically introduced by our strategy : for instance , to iterate computations up to reaching an adequate level of accuracy is also compulsory when directly using the mathieu functions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , our strategy ( which simply involves the solution of tridiagonal systems ) holds potential for a more computationally - efficient procedure than direct management of the mathieu functions .",
    "latter remark regards the introduction of @xmath162 .",
    "in particular , if one is interested in a single flow rate it makes sense to directly choose @xmath195 , so as to minimize computations .",
    "however , it can be of interest to also address multiple flow rate conditions , e.g. to identify the effect of specific @xmath134-harmonics on the solution ( this is of interest , for instance , for the development of pulsatility - based devices , as mentioned in section  [ sec_intro ] ) .",
    "in such a case , it is convenient to choose @xmath196 when taking step ( s2 ) , in particular by adopting an @xmath162 large enough to account for all the foreseen @xmath134-harmonic contributions .",
    "indeed , once built the corresponding @xmath155 `` basis '' , it is possible to immediately explore many solutions , by simply iterating steps ( s3)-(s4 ) in correspondence of any given set of @xmath104 coefficients .",
    "this leads to a very computationally - cheap procedure , since it is only required to evaluate some integrals , besides trivial summations .",
    "this aspect further supports the effective exploitability of the solution strategy we propose .",
    "the numerical strategy detailed in section  [ sec_inv_ellisse_unsteady ] is hereafter exemplified , based on measured data of blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) flow under physiological conditions . as anticipated in section  [ sec_intro ] , despite the exploitation of physiological flow conditions",
    ", the considered test - cases do not lay strong claims of being physiologically representative , due to the assumption of a fully - developed flow , which can be hardly fulfilled in real situations .",
    "main aim of such simulations is to quantitatively assess the gain in computational efficiency which is enabled by the proposed fourier - based numerical solution , as compared to more elaborate finite element solvers .",
    "this , in turn , renders our benchmark solution effectively usable for developing more ambitious numerical approaches , up to serving as a debugging tool for complex 3d codes .",
    "we point out that , besides the simulations described below , which are associated with mild eccentricity values ( above @xmath197 ) , we successfully manage to also apply our numerical strategy to more idealized geometries with eccentricity e.g. below @xmath198 , thus succeeding where previous approaches encountered difficulties  @xcite .",
    "however , corresponding numerical results are very similar to those reported in the sequel and therefore they are not reported , for ease of presentation .",

    "we are therefore aware of the fact that the solution we propose is hardly applicable to 3d finite - length complex domains ( such a limitation , despite being obvious , is often understated by the many authors who also assumed a fully - developed flow ) . on regard , under quite general assumptions ( yet still adopting an incompressible newtonian fluid ) , many valuable approaches for problems with flow rate conditions have been proposed in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and they are the subject of ongoing research . moreover , a fully numerical approach is the only viable when also considering non - newtonian fluids , already when tackling stationary problems ( possibly within curved or non - straight vessels as in  @xcite ) . nevertheless , and in spite of the linear context within which it was derived ,",
    "our solution to the considered inverse problem is original and non - trivial .",
    "indeed , it provides an easily computable benchmark ( as well as an approximation ) for such a problem . in particular , by invoking separation of variables ( in elliptical coordinates ) we obtained a tridiagonal system of linear , ordinary differential equations and we obtained the sought solution by means of a galerkin - type truncation .",
    "this method seem to theoretically corroborate the early attempts in  @xcite ( in which proper references to the inverse problem are missing ) .",
    "moreover , it represents an alternative to the numerical approach in  @xcite , heavily based on a wise computation strategy of the mathieu functions .",
    "indeed , truncation of the aforementioned system represents the differential counterpart of the truncation of the infinite dimensional algebraic linear system in  @xcite , which is performed in order to evaluate corresponding eigenvalues . in this sense",
    ", we only indirectly referred to mathieu functions , thus circumventing the numerical challenges associated therewith ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "as a consequence , even if the considered differential system is not completely integrable ( due to the coupling between fourier modes which is implied by the elliptical cross - section already when addressing the stationary problem ) , our solution can be easily computed , even for small ellipticity values . such an asset was shown through the numerical simulations reported in section  [ sec_numtest ] , based on measured flow rates for blood in the internal carotid artery ( ica ) , and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) flow in the upper cervical region of the human spine . indeed , despite being expected , the main advantage of the proposed method , as compared to fully numerical approaches , resides in computational efficiency : a speed - up over @xmath0 was obtained for both the aforementioned test - cases .",
    "such a gain is comparable with the one reported in  @xcite , even if simulation set - up times seem to be slightly understated therein ( in particular , computation of the mathieu functions was recognized as the most critical part , and several related convergence results are reported in such a valuable paper , yet at the same time corresponding computational burden was judged as inexpensive  @xcite ) .",
    "an additional , potential advantage of the proposed fourier - based approach resides in the possibility of an extensive and detailed control over numerical implementation ( as opposite to black - box libraries usually exploited for computing special functions ) , which could be further optimized e.g. by using consolidated techniques for fast fourier solvers  @xcite .",
    "these results effectively support the exploitation of the proposed method in a wider research scope , e.g. as a debugging tool and/or an improved source of boundary data for more ambitious numerical approaches , possibly based on more realistic data . on regard and with reference to the study of blood flow",
    ", the proposed solution could provide an enhanced inflow condition for those approaches which merely scale a ( steady ) parabolic solution by a factor accounting for flow rate variability ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the proposed solution can be directly used for computing wall shear stress distribution along the adopted cross - section boundary .",
    "indeed , vessel ellipticity affects such a stress  @xcite , which in turn has been identified as a key player in the onset and development of relevant pathologies likes atherosclerosis , even if several acquisitions needs to be consolidated ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , still within the context of bio - fluid dynamics , many investigations are being carried out for elucidating the role of csf dynamics within human spine , in relation to the onset and progression of relevant diseases like syringomyelia .",
    "the proposed benchmark flow holds potential for application to such studies as well , in particular for assigning more accurate inflow / initial conditions in the cervical portion of the spinal fluid domain ( which is usually described as a circular annulus between two finite - length , compliant cylinders  @xcite ; wave propagation is usually studied therein ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that relevant investigations for such fluid - structure interaction problems are being performed in the context of hemodynamics as well ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , besides studies purely focusing on fluid dynamics , the proposed solution can be effectively applied to additional biomedical applications ( as anticipated , the biomedical field is an elective application domain , since flow rate is a main available physical datum ) , e.g. to targeted delivery problems .",
    "for instance , the effect of flow pulsatility on magnetic particle targeting was originally exemplified in  @xcite , in order to highlight peculiar effects with respect to the stationary case  @xcite widely adopted when addressing particle targeting in blood capillaries .",
    "such an enhancement straightforwardly applies to magnetoresponsive carriers at large , e.g. to the controlled navigation of mri - guided microrobots in the vasculature  @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a growing interest in the robotic field for the development of micro / miniaturized interventional tools to be navigated ( e.g. through magnetic fields ) within bodily fluids .",
    "these systems , currently defined as microrobots  @xcite despite their intrinsic simplicity ( system compartmentalization is indeed almost inapplicable at the micro scale ) , hold potential for effective application to medical fields , and both blood flow and csf flow were identified as elective carrying fluids . to further support this point",
    ", it is worth mentioning that , besides carrier transport along the mainstream , active microrobot navigation was also proposed , e.g. in the csf flow . more precisely , magnetic navigation of helical microrobots was proposed for application in the spinal csf  @xcite ( being the helical shape inspired by the propulsion strategy of bacterial flagella , well suited for low - reynolds - number regimes ) .",
    "interestingly , relevant csf velocity profile , together with corresponding fluidic actions on the microrobot , seem to be slightly overlooked in these studies ( while attention is payed to other physical aspects , up to gravity , in spite of its minor effects at the micro scale  @xcite ) .",
    "this seems to be partly due to the lack of easily computable - yet physically derived - flow conditions ; such an issue might be mitigated by our benchmark flow solution , thus contributing to better assess the feasibility of such long - term approaches in bodily fluids , even if still in a simplified context .",
    "finally , an additional , remarkable application field has been recently identified , namely the one of energy harvesting from bodily fluids .",
    "indeed , use of magnetic fields was proposed as a key powering strategy for most of the aforementioned microrobots , mainly in response to the impossibility of using on - board batteries at the micro scale ( alternative approaches based on harnessing the power of biological entities like bacteria were also proposed , yet their discussion is out of the present scope ) .",
    "in fact , powering ( closely linked to actuation ) appears as the real bottleneck currently hampering microrobotic applications , and energy harvesting holds promise to solve such a major issue . in this spirit",
    "yet in the wider context of implantable miniaturized electronic devices for biomedical applications , an implantable fuel cell has been recently proposed  @xcite , powered through energy scavenging from the csf .",
    "relevant estimates are reported in the cited reference in order to assess powering effective sustainability ( they address oxygen and glucose transport within the csf domain , mainly in the brain region but also encompassing the spinal one ) .",
    "however , it is expressly recognized in  @xcite that a deeper insight into the actual csf dynamics is required to accurately assess the performance of the proposed system .",
    "such a quest further supports the development of modeling strategies for the csf flow ( yet such a point can be immediately extended to other fluid conditions ) , and the benchmark flow solution we propose , despite the inherent simplifications we repeatedly pointed out above , could contribute to take a leap ahead in many of the aforementioned applications areas .    to conclude , while developing the proposed numerical method we deliberately sacrificed some degree of physiological representativeness , yet in the name of direct and efficient computability , and thus wider usability of the obtained benchmark flow solution .",
    "the many applications discussed above encourage to exploit our solution in an wide interdisciplinary context , so as to further push the corresponding scientific and technological frontiers .",
