    "cholesteric liquid crystals are composed of chiral molecules that favor a helical twist in their equilibrium state . because the helical pitch is typically comparable to the wavelength of visible light , cholesterics are useful as optical devices , e.g. , as displays  @xcite or in mirrorless lasing  @xcite .",
    "cholesteric elastomers have recently attracted theoretical and experimental interest for their novel optical and mechanical properties .",
    "cholesteric elastomers consist of either intrinsically chiral polymers crosslinked to form a gel  @xcite or nematic polymers crosslinked in the presence of a chiral solvent which when removed leaves an imprinted helical texture in the gel  @xcite . as in the case of conventional cholesteric liquids ,",
    "the helical pitch in the elastomers is comparable to the wavelength of visible light ; as a result cholesteric elastomers possess a photonic band gap , which may be mechanically tuned to useful advantage in waveguiding and lasing applications  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of a cholesteric elastomer under mechanical strain has been studied both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "this problem bears some similarity to that of a cholesteric liquid in a magnetic or electric field  @xcite .",
    "if a magnetic field is applied to a cholesteric liquid perpendicular to the cholesteric pitch axis , then as the field is increased the pitch increases and twist walls begin to appear with a spacing equal to the pitch .",
    "the pitch ( and thus the separation of the twist walls ) diverges at a critical value of the magnetic field .",
    "however , in the case of a cholesteric elastomer while twist walls also appear if a strain is applied perpendicular to the pitch axis , the helical texture imprinted at the time of crosslinking in an elastomer  @xcite prevents long wavelength distortions that would increase the pitch .",
    "instead , the material shrinks along the pitch axis thereby reducing the pitch .",
    "if the frank energy associated with gradients of the director field is ignored , then the cholesteric twist is eliminated at a critical value of the strain by abrupt reversals of the twist walls which are of zero width at the critical strain  @xcite .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the frank energy can be ignored because in a typical cholesteric elastomer the length scale at which the frank energy is comparable to the elastic energy is very small compared to the pitch .",
    "thus , except for values of the strain very close to the critical value needed to unwind the helix , it is reasonable to ignore frank elasticity .",
    "however , if the shear modulus of the elastomer is reduced or if the distribution of nematic polymer chains is made more isotropic , then frank elasticity can have significant effects .",
    "in any case , independent of material parameters the frank energy will become infinite as the width of the twist walls approach zero at the transition to the untwisted state .",
    "thus , to fully understand the nature of the transition from the helical to the untwisted ( i.e. , nematic ) state , the effects of frank elasticity must be considered . in this paper",
    "we study theoretically the effect of frank elasticity on this transition by minimizing the energy of a cholesteric elastomer including the frank energy .",
    "inclusion of the frank energy leads not surprisingly to twist walls of finite width at the transition ( and thus a lower value of the critical strain ) .",
    "furthermore , frank elasticity leads to the metastability of the helical state above the transition , raising the question of how the topologically stable helical twist is removed .",
    "we explore this question by considering the mechanism first proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely , the nucleation of twist disclination loops in the planes of the twist walls .",
    "a similar mechanism was analyzed by friedel and de gennes @xcite in the case of a cholesteric liquid in a magnetic field . if the initial field strength is large enough so that the material is in the nematic state ( i.e. , the helix is unwound ) , then as the field is reduced to a value less than critical field , the nematic state becomes metastable , and the equilibrium cholesteric phase is nucleated by the creation of a twist disclination loop .",
    "friedel and de gennes carried out an approximate analytic calculation of the critical radius and activation energy of such a loop .",
    "we consider a similar approximate calculation here .",
    "the main drawback to this approximate calculation is that we assume that the strain field in the elastomer is spatially uniform .",
    "we improve upon this calculation by carrying out a finite element method ( fem ) analysis which allows us to minimize the elastomer energy with respect to variations in both the director field and the rubber elastic degrees of freedom .",

    "<S> the application of a sufficiently strong strain perpendicular to the pitch axis of a monodomain cholesteric elastomer unwinds the cholesteric helix . </S>",
    "<S> previous theoretical analyses of this transition ignored the effects of frank elasticity which we include here . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the strain needed to unwind the helix is reduced because of the frank penalty and the cholesteric state becomes metastable above the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we consider in detail a previously proposed mechanism by which the topologically stable helical texture is removed in the metastable state , namely by the nucleation of twist disclination loops in the plane perpendicular to the pitch axis . </S>",
    "<S> we present an approximate calculation of the barrier energy for this nucleation process which neglects possible spatial variation of the strain fields in the elastomer , as well as a more accurate calculation based on a finite element modeling of the elastomer . </S>"
