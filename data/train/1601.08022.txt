    "dynamics of quantum systems with the states frequently monitored by a measurement apparatus can be rather controversial and is a subject of constant interest over the years @xcite .",
    "every measurement in the measurement sequence may be tuned to cause only a partial collapse of the system s wavefunction , with the collapse effect being arbitrary weak ( so called `` weak measurements '' ) @xcite . in another context ,",
    "the term `` weak measurement '' was introduced by aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav ) @xcite as being attributed to a measurement of a continuous degree of freedom ( e.  g. an electron position ) coupled to a discrete one ( spin ) via post - selection .",
    "these two approaches were recently shown to be equivalent @xcite . as a result of",
    "repetitive application of weak measurements  the situation which is sometimes reffered to as weak zeno measurements ( wzm )  a kind of stochastic `` quantum trajectory '' arises @xcite due to unpredictable character of every particular measurement outcome .    just repeating the weak measurements , without any further action on the system , allows to control the system state in various ways .",
    "for instance , one can achieve an arbitrary state from any other one by repeating weak measurements in different bases @xcite .",
    "alternatively , by allowing the strength of the weak measurements ( in aav sense ) to depend on the spatial coordinate , one can create a `` potential wall '' which may reflect a particle @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if we repeat a weak measurement of a single qubit in a fixed basis , the resulting dynamics was up to now believed to be very trivial .",
    "the resulting quantum trajectory just stochastically approaches one of the two qubit s basis states @xmath0 or @xmath1 . in this article",
    "we add a new dimension to this seemingly trivial dynamics by allowing the measurement strength to be changed in time and in a state - conditional way .",
    "we observe that the stochastic equations , describing quantum trajectories in such simple one - dimensional system are in fact quite similar to the ones describing motion of a small brownian particle in a fluid flow ( overdamped brownian motion ) @xcite .",
    "one of the striking phenomena in such flows as well as in many other stochastic systems are so called stochastic ratchets .",
    "namely , by varying the potential acting on the brownian particle in time and/or space in a periodic way , it is possible to create an effective additional force , despite the potential introduces no average force @xcite .",
    "such ratchets are encountered in many stochastic systems of different nature @xcite .",
    "brownian ratchets are deeply connected to so called parrondo games , when two or more lossy games are combined to give a winning one @xcite .",
    "very recently , the notion of weak parrondo games and weak brownian ratchets were introduced in @xcite to describe the situation when two or more lossy games are combined to give just less lossy ( but not winning ) one .",
    "we remark that , although both parrondo games and brownian ratchets were considered in context of quantum systems @xcite , this was up to now done via some direct action on the system itself .",
    "in contrast , in the present article the situation of control - without - direct - action will be discussed .",
    "here we show how the effective potential arising in wzm dynamics can be modified by changing the strength of the measurement periodically in time and in a state - conditioned fashion ( that is , in dependence on the current system state ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the stochastic ratchet effect , albeit weak , is possible in such situation .",
    "we also demonstrate an another interesting effect , namely dynamic localization of the state in the case when the measurement strength nearly vanishes at some particular system state . as a limiting case for this behaviour ,",
    "a `` false basis state '' may appear , which `` attracts '' the stochastic trajectories in similar way as the true basis states do .",
