    "the recent progress in the experimental and theoretical work with engineered optical media has made it possible to emulate , by means of the optical - beam propagation , a wide range of physical effects which were originally predicted or experimentally discovered in other areas of physics . in many cases ,",
    "the optical emulation offers a possibility to study the effect in question in a pure form , which is often too difficult in the original setting .",
    "in other cases , specially designed optical configurations open a way to demonstrate realizations of the effects in forms which are impossible in the source systems . belonging to this class of optically emulated phenomena are the parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry @xcite , based on the paraxial beam propagation in optical media with symmetrically placed gain and loss elements , as predicted theoretically @xcite and realized experimentally @xcite ; anderson localization in random photonic media @xcite ; and the photonic emulation of topological insulators @xcite and graphene opt - graphene . a recent addition to this topic",
    "is a proposal to implement the mechanism of the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , previously elaborated in terms of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , in dual - core optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "basic schemes of  grafting \" new physical effects to optics make use of linear beam - propagation regimes . however , the ubiquitous kerr nonlinearity of optical materials , as well as other types of the optical nonlinear response , suggest one to consider implementation of the new effects in a nonlinear form .",
    "a well - known example is provided by @xmath1-symmetric solitons , which have been studied in detail theoretically pt - sol - theory and created in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the optical emulation of the soc was also developed in the context of the nonlinear propagation and formation of solitons @xcite .    as a further development in these directions",
    ", it may be interesting to design optical settings which combine the above - mentioned effects , that would be difficult to achieve in their original realizations .",
    "the objective of the present work is to elaborate one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) optical systems , based on dual - core waveguides , which make it possible to blend the soc and @xmath0-symmetry mechanisms .",
    "the use of couplers for this purpose is natural , as they provide photonic platforms for the emulation of both the soc and @xmath0 symmetry in 1d opt - soc-1d , radik and 2d @xcite geometries alike . as an additional result of the analysis , a new 1d conservative model for two - component gap solitons",
    "is produced , which admits exact solutions , and demonstrates a nontrivial internal stability boundary in the soliton family .",
    "new dynamical features are revealed by the analysis of the combined models , such as a nonmonotonous dependence of the stability area of 1d @xmath0-symmetric solitons on the soc strength , @xmath2 : the area originally shrinks but then strongly expands with the increase of @xmath2 .",
    "another noteworthy finding is that the soc terms stabilize 2d @xmath0-symmetric solitons under the action of the cubic self - attraction , in spite of the simultaneous presence of _ two _ mechanisms driving the catastrophic instability in the 2d system : the possibility of the breakup of the @xmath0 symmetry , i.e. , failure of the gain - loss balance pt - optics , pt - sol - theory , and the onset of the critical collapse induced by the kerr nonlinearity @xcite ( the latter may also take place in the presence of soc @xcite ) .",
    "the latter result implies extension of the soc - induced stabilization of 2d solitons ( _ semi - vortices _ and _ mixed modes _ ) in the free space with the cubic self - attraction , that was demonstrated recently @xcite .",

    "the present analysis may be extended in other directions .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to consider the mobility of 1d and 2d solitons and collisions between them , which is a nontrivial problem in the presence of the soc we .",
    "dynamical regimes , such as josephson - like oscillations of localized modes between the coupled cores , may be interesting too .",

    "<S> we introduce a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system , which can be implemented in dual - core planar optical couplers with the kerr nonlinearity in its cores , making it possible to blend effects of the @xmath0 symmetry , represented by balanced linear gain and loss in the two cores , and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , emulated by a spatially biased coupling between the cores . </S>",
    "<S> families of 1d and 2d solitons and their stability boundaries are identified . in the 1d setting , the soc leads , at first , to shrinkage of the stability area for @xmath0-symmetric solitons , which is followed by its rapid expansion . </S>",
    "<S> 2d solitons have their stability region too , in spite of the simultaneous action of two major destabilizing factors , _ </S>",
    "<S> viz_. , the collapse driven by the kerr nonlinearity and a trend towards spontaneous breakup of the gain - loss balance . in the limit of the soc terms dominating over the intrinsic diffraction , </S>",
