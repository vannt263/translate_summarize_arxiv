    "one of the main motivations for measuring the binary fraction of stars is to better understand the process of star formation itself .",
    "after all , stars like our own sun are preferentially produced in multiple systems @xcite .",
    "the classic stellar formation mechanism of molecular cloud core collapse and fragmentation , however , has a hard time explaining the tightest systems .",
    "while this mechanism can explain wide binary systems ( semimajor axis @xmath13au ) , it has some difficulties explaining the formation of tight systems @xcite . additionally",
    ", the multiplicities of the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs appear to be statistically different from those of more massive systems ( @xcite and references within ) . these differences , if proven to be real , provide important clues and constraints to theoretical stellar formation models .    the continuously improving statistics of binary stars brings clarity to the paradigm that the binary fraction and semimajor axis distribution are functions of the central star mass . surveys of g dwarfs estimate a multiplicity fraction of approximately 50@xmath14 for separations of 3au and greater @xcite . other surveys of similar sensitivity to systems wider than 3au have found that early m dwarfs ( m0-m4 ) have measured binary fractions of @xmath15 @xcite while late m / early l dwarfs ( m8.0-l0.5 ) estimate fractions @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the trend appears to continue to the coolest objects - l dwarfs reporting @xmath17 - 15@xmath14 @xcite and t dwarfs at @xmath18 @xcite . the same surveys infer semimajor - axis separations to also be a function of primary mass .",
    "while g and early m dwarfs ( m0-m4 ) show broad separation peaks of @xmath19au , late m ( @xmath20m8 ) , l , and t dwarfs appear to have separations tightly peaked at @xmath21au @xcite .",
    "a similar result has been shown to apply to the sequence of members in the pleiades cluster , from solar - type stars to brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "together , these results are providing both clues and empirical constraints on star formation mechanisms as well as potentially help calibrate the mass - age - luminosity relation for very low - mass ( vlm ) stars .    in @xcite",
    ", hereafter referred to as paper i , we presented results from the largest flux limited ( k@xmath0mag ) survey of nearby field m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs .",
    "the binary fraction of this narrowly defined spectral type range had not been quantified as those of stars slightly earlier ( m0-m4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and later ( m8-l0.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering the differences in binary charactersitics as a function of mass as discussed above , would m6.0-m7.5 binaries have intermediary characteristics to their main sequence neighbors or would they resemble the ultracool dwarfs ?",
    "paper i s sample consisted of 30 stars and presented the discovery of three new binary systems using the university of hawaii visitor ao system hokupaa @xcite at the gemini north telescope .",
    "the discoveries followed characteristics of other vlm binary systems , namely relatively equal mass components ( q@xmath220.8 ) with projected separations less than 16au . in this paper",
    "we present our two latest binary discoveries from this spectral range , 2massi j0429184 - 312356 and 2massi j1847034 + 552243 , hereafter referred to as 2m0429 and 2m1847 .",
    "these binaries were discovered with the vlt and the subaru ao facilities , respectively .",
    "the total m6.0-m7.5 sample size is increased to 36 and we update the binary fraction results with those presented in paper i. we present our observations and results in the following section and examine the systems derived characteristics such as distance , age , temperature , spectral type , and mass in  3 . in  4 we conclude by discussing the binary frequency and separation distribution of m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs .",
    "we selected a flux - limited sample of 36 objects consisting of m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs with k@xmath0mag and j - k@xmath23mag from mainly 2mass stars listed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "paper i discusses the first 30 observations and we report here the most recent 6 . one of the 6 targets is a recently discovered high proper motion m dwarf - so 025300.5 + 165258 ( @xmath24pc away ; * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss this star further in  2.5 .",
    "we also note that we observed at subaru on 2003 july 10 ( ut ) another recently - discovered high proper motion m dwarf 2massi j1835379 + 325954 ( @xmath25pc away ; * ? ? ?",
    "while not part of this sample due to its later spectral type ( m8 ) , it was observed at high resolution and found to have no q@xmath26 companions at separations @xmath27 .",
    "the 30 targets from paper i were all observed at the gemini north telescope .",
    "the 6 targets presented here were observed at the subaru and vlt observatories . due to its recent discovery and proximity , we conducted additional long integrations of so 025300.5 + 165258 with the keck ii telescope .",
    "interestingly , the ao systems at these telescopes represent the three major wavefront sensor ( wfs ) technologies currently in use today .",
    "gemini north , at the time of our observations , and subaru , currently , use 36-element curvature wfss , the vlt has an infra - red shack - hartman , and the keck ii utilizes a visible shack - hartman .",
    "this survey provided the opportunity to compare and contrast how different ao wfss differ in their abilities to lock on faint targets .",
    "as discussed in detail in paper i , one of the challenges in utilizing ao is locating sufficiently bright guide stars near enough one s science objects to minimize uncertainty in the image quality introduced by isoplanicity .",
    "this is best achieved when using the target object itself as the ao guide star .",
    "this shifts the criterion of target selection from the availability of bright natural guide stars ( r@xmath2815mag ) to the sensitivity of the respective telescope s ao system , in particular the wfs .",
    "this becomes quite important because the probability of locating a r=15mag star within 30of one s science target is only about @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "3.10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ability to guide on fainter stars also allows for both larger sample sizes and improved contrast ratios .",
    "we were able to observe the faintest of our targets ( v@xmath2919.0 - 19.5mag , i@xmath2915.5 - 16mag ) only with the former gemini north ao system hokupaa where we conducted the majority of the observations .",
    "no other current ao system can lock onto such faint targets .",
    "hokupaa , decommisioned in 2003 , was a curvature - based ao system which employed in its wfs red - sensitive , photon - counting avalanche photodiodes with effectively zero read - noise .",
    "consequently , this type of sensor is ideally suited for guiding on intrinsically faint objects as long as they are relatively red ( v - i@xmath21mag ) .",
    "the keck ii telescope with a more traditional shack - hartman wfs allows for improved angular resolution with higher obtainable strehl ratios but requires brighter targets ( v@xmath30mag ) .",
    "we compare and contrast the performance of these two types of wfs technologies in @xcite . at both subaru and the vlt",
    "we were able to lock on our faint low mass targets with i@xmath31mag ( k@xmath32mag )      the two discovered binary systems , 2m0429 and 2m1847 , were detected at the vlt and subaru observatories on 2003 february 13 ( ut ) and 2003 july 10 ( ut ) , respectively .",
    "a total of 6 dwarfs from our sample were observed during these two runs .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] lists the 4 low - mass dwarfs observed with no likely physical companion detections between @xmath33 - 15@xmath34 . for completeness",
    "we also include the 27 single stars observed in paper i. table [ tbl-2 ] lists the observable properties of the 2 new binary systems along with the 3 systems presented in paper i. target stars were considered `` observed '' when a minimum corrected fwhm of @xmath35 in h band was achieved .",
    "each of the observations were made by dithering over 4 different quadrant positions on the infrared camera detector .",
    "for all targets we obtained both unsaturated h or k@xmath36 images ( @xmath37s , `` short '' images ) , depending on seeing conditions , and saturated h images ( 30s , `` deep '' images ) to gain sensitivity to potential faint companions .    at subaru",
    "we used the coronagraphic imager with ao ( ciao ) without using the coronagraphic mask feature .",

    "naco is unique in that it utilizes an infrared wfs .",
    "we found that the infrared wfs was most efficient for objects with k@xmath4011.2mag . for 2m0429",

    "the images were reduced using an ao data reduction pipeline written in the iraf language as first described in @xcite .",
    "the pipeline produces final unsaturated exposures in j , h , and k@xmath36 with deep 720s exposures at h band for each observed binary system .",
    "the dithering of the shorter exposures produces a final 30@xmath41 image with a high s / n region in a 10@xmath42 box centered on the binary . in order to detect close companions within 1@xmath34 of the central star we filter out the low spatial frequency components of the deep images leaving behind high frequency residuals in the psf ( unsharp masking ) . no faint companions , however , were found within the halo of our central stars using this technique .",

    "photometry for the more widely separated",
    "2m0429 was performed using the daophot psf fitting photometry package in iraf .",
    "the psfs used were unsaturated single stars observed during the same night with similar ir brightness , spectral type , and air mass .",
    "the errors in @xmath4mag , listed in table [ tbl-2 ] , are the differences in the photometry between 2 similar psf stars .",
    "daophot could not successfully separate the strongly blended components of 2m1847 due to lower strehl ratios caused by observing through a 1.4 airmass ( the strehl ratio and hence resolution were better at airmass of 1 when the binary was initially discovered and its components more clearly separated , however , technical difficulties resulted in delayed image acquisition ) .",
    "consequently , we remove the low spatial frequencies of the binary revealing their high - frequency cores .",
    "we then perform aperture photometry using iraf phot .",
    "this purely differential technique preserves the relative magnitude difference between each component while removing sufficient primary halo flux to reveal the companion centroids in k@xmath36 .",
    "the technique gave reliable @xmath4mags and was verified on binary images with known @xmath4mags .",
    "we calculate individual fluxes and their uncertainties from the measured binary flux ratios and the integrated 2mass apparent magnitudes ( 2mass all - sky point source catalog ) , along with their respective uncertainties .",
    "table [ tbl-3 ] lists the photometry and derived characteristics of the new binary systems .",
    "one of our targets observed to have no stellar companions deserves special mention . 2m02530084 + 1652532 ( hereafter 2m0253 ) is a newly discovered m6.5 dwarf @xcite remarkably only 3.6pc away .",
    "it was discovered from a search of the skymorph database of the near earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) project @xcite as a high proper motion object ( 5@xmath34yr@xmath39 ) .",
    "the star s proximity presented a rare observational window for the direct imaging of several jupiter - mass , extrasolar planets .",
    "we were able to both probe semimajor axis separations to within @xmath293au of the star , comparable to the separations of known extrasolar planets detected through radial velocity studies ( a@xmath43au ; http://exoplanets.org ) _ and _ outside the speckle - dominated region on the detector ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we were the first to observe this object with high resolution on 2003 july 14 ( ut ) using the nirc2 camera and ao @xcite on the w. m. keck ii telescope .",
    "the 0@xmath45pixel@xmath39 plate scale mode was used on the 1024@xmath381024 pixel array .",
    "2m0253 was only observable for approximately 1 hour in the early morning .",
    "we achieved sensitivity to companions of h=19.6 at 1@xmath46 in 24min of total integration time ( 49@xmath3830s frames in a 4-dither pattern ) .",
    "we fully saturated the central star so as to allow for the detection of any massive faint jupiter planets orbiting @xmath47au ) from the central star .",
    "no faint companions were detected .",
    "the 24min of total integration time enables us to establish upper limits on planetary masses orbiting this star .",
    "we construct an unsaturated psf of the star by replacing the saturated core with scaled unsaturated pixels from a short exposure .",
    "we determine maximum h band @xmath4mag contrasts by combining scaled models of faint companions ( with appropriate psfs ) at various radial distances until a 5@xmath48 detection is obtained .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the resulting 5@xmath48 limiting magnitudes at several radial distances from the central star .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines indicate the h band @xmath4mag required for the detection of 5gyr , 10m@xmath49 and 25m@xmath49 objects using the models of @xcite .",
    "we use the peak of their h band spectra to estimate the flux emission in this exercise .",
    "the star s age is not known but based on its high tangential velocity we can assume it is an older object @xcite .",
    "the figure demonstrates sensitivity to an 11 jupiter - mass extrasolar planet at only @xmath504au ( 1.5@xmath34 ) away . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the fully reduced keck image of 2m0253 spatially filtered of its low frequency halo , leaving behind high frequency residuals in the core ( superspeckles ) .",
    "this image also illustrates that with conventional ao , speckle noise limits the detection of faint companions within the inner @xmath51 of the halo .",
    "from the total of 69 objects already observed in both this survey and a companion survey of m8.0-l0.5 stars by the authors @xcite , we did not detect any additional unknown red ( j - k@xmath52mag ) background objects in @xmath53 square arcsec .",
    "therefore , we estimate the probability of a chance projection of a comparably red object within 0.5@xmath34 of the primary to be @xmath54 . as we argued in paper i , with an m6-m8 dwarf density of 0.007pc@xmath55 in the local solar neighborhood @xcite , the probability of an apparent companion being just a background star at , for example , twice the distance of the target star ( hence fainter by a @xmath4 magnitude of 1.5 mag ) _ and _ appearing within @xmath56 of any of our targets is estimated to only be @xmath57 .",
    "additionally , none of the companion images appear spatially extended as might be expected of background galaxies .",
    "therefore , we conclude that both of the very red companions are physically associated with their primaries and hereafter we will refer to them as 2m0429b and 2m1847b",
    ".      neither of the 2 binary systems have published trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "we estimate distances to both primaries from a color - magnitude diagram developed in paper i based on trigonometric parallaxes of other well - studied , late - m , field dwarfs from @xcite . using corresponding 2mass photometry for each star with a trigonometric parallax",
    ", we estimated a linear least - squares fit of m@xmath58(j - k@xmath59 for the spectral range m6.5-l1 .",
    "this relationship has a 1@xmath48 error of 0.33 mag , which has been added in quadrature to the j and k@xmath36 photometric errors to yield the primarys m@xmath60 values reported in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we then use the distance modulus of the primary to estimate the distances to the binaries .",
    "the calculated distances are listed in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we do not have spatially resolved spectra of the individual components in either of the 2 new systems .",
    "we estimate the spectral types of each of the binary components by using the relation spt = 3.54m@xmath60 - 27.20 derived in paper i from the data set of @xcite ( eg .",
    "spt=8 is an m8 , spt=10 is an l0 , etc ) .",
    "this relationship has a 1@xmath48 error of 0.85 spectral types which when taken in quadrature with the uncertainty in m@xmath60 gives an overall uncertainty of about 1.5 spectral types .",
    "fortunately , none of analysis is dependent on these spectral type estimates .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "effective temperatures of the binary components are estimated from the dusty evolutionary tracks @xcite using calculated m@xmath60 values and estimated ages ( see figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we estimate 2m0429a and 2m0429b to have effective temperatures of 2690@xmath61k and 2240@xmath62k , respectively ; 2m1847a and 2m1847b are estimated at 2760@xmath63k and 2690@xmath64k , respectively .",
    "these estimated temperatures are in very good agreement with those predicted in @xcite for the given spectral types .      estimating the age of late - type field dwarfs without li measurements or established cluster membership is difficult .",
    "consequently , we conservatively assume a mean age of @xmath9 gyr for our objects with uncertainty spanning the range of common ages in the solar neighborhood ( 0.6 - 7.5 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to estimate masses of these objects we rely on luminosity - mass - age models for vlm stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "we utilize the dusty models to provide theoretical estimates for both stellar and substellar masses as a function of both absolute k@xmath36 magnitude and age .",
    "the tracks are calibrated for the k@xmath36 bandpass ( i. baraffe , private communication ) and we extrapolate the isochrones from 0.10 to 0.11m@xmath8 so as to enclose the upper mass limits of our central stars .",
    "the companion s absolute magnitude is simply determined by adding the measured @xmath4k@xmath36 to its primary star s m@xmath60 .",
    "the crosses in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] indicate the best estimates of where the binary components lie on the 5gyr tracks and their uncertainties are represented by the shaded regions .",
    "2m0429a s region of uncertainty is displayed in the upper right while its companion is displayed in the lower left . because the 2m1847 binary system is of near equal magnitudes , their regions of uncertainty largely overlap . in this case",
    "the slightly more massive primary s region of uncertainty is indicated in bold outline and the portion of the companion s not overlapping is dashed .",
    "the maximum mass is related to the minimum m@xmath60 at the oldest possible age ; the minimum mass is related to the maximum m@xmath60 at the youngest possible age .",
    "table [ tbl-3 ] lists the estimated masses for both binary systems .",
    "both systems primary masses are consistent with m7-type dwarfs and their secondaries are most likely stellar , however , 2m0429b s uncertainties extend well into the substellar region according to the model . the uncertainty in the masses , as well as in the effective temperatures ,",
    "is largely driven by the uncertainty in our determination of m@xmath60 ( @xmath48=0.33 mag ) as obtained from the [ m@xmath60,j - k@xmath65 color magnitude diagram linear fit from paper i. future observations of trigonometric parallaxes would significantly reduce the uncertainty in m@xmath60 and hence the masses and temperatures .",
    "we update the binary fraction statistics of m6.0-m7.5 stars combining the latest results presented here ( 2 binaries resolved out of 6 ) with those from paper i ( 3 binaries out of 30 ) .",
    "this implies an observed , uncorrected binary fraction of 14@xmath66 using a poisson distribution for the uncertainty @xcite .",
    "however , this sample was originally drawn from a magnitude - limited sample and hence the observed binary fraction is biased due to the leakage of equal magnitude binaries into our sample from further distances ( malmquist bias ) .",
    "we therefore need to correct our result due to this bias as well as consider sample incompleteness due to undetected very tight lower mass companions .    to compensate for the fainter single stars not included in our flux - limited sample we first adjust for a larger observed volume due to the discovered binaries by a volume correction factor .",
    "this factor is simply the ratio of the spherical volume containing 95% of our detected binaries and the spherical volume containing 95% of our target objects .",
    "this results in a volume correction factor of ( 30pc/24pc)@xmath67=2 and a malmquist - corrected binary fraction of @xmath68 or 7@xmath69 .",
    "the possibility that there were faint companions , both stellar and non - stellar , not detected due to instrument insensitivity is a real one .",
    "the curve in figure [ fig6 ] shows the instrumental sensitivity of our sample in the speckle noise limited region ( @xmath70 , 30au for a star assumed 30pc away ) as a function of mass ratio and projected separation in au .",
    "it is based on modelling of a 5gyr ( typical of the ages expected for field stars",
    "@xcite ) , m6.5 dwarf placed at 30pc ( typical of the distances of our discovered binaries ) observed at the 8-m gemini north telescope .",
    "we use the dusty models to convert @xmath4h magnitudes to mass ratios .",
    "the reason we convert to mass ratios is because it allows us to use the observed mass ratio distribution for vlm binaries @xcite to predict the number of missed companions with q@xmath71 .",
    "the 5 large asterisks in figure [ fig6 ] represent the 5 discovered binary systems from this survey .",
    "interestingly , they are all found in the upper left corner of the sensitivity curve .",
    "the fact that some are so near the curve strongly infers that binaries just below the sensitivity curve were most likely missed .    to apply an instrument - sensitivity correction we need to estimate how many binaries went undetected in our sample .",
    "we generate a monte carlo simulation of 11670 synthetic companions with the binary properties of vlm systems . for our model",
    "we use the mass ratio and separation distributions for vlm binaries and assume that the distributions are independent . for the mass ratio distribution",
    "we assume a power law decline from unity to 0.6 from @xcite .",
    "we create the separation distribution profile by plotting the 42 most tightly separated and resolved vlm ( m@xmath7m@xmath8 ) binaries currently known ( see figure [ fig7 ] ; table 4 ) .",
    "originally presented in @xcite , we update the list of all known vlm binaries and present it in table 4 .",
    "the definition of vlm binary having a total mass of @xmath720.19m@xmath8 is selected to ensure that the binary components are of spectral type m6.0 or later and hence differentiated from more massive systems .",
    "the peak of this distribution , @xmath9au , is much tighter than the @xmath19au distribution peak of slightly more massive m0-m4 dwarfs @xcite and solar - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the separation distribution is bound by the smallest separation the instruments were able to obtain in h band ( @xmath73pc ) on the near side and the empirically sampled wider separation encompassing 95% of known vlm binaries ( table 4 ) on the far side .    from this sample of nearly 12,000 simulated companions ,",
    "21% were below the instrument sensitivity curve ( but above the instrument sensitivity mass ratio cutoff of q=0.6 ) as shown in figure [ fig6 ] . with 5 detected binaries ,",
    "this predicts 1.3 companions were missed in our survey .",
    "hence we conclude that the binary fraction for m6.0-m7.5 stars is ( 5 + 1.3)/36/2 or 9@xmath10 .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the true fraction is most certainly larger than this figure since we can not rule out the possibility of the existence of low q binaries due to the sensitivity of this survey .",
    "therefore , our reported binary fraction , accurate within the uncertainties for m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs for separations @xmath74 3au , represents a low - end estimate to the intrinsic binary fraction .    with slightly improved statistics ,",
    "this latest result for the binary fraction of m6.0-m7.5 stars is now more comparable with those of later spectral types : 15@xmath75 for late m / early l dwarfs @xcite , 10 - 15@xmath14 and 15@xmath76 for l dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) and 9@xmath77 for t dwarfs @xcite .",

    "i is strengthened : _ for spectral type m6.0-m7.5 binary systems with separations 3au@xmath72a@xmath79300au the binary fraction from our survey is 9@xmath10 , statistically consistent with cooler m , l , and t stars and significantly less common than that of g and early m stars .",
