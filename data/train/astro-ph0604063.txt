    "galaxy environment has a fundamental role in the evolutionary paths followed by galaxies .",
    "it is well known that galaxy populations change according to the environment in which they are found .",
    "the most classical evidence of such environmental dependence is the morphology - density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of galaxies with distinct morphological types ( essentially spirals , lenticulars and ellipticals ) correlates strongly with the local galaxy density , with high - density environments being populated preponderantly by early - type galaxies .",
    "this is related to the dependence of the fraction of star - forming galaxies with the environment , based in the presence or not of emission lines , such as h@xmath2  and , in galaxy spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such dependence is also intrinsically related to the reduced gaseous content of galaxies in denser regions @xcite .",
    "recent studies have found that the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies is the most sensitive parameter to galaxy environment , declining strongly in high - density regions of galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas structural parameters are less affected by environment @xcite .",
    "the relation environment - sfr has also an additional dependence on galaxy luminosity , being steeper for fainter galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , when one restricts the analysis to star - forming galaxies the median sfr of this class of objects seems to be unaffected by environment , although the fraction of such galaxies decreases with increasing local density @xcite .",
    "the most plausible way to account for these trends is to assume that galaxy properties ( mainly those related to star formation and gas properties ) are affected by environment through well known physical mechanisms acting on galaxies .",
    "this path , linked directly to the environment , gives origin to a _ nurture _ perspective for galaxy evolution .",
    "in fact , several physical mechanisms were already proposed and studied to account for the evolutionary trends discussed above .",
    "interactions between the intragalactic and intergalactic medium , including gas removal and evaporation ( _ ram pressure stripping _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the suppression of the accretion of gas - rich materials in the neighbourhood of the galaxy ( _ starvation _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are typical mechanisms claimed to affect star formation properties of galaxies infalling onto denser regions .    another path by which galaxy evolution proceeds is related to the initial conditions established during the formation epoch of galaxies , which could , in principle , account for the relations between galaxy properties and environment .",
    "this path gives origin to a _ nature _ perspective driving galaxy evolution .",
    "as expected from a biased galaxy formation scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , massive galaxies are formed earlier preferentially in high - density regions ; in opposition , low mass galaxies would be formed later with a smooth distribution in the density field .",
    "thus , in this scenario there is , naturally , an expected relation between age of formation ( or mass ) and environmental density .",
    "in fact , hierarchical galaxy formation models successfuly reproduce the morphology - density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , demonstrating that it is present even if the physical mechanisms mentioned above are not considered .",
    "additionally , studies based on high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) and also on local galaxies ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a ; heavens et al . 2004",
    "; mateus et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter seagal ii ) have revealed that the existence of a ` downsizing ' in galaxy formation is extremely important in analysis involving the star formation properties of galaxies .",
    "these results suggest that massive galaxies have stopped to form stars at earlier times , with low mass systems comprising a large fraction among galaxies with ongoing star formation .",
    "these trends are also recovered by recent high - resolution simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and semi - analytic models for galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the physical origin of the downsizing is still a subject of debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we will shed some light into the discussion concerning galaxy formation and evolution by investigating the role of environment on the stellar population properties of galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "other works have increased our understanding on this issue through distinct approaches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we will use the results of the application of a spectral synthesis method to a volume limited sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "this method is able to recover important physical properties of galaxies from their spectra , including mean stellar ages , mean stellar metallicities and stellar masses , among others .",
    "the details of such approach were discussed by cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ( hereafter seagal i ) and its results have been recently used in seagal ii , where we have studied the bimodality of the galaxy population .    in this work",
    "we show that the relations between galaxy properties and environment , well characterised by the age  density relation , are distinct when we divide galaxies according to luminosity or stellar mass .",
    "this is a result of the different mass - to - light ( @xmath3 ) ratios of galaxies in distinct environments . in dense regions galaxies of same luminosity tend to have higher @xmath3 ratios .",
    "we argue that a natural path emerges from these results but via a nurture way in the sense that massive galaxies are formed preferentially in high - density regions ( where the evolution was accelerated ) in the high-@xmath4 universe ( when the star formation rate was high ) , since their stellar populations also tend to be the oldest ones and they inhabit the densest regions we observe in the local universe .",

    "the result of the procedure is a list of parameters for each galaxy .",
    "the most important for the discussion in this paper are : a ) the dust - corrected stellar mass inside the fibre ; the total stellar mass ( @xmath30 ) is computed _ a posteriori _ after correcting for the fraction of luminosity outside the fibre assuming that the galaxy mass - to - light ratio does not depend of the radius ; b ) the mean stellar age , weighted either by light , @xmath31 , or by mass @xmath32 ; c ) the mean stellar metallicity , light and mass - weighted , @xmath33  and @xmath34 , respectively ; d ) the v - band stellar extinction @xmath35 ; and e ) the velocity dispersion , @xmath28 . besides , by subtracting the synthesised spectrum from the observed one , we get a `` pure - emission '' residual spectrum , which is useful for analysis of the galaxy emission lines .",
    "the volume - limited sample adopted in this work secures a high completeness for galaxies brighter than @xmath1 .",

    "in this section we describe some usual tracers of star formation activity in galaxies based on the h@xmath2  emission line , and how they are related to spectral synthesis products .",
    "our main intention here is to define these quantities and show that the light - weighted mean stellar age behaves as a good tracer of current star formation in galaxies .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath2  emission line is an useful parameter when studying the star formation properties of galaxies .",
    "this quantity is related to the ratio between the amount of star formation occurring in a galaxy in the last @xmath44 yr and its past integrated star formation history . since the measurement of ew(h@xmath2 )",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a more direct and useful tracer of star formation rate in galaxies is the h@xmath2luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when appropriately corrected for underlying absorption and dust extinction , and in the case of fibre - based spectra also for aperture effects , the h@xmath2sfr estimate is found to be consistent with radio , far - infrared , and @xmath5-band estimates @xcite . in our case",
    ", the underlying stellar absorption is automatically subtracted when computing the residual spectra ( as discussed in section  [ sec : synthesis ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath2sfr , corrected by aperture effects , is then simply derived by using the expression adapted from @xcite for a chabrier imf ( 0.1 - 100 m@xmath42 ) and with the prescriptions given by @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the observed luminosity of h@xmath2(in ergs s@xmath12 ) corrected by nebular extinction with the h@xmath2/h@xmath47intrinsic intensity ratio , @xmath7 is the @xmath7-band petrosian magnitude representing the total galaxy flux , and @xmath48 is the @xmath7-band fibre magnitude.luminosity inside the fibre is characteristic of the whole galaxy , and that the continuum flux at the h@xmath2wavelength is well represented by the flux at the effective wavelength of the @xmath7-band filter ( see details in * ? ? ?",

    "consequently , only galaxies with higher levels of star formation activity will have their star formation rates evaluated .",
    "another interesting quantity related to star formation in galaxies is the sfr per unit stellar mass , or specific star formation rate ( ssfr(h@xmath2 ) ) , which is associated to the strength of the current burst of star formation relative to the underlying stellar mass of a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case ,",
    "this parameter is easily obtained by dividing the sfr(h@xmath2 ) ( in m@xmath42 yr@xmath12 ) by the dust - corrected stellar mass , @xmath30 .    in order to illustrate the quantities described above , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewha_versus_sfr_ha ] we show the relation between the ew(h@xmath2 ) and the sfr(h@xmath2 ) , and that between the ew(h@xmath2 ) and the specific h@xmath2  sfr .",

    "it is important to stress here that we only consider galaxies with h@xmath2  measured in emission with a @xmath20 greater than 3 ( following @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we also restrict this analysis to galaxies with h@xmath2  emission coming from normal star - forming regions by excluding hosts of active galactic nuclei in the same way as done by @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewha_versus_sfr_ha ] we note a clear dependence on galaxy luminosity for the relation between ew(h@xmath2 ) and sfr(h@xmath2 ) , in the sense that for a given value of ew(h@xmath2 ) , brighter galaxies have higher sfrs .",
    "this luminosity dependence disappears when dealing with the specific sfr .",
    "the mean light - weighted stellar age of a galaxy is related to the formation epoch of massive and bright stars , frequently associated to starbursts .",
    "hence , low values of @xmath31  reflect the recent activity of intense star formation operating in a given galaxy , whereas high values of it indicate that most of the galaxy light comes from older stellar populations , with less significant , or even none , recent star formation episodes . as this quantity",
    "is obtained by our spectral synthesis approach in a robust way we will inspect its ability in tracing star formation activity of galaxies .    in fig .",

    "we do not show the relation between @xmath31  and sfr(h@xmath2 ) since this latter parameter has a dependence on galaxy luminosity , related to the amount of stellar mass recently formed in a galaxy . as in fig .",

    "this method fixes a value for @xmath19 and lets the volume @xmath51 , centred on a given object and extending to its @xmath19th nearest neighbour , be a random variable .",
    "this volume is large in low density regions and small in high density regions . in this way",
    ", this method provides a spatial description of the density field , which has been recently explored by @xcite in a study of field galaxies .",
    "when one goes to denser environments , velocity dispersion is high and neglecting peculiar velocities in distance estimates could underrate local densities determined with the @xmath19nn method . in order to avoid this effect , a better way to derive local galaxy density via nearest neighbours",
    "is by considering a projected distribution of galaxies , instead of a spatial one .",
    "this procedure has been intensively used in studies devoted to galaxy environments , since the classical work by @xcite to more recent works based on 2dfgrs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and sdss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data .",
    "a more common approach when dealing with large redshift survey data is to define a limit in redshift space around a given galaxy , for instance in the range @xmath52",
    "km s@xmath12 , to find its @xmath19th nearest neighbour ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this limit emulates a three - dimensional description of the density field by excluding galaxies in the foreground / background with an objective criterion .",
    "as noted by @xcite , projected density estimates with limits in the line - of - sight velocities between @xmath52 and @xmath53 km s@xmath12 are best suited for the description of a broad range of environments .",
    "here we use the expression @xmath54 to estimate the local galaxy density should replace @xmath19 in the numerator of the expression for @xmath55 in order to achieve an unbiased estimate of local density @xcite . ] , where @xmath56 is the projected distance to the @xmath19th nearest neighbour of a given galaxy .",
    "we adopt the usual limit in redshift space of @xmath52  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "additionally , in our density estimates , we have prevented an incorrect determination of @xmath55 due to border effects by excluding galaxies whose @xmath19th neighbours have projected distances greater than the distance of the galaxy to the closest border of the survey region or of the sample volume . note that in the search of neighbours and in the density estimates we have used all galaxies in the volume limited sample independently of the quality of their spectroscopic data .",
    "we have computed our local galaxy density estimates with the values @xmath57 and @xmath58 in order to assess the influence of the choice of this parameter in the results presented in this work .",
    "however , we have found that none of the results discussed in the next sections depend on the values of the @xmath19 tested here . in the rest of this paper we will adopt the local galaxy density as evaluated from the distance to the tenth neighbour , @xmath59 .",
    "we have compared our local density estimates defined by @xmath59 to a global parameter : the distance to the nearest cluster centre from each galaxy in our sample .",
    "we searched for galaxy clusters present in our sample with the help of the c4 cluster catalogue @xcite , which contains 748 clusters identified in the spectroscopic sample of the sdss data release 2 ( dr2 ) .",
    "this catalogue is about 90 per cent complete and 95 per cent pure above @xmath60 h@xmath12 m@xmath42 and within @xmath61 , thus covering the redshift range of our sample .",
    "therefore , for each galaxy in our sample we can compute its distance to the nearest cluster centre , defining in this way a cluster - centric radius normalised by the cluster virial radius . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_versus_rvirial ] , we show the relation between our density parameter ( @xmath59 ) and the cluster - centric radius ( @xmath50 ) only for galaxies located in the regions covered by the dr2 data .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the two quantities , mainly for @xmath62 , above which we note that the median values of local galaxy density are almost constant .",
    "a possible source of bias in the estimation of local galaxy density in the sdss data is due to a technical limitation in the procedure of assignment of fibres to spectroscopic targets closer than 55@xmath63 in the sky .",
    "this problem , referred as ` fibre collision ' , becomes very important in denser environments and about 89 per cent of selected objects are unobserved for this reason @xcite .    in order to assess the significance of this bias in our results we have searched in the dr4 photometric catalogue for galaxies closer than 55@xmath63 of each galaxy in our spectroscopic selected sample , which actually have been rejected in the fibre assignment procedure .",
    "note that these missing galaxies only affect our local galaxy density estimate if they have radial velocities close to those of the selected galaxies .",
    "however , as they do not have any redshift information we have overestimated the effects of the fibre collision bias by supposing that all such missing ` neighbours ' are at the same redshift as the selected galaxies . from the total of 63659 selected galaxies in our volume limited sample , we have found about 12 per cent of galaxies with missing ` neighbours ' closer than 55@xmath63 . we have then evaluated our density estimates by considering that these missing objects were in fact close neighbours .",
    "after redoing our analysis with these new densities we concluded that none of the results shown in this work is affected by the bias due to fibre collision .",
    "in this section we investigate how some physical properties related to the stellar populations of nearby galaxies behave as a function of the local galaxy density .",
    "we begin by investigating the dependence of the fraction of galaxies of distinct mean stellar ages and masses with the environment , which can be linked to the classical morphology  density relation .",
    "the environmental dependence of star - formation activity in galaxies , specially if estimated through the light - weighted mean stellar age parameter , is further investigated .",
    "we also analyse how the metallicities of galaxies vary along the density range studied in this work . finally , the role of stellar mass and luminosity in driving the star - formation  density relation is investigated here , mainly through a principal component analysis applied to our parameter set .",
    "it is well established that the fraction of galaxies classified according to distinct morphological types is strongly related with the environment , with high - density regions typical of galaxy clusters being populated essentially by elliptical galaxies , in contrast to the high fraction of spirals found in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this galaxy type segregation is investigated here in terms of two physical galaxy properties : the mean light - weighted stellar age and the stellar mass .",
    "seagal ii studied these parameters in light of the bimodality observed in galaxy populations and found that the mean stellar age of galaxies is the primary responsible for the dichotomy between blue and red galaxies seen in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .they also found that the stellar mass has an additional role in the sense that , blue , star forming galaxies are preferentially of low mass .    in fig .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction ] that high - density environments are populated by galaxies with older stellar populations and larger stellar masses , with the fraction of these objects increasing as the environment becomes denser .",

    "[ fig : rho_versus_rvirial ] .",
    "additionally , we note that in the case of @xmath30 , the fractions only change for the two extreme bins , whereas intermediate ones possess constant fractions along @xmath59 .",

    "[ fig : fraction ] is not the same as the `` break '' at a characteristic galaxy density reported by @xcite and @xcite that we discuss below , since here we are investigating only galaxy fractions as a function of the local galaxy density , instead of the sfr  density relation itself .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "an important issue concerning to the use of star formation tracers based on emission line measurements  like those related to the h@xmath2emission line  is the absence of data for galaxies with little ( or even none ) recent star formation activity , since the emission lines ( if they exist ) in the spectra of these systems are too weak to be measured with appreciable signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "additionally , in galaxies where a starburst is obscured by the presence of huge amounts of dust , the emission lines will also become very weak to be detected .",
    "thus , results from environmental studies based solely on the ew(h@xmath2 ) or sfr(h@xmath2 ) parameters could suffer from this kind of bias . in section  [ sec : star_formation ]",

    "we note in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : age_rho ] , that the median values of @xmath31increase significantly as the environment becomes denser , independently of the galaxy luminosity , with the relation for fainter galaxies being steeper than that of brighter ones .",

    "[ fig : age_rho ] ) behave in a distinct way with respect to the local galaxy density .",
    "low - mass galaxies have median values of mean stellar ages slightly varying along the bins of density , showing low values of @xmath31   characteristic of late - type galaxies  in all environments .",

    "the stellar metallicity of low mass galaxies increases as the environment becomes denser , while massive galaxies have almost constant values of @xmath33along density bins . in the case of the mass weighted mean stellar metallicity ( @xmath34 ) versus local galaxy density , the trends are similar , although less steep than those for @xmath33 .",

    "thus , one could expect that they are directly associated to recent episodes of star formation in galaxies . in this way , low - mass ( or fainter ) galaxies in denser environments , which are currently forming stars ( following the results from fig .",
    "[ fig : age_rho ] ) , tend to have more metal - rich stellar populations than their counterparts in regions of lower densities .",
    "low mass galaxies have substantial amounts of gas to keep their high star formation rates .",
    "this gas could have been pre - enriched earlier preferentially in high - density environments , where the star formation activity was higher in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , one explanation is that these galaxies have already been formed in that denser environments , but have not stopped to form stars until the present epoch .",
    "thus , this result is additionally supported by the observed ` downsizing ' in galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", less luminous galaxies have a @xmath31  distribution peaked at older ages , whereas in low - density regions the distribution is double - peaked , unveiling the bimodal character of the galaxy population . on the other hand , in the case of galaxies",

    "the distributions are peaked at younger ages , indicative of the dominance of low - mass star - forming galaxies in low - density environments . at the other extreme ,",
    "represented by very luminous and massive galaxies , the distributions are similar , with the only difference being due to a larger fraction of galaxies with low values of @xmath31  in the distributions for luminous galaxies .",

    "we will investigate this issue through a different approach , based on an useful statistical technique frequently adopted to finding patterns in high - dimensional data .",
    "the parameter set discussed in this section was examined in more detail by means of a principal component analysis ( pca ) in order to determine the combinations of parameters which summarise the distribution of the whole set .",

    "we have followed the same procedure as used in the previous sections by dividing the galaxy sample in bins of luminosity and stellar mass containing the same number of objects .",
    "a pca was then executed for each bin separately .",
    "we found that the principal component of highest variance ( pc1 ) accounts for more than 90 per cent of the total variance for all bins considered .",
    "the remaining variance is mainly accounted for the second principal component ( pc2 ) .",
    "although each principal component is a linear combination of all the input variables , it is interesting to verify whether some variables in the parameter set are well correlated with the main components because , in this case , they are responsible for a significant fraction of the sample variance . in table  [ table_pca1 ] we show the spearman rank correlation coefficients between the two principal components and the five parameters in our input set , for each bin divided by luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "we found that the local galaxy density ( @xmath80 ) shows the strongest relation with pc1 ; the spearman rank correlation coefficient between this parameter and pc1 is almost unity .",
    "moreover , the pc2 shows a significant correlation with the @xmath31 , with correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 .",
    "thus , the plane pc1 @xmath88 pc2 is well represented by the age ",

    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite in a study on the environmental dependence of the fraction of star - forming and passive galaxies in a sample of field galaxies drawn from the 2dfgrs data .",
    "even in rarefied environments the fraction of star - forming galaxies decreases significantly with increasing local galaxy density .",
    "thus , there is a general consensus that physical mechanisms suppressing star formation in galaxies are not inherent only to the densest environments related to galaxy clusters .",
    "it is also interesting to note that faint and bright galaxies seem to have evolved through distinct evolutionary paths , and different physical mechanisms could be at work .",
    "however , the relevance of such mechanisms acting on galaxies today may be important only in some particular cases . @xcite",
    "have confirmed this trend by combining samples from the 2dfgrs and sdss , with emphasis on environments related to galaxy groups .",
    "these authors argue that galaxies in dense regions have had typically more interactions than those in low - density regions over a longer period of time .",
    "thus , it seems that galaxy transformations induced by environment have taken place more effectively at higher redshifts .",

    ", we have shown that the nurture hypothesis which is invoked to explain galaxy evolution in distinct environments also explains the observed star formation - density relation in the local universe .",
    "indeed , in the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation , as galaxy clustering evolves the density around a galaxy tends to increase in all environments .",
    "higher density probably means more interactions which could , in principle , play a significant role in originating the relation between star formation activity in galaxies and local galaxy density .    the first numerical simulations with cdm initial conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the high - redshift progenitors of today cluster galaxies were formed in high - density regions , which tend to collapse earlier than low - density environments @xcite .",
    "galaxies formed in high - density regions tend to be ellipticals , because disks are destroyed by frequent interactions and the hot gas does not cool enough to form new stars .",
    "thus , it is expected that the oldest galaxies were formed earlier and preferentially in high - density regions ; galaxies in low - density environments are able to keep their cold gas and form stars .",
    "consequently , a natural path for galaxy evolution emerges , with galaxies in denser environments being more evolved than those in low - density regions @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite , using a sample of high - redshift galaxies from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) , investigated the star formation history of galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass .",
    "they showed that the most massive galaxies formed most of their stars earlier than intermediate and low - mass galaxies .",
    "this trend gives support to an apparent anti - hierarchical behaviour , commonly referred as ` downsizing ' in galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the discovery of an overdensity of galaxies ( or proto - cluster ) at @xmath98 by @xcite , with a significant fraction of old galaxies , is consistent with the theoretical expectation for the acceleration of structure formation in denser regions .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions drawn by @xcite , that clusters in high - density environments evolve more rapidly than those in low - density regions .      in this work",
    ", we have confirmed that high - density environments are dominated by massive galaxies with the oldest stellar populations in the local universe , which can be associated to the early - type galaxies of the morphology - density relation .",
    "we have also found that the recent star formation activity of less massive galaxies , as inferred by the mean light - weighted age of their stellar populations , does not change significantly along the density range presented in this work .",
    "this result suggests that these low - mass galaxies have large amounts of star formation in low as well as in high - density regions of the local universe .",
    "however , as the lowest stellar mass bin considered in this work is dominated by late - type galaxies , with the fraction of low - mass early - type galaxies being affected by the selection criteria adopted here , this result should be confirmed by other observations . at the other extreme ,",

    "massive galaxies have older stellar populations everywhere . only for an intermediate mass range ( @xmath99 m@xmath42 ) , associated to the transition in galaxy properties ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the recent star formation activity of galaxies appears to decrease with increasing galaxy density . on the other hand , when we take galaxies divided according to their luminosities , instead of stellar masses , the star formation activity of brighter galaxies and of fainter ones decreases significantly when one goes from low to high - density environments , resulting in the well know star formation ",

    "thus , the fact that galaxies of all luminosities present star formation activity decreasing with increasing density is related to the higher stellar masses of galaxies in denser environments , independently of their luminosities . additionally , from recent results concerning the existence of a downsizing in the processes regulating star formation in galaxies , we expect that most massive galaxies have stopped to form stars at early times , perhaps thanks to internally driven mechanisms such as a mass threshold below which star formation was not successful @xcite .",
    "thus , the star formation ",
    "density relation found for galaxies divided according to their luminosities , being steeper for fainter galaxies @xcite , should be a `` natural '' consequence of galaxy evolution .",
    "these results are also supported by the recent findings obtained by @xcite in a study on the build up of the colour - magnitude relation of galaxies as a function of the environment .",
    "they also confirm the downsizing way for the evolution of galaxy properties , with the star formation processes being displaced from massive to low - mass galaxies , and from galaxies in denser to low - density environments , as the evolution proceeds . in addition , our work can also be related to the recent study carried out by @xcite , who have investigated the evolution of the proportion of star - forming galaxies ( defined with the ew ) in clusters since @xmath100 ( from a sample obtained with the eso distant cluster survey ) to @xmath101 ( from a sdss cluster sample ) .",
    "poggianti et al . argue that the star formation - density relation should have a ` primordial ' component and an ` evolved ' one , each of them showing distinct environmental dependences , and that the relation is established at very high redshift at the moment of formation of the first stars in galaxies .",
    "this scenario is particularly linked to the trends shown by our own results .",
    "the trend related to stellar metallicity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : metallicity ] reinforces these ideas : low - mass galaxies in denser environments are metal - rich compared with those in low - density regions .",
    "this arises from the fact that denser regions tend to be more evolved than rarefied environments .",
    "thus , low - mass galaxies in dense regions have already been established in such environments , but have not stopped to form stars until the present epoch , contrarily to the evolution of massive systems . in this sense , a natural path for galaxy evolution proceeds via a nurture way mainly at high - redshifts : massive galaxies have been formed in denser regions and evolved in an accelerated way , contrasting with a more _ unsocial _ life of low - mass galaxies preferentially inhabiting low density regions of the universe .",
    "this is also related to the timing of the process of formation of early - type galaxies that occurred about 12 gyr earlier in cluster environments compared to the field @xcite . in this view",
    ", denser environments behave as an accelerator of the galaxy formation process , amplifying small natural differences imprinted on galaxies in their formation epoch .",
    "this results that `` nature '' necessarily acts _ via _ `` nurture '' effects .    in this _ nature via nurture _ scenario for galaxy evolution , the environmental dependence of star formation properties of galaxies , commonly related to some ( or various ) physical mechanisms acting on late - type galaxies infalling onto galaxy clusters , is determined by the higher @xmath3 ratio of galaxies in denser environments , in addition to the observed downsizing in galaxy formation .",
    "these two ingredients play a crucial role in defining the star formation - density relation observed in luminosity divided samples .",
    "nevertheless , we note that environmental effects on galaxy properties really take place in some cases , such as the existence of post - starburst galaxies in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , passive spirals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and short starburst galaxies @xcite",
    ". however , the fraction of such ` environment - product ' objects is very reduced , indicative of a very rapid and efficient mechanism acting on these galaxies or actually due to the rarity of such transformations in the nearby universe .",
    "in this fourth paper of the seagal collaboration , we have shed some light on the discussion about the environmental dependence of galaxy properties in the local universe .",
    "we based our analysis on the stellar population properties of galaxies in a volume - limited sample drawn from the sdss data release 4 .",
    "the application of a spectral synthesis method to the data produces robust estimators for mean stellar ages , mean stellar metallicities and stellar mass , which have been used in this work to characterise the stellar populations of galaxies .",
    "the environment is defined by the local galaxy density estimated from a nearest neighbour approach , and by the distance to cluster centres obtained from a public catalogue of sdss clusters .",
    "the main approach used in this study is the comparison of the relations between galaxy properties and environment for galaxies divided in intervals of luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "we summarise our main findings below :    1 .",
    "we recover the star formation ",
    "density relation in terms of the mean light - weighted stellar age , @xmath31 , which is strongly correlated with star formation parameters derived from h@xmath2emission line . 2 .",
    "we confirm that high - density environments are populated by a large fraction of massive galaxies with old stellar populations , in opposition to low - density regions , dominated by low - mass galaxies actively forming stars .",
    "we also note that galaxies with intermediate stellar masses have constant fractions along the range of densities covered by our sample .",
    "the transition in galaxy fraction occurs at @xmath65  @xmath66  mpc@xmath67 , corresponding to 23 virial radii from cluster centres .",
    "the environmental dependence of @xmath31  is distinct when we divide galaxies according to luminosity or stellar mass .",
    "the relation between mean age and local density is remarkable for galaxies in all bins of luminosity . on the other hand , only for a intermediate stellar mass interval ( associated to a transition in galaxy properties ) the relation shows a change in galaxy properties . for low - mass galaxies , the relation slightly increases along the density range , but showing low values of @xmath31   characteristic of late - type galaxies  in all environments .",
    "the most massive galaxies also show a slight change in the median values of @xmath31  as galaxy density increases , but their values are higher everywhere .",
    "we find that the distinct behaviours of the _ age  density relation _ for galaxies divided by luminosity or stellar mass are associated to the large stellar mass of galaxies with the same luminosity in dense environments .",
    "in other words , the well known star formation ",
    "density relation results from the prevalence of massive systems in high - density environments , independently of galaxy luminosity , in addition to the observed downsizing in galaxy formation , where the star formation is shifted from massive galaxies at early times to low - mass ones as the universe evolves .",
    "a principal component analysis of our parameter set reveals that the local galaxy density is the primary responsible for the total variance present in our data , whereas the mean light - weighted stellar age of galaxies is the second one .",
    "this result reflects that the age ",
    "density relation is the main driver of the environmental dependence observed in some galaxy properties .",
    "the mean stellar metallicity of less massive / luminous galaxies increases in high - density regions , indicating that even low - mass galaxies in dense environments tend to be more evolved than their counterparts in low - density regions .",
    "our results support that a natural path for galaxy evolution proceeds _ via _ a nurture way mainly at high - redshifts : massive galaxies have been formed in denser regions and evolved in an accelerated way , contrasting with a more _ unsocial _ life of low - mass galaxies preferentially inhabiting low density regions of the universe .    in this work , the concept of ` nature via nurture '",

    "* for a genetic view of this expression ) in the scenario of galaxy evolution was advocated in order to summarise the results obtained here related to the environmental dependence of galaxy properties in the local universe .",
    "many steps are needed towards a comprehensive view of the processes which have guided galaxy formation and evolution , mainly those related to the properties of the stellar content of galaxies in high redshifts .",
