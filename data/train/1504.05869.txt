    "the diffusion equation is widely used to describe transport phenomena in which heat , mass , and other physical quantities are transferred in space and time due to underlying molecular collision processes @xcite . at steady - state and when the source term does not depend explicitly on the concentration of the associated field , such diffusion processes settle down in the form of a non - local relation between the spatial distribution of the source and the resulting concentration of the associated field , a relation which is governed by the poisson equation @xcite .",
    "the notion of the poisson equation as the steady - state solution of the diffusion equation extends to many other phenomena , e.g. electrostatics systems @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , chemistry and biology @xcite , molecular biophysics @xcite , density functional theory and solid - state physics @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "in fact , solving the poisson equation accurately and efficiently continues to be a subject of intense research to this day .    from a microscopic point of view",
    ", the diffusion equation emerges from the underlying boltzmann kinetic equation in the limit of very small knudsen numbers , i.e. molecular mean free path much shorter than the typical macroscopic scale .",
    "solving the boltzmann kinetic equation to study diffusion processes makes apparently little sense , since the boltzmann distribution function lives in a double - dimensional phase - space , i.e. position and velocity .",
    "however , in the last two decades , minimal ( lattice ) versions of the boltzmann equation have been developed , in which velocity space is reduced to a small set of discrete velocities , so that the computational cost is cut down dramatically , making the solution of the lattice kinetic equation often competitive towards standard grid - discretisation of the corresponding partial differential equation .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) has attracted much interest for solving the navier - stokes equations @xcite , and has been extended to solve other type of phenomena , e.g. diffusion equation @xcite , maxwell equations@xcite , quantum systems @xcite , relativistic fluid dynamics @xcite , and the poisson equation @xcite , to name but a few . to the best of our knowledge , to date , the solution of the poisson equation based on kinetic theory has been confined to smooth ( non - stiff ) source terms and small knudsen numbers @xcite .",
    "if the target is the steady - state solution of the diffusion equation , as it is the case for the poisson equation , the kinetic approach looses much of its appeal , since its inherently real - time dynamics must proceed through smaller time - steps than those affordable by fictitious - time iteration techniques . in this paper",
    "we shall show that such gap can be closed by resorting to higher - order kinetic formulations , at least for the cases where the source term does not depend on the concentration field avoiding artificial solutions as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "higher - order formulations of the lb equation have been developed before , mostly in the context of thermal @xcite and relativistic fluid dynamics @xcite , and recently , density functional theory @xcite .",
    "there , the main idea is to design the equilibrium distribution in such a way to include not only the conserved moments , such as density and current , but also the non - conserved ones , namely the momentum flux tensor and the heat flux , and eventually higher order kinetic moments with no direct hydrodynamic significance ( sometimes called `` ghosts '' ) .",
    "clearly , in order to match this longer ladder of kinetic moments , a correspondingly larger set of discrete velocities is required .",
    "it should be emphasized that the discrete kinetic equation is a superset of the diffusion equation , and consequently , to the purpose of solving the diffusion equation alone , higher - order contributions must be regarded as discretisation artefacts which need to be minimised , and possibly canceled altogether .",
    "this is precisely the target of this paper . here",
    ", we will use higher - order lattices and associated equilibria , to remove higher - order contributions to the macroscopic equations reproduced by the boltzmann equation . for this purpose",
    ", we develop the respective lbm and show that , by expanding the equilibrium distribution up to seventh order in hermite polynomials , one can solve the poisson equation _ six orders _ of magnitude faster than with standard lb models , at a given level accuracy .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , we introduce the diffusion equation with stiff source term and the associated boltzmann kinetic equation . in sec",
    ".  [ sec2 ] , we describe the influence of higher order moments on the steady - state solution of the diffusion equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we develop a lbm for the poisson equation , validate and compare the model with standard cases . finally , we discuss the results and outlook of our work .",
    "let us begin by writing the diffusion equation for a scalar @xmath0 in the standard form : @xmath1 where @xmath0 is the concentration of particles ( temperature in the case of the heat transfer equation ) , @xmath2 is the diffusivity , and @xmath3 is the source term , which , in our case , depending neither on @xmath0 nor on time .",
    "the steady - state version of eq",
    ".   delivers the poisson equation with source @xmath4 .",
    "it is well - known that this equation can be obtained from an underlying boltzmann kinetic equation , via a chapman - enskog expansion , in the limit of small knudsen numbers , @xmath5 , being @xmath6 the mean - free path and @xmath7 the characteristic size of the system @xcite .    the boltzmann equation in the single relaxation time approximation ( bgk )",
    "@xcite reads as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the probability distribution function , @xmath10 are the microscopic velocity vectors , @xmath11 is the relaxation time , and @xmath12 is the equilibrium distribution .    in the non - relativistic context",
    ", the local equilibrium is given by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the local flow speed .",
    "such local equilibrium encodes the basic symmetries of newtonian mechanics , particularly galilean invariance , which is built - in via the dependence on the molecular speed relative to the fluid @xmath15 , rather than the absolute one , @xmath16 . in order to secure galilean invariance for _ any _ fluid speed , kinetic moments at _ all orders",
    "_ should be matched on the lattice .",
    "this would require an infinite connectivity , which is clearly unviable on any realistic lattice . as a result , lb local equilibria",
    "are typically based on finite - order hermite expansions , of the form @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the tensorial hermite polynomials of order @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the weight function defined as , @xmath21 @xmath22 being the sound speed .",
    "note that @xmath20 is the uniform _",
    "equilibrium , corresponding the no - flow limit of the local equilibrium @xmath12 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 ( kinetic moments ) are calculated by projecting the equilibrium distribution onto the respective hermite polynomial , @xmath24 the lowest - order kinetic moments have a direct macroscopic interpretation .",
    "for instance , by integrating on the velocity space ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 where the last equality comes from the requirement of mass conservation on the collsion operator , namely : @xmath27 the diffusivity of the system is dictated by the relaxation time as @xmath28    it can be shown that the boltzmann equation recovers the diffusion equation in the limit of small knudsen numbers , which is related with the mean - free path and therefore with the relaxation time .",
    "this is the strongly - interacting fluid regime , whereby the particle dynamics is collision - dominated , so that collective behaviour sets in on a short timescale @xmath11 .",
    "the opposite limit of large knudsen numbers , hence large values of @xmath11 , corresponds to the free - particle motion ( ballistic regime ) , whereby memory of the initial conditions is kept for a very long time .",
    "it is therefore clear that in the ballistic regime higher order moments of the equilibrium distribution do not relax and consequently the boltzmann equation does not converge to any standard diffusion equation . on the other hand , by increasing the relaxation time , hence the effective diffusivity , one would intuitively expect a quickest path to steady - state . in this respect",
    ", it would be highly desirable to derive a diffusion equation in kinetic form , which can attain steady - state solution at relatively large knudsen numbers by exactly cancelling as many high - order terms as possible .",
    "as discussed above , this can be achieved by zeroing as many higher order contributions as possible , while retaining the largest possible diffusion coefficient .",
    "let us consider the case when all time derivatives are zero , @xmath29 . the boltzmann equation , eq .",
    ", can be written as , @xmath30 by integrating this equation in velocity space , we obtain a steady - state continuity equation for the current density : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "multiplying eq .   by @xmath10 and integrating again , we obtain @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the momentum - flux tensor and @xmath36 the source current .",
    "the first term at the right - hand - side takes the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the flow speed in the local equilibrium . for the case of a purely diffusive dynamics",
    "this term is zero .",
    "the second term contributes a shift @xmath39 to the flow speed , and it must also be set to zero for the case of pure diffusion .",
    "finally , the pressure tensor shoud reduce to @xmath40 , so that inserting ( [ second ] ) into ( [ first ] ) , the diffusion equation is obtained .",
    "the first two conditions are automatically ensured by setting @xmath41 in the local equilibrium .",
    "the third one , however , can not be enforced exactly because of higher order contributions to the momemtum flux tensors .",
    "indeed , by iterating the procedure , one obtains the general expression : @xmath42 = s \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are both tensors of order @xmath19 .",
    "note that for small knudsen numbers ( @xmath45 ) higher - order terms become negligible and the series is convergent .",
    "we also observe that the solution is dictated by the equilibrium distribution and the source term , so that , by properly choosing both expressions , higher order terms can be canceled thus opening the way to high - accuracy solutions of the poisson equation .    in numerical practice , accuracy is typically improved by increasing the resolution of the grid .",
    "this imposes correspondingly smaller time steps , which is clearly expensive , especially in three dimensions .",
    "high - order methods are meant to mitigate the problem by achieving the same level of accuracy with many less grid points .",
    "they are typically based on higher - order stencils for the discretisation of the corresponding differential operators .    in this work",
    ", we present a procedure whereby the same goal is achieved by drawing directly from an underlying lattice kinetic theory , i.e. by a suitable ( non - gaussian ) extension of the local kinetic equilibria as combined with the use of larger sets of discrete speeds than those typically employed in standard lattice boltzmann theory .",
    "in order for the boltzmann kinetics to converge to the poisson equation , the following conditions need to be met : @xmath46 the equilibrium distribution can be expressed as a separable product of a function of the microscopic velocity ( global uniform equilibrium ) and a function of the time - spatial coordinates , namely : @xmath47 and similarly for the source term : @xmath48 in the above , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are velocity dependent functions that need to be determined based on the conditions above . to this purpose ,",
    "we write : @xmath51 and , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constant coefficients and @xmath55 is a cut - off truncating the hermite expansion . with reference to the one - dimensional case and an expansion up to seventh order ( @xmath56 )",
    ", we obtain : @xmath57 and @xmath58 + \\frac{3c_s^2 - 6 c_s^2 v^2",
    "+ v^4}{8 c_s^4 } + \\frac{15 c_s^6 - 45 c_s^4 v^2 + 15 c_s^2 v^4 - v^6}{48 c_s^6}\\right ) , \\ ] ] where the weight @xmath20 for the one - dimensional case is defined as @xmath59 with eqs .   and",
    ", one can prove that the the following expressions for the moments are fulfilled : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "these expressions hold only up to @xmath66 .",
    "to develop a lattice boltzmann model and solve the poisson equation numerically , we need to impose a quadrature and find a corresponding set of finite velocity vectors , @xmath67 , such that the orthogonality conditions are fulfilled to the desired order @xcite , namely : @xmath68 here @xmath69 are discrete weights and @xmath70 are the one - dimensional hermite polynomials .",
    "the number of velocity vectors @xmath71 depends on the order of the expansion that we intend to reproduce with the quadrature . for expansions up to seventh order , we need at least @xmath72 velocity vectors and weights .",
    "each set of numbers also provides its own lattice sound speed @xmath22 , which goes from about @xmath73 with @xmath74 to nearly @xmath75 with @xmath56 .",
    "the details of these values are given in [ app ] .",
    "higher - order schemes are usually exposed to numerical instabilities , due to the appearance of additional modes in the dispersion relation . however , since our procedure is designed to annihilate precisely these modes , we expect our approach to be stable . furthermore , the method proposed here can also be used as a systematic technique of calculating weights and velocity vectors , such that one can achieve the desired level of accuracy for the computation of laplacian operators , similar to the work proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have performed the theoretical analysis in one - dimension , however , extensions to two- and three - dimensions are straightforward , by using the tensorial form of the hermite polynomials and by finding the discrete velocity vectors with the respective orthogonality conditions .",
    "for instance , in order to fulfill the conditions , up to fifth order , the following expansions apply : @xmath76 and @xmath77   + \\frac{15 c_s^4 - 10 c_s^2 \\vec{v}^2 + \\vec{v}^4}{8 c_s^4 } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where the weight @xmath78 is defined as @xmath79 for the three - dimensional case , we should calculate the corresponding set of discrete velocity vectors , @xmath80 , such that the orthogonality condition is fulfilled up to fifth order , namely : @xmath81 which is the three - dimensional version of eq .  .",
    "by solving these algebraic equations , we find that we need at least @xmath82 velocity vectors and @xmath83 weights .",
    "details are given in [ app ] .",
    "as an application , we solve the poisson equation @xcite , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the charge density and @xmath86 is the electric permittivity .    replacing the equilibrium distribution @xmath12 from eq .   into eq .",
    ", we obtain : @xmath87 implying that @xmath88 . in the lattice boltzmann model",
    ", one must take into account second order corrections to the relaxation time , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 the lattice boltzmann relaxation time .    from eq .",
    ", it is appreciated that the spatial derivatives of the source also introduce errors in the solution .",
    "thus , by annihilating higher order contributions , we are also eliminating spurious effects due to the derivatives of the source term .",
    "if the source term is smooth , this derivatives are negligible , however , for stiffer source terms , one can use the present approach to add accuracy to the solution . in order to investigate this issue , we solve the potential for the following charge density : @xmath91 where the integer @xmath92 controls the smoothness of the derivatives of the charge density , and @xmath7 is the simulated length , with @xmath93 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we see that for a relatively large system size , @xmath105 , the first order expansion is sufficient to produce satisfactory results , with errors around @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath74 , and below @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we see that by increasing the derivatives of the charge density ( increasing @xmath92 ) , the error increases for all values of the cut - off @xmath55 .",
    "however , as we have mentioned before , the effect of removing higher - order errors becomes crucial for the case of small system sizes . by decreasing the number of lattice cells ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the discrepancies become visual and the errors are around @xmath110 for @xmath111 , @xmath112 for @xmath113 , and less than @xmath114 for @xmath66 .     and @xmath95 .",

    "the fact that one can obtain very small errors by increasing the order of the expansion in the velocity space of the equilibrium distribution and source term , opens up the possibility of highly accurate solutions on very small grids .    increasing the order of the expansion inevitably implies an overhead of numerical operations per time step , thereby slowing down the simulations . on the other hand , higher order lattices also bring aditional side - benefits such as a higher sound speed @xmath22 , leading to a larger diffusion coefficient and , consequently , to a faster path to the steady - state solution . in order to highlight the concrete advantages of our approach",
    ", we next implement the same simulations for different orders @xmath55 and inspect the cpu time , number of iterations , and system size , required to achieve a specific level of accuracy .",

    "[ fig5 ] ( left ) , we see that , according to our expectations , by increasing the order of the expansion , the order of convergence , measured by the exponent @xmath104 , also increases and in a very substantial way . from the same figure ( right )",
    ", we can also observe that for all values of @xmath55 , the number of time - steps @xmath120 scales quadratically with the lattice size , and decreases with the order of the expansion @xmath55 .",
    "the former feature is the typical signature of diffusion process , while the second reflects the fact that higher order lattice deliver a larger sound speed , hence they take less time - steps to achieve a given level of accuracy .",
    "the computational time required to achieve a given accuracy clearly depends on the computational speed of the model on each given machine .",
    "this is conveniently expressed in terms of the number of lattice sites updates per cpu second , @xmath121 .",
    "this quantity is expected to be a decreasing function of @xmath55 , since higher - order quadratures require more operations per lattice site .",
    "actual measurements give the values reported in table [ table1 ] .",
    "although no clear trend can be extracted from these measurements , it is observed that the cases @xmath109 and @xmath56 are about five times more expensive than the cases @xmath107 and @xmath74 . also to be noted that @xmath122 , which is counter - intuitive .",
    "however , upon inspecting the velocity vectors ( see appendix [ app ] ) , one can appreciate that for @xmath56 the velocities are consecutive ( no velocity gap ) , while for @xmath109 they are not .",
    "since , memory access is faster for consecutive elements , we expect the case @xmath56 to perform better than @xmath113 .",
    "more generally , the dependence on @xmath55 appears to be highly dependent on memory access patterns , which are not easily quantified through simple scaling relations .",
    "the total cpu time , @xmath123 , it takes to attain steady - state for a given system size @xmath7 can be written as follows : @xmath124 in the above , the cubic dependence derives from the @xmath125 diffusive scaling , as combined with the number of sites @xmath7 ( the space - time computational volume of a diffusive process scales like @xmath126 in @xmath2 spatial dimensions ) .",
    "finally , @xmath127 is a relative scale for the number of time - steps , which is expected to decrease at increasing @xmath55 because of the increasing sound speed .",
    "the actual values of obtained in the simulations are reported in table [ table1 ] .    as an example , for the case @xmath128 , we find that the simulations take @xmath129 ( 65629 time steps ) , @xmath130 ( 65629 time steps ) , @xmath131 ( 33769 time steps ) , and @xmath132 ( 20079 time steps ) seconds , for @xmath133 respectively .",
    "this shows that the total computational time remains within a factor two across all values of @xmath55 , while the error with respect to the analytical solution decreases dramatically at increasing @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "hence , we can conclude that increasing @xmath55 leads to a dramatic boost of accuracy at a very moderate extra computational cost .",
    "finally , we have inspected the computational time to steady - state for a given accuracy , at changing the size of the problem and the order of the quadrature . by combining the previous relations , ( [ accur ] ) and ( [ tl3 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath134 the plot reports the computational time and system size needed to achieve a prescribed relative error , for the case in point @xmath135 .",
    "and system size @xmath7 needed to recover the solution of the poisson equation with a relative error of @xmath136 , for different @xmath55 . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we see that by increasing the order of the expansion in hermite polynomials , it is possible to reduce the computational time by several orders of magnitude ( up to six ) .",
    "these data refer specifically to the solution of the poisson equation , but we have reasons to believe that similar conclusions would hold for other partial differential equations with a kinetic - theory background , including many linear non - linear partial differential equations of great relevance in many branches of modern science .      in order to gain information about the performance of this approach , as compared with existing tools to solve the poisson equation , we have implemented simulations using the multi - grid ( mg ) method @xcite . the number of nodes in the mg simulations is denoted by @xmath7 , like for the lattice boltzmann method .",
    "fixing @xmath95 ( from eq .  ) , in table [ table2 ] we show the relative errors per node , @xmath137 , together with the corresponding computational time .",
    "note that for @xmath74 , the mg method is faster than our approach , with the same second order accuracy . by increasing @xmath55 , however , the mg becomes increasingly faster , but also increasingly less accurate at a given grid size @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , in order to attain the same accuracy of the case @xmath56 on @xmath138 , the mg solver requires @xmath139 grid points , being still faster by about a factor @xmath140 .",
    "given that @xmath56 requires @xmath72 arrays , the lb memory saving is about a factor @xmath141 .",
    "these figures indicate that the present high - order lb poisson solver is consistently slower than mg , however it also takes correspondingly less memory to achieve high levels of accuracy .",
    "given that mg represents the state - of - the art for fast poisson solvers , these can be regarded as satisfactory results .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the present lb approach provides a viable option for the solution of poisson equation , in the sense of simplicity and possibly also in terms of memory demand at high accuracy .",
    "summarizing , we have studied the effect of higher order terms on the steady - state solution of the diffusion equation , using a lattice version of the boltzmann equation with high - order ( non - gaussian ) equilibria . for the numerical solution",
    ", we have developed a higher order lattice boltzmann model capable of reproducing up to seventh order moment of the equilibrium distribution and source charge .",
    "this permits to cancel exactly error terms up to seventh order . for the validation and study of our approach",
    ", we have solved the one - dimensional poisson equation , and found that the computational time to steady - state , at a prescribed level of accuracy , can be reduced by up to six orders of magnitude as compared to standard lb formulations .",
    "the six orders gain in computational time is due to the fact that higher order lattices permit to utilize much smaller grid sizes .",
    "moreover , since they contain a large number of discrete velocities , they allow faster propagation within the lattice , hence a correspondingly faster attainement of the steady - state . we have also compared with state - of - the art multigrid solvers , and found that high - order lb is nearly competitive in efficiency at a lower memory demand .",
