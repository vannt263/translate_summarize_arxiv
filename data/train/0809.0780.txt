    "over the past decade , we have made substantial progress in understanding how the very first stars in the universe formed .",
    "we know that in cosmological models based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) , the first stars will form in small protogalaxies , with total masses of the order of @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath6 , and that by a redshift @xmath7 we expect to find at least one such star - forming system per comoving @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we also know that although molecular hydrogen formation is inefficient , owing to the absence of dust , it is nevertheless the most abundant molecule in primordial gas , and is the main source of cooling at low densities , for temperatures between @xmath9  k and @xmath10  k.    furthermore , simple semi - analytical estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , later confirmed by detailed simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , demonstrate that @xmath0 provides enough cooling in these small protogalaxies to allow the gas to collapse under the influence of gravity on a timescale comparable to its gravitational free - fall timescale , thereby allowing star formation to occur . high - resolution , adaptive mesh simulations performed by @xcite have taught us much about the dynamics of the gas in these first protogalaxies .",
    "they consider gas cooled only by @xmath0 , and find that gravitational fragmentation of the collapsing gas is inefficient and that therefore only a single , massive star will form during the collapse .",
    "this will then suppress further star formation through a variety of feedbacks ( see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "other simulations , making simplifying assumptions such as the adoption of spherical symmetry , have allowed us to examine the importance of various aspects of the physics of the gas which are currently difficult to treat in the high - resolution adaptive mesh simulations ( for instance , the development of large optical depths in the rotational and vibrational lines of @xmath0 at high densities ; see e.g.@xcite ) .    much of the theoretical uncertainty that remains concerns the behaviour of dense gas during the later stages of gravitational collapse , and during the period of accretion that follows the formation of the first protostar .",
    "there is much that is still unknown here  for instance , a complete understanding of the mechanism by which the collapsing gas loses much of its initial angular momentum still eludes us  but in this paper we intend to focus on one relatively simple aspect : the identification of the dominant coolant(s ) in the dense gas .",
    "as previously noted , @xmath0 cooling has long been known to dominate at low densities , and it is frequently assumed that it also dominates at high densities . however , it is not at all obvious that this is actually the case .",
    "two factors dramatically reduce the effectiveness of @xmath0 as a coolant in high density gas .",
    "the first is the fact that the excited rotational and vibrational levels of @xmath0 have small radiative transition probabilities , and hence long radiative lifetimes ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this means that collisional de - excitation of excited @xmath0 becomes competitive with radiative de - excitation at fairly low gas densities ( @xmath12 ) , and so as the number density @xmath13 increases , the cooling rate of @xmath0 quickly reaches its local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) value , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the transition probability for a transition from @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the energy of this transition , @xmath18 is the number density of @xmath0 molecules in level @xmath19 , computed assuming lte , and where we sum over all bound levels @xmath20 and over all bound levels @xmath19 with energies greater than @xmath20 . in the lte limit , the cooling rate per @xmath0 molecule is independent of the gas density , and is largely determined by the size of the transition probabilities . since these are small , the lte cooling rate is also small .",
    "consequently , at high gas densities , a molecular species whose excited states have much shorter radiative lifetimes than those of @xmath0 will provide far more cooling _ per molecule _",
    "than @xmath0 .",
    "the second factor reducing the effectiveness of @xmath0 cooling at very large @xmath13 is the fact that the gas eventually becomes optically thick in the cores of the main rovibrational lines of @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of this can not currently be treated fully in three - dimensional simulations , due to the high computational cost of solving the resulting radiative transfer problem , but it has been modeled accurately in simple spherically symmetric , one - dimensional simulations @xcite and in an approximate fashion in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "these studies confirm that at densities @xmath21 , optical depth effects significantly suppress @xmath0 cooling .",
    "together , these factors combine to render @xmath0 a fairly ineffective coolant in high density gas , despite the fact that at @xmath22 , several three - body @xmath0 formation reactions @xmath23 rapidly convert almost all of the hydrogen in the gas to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to ask whether cooling from any of the other molecular species present in the gas will become competitive with @xmath0 cooling at these densities .",
    "one obvious possibility is deuterated hydrogen , @xmath24 .",
    "its excited rotational and vibrational levels have radiative lifetimes that are about a factor of 100 shorter than those of @xmath0 , and so the @xmath24 cooling rate does not reach its lte limit until @xmath25 .",
    "it is also a far more effective coolant than @xmath0 at low temperatures ( @xmath26 ; see e.g. , @xcite ) . this is due primarily to the fact that radiative transitions can occur between rotational levels with odd and even values of @xmath27 , allowing cooling to occur through the @xmath28 transition .",
    "the corresponding odd @xmath29 even transitions in the case of @xmath0 represent conversions from ortho-@xmath0 to para-@xmath0 or vice versa , and are highly forbidden .",
    "furthermore , at low temperatures the ratio of @xmath24 to @xmath0 can be significantly enhanced with respect to the cosmological d : h ratio by chemical fractionation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the role of @xmath24 cooling in early protogalaxies has been investigated by a number of authors . in the case of the earliest generation of protogalaxies , which form from very cold neutral gas that is never heated to more than a few thousand k during the course of the galaxy formation process",
    ", @xmath24 cooling appears to be unimportant , as the collapsed gas does not become cold enough for sufficient fractionation to occur to make @xmath24 cooling dominant @xcite .",
    "the situation is rather different , however , in primordial gas cooling from an initially ionized state . in that case",
    "more @xmath0 is formed , allowing the gas to cool to a lower temperature , at which point fractionation becomes effective and @xmath24 cooling rapidly becomes dominant ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the initial ionization required is much larger than that expected to be present in the earliest protogalaxies .",
    "another molecule to have attracted considerable attention is lithium hydride , lih .",
    "this molecule has a very large dipole moment , @xmath30 @xcite , and consequently its excited levels have very short radiative lifetimes . therefore , despite the very low lithium abundance in primordial gas ( @xmath31 , by number ; see @xcite ) , it was thought for a time that lih would dominate the cooling at very high densities ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , accurate quantal calculations of the rate of formation of @xmath32 by radiative association @xcite @xmath33 have shown that the rate is much smaller than was initially assumed , while recent work by @xcite has shown that the reaction @xmath34 has no activation energy and so will be an efficient destruction mechanism for @xmath32 for as long as some atomic hydrogen remains in the gas .",
    "consequently , the amount of lithium hydride present in the gas is predicted to be very small , even at very high densities , and so @xmath32 cooling is no longer believed to be important @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath24 or @xmath32 , the various molecular ions present in the gas , such as @xmath2 , @xmath1 or @xmath3 , have attracted little attention .",
    "some early work on @xmath2 cooling in ionized primordial gas can be found in @xcite , and its possible importance in hot , highly ionized conditions has recently been re - emphasized by @xcite , but aside from this , there has been little exploration of the role that cooling from these species might play in the evolution of primordial gas , presumably because the abundances of these species are expected to be small .",
    "it is this absence that the current paper attempts to rectify .",
    "we present here the results of a set of simulations of the chemical and thermal evolution of gravitationally collapsing primordial gas .",
    "these simulations use a very simple one - zone dynamical model for the gas , but couple this with a detailed chemical network and a comprehensive model of the various heating and cooling processes at work .",
    "besides the coolants considered above , we include the effects of cooling from ( in no particular order ) @xmath2 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath1 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we focus in particular on the possible role of @xmath1 .",
    "this ion has a very large number of excited rotational and vibrational levels that are energetically accessible at the temperatures of interest in primordial gas , and its vibrational levels have much shorter radiative lifetimes than those of @xmath0 or @xmath24 . in lte ,",
    "its cooling rate per molecule is roughly @xmath47 times larger than that of @xmath0 .",
    "it is known to be an important coolant in planetary atmospheres @xcite and may also be an effective coolant in high density primordial gas @xcite . unlike ions such as @xmath2 or @xmath3 , it does not react with @xmath0 , and is not easily destroyed by collisions with @xmath4 , and so its abundance in high density gas should be large compared to the other molecular ions included in our model .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we outline the numerical method used to simulate the thermal and chemical evolution of the protostellar gas . the chemical reactions included in the model are discussed in  3 , and the thermal processes , in particular @xmath1 cooling , are discussed in  4 .",
    "we present the results of our simulations in  5 and close with a brief discussion in  6 .",
    "we treat the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas using a one - zone model , in which the density is assumed to evolve as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the free - fall timescale of the gas and where @xmath50 is an adjustable constant . in most of our simulations ,",
    "we set @xmath51 , corresponding to free - fall collapse , but in a few runs we examine the effect of slowing down the collapse by setting @xmath52 ( see  [ res : dyn ] for details ) .",
    "to follow the temperature evolution , we solve the energy equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the internal energy density , @xmath55 is the thermal pressure , @xmath56 is the total cooling rate ( which includes contributions from both radiative and chemical cooling , as outlined in  [ cool ] ) and @xmath57 is the total heating rate . since the temperature evolution is strongly coupled to the chemical evolution , we solve equation  [ en_eq ] simultaneously with the chemical rate equations using the dvode implicit ordinary differential equation solver @xcite . to model the chemistry we use an extensive chemical network consisting of 392 reactions among 30 atomic and molecular species",

    "tables  [ chemtab_ci][cr_pd_tab ] in appendix a list the reactions included in this network , broken down by the type of process involved .",
    "these tables also give details of the rate coefficient or rate adopted for each reaction and the source of the data . in these tables and elsewhere in the paper",
    ", @xmath58 is the gas temperature in k , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the temperature in units of ev .",
    "( note that we assume , both here and throughout , that the kinetic temperature of the electrons is the same as that of the atoms and molecules ) .    for many of these species",
    ", we followed the full time - dependent , non - equilibrium chemistry , but in some cases  the ions @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath2 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 and @xmath46  chemical equilibrium is reached very rapidly , on a timescale of the order of @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a characteristic destruction rate coefficient and @xmath13 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei . at the gas densities considered in this work ( @xmath66 in the majority of our simulations ) , this chemical equilibrium timescale for these rapidly reacting ions is orders of magnitude smaller than the free - fall timescale of the gas , which is approximately @xmath67 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to use the equilibrium abundances for these ions .",
    "some of the species remaining in our non - equilibrium model may also be close to chemical equilibrium during a large portion of the collapse , but are included in the non - equilibrium treatment because we can not be sure that they always remain in equilibrium .",
