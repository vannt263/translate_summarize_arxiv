    "the lightest resonance in qcd with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , @xmath13 , is the @xmath0 or @xmath1 resonance @xcite .",
    "its connection with chiral symmetry has been stressed since the sixties in the linear sigma model @xcite , while its tight relation with the non - linear sigma model was realized in the nineties . in this respect",
    "there have been several papers that clearly connect this resonance with chiral dynamics of the two - pion system .",
    "one has first to mention the works of truong and collaborators @xcite who first emphasized the important role played by the null isospin ( @xmath14 ) @xmath6-wave @xmath5 final state interactions in several processes giving rise to a strong numerical impact on the estimations based on current algebra technique or chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "a notoriously improved comparison with experiment was then obtained , _",
    "e.g. _ for @xmath15 decays @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , scalar and pion vector form factors @xcite and @xmath5 scattering @xcite .",
    "these works stress the role of the right - hand or unitarity cut and make use of a method to resum unitarity based on the expansion of the inverse of a form factor or scattering amplitude .",
    "this is the so called inverse amplitude method ( iam ) , that in the end is analogous to a padd method of resummation . within this technique",
    "the @xmath0 pole was first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , together with the @xmath17 and @xmath18 resonances in the @xmath19-waves .",
    "however , due to the lack of coupled channels , no further light scalar resonances were generated , in particular the @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "independently , the @xmath0 resonance pole was also obtained simultaneously in ref .",
    "@xcite , together with the @xmath22 @xmath20 and @xmath21 resonances .",
    "the associated amplitudes were determined by solving the bethe - salpeter equation taking as potential the lowest order chpt lagrangian .",
    "only one free parameter ( a natural sized cut - off ) was involved .",
    "later on , when the iam was extended to coupled channels @xcite , it was possible to obtain in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 resonances altogether , that is , the whole nonet of the lightest scalar resonances @xcite , together with the nonet of the lightest vector resonances",
    ".    the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on solving a bethe - salpeter equation , was put on more general grounds in ref .",
    "@xcite by applying the n / d method @xcite . in this way",
    ", it is possible to include higher orders in the chiral counting @xcite as well as explicit resonant fields @xcite , if required .",
    "later works based on this scheme are refs .",
    "@xcite . with this approach @xcite one builds a unitarized meson - meson scattering amplitude by solving the n / d equation in an algebraic way so that an approximate solution is obtained by treating perturbatively the crossed cuts . as a result",
    ", the chpt expansion is reproduced order by order , while the unitarity cut is resummed @xcite . in this respect",
    ", one should stress that the crossed cuts can be treated perturbatively for the isoscalar @xmath5 @xmath6-wave .",
    "its size was estimated to be smaller than 10% in ref .",
    "@xcite along the physical region for energies up to around 1  gev .",
    "indeed , different approaches with various degrees of sophistication provide very similar values for the @xmath0 pole resonance parameters , mass and width . either by employing just the leading order ( lo ) chpt @xcite ( without left - hand cut at all ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite or next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath24lo ) @xcite .",
    "in these two later references the left - hand cut is included as calculated by chpt at one and two - loop orders , respectively .",
    "the fact that the results are very similar clearly indicates that the left - hand cut is indeed a perturbation .",
    "the @xmath0 pole positions in @xmath11 , with @xmath25 the total center of mass energy squared , obtained in these works are : @xmath26  mev @xcite , @xmath27  mev @xcite and @xmath28  mev @xcite . in the following",
    "we identify the mass and half width of the @xmath0 resonance from the pole position as @xmath29 .",
    "more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the solution of the roy equations @xcite and chpt at two - loops @xcite , obtained the value @xmath30  mev .",
    "the roy equations implement crossing symmetry exactly , while the previous references @xcite do it perturbatively .",
    "the fact that all these pole positions for the @xmath0 lie rather close to each other ( particularly one can say that convergence is reached very accurately for the real part ) is another indication for the correctness of treating crossed - channel dynamics perturbatively , as done in the framework of refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , to our mind , both schemes are complementary because the roy equations need for their implementation of the knowledge of large amount of data in several partial waves up to high energies , which is affected by systematics errors in experiments ( many of them old ones ) and also in theory ( _ e.g. _ high energy extrapolations ) , not always well under control .",
    "let us also mention that all these analyses neglect altogether the inelasticity due to the @xmath31 channel in @xmath5 @xmath6-waves so that , up to the opening of the @xmath32 threshold at around 1  gev , no inelasticity is assumed .",
    "the @xmath31 channel was approached in ref .  @xcite as @xmath33 and @xmath34 states ( with their couplings to all the channels predicted from chiral dynamics ) and found the @xmath0 pole at @xmath35  mev .- wave resonances quoted in the pdg @xcite from @xmath5 threshold up to 2  gev .",
    "a coherent picture of the scalar sector dynamics and spectroscopy then arose , including the identification of the lightest scalar glueball . ]",
    "this pole position is quite close to those in the previous references and compatible with the result @xmath36  mev from ref .",
    "thus , since the pole positions of refs .",
    "@xcite lie so close to each other we could conclude that our present knowledge on the pole position of the @xmath0 resonance is quite precise and , furthermore , we understand the underlying physics at the hadronic level .    between earlier approaches to the previous discussed results based on chpt concerning the lightest scalars , we have refs .",
    "@xcite within the mit bag model that already in the late seventies predicted a complete nonet of four - quark @xmath37 resonances ( comprising the @xmath0 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 ) , with @xmath38  mev and @xmath39  mev .",
    "the four - quark nature of the lightest scalars is also favored in refs .",

    "@xcite . the important role played by two - meson unitarity for understanding the scalar sector for @xmath42",
    "gev was also stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( a similar approach was later followed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , employing a unitarized chiral quark model , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , within the jlich meson - exchange models .",
    "considerations based on increasing the qcd number of colors , @xmath43 , were exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite , showing that the @xmath0 resonance has a non - standard @xmath43 dependence .",
    "this can be done more safely for @xmath44 , not too large , while statements for @xmath45 depend much more on fine details of the approach @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules were also applied for the study of the lightest scalar meson , _",
    "e.g. _ in refs .",
    "it is argued too that the @xmath0 resonance is the chiral partner of the pion @xcite and the way in which the @xmath0 pole evolves when approaching the chiral symmetry restoration limit is different according to the nature of this resonance @xcite .    from an experimental point of view new interest",
    "is triggered on the @xmath0 resonance from recent high - statistics results , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath46 where a conspicuous peak is seen @xcite . indeed , this decay mode was the first clear experimental signal of a @xmath0 resonance @xcite .",
    "another marked peak around the @xmath0 energy region is also observed in several heavy meson decays .",
    "_ e.g. _ it was observed with high statistical significance in @xmath47 @xcite . both types of decays present a strong peak in the @xmath0 mass energy region because the absence of the adler zero in the pion scalar form factor , as explained in refs .",
    "another field of increasing activity , both experimental @xcite and theoretical , concerns the fusion of two photons into a pair of pions and from there to extract the width of the @xmath0 to @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this is also expected to shed light on the nature of the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "the relative strength of the @xmath0 coupling to @xmath32 compared to @xmath49 is also taken as an important property in order to disentangle between different models for the nature of the @xmath0 meson ( @xmath50 , four - quarks , glueball or @xmath5-molecule ) , as stressed in ref .",
    "this reference points out that the not so much suppressed coupling of the @xmath0 to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , as compared with that to @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 @xcite , is a key ingredient to advocate for a gluonium nature of the @xmath0 meson . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , a simple @xmath50 interpretation of the @xmath0 fails to explain the large width of the @xmath0 while a four - quark scenario has difficulties to explain its large coupling to @xmath51 .",
    "it is then worth emphasizing that the @xmath56-matrices obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite also predict a ratio for the @xmath0 couplings to @xmath51 and @xmath53 in perfect agreement with the value above of refs .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath57 from the average collected in ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , in our case this stems from the dynamical generation of the @xmath0 resonance from the goldstone boson dynamics associated to the strong scalar isoscalar @xmath5 interaction .",
    "we also stress that this approach has been confronted with a large amount of data from different reactions , both scattering and production experiments , in most of the reactions already quoted in this introduction .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to show that the often identification of dynamically generated resonances from the interactions of two mesons ( pions in our case ) as meson - meson molecules is misleading . as we show here , depending on the meson mass",
    ", one can have situations where the size of a dynamically generated meson - meson resonance is certainly too small to be qualified as a two - meson molecule .",
    "indeed , its size could be as small as that of one of the mesons involved in their formation .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0 is such a tight compact object clearly hints that the two pions pack so much that it is not meaningful anymore to keep their identities separately . at this stage",
    ", a four quark compact resonance seems a more appropriate picture .",
    "this is also supported by the @xmath43 evolution of the @xmath0-pole trajectory which is clearly at odds with the expectations for a purely @xmath58 or glueball resonance , but in the lines of what it is expected for a meson - meson or four quark resonance @xcite . however , by increasing the pion mass the @xmath0 resonance pole tends to follow the two pion threshold , and when it is close to the latter its size increases , becoming a spread object .",
    "this is a clear indication for the molecular character of the @xmath0 for large enough pion masses , @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , let us also emphasize that our work is the first calculation of the size of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "this is a novel way to study its nature in the literature .",

    "then , we determine the quadratic scalar radius of the @xmath0 and then have some information on the size of this resonance . we stress that this radius is pretty small , around 0.5  fm indicating that the @xmath0 is a compact object .",

    "the two - point function is : @xmath503 and analogously it is evaluated in dimensional regularization , with the result @xmath504 with @xmath505 . since the function is divergent and @xmath506-dependent , we define the subtracted function , @xmath507 , @xmath508 this is the function that will appear in the amplitudes , because the term subtracted cancels out with the alike terms in the loops and the chiral counterterms .",

    "since the pole of the @xmath0 resonance appears in the unphysical riemann sheet , we need to calculate the amplitudes @xmath263 in this sheet .",

    "<S> in this work the nature of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 resonance is discussed by evaluating its quadratic scalar radius , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to have a quantitative estimate for the size of this resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that the @xmath0 resonance is a compact object with @xmath3 @xmath4 . within our approach , employing unitary chiral perturbation theory , the @xmath0 is a dynamically generated resonance that stems from the pion - pion interactions . given its small size we conclude that the two pions inside the resonance are merged . a four - quark picture is then more appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the pion mass increases , for pion masses somewhat above 400  mev , the picture of a two - pion molecule is the appropriate one . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 is then a spread @xmath5 bound state . </S>",
    "<S> these results are connected with other recent works that support a non standard nature of the @xmath0 as well , while fulfilling strong qcd constraints , as well as with lattice qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> we offer a detailed study of the low - energy @xmath6-wave @xmath5 scattering data from where we extract our values for the threshold parameters of @xmath6-wave @xmath5 phase shifts , the @xmath7 chiral perturbation theory low energy constants as well as the @xmath0 pole position . from the comparison with other accurate determinations in the literature we obtain the average values for the isospin 0 @xmath6-wave @xmath5 threshold parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath9  @xmath10 , and for the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0 pole position in @xmath11 , @xmath12  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the quark mass dependence of the size of the @xmath0 , its mass and width are considered too . </S>",
    "<S> the latter agree accurately with a previous lattice qcd calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the mass of this resonance tends to follow the threshold of two pions is a clear indication that the @xmath0 is a dynamically generated meson - meson resonance . </S>"
