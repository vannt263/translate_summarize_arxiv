    "given a closed riemannian manifold @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , the yamabe problem concerns the existence of constant scalar curvature metrics conformal to @xmath6 .",
    "solutions to this problem can be characterized variationally as critical points of the hilbert - einstein functional restricted to the conformal class @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the proof that such a solution always exist is a consequence of the successive works of yamabe  @xcite , trudinger  @xcite , aubin  @xcite and schoen  @xcite , and provides minimizers of the hilbert - einstein functional in each conformal class .",
    "for instance , einstein metrics are minima of the functional in their conformal class .",
    "in fact , except for round metrics on spheres , they are the _ unique _ metrics in their conformal class having constant scalar curvature , see obata  @xcite .",
    "anderson  @xcite proved that , generically , the hilbert - einstein functional restricted to a conformal class has a unique critical point .",
    "nevertheless , there are many other families of constant scalar curvature metrics that are critical points of this functional , but not necessarily minimizers .",
    "this raises the following interesting problem :    given a closed riemannian manifold @xmath4 , classify all critical points of the hilbert - einstein functional restricted to the conformal class @xmath7 $ ] .    in this paper ,",
    "we partially answer the above question when @xmath4 is the sphere @xmath8 equipped with a homogeneous metric ( recall that any such metric is a solution to the yamabe problem ) . before giving details about our results , let us recall a few previous works on the above question .",
    "schoen  @xcite proved existence of an increasing number of solutions , with large energy and morse index , in the conformal class of the product @xmath9 of round spheres , as the radius @xmath10 of the circle tends to infinity . a remarkable result regarding non - uniqueness of solutions",
    "is due to pollack  @xcite , that proved existence of arbitrarily @xmath11-small perturbations of any given metric , with arbitrarily large number of solutions in its conformal class .",
    "regarding perturbations of the round metric on the sphere , ambrosetti and malchiodi  @xcite obtained the existence of at least @xmath12 solutions for certain deformations .",
    "later , berti and malchiodi  @xcite obtained the existence of a sequence of unbounded solutions ( in the @xmath13 sense ) among other multiplicity results , also for perturbations of the round metric .",
    "recently , lima , piccione and zedda  @xcite studied the family of metrics on a product @xmath14 of compact riemannian manifolds obtained by rescaling one of the factors , similarly to the case of @xmath9 mentioned above , obtaining _ bifurcation _ of solutions .    in a natural continuation of the latter , we study bifurcation of solutions from families of homogeneous metrics on spheres .",
    "more precisely , our main results ( theorems  [ thm : s2n+1 ] , [ thm : s4n+3 ] and [ thm : s15 ] ) distinguish homogeneous metrics that are a _",
    "bifurcation point _",
    "( i.e. , an accumulation point of other solutions conformal to homogeneous solutions ) from homogeneous metrics that are _ locally rigid _",
    "( i.e. , not a bifurcation point )",
    ". this local rigidity means uniqueness in some neighborhood inside its conformal class . for a precise definition of these notions ,",
    "see definition  [ def : biflocrig ] .",
    "thus , these results completely describe the arrangement of the critical points of the hilbert - einstein functional on conformal classes of homogeneous metrics on @xmath8 in a vicinity ( in the @xmath15 topology ) of the set of homogeneous metrics .",
    "we note that this was already known only for the round metric , which belongs to all families of homogeneous metrics and it is trivially a bifurcation value for all of them .",
    "homogeneous metrics on spheres were classified by ziller  @xcite in 1982 .",
    "all such metrics arise as a deformation of the round metric by scaling it in the direction of the fibers of a hopf fibration ( these manifolds are also often referred to as _ berger spheres _ ) .",
    "more precisely , the total space of each hopf fibration @xmath16 admits a family of homogeneous metrics , depending on one parameter @xmath17 , obtained by scaling the round metric by a factor @xmath18 in the subbundle tangent to the hopf fibers .",
    "this gives rise to :    * a @xmath0-parameter family of @xmath1-homogeneous metrics on @xmath19 ; * a @xmath0-parameter family of @xmath2-homogeneous metrics on @xmath20 ; * a @xmath0-parameter family of @xmath3-homogeneous metrics on @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , @xmath20 carries a @xmath22-parameter family of @xmath2-homogeneous metrics given by rescaling any left - invariant metric on the fibers @xmath23 in the same fashion .",
    "any homogeneous metric on @xmath8 is isometric to one of the above . in this paper",
    ", we deal with metrics in each of the three @xmath0-parameter families @xmath24 and @xmath25 , since bifurcation and local rigidity phenomena are naturally cast for @xmath0-parameter families .",
    "we can now describe our results in more detail . we prove ( theorem  [ thm : s2n+1 ] ) that every metric @xmath26 , except the round metric @xmath27 , is a locally rigid solution to the yamabe problem .",
    "we also prove ( theorems  [ thm : s4n+3 ] and [ thm : s15 ] ) that , for each of the two families @xmath28 and @xmath25 , there exist corresponding decreasing sequences @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath310,1]$ ] that start at @xmath32 and converge to @xmath33 as @xmath34 , such that    * @xmath28 ( respectively @xmath25 ) is a bifurcation point if @xmath35 ( respectively @xmath36 ) for some @xmath37 ; * @xmath28 ( respectively @xmath25 ) is locally rigid if @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath40 are locally the only critical points of the hilbert - einstein functional on their conformal classes ( hence locally the only solutions to the yamabe problem ) ; while for @xmath41 and @xmath42 there are infinitely many bifurcating branches of critical points issuing from the homogeneous branch at @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( hence infinitely many other solutions to the yamabe problem that accumulate on homogeneous solutions ) .",
    "moreover , there is a _",
    "break of symmetry _ at all these bifurcation values , i.e. , the bifurcating branches consist of non - homogeneous metrics .",
    "such different behaviors of @xmath28 and @xmath25 compared to @xmath26 are in part explained by the fact that the scalar curvature function @xmath45 is bounded from above , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 blow up as @xmath48 .",
    "the round metric of @xmath8 belongs to all three families @xmath24 and @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath49 . in the conformal class of this metric",
    ", it was already well - known that the critical points of the hilbert - einstein functional form a manifold of dimension @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that the round metric is a _ trivial _",
    "bifurcation point in all three families .",
    "this follows from the fact that the round sphere is the unique compact riemannian manifold to admit non - isometric conformal transformations ( see obata  @xcite ) and given any such transformation @xmath51 , the pull - back of the round metric by @xmath52 has constant scalar curvature ( see schoen  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec 2 ) ) . in this way , to each non - isometric conformal transformation of @xmath8 corresponds a solution to the yamabe problem that is conformal to the round metric .",
    "our results can also be understood from the viewpoint of dynamical systems , where _",
    "bifurcation _ means a topological or qualitative change in the structure of the set of fixed points of a @xmath0-parameter family of systems when varying this parameter .",
    "critical points of the hilbert - einstein functional in a conformal class @xmath7 $ ] are fixed points of the so - called _ yamabe flow _ , the corresponding @xmath53-gradient flow of the hilbert - einstein functional , which gives a dynamical system in this conformal class .",
    "the bifurcation results above mentioned can be hence interpreted as a local change in the set of fixed points of the yamabe flow near homogeneous metrics ( which are always fixed points ) when varying the conformal class @xmath7 $ ] with @xmath6 in one of the families @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "an interesting question would be to study the dynamics near these new fixed points for @xmath54 ( respectively @xmath55 ) .",
    "we also obtain corollaries to our main results regarding _ global _ uniqueness and multiplicity of solutions to the yamabe problem in the conformal classes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "namely , we prove that the set of @xmath17 such that there exists a _",
    "unique _ unit volume constant scalar curvature metric in the conformal class of @xmath26 is open ( see proposition  [ prop : stability ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the other families @xmath28 and @xmath25 . in the opposite direction",
    ", we have results on the multiplicity of solutions in the conformal classes of the families @xmath28 and @xmath25 that admit bifurcation .",
    "more precisely , we prove existence of _ at least @xmath22 _ different unit volume constant scalar curvature metrics in the conformal class of @xmath28 for @xmath56 in an infinite subset of @xmath310,1[$ ] with @xmath33 in its closure , see proposition  [ prop : mult ] . again , the same holds for @xmath25 .",
    "the techniques to prove all of the above results are based on the variational characterization of solutions to the yamabe problem as critical points of the hilbert - einstein functional on conformal classes .",
    "most of the abstract results used appeared in the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "there are two such abstract results .",
    "the first ( proposition  [ prop : localrigidity ] ) gives a sufficient condition for local rigidity at a critical point using the implicit function theorem .",
    "the second ( proposition  [ prop : bifmorseindex ] ) gives sufficient conditions for existence of a bifurcation , based on the classic bifurcation result that a change in the morse index implies bifurcation , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm ii.7.3 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 2.1 ) .",
    "thus , in order to prove the results claimed , we have to analyze the second variation of the hilbert - einstein functional at every metric - parameter family of metrics by @xmath57 ( so that in the applications mentioned @xmath57 will be replaced by @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . ]",
    "@xmath57 of the @xmath0-parameter families of homogeneous metrics on @xmath8 .",
    "using the second variation formula , this amounts to computing the spectrum of the laplacian @xmath58 of @xmath57 and the scalar curvature @xmath59 .",
    "more precisely , a critical point @xmath57 is degenerate if and only if @xmath60 and @xmath61 is an eigenvalue of @xmath58 ; and the morse index of a critical point @xmath57 is the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath58 that are less than @xmath61 .",
    "since the above @xmath0-parameter families @xmath57 of homogeneous metrics on @xmath8 are the obtained by scaling the fibers of riemannian submersions with totally geodesic fibers , the spectrum of the laplacian @xmath58 of @xmath57 is well - understood ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "roughly , it consists of linear combinations ( that depend on @xmath56 ) of eigenvalues of the original metric on the total space , the round sphere , with eigenvalues of the fibers , which are also round spheres . since the spectrum of round spheres is well - known , computing the spectrum of @xmath58",
    "is reduced to identifying which combinations of eigenvalues occur as eigenvalues of @xmath58 .",
    "this depends heavily on the global geometry of the submersion , but , in the cases studied , can be tackled using observations of tanno  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we explicitly compute the first positive eigenvalue @xmath62 of @xmath57 . combining this knowledge of the spectrum of @xmath58 with the formula for the scalar curvature of @xmath57",
    ", we are able to identify all degeneracy values of each @xmath0-parameter family @xmath57 , compute their the morse index and prove existence of bifurcation at all degeneracy values @xmath63 and local rigidity around @xmath57 for all other @xmath17 .",
    "we stress that although we only consider spheres , many of the theoretic aspects of our results are completely general to metrics @xmath57 obtained by scaling the fibers of any riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers . with a few other assumptions , it is possible to obtain similar bifurcation results on other such families whose fiber has positive scalar curvature .",
    "an infinite sequence of bifurcation values @xmath64 converging to zero is obtained via changes of the morse index when eigenvalues of the laplacian on the base manifold ( that are also eigenvalues of @xmath58 for all @xmath17 ) become smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "nevertheless , one has to deal with _",
    "compensations _ of eigenvalues crossing in the opposite direction with same multiplicity ( preventing the morse index from changing ) .",
    "a study of this compensation problem and applications are to appear in a forthcoming note by the authors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : var ] , we briefly recall the variational characterization of the yamabe problem , and establish the basic notions of bifurcation and local rigidity , as well as the abstract bifurcation criteria that will be used in the applications .",
    "the laplacians of a riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers are studied in section  [ sec : subm ] .",
