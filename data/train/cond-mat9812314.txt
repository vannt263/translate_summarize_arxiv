    "more then 10 years have passed since the introduction of the glass model in high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the model was originally used for the description of granular superconductors @xcite .",
    "but it became immediately clear that the glass behavior of the then new high-@xmath0 materials was not caused by the granular structure of the ceramic compounds ; rather the magnetic fields used in the experiments suggested that the microscopic origin of glassy behavior occurred at a length scale smaller than that of the grains @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the glass model .",
    "inspired by the recent study by tsuei and doderer @xcite of the charge confinement effect in cuprate superconductors , we link the intragrain inhomogeneities demanded in the glass theory to the microscopic concept of striped phase @xcite , and in particular to that of stripe _ domains _ @xcite which have recently become of wider interest to the high-@xmath0 community .",
    "the stripe domains are identified with the areas of constant phase in the glass theory .",
    "microscopically , tsuei and doderer used their charge confinement model @xcite to explain various generic features of the normal - state pseodogap , including the magnitude of the gap .",
    "such stripe domains may be described from first principles by a model such as the hubbard model , enabling an ab initio numerical calculation of intra - domain pairing properties such as the effective pairing temperature and pseudogap .    in @xcite a behavior reminiscent of spin glasses was detected , the quasi - de - almeida - thouless - line ( quasi at - line ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the magnetic field and @xmath3 the corresponding critical temperature or to be more precise the temperature below which metastable behavior occurs as seen in @xcite .",
    "the existence of the at - line was first seen as an evidence for glass behavior , but it turned out , that a totally different physical mechanism was the cause for the @xmath4 behavior @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the high-@xmath0 glass model @xcite lead to this conclusion .    the glass model can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the vector potential leading to @xcite @xmath8 in equation ( [ eqhglass ] ) to ( [ eqphases_2 ] ) @xmath9 is the elementary flux quantum , @xmath2 the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath10 is the phase of the superconducting wave function in an area or domain denoted by i ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the cartesian coordinates .",
    "furthermore @xmath13 is the coupling energy between two clusters according to @xcite taken identical in the simulations in @xcite , @xmath14 the line integral from cluster @xmath15 to @xmath16 , @xmath17 the sum over the nearest neighbors , and finally @xmath18 are the phase factors between cluster @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    as a result of the simulations in @xcite we consider figure  [ fig1 ] which is reproduced from @xcite and follow - up papers . because of the results of the simulations we had to conclude , that the origin of the glass behavior lies inside the grains , therefore also inside single crystals .",
    "the @xmath19 behavior was only reproduced in two dimensions , therefore the domains or areas of constant phase @xmath10 had to be located inside the cuo - planes , connected by weak links @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the size of the domains was also known . here",
    "we present a typical calculation of estimating the domain size with data available at the time of the publication of @xcite .",
    "as the magnetic field of reference we consider the upper critical field @xmath20 . in figure  [ fig2 ] we see @xmath20 in the phase diagram of equation ( [ eqatline ] ) , that @xmath21 .",
    "we should denote the @xmath22 was taken as unity as is normal in numerical simulations .",
    "for an estimation of the typical distance @xmath23 between two clusters , we consider a plaquette in figure  [ fig3 ] .    in the simulation @xmath24",
    "the idea is that the phase factors are equal , @xmath25 , for corresponding fields @xmath2 .",
    "( @xmath26 denoting @xmath18 used in simulation and @xmath27 correspondingly in experiment ) .",
    "therefore for @xmath28 we have @xmath29 . considering the experimental situation",
    "we refer to figure  1 in @xcite . there",
    "the magnetization or magnetic moment @xmath30 is plotted versus @xmath2 for various temperatures .",
    "considering the lowest temperature @xmath30 tends to zero at @xmath31 .",
    "therefore @xmath32 ( tesla ) in experiment with @xmath33 we find that @xmath34 and therefore @xmath35 .",
    "we wish to emphasize here , that the length scale of @xmath36 deduced from the glass picture is consistent with the length of the stripe domains seen in stm data @xcite , and roughly with that of the stripe width determined from neutron@xcite and ultraviolet photoemission@xcite data .",
    "we propose revision of the concept of clean , single crystal high temperature superconductor material to include the concept of striped phase  type inhomogeneity with associated ` glassy ' behavior .",
    "it should be noted , that the aging or memory effect in spin glasses was also detected @xcite .    at the end of this section",
    "we would like to counter a certain source of criticism concerning the glass model .",
    "ten years ago the community only considered the case of s - wave superconductivity . in the model @xmath37",
    "was chosen .",
    "the glass behavior as described in @xcite is totally dominated by frustration , which is caused by the @xmath18 s in equation ( [ eqhglass ] ) . in s",
    " wave superconductivity @xmath13 would not change sign and therefore not lead to additional frustration .",
    "this could be different in d  wave as pointed out by sigrist and rice @xcite .",
    "but the situation in the simulation of @xcite was , that only weak  correlated  disorder was chosen in the framework of the square lattice .",
    "this means the coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 in equation ( [ eqphases_2 ] ) were obtained by allowing a random displacement of the sites within a circle with radius @xmath38 of the lattice constant around the original site of the square lattice .",
    "therefore @xmath13 does not change sign even in the case of d - wave superconductivity .",
    "it should be pointed out that only this type of weak  correlated  disorder @xcite in two dimensions reproduced the @xmath19 behavior of the quasi at - line @xcite . at that time",
    "this result also lead to the prediction of a roughly two - dimensional plane - like anisotropy in the new superconductors @xcite .    summarizing",
    "the glass model picture of @xcite is still applicable to the correlated striped domains in the high-@xmath0 materials governing the d - wave symmetry and predicting the domain sizes correctly .",
    "as pointed out the microscopic mechanism has to be considered inside the domains . while glass papers did not deal with the mechanism , it was clear at that time , that , if the glass picture applies , the observed @xmath39 is @xmath40 of the glass model .",
    "the microscopic mechanism could easily have a much higher critical temperature @xmath41 .",
    "inside the domains we propose an electronic mechanism as suggested by the hubbard model ( hm ) or to be more precise the tthm @xcite @xmath42 with the kinetic @xmath43 and the potential part @xmath44 of the hamiltonian .",
    "we denote the creation operator for an electron with spin @xmath45 at site @xmath15 with @xmath46 , the corresponding annihilation operator with @xmath47 , and the number operator at site @xmath15 with @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is the hopping parameter only nonzero between nearest neighbors @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and next nearest sites @xmath50 ( @xmath52 ) , and finally @xmath53 is the interaction being repulsive in the high-@xmath0 case .",
    "the sites of the hm can be associated with the copper in the cuo - layers of the high-@xmath0 crystals @xcite .",
    "we published evidence for superconducting behavior with d - wave symmetry of the repulsive hm as early as 1994 @xcite .",
    "the d - wave symmetry in the superconducting state was subsequently established for the high-@xmath0 materials @xcite .    according to @xcite we use the ( vertex ) correlation function ( instead of the largest eigenvalue ) to provide evidence for superconductivity following the standard concept of off diagonal long range order @xcite . the vertex correlation function ( vertex cf )",
    "is defined for d@xmath54-waves as @xmath55 with the single particle correlation function @xmath56 for spin @xmath45 to extract the pairing effects in the two particle cf @xmath57 with the phase factors @xmath58 , @xmath59 to model the d@xmath54wave symmetry , the number of lattice points @xmath60 and the sum @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) over all nearest neighbors .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we reproduce the evidence for d - wave pairing in the repulsive hm using the projector quantum monte carlo ( pqmc ) technique .",
    "these simulations @xcite performed for the relatively weak  coupling value of @xmath63 , were found , with adequate numerical precautions , to be quite stable @xcite . for higher @xmath53values , e.g. @xmath64 , pqmc is found to encounter difficulties for larger than @xmath65 cluster sizes , and in fact evidence for finite plateaus was not reproduced , e.g.  @xcite , for large @xmath53 . however in the simulation technique of zhang , carlson and gubernatis @xcite the existence of the plateau phenomenon in the vertex cf ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) was confirmed .",
    "recent variational monte carlo results @xcite also confirm the existence of d - wave pairing in hubbard clusters .",
    "given the observation of plateaus supporting the existence of d  wave pairing in finite clusters , what are the implications for bulk superconductivity ?",
    "up to now it was thought necessary to scale the finite cluster calculations to infinite size in order to answer this question , which unfortunately presents difficulties as corrections to scaling are tremendously large compared to classical systems @xcite .",
    "however in view of the new stripe phase picture of the crystalline high-@xmath0 material , the simulated cluster can be reinterpreted as a single finite length stripe as seen in stm data @xcite , with typical dimensions of roughly @xmath66 unit cells , i.e. even smaller than our largest system sizes ( @xmath67 in @xcite ) . scaling to an infinite system",
    "is inappropriate as the pqmc cluster calculation is now descriptive of the actual quantum systems present in the crystal ( although they are treated as totally isolated ) .",
    "we consequently performed additional simulations for @xmath68 systems and now report the remarkable result that the plateau ( @xmath69 ) is about a factor of five higher than the plateau ( @xmath70 ) , figure  [ fig1204 ] .",
    "we averaged only the vertex cf @xmath71 in the large range regime of @xmath72 , i.e.  for the distances @xmath73 : @xmath74 with the number @xmath75 of points with @xmath76 .",
    "the qualitative behavior of our results is not influenced by the choice of @xmath77 as long as we suppress the short range correlations ( i.e.  @xmath78 ) .",
    "due to finite size effects ( see @xcite or in more detail @xcite ) the shape of the curves in respect to the filling in figure  [ fig1204 ] is influenced by @xmath79 and @xmath60 .",
    "considering the estimates of the microscopic critical temperature @xmath41 from grand canonical monte carlo ( gqmc ) @xcite simulations for the squared finite hubbard model in @xcite we can calculate @xmath41 from the @xmath80 versus @xmath81 plot .",
    "( @xmath81 is the inverse temperature . ) in figure  [ figgqmc ] we reproduce the results of the gqmc runs in @xcite .",
    "we take as estimate of @xmath82 the inflection point of the @xmath83 versus @xmath81 curve . from figure  [ figgqmc ]",
    "we deduce @xmath81 to be roughly @xmath84 . taking the hopping parameter @xmath85ev this corresponds to the temperature @xmath86 .    in figure  [ figgqmc ] all curves for different",
    "system sizes intersect at one temperature .",
    "even so the magnitude of the superconducting signal at low temperatures is increased for striped geometries , we expect from figure  [ figgqmc ] , that the value of @xmath82 should be approximately the same . here",
    "`` @xmath0 '' denotes the temperature where the correlation length equals the size of the systems .",
    "the first occurrence of preformed pairs in the finite hubbard clusters is at an even higher temperature @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath87 is at the onset of the susceptibility , i.e.  the temperature with the first occurrence of a nonzero susceptibility , in figure  [ figgqmc ] .",
    "a rough estimate is @xmath88 . with @xmath89ev",
    "this corresponds to @xmath90k , which is in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , that the range for @xmath91 is between @xmath92ev to 1ev as deduced from the experiments @xcite , thus this onset could be even at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "recently tsuei and doderer @xcite , have pointed out a possible interpretation of the pseudogap as a function of doping in cuprates as the finite size gap in the quasiparticle spectrum of the stripe phase domains .",
    "consistent with these ideas , we also identify the onset temperature @xmath87 with the pseudogap energy in the cuprate material .",
    "numerical values for the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state in finite size cluster systems were obtained already in 1995 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figspectr ] reproduces a typical case for an @xmath93 system as seen in lanczos diagonalization ( the finite size gap is large for the relatively small clusters for which lanczos diagonalization is tractable ) .",
    "the experimentally seen superconducting gap is different from the pseudogap ( finite size gap ) .",
    "it is the gap seen in the macroscopic glass model when the system as a whole becomes superconducting and the finite gaps are correlated .",
    "therefore it is clear that for the superconducting ( glass model ) gap a clear d - wave symmetry is seen @xcite while in the case of the pseudogap the effect is smeared out @xcite as the experiment  averages  over different ( finite size ) clusters and slight correlated disorder .",
    "the new view of high-@xmath0 superconductivity emerging from ref .",
    "@xcite and the present paper is based macroscopically on the interaction of nanoscopic , internally - paired , domains ( glass model ) and microscopically on the enhancement of pairing found to occur within metallic domains constituting the striped phase .",
    "the glass model for example enables us to identify the superconducting @xmath0 with the @xmath40 of the glass model .",
    "the microscopic model of a domain can be exploited , based on a hamiltonian such as the hubbard model , to estimate the relatively high temperature @xmath94 , the effective d - wave intra ",
    "domain pairing temperature , and to determine the pseudogap which is identified @xcite with the finite size quasiparticle gap within the domain . in earlier simulations",
    "we already found the first signs of pairing in the hubbard model at remarkably high temperatures @xcite .",
    "we find in the present work a very large enhancement of the intra ",
    "domain pairing when a non - square cluster morphology , @xmath68 , appropriate for the striped phase , is considered .",
    "a further consequence of the glass model is that all changes in @xmath39 are related to the interdomain coupling energy @xmath13 of equation  ( [ eqhglass ] ) and not to the microscopic mechanism described by the hubbard model .",
    "this means , e.g.  for the isotope effect , that when masses are altered by changing @xmath95 to @xmath96 , leading to the isotope exponent @xmath97 , the mass effect is entering through an isotope shift in @xmath13 or other glass model parameters .",
    "@xmath87 is probably not affected by the isotope effect @xcite .",
    "this would be another evidence for the combined glass model ",
    "hubbard model picture .",
    "in general we note that all experiments aiming at changing @xmath41 and therefore the microscopic mechanism have to be reinterpreted or redone in terms of @xmath13 of the glass model .",
    "future research could usefully concentrate on these weak links as seems to be occurring @xcite . only the glass model @xmath13 governs the @xmath39 ( in fact @xmath98 ) , and additionally the critical currents of the materials .",
    "progress in increasing @xmath0 or the critical current so far has been only accidental as the underlying glass behavior was not recognized .    in the scientific discussion",
    "about ten years ago it was concluded @xcite that the glass model would be only applicable to so called `` bad '' or `` glassy '' samples , i.e.  samples with weak links described by hamiltonian of equation ( [ eqhglass ] ) @xcite . at this time",
    "future research had to concentrate on `` good '' samples without weak links .",
    "here we argue again , that there are no `` good '' samples , as the @xmath39 s for all samples , single crystals , thin films , and ceramics , are for a definite composition about the same .",
    "it follows consequently that the @xmath39 is the @xmath40 of the glass model .",
    "furthermore it is clear as we deal with finite size domains ( or stripes ) that mean field theory and therefore bcs does not apply .",
    "future research could usefully emphasize the origin and manipulation of the weak links ( i.e.  the @xmath13 in the glass model ) between the domains ( or stripes ) .",
    "the authors would like to express their thanks to c.c . tsuei and t. doderer for making available a preprint of their work @xcite .",
