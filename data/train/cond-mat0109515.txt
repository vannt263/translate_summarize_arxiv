    "the totally antisymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) is one of the most studied models of nonequilibrium phenomena and has attracted both physicists and mathematicians .",
    "many of its features , including density profiles and currents , have been solved with periodic and open boundary conditions @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the so - called matrix formulation has provided an elegant way of exploring the properties of the steady state and has been successfully applied to get nontrivial results for the so - called shock solutions and for systems with several species of particles @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been used to solve the exact large deviation functional for the density profile in the case of open boundaries @xcite .",
    "tasep has been used to model free traffic flow @xcite and traffic jams induced by a crossing @xcite .",
    "traffic interpretation naturally raises a question of queue lengths in the system .",
    "although this problem is equivalent to one - dimensional site percolation in the canonical ensemble , if the steady state with usual exclusion dynamics and periodic boundary conditions is considered , being exactly solvable , it may still give some insight to problems , which are too complicated to solve in more complex situations .",
    "the statistics of the longest queue , or particle cluster as we shall call them , is interesting because it measures the size of the large deviations in the system .",
    "largest clusters in percolation in general dimension were recently studied by bazant @xcite .",
    "an exact solution , with limiting behaviors , is presented in this article for the one - dimensional exclusion process . in exclusion processes , one has also the possibility of changing the microscopic dynamics , which leads to percolation problems with different types of cluster statistics .",
    "for example , a model for reckless drivers , who are trying to escape from their chasers is considered in the present article .",
    "we show that this dynamics results in poisson statistics for the cluster sizes , which in turn makes the properties of the largest cluster very different from those in the case of the usual tasep dynamics .",
    "tasep is also related to two other well - known nonequilibrium systems , namely interface growth and directed polymers in random media @xcite . in particular , the cluster properties are translated to the excursion properties of the growing interface and the largest clusters measure the long excursions before turning back .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secsystem ] , we present the basic definitions and the mapping between tasep and the so - called zero - range process . the properties of clusters in stationary tasep are studied using this mapping in sec .",
    "[ sectasep ] .",
    "in particular , we present analytical results for the largest particle and hole clusters in secs .",
    "[ secasepemaxx ] and [ secfisher - tippett ] . in sec .",
    "[ secasy ] extremal statistics of clusters for tasep with the modified dynamics is considered .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ secdisc ] we discuss a related model of interface growth .",
    "[ secsystem ]    the model system we analyze in secs .",
    "[ sectasep ] and  [ secasy ] is the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) with @xmath0 particles hopping to the right in a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath1 sites , where @xmath1 is an even number , with periodic boundary conditions . for convenience ( see below ) , we first restrict @xmath2 the dynamics , however , differs from that of the ordinary tasep .",
    "we introduce another parameter @xmath3 , which for @xmath4 makes the hopping probability to depend on the length of the queue behind the particle in question as follows : after randomly picking an occupied site , check how many occupied sites there are in between the chosen site and the next empty site .",
    "if this number is less than or equal to @xmath5 , the rightmost particle in the cluster makes a move to the right - otherwise nothing happens .",
    "now the case @xmath6 is clearly the usual tasep . in the present article ,",
    "we concentrate mainly on the cluster length properties of the two cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we shall also comment briefly on a model of interface growth , where the deposited particles always relax to the local minimum , which is equivalent to a certain symmetrization of the @xmath7 case .",
    "many properties of the exclusion process can be accessed by using the mapping @xcite to the zero - range process introduced in ref .",
    "the mass variable @xmath8 , @xmath9 , of the zero - range process is the number of particles between @xmath10 and @xmath11 hole in tasep . since in tasep",
    "there are @xmath0 particles and @xmath12 holes on a ring of @xmath1 sites , there will be @xmath12 mass variables each attaining integer values from zero to @xmath0 with the constraint that @xmath13 .",
    "a jump of a particle in tasep corresponds to a change @xmath14 for some @xmath15 .",
    "this way tasep is reduced to the problem with @xmath0 particles hopping to the right on a lattice of @xmath12 sites , now with multiple occupancy allowed .",
    "this mapping is , however , not one - to - one , because there are @xmath16 tasep configuration corresponding to one configuration of the mass variables .",
    "for example , the number of all mass variable configurations equals the number of solutions of the equation @xmath17 in non - negative integers .",
    "this number is @xmath18 . but",
    "@xmath19 , which equals the number of all corresponding tasep configurations , i.e.  the number of random walk paths from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "note that without the restriction of eq .",
    "( [ rhorestricted ] ) this relation between the numbers of configurations would have applied on average only .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the joint stationary distribution of the zero - range process corresponding to tasep with general @xmath5 is the product of the marginal measures of the individual sites . for the cases @xmath6 and @xmath22 , however , the stationary state is particularly simple and can be constructed in a straightforward way .",
    "it is general knowledge that the stationary distribution of tasep on a ring of @xmath1 sites is the uniform distribution @xcite , the probability of each distinct configuration being @xmath23 .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that the transition probability to a given state equals the transition probability from the state in question to other states , which makes the transition matrix doubly stochastic @xcite .",
    "the mapping from tasep to the zero - range process being one - to - one up to a multiplicative constant , the stationary distribution of the zero - range process corresponding to @xmath6 is also uniform .    due to the translational invariance of our model system",
    "the mass variables @xmath8 are identically distributed and the general behavior is described by local expectations . the stationary distribution for size @xmath24 of the @xmath25 cluster in tasep can then be expressed in terms of the stationary mass variable distribution by @xmath26 next we use translational invariance and the uniformity of measures to conclude that eq .",
    "( [ pxkpz ] ) equals the number of solutions to @xmath27 where @xmath8 s are non - negative integers and @xmath28 , divided by the difference of @xmath29 and the number of solutions to eq .",
    "( [ m_n-1 ] ) with @xmath30 .",
    "therefore @xmath31 note that one could have derived this result also by simply counting the random walk paths starting with exactly @xmath32 steps up and ending with a down step and normalizing this number by the number of random walk paths with the first step up and the last step down . from eq .",
    "( [ probx_i = k ] ) we immediately obtain the limiting distribution for the cluster lengths , @xmath33 in agreement with the fact @xcite that in an infinite system size the measure for tasep is the product measure .",
    "the expected cluster size is @xmath34 and its variance is @xmath35    the remarkably simple result of eq .",
    "( [ exkpz ] ) shows that the expected cluster size converges to a finite value and it is the _ number _ of clusters that has to diverge in the @xmath36 limit .",
    "this can be also verified by the following direct evaluation .",
    "let us first calculate the probability that there are @xmath32 clusters in the system , i.e. that there are @xmath32 occupied sites in the mass picture . if the first site is to be occupied , place @xmath32 sites on a ring , label one of them @xmath37 and fill them with @xmath0 identical objects , such that every site gets at least one object , in @xmath38 ways .",
    "after that , place @xmath39 vacant sites in between the @xmath32 occupied sites in @xmath40 ways . on the other hand ,",
    "if the site @xmath37 is to be vacant , place @xmath41 sites on a ring , label one those @xmath37 and fill the sites @xmath42 , such that every site gets at least one object , in @xmath38 ways . then add @xmath43 vacant sites in between in @xmath44 ways .",
    "thus we get the hypergeometric distribution , @xmath45 which immediately yields @xmath46 from eqs .",
    "( [ exkpz ] ) and ( [ enckpz ] ) we find the intuitively expected relation @xmath47 .",
    "the knowledge of expectations of maximal objects is of great importance since it measures the size of large deviations in the system . in this section",
    "we study the statistics of the longest cluster , @xmath48 , in tasep .",
    "in particular , we discuss the finite size and limiting distribution functions , related expectations and the effects due to discreteness of the sample space of the mass variables .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( c.d.f . ) @xmath49 can be calculated as the ratio of the number of solutions to @xmath50 in non - negative integers with @xmath51 and the number of its solutions with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the first of these two numbers equals the coefficient of the @xmath54 order term in @xmath55 and therefore @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 stands for the integer part .",
    "note that for @xmath59 the distribution function takes the simple form @xmath60    the expectation calculated in terms of the c.d.f .  is @xmath61 so that , after simplifications , it can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 was defined in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) .",
    "it seems difficult to extract the limiting distribution and the type of the divergence of the mean from the exact results of eqs .",
    "( [ kpzcdf ] ) and ( [ asepemaxxact ] ) directly . for that purpose",
    ", we next consider an alternative approach based on independence .",
    "intuitively one would expect that as the system gets larger the weaker become the correlations between the clusters .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the mass variables are asymptotically independent , in that , for @xmath32 fixed , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . therefore , we can approximate the c.d.f",
    ".  @xmath68 by using the product measure , i.e. @xmath69 by writing @xmath70 we get in the large @xmath1 limit with @xmath71 fixed @xmath72 this result is , for @xmath32 sufficiently large , in agreement with the earlier result for the tail because eq .",
    "( [ kpzcdftail ] ) yields in the large system size limit @xmath73 which is simply the first order approximation for eq .",
    "( [ kpzcdflim ] ) .    the c.d.f .  in eq .",
    "( [ kpzcdflim ] ) can now be expressed in terms of a scaled variable @xmath74 from the asymptotic theory of the extremes for independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "variables we then obtain the gumbel , or fisher - tippett , distribution @xmath75 strictly speaking , however , the function on the right hand side is continuous , whereas the c.d.f .  on the left must be piecewise constant with an intrinsic thickness @xmath76 , so that the relation holds only when @xmath77 is an integer . in fact , eq .  ( [ kpzf - t ] ) would be the correct result for the _ continuous _ exponential parent distribution , whereas it has been shown by anderson @xcite that the _ discrete _ geometric distribution does not belong to the domain of attraction of the gumbel distribution at all , and that eq .",
    "( [ kpzf - t ] ) should indeed be replaced by @xmath78 i.e.  the limiting distribution function has gumbel envelopes .",
    "the expectation of a random variable with the gumbel distribution is known to equal euler s constant @xmath79 @xcite , but the evaluation of the expectation of a discrete variable with gumbel envelopes is not easily found in the literature . a direct calculation",
    "using the proper point probability function seems tedious and , therefore , we argue on heuristic grounds that since the piecewise constant c.d.f .  of the scaled variable @xmath80",
    "is confined between two envelope functions with expectations @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the final result should be written as @xmath83 where @xmath1 is large .",
    "[ figasep](a ) shows that the exact result eq .",
    "( [ asepemaxxact ] ) and the asymptotic formula eq .",
    "( [ asepemaxiid ] ) are in excellent agreement with the simulation data @xcite .",
    "the effect of discreteness of the mass variables can be seen even more clearly in the behavior of the variance than of the expectation .",
    "for continuous exponential variables , the variance of the maximum converges to a constant @xmath84 @xcite , where the scaling parameter @xmath85 equals @xmath86 in our case .",
    "the simulation results of fig .",
    "[ figasep](b ) display persistent fluctuations around this value , with the distance between the maxima diverging logarithmically in @xmath1 .",
    "this kind of behavior has recently been observed also by bazant @xcite in connection with percolation theory and the limiting distribution functions described by eqs .",
    "( [ limsup ] ) and ( [ liminf ] ) were called fisher - tippett limit cycles because of the quasiperiodic fluctuations of the variance .",
    "[ secasy ]    we now turn to the case @xmath7 .",
    "this means that every time we pick a particle at random , the rightmost particle in the cluster , where the chosen particle belongs to , makes a move . in the mass picture",
    "this translates to @xmath0 independent random walkers on a ring of @xmath12 sites @xcite .",
    "the joint stationary distribution for @xmath0 independent random walkers on a ring of @xmath12 sites is @xmath87 where @xmath8 is the number of walkers on the site @xmath15 . by eq .",
    "( [ pxkpz ] ) , the cluster length distribution for the tasep variables @xmath24 is now @xmath88 the limit of which is poisson with the proper normalization , @xmath89 the parameter @xmath90 introduced above describes the length scale of correlations in the system .",
    "remember that in the case @xmath6 the corresponding parameter was @xmath91 , so that the correlations are expected to die out faster in the present case .",
    "now we have the mean and the variance of the length of _ particle _ clusters @xmath92 @xmath93 since there are @xmath94 ways to choose @xmath32 sites from a ring of @xmath12 sites and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the stirling number of the second kind , ways to put @xmath0 particles into @xmath32 sites such that each site gets at least one particle , the distribution for the number of clusters now reads @xmath97 which again gives @xmath98 .    due to the lack of particle - hole symmetry , the properties of the _ hole",
    "_ clusters differ from those presented above .",
    "however , the distribution for the length @xmath99 of the @xmath10 hole cluster can be easily constructed in terms of the distribution for the mass variables , @xmath100 the corresponding c.d.f  is @xmath101 and the expected length of hole clusters @xmath102      the exact longest particle cluster c.d.f",
    ".  for the case @xmath22 reads @xmath103 which seems to be , from the viewpoint of applications , even less instructive than eq .",
    "( [ kpzcdf ] ) was for the ordinary tasep .",
    "however , an approximate form for the tail of the distribution can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ asycdfxact ] ) assuming that , for @xmath32 sufficiently large , at most one of the masses exceeds @xmath32 , @xmath104 here the sum in the last term is the probability that on a ring of @xmath105 sites with a total of @xmath106 independent random walkers there are at most @xmath32 walkers on a single site .",
    "but for @xmath107 , and approximately perhaps even for smaller @xmath32 values , this probability equals unity and therefore we have @xmath108 when @xmath32 is sufficiently large and also @xmath1 large at the last two stages .",
    "again , one can show that the cluster sizes are asymptotically independent , in that eq .",
    "( [ asymptoticiid ] ) holds with @xmath109 therefore , eq .  ( [ asycdftail ] ) suggests that the limiting distribution function is , as in the @xmath6 case , approximately given by the product @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath1 is large . from the mathematical point of view , however , one should be careful with this approximation , because the distribution function for the maximum of i.i.d .",
    "poisson variables does not actually converge to the gumbel distribution - not even in sense of continuous gumbel envelopes as it was in the @xmath6 case .",
    "namely , anderson has shown @xcite that the probability of the maximum concentrates on two consecutive integers , i.e.  there exists a sequence of integers @xmath112 such that @xmath113 the sequence @xmath114 then obviously determines the type of divergence of the mean .",
    "it was shown by kimber @xcite that in the leading order this sequence diverges as @xmath115 however , we would like to remark that , despite of its shortcomings , the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ asycdfcont ] ) yields the same functional form for the expected length of the longest cluster : in the leading order @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the indicator function and @xmath118 is some crossover mass , where the distribution function increases most rapidly . eq .",
    "( [ asycdfcont ] ) then gives the very interesting result @xmath119 i.e.  the expected length of the longest _ particle _ cluster diverges as the inverse relation of eq .",
    "( [ asyediv ] ) in @xmath0 . in the special case @xmath120 ,",
    "i.e.   @xmath121 , the type of divergence reduces to inverse factorial .",
    "furthermore , by stirling s formula one obtains the same functional form as in kimber s result in eq .",
    "( [ i_n ] ) .",
    "our analytical result is again supported by simulations as seen in fig .",
    "[ figasy](a ) .    the plot of the variance in fig .",
    "[ figasy](b ) shows again fluctuations , and the divergence of the distance between maxima is now dictated by the inverse relation of eq .",
    "( [ asyediv ] ) . in general",
    ", it can be seen that the fluctuations are more pronounced than those in the ordinary tasep .",
    "we also observe that the variance has a global maximum at a finite system size .",
    "below this maximum , the correlation length @xmath90 is comparable to the system size , which results in large fluctuations of the maximum . for @xmath122",
    "the system can be considered to consist of a large number of independent copies and the i.i.d .",
    "behavior is recovered . in the end",
    ", one should notice that , unfortunately , the continuum approximation of the form eq .",
    "( [ asycdfcont ] ) with the factorial replaced by the gamma function can not be used to evaluate the variance : in the continuous case , the maximum concentrates on one real number , in that the properly scaled variable converges to a distribution degenerate at zero .    in fig .",
    "[ figasy ] we show the expectation and the variance also for the _ hole _ clusters .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ holedistr ] ) , the limiting distribution for the lengths of the hole clusters is again geometric , as in the case of @xmath6 dynamics , but the number of clusters is random and the length of the longest cluster depends on that number .",
    "the solution to this problem can be found by defining new mass variables @xmath123 as the number of holes between @xmath10 and @xmath11 particle .",
    "( [ holecdf ] ) then tells that @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a sequence of constants with @xmath126 .",
    "since there are now @xmath0 new mass variables and the parent distribution is geometric - like , the limiting extremal distribution has again gumbel envelopes and the divergence of the mean is logarithmic , as seen in fig .  [",
    "figasy](a ) .",
    "we shall now discuss our results from a different point of view .",
    "there is a well - known mapping from tasep to a certain lattice model , namely the one - dimensional single - step model , of interface growth @xcite . in this mapping",
    "each particle is considered a unit step down and each vacancy a unit step up .",
    "the function @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the spatial and @xmath129 the time coordinate , obtained this way is defined to be constant between the integers and , say , right - continuous .",
    "clearly , the condition @xmath130 implies existence of a global tilt .",
    "the lengths of the clusters in the tasep picture translate to the lengths of the decreasing parts of the interface .",
    "note that the @xmath6 case has particle - hole symmetry and the results obtained for the decreasing parts ( corresponding to particle clusters ) are valid for the increasing parts ( hole clusters ) as well . for @xmath4 the properties of the increasing parts must be calculated from the hole distribution .",
    "the @xmath4 dynamics can be seen to be equivalent to deposition rule such that the deposited particles relax towards the local minima from the decreasing parts of the height function @xmath127 . if the particle lands on an increasing part , nothing happens . since",
    "this kind of asymmetry is not very common in real applications of the interface interpretation , we also studied numerically a spatial symmetrization of the @xmath22 case with @xmath121 .",
    "this symmetrization belongs to the edwards - wilkinson universality class @xcite . in it ,",
    "deposited particles always flow downhill to a local minimum . in case",
    "the particle lands on a hill top , the minimum is determined using a fair coin .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figsym ] .",
    "the mean length of the longest cluster diverges now faster than in the asymmetric @xmath22 case studied in sec .",
    "[ secasy ] , the earlier analytical result for which is shown for comparison in fig .",
    "[ figsym](a ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that on average the hole clusters are considerably shorter than in the case of asymmetric dynamics , which is compensated by longer particle clusters .",
    "the other features can be seen to be quite similar to those of the asymmetric case .",
    "for example , the variance of the longest cluster has a maximum at finite @xmath1 and quasiperiodic oscillations as before .    in conclusion",
    ", we presented analytical and numerical results for the properties of the clusters in asymmetric exclusion processes with two different dynamics .",
    "in particular , we studied the properties of the longest cluster in the system and showed that the large system behavior agrees with the asymptotic theory of the extremes for independent and identically distributed variables .",
    "the expected length of the longest cluster was found to diverge logarithmically with increasing system size for the ordinary tasep and as logarithm divided by double logarithm in the case of modified dynamics , which corresponds to independent random walkers in the mass picture . in the latter case ,",
