    "optical / uv and x - ray continua in quasars are thought to originate in two physically distinct , but nevertheless related regions .",
    "the optical / uv spectrum is dominated by a ` big blue bump ' continuum feature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most likely from thermal emission arising from an accretion disk @xcite . a hot gas lying above the disk in some unknown geometry then up - scatters these disk photons to form a hard power - law ( @xmath12 -1 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "while the shapes of the optical and x - ray continua are well known , the connecting continuum in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) is not , because of absorption from our own galaxy .",
    "the euv and soft x - rays form the ionizing continuum ( h@xmath13 13.6 ev ) needed to ionize a quasar s characteristic broad lines . the ionizing continuum is also responsible for any line - driven outflows from the accretion disk @xcite . since direct observation of this continuum is not possible , it is often parameterized by an imaginary power - law with spectral index @xmath0 running from 2500 @xmath3 to 2 kev in the rest frame .",
    "the importance of the ionizing continuum motivates the decades long study of the anti - correlation between @xmath0 and l@xmath14 @xcite ; however , controversy continues .",
    "while some studies have found that @xmath0 depends primarily on redshift rather than optical luminosity @xcite , others have suggested that @xmath0 may be entirely independent of redshift and optical luminosity @xcite , arguing that if the dispersion in l@xmath14 is much greater than the dispersion in l@xmath15 , an apparent but artificial correlation will result .",
    "a narrow range in optical luminosity will enhance this effect .    in recent years",
    ", studies of the @xmath16 relation have become more comprehensive , with higher x - ray detection rates and largely complete samples that span a wide range of luminosities @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite work spans five and four decades in uv and x - ray luminosity , respectively , which helps minimize the effect of an artificial @xmath16 correlation due to selection effects .",
    "in addition , @xcite estimated the dispersion in l@xmath14 and l@xmath15 , finding that the difference in dispersions was not enough to artificially reproduce a correlation .",
    "these studies used partial correlation analysis to conclude that the @xmath17z correlation is insignificant , while the @xmath16 anti - correlation is highly significant .",
    "however , while the significance of the relation continues to be better understood , little is known of the underlying physics . current disk - corona models @xcite do not directly predict the @xmath16 relation .",
    "previous studies of the @xmath16 relation have largely lacked spectral slopes in the x - rays , and so used the traditional endpoints of 2500  @xmath3 and 2 kev , where an x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath18 2 , where @xmath7 = -@xmath19 + 1 for f@xmath20 ) is assumed in order to obtain the x - ray flux at 2 kev . a systematic study with both optical and x - ray spectra enables an investigation of the relation at different frequencies than those traditionally used , revealing clues about the relation s physical underpinnings .    the sample selection and measurement of @xmath0",
    "are described in  2 , and results of the data analysis are given in  3 .",
    "section 4 discusses the results , specifically their connection to other optical / x - ray relations found for quasars .",
    "we assume a standard cosmology throughout the paper , where h@xmath21 = 70 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we have cross - correlated the dr5 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with _ xmm - newton _ archival observations to obtain 792 x - ray observations of sdss quasars .",
    "this gives the largest sample of optically selected quasars with both optical and x - ray spectra ( 473 quasars with x - ray s / n @xmath2 6 ) .",
    "@xcite describes the sdss quasar selection and cross - correlation with the _ xmm - newton _ archive , as well as the x - ray data reduction and spectral fitting . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we exclude broad absorption line ( bal ) and radio - loud ( rl ) quasars , as these are known to have different @xmath0 distributions than typical , radio - quiet ( rq ) quasars @xcite .",
    "while @xcite used an incomplete bal list @xcite , this paper updates the bal classification using the dr5 bal catalog @xcite .",
    "a total of 18 sources are re - classified as bals , and an additional 15 sources are re - classified as non - bals .",
    "a net result of three additional bals , gives the sdss / xmm - newton quasar survey 55 bals in total .",
    "since the goal is to use our knowledge of the x - ray spectrum to determine the effects of the x - ray continuum shape on the calculation of @xmath0 , we form a sample of quasars with enough x - ray s / n to fit a spectrum ( s / n @xmath2 6 ) in the primary sample of this study , hereafter referred to as spectra . as in @xcite , we fit three models to each spectrum : 1 ) a single power - law ( spl ) with no intrinsic absorption , 2 ) a fixed power - law ( fpl ) with intrinsic absorption left free to vary , and 3 ) an intrinsically absorbed power - law ( apl ) , with both photon index @xmath7 and absorption n@xmath25 left free to vary .",
    "any spectrum that does not give a good fit with any of the above models is excluded from the sample , in order to ensure well - determined x - ray fluxes .",
    "therefore the final sample will not include any sources with , for example , a significant contribution from a strong soft excess component .",
    "in addition , any spectrum that prefers either of the absorbed models ( fpl or apl ) is excluded from the sample , in order to minimize the effect of absorption on both x - ray and optical flux measurements .",
    "this reduces the sample by 55 sources , or 11.6% of quasars with x - ray s / n @xmath2 6 .",
    "once all of the selections are taken into account , the sample contains 327 quasars spanning a redshift range of z = 0.1 - 4.4 .",
    "the median upper - limit for intrinsic absorption in the spectra sample is n@xmath26 4 x 10@xmath27 @xmath28 . to check for the effect of undetected absorption in low s / n x - ray spectra",
    ", we raise the threshold to s / n @xmath2 20 , where n@xmath25 upper limits decrease to @xmath5 6 x @xmath29 @xmath28 .",
    "this sample contains 99 sources and will hereafter be referred to as highsnr .",
    "finally , we avoid bias against x - ray weak sources by adding undetected or low - signal sources to the spectra sample , to create the censored sample . to include sources with s / n @xmath30 6 , we apply a fixed power - law fit with no absorption , where the power - law is fixed to @xmath7 = 1.9 , the average value for the sdss / xmm - newton quasar survey @xcite .",
    "rl and bal quasars are still excluded , as are any sources with bad x - ray fits , leaving 514 sources in the sample spanning a redshift range of z = 0.1 - 5.0 .",
    "the three samples used in this paper are described in table 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : imagvsz ] gives the @xmath31 band magnitude vs. redshift distribution of each of the three samples .",
    "for each spectra sample source , we fit six versions of an unabsorbed power - law .",
    "the normalization is frozen to rest - frame energy values of 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 7 and 10 kev and then the monochromatic fluxes are taken at each energy .",
    "freezing the normalization at each energy enables us to accurately calculate the error on the flux based on the error on the normalization of the fit .",
    "if the normalization was frozen to 1 kev observed - frame , as is standard , both the error in normalization and the error on @xmath7 would affect the error on the flux . for 215 quasars ,",
    "at least one of the rest - frame energies lies below the observed range . in these cases , we normalize the spectrum to 1 kev and extrapolate to obtain the flux at the rest - frame energy .",
    "we do not normalize to rest - frame energies lower than 1 kev because undetected absorption with a median upper limit of n@xmath32 5 x 10@xmath27 would eliminate any measured flux at 0.5 kev , and would reduce the flux measured at 0.75 kev by an order of magnitude . at 1 kev ,",
    "the change in flux is only a factor of @xmath52 , which would change @xmath0 by @xmath50.1 .",
    "limiting the normalization energies to 1 kev and higher has the added benefit of minimizing the contribution from any soft excess component .",
    "we also do not attempt to fit fluxes at rest - frame energies higher than 10 kev , as these are only directly available for high redshift ( and therefore high luminosity ) sources .",
    "extrapolation with the fitted power - law for low redshift sources would not take into account the reflection bump that begins rising at 10 kev and peaks near 30 - 50 kev . for low redshift sources ,",
    "rest - frame energies of 7 - 10 kev will sample the 7 - 10 kev observed spectrum , where under- or over - subtraction of the background can alter the measured fluxes .",
    "the resulting increase in flux measurement error will affect the dispersion of the @xmath33 relation , which will be discussed further in  3 .    before calculating optical luminosities , we first correct the magnitudes for galactic reddening .",
    "corrections are applied using a galactic dust - to - gas ratio and the galactic hydrogen column density from webpimms , which is based on the 21 cm hi compilation of dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and kalberla et al .",
    "we then interpolate a power - law through the well - calibrated sdss photometry ( @xmath52 - 3% photometric error ) .",
    "as detailed below , we carefully select wavebands for interpolation to avoid host galaxy contribution at low redshift , the ly@xmath19 forest at high redshift , and major emission lines .    for redshifts z @xmath30 0.55",
    ", the host galaxy can redden the magnitudes at long wavelengths , so we use the bluest bands , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , to determine the optical slope , while also avoiding those bands containing the mgii line . for z @xmath30 0.25",
    ", we use the @xmath35 and @xmath36 , switching to @xmath34 and @xmath35 for 0.25 @xmath30 z @xmath30 0.43 , and then to @xmath34 and @xmath36 for 0.43 @xmath30 z @xmath30 0.55 .",
    "( note that the mgii line lies largely between the @xmath34 and @xmath35 filters for the middle redshift range , 0.25 @xmath30 z @xmath30 0.43 . )    for quasars at redshifts above z = 0.55 , we assume host galaxy contribution to be minimal @xcite and fit a power - law through all wavebands using an ordinary least - squares regression .",
    "while lines such as mgii , ciii and civ affect the photometry at various redshifts , their addition to the continuum flux is minimized by the broad bandwidths ( the @xmath35,@xmath36,@xmath31 and @xmath37 bands have fwhm @xmath5 1000 @xmath3 ) .",
    "in addition , the regression fit to all wavebands minimizes the contribution of any one waveband that is an outlier due to line emission .",
    "as the ly@xmath19 line begins to affect the wavebands , they are removed from the regression fit .",
    "the @xmath34 band is removed from the fit at z = 1.8 , and the @xmath35 band at z = 2.3 . at z @xmath2 3.75 , for two quasars",
    ", the ly@xmath19 line affects the spectrum significantly and we simply fix the optical slope to the median value from @xcite , @xmath38 = 0.46 .    the normalization of the optical power - law is also adjusted according to redshift . for sources with z @xmath30 0.55 ,",
    "the power - law is normalized at the bluest band to avoid host galaxy contamination . for sources with 0.55 @xmath30 z @xmath30 3.75 , the power - law is normalized using the ordinary least squares fit to all of the available magnitudes . for the single source with z @xmath2 3.75 ,",
    "the power - law is normalized to the @xmath37 band to minimize the effect of the ly@xmath19 forest . from the measurement of the index and normalization of the optical power - law",
    ", we can extrapolate to three monochromatic optical luminosities at 1500 , 2500 and 5000 @xmath3 , where the log of the optical luminosity is hereafter denoted as @xmath1 .    the blend of feii and balmer emission lines that make up the small blue bump @xcite affects monochromatic optical fluxes by 0 - 45% @xcite .",
    "this causes at most a small overestimate of @xmath0 by @xmath39(@xmath0 ) @xmath5 0.06 .",
    "the mean optical slope obtained for the sdss / xmm - newton quasar survey ( @xmath38 = -0.40 ) is similar to the slope of the @xcite mean composite ( @xmath38 = -0.44 ) , indicating that the host galaxy and emission line contributions have been adequately taken into account .",
    "the dispersion of the optical slope is @xmath40 = 0.30 , similar to the dispersion seen in the composites of @xcite , where @xmath40 @xmath5 0.26 .",
    "once the optical luminosities are obtained , corrections for dust - reddening are applied where necessary .",
    "we obtain an estimate of e(b - v ) from the relative ( @xmath41 ) color , where relative colors compare a quasar s measured colors with the median colors in its redshift bin , so that @xmath39(@xmath41 ) = ( @xmath41 )  -  @xmath30(@xmath42)@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "quasars with @xmath39(@xmath41 ) @xmath30 0.2 lie within the normal color distribution for sdss quasars , and so are not likely to be affected by dust - reddening . for quasars with @xmath39(@xmath41 ) @xmath2 0.2 the e(b - v ) estimated from the relative colors is used to de - redden the optical luminosities with an smc - type extinction curve @xcite .",
    "note that the correction can only be made for sources with redshift less than 2.2 for the relative colors to be valid , due to the entry of the ly@xmath19 line into the spectrum .",
    "sources with e(b - v ) @xmath2 0.04 are classified as dust - reddened and make up 7.6% of the sdss / xmm - newton quasar survey .",
    "this fraction is comparable to that found for sdss quasars ( 6% , * ? ? ?",
    "we next calculate @xmath0 with the standard formula : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the monochromatic flux at 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 7 , or 10 kev and @xmath46 is the monochromatic flux at 1500 , 2500 , or 5000 @xmath3 .",
    "for each @xmath6 relation , we fit an ordinary least - squares regression line and obtain the slope and intercept .",
    "the errors are at the 1@xmath47 level , and the standard deviation on the regression gives the observed scatter in the relation .",
    "for the censored sample , we fix the power - law to the sample average of @xmath7 = 1.9 for 187 sources with s / n @xmath30 6 , and then fit the monochromatic x - ray flux . for 59 undetected sources with s / n @xmath30 2 , we fit the 90% upper - limit on the flux . since the data now include upper limits , we input the lists of @xmath0 and @xmath1 into the ` estimate and maximize ' ( em ) function to compute the linear regression .",
    "this method is among several routines available on asurv rev 1.2 , a survival statistics package @xcite , which implements the methods presented in @xcite .",
    "survival statistics account for censored data by assuming that the upper limits follow the same distribution as the detected points .",
    "the em regression reduces to an ordinary least squares fit for uncensored data .",
    "for all three samples , we use a partial correlation test designed to measure the correlation between two variables , while controlling for the effects of a third . the fortran program",
    "cens_tau calculates kendall s @xmath48 partial correlation coefficient , and can take censored data into account using the methodology presented in @xcite . unless otherwise noted , redshift is the third variable for the correlation tests .",
    "both asurv and cens_tau are made available by the penn state center for astrostatistics .",
    "we first measure the @xmath6 anti - correlation using the analysis of previous studies @xcite on the censored sample . in comparison to @xcite ,",
    "the censored sample is larger ( n=514 , compared to n=333 ) , with a similar range of @xmath54 decades in x - ray luminosity .",
    "the x - ray upper limit fraction is similar as well , ( 11% , compared to 12% for @xcite ) .",
    "the range in optical luminosity in @xcite is roughly 1.5 decades larger than the range in this paper ( 3.5 decades ) , due largely to their inclusion of low and moderate - luminosity samples in addition to the sdss .",
    "figure [ fig : aoxvslopt_old ] shows the @xmath6 anti - correlation , significant at the 9.0@xmath47 level ( @xmath48 = -0.20 ) in the _ sdss / xmm _ quasar survey when defined at the conventional 2500 @xmath3 and 2 kev fiducial points . the solid line is the best - fit em regression line for the censored sample : @xmath49 the slope is consistent within errors to the best - fit regression from @xcite ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : aoxvslopt_old ] ) . unlike in @xcite , we are not able to reject a correlation between @xmath0 and redshift while controlling for @xmath50",
    ". instead we find the partial correlation to be marginally significant at the 3.8@xmath47 level ( @xmath48 = -0.085 ) in the censored sample .",
    "this is likely due to the smaller range in optical luminosity , as well as the large scatter in @xmath0 .",
    "note that in the spectra sample , the partial correlation between @xmath0 and redshift is largely insignificant , except at 1 kev where , again , the scatter is significant ( see table [ tab : aoxz ] ) .",
    "we can now test the correlations of @xmath0 versus optical luminosity using the spectra sample , for each of the six x - ray energies and three optical wavelengths where @xmath0 is defined .",
    "figure 3 shows 6 examples of the relation , defined at 1500 , 2500 and 5000 @xmath3 and at 1 and 10 kev .",
    "the plots show a trend in the slope and dispersion of @xmath6 relation : the slope flattens and the dispersion tightens as the x - ray energy used to define @xmath0 increases .",
    "it is clear from the plots that the effect of changing x - ray energy is much stronger than that of changing optical wavelength .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 depends on the baseline over which it is defined ; lengthening the baseline can produce an artificial flattening of the @xmath6 slope . to check that the intrinsic slope of the correlation is changing ,",
    "we define the standard slope by the relation at 2500 @xmath3 and 2 kev .",
    "we then calculate how the change in baseline affects the slope and intercept of the relation . as the changing baseline frequencies are accompanied by a change in the x - ray flux",
    ", we include this effect by assuming an average value for the x - ray slope ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the equations for the change in slope ( m ) and intercept ( b ) then become : @xmath52 and @xmath53\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the x - ray frequency at 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 7 , or 10 kev and @xmath55 is the optical frequency at 1500 , 2500 , or 5000 @xmath3 . a change in the optical baseline , for example from 2500 to 5000 @xmath3 ,",
    "affects the slope of the @xmath6 relation by an amount comparable to the error .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite , who find a marginal strengthening of the @xmath4 relation as the optical reference point is moved to shorter wavelengths .",
    "this may be due to a steepening of the correlation slope , but the small sample size and the strong effect of reddening on the sample do not allow a definitive statement . since the slope does not depend significantly on optical wavelength in our results , we plot our results only for 2500 @xmath3 in figure 4 , in order to focus on the change with x - ray energy .",
    "figure 4@xmath56 shows that while changing the x - ray baseline clearly has an influence on the measured slopes , the slope for 1 kev is significantly steeper than it would be if the intrinsic correlation were constant .",
    "the slopes at 4 , 7 and 10 kev are flatter than predicted by the baseline effect at the 1@xmath47 level . however , since the baseline effect is arbitrarily normalized to the slope at 2 kev , the main result of subtracting the baseline effect is not to assess the significance of the slope at a given energy , but rather to show that the @xmath57 slope of the @xmath6 relation is flattening as x - ray energy increases .",
    "figure 4@xmath58 and 4@xmath59 show the intercept and dispersion of each relation as measured via the least squares fit .",
    "the intercept of the relation decreases significantly with x - ray energy compared to the predicted curve .",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath6 relation largely follows the predicted curve , though it is larger than predicted at the lowest and highest energies .",
    "this is likely due to the larger errors in x - ray flux at the ends of the spectrum .    for low redshift sources , rest - frame energies of 7 - 10 kev will sample the 7 - 10 kev observed spectrum , where under- or over - subtraction of the background can alter the measured fluxes and increase the error in the flux measurement .",
    "when we exclude sources with z @xmath30 0.5 , we find that the dispersion of the @xmath6 relation at 7 and 10 kev decreases by @xmath5 0.005 , though the dispersions do not decrease all the way to the baseline level .",
    "this suggests that the background does have some effect at low redshifts , but it is not the only source of scatter at high energies .",
    "interestingly , the trend in slope and dispersion of the @xmath6 relation for the censored sample is mostly consistent with the baseline effect ( fig . [",
    "fig : censored ] ) , with a significantly steeper slope than expected at 1 kev .",
    "the slopes also show the same marginal flattening at high x - ray energies as the spectra sample .",
    "these results are not as strong as in the spectra sample .",
    "figure [ fig : aoxvslopt_old ] suggests that the main effect of including low s / n and undetected sources is an increase in scatter , diluting any potential trends .",
    "the red circles in the figure , representing detected sources with no spectral fit , show a weaker anti - correlation , while the blue circles , representing sources with spectral fits , are more strongly anti - correlated .",
    "a partial correlation test shows that the correlation decreases in significance from 8.6@xmath47 ( @xmath48 = -0.284 ) for sources with s / n @xmath2 6 to 4.6@xmath47 ( @xmath48",
    "= -0.131 ) for sources with s / n @xmath30 6 .    a higher percentage of s / n @xmath30 6 sources are x - ray weak ( @xmath0 @xmath30 -1.8 ) : 18.7% , compared to only 3.7% in the spectra ( s / n @xmath2 6 ) sample , where absorbed sources have been excluded . since absorption can not be accounted for in the low s / n sources , it is a likely source of the scatter .",
    "figure [ fig : snrvsdelgi ] confirms that though the spectra sample does not remove every x - ray weak source , those with the heaviest optical obscuration ( @xmath39(@xmath41 ) @xmath60 0.3 ) are excluded from the sample .",
    "this illustrates the importance of x - ray spectra in excluding absorbed sources .    for the highsnr sample ,",
    "the slopes show the same trend as found in the spectra sample ( cf .",
    "figures 4@xmath56 and 6@xmath56 ) , though the errors are larger due to the smaller sample size .",
    "therefore the significant change in slope of the @xmath6 relation is not likely to be due to the effect of undetected absorption in the sources with low s / n x - ray spectra .",
    "however , the scatter in the relation defined at low energies does decrease for the highsnr sample ( cf . figures 4@xmath59 and 6@xmath58 ) , suggesting that undetected absorption affects the dispersion of the @xmath6 relation when sources with low s / n spectra are included .",
    "results for the censored , spectra and highsnr samples are summarized in table [ tab : results ] , which gives the slope , intercept and dispersion for the @xmath6 relation at each x - ray energy for each sample .",
    "the spectra sample will be used for the following discussion .      to gain increased understanding of the trends found above , we tested for correlations with physical parameters .",
    "controlling for the effects of the optical luminosity , we computed the partial correlation coefficient between @xmath0 and black hole mass , eddington ratio , and redshift .",
    "black hole masses were derived in @xcite using the width and continuum luminosities of broad emission lines in the optical spectrum : h@xmath61 for 0 @xmath30 z @xmath30 0.7 , mgii for 0.7 @xmath30 1.9 , and civ for 1.9 @xmath30 z @xmath30 4.5 .",

    "the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray slope has been shown to steepen at higher l@xmath8/l@xmath9 or at larger fwhm(h@xmath61 ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite broke this degeneracy by analyzing a sample of 35 quasars over three orders of magnitude in luminosity , finding a stronger @xmath69l@xmath8/l@xmath9 than @xmath69fwhm(h@xmath61 ) .",
    "a linear fit to the sdss / xmm - newton data @xcite gives : @xmath77    to illustrate the discussion below , a notional sed is shown in figure [ fig : fakesed ] .",
    "the figure shows a simple model of a quasar sed , where specific luminosities are measured at 2500 @xmath3 and 1 kev . since the @xmath10 relation is not significant at 1 kev , using the luminosity at this energy ( instead of at 10 kev , as above ) allows the focus to be on the effect of the dispersion associated with the @xmath69l@xmath8/l@xmath9 relation . in the figure ,",
    "model ( a ) illustrates a source with lower @xmath1 ( 10@xmath78 ergs s@xmath22 ) and model ( b ) shows a source with higher @xmath1 ( 10@xmath79 ergs s@xmath22 ) . inserting the optical luminosity into the appropriate @xmath6 relations gives an average value for @xmath0 ( dashed lines ) and therefore for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "since 1 kev is near the pivot point of the x - ray spectrum @xcite , the average x - ray slope will not depend on @xmath80 , and so will just be the mean @xmath7 of the sample ( @xmath82 1.9 ) .",
    "the dispersion around the mean will arise from two sources : 1 ) dispersion associated with the @xmath76l@xmath8/l@xmath9 relation ( eqn [ eqn : gammaledd ] , shown in figure [ fig : fakesed ] ) and 2 ) dispersion in l@xmath8/l@xmath9 for a given @xmath1 . while the flattening of the @xmath6 relation with energy implies harder x - ray slope as optical luminosity increases , fig .",
    "[ fig : fakesed ] shows that this expected hardening is small compared to the dispersion around the mean .",
    "therefore , any secondary relation between @xmath11 would have too large a dispersion for the correlation to be significant .",
    "moreover , figure [ fig : fakesed ] shows how the @xmath10 relation results naturally as a secondary correlation with large scatter .",
    "the figure shows that sources at a given l@xmath83 with higher hard x - ray luminosities will have harder x - ray slopes , while those with higher soft x - ray luminosities will have softer slopes .",
    "the combination of the @xmath6 relation with the @xmath7-l@xmath8/l@xmath9 relation thus returns the @xmath10 relations for x - ray energies @xmath84 1 kev or @xmath85 1 kev .      as @xmath0 can be used to apply a bolometric correction to the hard x - rays ( 2 - 10 kev ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by providing a normalization for the x - ray spectrum , we plot in figure [ fig : kbol ] the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath0 .",
    "since l@xmath8 is tightly related to the optical luminosity through the bolometric correction , and l@xmath15 is tightly related to l@xmath87 through integration over @xmath7 , the linear correlation is expected . however , both the correlation and its dispersion , @xmath47 = 0.12 , are of interest when determining x - ray bolometric corrections . for reference ,",
    "the best - fit line is : @xmath88    the x - ray weak quasars with very large bolometric corrections ( @xmath86 @xmath2 1000 ) do not have enough s / n for x - ray spectral fits .",
    "one object is optically red ( @xmath39(@xmath89 ) = 0.33 ) , so it is possible that these extreme objects are suffering from absorption , affecting both their @xmath0 and @xmath86 values .",
    "an additional factor to consider is accretion rate .",
    "we find a significant partial correlation between @xmath86 and l@xmath8/l@xmath9 .",
    "the presence of l@xmath8 on both axes can result in a false correlation , but a partial correlation test with l@xmath8 as the third variable shows that the correlation is significant at the 7.7@xmath47 level , with a @xmath48 = 0.232 .",
    "the correlation is plotted in figure [ fig : kboledd ] with a best fit line : @xmath90 this correlation is consistent with previous results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and suggests that the fraction of disk photons up - scattered to the x - rays decreases as accretion rate increases .",
    "we find that the slope of the @xmath6 relation depends on the x - ray energy at which @xmath0 is defined , though there is no significant dependence on optical wavelength . while a change in slope is predicted when the baseline over which @xmath0 is defined increases or decreases , the slopes at the lowest x - ray energy are significantly steeper than predicted , while the slopes at high x - ray energies are marginally flatter than predicted .",
    "this suggests that the efficiency of low energy x - ray photon production depends more strongly on the optical / uv photon supply , whereas the efficiency of high energy x - ray photon production remains relatively constant with respect to the seed photon supply .",
    "partial correlation tests show that eddington ratio is highly correlated with @xmath0 when controlling for @xmath1 , and this partial correlation increases in significance with x - ray energy , suggesting that accretion rate likely plays a role in the results .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath1 remains the primary driver of @xmath0 .    to check the results ,",
    "we redo the calculations for a sample including low s / n sources ( censored ) and for a sample including only high s / n sources ( highsnr ) .",
    "the censored sample shows the same trends as in the spectra sample , though the results are less significant .",
    "this is likely due to the diluting effect of absorption in the low s / n sources , which emphasizes the importance of x - ray spectra in eliminating sources with absorption .",
    "the highsnr sample reproduces the trend in the slope of the @xmath6 relation found for the spectra sample , indicating that the results are not affected by undetected absorption .",
    "the dispersion of the relation does decrease significantly for the highsnr sample , suggesting that undetected absorption does introduce some error into the determination of x - ray fluxes for sources with moderate s / n .    by combining the @xmath6 relation with the @xmath7-l@xmath8/l@xmath9 relation , we can naturally explain two results : 1 ) the existence of the @xmath10 relation as reported in @xcite and 2 ) the lack of a @xmath11 relation .",
    "given the measured dispersions and correlation coefficients , it is likely that the @xmath6 and @xmath7- l@xmath8/l@xmath9 relations are the primary relations , while the @xmath10 relation is secondary .",
    "understanding the relations in this order will give a more complete framework for understanding the relation between optical and x - ray emission in quasars . in order to fully understand the physical implications of the results shown here ,",
    "a study of the selection , orientation and variability effects is needed .",
    "such a study is now in progress .    finally , for the purposes of aiding studies of the hard x - ray bolometric correction",
    ", we include a description of the @xmath86 - @xmath0 correlation and dispersion .",
    "we find a significant partial correlation between @xmath86 and l@xmath8/l@xmath9 , when taking bolometric luminosity into account as the third variable .",
    "this is consistent with a decreasing fraction of up - scattered x - ray photons as accretion rate increases .",

    "<S> , we create a sample of 327 quasars with x - ray s / n @xmath2 6 , where both optical and x - ray spectra are available . </S>",
    "<S> this allows @xmath0 to be defined at arbitrary frequencies , rather than the standard 2500 @xmath3 and 2 kev . </S>",
    "<S> we find that while the choice of optical wavelength does not strongly influence the @xmath4 relation , the slope of the relation does depend on the choice of x - ray energy . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the relation becomes steeper when @xmath0 is defined at low ( @xmath5 1 kev ) x - ray energies . </S>",
    "<S> this change is significant when compared to the slope predicted by a decrease in the baseline over which @xmath0 is defined . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes are also marginally flatter than predicted at high ( @xmath5 10 kev ) x - ray energies . </S>",
    "<S> partial correlation tests show that while the primary driver of @xmath0 is @xmath1 , the eddington ratio correlates strongly with @xmath0 when @xmath1 is taken into account , so accretion rate may help explain these results . </S>",
    "<S> we combine the @xmath6 and @xmath7-l@xmath8/l@xmath9 relations to naturally explain two results : 1 ) the existence of the @xmath10 relation as reported in @xcite and 2 ) the lack of a @xmath11 relation . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of the optical / x - ray correlations establishes a more complete framework for understanding the relation between quasar emission mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss two correlations with the hard x - ray bolometric correction , which we show correlates with both @xmath0 and eddington ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that an increase in accretion rate correlates with a decrease in the fraction of up - scattered disk photons . </S>"
