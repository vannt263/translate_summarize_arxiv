    "data from atmospheric  @xcite , solar  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and long - baseline accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments can be accommodated by two approximate 2-neutrino mixing schemes , each parameterised by a mass - squared splitting and a mixing angle .",
    "the goal of the future experimental program in neutrino oscillations is to determine how these ` solar ' and ` atmospheric ' sectors combine into an overall 3-neutrino mixing scheme .",
    "this requires a search for sub - dominant appearance events ; a signal whose strength is controlled by a third angle , 13 , that is currently only bounded from above .",
    "up to three physical phases can be incorporated into a 3-neutrino mixing scheme ; however , only the effect of the dirac phase , , can be seen in an oscillation experiment as cp - violation .",

    "@xcite will be the first to probe @xmath12 below the current limit and possibly confirm the reported hint for @xmath14",
    ". if @xmath12 is beyond the reach of near future experiments , intense sources of neutrinos will be necessary : next generation superbeams  @xcite , neutrino factories  @xcite and beta beams  @xcite .",
    "the aspiration of future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is to determine the third mixing angle , @xmath12 , whether there is cp - violation in the lepton sector ; and to determine the sign of @xmath15 .",
    "this is not straightforward ; the analysis of the appearance channels is capable of returning up to 8 equally allowable fits to the data  @xcite .",
    "the challenge is therefore successful resolution of these degeneracies and a simultaneous push for the best sensitivity .",
    "a beta beam is a source of intense and collimated beams of electron neutrinos or anti - neutrinos originating from the decay of boosted radioactive ions .",
    "the proposal is an integrated facility combining individual production , acceleration and storage components .",
    "ion production could make use of the isotope separation online ( isol ) technique  @xcite within the eurisol at cern ; production rings  @xcite to minimise losses of parent nuclides in a beam dump ; or a two target system using an intense beam of deuterons  @xcite .",
    "the acceleration would make use of existing or potential upgrades to current facilities such as the cern accelerator chain , the fermilab main injector and tevatron ; and maybe desy",
    ". a storage ring whose straight sections point towards the far detectors will be the main infrastructure addition required .",
    "it is advantageous to produce a clean , collimated beam by this technique since a single boost is all that is necessary for a laboratory neutrino flux to span an energy range up to several gev .",
    "however , one is not free to choose the laboratory neutrino spectrum ; the boost determines the maximum neutrino in the laboratory frame which in turn determines the un - oscillated event rate at all energies .",
    "one way to alleviate this problem is to use a source of mono - energetic neutrinos so that the boost of the ion can be altered to freely choose the laboratory frame energy of the neutrinos .",
    "clearly , such an approach needs at least two boosts as both @xmath12 and @xmath1 are unknown .",
    "the use of electron capture decays to source mono - energetic neutrino fluxes has taken on two guises .",
    "the first paper  @xcite ( and a subsequent study  @xcite ) proposed the use of ions with q - values less than twice the electron mass , hence positron decay is kinematically forbidden .",
    "these are not realistic , however , since the ion half - lives are too long and the boosts required can only be achieved with the lhc .",
    "the idea of using electron capture decays was in fact first suggested at the eurisol meeting in january 2005  @xcite with focus on higher q - valued ions .",
    "this was later expanded into studies for the cern - frejus and cern - canfranc baselines  @xcite . for ions with q - value greater than twice the electron mass , the electron capture channel competes with a positron decay ` background ' ; the branching ratio for electron capture channels drops sharply as the q - value increases . with q - values",
    "@xmath16 3 - 4 mev and a 1 tev accelerator , one would be able to place a mono - energetic neutrino beam on first oscillation maximum for baselines up to 1000 km , making the idea an attractive one in europe with the source based at cern .",
    "however , the positron decay background would make the idea unattractive since the number of useful electron capture decays would not be high enough for a competitive physics reach .",
    "it could be argued that the positron decay neutrinos could be used to boost sensitivity by providing coverage of the second oscillation maxima with concentration of the electron capture neutrinos on or around first oscillation maximum .",
    "this is the hybrid beta beam strategy explored in detail in  @xcite .",
    "a number of nuclides that decay quickly through large gamow - teller resonances have been discovered in the gd region of the segre chart , see for example  @xcite , that opens the possibility of a higher q - value electron capture beam .",
    "these ions source dominant electron capture channels at higher q - values .",
    "one of these ions ( @xmath0dy ) forms the basis of this paper as it did  @xcite where it was used to source the cern - frejus and cern - canfranc baselines with a large water cerenkov as the far detector .    in this article , the work of bernabeu and espinoza  @xcite is extended to include the effect of the choice of lorentz boost pairing , the relative run times at each boost , the number of useful ion decays , and the number of atmospheric neutrino events . in sec .",

    "lower q - values require higher @xmath28 to achieve the same laboratory neutrino energies , and so lower q - values are favoured in this sense , provided the accelerator is capable of achieving the boosts .",
    "the discovery of ions far from the stability line that decay through a giant gamow - teller resonance opened up the possibility of using 1 tev machines such as an upgraded super proton synchrotron ( sps )  @xcite ( envisaged in some lhc - upgrade scenarios ) , to source the intermediate baselines in europe . as mentioned previously ,",
    "@xcite considered this probability for the cern - frejus ( 130 km ) and cern - canfranc ( 650 km ) baselines with @xmath0dy as the chosen ion . since",
    "only a neutrino flux is available in an electron capture setup , the approach was to exploit the different energy dependence of the cp - odd and cp - even properties of the appearance probability ( eq .",
    "3.2 ) by running at two different boosts .",
    "the purpose of those studies was not to identify lorentz boosts of particular interest , rather to demonstrate the phenomenological feasibility of the idea : the use of multiple boosts to extract the energy dependence of the event spectra .",
    "the goal of this article is to examine the cp - violation reach as a function of the boosts , number of useful decays and atmospheric event rate .    for electron",
    "capture and beta beam setups , the parent ions will be accelerated in the existing or upgraded cern infrastructure before accumulated and stored in a ring whose long , straight sections source the neutrino flux . for electron",
    "capture machines with ion boost @xmath28 , the mono - energetic neutrino flux at a detector distance l from the source is given by eq .",
    "[ e : flux ] .",
    "since the neutrino energy in the laboratory frame is given by @xmath30 , for fixed baseline and number of useful decays , the ions with lower q - values result in larger fluxes ( because of the larger boost needed to achieve a given energy ) .",
    "the choice of ion is thus a balance between q - value and the available acceleration . from the ions presented in tab .",
    "i , @xmath31dy and @xmath32er have very similar characteristics ; the bulk of all decays being an electron capture , half - lives @xmath16 3 minutes and neutrino energies of @xmath16 2 mev in the rest frame .",
    "the lower q - value ion , @xmath0dy , will be taken in this paper for consistency with  @xcite and the higher @xmath28 s required compensate for the lower electron capture branching ratio .",
    "the remaining 36  % for @xmath0dy is @xmath24-decay and so does not source a primary neutrino background ; the daughter has 100  % @xmath24-decay with a 74 year half - life .",
    "the other ions in tab .",

    "these higher q - value ions also have a large positron decay background and are more suitable for the hybrid machine introduced in [ 35 ] . for a @xmath0dy ion , the maximum boost attainable with an upgraded 1  tev sps  @xcite is @xmath33 = 440dy ion is in fact @xmath34",
    "; however , it is necessary to leave several electrons bound to the nucleus to source the electron capture decay .",
    "if one leaves the 2 k - shell electrons and 2 in the l - shell , this reduces the maximum boost to 440 ] corresponding to a laboratory frame energy of @xmath35 = 1.23 gev . for a electron capture machine with no backgrounds the choice of detector does not depend on the energy reconstruction capabilities as the event energy is determined by the boost . in reality",
    ", some reconstruction might be necessary for the appearence events to reduce the atmospheric background , especially if low production rates or issues with the acceleration force a large duty cycle .",
    "this point will be discussed further in sec .",
    "[ s : bck ] .",
    "since the maximum laboratory frame energy is 1.23 gev , baselines in excess of cern - canfranc are unrealistic propositions",
    ". therefore matter effects are small , but not negligible , and are not enough to achieve competitive sensitivities to the mass hierarchy .",
    "electron capture machines of this type are therefore ` cp - violation machines '",
    ".    although an electron capture machine is a variant on a beta beam , there are number of further technological challenges that need to be overcome for such a facility to be realised ;    1 .",
    "candidate ions have large proton numbers which bring problems with space charge in the early part of the accelerator chain .",
    "2 .   electrons need to be left on the ions for the electron capture channel to be available .",
    "3 .   decays rates are slow ; typically several minutes .",
    "the optimal half - life for a beta beam type machine is @xmath36(1 sec ) .",
    "all these issues conspire to make the desired useful rate of @xmath37 ion decays per year extremely hard . to date , no extensive r&d has been carried out on the possible yearly rates for the rare - earth nuclei sought for electron capture machines .",
    "however , code adapted from the baseline beta beam study has been used to simulate estimate rates with the same vacuum and accelerator conditions  @xcite . assuming a round gaussian beam of ions , the self - field incoherent tune shift was found to be large .",
    "increased intensities in the acceleration only worsen the space charge problem .",
    "this problem can be tempered by leaving extra electrons on the ions , thus reducing the charge ; however , such a strategy reduces the maximum boost attainable .",
    "this is not necessarily bad , as the results of the simulation in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] indicate that the maximum boost @xmath28 = 440 may not be necessary",
    ". a possible strategy could be to leave electrons bound to the ion such that the maximum boost is the sought boost .",
    "for instance , if one requires a boost of @xmath28 = 150 , 44 electrons can be left bound to the dy nucleus .",
    "the tune - shift has a charge - squared dependence , so we decrease its effect by a factor of 9 with this action .",
    "this , however , brings with it a new problem .",
    "the vacuum conditions of the accelerator chain and decay ring are such that the probability of electrons to be stripped from the ion is significant .",
    "since this would alter the charge - to - mass ratio of the ion , the magnetic configuration of the accelerator or decay ring no longer matches that required and the ion is lost .",
    "these losses can be thought of as an extra decay channel .",
    "the annual rate of neutrinos needs to be modified  @xcite : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the decay constants for the electron capture decay and vacuum losses respectively ; @xmath41 is the repetition period for fills in the decay ring ; @xmath42 the total number of ions injected into the decay ring for each fill ; @xmath43 the livetime ( the fraction of the decay ring length that sources the neutrino beam ) ; m is the number of merges in the decay ring and @xmath44 the length of the experimental run in seconds .",
    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath45 secs  @xcite .    ultimately though , the main problem in sourcing a competitive number of useful decays is the half - lives of the ions .",
    "sourcing a beam of mono - energetic neutrinos in this manner requires the use of ions with a fast gamow - teller resonance .",
    "this requirement is very restrictive in terms of the choice of ions . out of the candidates",
    "identified , the fastest decays have weak ec - transitions ; those with dominant resonances have much longer half - lives ( @xmath16 3 mins ) . to realise an electron capture machine therefore will require a thorough search of the gd region of the segre chart for an ion possessing a suitably fast resonant electron capture decay .",
    "it is well known that the analysis of data from a future long baseline facility suffers from the problem of degeneracies  @xcite ; the asymmetry between neutrino and anti - neutrino probabilities , the unknown sign of @xmath15 , and the unknown octant of @xmath46 can all lead to multiple fits to experimental data . for binned data ,",
    "the number of neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) events in the ith neutrino ( anti - neutrino ) energy bin for the pair @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of targets in the detector , @xmath50 is the time of data taking , @xmath51 is the detector efficiency , @xmath52 is the interaction cross section , @xmath53 is the beam spectrum and @xmath54 is the bin width . using the shorthand @xmath55 , the oscillation probability @xmath56 can be expanded in the small parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60  @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , the @xmath63 corresponds to neutrinos / anti - neutrinos and @xmath64 .",

    "the second returns the ` hierarchy clones ' ; the third gives the ` octant ' clones ; and the fourth equation allows for ` mixed ' clones .",

    "therefore , the energy degeneracy is present in general for two beams of mono - energetic neutrinos ; however , this is not necessarily a nuisance . in section  [ s : results ] , it will be found that a combination of mono - energetic neutrino beams placed almost on first oscillation maximum and on second oscillation maximum provides some of the largest cp - violation sensitivity coverage .",
    "in such a case , the cp - even part of the probability vanishes and the energy degeneracy is located at @xmath98 . since this change will leave the probability invariant , the degenerate region will be the same strength and will be symmetrically placed about the @xmath99 or @xmath100 lines .",
    "the two regions will always be either be cp - conserving or cp - violating at the same time .    in  @xcite",

    "the above argument says that the combination of the maxima is insufficient to completely break the energy degeneracy , but the @xmath12-part of the degeneracy is broken .",
    "the reason why the degeneracy was only present for very small values of @xmath101 in these studies was because the data was binned . if one thinks of the data set as predominantly pairs of bins separated by @xmath102 , the location of the energy degeneracy is different for each pair and only the true solution is statistically significant . or more simply , from eq .",

    "further , although the boost choice in  @xcite returned a very competitive minimum @xmath101 , the sensitivity region was asymmetric in @xmath115 and there existed degeneracy for @xmath116 and @xmath117 . generating and then preparing cp - sensitivity plots for many pairs @xmath118 to compare visually is both computationally intensive and a cumbersome undertaking .",

    "one approach would be to determine the minimum @xmath101 at a given confidence level for a particular experimental parameterisation ; however , for an electron capture machine , this approach is not desirable for two reasons .",

    "the ions suggested for electron capture and bbd in  @xcite had much lower branching ratios around 1  % .",
    "magnetised detectors are necessary for ions with both electron capture and bbd_. for ions that electron capture and bbd , it is necessary to separate @xmath220 and @xmath221 events at the detector . for mind detectors  @xcite ,",
    "the threshold is too high for the intermediate baselines of europe .",
    "magnetised liquid argon or totally active scintillator detectors would be necessary .",
    "however , the previous comment indicates that a factor of 100 is missing to get a useful number of mono - energetic neutrinos of order @xmath37 , so this is a mute point .",
    "_ very large boosts are required to separate bbd and cbd channels in the laboratory frame .",
    "_ cbd will always be the dominant channel .",
    "it is therefore necessary to separate this out from the bbd channel otherwise the mono - energetic nature of the bbd is not being exploited .",
    "failure to do this would result in a beta beam using a high proton number ion with only the endpoint of the flux in use .",
    "the energy split between cbd and bbd in the laboratory frame is @xmath222 , for boost @xmath28 and decay to the k - shell of daughter ion y. for example , @xmath218tl@xmath219 has @xmath223 = 99 kev . for a boost of @xmath224",

    "more conservative binnings of 150 - 200 mev and greater are often considered .",
    "boosts in excess of 800 will be required to have an empty bin between the cbd and bbd fluxes in these cases .",
    "such fluxes require the lhc and will diminish the useful decay rate further due to its leading order @xmath226 dependence .",
    "for all ions with smaller proton numbers , the experimental task will be harder owing to the smaller binding energies .",
    "in short , the implausibility of achieving @xmath227 useful mono - energetic anti - neutrinos per year and separating out the bbd anti - neutrinos from the cbd anti - neutrinos does not make a beta beam - type facility based on bbd a viable future facility .",

    "this is left for a different study .",
    "a electron capture beam provides a means to source long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments with a mono - energetic @xmath229 flux . by altering the lorentz boost of the ion",
    ", one can freely choose the laboratory neutrino energy up to some maximum determined by the q - value and the maximum energy of the accelerator .",
    "since a single neutrino energy is insufficient to determine the unknown neutrino mixing parameters and resolve any degeneracy , it is necessary to include at least two boosts in any physics strategy . in the present article ,",
    "a previous work  @xcite examining the physics reach of an electron capture beam sourced from cern and directed towards a 440 kton fiducial mass water cerenkov detector was extended to include the study of the choice of boost , the relative run times of each boost , the number of useful ion decays , and the number of atmospheric neutrino events . the use of neutrinos only , but with multiple energies introduces a variant on the intrinsic degeneracy that is not present in studies that use both neutrino and anti - neutrinos .",
    "this ` energy degeneracy ' was discussed and shown to present in electron capture beam facilities unless the two oscillation phases @xmath230 are separated by @xmath91 and the cp - phase  takes a specific value .    in the first instance , the number of useful decays was fixed to @xmath37 per year , and atmospheric backgrounds were neglected .",
    "little variation was found for the relative run times ; however , two regions of the   plane returned large cp - coverage . the naive pairing of ( almost ) first and second oscillation maximum had a cp - coverage of approximately 35  % but was asymmetric in @xmath115 . for @xmath6 ,",

    "is normally taken as necessary to reduce the atmospheric neutrino flux to a level that does not destroy the sensitivity .",
    "the next step , therefore , was to examine the cp - sensitivity as a function of both the yearly useful decay rate and the number of atmospheric neutrino events in the appearance sample . in both cases ,",
    "the results were more volatile to small changes in the useful decay rate than the atmospheric background .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath3 and @xmath235 events per year , the cp - coverage is approximately 35  % in both cases .",
    "if the decay rate is dropped by a factor of 2 , then the coverage falls to about 23  % .",
    "if instead the atmospheric background is doubled , then the coverage only drops to about 32  % .",
    "the principle reason for this difference is the total event has manifestations in both the numerator and denomenator of the @xmath103 function whereas the background only affects the denomenator .",
    "the discrepancy between two  is felt though the difference squared in the numerator .",
    "drops in the total event rate can therefore lead to degenerate solutions dropping below the required statistical significance of the test thus reducing the sensitivity in a manner beyond simply a scaling of the @xmath103 .",
    "the background merely reduces the @xmath103 without interfering with its ability to rule out degenerate solutions .",
    "its manifestation is simply to push the sensitivity contours inwards .     and @xmath236 per year for = ( 440,150 ) ( black solid ) and ( 280,160 ) ( blue dot - dashed ) .",
    "the red dashed line displays the physics return for a standard beta beam directed along the cern - canfranc baseline with a boost @xmath237 for both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos.,width=264 ]    ultimately , the limiting factor for an electron capture machine is the number of useful decays .",
    "the advantages of using a mono - energetic neutrino beam is the precise knowledge of the neutrino energy and ability to choose which part of the oscillatory structure of the appearance probability is to be explored .",
    "ironically these are also the main disadvantages .",
    "since a single energy is insufficient to extract the unknown mixing parameters , it is necessary to run for substantial periods of time at low energies where the event rate is small .",
    "the availability of an equivalent anti - neutrino beam would remove this necessity .",
    "ions that bound beta decay could source such a beam ; however , this will not be practical with the available technology .",
    "the feasibility of an electron capture beam is an open question .",
    "however , the most optimistic parameterisation considered in this article is likely to be beyond the hard limits imposed by available technology . it must be conceded that if 13 were to be very small , the electron capture will not be a competitive facility , unless a fast decaying ion that can be produced in large quantities is found",
    "this can be seen explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fi : comparison ] where the cp - discovery for the boost pairs ( 280,160 ) and ( 440,150 ) , and 20 atmospheric events per year , are compared to the @xmath238 350,350 beta beam introduced in  @xcite with the baseline shortened to cern - canfranc , as in this article .",
    "the simulation of this facility uses @xmath239 neutrinos per year sourced from the decay of @xmath196ne , and @xmath240 anti - neutrinos per year sourced from decays of @xmath197he .",
    "the run time is 10 years with an equal split between neutrino and anti - neutrino running .",
    "we see that for a ( 440,150 ) electron capture facility , the physics return is poorer but relatively competitive for @xmath119 . for these @xmath1 ,",
    "the ( 280,160 ) facility is only competitive for @xmath140 $ ] . for @xmath150 ,",
    "the ( 440,150 ) facility is outperformed by the standard beta beam by 2 orders of magnitude whilst , again the ( 280,160 ) facility is only competitive for @xmath140 $ ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "an electron capture machine is unlikely to be a competitive facility for the measurement of cp - violation .",
    "taking into account technological challenges and restrictions , the cp - violation reach of a possible electron capture machine is probably going to be limited to 2 @xmath241 .",
    "this is not to say that an electron capture machine is a redundant option .",
    "the sensitivity suffered from the need to run for substantial periods of time at low energies . if the electron capture machine is used in combination with another facility , this will be become unnecessary .",
    "in such a scenario the role of the machine would be to complement a facility that has both neutrino and anti - neutrino fluxes and/or coverage of a large energy range . in this case",
    ", the electron capture machine could be run for 100  % of the time at a well chosen energy to compensate for any deficiency in the physics reach of the other facility .",
    "the author would like to thank silvia pascoli , sergio palomares - ruiz and jose bernabeu for discussions and suggesting improvements to the manuscript ; mats lindroos for advice on the production and acceleration ; dan roythorne for a discussion on the simulation strategy ; and the cern isolde group for their hospitally on a number of occasions early in the study .",
    "this work was carried out under a stfc studentship and additionally supported by the european community under the european commission framework programme 7 design studies : euronu , project number 212372 ; and laguna , project number 212343 .",
