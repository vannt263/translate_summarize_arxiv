    "recent observations provide evidence that a mass of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in a galactic nucleus is tightly correlated with a mass or luminosity of a spheroid component of its host galaxy ( e.g. , magorrian et al . 1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 , mh03 hereafter ) .",
    "the tight correlation suggests the presence of strong evolutionary link between smbh and spheroid component . using the relation , an smbh mass function ( bhmf )",
    "can be derived from local galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) or velocity dispersion function . meanwhile , a local bhmf can also be calculated from cosmological evolution of lfs of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) by integrating the continuity equation for number density of smbhs , where mass accretion onto a smbh is assumed to power an agn and grow the central smbh ( e.g. , cavaliere , morrison & wood 1971 ; small & blandford 1992 ; marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "bhmfs derived by this method can now be more reliable than before thanks to updated lfs of hard x - ray selected agns ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is more complete to obscured agns .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2004 ) and shankar et al . ( 2004 ) demonstrate that the local densities of smbhs and bhmfs derived with these two ways agree with each other , if one adopts reasonable values for accretion efficiency and eddington ratio .",
    "furthermore , marconi et al . (",
    "2004 ) indicate that the cosmic history of mass accretion rate density delineates that of star - formation rate density , and the ratio of the latter to the former is about 4000 , which agrees with the mass ratio of a spheroid to a central smbh , again strongly suggesting the co - evolution of smbhs and spheroids .    in studying the co - evolution of smbhs and host spheroids in further detail ,",
    "one approach is to investigate redshift evolution of bhmf and correlation between black hole mass ( @xmath11 ) and spheroid luminosity ( @xmath2 ) or mass .",
    "while @xmath11 has been measured for a substantial number of high redshift qsos ( e.g. , shields et al .",
    "2003 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ) , it is technically challenging to directly measure dormant smbhs at cosmological distances .",
    "however , bhmfs at high redshifts can be computed using agn lfs and the continuity equation in the same way as in the local universe . also , we are now in a reasonable position to be able to study bhmfs at intermediate redshifts by using lfs of early - type galaxies .",
    "early - type galaxy lfs have recently been derived out to @xmath0 with good statistics from intensive imaging surveys such as combo-17 ( wolf et al .",
    "2003 ; bell et al .",
    "consequently , one can compare bhmfs from the galaxy lfs with those from agn lfs , which may provide clues to understand the co - evolution of agns and host spheroids .    in this paper",
    ", we will derive bhmfs at intermediate redshifts from galaxy lfs and agn lfs and investigate the redshift evolutions . when converting galaxy lfs to bhmfs , a correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath2 is utilized .",
    "although a correlation between @xmath11 and bulge effective stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath12 ) is claimed to be tighter than that between @xmath11 and @xmath2 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , measuring @xmath12 at cosmological distance is very hard and we thus adopt the @xmath13 relation in this work . it should also be emphasized that mh03 show the @xmath1 relation is as tight as that between @xmath11 and @xmath12 if only smbhs whose masses are securely determined are used in the analysis . in addition , mh03 suggest that the intrinsic scatter of the relation in @xmath14-band is as small as in nir bands .",
    "one should be aware that the derivation of a bhmf from galaxy lfs contains several processes which may give significant uncertainties to resultant bhmfs .",
    "quantifying uncertainties in bhmfs when calculated from galaxy lfs is also aimed at in this paper .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in the next section (   [ sphbhmf ] )",
    ", we describe the procedure to derive a bhmf from an early - type galaxy lf and calculate bhmfs from early - type galaxy lfs up to @xmath0 .",
    "we also investigate how bhmfs are affected by uncertainties and unconstrained parameters existing in this derivation . in",
    "  [ agnbhmf ] , we derive bhmfs from agn lfs and examine its redshift evolution . in",
    "  [ discussion ] , we compare the bhmfs from early - type galaxy lfs with those from agn lfs and discuss the results . throughout this paper , we adopt the cosmological model with @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 unless otherwise stated .",
    "in this paper , we mainly use the lfs obtained by bell et al .",
    "( 2004b ) from the combo-17 survey .",
    "the large survey area with the moderate depth brings a large number of galaxies , and the multi - band photometry covering from 3640    to 9140   with the 17 broad- and medium - band filters allows one to accurately determine the photometric redshifts .",
    "both of these aspects are important to derive luminosity functions with good accuracy and the large survey area is especially useful to estimate its cosmic variance .",
    "they firstly investigated the rest - frame @xmath19 vs. @xmath20 colour - magnitude diagram of galaxies at a certain redshift and found the red sequence consistent with the colour - magnitude relation well established for the early - type galaxy population .",
    "they select galaxies on the red sequence and derive their rest - frame @xmath14-band lfs at redshifts from 0.25 to 1.05 .",
    "bell et al .",
    "( 2004b ) also derived the @xmath14-band lf of the local red sequence galaxies using the sdss edr data ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) by transforming the sdss @xmath21 system to the standard @xmath22 system .",
    "we use the schechter functions fitted to these lfs in the following analyses .",
    "a part of the survey area of the combo-17 was imaged with the hst / acs and most of the galaxies on the red sequence ( @xmath23 % ) indeed show early - type morphology ( bell et al .",
    "it should be noted that the colour selection based on the red sequence is presumed to exclude blue ellipticals with star formation activity and/or young stellar population .",
    "in addition , small bulges in late - type galaxies can be missed , which perhaps results in a deficiency of the light part of a bhmf .    in order to convert these lfs to bhmfs ,",
    "firstly the total galaxy luminosities need to be transformed to the spheroid luminosities using bulge - to - total luminosity ratios ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25s of early - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts are , however , not well constrained observationally .",

    "the @xmath25s do not depend on redshift or luminosity in their sample .",
    "therefore we adopt @xmath29 in this study , independently of redshift and galaxy luminosity .",

    "the relation is derived for @xmath2 in the @xmath14 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 bands .",
    "although the relation in @xmath33-band is generally preferred because @xmath33-band luminosity is considered to be the most reliable indicator of the stellar mass of a galaxy , mh03 show the intrinsic scatter of the relation is almost independent of the bands for the galaxies in group 1 . since we will mainly use the @xmath14-band lfs by bell et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , we adopt the @xmath14-band relation described as follows :    @xmath34    in applying the @xmath1 relation to an lf , the intrinsic scatter of the relation needs to be considered ; we adopt @xmath35 according to mh03 .    in calculating a bhmf from a spheroid lf at a high redshift , an evolution of the @xmath1 relation needs to be considered . in this study , we basically consider only the effect of passive evolution in @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that if all spheroid components evolve only passively ( with no growth of smbhs ) , then the bhmf at the intermediate redshift does not change from that at @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , it is not obvious that all spheroids evolve passively at intermediate redshifts .",
    "any other evolutions in galaxy lfs and the @xmath1 relation would cause the disagreement between bhmfs from galaxy lf and agn lf , which will be discussed in   [ discussion ] .",
    "we describe the passive luminosity evolution as @xmath37 and assume @xmath38 to be 1.4 .",
    "this is evaluated using pegase ver 2.0 ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) for a stellar population with the solar metallicity formed at @xmath39 ( the age at @xmath40 is 12 gyr ) in a single starburst with an @xmath41-folding time of 1 gyr .",

    "the uncertainty in @xmath46 is dominated by cosmic variance ( bell et al .",

    "the bhmfs in figure [ relevo ] exhibit a redshift evolution . since the characteristic @xmath11 does not largely change with redshift , this evolution is perhaps due to a density evolution of bhmfs corresponding to the decreasing normalization of the red sequence galaxy lfs ( bell et al .",

    "currently , the combo-17 survey provides one of the largest and most useful databases to study galaxies out to @xmath0 and the derived early - type galaxy lfs are therefore considered to be the most reliable so far .",

    "it is suggested by mh03 to be between 0.3 and 0.4 ( see also mclure & dunlop 2002 ) , but we note that if observational errors in @xmath11 are underestimated , the intrinsic scatter would be smaller .",

    "black solid line is the @xmath14-band @xmath1 relation by mh03 and the other lines indicate those obtained by correcting the @xmath33-band relation for a - cmr ( grey solid line ) , t - cmr ( dotted line ) , and the average @xmath59 colour ( dashed line ) . _ lower panel _ : bhmfs calculated from ilf using the above @xmath14-band relations are indicated.,width=264 ]    we will compare bhmfs derived from ilf using the @xmath4 relations calculated by mh03 either in the @xmath14 band or @xmath33 band . in order to apply the @xmath33-band relation to ilf ( @xmath14 band ) , we need to convert the @xmath33-band relation to a @xmath14-band relation by correcting it for @xmath59 colour .",
    "this can be performed by using the average colour of early - type galaxy population ( e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "we adopt @xmath60 estimated by girardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for local elliptical and s0 galaxies in field and group environments .",
    "this colour is similar to that used in marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , where @xmath61 = 4.1 for ellipticals and 3.95 for s0s ( @xmath62 is zwicky magnitude ) are used in applying the @xmath33-band @xmath63 relation to the lfs from the cfa survey ( marzke et al .",
    "these colours are based on actual measurements by kochanek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and they are converted to @xmath59 = 3.59 and 3.44 , respectively , by using the equation @xmath64 given by aller & richstone ( 2002 ) .    however , this correction ignores the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "in fact , bell et al . ( 2004b ) suggest that the red sequence galaxies in the combo-17 survey are on the cmr which is consistent with those found for e / s0s both in clusters ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; terlevich , caldwell & bower 2001 ) and fields ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , we attempt to take this into account . since cmrs in @xmath59 have rarely been investigated , we model a cmr using a population synthesis code ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) so as to reproduce an observed cmr in a certain set of filters and we then derive a cmr in @xmath59 and @xmath65 using the model . in this modelling calculation , we follow the recipe by kodama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where they modeled the cmr ( @xmath66 and @xmath20 ) measured in the coma cluster ( bower et al . 1992 ) based on the galactic wind scenario .",
    "it needs to be mentioned that , while a cmr is normally defined using colours within a metric aperture , the one using total colours suits better for this study .",
    "total colours in more luminous ( larger ) galaxies are presumed to be systematically bluer than those measured within an aperture due to more severe effects of the colour gradients ( e.g. , peletier et al .",
    "1990 ; tamura & ohta 2003 ) ; a given aperture can sample only the reddest part of a luminous ( large ) galaxy , but it can include the total light of a faint ( small ) galaxy .",
    "the slope of a cmr using total colours ( t - cmr hereafter ) is therefore expected to be flatter than that using colours within an aperture ( a - cmr hereafter ) .",
    "this aperture effect on the cmr in the coma cluster ( bower et al .",
    "1992 ) has been investigated by kodama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the slope of the t - cmr at @xmath67 mag is estimated to be @xmath5 30% flatter .",
    "hence we consider a cmr with a slope flatter by 30% than the a - cmr by bower et al .",
    "( 1992 ) as a t - cmr .",
    "km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 is assumed and hence the slope of a t - cmr would be less flat in our cosmology ( @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 ) .",
    "but here we aim at seeing how bhmfs vary by considering the cmrs and precise determination of the slope is beyond our scope .",
    "we note that colours of ellipticals less luminous than @xmath68 mag are considered to be robust to the aperture correction and the actual t - cmr therefore has a break at @xmath69 mag ( see figure 3 in kodama et al .",
    "we ignore this and determine the zeropoint of the t - cmr so as to reproduce the total colours of the ellipticals with @xmath70 mag .",
    "although this indicates that the t - cmr gives too red colours to less luminous ellipticals , the impact of this on a bhmf is very small and does not affect the following discussions . ]    in figure [ cmr ] , the @xmath14-band @xmath1 relations are shown in the upper panel .",

    "it is indicated that the @xmath33-band relation is not fully transformed to the @xmath14-band relation by mh03 even if a cmr is taken into account , and the bhmfs come towards the less massive end than the case where the @xmath14-band relation by mh03 is applied to ilf .",
    "this may imply that , while the tightness of the @xmath14-band @xmath1 relation is nearly the same as that of the @xmath33-band relation , the relations are not equivalent to each other .",
    "one possible reason for this discrepancy may be that @xmath14 band luminosity is less good indicator of stellar mass due to effects of dust extinction and/or young stellar population for some of the galaxies used in the analysis of the @xmath1 relations .",
    "it should be noted that the bhmf comes towards the less massive end when the average @xmath59 colour is used than when a cmr is considered because the adopted average colour is bluer than colours of luminous early - type galaxies .",
    "consequently , their @xmath14-band luminosities are overestimated and therefore smaller values of @xmath11 are assigned to spheroids with a certain @xmath14-band luminosity . for the same reason ,",

    "<S> the resultant bhmfs ( spheroid - bhmfs ) from lfs of red sequence galaxies indicates a slight decrease of number density with increasing redshift at @xmath3 . since a redshift evolution in slope and zeropoint of </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 relation is unlikely to be capable of making such an evolution in bhmf , the evolution of the spheroid - bhmfs is perhaps due mainly to the decreasing normalization in the galaxy lfs . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive bhmfs from lfs of morphologically selected early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant bhmfs are similar to those from the red sequence galaxies , but show a small discrepancy at @xmath0 corresponding to an increase of smbh number density by @xmath5 0.3 dex . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate how spheroid - bhmfs are affected by uncertainties existing in the derivation in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> the other way of deriving a bhmf is based on the continuity equation for number density of smbhs and lfs of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant bhmfs ( agn - bhmfs ) show no clear evolution out to @xmath6 at @xmath7 , but exhibit a significant decrease with redshift in the lower mass range . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these agn - bhmfs are quite different in the range of @xmath8 from those derived by merloni ( 2004 ) , where the fundamental plane of black hole activity is exploited .    comparison of the spheroid - bhmfs with the agn - bhmfs suggests that at @xmath9 , the spheroid - bhmfs are broadly consistent with the agn - bhmfs out to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> although the decrease of smbh number density with redshift suggested by the spheroid - bhmfs is slightly faster than that suggested by the agn - bhmfs , we presume this to be due at least partly to a selection effect on the lfs of red sequence galaxies ; the colour selection could miss spheroids with blue colours . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the spheroid - bhmfs and the agn - bhmfs appears to support that most of the smbhs are already hosted by massive spheroids at @xmath10 and they evolve without significant mass growth since then .    </S>",
