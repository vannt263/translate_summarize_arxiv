    "the original idea of kaluza and klein is based on the hypothesis that the input space - time is a @xmath1-dimensional space @xmath2 which can be represented as a tensor product of the visible four - dimensional world @xmath3 with a compact internal @xmath4-dimensional space @xmath5 _ ( 4+d ) = m_4 k_d . [ 1 ] the compact internal space @xmath5 is space - like one i.e. it has only spatial dimensions which may be considered as extra spatial dimensions of @xmath3 . in according with the tensor product structure of the space @xmath6 the metric may be chosen in a factorizable form .",
    "this means that if @xmath7 , ( @xmath8 ) , are local coordinates on @xmath6 then the factorizable metric looks like @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the metric on @xmath3 .    in the year 1921 , kaluza proposed a unification of the einstein gravity and the maxwell theory of electromagnetism in four dimensions starting from einstein gravity in five dimensions .",
    "he assumed that the five - dimensional space @xmath11 had to be a product of a four - dimensional space - time @xmath3 and a circle @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "after that the metric @xmath14 in @xmath11 can be decomposed into 10 components describing einstein gravity tensor @xmath15 , four components @xmath16 forming an electromagnetic gauge field , and one component @xmath17 representing a scalar field .",
    "it was shown that the zero mode sector of the kaluza model ( the model is actually a five - dimensional einstein gravity ) is equivalent to the four - dimensional theory which describes the einstein gravity with a four - dimensional general coordinate transformations and the maxwell theory of electromagnetism with a gauge transformations . in his original work",
    ", kaluza assumed the zero mode of scalar field had to be positive constant in order to insure a positive energy .",
    "recently some models with extra dimensions have been proposed to attack the electroweak quantum instability of the standard model known as hierarchy problem between the electroweak and gravity scales . to illustrate the main idea how the hierarchy problem may be solved in a theory with extra dimensions let us consider the einstein @xmath1-dimensional gravity with the action",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 , and the ricci scalar curvature @xmath20 is defined by the metric @xmath21 . by the mode expanding and integrating over @xmath22 one",
    "obtains the four - dimensional action @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is einstein gravity tensor on @xmath3 , and the ricci scalar curvature @xmath26 is defined by the metric @xmath25 , @xmath27 is four - dimensional gravitational newton constant related with the fundamental constant @xmath28 by the following equation g_n = g_(4+d ) , [ g ] where @xmath29 is the volume of the compact internal space @xmath5 .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) in terms of the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath30 and a fundamental mass scale of the @xmath1-dimensional gravity @xmath31 m_pl^2 = v_d m^d+2 .",
    "[ m ] the latter formula is often cited as the reduction formula .",
    "if @xmath32 is a characteristic size of @xmath5 then @xmath33 , i.e. we suppose @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is some constant .",
    "( [ m ] ) gives m_pl = c_d^1/2m(mr)^d/2.[m2 ] now , it s clear that , if the size @xmath32 of the compact internal space @xmath5 is large compared to the fundamental length @xmath36 , the planck mass is much larger than the fundamental gravity scale .",
    "going further on , if we suppose that the fundamental gravity scale is of the same order as the electroweak scale , @xmath37 , then a huge gap between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is resulted from the large size of the internal extra space @xmath5 .",
    "so , the hierarchy problem replaces by the hierarchy @xmath40 and becomes the problem to explain why the size @xmath32 of extra space @xmath5 is large . from eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , assuming that @xmath37 , it follows r~m^-1()^2/d~10",
    "^ 32/d 10 ^ -17cm.[r ] or @xmath41 an exceptional case @xmath42 gives @xmath43 , ( @xmath44 ) and this is certainly a quite interesting observation . in the case @xmath45 we have @xmath46 , i.e. this case is excluded by unacceptable large value of @xmath32 . for @xmath47",
    "one obtains @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50    it is obviously that the basic idea of the kaluza - klein scenario may be applied to any model in quantum field theory .",
    "as example , let us consider the simplest case of ( 4+d)-dimensional model of scalar field with the action s = d^4+dz , [ s ] where @xmath19 , @xmath51 is the metric on @xmath52 , @xmath3 is pseudo - euclidean minkowski space - time , @xmath5 is a compact internal @xmath4-dimensional space with the characteristic size @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the laplace operator on the internal space @xmath22 , and @xmath54 are ortho - normalized eigenfunctions of the laplace operator _",
    "k_d y_n(y ) = - y_n(y ) , [ yn ] and @xmath55 is a ( multi)index labeling the eigenvalue @xmath56 of the eigenfunction @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath4-dimensional torus @xmath57 with equal radii @xmath32 is an especially simple example of the compact internal space of extra dimensions @xmath5 .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in this special case look like y_n(y ) = ( i _ m=1^d n_my^m / r ) , [ t ] @xmath58 where @xmath59 are integer numbers , @xmath60 is the volume of the torus .    to reduce the multidimensional theory to the effective four - dimensional one we wright a harmonic expansion for the multidimensional field @xmath61 ( z ) = ( x , y ) = _ n ^(n)(x ) y_n(y ) .",
    "[ h ] the coefficients @xmath62 of the harmonic expansion ( [ h ] ) are called kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations or kk modes , and they usually include the zero - mode @xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath64 and the eigenvalue @xmath65 .",
    "substitution of the kk mode expansion into action ( [ s ] ) and integration over the internal space @xmath22 gives s = d^4x \\ { ( _ ^(0 ) ) ^2 - ( ^(0))^2 .",
    "+ ( ^(0))^4 + @xmath66   + \\frac{g}{4 ! } ( \\phi^{(0)})^{2 } \\sum_{n\\neq 0 } \\phi^{(n ) } \\phi^{(n)*}\\right\\ } + \\ldots.\\ ] ] for the masses of the kk modes one obtains m_n^2 = m^2 + , [ m ] and the coupling constant @xmath67 of the four - dimensional theory is related to the coupling constant @xmath28 of the initial multidimensional theory by the equation g = , [ g ] where @xmath29 is the volume of the compact internal space of extra dimensions @xmath5 .",
    "the fundamental coupling constant @xmath28 has dimension @xmath68^{-d}$ ] .",
    "so , the four - dimensional coupling constant @xmath67 is dimensionless one as it should be .",
    "( [ m],[g ] ) represent the basic relations of kaluza - klein scenario .",
    "similar relations take place for other types of multidimensional quantum field theoretical models . from four - dimensional point of view",
    "we can interpret each kk mode as a particle with the mass @xmath69 given by eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) .",
    "we see that in according with kaluza - klein scenario any multidimensional field contains an infinite set of kk modes , i.e. an infinite set of four - dimensional particles with increasing masses , which is called the kaluza - klein tower .",
    "therefore , an experimental observation of series kk excitations with a characteristic spectrum of the form ( [ m ] ) would be an evidence of the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "so far the kk partners of the particles of the standard model have not been observed . in the kaluza - klein scenario",
    "this fact can be explained by a microscopic small size @xmath32 of extra dimensions ( @xmath70 ) ; in that case the kk excitations may be produced only at super - high energies of the scale @xmath71 .",
    "below this scale only homogeneous zero modes with @xmath64 are accessible ones for an observation in recent high energy experiments .",
    "that is why , there is a hope to search the kk excitations at the future lhc and other colliders .",
    "however , as we have mentioned above , the solution of hierarchy problem motivated vice versa to introduce the internal extra space with a large size ( @xmath43 ) . to resolve this obvious contradiction",
    "recently it has been proposed a remarkable idea of  brane world picture \" according to which all matter fields ( except gravity ) are localized on a three - dimensional submanifold ",
    "brane  embedded in fundamental multidimensional space . in the brane world scenario",
    "extra dimensions may have large and even very large size ; they may also have experimentally observable effects .",
    "even though the models with the brane world scenario may rather seem as exotic ones , nevertheless , they provide a base for a nontrivial phenomenological issues related to the fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "we refer with a pleasure the interested reader to the excellent review articles @xcite and many references therein .",
    "in this note we would like to argue in favour of that the extra dimensions have been observed for a long time in the experiments at very low energies where the nucleon - nucleon dynamics has been studied . in this respect , we would like to show that the structure of proton - proton total cross section at very low energies has a clear signature of the existence of the extra dimensions .",
    "recently a simple theoretical formula describing the global structure of proton - proton total cross - section in the whole range of energies available up today has been derived .",
    "the fit to the experimental data with the formula was made , and it was shown that there is a very good correspondence of the theoretical formula to the existing experimental data obtained at the accelerators @xcite .",
    "moreover it turned out there is a very good correspondence of the theory to all existing cosmic ray experimental data as well .",
    "the predicted values for @xmath72 obtained from theoretical description of all existing accelerators data are completely compatible with the values obtained from cosmic ray experiments @xcite .",
    "the global structure of proton - proton total cross section is shown in fig . 1 extracted from paper @xcite .    ( 288,200 ) ( 15,10 ) ( 144,0)@xmath73 ( -5,95 )    the theoretical formula describing the global structure of proton - proton total cross section has the following form    @xmath74,\\ ] ] @xmath75(gev^{-2}),\\ ] ] @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80}.\\ ] ] for the numerical values of the parameters @xmath81 see original paper @xcite .",
    "the mathematical structure of the formula is very simple and physically transparent : the total cross section is represented in a factorized form ; one factor describes high energy asymptotics of total cross section and it has the universal energy dependence predicted by the general theorems in local quantum field theory ( froissart theorem ) ; the other factor is responsible for the behaviour of total cross section at low energies and it has a complicated resonance structure . the nontrivial feature of the formula is the presence of the new  threshold \" @xmath82 which is near the elastic one .    some information concerning the diproton resonances is collected in table 1 .",
    "the positions of resonances and their widths , listed in table 1 , were fixed in our fit , and only relative contributions of the resonances @xmath83 have been considered as free fit parameters .",
    "fitted parameters @xmath83 obtained by the fit are listed in table 1 too .",
    "diproton resonances .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the constraint ( [ dio ] ) corresponds to the special ( diophantus ! ) selection of the states .",
    "it s clear that in general case of generic extra compact manifold we would have a significantly more wealthy spectrum of kk - excitations .",
    "we could imagine that there exist such extra compact manifold with a suitable geometry where kk - excitations of a few input fundamental entities ( proton , electron , photon , etc . )",
    "would provide the experimentally observed spectrum of all particles , their resonances and nuclei states . as we hope , it would be possible to find in this way the _ global _ solution of the spectral problem . anyhow ,",
    "we believe that such perfect extra compact manifold with a beautiful geometry and its good - looking shapes exist .",
    "in this short article we have presented some arguments in favour of kaluza and klein ideas genius which are waiting their time in high - energy experiments at future colliders .",
    "in fact , we have shown that kaluza - klein picture of the world has been confirmed in the experiments at very low energies where the nucleon - nucleon dynamics has been studied .",
    "geniusly simple formula",
    "( [ kk ] ) provided by kaluza - klein approach so accurately describes the mass spectrum of diproton system , it s very nice ; certainly , it is not an accidental coincidence .",
    "here we have concerned the simplest model where the protons were considered as a scalar particles .",
    "it is well known that account of fermionic degrees of freedom may result the nontrivial problems related to both the index and the kernel of dirac operator on a generic compact manifold .",
    "however , since the kernel of dirac operator is equal to the kernel of its square , we can say with confidence that account of fermionic degrees of freedom for a proton will not change our main conclusion .",
    "this conclusion is that the existence of the extra dimensions was experimentally proved for a long time , but we did not understand it .",
