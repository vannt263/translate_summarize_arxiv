    "studies of patterns in the magnetic flux distribution in the type - ii superconductors are attracting the attention of many research groups vlasko - vlascov , koblischka , johansen , duran whose magneto - optical experiments demonstrate that nonuniform flux penetration occurs .",
    "patterns with branch - like structures have been found in most of high @xmath0 materials , like @xmath1@xcite and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the nucleation of dendrite like patterns in @xmath3 films is another example @xcite .",
    "these complex structures consist of alternating low and high vortex density regions and are found in a certain temperature window .",
    "likewise , flux penetration in the form of droplets separating areas of different densities of vortices has been observed in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "usually the occurrence of flux patterns in interfacial growth phenomena can be attributed to a diffusion driven , long - wavelength instability of a straight front , similar to the mullens - sekerka instability @xcite found in crystal growth .",
    "the nucleation of nonuniform patterns associated with the propagation of a flux front into a flux - free sample has been attributed to such an interfacial instability .",
    "this results from a thermomagnetic coupling johansen02,barkov , mints , aranson01,rakhmanov04 where a higher temperature leads to a higher vortex mobility , enhanced flux flow , and hence a larger heat generation .",
    "_ on the other hand , the situation when the vortices interact in a superconductor with the flux of the opposite sign is less theoretically studied_. this flux configurations arises for example when a dc bias current creates vortices and antivortices on the opposite side of the superconducting strip @xcite .",
    "another example which is now under intensive investigation arises upon exposing the previously magnetized sample to the magnetic field of an opposite direction . according to the experimental data @xcite , the boundary between vortices and antivortices exhibits many features suggestive of a long wavelength instability .",
    "the cause of the instability at the boundary between fluxes of opposite sign is still being debated . in particular , fisher at el .",
    "@xcite proposed a non thermomagnetic mechanism of instability caused by an in - plane anisotropy of the vortex mobility .",
    "this mechanism of instability was carefully reinvestigate by the van saarloos et el @xcite .",
    "they confirmed the finding of fisher et el .",
    "@xcite that standing vortex - antivortex fronts have an instability to a modulated state , while the moving fronts were found to be stable for all anisotropies .",
    "in fact however , the flux - antiflux instability was experimentally detected in a system with small @xcite and moderate anisotropy @xcite .",
    "several years latter this model was improved by an additional assumption of a step shape and anisotropy of the voltage current characteristics @xcite and explained the experimental result in moderate anisotropic superconductor @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately this assumption can not explain the instability in pure isotropic systems like @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand the thermomagnetic mechanism can also be responsible for flux - antiflux instability when the flux - antiflux front is heated both by the vortex ( antivortex ) dynamics and by the vortex - antivortex annihilation .",
    "in this paper we report on the thermomagnetic theory of the flux - antiflux instability in anisotropic layered superconductor .",
    "we start with a model of two - component vortex gas @xcite spatially homogeneous along the @xmath8 axes , which is valid for the experimentally interesting situation of the low magnetic field when typical spacing between vortices @xmath9 essentially exceeds vortex - vortex ( antivortex ) interaction radius @xmath10 , and the vortex velocity depends only on the edge screening current that is assumed to be homogeneously distributed across the sample .",
    "the vortex - vortex repulsion , in this case , keeping the number of vortices , can not play a significant role .",
    "one must take into account both vortex - antivortex annihilation and heat release accompanying this process .",
    "we should also take into consideration heat absorption by the sample lattice in order to prevent the rise of unlimited temperature .",
    "the vortex - antivortex annihilation obeys the well - known master equations of the recombination theory @xcite@xmath11@xmath12@xmath13where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the vortex and antivortex densities , respectively , @xmath16 is the ratio of recombination for vortices and antivortices , @xmath10 is the cross section of the annihilation , which is of the order of the coherence length of the superconductor , and @xmath17 are the opposite directed vortex - antivortex velocities , which in the creep regime are strongly temperature dependent:@xmath18@xmath19    here , @xmath20 is a temperature - dependent pinning potential , @xmath21 is the unit flux , @xmath22 is the electric current , and @xmath23 is the viscosity of the vortices , which in an anisotropic system is a tensor with different in plane and across the plane tensor components @xmath24 .",
