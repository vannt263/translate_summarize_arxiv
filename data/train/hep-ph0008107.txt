    "they are induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at loop level in the standard model ( sm ) and with the forthcoming experiments , it would be possible to test the flavour sector of the sm in a high precision , as well as to reveal the physics beyond , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc .    among the rare b decays ,",

    "this decay is induced by @xmath4 transition at the quark level and in the literature it has been investigated extensively for @xmath5 in the sm , 2hdm and mssm @xcite- @xcite . when @xmath5 , the neutral higgs boson ( nhb ) effects are safely neglected in the 2hdm because they enter in the expressions with the factor @xmath6 . however , for @xmath7 , this factor is not negligible and nhb effects can give important contribution . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath8 process was studied in the 2hdm and it was shown that nhb effects are sizable for large values of @xmath9 .    in this work ,",
    "we study the @xmath10 decay in the general 2hdm , so - called model iii .",
    "we include nhb effects and make the full calculation using the on - shell renormalization prescription .",
    "we investigate the dependencies of the differential decay width @xmath11 and the decay width @xmath12 on the scale invariant lepton mass square `` @xmath13 '' and some model iii parameters , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 .",
    "further , we calculate the differential ( direct ) forward - backward asymmetry @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) of the lepton pair in terms of the above parameters .",
    "we show that a large enhancement is possible in the decay width of the process @xmath10 for some values of the model iii parameters and nhb effects become considerable for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the leading order ( lo ) qcd corrected effective hamiltonian and the corresponding matrix element for the inclusive @xmath10 decay .",
    "further , we give the expression for @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the lepton pair .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the new wilson coefficients coming from the nhb effects and the dependencies of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the the yukawa couplings @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the charged higgs mass @xmath14 , the parameter s and to the discussion of our results . in appendices ,",
    "we give the explicit forms of the operators appearing in the effective hamiltonian and the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "model iii ( 2hdm ) permits the flavour changing neutral currents in the tree level and the prize is various new parameters , i.e. yukawa couplings .",
    "these couplings are responsible for the interaction of quarks and leptons with gauge bosons , namely , the yukawa interaction and in this general case it reads as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote chiral projections @xmath23 , @xmath24 , for @xmath25 , are the two scalar doublets , @xmath26 are quark and lepton doublets , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the corresponding singlets , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the matrices of the yukawa couplings .",

    "is defined by the expression @xmath40 here the charged couplings appear as linear combinations of neutral couplings multiplied by @xmath41 matrix elements ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "now we would like to start with the calculation of the matrix element for the inclusive @xmath0 decay .",
    "the procedure is to integrate out the heavy degrees of freedom , namely @xmath42 quark , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 bosons in the present case and obtain the effective theory . here",
    "@xmath45 denote charged , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath44 denote neutral higgs bosons . note that @xmath47 and @xmath44 are the same as the mass eigenstates @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the model iii respectively , due to the choice given by eq .",
    "( [ choice ] ) .",
    "the qcd corrections are done through matching the full theory with the effective low energy one at the high scale @xmath50 and evaluating the wilson coefficients from @xmath51 down to the lower scale @xmath52 . in the model iii ( similar to the models",
    "i and ii , 2hdm ) neutral higgs particles bring new contributions to the matrix element of the process @xmath0 ( see eq.([nhb ] ) ) since they enter in the expressions with the mass of @xmath53 lepton or related yukawa coupling @xmath54 . as being different from the model i and ii ,",
    "in the model iii , there exist additional operators which are the flipped chirality partners of the former ones .",
    "however , the effects of the latter are negligible since the corresponding wilson coefficients are small due to the discussion given in section 3 .",

    "<S> we study the decay width and forward - backward asymmetry of the lepton pair for the inclusive decay @xmath0 in the two higgs doublet model with three level flavor changing neutral currents ( model iii ) and analyse the dependencies of these quantities on the model iii parameters , including the leading order qcd corrections . </S>",
