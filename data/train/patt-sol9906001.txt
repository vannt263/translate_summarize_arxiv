    "the externally driven , damped nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , @xmath6 arises in a variety of fields including plasma and condensed matter physics , nonlinear optics and superconducting electronics . in some of these applications ( e.g. in the study of the optical soliton propagation in a diffractive or dispersive ring cavity in the presence of an input forcing beam @xcite ; in the description of easy - axis ferromagnets in an external rotating magnetic field perpendicular to the easy axis @xcite ; in the theory of rf - driven waves in plasma @xcite ) eq.([nls_0 ] ) has a direct interpretation . in others",
    " like for instance in charge - density - wave conductors with external electric field @xcite ; shear flows in nematic liquid crystals @xcite ; ac - driven long josephson junctions @xcite , and periodically forced frenkel - kontorova chains @xcite  it occurs as an amplitude equation for small and slowly changing solutions of the externally driven , damped sine - gordon equation : @xmath7    without loss of generality @xmath8 in eq.([nls_0 ] ) can be normalized to unity @xcite ; hence , the driver s strength @xmath0 and dissipation coefficient @xmath2 are the only two essential control parameters . given some @xmath0 and @xmath2 , a fundamental question is what nonlinear attractors will arise at this point of the @xmath9-plane . in their pioneering paper @xcite kaup and newell considered eq.([nls_0 ] ) on the infinite line under the vanishing boundary conditions at infinity . by means of the inverse scattering - based perturbation theory",
    ", these authors have demonstrated that for small @xmath0 and @xmath2 eq.([nls_0 ] ) exhibits two soliton solutions phase - locked to the frequency of the driver .",
    "as @xmath0 is decreased for the fixed @xmath2 , the two solitons approach each other and eventually merge in a turning point for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "consequently , this value plays the role of a threshold ; no solitons exist below @xmath11 .",
    "later the same existence threshold was reobtained by terrones , mclaughlin , overman and pearlstein @xcite in a regular perturbation construction of solutions to ( [ nls_0 ] ) in powers of @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) .    in ref.@xcite equation ( [ nls_0 ] )",
    "was studied , numerically , in the full range of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "it was found that the two soliton solutions persist for @xmath2 up to approximately @xmath12 .",
    "for each @xmath13 there is a turning point at some @xmath14 at which one branch of solitons turns into another , and which plays the role of the lower boundary of the existence region @xcite .",
    "amazingly , kaup and newell s approximate relation @xmath15 was found to remain valid even for not very small @xmath2 .",
    "for example , for @xmath16 the ratio @xmath17 is different from @xmath18 by only one part in a thousand @xcite .",
    "a completely different approach was put forward by kollmann , capel and bountis @xcite who regarded eq.([nls_0 ] ) as the continuous limit of a discrete nls equation which they studied by means of the fixed point analysis and the melnikov - function method . in particular",
    ", the lower boundary was obtained from the tangential intersection of the invariant manifolds of a hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "a remarkable accuracy of kaup and newell s linear law detected in @xcite as well as conclusions of their own melnikov - function analysis prompted the authors of @xcite to suggest that the relation @xmath19 can be _ exact _ , at least for sufficiently small @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of the present note is to demonstrate that this relation is , in fact , _ not _ exact , and the actual reason why it appears to be so accurate for small @xmath2 is simply because the coefficient of the next term in the expansion of @xmath4 in powers of @xmath2 is _",
    "anomalously small_. we do this by reconstructing the two solitons in the vicinity of the lower boundary of their existence domain by means of a singular ( rather than regular ) perturbation expansion .",
    "this novel expansion constitutes the main technical achievement of our work ; its scope of applicability is obviously much wider than just the damped - driven nls equation ( [ nls_0 ] ) .",
    "the reason why the regular expansion is not adequate near the solitons existence boundary is quite simple .",
    "the point is that the regular expansion is based on the assumption that solutions can be continued along rays @xmath20 ( @xmath21 . ) but since the boundary is not _",
    "exactly _ a straight line @xmath22 ( as will be shown below , it slowly recedes upwards from this straight line ) , the ray @xmath23 with @xmath24 slightly above @xmath25 will hit the boundary at some small @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the regular expansion fails to continue the solution beyond @xmath27 .",
    "in the singular expansion , on the other hand , the solution is continued along a curve whose shape is calculated simultaneously with finding perturbative corrections to the solution itself . in this way the existence boundary can be found to any desirable accuracy .",
    "( in this paper we restrict ourselves to terms @xmath28 . )",
    "this idea should remain applicable to other perturbed soliton - bearing equations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start by discussing the regular asymptotic expansion as @xmath0 and @xmath29 ( section [ regular ] ) .",
    "the procedure is similar to the one in @xcite ; the only difference is that since we now deal with solutions decaying at infinities ( @xmath30 ) rather than periodic as in @xcite , we will be able to find perturbative corrections in closed form . in section",
    "[ singular ] we explain why the perturbation series for @xmath31 breaks down as @xmath0 approaches the turning point , and replace it by a singular expansion .",
    "this allows us to find the next terms in the expansion of @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting asymptotic formula is compared then with the threshold @xmath4 obtained in a high - precision numerical analysis of eq.([stat_nls ] ) for several values of @xmath2 .",
    "next , after we have achieved an understanding of why the regular expansion fails and how it can be cured near the existence threshold , a natural step is to try to develop a unified expansion which would be equally applicable near and far from the threshold .",
    "this is done in section [ unified ] .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in section [ conclusions ] followed by a brief summary of our results .",
    "by making a substitution @xmath32 eq.([nls_0 ] ) can be reduced to an autonomous equation @xmath33 we will be interested in time - independent solutions of eq.([nls ] ) ; these satisfy the stationary equation @xmath34 with the boundary conditions @xmath35    we start with developing a regular perturbation expansion away from the turning point . as the authors of @xcite , we assume that we are approaching the origin on the ( @xmath36)-plane along a straight line @xmath20 where @xmath24 is a proportionality coefficient . letting    [ reg ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 is some constant phase that can be conveniently chosen at a later stage , we expand @xmath39    and substitute into eq.([stat_nls ] ) .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath40 gives the unperturbed stationary nls equation with a well - known soliton solution @xmath41 here @xmath42 is a free parameter .",
    "next , at the order @xmath43 one gets @xmath44 where the hermitean operator @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the @xmath47 identity matrix . in order for the equation ( [ mat ] ) to be solvable in the class of bounded functions , its right - hand side needs to be orthogonal to the vector @xmath48 , the eigenfunction of the operator @xmath49 associated with the zero eigenvalue .",
    "( this zero eigenvalue results from the u(1 ) phase - invariance of the unperturbed nls equation . )",
    "the orthogonality gives a relation between @xmath50 and @xmath42 , @xmath51 implying that only one of the two parameters ( say , @xmath42 ) can be chosen freely .",
    "it does not matter what exactly we choose for @xmath42 ; the net phase of the leading - order approximation is @xmath52 and this is fixed by eq.([rela ] ) .",
    "the meaning of this relation is straightforward . for @xmath53 , the nls equation",
    "has a family of soliton solutions , @xmath54 , with @xmath52 arbitrary .",
    "however , if we want to continue the solution along the line @xmath55 , the unperturbed solution that we need to start with has the phase given by eq.([rela ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to take @xmath56 ; this makes the linear operator ( [ h1 ] ) diagonal .",
    "( the other diagonal choice @xmath57 is also acceptable but somewhat less convenient in the present context . )",
    "the constant phase @xmath50 is then determined by @xmath58 in fact , there are two values of @xmath50 defined by this equation , one positive and one negative .",
    "the positive @xmath59 corresponds to the soliton @xmath60 and the negative @xmath61 defines the soliton @xmath62 .",
    "since the left - hand side can not exceed 1 , the right - hand side gives the well - known formula for the lower boundary of the domain of existence of the two solitons : @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "( in the next section we will obtain a more precise formula for this threshold . )",
    "now for @xmath64 the equations ( [ mat ] ) become @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the standard schrdinger operators with familiar spectral properties : @xmath69 the operator @xmath68 is invertible on even functions ; in particular , @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 hence eq.([m2 ] ) is readily solved : @xmath73 the condition ( [ alpha ] ) being in place , eq.([m1 ] ) is solved as well :    [ u1 ] @xmath74 where @xmath75    and @xmath76 is an arbitrary constant which is to be fixed at higher orders of the expansion . hence we proceed to @xmath77 to find @xmath78 equation ( [ m3 ] ) is solvable if its right - hand side is orthogonal to @xmath79 . substituting from ( [ v_1])-([ua ] ) , this condition fixes the constant @xmath76 : @xmath80 where we have used eqs.([prop1]-[prop2 ] ) .",
    "( here we have written @xmath81 for @xmath76 so as to emphasize that this is now a fixed number ; this number will reappear in the singular expansion below . )",
    "eq.([m3 ] ) is now solved in the form @xmath82 the constant @xmath83 is to be fixed at the @xmath84-level , where we obtain the equation @xmath85 the solvability condition for eq.([m5 ] ) gives us @xmath83 : @xmath86    so far our treatment followed the lines of terrones _",
    "et al _ @xcite ;",
    "the only difference is that our @xmath87 are given by explicit formulas . using ( [ a ] ) in ( [ at ] ) and integrating numerically ,",
    "we identify the constant @xmath81 which completes the determination of the first - order corrections : @xmath88 .",
    "let us now send @xmath89 .",
    "the formula ( [ u1 ] ) for @xmath90 is not affected and the expression ( [ at ] ) for @xmath76 remains valid as well .",
    "therefore , the solvability of eq.([m3 ] ) is ensured and @xmath91 can be written in the form ( [ m7 ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath83 is expected to be identifiable from eq.([b ] ) . however , for @xmath92 we have @xmath93 and so this formula gives @xmath94 unless @xmath95 ( here we have used that @xmath96 as @xmath93 . ) in general the condition ( [ condi ] ) is _ not _ in place , and therefore the regular expansion blows up .",
    "the reason for the breaking down of the expansion is that it was implicitly assumed in eq.([uvexpa ] ) that @xmath97 whereas in the actual fact , in the limit @xmath92 we have @xmath96 .",
    "let us now explicitly take this fact into account by writing    [ sing ] @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "we also expand @xmath24 : @xmath100    ( thus we have fixed @xmath56 and @xmath101 straight away . ) substituting into ( [ stat_nls ] ) , the first order in @xmath2 yields eq.([m1 ] ) where one should only replace @xmath102 .",
    "its solution is given by the same eq.([u1 ] ) as before , with @xmath76 an undetermined constant . at the order @xmath103",
    "we obtain @xmath104 and hence @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "indeed , substituting @xmath111 from ( [ ua ] ) and @xmath107 from ( [ v_2 ] ) , eq.([condi2 ] ) reduces to a quadratic equation @xmath112 where after some algebra the coefficients are found to be @xmath113 and @xmath114 \\ } dx .",

    "another observation is that the coefficient @xmath119 coincides with the constant @xmath81 [ eq.([at ] ) ] obtained in the regular expansion . to see",
    "that , one only needs to use the identity ( [ identity ] ) once again .    the roots of eq.([quadra ] ) are given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 hence , if @xmath122 , eq.([stat_nls ] ) has two solutions @xmath123 which are only different in the coefficients @xmath124 . if @xmath125 , there are no solutions at all .",
    "the value @xmath126 is therefore the turning point .",
    "doing numerically the integral in ( [ q ] ) we find @xmath127 . recalling that @xmath119 coincides with eq.([at ] ) ,",
    "@xmath128 , eq.([h20 ] ) gives @xmath129 .",
    "finally , the coefficient @xmath76 corresponding to the turning point coincides with the  far from the turning point \" value , eq.([at ] ) : @xmath130 .",
    "it is worth noting here that if @xmath131 , eq.([condi2 ] ) is formally coincident with eq.([condi ] ) .",
    "this does not mean , however , that soliton solutions exist for @xmath131 , and that these solutions can be found by regular expansions ( [ reg ] ) .",
    "the difference is that in eq.([condi ] ) the function @xmath90 has the coefficient @xmath76 which has already been fixed by eq.([at ] ) , whereas eq.([condi2 ] ) is an equation for _ unknown _ @xmath76 .",
    "next , how close to @xmath132 does the regular expansion stop working and has to be replaced by the singular one ? for @xmath133 eq.([alpha ] ) produces @xmath134 and so the regular expansion for @xmath123 reads @xmath135 with @xmath136 as in ( [ a ] ) , whereas the correct , singular expansion is @xmath137 where @xmath124 are given by eq.([apm ] ) . comparing ( [ wrong ] ) to ( [ right ] ) , one concludes that the difference between the regular and singular expansions is negligible provided @xmath138 . on the contrary , for",
    "@xmath139 the difference can not be ignored .",
    "we close this section by comparing our asymptotic approximation for @xmath4 with results of the high - accuracy numerical solution of eq.([stat_nls ] ) . here",
    "we employed a fourth - order newtonian algorithm , with the stepsize @xmath140 and residual @xmath141 .",
    "eq.([stat_nls ] ) was solved on a half - interval @xmath142 .",
    "we would decrease @xmath0 in increments of @xmath143 until iterations have ceased to converge ; after that we would repeat the computations on a condensed grid and extended interval . as a result",
    "we were able to obtain the threshold @xmath132 accurate to ten digits after the decimal point .",
    "fig.1 shows the difference between the numerically found values of @xmath132 and ( a ) kaup and newell s linear law @xmath144 , and ( b ) the refined asymptotic expansion @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "the latter expansion is indeed seen to provide a more accurate approximation for the threshold .",
    "the singular expansion of the previous section was designed as a continuation and generalization of the regular expansion and presented in the form that allows for a straightforward comparison with the latter .",
    "a natural step now is to try to develop a unified approach which would be valid both near and far from the turning point .",
    "such a unified formalism could provide an additional insight into the structure of solutions and have some technical advantages .",
    "the unification is achieved if one notices that the role of the coefficients @xmath147 is simply to renormalize the constant phase of the leading - order approximation @xmath148 .",
    "consequently , instead of adding homogeneous solutions @xmath149 , @xmath150 at each order of @xmath2 we can expand @xmath50 : @xmath151 ( this observation belongs to d. e. pelinovsky . ) multiplying eq.([stat_nls ] ) through by @xmath152 : @xmath153 and substituting eqs.([hexp ] ) , ( [ exp_alpha ] ) and ( [ uvexpa ] ) with @xmath154 and @xmath155 , we get , at the order @xmath2 : @xmath156 with @xmath136 as in eq.([a ] ) . for any @xmath157 eq.([halpha ] ) gives the initial slope of the curve @xmath158 along which we want to continue our solution .",

    "one of these ( say , @xmath163 ) can be chosen freely ; then eq.([hal1 ] ) fixes the other .",

    "note that in the new formalism the corrections in the phase of @xmath169 are uncoupled from the rest of the expansion .",
    "the advantage of this is that the correction @xmath164 ( @xmath170 in the previous notation ) arises at the order @xmath103 and not at @xmath171 as before ; the correction @xmath172 ( previously known as @xmath83 ) arises at @xmath173 and not at @xmath77 , and so forth . as a result , @xmath111 does not contain the unknown @xmath164 ( @xmath76 ) ; the correction @xmath107 depends on @xmath164 only linearly ( not quadratically as before ) , and so the resulting equation for @xmath164 is manifestly quadratic .",

    "* 1 . * in the undamped case ( @xmath174 ) for any @xmath175 eq.([stat_nls ] ) has two explicit solutions @xcite : @xmath176    where @xmath177 is the asymptotic value of @xmath178 as @xmath179 ; the parameter @xmath180 is defined by inverting the relation @xmath181 and @xmath182 is given by @xmath183    for the given value of @xmath0 the @xmath60 branch merges with @xmath62 at some @xmath184 [ defined , approximately , by @xmath185 .",
    "if @xmath0 is small then this @xmath184 is also small , so that the point of the merger is very close to the @xmath0-axis and hence intuitively one could expect solutions at this point to be close to the undamped solitons ( [ g=0 ] ) .",
    "however , it is not quite obvious how this proximity can be reconciled with the fact that the two real solutions ( [ g=0 ] ) are rather far from each other .",
    "a related question concerns the shape of the @xmath60 and @xmath62 solitons . in the undamped case [ eq.([g=0 ] ) ] the real function @xmath60 has a hump and @xmath62 has a dip .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the hump respectively the dip persist in real parts of @xmath60 respectively @xmath62 solitons for @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "again , it is intuitively not quite obvious how the hump can transform into dip as the two branches merge .",
    "shall this transformation proceed via the flat state ?",
    "the behaviour of solutions for small @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( in particular , near the turning point ) can be clarified by invoking the asymptotic expansions ( [ reg ] ) and ( [ sing ] ) . for the sake of illustration",
    ", we have also computed the two solitons numerically for a fixed small @xmath2 ( @xmath187 ) and varying @xmath0 ; results are shown in fig.2 . in agreement with eq.([reg ] ) , for not very small @xmath0 ( @xmath188 ) the imaginary parts of the solitons are seen to be almost zero [ dashed lines in fig.2(b ) ] while the real parts change slowly with the variation of @xmath0 .",
    "for these @xmath0 the pair of real solutions ( [ g=0 ] ) does indeed provide a good approximation for the corresponding @xmath123 with @xmath187 .",
    "however , as @xmath0 goes down , the real parts start changing ( decreasing in magnitude ) more vigorously while the imaginary parts are not small any longer ; consequently , the approximation deteriorates . near the turning point",
    "the real parts of both solitons become much smaller than their imaginary parts [ see fig .",

    "this justifies our usage of the notations @xmath60 and @xmath62 for @xmath190 .",
    "finally , in a very near vicinity of the existence threshold @xmath191 , the hump of the real part quickly transforms into the dip [ fig.2(c ) ] .",
    "this rapid change near the turning point can be easily understood in terms of the singular expansion ( [ sing ] ) .",
    "when @xmath192 is close to @xmath193 , we can define a small @xmath194 by writing @xmath195 the corresponding @xmath76 s in eq.([ua ] ) are then given by @xmath196 recalling that to the leading order in @xmath2 it is only this coefficient @xmath76 that determines the dependence of solutions on @xmath0 , eq.([aeps ] ) gives the rate of change of their real parts : @xmath197 as @xmath198 , the rate of change becomes infinitely large .",
    "away from the neighbourhood of the turning point , in the region of the applicability of the regular expansion ( [ reg ] ) , the rate of the transformation of the solitons @xmath199 is given by @xmath200 similarly to eq.([uh ] ) , this shows that as @xmath201 , the two solitons transform increasingly fast .",
    "thus if we want to use the two real solitons ( [ g=0 ] ) as approximations for their respective ( @xmath202)-counterparts , we should keep in mind that this approximation is valid only far away from the turning point @xmath184 .",
    "since for small @xmath0 the turning point is close to the @xmath0-axis ( i.e. @xmath203 is also small ) , the validity of the approximation will be restricted to _ very _ small @xmath2 : @xmath204 .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize the main points of this work .    *",

    "<S> it has been known for some time that solitons of the externally driven , damped nonlinear schrdinger equation can only exist if the driver s strength , @xmath0 , exceeds approximately @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dissipation coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> although this perturbative result was expected to be correct only to the leading order in @xmath2 , recent studies have demonstrated that the formula @xmath3 gives a remarkably accurate description of the soliton s existence threshold prompting suggestions that it is , in fact , _ </S>",
    "<S> exact_. in this note we evaluate the next order in the expansion of @xmath4 showing that the actual reason for this phenomenon is simply that the next - order coefficient is anomalously small : @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on a singular perturbation expansion of the soliton near the turning point ; it allows to evaluate @xmath4 to all orders in @xmath2 and can be easily reformulated for other perturbed soliton equations .    2 </S>"
