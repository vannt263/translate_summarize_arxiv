    "an important prediction of quantum theory is the existence of irreducible fluctuations of electromagnetic fields even in vacuum , that is in the thermodynamical equilibrium state with a zero temperature .",
    "these fluctuations have a number of observable consequences in microscopic physics for example in atomic physics the van der waals force between atoms in vacuum .",
    "vacuum fluctuations also have observable mechanical effects in macroscopic physics and the archetype of these effects is the casimir force between two mirrors at rest in vacuum .",
    "this force was predicted by h. casimir in 1948 @xcite and soon observed in different experiments which confirmed its existence @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have reached a good precision , in the % range , which makes possible an accurate comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental observations @xcite .",
    "such a comparison is important for at least two reasons .",
    "on one hand , the casimir force is a mechanical consequence of vacuum fluctuations which raise a serious challenge at the frontier of quantum theory with the physics of gravitation ; it is therefore important to test this prediction with the greatest care and accuracy . on the other hand",
    ", several experiments are searching for hypothetical new forces predicted by the models of unification of fundamental forces and the main target of these experiments is now the distance range between the nanometer and millimeter ; in this distance range , the casimir force is the dominant interaction between neutral objects so that these experiments are essentially limited by the accuracy in the knowledge of the casimir force .",
    "references on these topics as well as further discussions of the motivations for studying the casimir force may be found in @xcite .",
    "casimir considered an ideal configuration with two perfectly reflecting mirrors in vacuum .",
    "but the experiments are performed with real reflectors , for example metallic mirrors which show perfect reflection only at frequencies below the plasma frequency characterizing the metal .",
    "accounting for imperfect reflection and its frequency dependence is thus essential for obtaining a reliable theoretical expectation of the casimir force in a real situation .",
    "this is also true for other corrections to the ideal casimir formula associated with the experimental configuration : experiments are performed at room temperature , with the effect of thermal fluctuations superimposed to that of vacuum fluctuations ; in most experiments , the force is measured between a plane and a sphere , and not between two parallel planes ; also , the surface state of the plates , in particular their roughness , should affect the force . here , we will focus our attention on the evaluation of the casimir force between two plane mirrors with arbitrary frequency dependent reflection amplitudes and ignore the other corrections associated with the effect of a non zero temperature or a non plane geometry .    the consideration of real mirrors is important not only for the analysis of experiments but also from a conceptual point of view .",
    "real mirrors are certainly transparent at the limit of high frequencies and this allows one to dispose of the divergences associated with the infiniteness of vacuum energy .",
    "this point was already alluded to in casimir s papers and an important step in this direction was the lifshitz theory of the casimir force between two dielectric bulks @xcite . here",
    "we will use the general expression of the casimir force obtained for two plane mirrors characterized by arbitrary frequency dependent reflection amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this expression is directly associated with an interpretation of the force as resulting from the radiation pressure exerted by vacuum fluctuations upon the two mirrors which form a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the balance between repulsive and attractive contributions associated with resonant and antiresonant frequencies gives the net casimir force .",
    "this method always leads to a finite result as a consequence of the causality properties and high - frequency transparency obeyed by any real mirror .",
    "in other words , the properties of real mirrors are sufficient to obtain a regular expression of the casimir force , in spite of the infiniteness of vacuum energy .    in the next section",
    ", we will first recall this general expression of the casimir force between real mirrors and briefly discuss its application to theory - experiment comparison .",
    "we will then focus our attention on the simplest model of metallic mirrors , namely bulk mirrors with the optical response of metals described by the plasma model .",
    "this model is not sufficient for an accurate evaluation of the casimir force but its simplicity allows one to discuss qualitatively a lot of interesting physical features . in particular",
    ", we will discuss the analogies and differences between the results obtained with this model for the casimir force between macroscopic mirrors and for the casimir - polder force between two atoms in vacuum . in both cases ,",
    "simple power laws are obtained at the limits of long and short distances .",
    "the indices of these power laws are different in the two cases but the crossovers between short and long - distance laws present profound analogies .",
    "let us briefly mention the convention we usually use to name the different interaction ranges ( there is no overall accepted denomination yet ) . while we name the long range interaction between atoms usually casimir - polder force , as casimir and polder were the first to derive the correct expression in the retarded intercation limit , we call the short distance limit of the interaction between atomic bodies the van der waals or london interaction , after the two physicists the first of whom predicted phenomenologically while the second derived quantum mechanically the correct interaction law .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the casimir force at short distances can be understood as the london interaction between the elementary excitations of both scatterers , that is the surface plasmons of the two bulk mirrors .",
    "these surface plasmons are oscillating electromagnetic fields , strongly localized at the surface of a metal ( evanescent waves ) and associated with the collective motion of electrons .    before entering this discussion",
    ", we may emphasize that the existence of vacuum fluctuations alters the physical conception of empty space  : in contrast to classical physics , quantum theory forces us to consider vacuum as permanently filled by field fluctuations having observable effects .",
    "van der waals and casimir forces are nothing but the effects of vacuum radiation pressure on microscopic or macroscopic objects at rest .",
    "vacuum radiation pressure also induces dynamical effects for objects moving in vacuum and these effects are directly connected to the problem of relativity of motion .",
    "discussions of these dynamical effects and references may be found in @xcite .",
    "we now come to a more precise discussion of the casimir force .",
    "casimir calculated this force in a geometrical configuration where two plane mirrors are placed a distance @xmath0 apart from each other , parallel to each other , the area @xmath1 of the mirrors being much larger than the squared distance @xmath2 .",
    "considering the ideal case of perfectly reflecting mirrors casimir obtained the following expression for the force @xmath3 we have chosen the sign convention found in most papers on casimir force with a positive value of @xmath4 corresponding to an attraction , that is also a negative pressure .",
    "this ideal casimir formula only depends on geometrical quantities @xmath1 and @xmath0 and on two fundamental constants , the speed of light @xmath5 and planck constant @xmath6 .",
    "this remarkable universal feature corresponds to the fact that the optical response of perfect mirrors is saturated  : mirrors can not reflect more than 100 % of the incoming light , whatever their atomic constitution may be .",
    "this makes an important difference between ideal casimir forces and the van der waals forces , discussed below , which depend on atomic polarizabilities .",
    "now experiments are performed with metallic mirrors which do not reflect all field frequencies perfectly .",
    "this has certainly to be taken into account in the comparison between theoretical estimations and experimental measurements .",
    "this also entails that the casimir force between real mirrors depends on the atomic structure constants which determine the optical properties of the latter .    imperfectly reflecting mirrors",
    "will be described by scattering amplitudes which depend on the frequency , wavevector and polarization while obeying general properties of stability , high - frequency transparency and causality .",
    "the two mirrors form a fabry - perot cavity with the consequences well - known in classical or quantum optics  : the energy density of the intracavity field is increased for the resonant frequency components whereas it is decreased for the non resonant ones .",
    "the casimir force is but the result of the balance between the radiation pressure of the resonant and non resonant modes which push the mirrors respectively towards the outer and inner sides of the cavity @xcite .",
    "this balance includes not only the contributions of ordinary waves propagating freely outside the cavity but also that of evanescent waves .",
    "these two sectors of ordinary and evanescent waves are directly connected by analyticity properties of the scattering amplitudes ( see a more precise discussion below ) .",
    "the casimir force may then be written as an integral over frequencies @xmath7 , transverse wavevectors @xmath8 and a sum over polarizations @xmath9 of the vacuum field modes . due to the analycity properties , the integral",
    "may be written also over imaginary frequencies @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 real ) @xmath12 } { 1-\\rho _ { { \\bf k}}^{p}\\left [ i\\xi \\right ] } \\label{force }",

    "the fraction @xmath16 is the sum of similar factors over the number of round trips inside the fabry - perot cavity @xmath17 in other words , @xmath13 is the ` open loop function ' associated with the cavity while @xmath16 is the ` closed loop function ' taking into account the feedback ; all these quantities are evaluated at imaginary frequencies through an analytical prolongation from their values at real frequencies",
    ".    expression ( [ force ] ) holds for dissipative mirrors as well as for non dissipative ones @xcite .",
    "it is regular for any frequency dependence of the reflection amplitudes obeying natural physical conditions  : causality of the amplitudes and high - frequency transparency for each mirror , stability of the closed loop function associated with the fabry - perot cavity",
    ". expression ( [ force ] ) tends towards the ideal casimir formula ( [ fcasimir ] ) as soon as the mirrors are nearly perfect for the modes contributing to the integral .",
    "incidentally , these results show that the casimir force between two plane mirrors can be evaluated without any renormalization technique  : as guessed by casimir in his original paper , the properties of real mirrors themselves are sufficient to enforce regularity of the casimir force .    the condition under which the ideal casimir result is approached will be specified below for bulk mirrors described by the plasma model .",
    "more generally , the reduction of the casimir force ( [ force ] ) with respect to the ideal formula ( [ fcasimir ] ) due to the imperfect reflection of mirrors is described by a factor @xmath18    we may proceed analogously for discussing the casimir energy between real mirrors , evaluated by integrating the force @xmath19 for the energy , we use the standard convention of thermodynamics , with a negative value corresponding to a binding energy .",

    ", the force has been measured between a sphere and a plane and not between two plane parallel mirrors .",
    "the casimir force in this geometry is estimated from the proximity force approximation @xcite which amounts to integrate the contributions of the various inter - plate distances as if they were independent .",
    "although the accuracy of this approximation remains to be mastered , it is usually thought to give a reliable approximation .",
    "the force in the sphere - plane geometry is then given by the radius @xmath23 of the sphere and by the casimir energy as evaluated in the plane - plane configuration for the distance @xmath0 of closest approach @xmath24 using the results ( [ ecasimir]-[etae ] ) obtained in the plane - plane geometry , one finally obtains the casimir force in the sphere - plane geometry @xmath25 this theoretical expression is used for comparison with recent precise measurements of the force @xcite .",
    "it accounts for the effects of imperfect reflection and plane - sphere geometry which have a significant impact on the value of the casimir force .",
    "this is not the case for the effects of thermal fluctuations and surface roughness which only have a marginal influence ( @xmath26 ) in the same experiments . as a consequence , the good agreement ( @xmath27 ) obtained in the theory - experiment comparison",
    "can be considered as a confirmation of the existence and properties of the casimir force as well as a test of the corrections associated with imperfect reflection and plane - sphere geometry .",
    "we want to emphasize that a precise description of the optical response of the mirrors is necessary to reach an accurate evaluation of the effect of imperfect reflection .",
    "if an accuracy of the order of 1% is aimed at , this description should take into account the knowledge of optical data of the metals on a wide frequency range @xcite .",
    "in particular , the plasma model is not sufficient for such an accurate evaluation . as announced in the introduction however",
    ", we will use this simple model in the following to get interesting results about the comparison of casimir and casimir - polder forces .",
    "for bulk mirrors , the reflection amplitudes are simply given by the fresnel laws corresponding to the vacuum / metal interface with different expressions for the two polarizations te and tm @xmath28 @xmath29 is the dielectric function of the metal given by the plasma model @xmath30 = 1 + \\frac{\\omega_{\\rm p}^2}{\\xi ^2 } \\qquad , \\qquad \\lambda _ { \\rm p}=\\frac{2\\pi c}{\\omega _",

    "these expressions are well known but their analyticity properties deserve a special attention in the context of the present discussion .",
    "causality entails that the reflection amplitudes are analytical functions of the frequency in the ` physical domain ' defined in the complex plane by a positive real part for @xmath11 @xcite @xmath35 analyticity has to be understood with @xmath8 and @xmath9 fixed , the branch of the square roots being taken so that @xmath36 the sectors of ordinary and evanescent waves lie on the boundary of this domain  : they indeed correspond to real frequencies @xmath7 , that is also to purely imaginary values for @xmath11 .",
    "they are distinguished by the values of @xmath33 which are purely imaginary for ordinary waves ( @xmath37 ) , but real for evanescent waves ( @xmath38 ) . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath33 is just the inverse of the penetration length in vacuum of waves coming from the refracting medium .",
    "as already alluded to , analyticity also connects these two sectors to the sector of imaginary frequencies ( @xmath11 real ) .",
    "precisely , expressions of the reflection amplitudes or of the loop functions in this sector are obtained from similar expressions written for real frequencies through an analytical continuation .",
    "this property was in fact used to write the force ( [ force ] ) and energy ( [ energy ] ) as integrals over imaginary frequencies @xcite .",
    "note in particular that the exponential factor @xmath39 appearing in the loop function @xmath13 describes the frustration of total reflection on each vacuum / metal interface due to the evanescent propagation of the field through the length @xmath0 of the cavity .",
    "this explains why the radiation pressure of vacuum modes is not identical on the internal and external sides of each mirror and , therefore , why the casimir force has finally a non null value .",
    "it is also worth discussing in more details the modulus of the reflection amplitude which is expected to be smaller than unity as a consequence of unitarity of the scattering on a mirror @xmath40 this property is certainly true in the sector of ordinary waves where it is effectively a direct consequence of unitarity , for lossy as well as lossless mirrors @xcite .",
    "it is easily seen ( [ reflampl ] ) that it is also true in the sector of imaginary frequencies where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath29 are real and positive .",
    "but the case of evanescent waves requires a closer examination and the result of this examination depends on the polarization .    for te waves , it follows from ( [ kappabranch ] ) that ( [ passiv ] ) holds also in the evanescent sector .",
    "it is then a consequence of the phragmn - lindelf theorem @xcite that ( [ passiv ] ) is true on the whole physical domain ( [ physicaldomain ] ) .",
    "then the open loop function @xmath13 also has its modulus smaller than unity in this domain which ensures stability of the closed loop gain @xmath16 .",
    "this stability means that neither the mirrors forming the cavity nor the vacuum fields enclosed in this cavity have the ability to sustain the oscillation which would be associated with a pole of @xmath16 in the physical domain @xcite . for tm waves ,",
    "this stability property is also true and no self - sustained oscillation of the fabry - perot cavity occurs .",
    "however , ( [ passiv ] ) does not hold in the evanescent sector since the reflection amplitudes reach large values corresponding to the existence of surface plasmon resonances ( see a more precise discussion below ) .",
    "this means that the closed loop amplitude is still stable although the open loop amplitude has a modulus larger than unity . in more mathematical terms , the oscillation condition @xmath41 , which corresponds to a pole of the closed loop function @xmath16 , is never met in the physical domain ( [ physicaldomain ] ) although @xmath42 may exceed unity in this domain .",
    "this discussion can be made more precise for bulk mirrors described by the plasma model . to this aim ,",
    "we first consider reflection of tm waves on one such mirror . the corresponding reflection amplitude @xmath43 given by ( [ reflampl ] )",
    "is seen to diverge when @xmath44 , which defines the surface plasmon resonance condition @xcite . with the plasma model",
    ", this condition can be solved as an expression for the frequency in terms of the transverse wavevector , differing by a mere sign , corresponds to a vanishing reflection amplitude and defines the brewster frequency with the following expression @xmath45 . ]",
    "@xmath46 the surface plasmon frequency @xmath47 is real and lies on the boundary @xmath48 of the physical domain ( [ physicaldomain ] ) .",
    "when dissipation is taken into account , for example by considering the drude model instead of the plasma model , the pole of the closed loop amplitude is pushed from this boundary @xmath48 into the unphysical domain @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that the divergence encountered with the plasma model is transformed into a resonance . in the vicinity of this resonance ,",
    "the modulus @xmath50 of the reflection amplitude exceeds unity but the closed loop function remains stable since its pole lies outside the physical domain .",
    "when two mirrors are considered , their surface plasmons are coupled by evanescent propagation through the cavity so that their frequencies are displaced .",
    "their displacement can be seen as responsible for the interaction between the two mirrors @xcite",
    ". this approach will be discussed in more detail below since it leads to an interesting interpretation of the casimir force at short distances .",
    "using the simple mirror model of the preceding section , we now discuss the relation between the effect of imperfect reflection and the explored distance range .",
    "the evaluation of the reduction factor ( [ etaf ] ) for bulk mirrors described by the plasma model has been presented in @xcite . in this simple case , the reduced force @xmath51 is a function of a single parameter , namely the reduced distance @xmath52 .",
    "we draw this function on figure [ figplasmamodel ] .     as a function of the reduced distance @xmath52  : @xmath51 goes to unity at large distances whereas it varies linearly with @xmath52 at short distances ; the latter behaviour is represented by the dashed line.,width=226 ]    we first note that the factor @xmath51 gets close to unity at large distances @xmath53 this corresponds to a well known interpretation  : large distances @xmath54 correspond to low frequencies @xmath55 for which metallic mirrors described by the plasma model are nearly perfect reflectors ; this is why the ideal casimir formula ( [ fcasimir ] ) is a very good approximation of the real force ( [ force ] ) in this limit .    otherwise , the factor @xmath51 is smaller than unity and describes the reduction of the force due to the imperfect reflection of the metallic mirror at high frequencies . in the limiting case of distances",
    "small with respect to the plasma wavelength , the reduction becomes quite significant since the factor @xmath51 varies linearly with the small factor @xmath56 @xmath57 the dimensionless constant @xmath58 was evaluated numerically in @xcite and it will be given a more detailed interpretation in the following .    at this point",
    ", it is worth comparing the variation with distance of the casimir force with that of the van der waals force between two atoms in vacuum .",
    "casimir and polder @xcite indeed showed that the latter force obeys power laws in the two limits of short and long distances , with the exponent being changed by one unit when going from one limit to the other and the crossover taking place when the interatomic distance @xmath0 crosses the typical atomic wavelength @xmath59 .",
    "the same behaviours are also observed for the casimir force between two metallic mirrors with the plasma wavelength @xmath60 playing the role of @xmath59 .",
    "since this comparison allows one to get interesting insight on the casimir force , we briefly recall the results known for the casimir - polder force in the next section and then discuss the analogies and differences between both cases .",
    "in the present section we remind a few interesting results about the van der waals force between two atoms .",

    "is written for two identical atoms ; otherwise , @xmath64 should be replaced by the product of the polarizabilities of the two atoms . ]",
    "the polarizability is written here in the dissipation free approximation and it depends on the energy @xmath65 of the @xmath66th atomic state measured with respect to the ground state and on a coefficient @xmath67 proportional to the square modulus of the dipole matrix element associated with the transition . in the sequel of the paper , we discuss the profound analogies as well as a few significant differences appearing in the comparison of expression ( [ casimirpolder ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we want first to stress a fundamental analogy related to the very significance of long - range interactions such as casimir - polder or casimir effects .",
    "feinberg and sucher @xcite have written a still more general expression of the casimir - polder energy with magnetic polarizabilities taken into account besides the electric polarizabilities which appear in ( [ casimirpolder ] ) . since magnetic terms are smaller than electric ones , we ignore them here but however refer to their paper for a very general discussion of long - range interactions which decrease as power laws of the distance .",
    "this makes an important difference with molecular interactions which decrease as exponential laws and , for this reason , dominate at typical atomic distances .",
    "an interesting fact is that long range interactions , in contrast to molecular interactions , may be deduced from the scattering amplitudes evaluated for the two scatterers separately . in more formal words , the two - centers scattering amplitudes may be written in terms of the one - center scattering amplitudes evaluated on shell for the photons and of free field propagation factors .",
    "for example , the casimir - polder energy ( [ casimirpolder ] ) between atoms is written in terms of the polarizabilities @xmath63 while the casimir energy ( [ energy ] ) between mirrors is written in terms of the reflection amplitudes @xmath68 . in both cases ,",
    "free field propagation between the two centers is described by the exponential factor @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the momentum transfered on each scattering . in both cases too , the interaction energy can be written equivalently as an integral over real or imaginary frequencies , the equivalence being a consequence of causality properties .",
    "these fundamental analogies should be appreciated in contrast with some significant differences . in particular , the atoms are point - like scatterers well coupled to the spherical waves centered on them whereas mirrors are plane scatterers which fit the definition of plane waves . hence",
    ", the expression ( [ energy ] ) of the casimir force shows explicitly the summation over transverse wavevectors @xmath8 and polarizations @xmath9 while the field propagation directions and polarizations have been traced over in expression ( [ casimirpolder ] ) of the casimir - polder energy .",
    "it also follows from the point - like character of atoms that their mutual coupling through the field is less efficient than for mirrors . in other words ,",
    "the two atoms form a poor - finesse cavity so that the higher order interferences terms , which play an important role in the fabry - perot cavity , can be disregarded in the two - atoms problem .",
    "this difference is made explicit by expanding the logarithm in ( [ energy ] ) as @xmath71 the lowest - order term in this expansion varies as @xmath72 with distance and thus corresponds to the term present in ( [ casimirpolder ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the higher - order terms appearing in ( [ logexpand ] ) and , therefore , in ( [ energy ] ) are not accounted for in the perturbative expression ( [ casimirpolder ] ) .",
    "we now go one step further in the discussion of ( [ casimirpolder ] ) by considering the large and short distance limits . in the large distance limit where @xmath0 is greater than the wavelengths of the various atomic transitions",
    ", retardation effect plays a dominant role .",
    "this means that the exponential factor @xmath72 restricts significant contributions to the integral ( [ casimirpolder ] ) to low values of @xmath33 for which the polarizability remains nearly equal to its static value @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "hence , the interaction energy is obtained by evaluating a universal integral @xmath74 \\qquad , \\qquad l \\gg \\lambda _ { \\rm a }   \\label{vdwcp}\\\\ & & \\frac{23}{4 } \\equiv \\int_{0}^{\\infty } { \\rm d}u\\ \\left ( u^{4}+2u^{3}+5u^{2}+6u+3\\right ) e^{-2u } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result bears some similarity with the casimir energy evaluated at large distances which depends only on the static value @xmath75 $ ] of reflection amplitudes . in the casimir case",
    ", this value goes to unity and then completely disappears from the ideal casimir formula ( [ ecasimir ] ) . in the casimir - polder case in contrast ,",
    "@xmath73 $ ] determines the global magnitude of the interaction energy .",
    "the difference between the two power laws can be attributed to dimensional arguments with @xmath63 having the dimension of a volume .",
    "we then consider the short distance limit @xmath76 where the retardation effect is negligible .",
    "this means that the exponential factor may be discarded and also entails that the last term in the parenthesis appearing in ( [ casimirpolder ] ) dominates the other ones .",
    "the interaction energy then scales as @xmath77 , a result well known for the van der waals interaction calculated by london with retardation effects ignored @xcite @xmath78 \\qquad , \\qquad l\\ll \\lambda _ { \\rm a } \\label{vdwlondon}\\ ] ] using the expression of the frequency - dependent polarizability ( see [ casimirpolder ] ) and the integral @xmath79 one rewrites the london expression as @xmath80    at this point we may stress that the change of exponent in the power laws is effectively similar in the casimir and casimir - polder cases  : the casimir energy scales as @xmath81 at large distances and @xmath82 at short distances while the casimir - polder energy scales as @xmath83 at large distances and @xmath84 at short distances . keeping in mind that the global change of exponents is explained by dimensional arguments ,",
    "the change of exponent at the crossover is effectively the same . in order to stress this point",

    "we show that this analogy may be pushed one step further , allowing one to give an interesting interpretation of the casimir force at short distances as resulting from the london ( non retarded ) interaction between the elementary excitations in the two scatterers , that is the surface plasmons which live at the interface between each bulk mirror and vacuum @xcite .",
    "in this last section , we study the casimir energy between metallic plates described by the plasma model at the limit of short distances @xmath87 .    to this aim ,",
    "we first show that its expression ( [ energy ] ) can be greatly simplified at this limit .",
    "indeed , values of @xmath33 contributing significantly to the integral correspond to @xmath88 of the order of unity  : large values have their contribution suppressed by the exponential factor @xmath89 while small values correspond to a small measure in the integration over transverse wavevector .",
    "since @xmath87 , this condition also means that @xmath90 .",
    "meanwhile , a non vanishing value of @xmath68 implies @xmath91 , that is also @xmath92 . in these conditions , @xmath33 and @xmath93",
    "are both approximately equal to @xmath94 , the te reflection amplitude is negligible whereas the tm reflection amplitude takes a simple lorentzian form @xmath95 the frequency @xmath96 is the constant value of the surface plasmon frequency @xmath47 obtained by putting the condition @xmath97 in ( [ freqplasmon ] ) .    for a cavity made with two identical mirrors , the open loop function then takes the simple form @xmath98 the poles of the closed loop function , given by the condition @xmath99 , therefore correspond to the frequencies @xmath100 this expression shows how the surface plasmons corresponding to the two mirrors are displaced from their original frequencies @xmath96 due to their coupling through the cavity .",
    "it also provides an interesting interpretation of the casimir interaction energy which can be written from ( [ rhotm ] ) as @xmath101 the casimir energy is nothing but the result of the shift of zero - point energies of the surface plasmons due to their coupling through the cavity field @xcite .",
    "this result has been obtained with retardation effects neglected  : this follows from the assumptions used in the derivation and is also apparent in the fact that the exponential factors depend on the transverse wavevectors but not on the frequencies of the field .",
    "we now conclude by giving an analytical form of this london - like expression of the casimir energy at short distances .",
