    "in string theory there is a problem which can not be resolved inside of the theory : is there an inner structure of the string ?",
    "if the string is some kind of matter then string theory can not be a fundamental theory of everything .",
    "we need to have a theory for the string matter .",
    "if such matter has an elementary structure then we must have a theory for this structure and so on up to infinity .",
    "in fact this is analogous to the well known old problem of the inner structure of electron .",
    "probably the most radical resolution of this problem was suggested by einstein . as",
    "usually his approach is very revolutionary : the electron does not have any material structure , it is a bridge between two asymptotically flat spaces ( a wormhole in the modern language ) .",
    "one can say that this is einstein s paradigm for the fundamental structure of matter .    surprisingly , this point of view is more adaptable to strings then to point particles .",
    "the reason is that it is very difficult to find vacuum wormhole solutions of einstein equations , but string - like solutions arise as very natural objects in _",
    "vacuum 5d kaluza - klein theory_. in this paper we would like to present such solutions and interpret them as string - like objects .",
    "in common case the 5d metric @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) has the following form @xmath9 @xmath10 are the 4d indices . according to the kaluza - klein point of view @xmath11",
    "is the 4d metric ; @xmath12 is the usual electromagnetic potential and @xmath13 is some scalar field .",
    "the 5d einstein vacuum equations are @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the 5d ricci tensor and after the dimensional reduction we have the following 4d equations for the ( electrogravity + scalar field ) theory ( for the reference see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath16 , \\label{sec1 - 2a}\\\\ \\nabla _ \\nu f^{\\mu \\nu } & = & -3 \\frac{\\partial _ \\nu \\phi}{\\phi } f^{\\mu \\nu } , \\label{sec1 - 2b}\\\\ \\box \\phi & = & - \\frac{\\phi^3}{4 } f^{\\alpha \\beta } f_{\\alpha \\beta } .",

    "substituting this ansatz into the 5d einstein vacuum equations gives us @xmath38 @xmath0 is some constant which physical sense will be discussed below ; these equations are derived after substitution the expression for the electric field in the initial einstein s equatons . the 5d @xmath39-einstein s equation ( 4d maxwell equation )",
    "is taken as having the following solution @xmath40 for the determination of the physical sense of the constant @xmath0 let us write the @xmath39-einstein s equation in the following way : @xmath41 the 5d kaluza - klein gravity after the dimensional reduction says us that the maxwell tensor is @xmath42 that allows us to write in our case the electric field as @xmath43 .",
    "eq . with the electric field defined by can be compared with the maxwell s equations in a continuous medium @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an electric displacement and @xmath46 is a dielectric permeability .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "we can say that the magnitude @xmath47 is like to the electric displacement and in this case the dielectric permeability is @xmath48 .",
    "it means that @xmath0 can be taken as the kaluza - klein electric charge because the flux of electric field is @xmath49 .",
    "gives us the following relationship between the kaluza - klein electric and magnetic charges @xmath50 where @xmath51 . from eq .",
    "it is seen that the charges can be parameterized as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "as the relative strengths of the kaluza - klein fields are varied it was found @xcite that the solutions to the metric in eq .",
    "evolve in the following way :    1 .",
    "the solution is _ a regular flux tube_. the throat between the surfaces at @xmath55 is filled with both electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the longitudinal distance between the @xmath55 surfaces increases , and the cross - sectional size does not increase as rapidly as @xmath56 with @xmath57 . essentially , as the magnetic charge",
    "is increased one can think that the @xmath55 surfaces are taken to @xmath58 and the cross section becomes constant .",
    "the radius @xmath59 is defined by the following way @xmath60 .",
    "2 .   @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the solution is _ an infinite flux tube _ filled with constant electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the cross - sectional size of this solution is constant ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "a similar object was derived within the context of 4d dilaton gravity in ref .",
    "3 .   @xmath63 . in this case",
    "we have _ a singular flux tube _ located between two ( + ) and ( - ) electric and magnetic charges located at @xmath64 .",
    "thus the longitudinal size of this object is again finite , but now the cross sectional size decreases as @xmath65 . at @xmath66",
    "this solution has real singularities which we interpret as the locations of the charges .",
    "the evolution of the solution from a regular flux tube , to an infinite flux tube , to a singular flux tube , as the relative magnitude of the charges is varied , is presented in fig ..    most important for us here is the case with @xmath67 ( but @xmath68 ) . from eq .",
    "we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "now we would like to consider the case with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) ( @xmath71 ) . as we see above the case",
    "@xmath72 is the infinite flux tube with ( electric field ) = ( magnetic field ) .",
    "our basic aim is to show that _ every such object with @xmath73 and cross section @xmath74 can be considered as a string - like object_.    to do this we will numerically investigate solutions of eq s - for different @xmath75 s .",
    "the numerical investigations of our system of equations is complicated as it is very insensitive to @xmath76 . in order to avoid this problem",
    "we introduce the following new functions @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a dimensionless radius .",
    "it is necessary to note that when @xmath79 and @xmath80 we have the above - mentioned infinite flux tube .",
    "we have the following equations for these functions @xmath81 the corresponding solutions of these equations with the different @xmath75 are presented in fig s - .",
    "we see that ( at least in the investigated area of @xmath75 ) at the point @xmath82 the function @xmath83 ( here @xmath27 is the point where @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "the most interesting aspect is that @xmath86 does not grow as @xmath56 and consequently _ the flux tube with @xmath76 ( in the region @xmath87 ) can be considered as a string - like object attached to two universes . _ for brevity we will call such objects _ threads_.    it shows us that the necessary conditions for the consideration of our solution as a string - like object is definitely satysfied in the region @xmath87 and outside of this region the cross section will increase and consequently such approach will not be correct .",
    "for example , it is easy to see for the special case when @xmath88 @xcite . in this case",
    "there is the exact solution @xmath89aand immediately we see that @xmath90 ( at @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 , the same is for the others cases with @xmath93 .",
    "it is interesting to note that here we have the change of the 4d metric signature @xcite .",
    "we can also insert this part of solution between two reissner - nordstm black holes @xcite and join the flux tube with each black hole on the event horizon .",
    "for both cases for us is interesting only the part @xmath87 of the solution because here the transversal linear sizes are much less the longitudinal charachteristic length .    here",
    "we would like to investigate the behavior of all functions close to @xmath94 .",
    "we propose the following approximate form of the metric @xmath95 from eq .",
    "we see that @xmath96 now we would like to show that at this point we have @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the ( @xmath100 ) component of the metric is @xmath101 according to eq s , - we see that @xmath102 consequently @xmath103 and @xmath104 \\label{sec3 - 60}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "we see that @xmath105 and consequently @xmath97 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath106 .",
    "in this section we would like to consider the propagation of small perturbations ( gravitational waves ) of the 5d metric along the thread .",
    "it is not too hard to show @xcite that the equations for these perturbations are @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the background",
    "metric and @xmath7 is the metric with the perturbations .",
    "eq . can be simplified in the case of waves with large frequency @xmath109 with gauging @xmath110 let us introduce coordinates @xmath111 , @xmath112 . as mentioned above our thread",
    "approximately looks like a 1-dimensional object with a cross section of order of planck scale @xmath113 and a classical longitudinal length .",
    "this leads to the possibility that the gravitational waves depend only on the time @xmath114 and the longitudinal coordinate @xmath115 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath116 .",
    ". has the following form @xmath117 or @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we see that the second term does not contain derivatives .",
    "it is interesting to compare these equations for the thread with the classical string equations @xmath121 where @xmath122 are the coordinates of the string and @xmath123 are the parameters on the sheet .",
    "we see that the difference is connected with the second term @xmath124 .",
    "this difference between the thread and the string equations has the origin in the inner structure : the thread has a cross section ( @xmath74 ) but the string is a pure 1-dimensional object .",
    "nevertheless , the gravitational objects on the thread can have propagating solutions .",
    "thus 5d kaluza - klein theory has a very interesting solutions which can be considered as a thread between two universes ( see , fig . ) .",
    "the cross section of such objects can be very small @xmath5 , but the longitudinal length can take any value .",
    "this remark gives us grounds to say that we have an unique object : in the transverse direction it is a quantum object , but in the longitudinal direction a classical one .",
    "it gives us the unique possibility to investigate quantum gravity only in one dimension .",
    "for example , a 1-dimensional spacetime foam on the thread and so on .    our thread presented on fig .",
    "looks like a string attached to two @xmath125-branes with the ends acting as sources of electric / magnetic charges in the external universes .",
    "nevertheless there is the difference : strings are located in some external spacetime but our threads do not need such space .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that any space with lorentzian metric can be embedded into some multidimensional spacetime .",
    "our investigation of the small perturbations propagating on the thread show us that the corresponding equations for the gravitational waves are sufficiently close to the classical string equations .",
    "physically this difference appears because the thread has an inner transversal structure whereas the string is a pure 1-dimensional object .",
    "finally , we see in kaluza - klein gravity can exist 1-dimensional objects and the corresponding equations for the gravitational waves propagating on these objects are similar to the corresponding equations .",
    "our investigation shows us that these 1-dimensional objects ( threads in our notations ) have an inner structure in the spirit of einstein s idea that matter should be constructed from `` nothing '' .",
