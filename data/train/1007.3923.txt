    "the chiral unitary approach to hadron dynamics has brought a new perspective to deal with the interaction of hadrons and the nature of some resonant mesonic @xcite and baryonic states @xcite which appear dynamically generated from the interactions and , thus , have a nature quite different to standard @xmath3 states . with some different formulations at the beginning @xcite ,",
    "the more recent work uses the on shell formulation firstly established on the basis of the n / d method in @xcite , where the potential and the t - matrix in momentum space factorize outside the loop function implicit in the bethe salpeter equation in coupled channels that one uses in those approaches .",
    "this is a very practical way to deal with the problem since one renders the coupled integral equations into a set of algebraic equations , paying a small price which is the fine tuning of some subtraction constant appearing in the dispersion relations involved .",
    "the approach is practical and useful , but carries also a handicap which is that one deals with amplitudes in momentum space , and couplings of the dynamically generated resonances to the different channels , and nowhere do wave functions in coordinate space appear in the approach .",
    "for instance , all properties of a resonance are given in terms of the mass and width and its couplings to the different channels , obtained from the residues of the amplitudes at the poles in the complex plane .",
    "any intuition about the wave function of the different channels , its magnitude and extent in space , is lost in the approach as well as the meaning of the resonances and the discrete values obtained for the resonant energies . obviously , these are magnitudes that help to understand the microscopical composition of the dynamically generated states and , hence , a most welcome information . however , this is not all , since the scattering amplitudes do not contain all the information of the wave function .",
    "they reflect the wave function at long distances . for some observables the wave function at small distances",
    "is needed .",
    "this is the case when one studies the response of states to external sources , which require to evaluate form factors , or expectation values of different observables .",
    "the wave functions , whether in momentum space or coordinate space , are then needed . to study couplings of the resonance to local sources the wave function around the origin",
    "is required , but in the study of form factors one needs to know the wave function at all distances .",
    "we provide them both in the present work .",
    "they are already proving very useful to study new systems with three or more particles , when two of them cluster to form one of these dynamically generated resonances @xcite .",
    "the first steps in this direction were done in @xcite in order to understand the x(3872 ) resonance in terms of a molecule of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and their charge conjugates .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath4 component is slightly bound , while the @xmath5 one is bound by about 7 mev .",
    "this has as a consequence that the @xmath4 component stretches up to very large distances , while the @xmath5 one is more confined , and this has important repercussion in the interpretation of observables regarding this resonance .",
    "the work of @xcite provided also an extension of the two channel ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) formalism to a general one with many coupled channels , but all of them bound .",
    "hence , in @xcite one deals with bound states which as a consequence have a discrete spectrum of energies , and the wave function was only evaluated for the eigenstates of the system .",
    "it is most advisable to extend the approach to the case where one has also coupled channels which are open at a certain energy , which is the majority of the cases in the studies done with the chiral unitary approach .",
    "one might think that the problem is formally identical to the one of the bound coupled channels , but , although there are certainly analogies , there are also subtle , and important , differences which call for a detailed study .",
    "the first big difference is that now , one has wave functions , those of the open channels , that extend to infinity , while",
    "the wave functions of the bound channels will remain constrained in space . the wave functions for the open channels will not be finite normalizable , while those of the bound channels with remain finite normalizable .",
    "this problem has been found before and the difficulties of dealing together with bound states and open , unnormalizable states , has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "we have found a way to deal with this problem and answered questions like : what are the magnitudes that matter in this case when it comes to evaluate observables in terms of the wave functions ? what is the meaning of the resonances in this approach , and why the number of resonant energies are finite ?",
    "these are some of the novel questions that one may now ask and which have to be properly addressed .",
    "this is the purpose of the present work .",
    "we shall develop the formalism and then we will apply the results to evaluate the wave functions in the ten coupled channels of the two @xmath0 states obtained in @xcite .",
    "we follow closely the formalism of @xcite adapting it to the case of open channels .",
    "first we will consider the relation between a coupling constant and the wave function in one channel case . in a second step",
    "we will extend the formalism to the case of multiple coupled channels .      as in @xcite , we take a potential @xmath6 in @xmath7-wave as a separable function in momentum space with the modulating factor being a step function , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 indicate the moduli of the three momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a cutoff in momentum space and @xmath14 is the step function . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath15 does not depend on momentum .",
    "it is worth stressing that the use of this simple form is sufficient to develop the formalism and it has the advantage that it leads to the same on shell factorized bethe salpeter equations ( here we shall use their non relativistic lippmann schwinger form ) than in the chiral unitary approach .",

    "in this paper we have developed a formalism to deal with coupled channels in a unitary approach by paying a special attention to constructing the wave functions in the different channels in the case that there are resonances dynamically generated .",
    "the paper generalizes what was found before for only bound coupled channels .",
    "here we have bound and open channels and the formalism is subtly different , since contrary to the case of bound states , where only discrete energies are allowed , here we have a continuous energy variable",
    ". many of the results obtained for bound states do not hold for the resonance states .",
    "one of the things we do is to identify the meaning of a resonance in the coupled channel approach , and it emerges as an approximate bound state of a coupled channel which can decay into the open ones .",
    "the formalism developed is easy , practical and useful .",
    "a separable potential in coordinate space is chosen which leads to an on shell factorization of the bethe salpeter equations ( lippmann schwinger in the nonrelativistic form ) , which allows to convert the coupled channel integral equations into trivial algebraic equations .",
    "the wave functions in momentum space are then found as trivial analytic functions , from where the wave functions in coordinate space can be easily evaluated .",
    "the couplings of the resonance to the different channels are related to the wave function at the origin and interesting relationships between these couplings are obtained .",
    "we also study the issue of couplings of the resonances to states outside the space of the building channels and justify results used before in the literature , setting the limits for their application .",
    "similarly , we also face the issue of final state interaction within the coupled channel formalism and find again a justification for results used in the literature , setting again the limits of applicability .    as an application of the formalism , we tackle the problem of the two @xmath0 and the @xmath225 states dynamically generated in the chiral unitary approach from the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 interaction .",
    "we evaluate the wave functions in coordinate space for the first time , giving an intuitive idea of the wave functions and the spatial distribution of the particles of the different channels .",
    "we have also evaluated the response function of the resonances to an external scalar source , together with the form factors involved .",
    "we envisage practical applications of the formalism in any problem where one has to deal with the interaction of external sources with the dynamically generated resonances . in particular in the building up of multihadron states using iteratively the fixed center approximation to the faddeev equations , where other methods would turn out technically prohibitive .",
