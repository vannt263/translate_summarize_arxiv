    "a hypernucleus is the result of implanting of a hyperon(s ) , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 , in an ordinary nucleus .",
    "spectroscopic studies of hypernuclei can provide information on the hyperon behavior in a nucleus .",
    "one can learn about the hyperon - nucleon interaction , and even the baryon - baryon interaction within the framework of @xmath7(3 ) , from the hypernuclear structure through the effective hyperon - nucleon interaction in a nucleus .",
    "so far , the spectroscopic studies of @xmath3-hypernuclei are in a relatively advanced stage .",
    "the @xmath3 major shell structures , even up to @xmath8y or @xmath9pb , have been clearly observed with high - resolution spectroscopy in the ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) reaction @xcite , which have revealed the @xmath3-single particle nature .",
    "namely , the binding energies of @xmath3 can be well - reproduced by a woods - saxon - type one - body potential @xcite .",
    "in addition , high - resolution ge detectors together with a magnetic spectrometer have successfully observed @xmath12 transitions involving the @xmath3-hypernuclear states split by @xmath13 spin - dependent interactions , such as the spin - orbit and spin - spin forces in several light @xmath3-hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , knowledge about @xmath14 and @xmath4-nucleus interactions is still primitive , although the history of @xmath4-hypernuclear studies is almost comparable to that of @xmath3-hypernuclei . since a strong conversion process of @xmath4 ( @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath13 ) takes place inside a nucleus , the @xmath4-hypernuclear state is expected to be too broad to observe .",
    "the first claim of the observation of a narrow @xmath4-hypernuclear state by the saclay - heidelberg collaboration @xcite thus generated much experimental and theoretical excitement , but was excluded in the later experiment @xcite .",
    "so far , many other experiments have been carried out on different light nuclear targets using the ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) reactions @xcite .",
    "the only @xmath4-hypernuclear bound state has been established in @xmath18he produced by an in - flight ( @xmath16,@xmath19 ) reaction on @xmath20he @xcite , which was first claimed at kek @xcite . the observation of this bound state was predicted with the effect of a strongly isospin - dependent @xmath4-nucleus potential ( lane term ) @xcite .",
    "the existence of the lane term was also suggested in light nuclear systems from the systematic difference between the inclusive ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) spectra @xcite .",
    "all of the other experiments could not find any bound @xmath4-hypernuclear state , and failed to give any significant constraint on the @xmath4-nucleus potential .",
    "no data are available in heavier nuclei of @xmath21@xmath2216 .",
    "one may construct the @xmath4-nucleus folding potential based on the two - body hyperon - nucleon potentials .",
    "unfortunately , the hyperon - nucleon potentials based on the one - boson exchange model allow several sets of parameters , since hyperon - nucleon scattering data are very limited in accuracy as well as in statistical quality , as compared to the very precise data on the @xmath23 system .",
    "the information from the @xmath24-atomic data also leaves various shapes of possible potentials inside a nucleus , because the x - ray data are mainly sensitive to the potential outside the nucleus .",
    "information concerning the @xmath4-nucleus potential can provide a strong feedback not only in nuclear physics , but also in astrophysics .",
    "the role of strangeness in highly dense matter in a neutron star core is being intensively discussed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 interaction in nuclear matter is of particular importance , since @xmath24 is expected to appear first in dense neutron matter to moderate the chemical potential while maintaining the charge neutrality due to its negative charge @xcite .",
    "therefore , new experimental data on medium heavy nuclei are desired in order to extract a conclusive understanding about the @xmath4-nucleus potential .",
    "particularly , the central part of the @xmath4-nucleus potential is expected to be significant in heavy nuclei , where the lane term is less dominant due to its @xmath26 dependence .",
    "the present experiment ( kek - ps - e438 ) was carried out at the k6 beam line of the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron ( ps ) @xcite .",
    "we measured inclusive ( @xmath19,@xmath11 ) spectra for the first time on medium - to - heavy nuclear targets : ch@xmath0 , si , ni , in and bi . since the inclusive ( @xmath19,@xmath11 ) spectrum reflects the final state interaction of a @xmath24 with the residual nucleus , an analysis of the spectral shape would give the @xmath4-nucleus optical potential .",
    "the elementary reaction of @xmath27 was measured with a ch@xmath0 target in order to calibrate the energy scale and the cross section of the inclusive spectra .",
    "it is known that the elementary cross section at the forward - scattering angle decreases rather smoothly with an increase of the incident - beam momentum , while the momentum transfer ( @xmath28 ) increases rapidly below 1.2 gev/@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "a rapid change of @xmath28 makes the spectrum analysis complicated and requires a wider momentum acceptance spectrometer system for the scattered kaon .",
    "the beam momentum was thus chosen to be 1.2 gev/@xmath29 .",
    "a schematic view of the whole experimental setup is shown in figure [ figesetup ] .",
    "it is composed of two parts : a beam spectrometer , used to measure the incident pion momentum , and the sks system for the scattered kaon momentum .",
    "a detailed description of the spectrometer system can be found in ref .",

    "the beam - line spectrometer comprises a dipole magnet and four quadruple magnets ( qqdqq ) together with four sets of high - rate drift chambers ( bdc1 - 4 ) , a freon - gas erenkov counter ( egc ) and two sets of segmented plastic scintillation counters ( bh1 and bh2 ) .",
    "the electron contamination in the beam was rejected by egc with a rejection efficiency better than 99.9% .",
    "the bh1 was segmented into seven vertical pieces of 5 mm thick and was installed downstream of egc , while the bh2 was segmented into 5 vertical pieces of 3 mm thick . in order to reduce the energy - loss straggling in this counter , it was made as thin as possible and placed 40 cm upstream from the experimental target .",
    "the bh2 was used as a time - zero counter for timing measurements of incident and scattered particles . by requiring timing coincidence between bh1 and bh2 , any contamination in the pion beam",
    "was rejected , where the beam trigger is defined as beam@xmath30 bh1@xmath31bh2@xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "the beam - line drift chambers ( bdc1 - 4 ) were placed upstream and downstream of the qqdqq system . in order to operate under a high counting rate of several m / spill",
    ", the sense - wire spacing were made to be short ( 5 mm ) , where the drift space was @xmath22.5 mm .",
    "each chamber had six layers of sense - wire plane ( xxuuvv ) , where the vertical and @xmath215@xmath33 tilted wire planes were denoted by x , u and v , respectively .",
    "the beam track was measured by bdc s with a position resolution of 300 @xmath34 m in rms .",
    "the beam momentum was obtained particle - by - particle by using a third - order transport matrix . in order to minimize the multiple - scattering effects on the momentum resolution ,",
    "the qqdqq system was designed so as to make the @xmath35 term of the transport matrix to be zero between the focal planes close to the entrance and exit windows of 100 @xmath34 m thick stainless steel of the vacuum beam pipe and the drift chambers were made as thin as possible .",
    "the magnetic field of the dipole magnet ( d2 ) was monitored throughout the experiment for every spill with a high - precision hall probe in order to correct its fluctuation in the off - line analysis .",
    "the sks spectrometer has a large acceptance of 100 msr , a good momentum resolution of 0.1% ( fwhm ) , and a linearity of within 0.1 mev/@xmath29 in its momentum acceptance of @xmath210% @xcite .",
    "the sks system is thus suitable to obtain high statistics over a wide excitation energy region with a good energy resolution , while maintaining the sensitivity of the imaginary part of the @xmath4-nucleus potential because a bad resolution may cause the spectrum to smear out .",
    "sks comprises a superconducting dipole magnet together with four sets of drift chambers ( sdc1 - 4 ) for momentum reconstruction and three kinds of trigger counters .",
    "the trigger counters comprise a scintillation counter wall ( tof ) , a lucite erenkov counter wall ( lc ) and two silica aerogel erenkov counters ( ac1 and ac2 ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ figesetup ] . the tof counter comprised 15 vertical scintillation counters , each 7@xmath31100@xmath313 @xmath36 in size , and was used for scattered particle identification by measuring the time - of - flight from the reaction point .",
    "the lc was a threshold - type erenkov counter comprising 14 pieces of 10@xmath31140@xmath314 @xmath36 lucite radiators ( n=1.49 ) , which discriminated protons from pions and kaons . ac1 and",
    "ac2 were threshold - type silica aerogel erenkov counters ( n=1.06 ) used to eliminate pions .",
    "the ( @xmath19,@xmath11 ) trigger was defined as pik@xmath30 beam@xmath31tof@xmath31lc@xmath31@xmath37 .",
    "the trigger rate was typically 300 counts for a beam rate of 2.0@xmath3110@xmath38 per spill .",
    "the drift chambers sdc1 and sdc2 were installed at the entrance of the sks magnet , while sdc3 and sdc4 were installed at the exit .",
    "sdc1 and sdc2 had the same drift - cell structure as the bdc s , as they were exposed to the beam .",
    "sdc3 and sdc4 had a large drift space of @xmath221 mm .",
    "the particle track with a position resolution of 300 @xmath34 m was measured by sdc s .    in the present experiment ,",
    "sks was excited mainly to 272 a , which corresponds to 2.2 tesla(t ) , in order to measure the spectrum in the quasi - free region covering partly below the @xmath24 binding threshold .",
    "in addition , with si and ch@xmath0 targets , sks was excited to two other different settings of 320 a(2.4 t ) and 210 a ( 1.9 t ) to measure the spectrum well below the @xmath24 binding threshold and in the highly excited regions , respectively .",
    "the central momentum of sks at 2.4 t , 2.2 t and 1.9 t were 780 mev/@xmath29 , 720 mev/@xmath29 and 620 mev/@xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum in one sks setting could be connected smoothly to another as the acceptance regions partly overlap .",
    "the scattered - particle momentum was obtained particle - by - particle by reconstructing a particle trajectory with the runge - kutta tracking method using a precisely measured magnetic field map in each setting @xcite .",

    "the measured spectra are characterized by gradually increasing the cross section along with an increase of @xmath39 and the yield maximum at around @xmath39 as high as 120 mev , as mentioned in section v. within the present framework of the calculation , we obtain a repulsive -nucleus potential to reproduce the measured spectra . a repulsive",
    "potential reduces the cross section at around the -binding threshold , and shifts the yield to a higher @xmath39 region . in the present analysis , we took into account only the leading term in the inclusive  reaction .",
    "one can consider a multiple - scattering ( multi - step ) process in the @xmath19 incident , @xmath11 production reaction , which is expected to increase the yield at a higher @xmath39 .",
    "although the effect of this multi - step process is open for future studies , it might reduce the size of the repulsive potential to fit the measured spectra .",
    "if the -nucleus potential is repulsive , it is natural to interpret that yields in the -bound region are due to a non - zero size of the imaginary potential , since these yields are beyond those expected from the coulomb potential and those mixed in with by smearing with the experimental resolution .",
    "it is suggested that the imaginary potential is estimated to be @xmath40@xmath4112 mev or more by the standard expression @xmath40@xmath42/2@xmath40@xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the fermi averaging of the product of the relative velocity in @xmath45 and the   conversion cross section , and @xmath46 is the proton density at the nuclear center @xcite .",
    "this estimation is rather good for a low - energy @xmath45 interaction . for a higher momentum @xmath45 interaction ,",
    "as is expected in a large momentum - transfer reaction ,  , the imaginary potential may be deeper according to theoretical estimations @xcite , although this statement is still unclear , since the experimental data on the  cross section are limited at a higher momentum region .",
    "several sets of the hyperon - nucleon potential , based on the one - boson - exchange model , have been reported from the nijmegen group @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to calculate the @xmath4 potential in nuclei and/or in nuclear matter using this two - body potential .",
    "most of them gave rather attractive @xmath4 potentials @xcite , but those with the nijmegen model - f ( nf ) potential gave repulsive @xmath4-nucleus potentials @xcite .",
    "the size of the repulsive potential was estimated to be + 3.6 - 8.1@xmath47 mev in nuclear matter by using nf @xcite .",

    "the nf - based potential has a repulsive core with a height @xmath4030 mev and an attractive pocket at the nuclear surface .",
    "the sizes of the imaginary potentials for nd , nf , and nsc are @xmath40@xmath413.5 mev , @xmath417.4 mev , and @xmath4115 mev .",
    "the -nucleus potential suggested from the present measurement and the fitting analysis is more repulsive than those based on nd , nf , and nsc .",
    "a @xmath4 single - particle potential has also been calculated @xcite using the quark - model - based hyperon - nucleon interaction , model - fss proposed by the kyoto - niigata group @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 potential turns out to be 20.4 mev repulsive , since the @xmath14(@xmath49=3/2 ) @xmath50 state shows a strongly repulsive nature due to the pauli - exclusion effect between the quarks .",
    "a repulsive -nucleus potential has been derived so as to reproduce the -atomic @xmath51-ray data by employing a phenomenological density dependent ( dd ) potential @xcite , or the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite .",
    "the dd potential shows a strongly repulsive core having a height of @xmath4095 mev at the nuclear center with a shallow attractive tail outside of the nucleus ; the imaginary potential is as deep as @xmath40@xmath4135 mev .",
    "the rmf approach was used to construct a schrdinger - equivalent -nucleus potential from the scalar ( attractive ) and vector ( repulsive ) dirac potentials , while fitting the experimental -atomic x - ray shift and width .",
    "this approach shows a change of the -nucleus potential from attractive to repulsive in the nuclear interior along with an increase of @xmath52 from 1/3 to 1 , where @xmath52 is the vector meson coupling ratio .",
    "the fitting is better when @xmath52 increases . in the case of si ,",
    "the real and imaginary potentials are , respectively , about 30@xmath4040 mev , and as deep as 40 mev in the nuclear interior . the -nucleus potential derived by fitting the -atomic data seems qualitatively close to that obtained from the present analysis of the  spectra .",
    "however , the calculated si  spectrum with the dd potential within the present framework did not fit the measured spectrum very well , as shown in fig .",
    "this does not show that the volume of the dd potential is strongly repulsive .",
    "since the @xmath51-ray data suggests the attactive potential in the atomic orbital region , the present woods - saxon type repulsive potential does not reproduce the @xmath51-ray data .",
    "therefore , further studies on the -nucleus potential would be required to explain the present measurements and the @xmath51-ray data , where more careful choices of the nuclear and -nuclear radii and the figure of the -nucleus potential at the nuclear surface and outside the nucleus would be necessary .",

    "the @xmath24 appearance in dense neutron matter is sometimes discussed based on an attractive @xmath4-nucleus potential in nuclear matter of normal density @xcite . on the other hand , the hyperon mixing in dense neutron matter is discussed based on the repulsive @xmath4-nucleus potential derived from the @xmath24-atomic @xmath51-ray data in @xcite . in this regard , the repulsive -nucleus potential from the present result should be taken into account for discussing the hyperon dynamics in neutron - star cores .",
    "in the present experiment , we measured the inclusive ( @xmath19,@xmath11 ) spectra for the first time on several medium - to - heavy nuclear targets ( c , si , ni , in , and bi ) with reasonable statistics . the calibration of the horizontal axis ( @xmath53 ) was done successfully with a precision of better than @xmath20.1 mev ; also the angular distribution of the measured elementary cross section well reproduced previous bubble - chamber data , indicating a reliability of the measured cross section .",
    "the energy resolution was obtained to be 3.31@xmath20.33 mev ( fwhm ) .",
    "all spectra show a similarity in shape , at least at an energy region of @xmath54 mev ; also the mass - number dependence of the cross section was found to be rather weaker than that from the eikonal approximation .",
    "we perfirmed a dwia calculation of the inclusive  spectra on si , ni , in , and bi , for various depths ( heights ) of the woods - saxon - type , one - body @xmath4-nucleus potential , and compared it with the measured ones concerning the shape .",
    "the present analysis demonstrated that a repulsive -nucleus potential having a nonzero size of the imaginary part is required to reproduce the observed spectra .",
    "however , further studies on the -nucleus potential , particularly choices of the nuclear and -nuclear radii and the details of the potential shape at the nuclear surface and outside the nucleus , would be required in order to explain both the present measurements and the @xmath51-ray data .",
