    "network operators continuously upgrade their networks due to increasing demands for ubiquitous communications caused by two reasons .",
    "the increased burstiness of high - volume traffic is the first . as popularities of cloud computing , internet of things ( iot ) , and high - speed mobile communications increase",
    ", network traffic is becoming extremely dynamic and bursty .",
    "thus , just enlarging the network capacity is not an economical choice for network operators , while neglecting it will strongly affect the qos .",
    "second , various emerging networking applications , such as online gaming , data backups and virtual machine migrations , which are aimed at ubiquitous communications , also result in heterogeneous demands in optical telecom networks .",
    "in addition , today s network customers request more customized services , such as virtual private network ( vpn ) and video on demand ( vod ) , as well as more differentiated requirements with different prices @xcite . for some of the traffic",
    "which is delay - insensitive and can accept some compromise in bandwidth or other aspects , it can be preempted by more ",
    "important \" requests when the network becomes congested .",
    "therefore , to maintain cost - effectiveness and customers loyalty , network operators can provide different grades of service besides sufficient bandwidth for these emerging demands , instead of managing to support all the traffic without distinction @xcite .    to address these problems , _",
    "degraded provisioning _ is proposed for network operators to provide a degraded level of service when network congestion occurs instead of no service at all .",
    "generally , degraded provisioning refers to two different approaches : 1 ) keeping the total amount of transferred traffic constant by time prolongation or modulation level adjustment with immediate service access ( qos - assured ) , and 2 ) directly degrade request bandwidth without time or modulation compensation , or no guarantee for immediate access ( qos - affected ) .",
    "we focus on qos - assured degraded provisioning problems in this study .",
    "when performing degradation , two questions may come up : which request to degrade ? and how much to degrade ?",
    "a new service level agreement ( sla ) @xcite with the customer may answer these questions when traffic requests are sorted in different priorities in service - differentiated networks .    in multi - layer networks , qos - assured degradation has different implementation methods in different layers .",
    "the basic idea of degraded provisioning in electric layer is trading time for space .",
    "this means that , for a delay - insensitive and degradation - tolerant traffic request , when congestion occurs and the bandwidth is in shortage , we degrade its transmission rate to enlarge the current available bandwidth ( space ) , and extend its service holding time accordingly on the premise that the full traffic amount is constant .",
    "note that a traffic request can not be degraded arbitrarily , and it may be constrained by a certain deadline , no matter strict or relaxed @xcite . in the elastic optical layer , degradation refers to decreasing the number of occupied spectrum slots for a lightpath and raising the modulation level accordingly to guarantee the data rate of the lightpath . in ofdm - based elastic optical networks ,",
    "modulation level can be reconfigured in the dsp and dac / adc via software @xcite , which enables the dynamic adjustment of lightpath modulation level . however , higher - level modulation tends to have shorter transmission reach @xcite , which is also a constraint on optical degradation .",
    "therefore , we should consider different constraints in both layers together to perform degraded provisioning in multi - layer networks .      due to the flexibility enabled by degraded provisioning",
    ", there have been many studies on this topic in different kinds of optical networks in recent years . in conventional wdm networks ,",
    "roy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied supporting degraded service using multipath routing in a qos - affected way .",
    "@xcite studied reliable multipath provisioning , exploiting the flexibility in bandwidth and delay .",
    "andrei _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed a deadline - driven method to flexibly provision services in optical networks , but this work provided equal accessibility to all requests without distinction and did not guarantee immediate service access .",
    "@xcite introduced a dynamic scheme to reduce blocking by exploiting degraded - service tolerance in telecom networks in qos - affected way , but this work tried to degraded the minimum number of connections without considering different priorities of requests .",
    "they also applied this qos - affected degraded - service - provisioning method to increase network survivability @xcite with certain sla .",
    "mixed - line - rate ( mlr ) network was proposed to provide flexibility in optical layer to reduce transmission costs @xcite . in mlr networks ,",
    "vadrevu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a qos - affected degradation scheme using multipath routing to support degraded services considering minimum - cost mlr network design .",
    "but the itu - t grid limit still putd constraints on optical layer flexibility .    as a major development of optical - layer technology ,",
    "elastic optical networking enables more flexibility in optical modulation and spectrum allocation @xcite .",
    "distance - adaptive spectrum resource allocation @xcite is a similar approach as optical degradation , but its limitations are that the modulation format of a lightpath is configured at one time based on the transmission reach and can not be adjusted according to the fluctuation of traffic .",
    "@xcite proposed a dynamic algorithm for joint multi - layer planning in ip - over - flexible - optical networks , but this work did not consider dynamic adjustment of lightpath modulation format when network congestion occurs .",
    "recent progress in modulation format conversion @xcite enables all - optical ook to 16qam adjustment , and its advantages in elastic optical networking were demonstrated by yin _",
    "@xcite when modulation format can be converted at an intermediate node of a lightpath .",
    "therefore , the concept of degraded provisioning can be extended to the elastic optical layer , and this important issue has not been fully understood , with no previous studies .      in this work ,",
    "we investigate the dynamic qos - assured degraded provisioning problem in service differentiated multi - layer elastic optical networks .",
    "we summarize our contributions as follows : 1 ) to the best of our knowledge , this is the first investigation on qos - assured degraded provisioning problem in multi - layer networks with optical elasticity ; 2 ) we propose an enhanced multi - layer network architecture and solve the complex dynamic degraded routing problem ; and 3 ) we further propose novel dynamic heuristic algorithms in both layers to achieve degraded resource allocation .",
    "illustrative numerical results show that a significant reduction of network service failures can be achieved by multi - layer degradation , up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "in dynamic traffic scenario , traffic requests arrive one at a time and hold for certain durations .",
    "we design dynamic heuristic algorithms to cope with online degraded provisioning problems in realistic topology .",
    "we first decompose the problem into two subroutines : 1 ) degraded routing , and 2 ) degraded resource allocation .",
    "degraded routing solves the subproblem of degraded - route computation when conventional routing can not be performed due to resource shortage in some links of the network .",
    "optical degraded routing acts similarly as electric degraded routing , and the term _ request _ here refers to the _ lightpath request _ in optical layer , and the _ service request _ in electric layer .",
    "there are two major considerations on degraded routing : route hops and potential degraded requests .",
    "the route hops represent the overall amount of resources occupied by the new request , while the potential degraded requests represent how much the new request will affect existing requests .",
    "we define a link in any layer of the multi - layer network as a tuple : @xmath0 , which is the @xmath1 link from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is a set that contains existing requests routed on this link , and @xmath5 is the available capacity of this link .",
    "@xmath6 is a request , and @xmath7 is a degraded route for @xmath6 in electric or optical layer .",
    "we introduce two metrics to evaluate the route @xmath7 .",
    "route hops ( rh ) represents the resource occupancy of a request , and potential degraded requests ( pdr ) evaluates the impact of a request on existing requests .",
    "note that the @xmath9 operation returns the number of elements in a set , and numbers of them are calculated as : @xmath10 @xmath11.\\mathbf{\\theta}| % \\vspace { -0.5em}\\ ] ]    to calculate a route for minimizing rh , the dijkstra algorithm is applied . however",
    ", minimizing pdr is not that easy . because the minimizing - pdr problem aims to obtain a route that has the smallest pdr among all possible routes between a given source - destination ( s - d ) pair , while existing requests on a link are time - varying and several links may support the same request together .",
    "a straight - forward idea is to list all possible routes between a given s - d pair and compare their pdr .",
    "but , the complexity of this process is @xmath12 ( @xmath13 denotes the number of nodes ) , which is not suitable for dynamic traffic , and new methods are needed .    here",
    ", we propose the enhanced multi - layer network architecture by introducing the auxiliary _ request layer _ , which lies directly above the electric layer ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and solve the minimizing - pdr problem in polynomial time .    in the enhanced multi - layer architecture ,",
    "the request layer consists of all nodes in the other two layers and directional weighed links .",
    "link weight equals to the number of existing requests between the node pairs .",
    "in fact , in our proposed architecture , it is existing requests , rather than available resources in conventional multi - layer networks , that are mapped to the upper layer .",
    "this is because the goal is to minimize the potential affected requests , not resource occupancy . with this enhanced architecture , the _ minimizing - pdr problem _ on one layer ( optical or electric layer )",
    "is transformed into a _ weighed shortest - path problem _ on the upper layer ( electric or request layer ) , and thus can be solved using a shortest - path algorithm .        ' '' ''     + * algorithm * : minimizing - pdr algorithm +    ' '' ''     +    initialize topology matrix of the upper - layer @xmath14 ; @xmath15++ ; run dijkstra algorithm on the upper - layer topology @xmath16 , and a route @xmath17 is returned ; find a request among all @xmath18 with the shortest traffic hops in lower layer , and acquire its route ; combine all the acquired routes together , and return it ;    ' '' ''    now , we introduce two policies of degraded routing :      we manage to minimize rh first , and then minimize pdr .",
    "we try to minimize pdr as a primary goal , then we minimize rh .",
    "when a degraded route @xmath19 ( electric ) or @xmath20 ( optical ) is acquired , we need to decide which request or requests to degrade , and how much to degrade them . in the multi - layer network , degraded resource allocation refers to different operations in different layers , which should be further studied separately .",
    "we propose the ed - ba algorithm based on a determined degraded route .",
    "2(a ) shows the basic principle of the ed - ba algorithm , that requests with higher priorities can  preempt \" those requests with no higher priorities . here , the term  preempt \" means that some existing requests are degraded in transmission rate due to arrival of a new request with priority no smaller than them .",
    "degradation in transmission rate will cause service - holding - time prolongation , which should not exceed the deadline of the request .",
    "meanwhile , when performing degradation , we manage to degrade the minimal number of requests to provide just - enough bandwidth for the new arriving one .    for convenience , a traffic service request on electric layer is defined as a tuple : @xmath21 , which mean source , destination , bandwidth , arrival time point , holding time , prolongation deadline and priority of a service request , respectively .",

    "an event - driven dynamic simulator has been developed to verify the effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms .",
    "six degrdation policies ( oe - minpdr , o - minpdr , e - minpdr , oe - minrh , o - minrh , e - minrh ) , which are combinations of two degraded routing policies ( minpdr , minrh ) , and three degraded resource allocation policies ( oe : both - layer degradation , o : optical degradation only , e : electric degradation only ) are studied .",
    "4 depicts the bandwidth blocking probability ( bbp ) advantages of our proposed scheme over the conventional scheme ( threshold - based grooming @xcite , no degradation ) with different degradation policies .",
    "4(a ) shows the overall performance of all requests , and we can find there is a crossing point between optical degradation and both - layer degradation . in low - load area",
    "( 26 - 34 @xmath79 ) , both - layer degradation ( oe - minpdr , oe - minrh ) performs the best , up to two orders of magnitude , while in high - load area ( 36 - 44 @xmath79 ) , optical - layer degradation ( o - minpdr , o - minrh ) performs the best .",
    "the reason is that , in high - load conditions , electric degradation ( e - minpdr , e - minrh ) achieves worse bbp than no degradation , which affects the blocking reduction by optical degradation in both - layer degradation . figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(c ) show the bbp performance of requests in the highest and lowest priority .",
    "and we can conclude that all degradation policies can achieve significant blocking reduction in the highest priority , while , for the lowest - priority , the blocking performance acts similar as requests with all priorities do .",
    "we also observe some common patterns in these three graphs .",
    "first , optical degradation performs almost the same regardless of priorities , because optical degradation does not involve service priorities as electric degradation does .",
    "second , minpdr performs better in optical - related degradations ( both - layer degradation and optical degradation ) , while minrh performs better only in electric degradation .",
    "this is because the route minpdr returns tends to have a smaller number of existing requests , which increases the elements in assi or sbtl , thus increasing possibility of successful optical degradation .",
    "and the route minrh returns tends to have more existing requests , which provides more requests ( thus , more bandwidth and more opportunity ) for the arriving request to preempt on electric layer , which increases the possibility of successful electric degradation",
    ". actually , different mechanisms of optical degradation and electric degradation determine that minpdr is more suitable for optical degradation , while minrh suits electric degradation better . the result that both - layer degradation and optical degradation performs similarly reveals that optical degradation has stronger influence on blocking reduction because it can enlarge the network capacity by high - order modulation while electric degradation just deals with the bandwidth - time exchange to trade time for bandwidth under a given network capacity .      to study the instantaneous working mechanism and performance of the proposed degraded provisioning scheme , we conduct transient analysis on instantaneous network throughput and bbp , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "5 . from figs . 5(a ) and 5(b ) , we obtain similar conclusions as the dynamic evaluations , that optical - related degradation achieves better compliance with the offered load in minpdr , while electric degradation accomplishes better improvements in minrh .",
    "5(c ) shows the instantaneous bbp variance over time , and we observe that different levels of blocking reduction can be achieved by different degradation policies , both - layer degradation policies have the largest blocking reduction , and oe - minpdr performs even better ( almost zero blocking ) .",
    "in this work , we investigated dynamic qos - assured degraded provisioning problem in service - differentiated multi - layer networks with optical elasticity . we proposed and leveraged the enhanced multi - layer architecture to design effective algorithms for network performance improvements .",
    "numerical evaluations showed that we can achieve significant blocking reduction , up to two orders of magnitude via the new degraded provisioning policies .",
    "we also conclude that optical - related degradation achieves better performance with minpdr , while electric degradation has lower blocking with minrh due to different mechanisms of multi - layer degradation ."
