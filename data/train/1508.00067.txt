    "the devices were fabricated ( figure s1 ) on commercially available si@xmath2n@xmath3 coated silicon wafers .",
    "the stoichiometric si@xmath2n@xmath3 layer was 250  nm thick and grown via low pressure chemical vapor deposition ( lpcvd ) , with an internal tensile stress of @xmath52  gpa measured by the wafer bowing method .",
    "a layer of positive tone electron - beam ( e - beam ) resist was spin - coated on the si@xmath2n@xmath3 film , followed by e - beam lithography at 100  kev and development in hexyl acetate at 8@xmath53c .",
    "the patterns were transferred to the si@xmath2n@xmath3 film by a chf@xmath2/ar / o@xmath51 inductively - coupled plasma reactive ion etch ( rie ) .",
    "note that this rie step left a thin layer of sio@xmath51 on top of the exposed si , preventing a successful koh undercut .",
    "thus , we carried out an additional sf@xmath54/c@xmath3f@xmath55 inductively - coupled plasma rie to remove the sio@xmath51 layer .",
    "the resist was then removed by nanostrip .",
    "the fabrication process is finished by device undercut in a 20  @xmath27 koh bath at room temperature and a following n@xmath51 blow - dry .",
    "measurements of optical and mechanical modes were performed using the characterization system shown in figure s2 .",
    "light from a 1425  nm to 1470  nm tunable laser was sent through a polarization controller and into an optical fiber taper waveguide  @xcite , which provided evanescent coupling into and out of the microdisk resonator .",
    "the device under test was housed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure @xmath56  pa ( @xmath57  torr ) .",
    "motion of the mechanical resonator introduced a time - varying effective refractive index of the microdisk and hence modulated the optical mode wavelength .",
    "thus , fixing the laser wavelength onto the shoulder of the optical mode resulted in intensity - modulated light transmission from the optical resonator .",
    "this output light was split by a fiber coupler , where 10  @xmath27 of the power was used for swept - wavelength spectroscopy of the optical cavity modes , while the remaining 90  @xmath27 was sent to a photodetector whose electrical output signal was spectrally analyzed .",
    "each mechanical mode was manifested in a strong peak in the radio frequency ( rf ) spectrum .        in this work",
    ", we used the fiber taper probe due to the flexibility it provided in enabling measurement of devices across multiple chips .",
    "the fiber taper was fabricated by heating and stretching an optical fiber to thin its diameter down to approximately 1 m . in addition , a local indentation ( ` dimple ' ) with 10 m radius of curvature was formed at the thinnest region of the taper so that it could be used for selective probing2 . in future",
    "work focused on force sensing applications , it will be replaced by an integrated on - chip wave guide with pigtailed optical fibers .",
    "in order to better understand the performance of the tuning fork design as well as the experimentally measured spectrum data , we calculated the residual stress , mechanical modes , thermoelastic dissipation ( ted ) , optical modes , and the resulting optomechanical coupling parameters in our devices in a commercial fem software . the principles of the calculation , as well as the key results of stress tuning , are described in detail below .",
    "all the devices are doubly clamped to maintain the intrinsic high tensile stress in the lpcvd si@xmath2n@xmath3 film ( 1078 mpa in our samples ) .",
    "the uniformly distributed stress in the film and in the device before undercut will be redistributed after undercut . as a result",
    ", the free - standing clamps will shrink after the devices undercut , resulting in the thin beams being stretched , and hence the residual stress is increased ( as shown in figure s3 ) .",
    "the residual stress was calculated by a structural mechanics stationary analysis , given a fixed boundary condition at the end of each clamp and the pre - stress in the si3n4 film ( 1078 mpa ) as the initial condition .",
    "the result shows that for all the devices , the tensile stress in the beams became larger while that in the clamps became smaller .",
    "figure s3 shows the result of the tuning fork and single beam device with 20  @xmath25 m beam length . for the single beam device ,",
    "the stress is increased to 1316 mpa in the beam after undercut , while decreased to 197 mpa in the clamps .",
    "similarly , the tuning fork has a stress of 1318 mpa in the beam and 196 mpa in the clamps .",
    "the exaggerated deformation shows the shrinkage of the clamps and the elongation of the beams . a further increase in the beam stress ( and corresponding increase in mechanical frequency )",
    "can be achieved by modifying the clamp design . to that end",
    ", we also designed a high - stress fork which has a 100  @xmath25 m long clamp on one side , as shown in fig .",
    "1(f ) in the manuscript . in this device",
    ", the beam stress after undercut is calculated to be 3080 mpa , which is approximately 3 times the intrinsic si@xmath2n@xmath3 film stress .",
    "this stress increase is manifested by an experimentally measured @xmath0 increase of 1.5 times and @xmath1 increase of 1.1 times , respectively , compared with regular tuning forks ( as shown in fig .  2 in the manuscript ; we note that the regular tuning forks themselves have the aforementioned 1.3 times increase in stress compared to the deposited film ) .",
    "these results confirm that this on - chip , design - enabled stress tuning method can be used to widely adjust the internal tensile stress and the resonant frequency of a nanomechanical resonator , which is of general importance for most of nanomechanical resonators to achieve high @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we note that these results are not specific to the tuning fork geometry , and that this stress tuning method is applicable to any doubly - clamped mechanical resonator with pre - distributed stress .",
    "the mechanical modes of the single beam and tuning fork resonators were calculated by solving the following eigenvalue problem for the equation of motion of the displacement field , with the residual tensile stress of the si3n4 film and geometric nonlinearity taken into account :      here , @xmath59 is the initial material density , @xmath60 is the displacement field , @xmath61 is the elastic part of second piola - kirchhoff stress tensor , and @xmath62 is the volume force vector .",

    ", @xmath64 denotes the heat capacity of the solid at constant stress , @xmath35 the absolute temperature , @xmath65 tje thermal conductivity , @xmath26 the heat source per unit volume , @xmath66 the reference temperature at which the strain and stresses take the initial values , and @xmath67 the material stain tensor .",
    "note the last term is a double dot product of two second - order tensors defined as @xmath68 , the result of which should be a scalar .",
    "the boundary condition we applied to the outer ends of the fork clamps is zero temperature deviation ( isothermal boundary condition ) .",
    "the resonant frequencies of both the in - phase and out - of - phase in - plane modes show general agreement ( to within 15  @xmath27 ) between simulation and experiment",
    ". the remaining discrepancy may be due to a number of factors , including the fabricated beam widths not matching the design values used in simulation , and imprecise modeling of the clamp region and underlying silicon supports .",
    "the latter is particularly important for short single beam devices , for which the specifics of the clamp geometry has a significant influence of mechanical mode frequency .",
    "the calculated @xmath20 values are much larger than the experimentally - measured @xmath1 , indicating that thermoelastic dissipation is not the dominant factor contributing to the observed energy decay rates .            given a specific geometry , the electric field can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem in eq .",
    "( s1 ) around a specific wavelength .",
    "a perfectly - matched layer was used to simulate open boundaries .",
    "in addition , since most of the electric field is concentrated in the periphery of the resonator , the influence from the si pedestal that supports the microdisk can be ignored in the calculation . for a disk resonator with a diameter @xmath73  @xmath25 m and si@xmath2n@xmath3 thickness @xmath74  nm",
    ", we found the te@xmath18 wgm at 1439.89  nm , which has a good match with the experimental result ( 1441.79  nm ) .",
    "the optomechanical coupling parameter @xmath75 quantifies the shift in the optical resonance frequency @xmath76 per unit displacement @xmath77 of the mechanical resonator , that is , @xmath78 . as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , a perturbation theory for shifting material boundaries  @xcite can be employed to derive the following expression for @xmath75 , which can be calculated from the mechanical and optical modes as determined above :      here , @xmath80 is the normalized mechanical displacement field ; @xmath81 is the surface normal ; @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote the modal electric and electric displacement fields , respectively , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , in which @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the permittivities of the tuning fork and air , respectively . to calculate @xmath75 ,",

    "s4 are evaluated , with @xmath81 obtained from the surfaces of the undeformed structure .",
    "the calculated @xmath31 is 140  mhz / nm for coupling between the first radial order , transverse electric ( te ) polarized disk mode in the 1450  nm band and the fundamental , in - plane and out - of - phase mechanical mode of the 12  @xmath25 m long tuning fork geometry ( @xmath88  mhz ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath75 values are only slightly smaller ( @xmath89  mhz / nm ) for the longer 20  @xmath25 m long tuning fork geometry ( @xmath90  mhz ) .",
    "we also compare these result with the calculation of @xmath75 by a second approach , in which a deformable mesh is used to simulate the change in optical mode frequency with respect to mechanical displacement .",
    "similar to our previous work  @xcite , we first simulated the relevant mechanical mode of the tuning fork ( in - plane and out - of - phase ) to obtain its frequency and mode shape .",
    "next , the tuning fork was deformed with the mechanical mode shape with a prescribed boundary displacement value .",
    "the optical modes in the disk with the deformed mechanical resonator were then calculated by solving the electromagnetic eigenvalue problem .",
    "we then adjusted the boundary displacement value and re - solve the electromagnetic eigenvalue problem . repeating",
    "this procedure enabled @xmath75 to be obtained as the slope of the fitted frequency - modal displacement curve .",
    "the calculated @xmath31 for the 12  @xmath25 m long tuning fork using this approach is 146  mhz / nm , which has a good match with that calculated by the perturbation theory approach ."

    "<S> this single choice of @xmath48 is consistent with the literature  @xcite and results in losses that do not exceed the experimentally measured total losses for any of the devices . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results show that the tuning fork structure helps to decrease the damping due to the material defect losses ( @xmath49 ) in addition to decreasing the clamping losses . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig3](b ) , differences between experimentally measured @xmath50 and simulated ( @xmath47 ) of single beam devices are much larger than those of the tuning fork devices , especially for shorter length beams , indicating higher clamping losses for single beam structures . in total , we believe the clamping loss , damping due to material loss , and ted are all reduced in the tuning fork structure , through localized deformation resulting from elastic wave interference .    from the characterization we also noticed that although they are nominally the same structures , samples from chip p3 have lower @xmath1 than those from other batches . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly consider whether this is due to surface losses , which are parts of the material losses . </S>",
    "<S> such losses are caused by the friction processes resulting from surface defects and roughness  @xcite and have been viewed as a potentially universal limiting loss mechanism in si@xmath2n@xmath3 nanomechanical resonators  @xcite , might be reduced in our structures via surface treatment . </S>",
    "<S> we immersed the p3 devices into 1:10 hydrofluoric acid : water ( hf : h@xmath51o ) for 90  s to remove a thin layer of material that may have been damaged during the dry etching process . </S>",
    "<S> according to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](b ) , @xmath1 for all of the devices on this sample were improved by up to 2 times after the hf treatment , approaching ( but not exceeding ) the highest values we have achieved in untreated samples ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> further investigation is needed to determine whether a surface treatment can be applied to yield higher @xmath1 values than the best untreated samples .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed silicon nitride tuning fork cavity optomechanical transducers . </S>",
    "<S> these structures simultaneously increase the resonant frequency ( @xmath0 ) and mechanical quality factor ( @xmath1 ) of the fundamental mechanical mode compared with single beam devices , by up to 1.4 times and 12 times , respectively , through an effective increase in the clamp stiffness and reduction in energy dissipation . by engineering the clamp geometry further </S>",
    "<S> , calculation indicates that we increase the tensile stress in the beams by 2.9 times compared with the intrinsic stress of the si@xmath2n@xmath3 film , resulting in an experimentally measured frequency increase of 1.5 compared with that of the regular tuning fork , while the mechanical damping remained unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the highest measured @xmath7 product of @xmath15  hz at room temperature is on par with the highest values reported for doubly - clamped si@xmath2n@xmath3 beams . </S>",
    "<S> this tuning fork design with both high @xmath1 and high @xmath0 can find applications in force sensing applications , including those that use active feedback cooling to damp mechanical motion  @xcite .    the authors acknowledge dr . </S>",
