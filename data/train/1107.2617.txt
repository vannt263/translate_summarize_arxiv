    "in contrast to cold - atom platforms , the environment in a solid is rather complex since the spins may couple to a wide variety of excitations . in the case of nv centers ,",

    "we follow a phenomenological approach rather than a microscopic one , where the magnetic noise is modeled by a random fluctuation of the resonance frequencies associated to the electron / nuclear spins .",

    "these random processes can be argued to be _ gaussian _ by means of the central limit theorem . besides",
    ", when the back - action of the system is small  @xcite , or we are interested in the long - time dynamics , the process can be treated as _ markovian _ and _ stationary_. in this case , one obtains a langevin equation with @xmath193 , and @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the relaxation time of the process , and @xmath25 the diffusion speed .",
    "the solution to this equation can be obtained explicitly , and is known as the _ ornstein - uhlenbeck _ ( ou ) process  @xcite . in the case of zero - mean random magnetic fields ,",

    "_ effective decoupling mechanisms.- _ an advantage of the phenomenological noise models is that they allow a neat understanding of the effects of decoherence , together with possible strategies to overcome them . in the particular case of the driven hamiltonian  , it is easy to observe that the fluctuation of the electronic resonance frequencies , @xmath218 , tries to induce transitions between the energy manifolds of fig .",

    "<S> in this driven regime , it is the longitudinal hyperfine coupling @xmath16 which induces such virtual transitions . </S>",
    "<S> a schrieffer - wolff - type calculation yields the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath58 where we considered the inhomogeneous broadening of the hyperfine couplings @xmath59/\\omega_ej_{12}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian is an _ ising magnetic interaction _ between the nuclear spins , which are additionally subjected to a transverse field due to the driving , and a longitudinal field due to the hyperfine coupling . as advanced previously </S>",
    "<S> , we have been able to enhance the electron - mediated nuclear interaction , which becomes @xmath60khz for the parameters in table  [ o_magnitude ] . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the strength of the nuclear spin interaction has increased by three orders of magnitude @xmath61 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nuclear_gate]*(b ) * , we schematically describe the necessary ingredients for the nuclear zz gate . </S>",
    "<S> the initialization consists of the electron ( nuclear ) spin polarization @xmath62(@xmath63 ) , together with single - spin gates . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath62 is obtained by the optical pumping cycle available for nv centers  @xcite , whereas @xmath63 is based on the techniques developed for the nuclear single - shot measurement  @xcite , followed by the electron state - dependent fluorescence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once polarized , @xmath64 , one applies unitary gates based on microwave pulses of different duration , @xmath65 ( also for the electron spin ) , which lead to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of this state is dictated by the interaction - picture hamiltonian  , which leads to @xmath67 . due to the longitudinal field , and the additional contributions of @xmath68 , </S>",
    "<S> the simple periodic exchange of the nuclear spin excitation shall be accompanied by fast oscillations . in order to observe neatly the effect of the interaction </S>",
    "<S> , one may perform a spin - echo sequence , such that the nuclear spins are inverted at half the gate time by a microwave pulse @xmath69 . in this case , the fast single - nuclei oscillations refocus after the spin - echo period @xmath70 , and one observes solely the effect of the interaction . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nuclear_gate]*(d ) * , we compare the effective description   to the hamiltonian  , which display a clear agreement . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when the echo period matches twice the zz - gate time @xmath71ms , one finds a perfect excitation exchange @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath73 , this effect is completely absent . finally , considering @xmath74 , and setting the echo pulse along the y - axis , the dynamics generates a entangled nuclear state @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> once the gate has been performed , the nuclear operators @xmath76 , @xmath77 must be measured . </S>",
    "<S> since the state - dependent fluorescence is particular to the electron spins , one should map the nuclear information onto the electrons , and then measure . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved in a quantum non - demolition fashion by using a microwave on a electron - spin transition conditioned to the nuclei  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ decoupling from decoherence.- _ so far , our discussion has focused on the idealized situation of isolated nv centers . however , every quantum system is inevitably coupled to an environment that degrades its coherence . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , known as _ decoherence _ , must be seriously accounted for in solid - state materials , where the system - environment coupling is usually strong . in the particular case of nv centers , </S>",
    "<S> the major source of decoherence is the coupling to other impurity spins , such as single substitutional nitrogen electron spin ( p1 center ) in type ib diamond  @xcite , or @xmath0c isotopes in type iia  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic description of the spin bath is an intricate many - body problem , and is a current subject of intense research . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use a phenomenological model of the bath that yields a fluctuating magnetic field shifting the resonance frequencies . due to the spin interactions </S>",
    "<S> , this effective field is modeled as a stochastic ornstein - uhlenbeck process  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 are random processes with autocorrelation @xmath80 where @xmath81 represent variance of the zero - mean gaussian distributions , and @xmath82 the inverse of their correlation times . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the decoherence time of an electronic ( nuclear ) ramsey experiment is given by @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) . by considering the particular time - dependence of these stochastic processes </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically integrate the noisy dynamics , and average for @xmath85 realizations of the random process . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study the effects of decoherence on the gate .    for the slow xx gate ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nuclear_gate]*(a ) * ) , the limiting factor is the nuclear dephasing time , which can attain values of @xmath86 . even for the purest samples , </S>",
    "<S> the coherence of the gate is completely lost much before the target time @xmath87s is reached . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the performance of this gate is extremely poor . for the fast zz gate ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nuclear_gate]*(b ) * ) , not only the nuclear - spin dephasing , but also the electron - spin dephasing limit the gate accuracy . in the dressed - state basis </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ effective_coupling]*(d ) * ) , the electron dephasing tries to induce a transition between the different manifolds , introducing additional noise in the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the strong driving @xmath88 , these processes are partially suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a sufficiently strong nuclear driving , @xmath89 , provides an additional decoupling mechanism that enhances further the gate performance . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nuclear_gate]*(e ) * , one observes the announced decoupling , since the gate performance at the target time @xmath90ms is extremely good even for shorter electronic coherence times ranging from @xmath91ms to @xmath92s . due to the decoupling mechanism , the gate accuracy will actually be limited by the decay times @xmath93 . moreover , at this time scale , energy will be pumped into the system by the continuous driving . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that this limitation can be overcome since @xmath94 can be increased by orders of magnitude by cooling . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , one can achieve high fidelities .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally note that the effective decoupling mechanism presented here can also be used to improve the electron - spin gates based on the direct dipole interaction  @xcite . in that case , the role of the microwave driving is to prolong dephasing times and to bring the two dressed electronic transitions to resonance to overcome the inhomogeneous broadening .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions and outlook.- _ we have demonstrated the feasibility for engineering electron - mediated spin - spin interactions between the nuclei of two nv - centers . by continuous microwave driving , this scheme allow us to decouple from the electronic and nuclear dephasing sources , and increase the effective interactions by three orders of magnitude magnitude thus achieving @xmath95khz for distances of existing pairs of nv - centers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme opens the possibility for the realization of quantum information processors , quantum simulators and quantum - sensors  @xcite on the basis of nv - centers in diamond . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to stress the generality of this scheme , which can be applied to other solid - state technologies that are candidates for quantum - information processing .    _ </S>",
