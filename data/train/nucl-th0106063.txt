    "antiproton annihilation cross sections at very low energies ( @xmath10 mev / c ) have been reported for light nuclei by the obelix collaboration @xcite . at these energies",
    "the total @xmath0 reaction cross section consists only of @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "whereas at relatively higher energies ( @xmath11 mev / c ) the @xmath0 annihilation cross sections exhibit the well known @xmath12 strong absorption dependence on the nuclear target mass number @xmath3 , these cross sections at very low energies have defied any simple , obvious regularity .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the _ ` expected ' _",
    "@xmath13 dependence on the atomic charge @xmath2 and mass number @xmath3 is badly violated @xcite .",
    "antiproton annihilation cross sections at very low energies simply do not rise with @xmath3 as fast as is anticipated .    here",
    "i report a recent study of low energy @xmath0 annihilation on nuclei , using the optical model approach @xcite .",
    "optical potentials have been very successful in describing strong interaction effects in hadronic atoms @xcite , including @xmath0 atoms @xcite .",
    "it has been noted , for pions , that the total reaction cross sections at low energies are directly related to the atomic - state widths , and that once a suitable optical potential is constructed by reasonably fitting it to the atomic level shifts and widths in the negative energy bound state domain , these total reaction cross sections are reliably calculable @xcite .",
    "the recent publications @xcite of experimental results of total cross sections for @xmath0 annihilation on nuclei at very low energies raise the intriguing possibility of connecting these two energy regimes in a systematic way also for antiprotons . however , most of the data on annihilation cross sections for @xmath0 are for very light nuclei , where the concept of a rather universal optical potential that depends on @xmath3 and @xmath2 only through the nuclear densities is questionable . for this reason , in the present work ,",
    "optical potentials are used mostly for crossing the @xmath14 borderline within the _ same _ atomic mass range , from bound states to scattering .",
    "these potentials are strongly absorptive , which leads to a remarkable saturation of the total reaction cross section with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this review is organized as follows .",
    "the saturation phenomenon in @xmath0 atoms , and for @xmath0 total reaction cross sections , is described and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : sat ] .",
    "calculational results are given , demonstrating the success of using a unified optical potential methodology across the @xmath0-nucleus threshold .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 dependence of these low energy annihilation cross sections at @xmath15 mev / c is discussed .",
    "the coulomb modified strong absorption model at _ very _ low energies is described in sect .",
    "[ sec : abs ] and , particularly , how it successfully reproduces , due to the coulomb focussing effect , the optical potential reaction cross sections .",
    "lastly , in sect .",
    "[ sec : he ] , optical potentials which fit simultaneously low energy @xmath8he observables for @xmath6 , as well as for @xmath9 , are used to assess the reliability of extracting @xmath0 nuclear scattering lengths directly from the data .",
    "antiprotonic and @xmath16-atom optical potentials are strongly absorptive @xcite . this strong absorptivity has recently been shown @xcite to lead to a saturation of the widths of atomic states upon increasing the absorptivity of @xmath17 , and to the prediction of relatively narrow deeply bound atomic states .",
    "figures [ fig : pbarpb ] and [ fig : kpb ] show calculated @xmath0 and @xmath16 atomic energy levels in pb , respectively , for several values of @xmath18 .",
    "the bars stand for the full width @xmath19 of the level and the centers of the bars correspond to the binding energies re @xmath20 .",
    "it is seen that the calculated widths saturate at about 2 mev .",
    "the dependence on the model is found to be negligibly small , affecting the calculated widths by less than @xmath21 , provided the optical potential was fitted to the known part of the spectrum throughout the periodic table . for this heavy nucleus",
    "the levels are quite close to each other although the spectrum is still well defined . the @xmath22 @xmath0 level @xcite and the @xmath23 @xmath16 level @xcite in pb are the last observed in the respective x - ray spectra .",
    "the close analogy between bound - state widths and total reaction cross sections is best demonstrated , assuming for simplicity a schrdinger - type equation , by comparing the following expressions for the width @xmath19 and for the total reaction cross section at positive energies with each other :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the @xmath0 full atomic wavefunction and @xmath26 is the @xmath0 - nucleus elastic scattering wavefunction ; @xmath27 is the c.m",
    ". velocity .    a standard @xmath17 , to be used in the above expressions ,",
    "is given by the ` @xmath28 ' form @xcite    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the nucleon mass , @xmath31 is the reduced @xmath0-nucleus mass , @xmath32 is a complex parameter obtained from fits to the data and @xmath33 is the nuclear density distribution normalized to @xmath3 . although the effect of the @xmath34 factor may often be absorbed into the fitted parameters , as is the case in this section , for very light @xmath0 atoms one must include the effect of the underlying @xmath35 interaction , at least by folding a phenomenological interaction form factor into the nuclear density .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 level shift and width data in @xmath37he @xcite are well fitted by folding a gaussian with a range parameter of 1.4 fm into the nuclear density distribution .",
    "the resulting potential , with @xmath32=0.49+i3.0 fm , is highly absorptive . using this potential ( @xmath38 ) to calculate the total reaction ( annihilation ) cross section for 57 mev / c @xmath0 on @xmath39he ,",
    "the calculated cross section is 901 mb , in excellent agreement with the reported value of 915@xmath4039 mb @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : sat ] demonstrates the extreme strong absorption conditions which are relevant to the @xmath0 nucleus interaction at very low energies ( and for @xmath0 atoms ) .",
    "it shows calculated reaction cross sections for @xmath0 at 57 mev / c on @xmath39he and ne as function of the strength i m  @xmath32 of the imaginary part of the potential ( @xmath38 ) described above , with the rightmost edge corresponding to its nominal value i m  @xmath32=3.0 fm .",
    "it is seen that as long as the absorptivity ( i m  @xmath32 ) is very weak , less than 1% of its nominal value , @xmath41 is approximately linear in i m  @xmath32 , which according to eq .",
    "( [ equ : sat ] ) means that the @xmath0 wavefunction depends weakly on i m  @xmath32 .",
    "however , already at below 5% of the nominal value of i m  @xmath32 the reaction cross sections begin to saturate , much the same as for the widths of deeply bound @xmath0 atomic states @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is the same in both cases , namely exclusion of the wavefunction from the nucleus due to the absorption , which reduces dramatically the overlap with the imaginary potential in the integrals of eq .",
    "( [ equ : sat ] ) .",
    "the onset of saturation is determined approximately by the strength parameter 2@xmath31(im  @xmath17)@xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "thus , saturation of @xmath41 in ne starts at a smaller absorptivity than its onset in @xmath39he .",
    "the ne/@xmath39he ratio of @xmath41 values changes , due to this effect , from about 15 in the perturbative regime of very weak absorptivity to about 3 in the strong absorption regime .",
    "however , the precise , detailed pattern of the change also depends on re  @xmath17 which may enhance or reduce the exclusion of the @xmath0 wavefunction from the nucleus .",
    "figure [ fig : res ] shows calculated @xmath0 reaction cross sections at 57 mev / c across the periodic table .",
    "the dot - dashed line is for the above mentioned potential ( @xmath38 ) which is expected to be valid only in the immediate vicinity of he .",
    "the dashed line ( @xmath44 ) is for the first potential from table 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite which fits @xmath0 atom data over the whole periodic table , starting with carbon .",
    "this potential is not expected to fit data for very light nuclei , and indeed it does not fit the @xmath39he annihilation cross section .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that the two potentials predict almost the same cross sections for @xmath45 20 and certainly display a very similar dependence on @xmath3 . also shown in the figure is the recent experimental result @xcite for ne , with a very limited accuracy .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath45 20 the points along the solid line are the calculated @xmath46 - nucleus total reaction cross sections , obtained from potential ( @xmath44 ) by switching off the coulomb interaction .",
    "the solid line is a fit to an @xmath47 power law which appears to be appropriate to strong absorption of uncharged particles at very low energies . comparing the dashed line for negatively charged particles with the solid line for uncharged particles ,",
    "it is clear that the @xmath41 values obtained by including the coulomb interaction are considerably enhanced at this very low energy with respect to the ones obtained without it .",
    "this is due to the coulomb focussing effects which are discussed below .",
    "comprehensive measurements of @xmath46-nucleus total annihilation cross sections on six targets from c to pb at @xmath48 mev / c have been recently reported @xcite in terms of a factorized dependence on @xmath49 and @xmath3 :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is given explicitly as a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath49 .",
    "this essentially uniform @xmath12 behavior , which normally is expected only at considerably higher energies , is puzzling .",
    "furthermore , the reported @xmath46 cross sections for a given target , particularly at the lower end of the energy range , are too high to be compatible with the @xmath0-atom and @xmath0-nucleus phenomenology considered in this review . for example , eq .",
    "( [ equ : nbar ] ) gives about @xmath52 mb for @xmath46 annihilation at @xmath49 = 57 mev / c on ne , roughly three times the value shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] for @xmath46-ne using potential ( @xmath44 ) , and substantially higher than the @xmath0-ne annihilation cross section @xcite of @xmath53 mb .",
    "this persists , although to a lesser extent , also at higher energies .",
    "thus , at @xmath49 = 192.8 mev / c eq .",
    "( [ equ : nbar ] ) gives about @xmath54 mb for @xmath46-ne , whereas the measured annihilation cross section for @xmath0-ne at this energy is only @xmath55 mb @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the calculated @xmath0-nucleus total reaction cross sections at very low energies may be explained in terms of a simple coulomb - modified strong absorption model @xcite as follows .",
    "recall that an attractive coulomb potential causes focussing of partial - wave trajectories onto the nucleus , an effect which at low energies may be evaluated semiclassically , as recognized a long time ago by blair in connection with @xmath56 particle reactions on nuclei @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the applicability of the semiclassical approximation to coulomb scattering ) . assuming that complete absorption occurs in all partial waves for which the distance of closest approach is smaller than @xmath43 , one gets the following relation between the coulomb - modified @xmath57 and @xmath43 :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the standard coulomb parameter @xcite . at very low energies , @xmath60 , and therefore @xmath61 due to the focussing effect of @xmath62 .",
    "the total reaction cross section in the strong absorption limit is then given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the laboratory and c.m .",
    "wave numbers , respectively .",
    "the second term within the brackets represents the coulomb focussing effect and at very low energies it becomes dominant @xcite , thus leading to a @xmath13 dependence of the cross section if @xmath66 . at high energies , where the coulomb focussing effects become insignificant , the well known strong absorption value @xmath67 is obtained , giving rise to the expected @xmath12 dependence . in order to use expression ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , one needs to define an equivalent radius @xmath43 that will properly represent the @xmath0-nucleus interaction at the particular energy . for a density - folded @xmath0 optical potential which fits the atomic data for @xmath68",
    ", the following parameterization @xcite holds to a few percent for the whole range of very low energies up to @xmath69 mev / c :    @xmath70    equations ( [ eq : sigma],[eq : radep ] ) reproduce explicitly , for antiprotons , the dependence of the calculated total reaction cross sections on the three relevant parameters ( @xmath71 and energy ) .",
    "in this section i specialize to very light nuclear systems . excluding the deuteron for which the optical model approach obviously is not well suited , the next targets to consider are the he isotopes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 factor in eq .",
    "( [ equ : potl ] ) is now included . since the @xmath36 and the @xmath72 width data are incompatible with each other within an optical potential approach , as noted already in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath72 width data were excluded from the fitting procedure , partly on the grounds that the @xmath73-wave contribution to the very low energy @xmath0 annihilation cross sections is almost negligible compared to the dominant @xmath74 and @xmath75 waves ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting density - folded optical potential , referred to as ( @xmath76 ) , has the following parameters : 1.8 fm for the range parameter of the two - body gaussian interaction folded in with the he densities , and a strength parameter @xmath77 0.26 + i2.07 fm .",
    "again , its real part plays only a minor role .",
    "the @xmath36 level shifts and widths , as well as the @xmath0 total annihilation cross sections calculated using the optical potential ( @xmath76 ) are shown in table [ tab : he1 ] , where the measured values are also given , including a recent report of @xmath0 annihilation on @xmath78he @xcite .    .measured @xmath0 shifts ( @xmath79 ) and widths ( @xmath19 ) in ev @xcite , and @xmath0 annihilation cross sections ( in mb ) on @xmath78he @xcite , @xmath39he @xcite ( @xmath49 in mev / c ) .",
    "the calculations @xcite use potential ( c ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     regarding the behavior of the @xmath0-nucleus @xmath74-wave scattering lengths as function of @xmath3 , say for @xmath80 , the ( plain strong - interaction ) scattering lengths follow a simple geometrical picture , as borne out by a fit to @xmath0-atom data @xcite which has been recently updated @xcite :    @xmath81    thus , @xmath82 varies roughly as the nuclear radius @xmath43 , whereas @xmath83 is roughly constant over the periodic table .",
    "however , the coulomb - modified scattering lengths do not show such a clear geometrical picture @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , it was shown that the recently reported annihilation cross sections for @xmath0 on @xmath39he and ne at 57 mev / c are reproduced very well by strongly absorptive optical potentials which fit @xmath0 atomic data .",
    "for these potentials , the asymptotic @xmath13 dependence of the total reaction cross section follows from the coulomb focussing effect at very low energies .",
    "the full dependence on @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 was derived using a coulomb - modified strong absorption model .",
