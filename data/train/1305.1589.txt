    "scanning gate spectroscopy is realized by positioning the tip right above the qhi , and sweeping both @xmath5 and the dc current @xmath14 through the qpc .",

    "note that in such a small qhi , @xmath55 turns out to be smaller by at least one order of magnitude than the intrinsic @xmath56 in the same 2des  @xcite .",
    "this renders coherent resonant tunnelling through the whole qhi device possible .",
    "to interpret @xmath48 obtained from the fit , one first notes that @xmath8 evolves very similarly when changing either @xmath5 or @xmath7 in the vicinity of @xmath57 9 t ( fig . s2 - supplementary material ) .",
    "therefore , one can convert @xmath48 into an equivalent @xmath21 , through a lever arm @xmath58 0.108 t / v .",

    "[ fig : fig2](c ) since @xmath22 is at a maximum when the tip is above the qhi ( @xmath62 ) .",

    "@xcite , and in agreement with the exponential temperature dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we therefore have a fully consistent picture that explains all magnetoresistance , temperature dependence and spectroscopy data , and shows that tunnelling across the qhi is indeed coherent .",
    "one fundamental question remains : why do we observe two distinct behaviours of transport through apparently similar qh devices , coulomb blockaded transport in our previous work  @xcite , and coherent transport in this one ?",
    "the qualitative difference can not be explained by the fact that @xmath22 is smaller than previously examined qhis . @xmath32 and @xmath66 would be reduced proportionally , but not enough to explain the observed @xmath0-dependence and spectroscopy . on the other hand , signs of coherent transport through cb quantum dots were only obtained for symmetric tunnel junctions  @xcite that allow resonant tunnelling instead of sequential tunnelling . in that framework , one might thus ascribe the loss of electron coherence in other qhis to an asymmetry of tunnel junctions .",
    "however , a difference in the transmission coefficients @xmath67 of the tunnel barriers may point towards an alternative explanation . in the coherent regime",
    ", we find a rather strong coupling between the qhi and propagating es ( @xmath68 ) , which contrasts with the coulomb blockade regime where @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "a similar trend is observed in transport experiments at @xmath7 = 0 t on carbon nanotubes  @xcite : phase coherence is maintained when electrons tunnel through barriers with a large transmission coefficient , so that interference effects can be observed .     between edge states .",
    ", width=10 ]    up to this point , our analysis is based on the presence of a qhi near the qpc , connected to propagating es on both sides through tunnelling paths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , one could imagine the presence of additional tunnelling paths between propagating es , in the vicinity of the qpc saddle point . the resulting model is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a - b ) .",
    "while the `` green '' paths occur naturally when propagating es and the qhi are close enough , the `` red '' paths may originate from potential anharmonicities ( _ i.e. _ non parabolicity ) on both sides of the saddle point , similar to the fast potential variations suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    ", transport depends in principle on the various tunnelling probabilities , denoted @xmath70 and @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "however , the presence of the qhi should always induce oscillations in the magnetoresistance and spectroscopy of the qpc , either because it is enclosed in an interferometer , created by the `` red '' paths and propagating es , when @xmath72 , or because tunnelling occurs directly through it ( @xmath73 ) as discussed above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , whichever @xmath70 or @xmath71 dominates , transport is still controlled by the flux trapped in the qhi and hence its coulomb charging , so that the analysis developed above to extract parameters from the magnetoresistance and spectroscopy are still valid . in that case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath74 , the amplitude of the fringes leads us to @xmath75 ( for details see supplementary information ) .    in summary , we report first evidence for preserved electron phase coherence in tunnelling across a quantum point contact in the quantum hall regime .",
    "we propose a framework that explains all magnetoresistance , temperature dependence and spectroscopy data .",
    "this scenario relies on the presence of a potential hill that generates a quantum hall island near the saddle point of the qpc .",
    "our data therefore provide new signatures of coherent tunnelling in an ultra - small qh device .",
    "* device fabrication and 2des parameters . *",
    "our device is fabricated from a ingaas / inalas heterostructure grown by molecular beam epitaxy where a 2des is confined 25 nm below the surface ( the layer sequence of this heterostructure is detailed in @xcite ) .",
    "the qpc was patterned using e - beam lithography followed by wet etching .",
    "the qpc resistance @xmath8 is measured in a four - probe configuration : a low - frequency ( typically 10 to 20 hz ) oscillating current @xmath14 is driven between contacts 1 and 2 on fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] , and @xmath13 is measured between contacts 3 and 4 using a lock - in technique , with @xmath13 across the qpc always less than @xmath76 .",
    "next to the qpc , we patterned a hall bar where we measured a low-@xmath0 electron density and mobility of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "* sgm and sgs techniques . *",
    "all the experiments are carried out inside a @xmath79he/@xmath80he dilution refrigerator where a home - made cryogenic atomic force microscope ( afm ) was integrated  @xcite .",
    "the afm is based on a quartz tuning fork to which a commercial metallized si cantilever ( model csc17 from mikromasch ) is glued by means of a conductive silver epoxy .",
    "we image the sample topography by imposing a feedback loop on the shift in the tuning fork resonant frequency and using standard dynamic afm mode of operation . after locating the qpc we perform sgm .",
    "it consists of scanning the tip along a plane parallel to the 2des at constant distance of 25  nm from the surface , i.e. 50  nm from the 2des , with a bias voltage @xmath5 applied to the tip and recording simultaneously the device resistance @xmath8 . at the end of a set of sgm experiments , we image the topography of the qpc to ensure that , during that period , the position of the qpc did not change .",
    "the sgs is performed by positioning the afm tip at a fixed position in the vicinity of the qhi and by adding a dc current @xmath14 to the lock - in ac signal between contacts 1 and 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . the voltage between edge states @xmath40",

    "<S> +    electron phase coherence is the cornerstone of quantum devices and computation  @xcite . in that perspective , quantum hall ( qh ) devices are particularly attractive in view of their large coherence times  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum hall edge states ( es ) formed by landau levels ( ll ) crossing the fermi energy near sample borders are ideal one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems in which scattering vanishes exponentially at low temperature @xmath0  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the last few years witnessed great progresses in the transport spectroscopy of model qh localized states created by patterning quantum dots  @xcite or antidots  @xcite in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) .    in parallel </S>",
    "<S> , new tools were developed to probe the microscopic structure of confined electron systems in the qh regime . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , scanning gate microscopy  @xcite ( sgm ) makes use of a movable metallic tip , which is voltage - biased , to finely tune the electrons confining potential in its vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the geometry of propagating edge states and localized states can be modified at will  @xcite . very recently , sgm allowed us to locate active qhis in a qh interferometer  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , lateral confinement , e.g. in quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) , offers the possibility to connect a qhi to es through tunnel junctions , and thus form a new class of 1d-0d-1d qh devices ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> indeed , sgm and magnetoresistance data corroborate with coulomb blockade across a qhi located near the saddle point of the qpc . </S>",

    "<S> since , up to now , such interferences were exclusively observed in open qh devices , this observation sets the stage for a new electron transport scenario . </S>",
