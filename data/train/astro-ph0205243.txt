    "in the future , observations of galaxies ( and indeed of any astronomical sources ) will be performed using devices which combine high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution . by that time ,",
    "the phenomena of broad band filters and the quaint terminology surrounding their usage  magnitudes , @xmath0-corrections , color terms , _ etc . _",
    " will have long since been forgotten . however , until such time as wide field spatially - resolved spectroscopy is cheaply available , virtually all observations of galaxies will be made through broad band filters , and special care has to be taken to recover knowledge of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from these observations .",
    "reconstructing galaxy seds is nontrivial because seds of galaxies contain important information on scales considerably smaller than the width of typical broad band filters .",
    "furthermore , seds of distant galaxies are redshifted such that the more distant the galaxy , the further the observed bandpass is blueshifted relative to the rest - frame spectral energy distribution of the object observed .",
    "this paper focuses on a solution to these problems which ( in the optical wavelength regime ) is fast , robust , and consistent over a large range of redshifts .    in the past",
    ", people have accounted for these effects using `` @xmath0-corrections '' applied to the observed magnitudes . in these analyses",
    ", a function @xmath1 is added to the standard cosmological bolometric distance modulus @xmath2 to obtain the relationship between the apparent magnitude @xmath3 of band @xmath4 and the absolute magnitude @xmath5 of ( in general different ) band @xmath6 : @xmath7 the traditional definition of the @xmath0-correction takes @xmath8 ; however , we note that in practice many surveys do perform @xmath0-corrections from one bandpass to another when comparing high redshift and low redshift observations .",
    "sometimes a single function @xmath1 has been applied regardless of the galaxy type , though more recently it has become standard to use a discrete set of @xmath1 functions depending on galaxy type ( based either on morphology or spectral features ) .",
    "as described in @xcite and later papers , the function is based on the projection of an assumed galaxy sed redshifted to @xmath9 onto the measured instrument response as a function of wavelength ( including the effects of the atmosphere , the reflectivity of the mirrors , the filter transmission , and the response of the ccd device or photographic emulsion ) .",
    "for example , for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filter system , @xcite and @xcite have both presented results for the @xmath0-corrections of galaxies .",
    "each of these papers tabulates @xmath1 ( called @xmath10 by @xcite ) for galaxies of various morphological types , based on galaxy spectrophotometry . in @xcite",
    "is incorrect ; in fact , their @xmath10 is exactly equivalent to our @xmath1 . ]",
    "however , galaxies do not all have the same sed , nor are they selected from some discrete set of seds .",
    "for this reason , these schemes for applying the @xmath0-corrections can fail to be self - consistent : the sed assumed for the @xmath0-corrections can be significantly inconsistent with the observed galaxy colors ! as we demand more precision from our astronomical data analysis in new , large multi - band surveys , and in particular as we try to quantify the evolution of galaxies , we must take a more sophisticated approach to approximating fixed frame observations of galaxies .",
    "our approach here is to use a method for inferring the underlying seds of a set of galaxies at a range of redshifts by requiring that their seds all be drawn from a similar population . for each galaxy",
    ", we will recover a model sed , which can be used to synthesize the galaxy s magnitude in any bandpass .",
    "although the operation we are performing on the magnitudes is not a `` @xmath0-correction '' in the historical sense of the term , we will refer to it as such in this and subsequent papers .",
    "our approach is equivalent ( nearly identical ) to the photometric redshift estimation methods of @xcite , except we use slightly different coordinate systems for our sed template space .",
    "in fact , the software includes a fast and relatively accurate photometric redshift estimator based on their method .",
    "we implemented this system and are publishing it in order to lay the groundwork for upcoming papers which will rely heavily on the reliability of the fixed frame magnitudes determined here .",
    "because the sdss is one of the largest astronomical surveys to date , our method will be useful to a large number of other investigators , both inside and outside the sdss collaboration .",
    "thus , this paper also serves the purpose of describing the release of a piece of software .",
    "the computer software we distribute builds itself into a c shared object library , around which we have written both stand - alone c programs and idl routines .",
    "we have made the source code available publicly , through a web page and through a public cvs repository .",
    "improvements or ports to other languages implemented by users may be incorporated into the code upon request .",
    "the conditions of use for the code are that this paper be cited in any resulting refereed journal article and that the version of the code used is specified in any such paper .",
    "the version of the code used to make the figures for this paper is kcorrect v1_11 .",
    "we refer throughout this paper to @xmath11 magnitudes , first defined by @xcite to measure the ratio of the number of photons included in the signal of the detector relative to that number for a flat spectrum source with @xmath12 ergs @xmath13 s@xmath14 hz@xmath14 . for a source with a spectrum",
    "@xmath15 the @xmath11 magnitude should be ( for a perfectly calibrated @xmath11 system ) @xmath16 \\cr & = & -48.60 - 2.5 \\log_{10}\\left [ \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty } d\\nu \\nu^{-1 } f(\\nu ) r(\\nu ) } { \\int_{0}^{\\infty } d\\nu \\nu^{-1 } r(\\nu)}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the fraction of photons entering the earth s atmosphere which are included in the signal as a function of wavelength ( a unitless quantity ) .",
    "note that @xmath17 can be defined even for devices which do not count photons directly ( such as bolometers ) .",
    "this equation is written such that @xmath18 is in units of ergs @xmath13 s@xmath14 @xmath14 and @xmath15 is in units of ergs @xmath13 s@xmath14 hz@xmath14 , while @xmath19 is expressed in   and @xmath20 is expressed in hz .",
    "the normalizations defined here mean that an object with @xmath21 ergs @xmath13 s@xmath14 hz@xmath14 has all its ab magnitudes equal to zero .",
    "the @xmath22 appears in the integrand of the denominator of the first equation because @xmath23 for a `` flat spectrum '' source with @xmath24 .",

    "section [ data ] applies the method to galaxies in the sdss , showing that the fits are robust .",
    "section [ conclusions ] concludes and discusses future development of the method described here .",
    "first , we describe how we reconstruct galaxy seds from broad band magnitude measurements .",
    "second , we describe how we convert these seds into estimates of fixed frame galaxy magnitudes .      our task is to recover a model for the galaxy sed from broad band photometric measurements . since a set of broad band galaxy fluxes does not correspond uniquely to a particular sed , and",
    "because galaxy seds are known to have significant structure over wavelength ranges small compared to our bandpass , the inverse problem of reconstructing seds from broad band fluxes is ill - posed .",
    "the task is made yet more difficult by the fact that the separation of the filters are large compared to their widths ; the seds are thus not well - sampled in the nyquist sense of that term . however , we are not completely ignorant about the forms which galaxy seds take , so we can attempt to use what we know about galaxy seds to appropriately regularize our fits . the method described here for doing so follows closely the method of estimating photometric redshifts used by @xcite .",
    "it is designed to take advantage of what we already understand about galaxy spectral energy distributions .",
    "begin with an sed space defined by @xmath27 template galaxy seds @xmath28",
    "( for example from @xcite ) , where @xmath27 is large . in principle , this should be a complete set of galaxy seds if we want _ all _ galaxy seds to be in the space spanned by the @xmath28 ; in practice , this property is not necessary . given a set of @xmath28 , one can find an orthonormal set of spectra @xmath29 spanning the same space . to be more precise ,",
    "we define the dot - product in the space of galaxy spectra to be : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 define the wavelength range used to define orthogonality .",
    "these limits are defined not over the full range covered by the @xmath28 spectra , but instead over a smaller range which is within observable wavelengths over most of the redshift range of the sample .",
    "we then define the basis of the sed space such that the @xmath27 template seds , @xmath33 , are linear combinations of @xmath27 basis spectra @xmath34 and that @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 represents the kronecker delta ) .",
    "these conditions do not fully specify the @xmath34 , which naturally may be rotated arbitrarily within our @xmath27-dimensional subspace of spectral space .    in our case the number of observed bands is less than @xmath27 , so we can not determine an individual galaxy s position in this @xmath27-dimensional space from its broad band colors alone .",
    "however , as outlined by @xcite , one can find a lower dimensional space defined by @xmath37 vectors @xmath38 which best fits the _ set _ of galaxies , as follows .",
    "the sed of galaxy @xmath39 may be reconstructed from a linear combination of the basis spectra in this lower dimensional space : @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the components of the galaxy projected in the low - dimensional space . from this",
    "sed it is easy to determine the reconstructed flux @xmath42 in each survey bandpass by projecting the model sed onto the bandpass @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the response of the instrument in band @xmath43 .",
    "we define @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the estimated error in the observed flux @xmath48 in bandpass @xmath43 for galaxy @xmath39 . taking derivatives of @xmath49 with respect to @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "results in a set of equations bilinear in @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite describe how to iteratively solve this bilinear equation by first fixing @xmath51 and fitting for @xmath50 , then fixing @xmath50 and fitting for @xmath51 , and iterating that procedure .",
    "we define the `` total flux '' @xmath52 of each template as the flux in the range @xmath53 ; then an estimate of the flux in this range is @xmath54 .",
    "galaxies of some fixed @xmath55 clearly lie on a plane in the component space @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , a natural choice for the orientation of the axes @xmath38 is to let @xmath56 be perpendicular to the planes of constant @xmath55 ; in this manner , the coefficient @xmath57 in equation ( [ lincomb ] ) is directly proportional to @xmath55 and is thus purely a measure of the object s flux ( in the wavelength range @xmath58 ) , while the parameters @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 ) primarily measure the shape of the galaxy sed in the wavelength range @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath55 can be trivially related to @xmath62 , the total luminosity in this range , by the inverse square of the luminosity distance ( from , for example , @xcite ) . as it turns out , the parameters @xmath59 tend to be distributed approximately in an ellipsoid , with not much curvature within the space defined by the template seds .",
    "thus , we transform the axes such that @xmath63 is the mean of the distribution and rotate the axes @xmath64 ( for @xmath60 ) such that they are aligned with the principal axes of the ellipsoid .",
    "furthermore , we normalize the vectors @xmath64 such that the zeroth component @xmath65 is output by the code in units of ergs @xmath13 s@xmath14 ( within the range @xmath58 ) .    in this way , we can reconstruct seds based on the broad band magnitudes of galaxies . from these reconstructed seds",
    "one can estimate @xmath0-corrections , develop a measure of galaxy spectral type , or synthesize other measurements of galaxy flux .",
    "the templates determined during the procedure can , of course , be used to estimate photometric redshifts , as @xcite describes .",
    "sometimes we will want to apply direct constraints on the coefficients @xmath59 of the galaxy we are fitting .",
    "for example , in this paper we fit our templates to a set of galaxies with high quality photometry in all bands .",
    "however , we would like to use these templates to fit for the seds of other galaxies , which might have much worse photometry in one or more bands . since the errors in the photometry can be catastrophic ( that is , non - gaussian ) , when we fit the seds of the lower signal - to - noise galaxies it makes sense to at least weakly constrain these galaxies to have reasonable seds , in the sense that the @xmath59 ought not to be too different than those for well - measured galaxies .",
    "we can assume a gaussian prior probability distribution with a mean @xmath66 , a variance matrix @xmath67 , and a weight @xmath68 .",
    "we calculate a preliminary value of @xmath69 , assuming @xmath70 .",
    "then we constrain our fit by adding a term to @xmath49 as follows : @xmath71 the resulting @xmath49 can still be minimized linearly , so we have sacrificed very little in speed .",
    "note that with such a constraint , one can calculate @xmath0-corrections even for galaxies with only one or two bands measured , and still obtain sensible results .      to characterize @xmath0-corrections , consider again equation ( [ kcorrecteqn ] ) : @xmath72 the definition of an apparent ab magnitude is given by equation ( [ abdef ] ) .",
    "an absolute ab magnitude is defined to be the apparent ab magnitude which would be measured for a galaxy 10 pc distant , at rest . in the restricted case of ab magnitudes ,",
    "the resulting @xmath0-correction is given by : @xmath73\\ ] ] a more general expression holds for other magnitude systems ( such as the vega - relative magnitude system ) .    in practice",
    ", we will be concerned here primarily with transforming the apparent magnitudes in band @xmath4 to a band @xmath6 which is just the @xmath4 band shifted by a factor @xmath74 , which we will denote @xmath75 read , `` @xmath4-band shifted to @xmath76 . ''    in the case of transforming @xmath4 to @xmath77 @xmath78\\ ] ] in the special case that @xmath79 , one is transforming the magnitude of an observed galaxy at @xmath76 to its rest - frame magnitude in a band shifted by @xmath76 . for that case @xmath80",
    "independent of @xmath15 ( which is natural , since both magnitudes sample the same region of @xmath15 ) .",
    "the fact that one s uncertainties in @xmath15 do not matter makes the use of the fixed frame magnitudes shifted to the redshift of the object in question useful , when it is possible .",
    "we note in passing that @xcite state that the @xmath0-correction `` would disappear if intensity measurements of redshifted galaxies were made with a detector whose spectral acceptance band was shifted by @xmath81 at all wavelengths ; '' here we have just shown this statement to be untrue for an ab system ( though one could define a magnitude system in which this were true ) .    in practice",
    ", one can calculate the fixed frame magnitudes in one of two ways :    1 .",
    "simply reconstruct @xmath77 from the model @xmath82 2 .",
    "calculate the @xmath0-correction above and apply it to the observed @xmath4 magnitude    if the reconstructions of the observed magnitudes @xmath4 are very similar to the actual observations ( as we will show is the case for our fits ) , there is very little difference between these two methods .",
    "however , if the reconstructions are poor , there will be large differences between the methods ; in particular , method ( 1 ) will yield a color distribution of galaxies with artificially low dimensionality .",
    "having estimated @xmath83 , you can then calculate the luminosity by simply applying to the calculated magnitude the cosmological distance modulus ( that is , the luminosity distance - squared law , as tabulated by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "we want to emphasize here that , while @xmath0-correcting to a fixed frame bandpass is _ sometimes _ necessary in order to achieve a scientific objective , it is not _ always _ necessary or appropriate . because @xmath0-corrections are inherently uncertain ( the broad band magnitudes do not uniquely determine the sed ) they should be avoided or minimized when possible .",
    "for example , if one were calculating the evolution of clustering of red and blue galaxies separately , it would perhaps be wise to perform the separation not on the @xmath0-corrected colors of the galaxies but on the median color of @xmath84 galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "similarly , in situations where @xmath0-corrections can not be ignored , such as the calculation of the evolution of the luminosity function , their effect should be minimized by , for example , correcting to a band shifted to the median redshift of galaxies in the sample .    typically one s measurements will be difficult to connect to solar luminosities in @xmath85 ( unless @xmath86 ) , simply because nobody has projected the appropriate stellar spectrophotometry onto these bandpasses .",
    "however , it is our position that stars are better understood than galaxies , and that it is therefore simpler in the end to stay as close as possible to the system in which the galaxies are observed . in any case",
    ", astronomy is quickly reaching a level of precision for which the exact nature of the bandpasses used has to be known and considered in most analyses of observational data .",
    "the reader may ask why , if we are basing our @xmath0-corrections on a full model of the galaxy sed , we do not correct to bandpasses with simpler shapes ( for example , top hats ) .",
    "the reason is that we want the effective bandpasses to actually have been observed for some galaxies in the sample , so that the @xmath0-correction for those galaxies are independent of the galaxy sed .",
    "this property is desirable because , as noted above , there are inherent uncertainties in the @xmath0-corrections due to our lack of knowledge of the seds .",
    "nevertheless , we note that synthesizing top hat magnitudes may be appropriate in certain situations , as they have the virtue ( similarly to the @xmath11 magnitude system ) that they are very easy to comprehend and synthesize from theory .",
    "the version of the @xmath0-correction code ( v1_11 ) implementing the calculations described here , along with eigentemplates and filter curves , is publicly available on the world wide web at http://physics.nyu.edu/  mb144/kcorrect .",
    "the whole of the code can be used through the research systems , incorporated , idl language ; everything except for the template - fitting also exists in stand - alone c programs ( which call the same routines , guaranteeing consistency ) .",
    "in this section we describe how we applied the above method to the sdss data set .",
    "the sdss ( @xcite ) is producing imaging and spectroscopic surveys over @xmath87 steradians in the northern galactic cap . a dedicated 2.5 m telescope ( siegmund _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) at apache point observatory , sunspot , new mexico , images the sky in five bands between 3000 and 10000   ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath39 , @xmath9 ; @xcite ) using a drift - scanning , mosaic ccd camera ( @xcite ) , detecting objects to a flux limit of @xmath91 .",
    "the ultimate goal is to spectroscopically observe main sample galaxies 900,000 galaxies ( down to @xmath92 ; @xcite ) , 100,000 luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; @xcite ) , and 100,000 qsos ( @xcite ; newberg _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) .",
    "this spectroscopic follow up uses two digital spectrographs on the same telescope as the imaging camera .",
    "many of the details of the galaxy survey are described in a description of the galaxy target selection paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "other aspects of the survey are described in the early data release ( edr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the photometric pipeline for all of the galaxies were extracted from the sdss operational database .",
    "the photometry used here for the bulk of these objects was the same as that used when the objects were targeted .",
    "however , for those objects which were in the edr photometric catalog , we used the better calibrations and photometry from the edr .",
    "the versions of the sdss pipeline photo used for the reductions of these data ranged from v5_0 to v5_2 .",
    "the treatment of relatively small galaxies , which account for most of our sample , did not change substantially throughout these versions . as described in @xcite ,",
    "magnitudes are calibrated to a standard star network approximately in the @xmath11 system , described in section [ motivation ] .",
    "the response functions @xmath17 of the filter - ccd combinations have been measured using a monochrometer by mamoru doi . using a model for the atmospheric transmission and the reflectivity of the primary and secondary mirrors , one can then model the response of the entire system .",
    "for each bandpass in the sdss , there are six different ccds ; it has been shown that the differences are small between these ccd and filter responses for each bandpass .",
    "the resulting set of filter curves is shown in figure [ response_sdss ] , in comparison to a model of a galaxy spectral energy distribution observed at @xmath86 ( a 4 gyr old instantaneous burst from the models of @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the spectroscopic observations are treated as follows .",
    "we extract one - dimensional spectra from the two - dimension images using a pipeline ( specbs v4_8 ) created specifically for the sdss instrumentation ( @xcite ) , which also fits for the redshift of each spectrum .",
    "the official sdss redshifts are obtained from a different pipeline ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two independent versions provide a consistency check on the redshift determination , and for galaxies they agree on more than 99% of the objects .",
    "we use two types of magnitudes determined by the sdss .",
    "first , the sdss petrosian magnitudes , a modified form of the magnitude described by @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "petrosian magnitudes are circular aperture magnitudes with an aperture size which is determined by the shape of the radial profile ( not its amplitude ) .",
    "the resulting apertures are empirically nearly constant in metric size as a function of redshift ; in addition , all the bands use the same aperture , so the measured sed corresponds ( to within the effects of seeing ) to the sed of an identifiable region of the galaxy .",
    "however , for faint objects , the petrosian magnitudes tend to become noisy .",
    "thus , for galaxies with @xmath93 we instead use the higher signal - to - noise `` model magnitudes .",
    "'' model magnitudes are calculated in all bands using a single weighted aperture convolved with the point spread function ; thus , the measured colors again correspond to an identifiable region of the galaxy , though a different one than would be measured by the petrosian magnitude . the weighted aperture is the better fitting model ( pure exponential or pure de vaucouleurs ) to the galaxy image in the @xmath90-band .",
    "thus , the model magnitudes weight the centers of galaxies more strongly than do petrosian magnitudes .",
    "in @xcite we are explicitly warned not to mix petrosian and model magnitudes in a single analysis , since they measure galaxies in very different ways .",
    "nevertheless , for the purposes of contraining galaxy template seds , it is perfectly acceptable to use _ any _ well - defined part of any galaxy . for our purposes , it is more important to have high signal - to - noise measurements of galaxy colors than to measure exactly the same regions of galaxies at low and high redshift .",
    "we extinction - correct both types of magnitudes using the dust maps of @xcite .      for the purposes of using the sdss data to constrain our template set , we take a subsample of the data consisting of around 30,000 objects in the range @xmath94 .",
    "the sample includes both the main sample and the lrgs , and is designed such that there is an approximately even distribution over redshift within our range of redshifts . in addition , we add results from galaxies in several spectroscopic plates ( totalling about 1,000 objects ) which were selected by a photometric redshift algorithm ( csabai _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) to be at around @xmath95@xmath96 , and subsequently observed spectroscopically .",
    "these objects are invaluable for tying down the blue end of the templates .",
    "finally , we exclude galaxies in the redshift range @xmath97 from the fit for the templates , for reasons which we will explain more fully below ( nevertheless , we still can and do use the resulting templates to analyze galaxies in this range )",
    ".    some of the objects have missing or poorly constrained data .",
    "for example , the @xmath88- or @xmath9-band fluxes for some objects are swamped by the photon noise of the sky .",
    "we identify such cases as magnitude errors greater than 2.0 or magnitudes fainter than 24.0 in any band .",
    "we ignore these objects entirely when fitting for the templates .",
    "in addition , the photometric errors for most objects in the spectroscopic galaxy sample of the sdss are not dominated by the estimated errors on the photometry listed in the catalog . instead , the errors are dominated by local calibration errors and other systematic effects , which are poorly known . to account for these errors ,",
    "we add extra error terms in quadrature with the errors listed in the catalog ( 0.05 mags , 0.02 mags , 0.02 mags , 0.02 mags , and 0.03 mags for @xmath98 , respectively ) .",
    "the choice of these values is based on a qualitative sense of the photometric errors present in the data .",
    "not accounting for this extra source of errors can cause the fits to be ill - behaved .",
    "for the sed space ( our @xmath28 ) , we use the subspace defined by ten bruzual - charlot instantaneous burst models with ages ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath100 years , five with metallicity @xmath101 and five with @xmath102 , all assuming a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "since we can not recover information about the sed below a certain wavelength resolution , we smooth most of the wavelength regime of the templates using a gaussian with a standard deviation of @xmath103 ; for the region of the spectrum which contains the sharpest gradients , around 4000 , we smooth only with @xmath104 .",
    "none of our results change dramatically if we vary our smoothing procedure or if we add reddened templates to our allowed sed space .",
    "we choose to fit for @xmath105 eigentemplates , the maximum one can use and still allow freedom to fit for the templates themselves . simply using five templates ( which obviously reproduces all the magnitudes exactly ) tends to yield unphysical trends of galaxy sed versus redshift ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure [ main_colors_plot ] below ) . using three templates does nearly as well as four templates in the sense that the resulting templates reproduce the @xmath106 magnitudes nearly as well .",
    "however , the fourth template is necessary to recover the @xmath88-band flux to better than about 15% .",
    "in addition , since one of the applications of these sed determinations is the distribution of galaxy colors in fixed frame magnitudes , we do nt want to artificially reduce the dimensionality of the color space to only two .",
    "one more choice needs to be made , the wavelength regime over which to orthogonalize the templates and over which to calculate the flux .",
    "we choose the range defined by @xmath107  and @xmath108 , since this rest frame range is observed for almost all galaxies in the sample .",
    "we refer here and in other papers to the flux and luminosity in this range as the `` visual flux '' @xmath109 and the `` visual luminosity '' @xmath110 .",
    "once we have finished fitting for the templates , we still want to determine a best - fit sed for each object .",
    "thus , after the templates have been determined , we fit for the coefficients @xmath111 for each galaxy , including those excluded from the template - fitting procedure because of large errors . in order to accommodate the presence of errors ,",
    "we constrain all the sed fits to all galaxies using the method described in section [ direct ] . as a constraint",
    ", we use the covariance matrix and mean value ( essentially zero , by design ) of the coefficients of the well - measured set of galaxies used to determine the templates ; we multiply all the elements of the covariance matrix by a factor of four to weaken our constraint ( which is appropriate , since the actual distribution of coefficients is not well described by a single gaussian ) .",
    "thus , we account for any missing information by simply requiring that the object sed have `` reasonable '' properties .",
    "the constraint does not affect the results for galaxies which have well - measured magnitudes in all bands .      in figure [ response_sdss ]",
    ", there is clearly a gap between the @xmath89 and @xmath90 bands .",
    "linear fits to the data allow considerable freedom in the resulting reconstructed seds .",
    "as it happens , one of the directions in our best fit coefficient space @xmath59 corresponds to a large spike at around 4000  ; that this direction is important is not surprising , since one of the most variable quantities of galaxy seds is the size of the 4000   break .",
    "however , the gap between the @xmath89 and @xmath90 bands corresponds to the 4000   break at around @xmath112 .",
    "the existence of this spike in one direction in our four - dimensional space means that galaxies at @xmath112 can vary along this direction in order to better fit @xmath88 , @xmath39 , and @xmath9 , with little effect on the @xmath113 color of the fit .",
    "this results in unphysical sed fits to galaxies near @xmath112 .",
    "one really only needs to worry about this effect in the sdss when one is dealing with the lrgs , for galaxies in the range about @xmath114 .",
    "the main sample results are not significantly affected at all ( since few main sample galaxies are at @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , one can still observe a galaxy at @xmath115 and reliably infer what it would look like at @xmath112 ; it is only the reverse process which is difficult .    to demonstrate this",
    "degeneracy , figure [ spur ] shows the spectrum corresponding to the direction represented by the vector @xmath116 , for our best fit templates .",
    "we overplot the @xmath117 and @xmath118 bands .",
    "this direction has a strong peak in the gap between the two bands at @xmath112 .",
    "this difficulty is why , in section [ data ] , we exclude the regime around @xmath95 ; otherwise the templates became distracted by the degeneracies in this range .",
    "we have explored using a larger set of input spectra , by including reddened versions of all our templates , to test whether a more complete space of seds would cause our fit to choose a more realistic subspace .",
    "in addition , we have tried removing the increased resolution of the template seds around the 4000   break .",
    "neither of these tests yielded better results .",
    "our opinion is that the ideal regularization which would solve this problem would be to minimize @xmath49 under the constraint that none of the original bruzual - charlot spectra defining our sed space contribute negatively to the sed fit .",
    "such a solution would almost certainly have better properties than our linear approach here : it would almost certainly avoid the degeneracies , it would yield reasonable fit sed over a larger wavelength range , it would associate a reasonable star - formation history with each object ( which could be used to evolution - correct the magnitudes ) .",
    "however , we have not tackled this approach yet .",
    "as it happens , the direct constraint on the coefficients described in the previous section is sufficient to suppress the @xmath89/@xmath90 gap problem for many purposes , as long as one @xmath0-corrects the magnitudes to @xmath112 . in this way",
    ", one minimizes the @xmath0-corrections for the galaxies which one is least certain of .",
    "the top two panels of figure [ k_coeffdist_plot ] show the pairwise joint distributions of @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 for a random subset of about 10,000 of the galaxies in the sdss sample ( not only the ones which we used to fit the templates ) . in the bottom panel , three spectra taken from a one - dimensional sequence along the galaxy locus",
    "are shown , showing that the spectra become progressively bluer along that sequence .",
    "note that constraints on the sed become poor at the bluest and reddest edges of this diagram ( the peak of the @xmath9-band response is at 8700  rest frame for a galaxy observed at @xmath86 ) .",
    "therefore , the odd behavior near the edges should not be taken too seriously .",
    "in addition , note the small spur extending from lower left to upper right through the right edge of the ( @xmath121)-(@xmath120 ) plane .",
    "many of the objects in this spur are at around @xmath112 , and this spur is the result of the degeneracy due to the @xmath89/@xmath90 gap .",
    "these reconstructed spectra do an excellent job of reproducing the observed galaxy fluxes .",
    "figure [ k_model_plot ] shows the differences between the observed and reconstructed fluxes as a function of redshift .",
    "there are no systematic trends with redshift , and the standard deviations of the differences between the observed and the reconstructed fluxes ( shown on the right bottom corner of each panel ) are of order the photometric errors in the sample .",
    "in particular , for our 30,000 galaxies ( and thus approximately 30,000 degrees of freedom ) we find @xmath122 , indicating that our fit is reasonable .",
    "an important test of the consistency of the fits is to check that for a fixed type of galaxy , the distribution of the fixed frame colors depends only weakly on redshift . because the galaxies shown in figures [ k_coeffdist_plot ] and [ k_model_plot ] are inhomogeneously selected",
    " some are main sample galaxies , some are lrgs , and some are selected from the photometric redshift plates  we will split our sample into two well - defined sets of objects to perform this test .",
    "first , we choose a set of main sample galaxies in the luminosity range @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ main_colors_plot.z ] shows the observed - frame colors of all the galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "the right - hand panels show the distribution for redshifts @xmath124 ( solid histogram ) and @xmath125 ( dotted histogram ) .",
    "a trend exists in all colors , most strongly in @xmath126 .",
    "figure [ main_colors_plot ] shows the @xmath0-corrected colors @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 in the same manner . the plots show a general consistency in the fixed frame color distribution of these objects with redshift .",
    "small changes are discernible in the distributions , mostly attributable to the increased errors at higher redshift .",
    "note that for @xmath131 the @xmath127 color depends on an extrapolation of the sed in the blue , while for @xmath132 the @xmath130 color depends on an extrapolation of the sed in the red .",
    "second , we choose a set of cut i lrgs ( see @xcite for details ) with @xmath133 .",
    "figure [ lrg_colors_plot.z ] shows the observed colors as a function of redshift for these objects .",
    "again , there is a strong redshift dependence .",
    "figure [ lrg_colors_plot ] shows the colors @xmath0-corrected to @xmath112 , which appear approximately constant with redshift .",
    "@xmath134 ( which is very similar to @xmath135 ) experiences a blueward shift of about 0.1 magnitudes between @xmath115 and @xmath136 , which is attributable to passive evolution , though it could also be due to the lrg selection procedure .    in short , these fits to galaxy seds provide estimates which reproduce the galaxy photometry nearly to the level of the errors in the photometry itself , seem physically reasonable , and are consistent over the range of redshifts we consider ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "we show , in figure [ k_kcorrect_plot ] , the resulting @xmath0-corrections to @xmath112 inferred from this method , for all five sdss bands .",
    "note that the @xmath0-corrections are largest ( and thus most uncertain ) in @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "remember that the @xmath0-corrections to @xmath138 are extrapolations for @xmath140 and that the @xmath0-corrections to @xmath141 are extrapolations for @xmath142 , so those results should not be taken too seriously .",
    "( although the @xmath0-corrections given are not _ too _ unreasonable ) .",
    "an important test of our method is to synthesize broad band photometry from spectra , and then try to recover the @xmath0-corrections in a case where we know the spectrum completely . for this purpose , we use as example spectra the spectra of galaxies in the sdss . since we can not synthesize the observed @xmath88 and @xmath9 bands from these spectra , we simply base them on the synthesized @xmath89 and @xmath39 band magnitudes plus the actual @xmath143 and @xmath144 colors .",
    "( this procedure is unlikely to make the photometric estimations of the @xmath0-corrections _ better _ ) .",
    "finally , we added 2% random errors to all of the measurements .",
    "figure [ k_speck_plot.fitfib.0.1 ] compares the @xmath0-corrections from the synthesized photometry to that calculated from the spectrum itself : @xmath145 since all of the photometry used in this test is actually synthesized from the spectra , this is _ not _ a comparison of photometric and spectroscopic @xmath0-corrections ; it is _ only _ a test of how well our method recovers @xmath0-corrections .",
    "the agreement in figure [ k_speck_plot.fitfib.0.1 ] is very good , suggesting that our method can indeed recover the correct @xmath0-corrections based only on broad band magnitudes .    to test",
    "how robust these @xmath0-correction results are to our model assumptions , we compare them to other methods of calculating fixed frame galaxy magnitudes . an extremely simple method is to calculate the flux in any desired bandpass by fitting a power - law slope and amplitude to the fluxes in the two adjacent bandpasses ( extrapolating when necessary ) .",
    "figure [ compareci ] shows the differences in the @xmath0-corrections inferred from this method and those inferred from the method of figure [ k_kcorrect_plot ] , as a function of redshift .",
    "@xmath90 , @xmath39 , and @xmath9 are all reasonably similar in either method ; @xmath88 and @xmath89 , however , have distinct trends with redshift , mostly due to the non - power law nature of the template galaxy spectra ( and probably actual galaxy spectra ) in this regime .",
    "to show this fact , we perform a similar power - law fit , only this time including a break in the spectrum at 4000  .",
    "we use the @xmath88-@xmath89 color to fit the break , assuming that the slope blueward of 4000   is @xmath146 .",
    "figure [ comparecibreak ] shows the results of this fit ; the redshift trend in @xmath89 is greatly reduced , as is the trend in @xmath88 , but a large amount of scatter remains in the @xmath88 band .",
    "this results from the fact that you can _ either _ fit the slope of the sed below the 4000   break _ or _ the size of the 4000   break itself ; it is not possible with this data to constrain both in an individual spectrum , which is a limitation of our determination of fixed frame @xmath88-band magnitudes .",
    "finally , it is possible to use the galaxy spectra obtained with the spectrograph to estimate the @xmath0-correction for each object .",
    "however , this procedure requires trusting the spectrophotometry over a wide wavelength range . in addition , the region of the galaxy which the spectra cover is not completely well defined .",
    "the small scale wavelength features are set by the fiber aperture ( @xmath147 in diameter ) while large scale wavelength features are constrained by a short `` smear exposure '' which covers a larger area .",
    "the smear exposure corrections are clearly the correct approach for point sources , but for galaxies it causes the small scale and large scale features of the spectrum to be determined by somewhat different regions of the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , in figure [ k_speck_plot.0.1 ] , we compare the @xmath0-corrections to @xmath115 of main sample galaxies calculated based on the spectra to those of figure [ k_kcorrect_plot ] , finding that they are quite similar . there is a trend with redshift in the @xmath89-band , which is due to the fact that on average the @xmath113 color is about 0.1 magnitudes redder in the fiber aperture than in the petrosian aperture .",
    "the implication is that the @xmath0-corrections are stronger for the aperture which corresponds to the spectrum than for the petrosian aperture .",
    "this indicates that for work which requires precision , it is best to avoid using the @xmath0-corrections determined from the spectra .",
    "( note that in the second paragraph of this section we used the sdss spectra as _",
    "spectra to validate the method as applied to synthesized photometry ; in this paragraph we have evaluated whether to rely on fiber spectra to calculate @xmath0-corrections for the petrosian photometry ) .    for completeness , figure [ k_speck_plot.0.3 ] compares the spectroscopic and photometric @xmath0-corrections to @xmath112 of lrgs .",
    "the @xmath118 and @xmath148 bands agree very well .",
    "however , there is considerable scatter in the @xmath117 band ( nearly equivalent to the @xmath149 band ) , at around 20% . because the lrgs tend to have small color gradients , the issues of fiber sizes and smear exposures are not important in this context .",
    "we have presented a method and an implementation for estimating galaxy seds for the purpose of calculating fixed frame galaxy magnitudes over a range of redshifts .",
    "we have demonstrated that it gives sensible and consistent results .",
    "we will be using this method in future papers which will describe the joint distribution of luminosities and colors of galaxies , as well as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we plan to incorporate observations of objects in bands other than the sdss bands to further describe the nature of galaxy seds .",
    "we have not discussed in detail the question of error analysis .",
    "there is no answer to this question which is simple , general , _ and _ realistic .",
    "the photometric errors can of course be propagated to the errors on the reconstructed magnitudes , but these estimates do not describe the errors associated with the restriction to a three - dimensional space of sed shapes .",
    "an idea of the level of errors can be gleaned from the comparison of our method to other methods of @xmath0-correction .",
    "clearly , @xmath90 , @xmath39 and @xmath9 can be reconstructed to the level of the photometry .",
    "judging from figure [ k_speck_plot.fitfib.0.1 ] , the @xmath89 band can be reconstructed to about 5% accuracy .",
    "the @xmath88 band is more difficult to evaluate .",
    "judging from the poor reconstructions of the @xmath139 band ( nearly equal to the @xmath150 band , the reconstructions may be as bad as 20% accuracy .",
    "topics we have not discussed here are dust- and evolution - correction of the magnitudes .",
    "some of the scatter in the three - dimensional space describing the shape of the galaxy sed is probably due to dust . it may be possible to evaluate the effects of reddening in this space and , by assuming that galaxies corrected for internal reddening live in an even lower dimensional space , perform a reddening correction .",
    "we will be investigating this question in the near future .",
    "one can perform a similar exercise with evolution estimates , relating the position of a galaxy along the @xmath151 axis in figure [ k_coeffdist_plot ] to a particular star - formation history , and estimating the evolution of the object from that history .    the distribution of galaxies in the three - dimensional space of galaxy seds described here may be useful for other purposes , as well .",
    "for example , you can calculate photometric redshifts using the method described here .",
    "kcorrect v1_11 has a simple ( and very fast ) photometric redshift estimator with very tight core of residuals ( @xmath152 ) in a comparison to sdss galaxies with redshifts .",
    "however , we warn the reader that before this code can be used as a reliable photometric redshift indicator , more work has to be done ( which the reader is invited to do using the released code ) to identify galaxies which are likely to be redshift outliers and to handle galaxies at @xmath153 ( which have photometric observations which are bluer in the rest frame than for any galaxies in our training set ) . until this method is perfect and our templates are better constrained , we recommend the photometric redshift method and results of csabai _ et al . _ , in preparation .",
    "another use of the three - dimensional space of galaxy seds is to create mock samples of galaxies observed in any bandpass at any redshift .",
    "we are working on quantifying the correlations between these coefficients and luminosity , surface - brighntess and radial profile in order to create mock catalogs which truly reflect the correlations between galaxy properties found in the data .",
