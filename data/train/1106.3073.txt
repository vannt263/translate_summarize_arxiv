    "the association of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with type ic supernovae ( sne ) provides the most direct evidence for massive stripped - envelope ( wolf - rayet ) stars as the progenitors of long grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this connection was first intimated by the discovery of the unusually luminous and broad - lined type ic sn1998bw ( @xmath13 mpc ) in spatial and temporal coincidence with grb980425 @xcite .",
    "it was further supported by the detection of late - time photometric `` bumps '' in the optical light curves of several grbs at @xmath14 that resembled the optical light curve of sn1998bw ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although alternative explanations for these bumps have been proposed @xcite .",
    "subsequently , unambiguous spectroscopic identifications were obtained for four nearby grbs : grb030329/sn2003dh ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) , grb031203/sn2003lw ( @xmath16 ; @xcite ) , xrf060218/sn2006aj ( @xmath17 ; @xcite ) , and grb100316d / sn2010bh ( @xmath18 ; @xcite ) .",
    "all four events are broad - lined type ic sne , similar to sn1998bw .",
    "however , only grb030329 is typical of the cosmological long grb population in terms of its energy scale @xcite , while the remaining three events are all sub - energetic in @xmath19-rays , have no clear optical afterglows , exhibit only mildly relativistic velocities , and appear to be quasi - spherical ( the so - called sub - energetic grbs ; @xcite ) .    as a result",
    ", there is a clear impetus to obtain spectroscopic observations of grb - sne at @xmath12 to bolster the grb - sn connection for the cosmological population , as well as to map the range of grb - sn properties ( i.e. , velocity , kinetic energy , ejecta mass , @xmath20 mass ) , and to compare the properties of the sne associated with standard and sub - energetic grbs .",
    "the challenge of obtaining such spectroscopic observations is twofold .",
    "first , the associated sne are faint , with a peak optical apparent brightness of @xmath21 mag at @xmath22 and @xmath23 mag at @xmath24 .",
    "second , at these redshifts the brightness of the sne and the compact host galaxies are similar , therefore requiring a careful subtraction of the host spectrum to robustly reveal and properly measure the sn features .    to date ,",
    "spectroscopic observations timed to coincide with potential grb - sne at @xmath25 have been obtained in five cases .",
    "@xcite obtained a spectrum of grb021211 ( @xmath26 ) during the peak of an associated bump ( designated sn2002lt ) .",
    "the putative sn and host galaxy had a comparable brightness of @xmath27 mag , but the host contribution was not subtracted from the spectrum , which appears to exhibit a broad minimum interpreted as h&k blue - shifted by about @xmath28 km s@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite claim a close match with the normal type ic sn1994i , but a poor match with sn1998bw ; however , inspection of their figure 2 shows that the peculiar type ia sn1991bg is an equally good match to the noisy spectrum of the putative sn2002lt .",
    "@xcite obtained a spectrum of grb011121 ( @xmath29 ) coincident with the peak of an associated bump ( designated sn2001ke ) when the optical brightness was @xmath30 mag .",
    "unlike sn1998bw , the resulting spectrum is flat at @xmath31  , which @xcite claim as evidence for a type iin event .",
    "however , the large , and uncertain , extinction along this line - of - sight may influence this result . a spectrum of xrf020903 ( @xmath32 )",
    "was obtained by @xcite during a late flattening in the light curve . after subtraction of a model starburst galaxy template ,",
    "the residual spectrum exhibits an overall shape similar to sn1998bw .",
    "@xcite obtained a spectrum of grb050525a ( @xmath33 ) about 2 weeks after the peak of the associated bump ( designated sn2005nc ) , with equal contribution from the putative sn and host galaxy ( each with @xmath27 mag ) .",
    "after subtraction of a model host spectrum , the residual spectrum exhibits a broad bump at @xmath34  , with a decline at longer wavelengths , broadly resembling the spectrum of sn1998bw .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of grb101219b ( @xmath35 based on weak absorption ) about 16 and 37 d after the burst and find broad undulations that resemble sn1998bw and distinct from an earlier featureless spectrum . they do not directly account for the spectral shape of the host galaxy , assuming instead a flat spectrum . in none of the 5 cases was an attempt made to extract any sn properties beyond addressing whether or not they resembled sn1998bw .    here",
    "we present spectroscopic observations of grb091127 at @xmath0 , timed to coinciding with the peak of a photometric bump designated sn2009nz @xcite .",
    "the bump light curve resembles sn1998bw , albeit dimmer by about 0.1 mag and with a somewhat earlier peak and narrower light curve ; it is brighter than sn2006aj by about 0.25 mag , with a later peak and broader light curve @xcite . at the peak of the bump , the sn brightness is @xmath36 mag , the afterglow is estimated to be @xmath37 mag , and the host galaxy has @xmath38 mag ( i.e. , the relative contributions are about @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , as in the previous cases of @xmath12 bumps , the host and putative supernova contribute a similar amount of flux , thereby requiring a careful subtraction of the host galaxy spectrum . here",
    "we undertake this procedure using a spectrum of the host galaxy obtained about 1 yr after the burst (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "subtraction of the host contribution cleanly isolates the sn spectrum and reveals broad undulations that clearly resemble previous grb - sne , in particular sn2006aj and potentially sn2003dh , but with narrower features than sn1998bw and sn2010bh (  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "this result demonstrates that the photometric bump is indeed a sn , and allows us to extract the explosion properties of sn2009nz (  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we compare these properties to the well - studied nearby grb - sne to explore the dispersion of sn properties for standard and sub - energetic grbs (  [ sec : conc ] ) .",
    "we observed grb091127 ( @xmath0 ; @xcite ) with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) on the gemini - north 8-m telescope ( program gn-2009b - q-28 , pi : fox ) on 2009 december 22.27 ut .",
    "the spectrum was timed to coincide with the peak of an associated sn1998bw - like event at @xmath0 .",
    "two dithered 900 s exposure pairs were obtained with the r400 grating at central wavelengths of 8000 and 8050   in @xmath42 seeing .",
    "the resulting combined spectrum covers @xmath43   at a resolution of about 7  .",
    "an og515 order - blocking filter was used to prevent second - order contamination in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "the spectra were reduced , combined , and extracted using standard procedures in iraf , while flux calibration and correction for telluric absorption were performed using custom idl routines with archival observations of the standard stars bd+284211 and feige34 .",
    "the mean airmass of the observation was 1.3 and the @xmath44 slit was aligned at the parallactic angle , so the relative spectral shape is reliable .",
    "we determine the overall flux scale of the spectrum by integrating over the @xmath45-band filter response function and comparing to photometry of the target in the gmos @xmath45-band acquisition image within the same aperture size ( @xmath46 mag calibrated relative to follow up observations from magellan  see  [ sec : magellan ] ) .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric observations of the host galaxy of were obtained with the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) mounted on the magellan / baade 6.5-m telescope on the nights of 2010 november 13 and 14 ut .",
    "we obtained two 2400 s exposures with the 200 l / mm grism using a @xmath47 slit and a 4950   order blocking filter to avoid second - order contamination in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "the seeing during the observations was @xmath48 , well - matched to the conditions of the gmos spectrum .",
    "the spectra were processed using standard procedures in iraf , and the wavelength calibration was performed using henear arc lamps .",
    "the resulting wavelength coverage is @xmath49  , with a resolution of about 4.7  .",
    "flux calibration was performed using observations of the spectrophotometric standard star feige110 .",
    "we confirmed the overall flux calibration and shape by integrating the spectrum over the @xmath45- and @xmath50-band filter response functions ( @xmath51 mag , @xmath52 mag ) compared to photometric measurements of the host within the same aperture size ( @xmath51 mag , @xmath53 mag ) .",
    "the photometric observations were obtained in the @xmath54 filters .",
    "the data were processed using standard procedures in iraf , and photometric calibration was performed using observations of the southern standard star field e3a .",
    "the resulting flux measurements ( in a @xmath55 radius aperture ) are provided in table  [ tab : photom ] .",
    "we note that our @xmath50-band measurement is in excellent agreement with the @xmath56-band host flux given in @xcite .",
    "the spectra at the peak of the photometric bump and of the host galaxy alone are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the bump spectrum ( supernova+host ) exhibits broad undulations with a peak at @xmath57  , and a possible second peak at @xmath58  .",
    "these features are reminiscent of previous grb - sne , but it is critical to ensure that they do not result from host galaxy contamination , since the host contributes about half of the total flux . to remove any possible contamination , and to cleanly isolate the sn features , we subtract the host spectrum from the bump spectrum and find that the features are robustly detected . the isolated spectrum of the transient exhibits three absorption troughs centered at rest wavelengths of about 4200 , 4750 , and 6000  , closely matching the spectra of nearby grb - sne .",
    "the 4200 and 4750   features are generally identified as blends of / and / , respectively , while the 6000   feature is identified as @xmath59 .",
    "we confirmed these results by subtracting a scaled blue galaxy template spectrum obtained from the sloan digital sky survey cross - correlation library ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the galaxy spectral shape is essentially identical to our measurements , and the resulting isolated sn spectrum reveals the same features detected in the subtraction relative to the magellan host spectrum . in the analysis below we use the sn spectrum from the actual host subtraction , but note that the results are unchanged for the spectrum from template subtraction .",
    "we compare our sn2009nz spectrum at @xmath60 d ( corresponding to @xmath61 d past maximum light ; @xcite ) to the spectra of the nearby grb - sne 1998bw , 2003dh , 2006aj , and 2010bh on a similar timescale ( figure  [ fig : comp1 ] ) .",
    "overall , the spectrum of sn2009nz is remarkably similar to the nearby grb - sne , exhibiting the same broad features that are a hallmark of large expansion velocities .",
    "this unambiguously identifies the photometric bump associated with  as a supernova , and demonstrates that sn2009nz is also a broad - lined event , likely of type ic .",
    "we do not find a prominent @xmath62 absorption feature as expected for a type ib sn . finally , a comparison to the normal type ic sn1994i and the normal type ib sn1998dt reveals a poor match due to their significantly narrower features .    among the sample of nearby grb - sne the best overall",
    "match to sn2009nz is provided by sn2006aj , in terms of both the location of the absorption minima and the width of the features ( figure  [ fig : comp1 ] ) .",
    "sn2003dh also provides a reasonable match , but sne 1998bw and 2010bh have significantly broader features indicative of larger expansion velocities .",
    "we estimate the photospheric velocity using the location of the @xmath59 absorption feature ( figure  [ fig : comp3 ] ) .",
    "we find that the for sn2009nz the minimum is located at @xmath63   ( with an uncertainty of about 50  ) , corresponding to a velocity of about @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ( with an uncertainty of about 2500 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "a comparison to the inferred @xmath2 velocities of the previous grb - sne @xcite indeed indicates a similar velocity to sn2006aj ( @xmath64 km s@xmath4 ) , and lower velocity than sn1998bw ( @xmath65 km s@xmath4 ) and sn2010bh ( @xmath66 km s@xmath4 ) .    using the photospheric velocity from our spectrum , along with the peak brightness ( @xmath67 ) and width of the photometric light curve ( parametrized as @xmath68 )",
    ", we can determine the basic explosion properties of sn2009nz , namely the kinetic energy ( @xmath69 ) , the ejecta mass ( @xmath11 ) , and the mass of synthesized @xmath70 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the light curve presented in @xcite indicates @xmath71 mag and @xmath72 mag . using the formulation of @xcite , based on the theoretical model of @xcite",
    ", we infer @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( here @xmath75 is the ejecta mass in units of solar masses and @xmath76 is the kinetic energy in units of @xmath77 erg ) . from our inferred velocity",
    "we also find @xmath78 , and therefore @xmath79 and @xmath80 . as with the overall shape of the spectrum",
    ", the inferred explosions properties of sn2009nz most closely resemble those of sn2006aj , for which @xcite estimated @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "on the other hand , they are significantly lower than for sne 1998bw and 2003lw ; see table  [ tab : exp ] and figure  [ fig : exp_prop ] .",
    "the maximal values of the explosion properties given the uncertainties in @xmath67 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are : @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we presented a spectrum of the photometric bump ( designated sn2009nz ) associated with the standard cosmological , and unambiguously demonstrated that it is a broad - lined sn , similar to the type ic sne associated with nearby grbs .",
    "the best match over the wavelength range of our spectrum ( @xmath89  ) is provided by sn2006aj ; sne 1998bw and 2010bh , on the other hand , exhibit broader features indicative of larger expansion velocities . identifying the absorption feature centered at @xmath90   with @xmath2",
    ", we infer a photospheric velocity about @xmath91 km s@xmath4 at @xmath92 d , similar to that of sn2006aj , and lower than sne 1998bw and 2010bh .",
    "combined with the sn light curve properties , we find that the explosion properties of sn2009nz are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath73 , similar to those of sn2006aj .",
    "these results demonstrate that beyond the basic need to spectroscopically confirm photometric bumps as supernovae , spectroscopy of grb - sne at @xmath12 provides two key measurements .",
    "first , the spectra allow us to determine the sn type .",
    "to date , all the nearby well - studied grb - sne have been classified as broad - lined type ic events . at @xmath12",
    "there are claims for a normal type ic event ( grb021211/sn2002lt ; @xcite ) and a type iin event ( grb011121/sn2001ke ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , both of these claims are problematic : sn2002lt equally resembles the peculiar type ia sn1991bg , while sn2001ke suffers from large , and uncertain , extinction leading to an uncertain spectral shape .",
    "in addition , in neither case was the host contribution accounted for , leading to possible contamination of the spectra .",
    "the remaining three events at @xmath12 with spectroscopic observations ( xrf020903 , grb050525a , and grb101219b ) broadly resemble sn1998bw @xcite , but no attempt has been made to extract their physical properties .",
    "here , we find that sn2009nz is also a broad - lined event , but for the first time have a sufficiently large comparison sample to demonstrate a closer similarity to sn2006aj than to the canonical sn1998bw .",
    "second , the spectra allow us to measure the photospheric velocity and , along with the light curve properties , to infer the basic explosion parameters ( the light curve by itself only provides a ratio of the kinetic energy and ejecta mass ) .",
    "thus , spectroscopy provides deeper insight into the physical properties of grb - sne than light curves alone . here , for the first time , we measured the expansion velocity and explosion properties of a grb - sn at @xmath95 . using these measurements",
    "we find that sn2009nz follows the overall trend of lower @xmath9 for events with lower @xmath10 and @xmath11 seen in the nearby grb - sne ( figure  [ fig : exp_prop ] ) .    in the same vein ,",
    "the similarity in spectral and explosion properties of sn2009nz and sn2006aj is instructive in light of the differences between the prompt emission properties of grb091127 and xrf060218 .",
    "the former is a typical cosmological grb with @xmath1 erg , a duration of @xmath96 s , and a rest - frame @xmath97 kev @xcite , while the latter is an x - ray flash with @xmath98 erg , a duration of @xmath99 s , and a rest - frame @xmath100 kev @xcite .",
    "these differences provide evidence for a lack of correlation between the prompt emission and associated sn properties .",
    "moreover , @xcite suggested that xrf060218/sn2006aj was powered by a neutron star instead of a black hole based on the lower ejecta mass and kinetic energy compared to sne 1998bw , 2003dh , and 2003lw , as well as the low energy of the prompt emission .",
    "however , grb091127 is typical of the cosmological grb population , which is thought to be powered by black holes @xcite , and yet its associated sn2009nz shares the properties of sn2006aj .",
    "this either casts doubt on the idea that the properties of sn2006aj ( or of grb - sne in general ) require a neutron star central engine , or alternatively suggests that standard grbs can be powered by either neutron stars or black holes , but with no clear imprint on the prompt emission properties .    from an observational point of view",
    ", we stress that while the broad sn features are identifiable in the bump ( supernova+host ) spectrum of sn2009nz , subtraction of the host spectrum provides a more reliable and robust identification of the sn features .",
    "accounting for the host contribution in grb - sn spectra at @xmath12 is critical since in all cases to date the host galaxy contributes about half of the observed flux .",
    "none of the studies published to date accounted for the actual host spectrum , either neglecting its contribution altogether ( grb021211 : @xcite ; grb011121 : @xcite ) , assuming a template blue galaxy spectrum ( grb050525a : @xcite ; xrf020903 : @xcite ) , or assuming a flat spectrum ( grb101219b : @xcite ) . in this study",
    "we find that either an actual spectrum of the host or an appropriate template matched to the host colors should be subtracted .",
    "we end by noting that the small sample of grb - sne with detailed spectroscopic observations already reveals a wide dispersion in explosion properties , with about a factor of 30 in @xmath69 , a factor of 15 in @xmath11 , and a factor of 7 in @xmath9 ( table  [ tab : exp ] and figure  [ fig : exp_prop ] ) .",
    "this also seems to be the case for the two events associated with standard grbs  grb030329/sn2003dh and grb091127/sn2009nz .",
    "the wide dispersion contradicts earlier claims for a narrow range of grb - sn properties , mainly their kinetic energies @xcite .",
    "clearly , a larger number of events is required to fully sample the range of explosion parameters , to evaluate whether there really exists a dispersion in grb - sn types , and to investigate any correlations with the grb properties or differences between the sne associated with sub - energetic and standard grbs .",
    "such a study requires a concerted effort to determine the afterglow properties from broad - band modeling , to measure the sn light curves , and to obtain spectra of the bumps and host galaxies . with a",
    "swift _ detection rate of @xmath101 @xmath22 grbs per year such a concerted effort is both desirable and achievable .",
