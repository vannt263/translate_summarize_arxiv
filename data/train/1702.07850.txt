    "in the framework of inflationary paradigm  @xcite , recent cosmological observations indicate that a very small relict vacuum energy ( equivalently , repulsive cosmological constant @xmath5 ) , or , generally , a dark energy demonstrating repulsive gravitational effect , has to be introduced to explain dynamics of the recent universe  @xcite .",
    "these conclusions are supported strongly by the observations of distant ia - type supernova explosions indicating that starting at the cosmological redshift @xmath6 expansion of the universe is accelerated  @xcite .",
    "the total energy density of the universe is very close to the critical energy density @xmath7 corresponding to almost flat universe predicted by the inflationary scenario  @xcite , and the dark energy represents about @xmath8 of the energy content of the observable universe @xcite .",
    "these conclusions are confirmed by recent measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropies by the space satellite observatory planck  @xcite .",
    "the dark energy equation of state is very close to those corresponding to the vacuum energy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is relevant to study the astrophysical consequences of the effect of the observed cosmological constant implied by the cosmological tests to be @xmath9 , and the related vacuum energy @xmath10 close to the critical density of the universe .",
    "the repulsive cosmological constant changes significantly the asymptotic structure of , naked singularity , or any compact - body backgrounds as such backgrounds become asymptotically spacetimes , and an event horizon ( cosmological horizon ) always exists , behind which the geometry is dynamic .    substantial influence of the repulsive cosmological constant has been demonstrated for astrophysical situations related to active galactic nuclei and their central supermassive black holes  @xcite .",
    "the black hole spacetimes with the @xmath11 term are described in the spherically symmetric case by the vacuum ( sds ) geometry @xcite , while the internal , uniform density sds spacetimes are given in  @xcite .",
    "the axially symmetric , rotating black holes are determined by the kerr - de sitter ( kds ) geometry @xcite . in the spacetimes with the repulsive cosmological term , motion of photons was extensively investigated in many papers  @xcite .",
    "the motion of massive test particles was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the kds geometry can be relevant also for the so called kerr superspinars representing an alternative to black holes  @xcite , breaking the black hole bound on the dimensionless spin and exhibiting a variety of unusual physical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the sds and kds spacetimes are equivalent to some solutions of the f(r ) gravity representing black holes and naked singularities @xcite .",
    "the role of the cosmological constant can be significant for both the geometrically thin keplerian accretion discs @xcite and the toroidal accretion discs  @xcite orbiting supermassive black holes ( kerr superspinars ) in the central parts of giant galaxies . both high - frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and jets originating at the accretion discs can be reflected by current carrying string loops in sds and kds spacetimes  @xcite . in the spherically",
    "symmetric spacetimes , the keplerian and toroidal disc structures can be precisely described the pseudo - newtonian potential of paczynski type  @xcite that appears to be useful also in studies of motion of interacting galaxies  @xcite demonstrating relation of the gravitationally bound galactic systems to the so called static radius of the sds or kds spacetimes @xcite .",

    "<S> we study general non - equatorial motion of photons in the kerr - de sitter black hole and naked singularity spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> the motion is governed by the impact parameter @xmath0 related to axial symmetry of the spacetime , and impact parameter @xmath1 related to its hidden symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> appropriate effective potentials governing the latitudinal and radial motion are introduced and their behaviour is examined by chinese boxes technique giving regions allowed for the motion in terms of the impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> limits on the impact parameter @xmath0 and @xmath1 are established in dependence on the spacetime parameters @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the motion can be of orbital type ( crossing the equatorial plane , @xmath3 ) and vortical type ( tied above or bellow the equatorial plane , @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for negative values of @xmath1 the reality conditions imposed on the latitudinal motion yield stronger constraints on the parameter @xmath0 than that following from the reality condition of motion in the radial direction , which , e. g. , exclude possibility of existence of vortical motion of constant radius . </S>",
    "<S> several other consequences are determined and a classification of  spacetimes reflecting the behaviour of the effective potentials is given . </S>"
