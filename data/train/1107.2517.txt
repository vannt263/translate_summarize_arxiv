    "this is an intriguing alternative to the more symmetric cubic symmetry , favored by the balance in electron energetics@xcite .",
    "the departure from higher symmetry has made it a semi - metal with a significant role in the history of metals physics ( for reviews see@xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it was in bismuth that a fermi surface was experimentally determined for the first time seventy years ago@xcite .",
    "this historical priority is not a consequence of intrinsic simplicity .",
    "the structure of fermi surface in bismuth is quite unlike the sphere seen in the opening chapters of a standard condensed - matter textbook on the free electron gas . on the other hand , and in spite of its complexity , this fermi surface is one of the easiest to detect by experiment . indeed , because of the lightness and high mobility of the carriers , quantum oscillations in bismuth are observable at relatively high temperatures and low magnetic fields .    during several decades , numerous investigations of the de haas - van alphen and",
    "shubnikov- de haas effects were carried on bismuth in order to pin down the fine details of the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "the well - established structure is sketched in fig.1 .",
    "it consists of one hole ellipsoid aligned perpendicular to the plane in which lay obliquely three slightly tilted@xcite electron ellipsoids .",
    "thanks to these intensive studies , the size of each ellipsoid and the tilt angle of the electron ellipsoids are known with a remarkable precision@xcite .    in parallel to these experiments",
    ", a number of band calculations have been reported@xcite . however , the relevant energy gap of the system is in the range of @xmath1 and therefore beneath the typical energy resolution of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the most successful band picture has been a tight - binding model using semi - empirical parameters@xcite .",
    "the results of this model are in rather good agreement with the details of the fermi surface according to the experiment .",
    "recently , there has been a renewal of interest in the electronic spectrum of bismuth , triggered by the relatively easy access it provides to the quantum limit@xcite and the presence of dirac fermions@xcite .",
    "the quantum limit is attained when the magnetic field is strong enough to confine electrons to their lowest landau level .",
    "for ordinary bulk metals , the size of the required magnetic field is well beyond the limits of current technology . in a low - density semi - metal such as bismuth ,",
    "on the other hand , a modest magnetic field applied along the high - symmetry axis known as the trigonal axis allows one to attain this limit .",
    "high - field experiments reporting peaks in the nernst coefficient@xcite , jumps in magnetization@xcite and hall plateaus@xcite raised the issue of collective effects in a three - dimensional electron gas at high magnetic fields@xcite .    in the context of these unexpected experimental findings ,",
    "the high - field phase diagram of bismuth became subject to a theoretical reinvestigation@xcite .",
    "the landau level spectrum of a fermi liquid is determined by the detailed topology of the fermi surface . in bismuth",
    ", this spectrum becomes complex in the vicinity of the quantum limit for several reasons . to preserve charge neutrality , any modification in density of one type of carriers , caused by emptying a landau level , should be compensated with an equal change in the density of the carriers of the other sign .",

    "moreover , the large spin - orbit coupling leads to an angle - dependent zeeman energy .",
    "for both electrons and hole , the anisotropy of the `` spin mass '' is different from the anisotropy of the cyclotron mass . as early as 1964 , smith et _ al .",
    "_ investigated this feature@xcite .",
    "dirac fermions provide a major motivation to revisit the landau spectrum of bismuth .",
    "it has been known for a long - time that the energy - momentum dispersion of electrons at the l - point is not parabolic and that dirac hamiltonian is appropriate to treat them@xcite .",
    "dirac fermions have been identified as the source of the enhanced diamagnetism in bismuth@xcite , and may generate an unusual weak - field hall conductivity@xcite . during the past decades , several theoretical models of three - dimensional dirac fermions have been proposed and confronted with the experimental data@xcite , but in contrast to the well - established topology of the fermi surface@xcite , the details of the relevant hamiltonian has not been pinned down .    during the last few years , bismuth has attracted attention from other angles of research .",
    "in particular , infrared conductivity measurements have detected a collective electron - plasmon mode ( a  plasmaron\")@xcite and the insulating - like magnetoresistance has been a subject of debate and investigation@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a study of angle - dependent nernst effect in bismuth , which maps the evolution of landau levels of electrons and holes in the whole solid angle up to 12 t. the data are compared to the results of a theoretical calculation based on a model with an extended dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment narrows down the choice of parameters for this model .",
    "two previous reports have mapped the angle - dependent landau spectrum of bismuth in a restricted angular window .",
    "smith and co - workers@xcite used shubnikov- de haas measurements to determine the landau spectrum in ( trigonal , binary ) and ( trigonal , bisectrix ) planes .",
    "this pioneer work established the bulk of electronic properties , but left unsettled the precise magnitude of the hole zeeman energy .",
    "kajimura and co - workers@xcite used giant oscillations of ultrasonic attenuation to obtain a high - resolution map of the landau spectrum near the trigonal axis .",
    "our study , continuing this line of exploration , uses giant quantum oscillations of the nernst coefficient to obtain a high - resolution map in the whole solid angle .",
    "the verification of the non - interacting spectrum in bismuth provides a basis to find an explanation for the additional features ( i.e. nernst peaks@xcite ) which are not expected in this picture .    among the details of the one - particle picture coming out of our investigation ,",
    "let us highlight two .",
    "first , our results definitely settle the uncertainty on the magnitude and anisotropy of the zeeman energy for holes .",
    "second , when the field is along the bisectrix , the spectrum of the three electron pockets is very close to a perfect dirac spectrum where the cyclotron and zeeman energies are indistinguishable . in other words ,",
    "spin and orbital angular momenta are described by a single quantum number . in this configuration , a magnetic field as low as 2.5 t is enough to attain the quantum limit of all electron pockets to put them in their lowest spin - polarized landau sub - level .",
    "in other words , all electron - like carriers become spin polarized , residing in their lowest ( @xmath0 ; where @xmath3 is the total angular momentum ) landau level .",
    "in addition to the case of bulk semi - metallic bismuth , the results reported here may have implications for the analysis of the electronic properties of topological insulators@xcite .",
    "in particular , in the case of bi@xmath4sb@xmath5 alloys@xcite , the electronic spectrum of bulk bismuth and bulk antimony is the starting point to analyze the surface states@xcite of these systems .",
    "the essential properties of electrons at @xmath6 point are the following : ( 1 ) the fermi surface is ellipsoidal and tilted .",
    "( 2 ) the electronic dispersion is non - parabolic . ( 3 ) the landau levels display a slight spin splitting . the first property was already realized at the early stage of investigation@xcite .",
    "the second one , the non - parabolicity of the dispersion , can be naturally obtained on the basis of the @xmath7 perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath7 method was first applied to bismuth by cohen and blount@xcite . soon afterwards",
    ", lax and co - workers used this model to analyze their experimental data@xcite . because of the narrow gap character of @xmath6 point , the number of bands needed is small and a model with coupled two bands gives a very good agreement with experiment . the @xmath7 theory for a two - band model _ without spin _ gives the energy under a magnetic field in the form : @xmath8^{1/2 } ,      $ ] where @xmath9 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath10 is the effective mass along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the third property , the spin splitting@xcite , can be taken into account if we introduce the spins with an effective g - factor ( fig .",
    "[ models ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the energy now becomes @xmath11^{1/2 } , $ ] where @xmath12 is the bohr magneton . in spite of its very simple form , this two - band model , which we will call the smith - baraff - rowell ( sbr ) model , gives a very good account of the experiment , in particular when the magnetic field is oriented close to the trigonal axis@xcite",
    "however , there is a serious intrinsic problem in the sbr model .",
    "when the term @xmath13 is large and negative , the energy becomes imaginary . as a consequence , it is difficult or impossible to use this model when the field is large and oriented far off the trigonal axis .    in the original cohen - blount theory ,",
    "the @xmath7 theory was derived including the spin - orbit coupling ( not fully contained in the sbr model ) , which is extremely large in bismuth ( @xmath14ev@xcite ) .",
    "wolff@xcite found that the cohen - blount theory is essentially identical to the dirac theory in the relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this finding led to the birth of the dirac electron in solids . the two band @xmath7 model with spin - orbit coupling ( dirac model@xcite ) gives the energy@xcite in terms of a quantum number @xmath15 as : @xmath16^{1/2}.      $ ] with this dirac model , the spin - orbit coupling is taken into account and the problem of imaginary energy is removed , so that it can be safely used for all field directions .",
    "on the other hand , in this model , the spin splitting is exactly the same as the landau level splitting , and a double degeneracy occurs for all landau levels except for the lowest landau level @xmath17(fig .",
    "[ models ] ( c ) ) .",
    "this is not in agreement with the experimental observation of spin splitting . to repair this discrepancy and to understand the spin splitting",
    ", baraff extended the dirac model by considering the effect of other bands outside the closely coupled two bands based on the perturbation theory@xcite . as a result",
    ", he showed that it is possible to produce a difference between the orbital level splitting and the spin splitting ( fig .",
    "[ models ] ( d ) ) .",
    "although the baraff s model is complex to use for the interpretation of experimental results , dresselhaus and co - workers@xcite have succeeded to simplify the baraff s model and to obtain theoretical results in good agreement with experiments at least when the magnetic field is oriented along the binary and bisectrix axes . in the simplified model , the energy is given by @xmath18^{1/2 } \\pm g'{\\mu_{\\rm b}}b/2 ,      $ ] where the additional g - factor expresses the effect of outside bands .",
    "with this extended dirac model , all three properties above are taken into account , and no imaginary energy appears in the entire solid angle .",
    "the number of parameters is the same as the sbr model and it is as easy to handle as the sbr model .",
    "consequently , the extended dirac model will be the most appropriate model for the present purpose .",
    "it should be noted here that the energy band model of bismuth has been the subject of an alternative approach , which starts with a simple cubic lattice without spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian for bismuth is then expanded to first order with ( i ) the distortion of the lattice and then with ( ii ) the spin - orbit coupling , and ( iii ) the distance in @xmath19 space from the @xmath6 point .",
    "this approach was first developed by abrikosov and falkovsky@xcite , and established by mcclure@xcite .",
    "one important consequence of this approach is that the dispersion contains in addition to a term linear in @xmath19 term a quadratic term .",
    "this is the so - called non - ellipsoidal non - parabolic dispersion equivalent to the form found by cohen@xcite .",
    "it is also the characteristic of this model that the hamiltonian is directly related to the relative displacements of the atoms , the rhombohedral deformation , and the spin - orbit couplings , so that we can predict the effect of substitution of other elements or the effect of pressure .",
    "the obtained dispersion is similar to the dirac model except for the presence of quadratic ( non - ellipsoidal ) term .",
    "however , there is no compelling evidence to prefer the non - ellipsoidal model over the ellipsoidal model@xcite , in spite of various attempts to use the non - ellipsoidal model for the analysis of experimental data@xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not clearly understood whether this non - ellipsoidal model can reproduce the experimentally resolved spin splitting .",

    "it is easy to distinguish the nernst peaks associated with holes , since there is a single hole pocket and their intensity evolves continuously with rotation . as seen in the figure , the theoretical model gives a very good account of the experimentally - resolved hole peaks in all of the three planes .",
    "when the field rotates in the ( binary , bisectrix ) plane ( fig .",
    "[ binbis ] ) , the hole mass remains constant with no angular dependence ( see table ii ) .",
    "however , as a consequence of a finite angular variation of the fermi energy , which is pulled by the change in the density of electron - like carriers , the hole lines present a small angular modulation . as seen in the figure",
    ", this theoretically expected angular variation is resolved by the experiment .",
    "note also the doubling of the experimentally resolved hole peaks , which is a consequence of a slight misalignment .    as far as the electron lines are concerned , the agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfactory .",
    "note that the three distinct electron pockets become degenerate only when the field is along the trigonal axis .",
    "we found that the angular evolution of those nernst peaks which can be attributed to electrons is in rough agreement with theory .",
    "however , this comparison is complicated by the persistence of additional nernst peaks of unknown origin@xcite , which are hard to distinguish from the electron peaks . in the three figures [ trigbis],[trigbin],[binbis ] , a specific symbol marks those additional peaks .",
    "this symbol is used only when the resolved peak is clearly not one of the expected electron peaks . however , at this stage , in this field range and in particular when the field is almost oriented along the trigonal axis , we can not definitely distinguish between nernst peaks associated with the electron pockets and those which are unexpected . as the field increases and the number of expected electron lines decreases , it becomes more straightforward to clearly distinguish between theoretically expected phase diagram and additional lines resolved by experiment .",
    "this was the case in a recent angle - dependent nernst study extended to high - magnetic fields by our group@xcite .",
    "we have compared different sets of parameters in the model and opted for the set yielding the best agreement with experiment .",
    "these parameters yield an angular dependence for the electron lines , which still differ from the experimental results by a visible margin .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mapzoom ] , which is a zoom on the region in the vicinity of the trigonal axis .",
    "the superposition between the theoretical solid lines and the experimental color map is good but not perfect .",
    "any attempt to repair this imperfection within the model used here led to a departure from the quite satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment on the subject of the angular variation of the hole lines .",
    "the imperfect agreement between theory and experiment regarding the electron lines may point to some deeper physics associated with electron interaction .",
    "a recent theory@xcite suggests that coulomb interaction in presence of strong mass anisotropy can lead to an inequality in the occupation of the three equivalent electron valleys .",
    "here , the relative agreement between theory and experiment puts an upper limit on any hypothetical inequality in the occupancy of the three equivalent electron valleys .",
    "given the impressive agreement between theory and experiment in the case of holes , however , the relative disagreement in case of electrons ( in particular for an arbitrarily - oriented magnetic field ) may be speculatively attributed to a mild `` spontaneous valley polarization '' .",
    "a particularly important issue is the zeeman splitting of the holes .",
    "when the field is along the trigonal axis , at low enough temperature , hole peaks are twin peaks , save for the one at the highest field at 9 t. this is a consequence of zeeman splitting .",
    "the absence of splitting for the 9 t peak associated with the @xmath117 landau level can be naturally understood if one assumes that the landau indexes of the two adjacent peaks differ by two . in other words ,",
    "the zeeman energy creates a quasi - degeneracy between the @xmath118 and @xmath119 landau levels , when the field is parallel to the trigonal axis . on the other hand ,",
    "when the field is perpendicular to the trigonal axis , the zeeman energy is vanishingly small .",
    "these features have been known since smith and co - workers@xcite . from the position of the zeeman - split peaks in the b @xmath111 trigonal configuration",
    ", they concluded that @xmath120 is either 2.16 or 1.84 .",
    "indeed , the hole spectrum for b//trigonal does not allow to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "the zeeman energy can be slightly larger or slightly lower than twice the cyclotron energy according to the way one indexes the twin peaks .",
    "previous studies , focused on the spectrum in the vicinity of the trigonal axis , used either the former value @xcite or the latter@xcite . on the other hand , there is no ambiguity in indexing the landau levels in the b @xmath121 trigonal configuration and , thus , the angular map allows to definitely settle this issue .",
    "the model used here assumes that @xmath122 and , as seen in fig .",
    "[ trigbis ] and fig .",
    "[ trigbin ] , successfully reproduces the complex experimentally - resolved angular dependence of the hole lines and in particular the angle at which they cross each other .",
    "when the field becomes perpendicular to the trigonal axis the splitting is below the threshold of experimental resolution even in the subkelvin temperature range and in a field of 9 t. this can be seen in fig.[holegfactor ] , which tracks the evolution of the hole zeeman splitting in the vicinity of @xmath123 .",
    "in other words , @xmath120 is lower than the experimental resolution in agreement with theory ( see table ii ) .",
    "our angle - dependent nernst measurements map the landau spectrum of bismuth up to 12 t. the experimental results are confronted with a theoretical model treating holes as quasi - particles with a parabolic dispersion and electrons as dirac fermions . within this model , we found a set of parameters , which produce theoretical results in good agreement with the experimentally resolved spectrum in the whole solid angle . the model :    1 .",
    "fits almost the entire hole spectrum very well .",
    "2 .   finds @xmath124 for holes when the field is along the trigonal axis in agreement with the experimental value @xcite .",
    "3 .   yields a satisfactory description of the level cross between @xmath62 and @xmath63 when the field rotates in the ( binary , bisectrix ) . plane .",
    "4 .   assumes a tilt angle for the electron pockets , @xmath22 , which is in agreement with previous low - field studies@xcite .",
    "5 .   concludes that @xmath125 and @xmath63 meet at @xmath126 t when the field is oriented along the trigonal axis in agreement with experiment .    on the other hand , the model is not entirely successful . in particular , the fine structure near the trigonal axis according to theory and experiment are somewhat different .",
    "an important conclusion of this analysis is that when a field exceeding 2.5 t is applied along the bisectrix axis , all electrons reside in their lowest ( @xmath0 ) spin - polarized landau level .",
    "finally , let us add that additional nernst peaks , unexpected in the non - interacting picture , were resolved on top of this complex spectrum .",
    "the explanation of their origin is a subject of ongoing research .",
