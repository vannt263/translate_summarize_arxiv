    "1999c ) , and has since remained in an active state , during which numerous bursts have been recorded with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory_. due to earth occultation of the source for batse , the most notable event from this source , emitted on 27 august 1998 , went undetected .",
    "this exceptional flare ( hurley et al .",
    "1999d ) was much more energetic ( factor of @xmath1 500 ) than the brightest burst emissions detected from this sgr before or since , and rivals in intensity the brightest sgr outburst ever recorded , the famous 5 march 1979 event from sgr  @xmath16 ( mazets et al . 1979 ) .",
    "we observed sgr  @xmath0 with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) proportional counter array ( pca ) at the beginning of its active period during late may and early june 1998 , as well as directly following the 27 august 1998 flare .",

    "this rate differs significantly from the values measured during the burst active period , confirming that long - term variations in the spin - down rate , possibly related to burst activity , occur .",
    "an archival rxte observation from september 1996 extended the baseline of the quiescent spin - down , and agrees to first order with the slower spin - down observed during quiescence ( marsden , rothschild & lingenfelter 1999 ) .",
    "to further investigate the period history during the burst active period , we have observed sgr  @xmath0 with the rxte pca periodically between 3 january 1999 and 25 may 1999 .",
    "we combine a subset of these data with previously reported results , in addition to a separate analysis of all rxte observations from september 1996 through october 1998 and construct a period history for sgr  @xmath0 over 2.5 years .",
    "we also report on the burst rate history of sgr  @xmath0 as seen with batse and discuss possible correlations between the burst activity and the changes observed in the spin - down .",
    "sgr  @xmath0 was observed with the rxte pca in september 1996 for 100 ksec over 16 days .",

    ". these phases could not be well fit with a linear phase model , so we included a second order term ( i.e. frequency derivative ) .",
    "this fit yielded a good reduced @xmath19 of 0.8 for 5 degrees of freedom ( see table 1 ) . the phase - folded profile ( 2  10 kev ) for this ephemeris",
    "is given in figure 1a .",
    "the period and period derivative derived from this fit ( see table 1 ) are similar to , but not within the errors reported by marsden et al .",
    "we estimate the average spin - down rate between september 1996 and april 1998 ( quiescence ) by performing a least squares fit to all period measurements during this time interval and find a value 6.13(2 ) @xmath15 10@xmath5 s s@xmath7 .",
    "the statistical error here has been inflated by the square root of the reduced @xmath19 ( 168 ) of the linear fit .",
    "the period derivative measurement for september 1996 has been extrapolated for 250 days in figure 2 ( dotted lines represent @xmath20 ) to clearly indicate the discrepancy between the local slope and the long - term trend .",
    "the improved precision of the period derivative measurement within this observation and the inclusion of the bepposax period measured from may 1997 allows us to conclude that there are significant deviations from a constant spin - down rate during quiescence .",
    "we have also re - analyzed rxte pca observations of sgr  @xmath0 during may / june 1998 and august - october 1998 .",
    "for the first sequence of observations from 31 may through 9 june 1998 , we processed the data as before and find a second order phase model represents the data well with a reduced @xmath19 of 1.3 for 13 dof ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the phase folded profile ( figure 1b ) is consistent with the lightcurve found in september 1996 , which shows the profile did not change over a long time period ( 1.7 years ) , as well as after significant burst activity .",
    "we have extended the baseline of the second sequence of observations from 6 days ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999b ) to 42 days .",
    "due to the large number of bursts detected during these observations ( more than 1000 ) , we have binned the data with finer time resolution ( 0.05 sec ) to better filter out these bursts . over this",
    "much longer baseline , a simple second - order phase model fits the data reasonably well , but not completely ( @xmath19 = 2.4 for 25 dof ) .",
    "the phase folded profile ( figure 1c ) is significantly different during these observations as pointed out by kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1999b ) and shows the pulse shape changes observed during the tail of the august 27@xmath21 flare ( mazets et al .",
    "1999 ) persist for months",
    ". combination of these observations with a more recent rxte observation campaign will allow us to better investigate these low phase amplitude deviations .",
    "a new series of rxte pca observations of sgr  @xmath0 began on 3 january 1999 and are currently on - going through 25 may 1999 .",
    "we have selected a subset of three observations sufficiently long to obtain an accurate measurement of the pulsar period .",
    "for each of these observations , we have used standard 1 data ( 2  60 kev ) binned at 0.125 s time resolution with barycenter corrected time bins . using a phase folding technique , we have calculated the period for each observation .",
    "the results of these measurements are summarized in table 1 .",
    "although summed over a different energy range , the phase folded profile is the same as found during the fall of 1998 .",
    "the x - ray periods measured during 1999 lie slightly above the extrapolation of the period derivative found during the fall of 1998 .",
    "we find a linear least squares fit to the period measurements after 27 august 1998 yields an average period derivative 6.07(15 ) @xmath15 10@xmath5 s s@xmath7 ; again , the statistical error is inflated by the square root of the reduced @xmath19 ( 56 ) .",
    "we note that the reported radio period measurement during december 1998 and january 1999 is highly discrepant ( the reported period is more than 5000@xmath22 away from the linear fit , and the period derivative is double what is found in x - rays over the same time interval ; see figure 2 ) .",

    "between may 1998 and january 1999 , batse triggered on 63 bursts from sgr  @xmath0 .",
    "the on - board batse trigger criteria were set at low - energy trigger ( channels 1 + 2 ; 25  100 kev ) , nominal trigger ( channels 2 + 3 ; 50  300 kev ) and high - energy trigger ( channels 3 + 4 ; 100  2000 kev ) , each for significant time intervals during the burst active period . due to the relatively soft nature of the typical burst emission from sgrs , batse s sensitivity to sgr events changed according to",
    "which trigger criterion was in use .",
    "other factors , such as inability to read out on - board memory before the next event , resulted in untriggered events as well . in order to obtain a more complete database",
    ", we performed an off - line search for untriggered events from sgr  @xmath0 .",
    "batse consists of eight nai detectors which form a regular octahedron and are sensitive to photons with energies 25 kev  2 mev ( fishman et al .",
    "1989 ) . using cgro spacecraft pointing information , we calculated the zenith angles for each detector and determined the two detectors with the lowest zenith angles for each spacecraft orientation .",
    "for all days during each orientation , we searched the discla data ( 1.024 s time resolution ) for simultaneous fluctuations in these detectors for energy channel 1 ( 25  50 kev ) .",
    "the background was estimated by fitting a first - order polynomial to 10 seconds of data before and after each bin with a 3 second gap between the background interval and the bin searched .",
    "an off - line trigger was defined as a fluctuation greater than 4.5 @xmath22 and 3.0 @xmath22 in the two brightest detectors , respectively , an excess of counts below 50 kev , relative to the counts between 50 and 300 kev for the brightest detector and a duration less than 7 seconds .",
    "each trigger was visually inspected and coarsely located based upon the relative rates in the batse modules . between 24 may 1998 and 3 february 1999 , we detected most of the sgr  @xmath0 events which triggered batse in addition to 137 untriggered events .",
    "some triggered events were not detected off - line because the discla data has coarser time resolution than the time scale on which most sgr events trigger ( 64 msec ) or the trigger occurred during a telemetry data gap .",
    "the large number of untriggered events relative to triggered bursts is due to extended periods ( more than 4 months ) when the batse trigger was in ` high - energy mode . '",
    "based upon our experience with classifying batse triggers , we expect the number of false triggers within our sample to be less than 5% .",
    "figure 2 displays the burst rate ( per 3 day interval ) over the time period searched .",
    "no emission from sgr  @xmath0 triggered the batse instrument between august 1992 ( kouveliotou et al . 1993 ) and 25 may 1998 .",
    "we note that the burst activity is currently low , but has not ceased as of the writing of this manuscript .",
    "we have shown that during quiescence , the spin - down rate of sgr  @xmath0 is not constant .",
    "the deviations observed may be caused by processes such as : orbital doppler shifts ; persistent but variable emission of alfvn waves and/or particles from magnetars ( thompson & blaes 1998 ) ; radiative precession in such an object ( melatos 1999 ) ; or discontinuous spin - up events ( glitches ) as seen in radio pulsars ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; heyl & hernquist 1998 ) . due to the sparsely sampled data for this source , we can not exclude any of these models currently .",
    "more frequent measurements are required before anything definitive can be said about modeling these deviations .",
    "the period history of sgr  @xmath0 appears to be divided into two sections during which the spin - down rate is nearly , but not exactly , constant .",
    "the pulse period and period derivative reported by shitov ( 1999 ) for a radio pulsar connected with sgr  @xmath0 appears incompatible with the x - ray spin history presented here . before 9 june 1998 and after 27 august 1998 ,",
    "the average rate is 6.1 @xmath15 10@xmath5 s s@xmath7 .",
    "these two sections are separated by 80 days during which the period increased by 1 ms , which implies an average rate of 14.0 @xmath15 10@xmath5 s s@xmath7 .",
    "it appears that the period history during this interval allows for two obvious descriptions : ( i ) a gradual increase of the nominal spin - down rate and ( ii ) a discontinuous spin - down event associated with the 27 august 1998 flare .",
    "according to the first picture , following the initial flurry of burst activity in late may 1998 , the spin - down rate increased by a factor @xmath1 2.3 .",
    "this rate persisted for @xmath1 80 days , then decreased to near its original value after 27 august 1998 .",
    "if this were the correct description , then we can not attribute the enhanced spin - down directly to the magnitude of the burst activity .",
    "the number of bursts recorded with batse between the onset of activity in may and 26 august 1998 was 40 ( the extraordinary , multi - episodic burst of 30 may 1998 , hurley et al .",
    "1999c , is counted here as a single event ) . following the 27 august 1998 flare ,",
    "123 bursts were recorded up to 3 february 1999 , including a multi - episodic event on 1 september 1998 similar to , although less intense than the 30 may 1998 event .",
    "the total burst energy recorded in the events following the 27 august flare is more than double the energy released through burst emission prior to the flare .",
    "if one assumes that the burst rate or the burst energy released is correlated with the increase in spin - down , then one would expect to see an even steeper spin - down rate between 28 aug 1998 and 3 january 1999 , which is not the case .",
    "the increased breaking torque on the star must then be attributed to something other than the burst activity as measured by the burst rate or the burst energy of the smaller , more common bursts .    an alternative scenario to account for the rapid spin - down during the period june ",
    "september 1998 is that the star underwent a more or less steady spin - down at a long - term average rate of @xmath1 6 @xmath15 10@xmath5 s s@xmath7 from june through most of august .",
    "the star then suffered a discontinuous upward jump in period or a `` braking glitch '' , which is attractive to link with the occurrence of the very energetic flare of 27 august 1998 . extrapolating the long - term trends found before and after 27 august",
    ", we find that this braking glitch would have a magnitude @xmath24p = 5.72(14 ) @xmath15 10@xmath25 s. this corresponds to a rotational energy loss for the star @xmath24e@xmath26 ergs if the whole star participates , or 0.5% of the energy released in high - energy photons during the 27 august flare .",
