    "further convergence properties of the uict measure are proven , in particular , using the relation to a size - biased critical galton - watson process , the convergence of the joint boundary length - area process to a diffusion process is shown from which one can extract the quantum hamiltonian through the standard feynman - kac procedure . in a different work @xcite , the existence of a phase transition of the quenched ising model coupled to uict is shown . all the above mentioned articles",

    "the proof follows immediately from the previous proposition [ theo : nt ] .",
    "this theorem is analogous to a result by durhuus , jonsson and wheater ( theorem 3 in @xcite ) which is derived for uict using the bijection to critical galton - watson processes conditioned to never die out . in this construction ,",
    "subsequent generations in the branching process correspond to vertices of subsequent slices of fixed minimal graph distance , i.e.  geodesic distance , from the initial boundary .",
    "this is in contrast to the construction through the growth process where the triangulation is grown triangle by triangle .",
    "one can think of both constructions as being dual to each other in the sense that in the branching process picture geodesic distance is fixed and area growth is estimated while in the growth process area is fixed and geodesic distance is estimated .",
    "we will comment further on this duality in section [ conclusion ] .    to prove proposition  [ theo : nt ] we need three lemmas of which the first two",
    "are proven in appendix [ appa1 ] .",

    "first let us prove the rhs of ( [ in1 ] ) .",
    "from lemma  [ lm : sn21 ] it follows that for almost every trajectory @xmath227 of the growth process there exists a constant @xmath245 ( in the following we will omit @xmath227 from our notations ) such that , for any @xmath10 , @xmath246 using and , we get @xmath247 from this and using the inequality @xmath248 we also have @xmath249 and thus , @xmath250 from and it follows that there exists a constant @xmath251 such that @xmath252 where we use for the first inequality and for the second one .",
    "note also that the constant @xmath253 depends on the whole trajectory of the process , but does not depend on @xmath12 .",

    "we have @xmath300 possible trajectories of the growth process .",
    "the last observation is that any such trajectory , starting at the point @xmath42 and finishing at @xmath205 has the same probability @xmath301 ( including the trajectories with reflection ) .",
    "this completes the proof .    using lemma [ lm : probstrip ] the transition probability from @xmath237 to @xmath238 is exactly equal the corresponding expression for the uict , i.e.   .",
    "the proof then follows directly from theorem 4.1 of @xcite .",

    "in this article we present a growth process which samples sections of uniform infinite causal triangulations ( uict ) . in particular ,",
    "a triangulation is grown by adding a single triangle according to two different moves , denoted  @xmath62 \" and  @xmath66 \" , with probability @xmath308 where @xmath76 denotes the length of the boundary of the triangulation at step @xmath10 of the growth process .",
    "the @xmath87-moves are illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , the @xmath62-move increases the boundary length by one while the @xmath66-move decreases it by one .",
    "this growth process can equivalently be described by a recurrent markov chain @xmath7 for the boundary length of the triangulation @xmath82 as noted in remark [ yamb - th1 ] .",
    "it is shown in theorem [ yamb - th2 ] that the growth process constructs so - called almost causal triangulations which are causal triangulations with certain defects as shown in figure [ f3 ] . defining the stoping times @xmath11 when the growth process completes the strip @xmath309 $ ] at `` height '' @xmath12 , it is shown in theorem [ thmbijuict ] that there is a bijection between the almost causal triangulations created by the growth process and ( regular ) causal triangulations which furthermore preserves the probability of the corresponding triangulation .",
    "hence , the growth process @xmath7 with @xmath200 when stopped at @xmath11 indeed samples sections of uict of height @xmath12 with initial boundary equal to @xmath41 and final boundary arbitrary",
    ".    using the growth process , as described above , we show in proposition [ theo : nt ] that for almost every trajectory of the growth process one can find two constants @xmath310 such that @xmath311 .",
    "this implies that the fractal dimension is given by @xmath233 almost surely as stated in theorem [ theo : fractal ] .",
    "this derivation is dual to previous results in @xcite which employs the relation to branching processes : in the branching process geodesic distance is fixed while area growth is estimated , whereas in the growth process area ( which is equal to growth time ) is fixed and geodesic distance is estimated .",

    "this duality relation also clarifies the so - called peeling procedure as introduced by watabiki @xcite in the context of euclidean quantum gravity and derived in @xcite for cdt .    as a continuation of the presented work it would be interesting to extend the work of angel @xcite and investigate the convergence of the boundary length process coming from the growth process of dt to a lvy process .",
    "furthermore , one could extend the here developed techniques to multi - critical dt @xcite as well as to a recently introduced model of multi - critical cdt @xcite .",
