    "in optical pumping , absorption of the near - resonance circularly polarized light could lead to large population imbalances in atomic ground states and induce the polarization of the atoms@xcite .",
    "a variety of applications , from traditional studies on nuclear resonance gyroscope@xcite , atomic clock , optical pumped magnetometer to the recently developed experiments in atomic spin gyroscope , have use the electron - spin polarization for precise measurements . among them",
    ", the recently developed serf magnetometer features a higher sensitivity and a much more portable package , compared to the superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) , thus provides a better way to measure magnetocardiography ( mcg ) and magnetoencephalography ( meg ) signals . with a sufficient high cell temperature and weakly shielded environment , such that @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the time between spin - exchange collisions and @xmath2 is the spin precession rate ) , the spin - exchange collisions would not broaden the magnetic resonance linewidth and it indicates the realization of the serf regime@xcite . as the operation principle of the sensors mentioned above relies on the spin polarization , the value of the polarization would affect the performance of these sensors .",
    "thus , it is necessary to monitor the polarization of the alkali - metal atoms . a general experimental technique by turning the pump laser beam on and off has been used to calculate the spin polarization@xcite . by applying an oscillating magnetic field ,",
    "the transverse electronic paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy is another efficient method to obtain the population status .",
    "however , both of these processes would introduce an extra perturbation into the sensor proper and affect its normal operation .",
    "the motivation of this article is to develop a non - perturbative scheme to acquire the polarization of the electron - spin while minimizing the introduction of perturbation to the system . by investigating the relationship between the electron - spin polarization and the transmission of the circularly polarized pump laser beam ,",
    "here we propose a new scheme , which only relies on the pump laser intensity , to extract the electron - spin polarization .",
    "compared to the previous methods , this technique has the advantage that no extra disturbance is introduced into the sensor . besides , this scheme could achieve a real - time observation and requires less components .",
    "we experimentally validate the method in a serf magnetometer and the results are in excellent agrement with the theory .",
    "the model could deep our understanding of the absorption process of the pump laser and facilitate the optimization of the polarization in the atomic sensors .",
    "the electron - spin polarization of the alkali - metal atoms along the @xmath3 direction ( pumping axis ) @xmath4 is defined by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the optical pumping rate due to the circularly polarized pump laser , @xmath7 is the spin - destruction rate due to collisions with other alkali atoms , buffer gas atoms and quenching gas molecules@xcite .",
    "while the atoms illuminated by the pump laser are polarized , those atoms outside the illumination region still could be polarized by the diffusion effects .",
    "and the diffusion length in one relaxation time is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient@xcite . under typical experimental condition of the cs magnetometer , where @xmath10 1@xmath11s and @xmath12 mm@xmath13s , the corresponding diffusion length is about 0.36 mm @xcite . for a monochromatic laser",

    "if the value of @xmath18 is known , then eq.([eq : electronpolrizationreplace ] ) provides a useful method to measure the atomic spin polarization .    as the pump beam with circular polarization propagates through the vapor cell , the the populations of the atoms are redistributed and the reduction in the laser intensity @xmath16",

    ", we would obtain the corresponding electron - spin polarization in real time .",
    "note that eqs.([eq : electronpolrizationreplace ] ) and ( [ eq : transmittedintensitysimple ] ) only rely on the intensity of the pump laser , which is the essential part of the devices mentioned above , thus this scheme could be conducted without adding any additional component . meanwhile ,",

    "a step in the @xmath34 field with an amplitude of 0.05 nt has been applied at each pump laser intensity and the response should be maximized when the spin polarization is equal to 50@xmath55 according to eq.([eq : magsignal ] ) .",
    "the configuration of the experimental setup used is depicted in fig.[fig : experimentalsetup ] , and is centered around a spherical vapor cell with a diameter of 12 mm .",
    "the vapor cell contains a droplet of cs metal , 50 torr of n@xmath56 gas and 500 torr of @xmath57he gas .",
    "the n@xmath56 prevents radiation trapping , while @xmath57he was included to reduce the diffusion effect to the cell walls .",

    "a set of four cylindrical layers of @xmath59-metal magnetic shield enclosed the cell and provides a shielding factor of @xmath60 to quasi - static magnetic fields .",
    "the vapor cell was optically pumped by a circularly polarized pump beam originating from a distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser .",
    "the pump laser , with a spectral width of about 2 mhz , was tuned to the cs @xmath61 resonance line and directed along the @xmath3 axis . according to eq.([eq : transmittedintensity ] ) , the transmitted laser intensity @xmath16 would vary with the different incident laser intensity . the incident and the transmitted laser intensities",
    "were recorded by two photodiodes ( pd1 and pd2 ) , simultaneously .",
    "the probe laser beam , formed by another dfb system , is detuned by about 0.3 nm to the red side of the @xmath62 resonance line and propagates in the @xmath35 axis .",
    "the first calcite polarizer ( lp2 ) determines the initial linear polarization axis at 0@xmath58 .",
    "faraday rotation from the atoms rotates the polarization plane of the probe beam by an angle @xmath63 according to eq.([eq : rotationangle ] ) .",
    "then , a quarter waveplate ( qw2 ) with one of its axes nominally aligned with the calcite polarizer contributes a circular component proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "a final calcite polarizer ( lp3 ) , which acts as an analyzer and is crossed with the original polarizer , selects the time varying intensity of the transmitted light .",
    "a photo - elastic modulator ( pem ) following the quarter waveplate is used to modulate the polarization of probe laser in order to improve the s / n ( the ratio of signal to noise ) . and the modulation axis of the pem is oriented at 45@xmath58 with respect to the transmission axis of the polarizer .",
    "finally , the probe beam transmitted through the cell is detected by a photodiode ( pd3 ) and the time - varying intensity on pd3 is given by@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the incident intensity of the probe beam , @xmath66 rad and @xmath67hz are the depth and the frequency of the pem modulation .",
    "note that the time - varying intensity of the probe beam @xmath68 is definitely different from the distance - dependent intensity of the pump beam @xmath16 .",
    "the photocurrent is amplified by a low - noise transimpedance amplifier and demodulated by a commercial computer - controlled digital lock - in amplifier ( zurich instruments , model hf2li ) referenced to the pem . via detecting the optical rotation of the polarization plane",
    ", the residual magnetic fields could be further canceled actively by three orthogonal coils inside the shields in order to realize the serf regime@xcite . under the serf regime , the spin relaxation arising from the spin - exchange collisions is completely eliminated and the spin - destruction collisions dominate the absorption of the pump laser .",
    "c and the red line overlapping the data points is the fitting curve according to eq.([eq : transmittedintensitysimple ] ) , from which the value of @xmath18 is deduced .",
    "the inset shows magnification of the transmission curves .",
    "note that the linearly polarized components of the pump laser beam would be completely absorbed by the hot atoms and thus contribute to the further reduction of the pump laser intensity . in our experiment , the degree of the pump beam polarization is approximately 0.9 and this factor should be included in the curve fitting process based on eq .",

    "the blue line shows the unmodified model based on eq.([eq : rotationangle ] ) while the red dashed line is the fitting curve according to the modified version of eq.([eq : rotationangle ] ) , where the diffusion term described by eq.([eq : diffusionsig ] ) should be included . ]    in fig.[fig : incidenttransmittedintensity ] , we plot the transmitted laser intensity as a function of the incident laser intensity at room temperature and 100 @xmath58c .",
    "the density of the vapor cell at room temperature ( @xmath70 ) is more than two orders less than that at 100 @xmath58c ( @xmath71 ) , and the absorption due to the atoms at room temperature is ignorable .",
    "as the blue triangles shown in fig.[fig : incidenttransmittedintensity ] , the transmitted laser intensity is proportional to the incident laser intensity and the reduction of the laser intensity reflects the transmission of the system components , including the uncoated optical glass windows , focus lenses as well as the vapor cell made from aluminosilicate glass . compared to the results obtained at room temperature , the data points at 100 @xmath58c show nonlinear absorption when the incident intensity is less than about 1 mw ( see inset in fig.[fig : incidenttransmittedintensity ] ) , in which the value of @xmath18 could be extracted form the fitting according to eq.([eq : transmittedintensitysimple ] ) . however , at high laser intensity the transmitted laser intensity @xmath16 scales linearly with @xmath28 , which implies that the atoms are almost fully polarized .    utilizing the coefficient @xmath18 obtained above and the incident laser intensity",
    ", we could achieve the polarization measurements of the electron - spin using eq.([eq : electronpolrizationreplace ] ) .",
    "the electron - spin polarization of cs atoms as a function of the incident laser intensity is shown in fig.[fig : polarizationsignal ] .",
    "the measured values based on eq.([eq : electronpolrizationreplace ] ) agree very well with the prediction described by eq.([eq : electronpolrization ] ) .    the dependence of the magnetic response on the electron polarization has also been studied .",
    "the magnetometer responses contained in eq.([eq : rotationmeasure ] ) are extracted by the lock - in amplifier and are shown in fig.[fig : magneticresponsesignal ] .",
    "the magnetometer signal increase with the incident laser intensity in the weak intensity range of @xmath72 mw and the system achieves the maximum value when the polarization is nearly @xmath73 , shown in fig.[fig : magneticresponsesignal ] .",
    "however , the values at hight intensity deviate from the theory , which we suspect it is the result of the diffusion effects and the model described by eq.([eq : magsignal ] ) need to be modified .",
    "the polarization of the atoms outside the illumination region degrades as the distance @xmath35 from the illumination region increases , @xmath74 where the initial polarization @xmath75 .",
    "the polarization of the atoms outside the illumination region also contributes to the final response of the magnetic field . to get the corresponding contribution from @xmath76 to the rotation signal similar to eq.([eq : magsignal ] ) , we need to know the @xmath35 projection arising from the polarized atoms in the diffusion region .",
    "it could be obtained by integrating @xmath76 over the diffusion length , given by @xmath77 where the term associated with the optical pumping rate has been dropped out compared to eq.([eq : magsignal ] ) .",
    "the rotation angle arising from eq.([eq : diffusionsig ] ) should be accounted for and added to eq.([eq : rotationangle ] ) .",
    "as the red dashed line shown in fig.[fig : magneticresponsesignal ] , the fitting curve based on the modified model fit the data better . as the contribution from eq.([eq : diffusionsig ] ) depends on the species of the alkali - metal atoms and the noble gases as well as the cell pressure , thus the total optimal polarization would deviate from 50@xmath55 and tends to become greater .",
    "note that the specific optimal value would not be a constant and changes with the cell parameters of the system .",
    "in summary , we have studied the relationship between the electron - spin polarization and the intensity of the circularly polarized pump laser , based on which a scheme has been proposed to extract the electron - spin polarization . compared to the traditional methods to obtain the polarization , this technique only relying on the transmitted pump laser intensity operates in a non - perturbative mode and has the advantage that no extra disturbance is introduced into the sensor .",
    "we therefore anticipate that the scheme described here could detect real - time polarization without disturbing the normal operation of the sensor .",
    "a comparison of the experimental results with theoretical calculations is also presented .",
    "the experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction and verify the validity of the scheme proposed here .",
    "we also investigated the corresponding magnetic field response of the serf magnetometer as a function of the electron - spin polarization . and",
    "a modified model , where we has added the diffusion term to the original model , has been reported to explain the discrepancy of the response between the experimental data and the theory .    as the atomic spin polarization can be derived from the intensity of transmitted pump laser beam",
    ", the transmitted intensity could be used to maintain the stability of the pump beam intensity and thus keep the electron spin polarization stable .",
    "this strategy allows to reduce the number of components in the pumping systems and results in a simplification of the system structure . from our perspective ,",
    "our results give new insight into the laser absorption progress for many optical pumping systems , and especially useful for the magnetometer or comagnetometer operated in the serf regime .",
