    "complex networks have become a key approach to understanding many social , biological , chemical , physical and information systems , where nodes represent individuals and links denote the relations or interactions between nodes . in this sense , to study the dynamics of such systems is actually to investigate the dynamical behaviors on the networks . in particular , the network synchronization as an important emerging phenomenon of a population of dynamically interacting units in various fields of science",
    "has attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "most works focused on studying the relation between network topology and the synchronization  @xcite , enhancing the synchronizability by designing the weighting strategies  @xcite .",
    "moveover , some efforts have been made to study the synchronization in directed networks  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the optimal structure for synchronizability is a directed tree  @xcite and the convergence time is strongly related to the depth of the tree  @xcite .",
    "most of the experiments on investigating the dynamic behaviors are implemented on small - size networks . however ,",
    "when the networks contains very large number of nodes , it becomes sometimes impossible to model the dynamic process .",
    "for example , to investigate the synchronization , extrapolating the coupled differential equations model of a single node to this large system is too complicated to be carried out .    a promising way to address",
    "this problem is to coarse grain the network , namely to reduce the network complexity by means of mapping the large network into a smaller one .",
    "the coarse graining techniques have been successfully applied to model large genetic networks  @xcite and extract the slowest motions in protein networks  @xcite .",
    "essentially , the coarse graining process is very similar to the problem of cluster finding or community detection in networks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some popular methods ) .",
    "the coarse - grained network is obtained by merging the nodes in the same cluster or community .",
    "however , the coarse graining model is far beyond the clustering techniques , since it requires the coarse - grained networks keep the same topological properties or dynamic behaviors as the initial networks , such as preserving the degree distribution , cluster coefficient , assortativity correlation  @xcite , the properties of random walk on the network  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite and critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "most of the former works on coarse graining consider undirected networks .",
    "however , in many real systems , the interactions between individuals are not reciprocal .",
    "for example , the food web , gene regulation system , metabolic system and neural system are usually represented by directed networks where the nodes are affected by their upstream nodes . in directed networks , of course we can ignore link directions and apply methods developed for undirected networks , but this approach discarding potentially useful information contained in the link directions may lead to dramatically change of the key organizational features when coarse graining the networks  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some prominent methods may confront problems when applied to directed networks . among all these existing coarse graining methods for undirected networks , the spectral coarse graining ( scg )",
    "method is a very general method which can be applied in many dynamic processes such as synchronization , random walk and epidemic spread  @xcite . in order to preserve a typical eigenvalue , the scg method coarse grains the nodes with similar elements in the corresponding eigenvectors . for different dynamic processes ,",
    "different eigenvalues should be considered .",
    "therefore the choice of the eigenvectors is indeed problem dependent . as the synchronizability",
    "is mainly related to the largest and smallest nonzero eigenvalue , the scg method for synchronization takes the @xmath0 and @xmath1 into consideration ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 are respectively the eigenvectors for the smallest nonzero and the largest eigenvalue ) .",
    "however , this method may not provide good performance in directed networks since the eigenvector elements can not successfully characterize the nodes dynamic role .",
    "for instance , the nodes in different layers may have exactly the same eigenvector elements in directed acyclic networks while the nodes with exactly the same topology may have totally different eigenvector elements in directed networks with cycles .",
    "in a word , to design an effective coarse graining method for directed networks is still challenging .    in this paper , we propose a path - based coarse graining ( pcg ) method to coarse grain directed networks for synchronization .",
    "the basic idea is that the nodes who obtain the same impacts from other nodes are similar to each other , and thus can be merged .",
    "the impacts that one node receives from other nodes are calculated via tracing the origin of the source in the directed networks ( i.e. , along the opposite direction of links ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that the dynamical correlation can be predicted from such topological similarity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , coarse graining in this way will most naturally merge the nodes according to their functional performance and likely preserve the dynamical properties .",
    "the linear stability analysis of synchronization and numerical simulation of the kuramoto model on four kinds of directed networks , including tree networks and variants of barabsi - albert networks , watts - strogatz networks and erds - rnyi networks , show that our method can effectively preserve the synchronizability of the initial directed networks .",
    "additionally , we find the far sources play more important roles when identifying the nodes roles in directed networks with obvious hierarchy structure , while the near sources are more important in the directed networks with many loops .",
    "many structural - based similarity indices have been proposed to quantify the nodes similarity  @xcite , most of which only work for undirected networks . how to define the nodes similarity in directed networks is still a challenge . here",
    "we propose a method via tracing the origin of impacts in directed network .",
    "the basic assumption is that two nodes are structural - similar if they obtain the same impacts from other nodes , and thus they are more likely to be merged during the coarse graining process . given a directed network @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the set of nodes and directed links respectively .",
    "multiple links and self - connections are not allowed .",
    "the impact of node @xmath5 on node @xmath6 is defined by summing over the collection of directed paths from @xmath5 to @xmath6 with exponential weights by length .",
    "the mathematical expression reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the set of all directed paths with length @xmath9 starting from node @xmath5 to node @xmath6 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the adjacency matrix : if @xmath5 points to @xmath6 @xmath12 , otherwise @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a free parameter that controls the weights of the paths .",
    "smaller @xmath14 indicates assigning more weights on the short paths , and vice versa . here the paths whose lengths are not larger than @xmath15 are considered . if @xmath16 , namely considering all directed paths from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , eq .  [ tracing ] is similar to the _ katz _",
    "index  @xcite .",
    "however , the significant difference is twofold : on one hand , the adjacency matrix in katz index is symmetrical while asymmetrical in eq .",
    "[ tracing ] ; on the other hand , the parameter @xmath14 is usually smaller than unit in katz index , namely assigning more weights to the short paths , while in eq .",
    "[ tracing ] @xmath14 has no limitation .",
    "since counting all paths between every pair of nodes is very time - consuming especially in large networks , we here set @xmath15 equal to the length of the longest path among all the shortest paths between two nodes .",
    "note that when @xmath16 and @xmath14 is smaller than the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath11 ( i.e. , ensure the convergence ) , the impact matrix @xmath17 with element @xmath18 defined in eq .",
    "[ tracing ] can be directly calculated by @xmath19 .",
    "we assign each node @xmath5 a @xmath20 dimensional impact - vector which is equal to the @xmath5th column of matrix @xmath17 , namely @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of nodes .",
    "clearly , if two nodes receive the same impacts from their ancestors ( i.e. , upstream nodes ) , they tend to have the same phase in synchronization , and thus are more likely to be merged during coarse graining .",
    "suppose we are going to coarse grain a network containing @xmath20 nodes to a smaller one with @xmath23 nodes .",
    "we adopt the k - means clustering method  @xcite to partition the @xmath20 nodes into @xmath23 groups .",
    "the nodes in the same group will be merged .",
    "the k - means clustering technique aims at minimizing the within - cluster sum of squares : @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 is the centroid of cluster @xmath27 which is equal to the mean of points in cluster @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 the detailed steps of k - means clustering are shown as follows : ( i ) choose @xmath23 vectors as the initial centroid of each cluster .",
    "( ii ) randomly choose a node @xmath5 from the set @xmath3 .",
    "this node will belong to the cluster @xmath27 if the distance between its vector @xmath29 and the centroid of cluster @xmath27 , namely @xmath26 , is the minimum among all the centroids of @xmath23 clusters .",
    "( iii ) update the centroid of each cluster according to eq .",
    "[ centroid ] .",
    "( iv ) repeat steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) until all the centroids can not be modified .",
    "note that for a given @xmath23 , clusters will depend heavily on the initial configuration of the set of centroids , thus making interpretation of the clusters rather uncertain .",
    "different initialization may lead to different solutions which may trapped in the local minimum .",
    "clusters should be , as much as possible , compact , well separated , and interpretable , possibly with the help of some additional variables , such as the @xmath17-statistic .",
    "here we only focus on whether the clusters are compact , namely the vectors ( nodes ) within one cluster are close ( similar ) enough , while neglect if the clusters are well separated .",
    "therefore we will finally choose the clustering result subject to the lowest @xmath4 among @xmath30-possible solutions ( we set @xmath31 in this paper ) .",
    "another crucial problem in the process of coarse graining is how to update the links weights after merging the nodes so that the resulting network is truly representative of the initial one .",
    "an effective weighting strategy was proposed by gfeller _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we apply it to directed networks . specifically , when we merge the nodes in cluster @xmath27 to form a new node labeled by @xmath32 , the weights of the merged links update according to the following principle : @xmath33 where @xmath34 indicates the weight of the directed link from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , which can also be interpreted as the coupling strength .",
    "a simple illustration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the initial network as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) is constituted of seven nodes and eight directed links . assuming the initial links weights are all equal to unit . after merging the three nodes @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,",
    "a new node @xmath38 is generated , and according to eq .",
    "[ weight ] the links weights in the reduced network are drawn as in fig .  [ fig1](b ) . indeed , since the three nodes in total receive three in - links from node @xmath39 , while two from node @xmath40 , the weights of @xmath38 s two in - links are respectively @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath38 s out - links , since the three nodes have two out - links to node @xmath43 and one to @xmath44 , the weight are respectively @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "numbers on the links indicate the new weights of the links.,width=302 ]    under the framework of master stability analysis , the synchronizability of an undirected network can be quantified by the ratio between the largest and the smallest non - zero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of this network , namely @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively the largest and the smallest non - zero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix  @xcite . in directed networks , since the laplacian matrix , defined as @xmath50 , is asymmetric with zero rowsum",
    ", it has complex eigenvalues . in order to achieve the synchronization condition , every eigenvalue is entirely contained in the region of negative lyapunov exponent for the particular master stability function .",
    "once the stability zone is bounded and the imaginary part of complex eigenvalue is small enough , the network synchronizability can be approximately measured by the real part of eigenvalue ratio @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are respectively the largest and the second smallest real parts of eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the stronger the synchronizability , the smaller the ratio @xmath54 .",
    "note that an accurate index for measuring the synchronizability in directed networks has not yet been proposed and asks for further studies .",
    "here , we use the approximate index @xmath51 as an indicator to see whether the synchronizability of a directed network changes after coarse graining .",
    "usually @xmath55 is proportional to the largest degree @xmath56 ( i.e. , largest node s strength in weighted network ) of the network and @xmath57 corresponds to the lowest degree @xmath58 ( i.e. , lowest node s strength in weighted network )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , keeping the @xmath56 and @xmath58 unchanged can effectively help to maintain the synchronizability after coarse graining .",
    "thus , in the coarse graining process , the nodes with largest and smallest in - degrees can only be merged if the @xmath56 and @xmath58 of the coarse - grained network are respectively equal to that of the initial network .",
    "otherwise , we will randomly selected two nodes , one with largest in - degree and the other with the smallest in - degree , before group partition",
    ". then the rest @xmath59 nodes will be classified into @xmath60 groups according to k - means clustering .",
    "note that , unless stated otherwise , @xmath61 always refers to the in - degree . in appendix",
    ", we further discuss the effect of the constraint of keeping @xmath56 and @xmath58 on coarse graining results .",
    "it shows that the eigenvalue ratio @xmath54 is sensitive to @xmath56 and @xmath58 , while the order parameter of kuramoto model does not .",
    "finally , for the aspect of computational complexity , the k - means clustering algorithm is of @xmath62 , and the time complexity of calculating the impact - vector @xmath17 is @xmath63 .",
    "likewise , the calculation of eigenvectors in scg method also takes @xmath63 .",
    "however , with the development of computing techniques , lots of fast calculation algorithms can help to reduce the computational complexity and make our method be able to deal with large networks .",
    "for example , the computational complexity of katz index ( i.e. , the case for @xmath64 ) can be reduced to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of edges in the network  @xcite .",
    "we apply the path - based coarse graining ( pcg ) approach to four kinds of directed networks : ( i ) directed tree network . a tree with @xmath20 nodes and @xmath30 layers",
    "is generated starting from a directed train with length @xmath30 , in which each node represents a layer .",
    "then rest @xmath67 nodes are added one by one .",
    "each new added node is connected by a directed link starting from one of its ancestors which are not located in the layer @xmath30 .",
    "( ii ) a variant of barabsi - albert networks  @xcite : directed ba network . an acyclic directed ba network is generated by using the mechanism for undirected ba network and assuming the link direction can only from older node to younger node .",
    "( iii ) a variant of watts - strogatz networks  @xcite : directed ws network .",
    "the model starts from a completely regular network with identical degree and clockwise links .",
    "each link will be rewired with two randomly selected nodes with probability @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "( iv ) a variant of erds - rnyi networks  @xcite : directed er random network .",
    "the directed er random networks can be generated by setting @xmath70 .",
    "firstly , we investigate the performance of pcg on above four kinds of networks .",
    "the synchronizability of the coarse - grained network @xmath54 in the @xmath71 plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where @xmath23 is the size of the coarse - grained network .",
    "interestingly , we find that in tree network and acyclic ba network larger @xmath14 in average provides better results than smaller @xmath14 .",
    "especially , in tree network there is an obvious line at @xmath72 . in the ba network , with @xmath73",
    "the coarse - grained network can keep the synchronizability exactly the same as the initial network . in the cyclic ws network the @xmath14 that best preserves",
    "the synchronizability is around 0.1 .",
    "it seems that networks with more loops tend to obtain better coarse graining with smaller @xmath14 ( see subsection c for detailed discussion of the relationship between the optimal parameter @xmath74 and the number of loops in network ) .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) shows that the synchronizability of the coarse - grained er network is not sensitive to @xmath14 regardless of @xmath23 , since the total fluctuation is smaller than 0.07 .",
    "we compare the pcg method with other two methods , namely random coarse graining ( rcg ) and spectral coarse graining ( scg )  @xcite . in rcg , the @xmath20 elements of each node s vector are randomly selected in the range of ( 0,1 ) .",
    "then the nodes will be classified into @xmath23 groups by using k - means clustering . in directed networks ,",
    "the egeinvalues and egeinvectors of their laplacian matrixes have complex values .",
    "when we apply scg to directed networks , we consider only the real parts of the values in this paper . in practice , we define @xmath75 equally distributed intervals between the maximum and minimum of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the egeinvectors corresponding to the second smallest and the largest real - part - egeinvalues of the laplacian matrix , respectively . the nodes",
    "whose eigenvector components in @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) fall in the same interval are merged .",
    "specifically , if the elements in both @xmath78 and @xmath79 are identical , we will randomly divide the nodes into @xmath23 groups . actually , the relation between @xmath75 and @xmath23 strongly depends on the network structure ( i.e. , the distribution of the elements in @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "for instance , considering the initial ws and er network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , when @xmath80 the size of the coarse - grained ws network is 951 , while the reduced er network only contains 281 clusters .",
    "note that there are many potential ways to apply the scg method to directed networks making use of the imaginary part of the elements in eigenvectors .",
    "for example , the vectors @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) can be generated by combining the real part and the imaginary part ( such as @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , et al . ) .",
    "another way is grouping the nodes according to four vectors , namely @xmath84 .",
    "if the imaginary parts are appropriately considered , the performance of scg can be improved .",
    "however , how to find the right way to make use of the imaginary parts is a tough problem and inappropriately involving the imaginary parts in scg method may lead to even worse results .",

    "the coupling strength is @xmath107 and @xmath108 is randomly selected in the range of @xmath109 .",
    "initially , @xmath110 is randomly chosen in @xmath111.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] +    in addition , we point out that grouping the nodes aiming at preserving the dynamics can not maintain the topological properties at the same time , although the grouping is according to the topological similarity .",
    "generally , the average degree of the coarse - grained network is larger than that of the initial network . for comparison",
    ", we generate a group of modeled networks which have the same topological properties as the initial network and same size as the coarse - grained network .",
    "it is shown that the average number of reachable nodes and loop number of the coarse - grained networks are always higher than that of the modeled networks , while the average shortest distance of the coarse - grained networks is always smaller than the modeled networks . moreover",
    ", the coarse graining procedure may change the degree distribution of the initial networks .",
    "however , the topological properties of the pcg networks are relatively closer to the initial networks than the scg networks especially in the acyclic networks ( not so obvious in directed networks with cycles ) . for example",
    ", the pcg method can prevent the producing of loops and keep the coarse - grained networks still partial reachable .",
    "since the laplacian matrixes for directed networks are asymmetric , the egeinvalues @xmath57 and @xmath55 are complex . in this case",
    ", the indicator @xmath54 can not exactly represent the synchronizability of a network .",
    "hence , we further test our method with the kuramoto model  @xcite , which is a classical model to investigate the phase synchronization phenomena . the coupled kuramoto model in the network can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the natural frequency and the phase of oscillator @xmath27 respectively , and @xmath11 is the adjacency matrix .",
    "the collective dynamics of the whole population is measured by the macroscopic complex order parameter , @xmath115 where the modulus @xmath116 ( @xmath117 $ ] ) measures the phase coherence of the population and @xmath118 is the average phase . @xmath119 and @xmath120 describe the limits in which all oscillators are respectively phase locked and moving incoherently . by studying the behavior of the order parameter @xmath116",
    ", we are able to investigate whether the topology of the coarse - grained network is representative of the initial one .",
    "the initial network is a tree network as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , which contains 100 nodes and has 10 layers . after the pcg procedure",
    ", we obtain a train - like network with depth equal to 10 , see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . with the scg method",
    ", a cyclic network will be generated as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "the result of how the order parameter @xmath116 of kuramoto model performs in these three networks is shown in fig.[fig3](d ) .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath116 of the pcg network converges with almost the same speed as the initial one , while in the scg network it converges faster .",
    "moreover , the results of directed ws network and ba network are respectively shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](e ) and ( f ) .",

    "( b ) the @xmath122 as function of the reshuffling steps .",
    "each point is obtained by averaging over @xmath100 independent network realizations.,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]    in different networks , the optimal parameters @xmath74 corresponding to the best performance on coarse graining are different .",
    "empirically , the @xmath74 of acyclic networks is larger than that of those containing loops . to investigate whether @xmath122 is affected by the cycles in networks ,",
    "we carry out an experiment based on directed ba networks , on which loops are generated by reshuffling some links . specifically , we randomly select two directed links from the network , for example , one is from node @xmath11 to @xmath123 and the other is from node @xmath124 to @xmath125",
    ". then we rewired these two links as @xmath11 to @xmath125 and @xmath124 to @xmath123 .",
    "in this way , the degree of these nodes will not be changed during the reshuffling procedure . in average , reshuffling more links leads to more loops , see an example in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) where the numbers of loops with length 3 , 4 and 5 all increase with the increasing of reshuffling steps .",
    "now , we would like to find the optimal parameters for the reshuffled networks .",
    "for a given network , @xmath74 might be different with different @xmath23 as we have shown in fig .",
    "however , in practice , checking the optimal parameter for different @xmath23 in advance is sometimes impossible .",
    "thus , we here ignore the relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath23 , and consider the general performances of one parameter on the coarse - grained networks with the possible sizes we concerned .",
    "the @xmath122 is thus corresponding to the @xmath14 that yields the minimum synchronizability difference between the coarse - grained networks and the initial networks , which can be mathematically expressed by : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the synchronizability of the coarse - grained network with @xmath23 nodes , @xmath128 is the synchronizability of the initial network and @xmath129 is the minimum size of the coarse - grained network that we considered . since too small @xmath23 may lead to dramatic change of @xmath54 , here we choose @xmath130 in the example shown in fig .",
    "we obtain @xmath122 subject to the minimum @xmath39 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath122 on the number of reshuffling steps is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . instead of considering all possible @xmath14 which is very time consuming , we test the parameter @xmath14 in the range of [ 0.01,10 ] with step 0.01 , 0.1 and 1 respectively in [ 0.01,0.1 ) , [ 0.1,1 ) and [ 1,10 ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath122 decreases with the increasing of reshuffling steps .",
    "actually , if directed networks have obvious hierarchical structure and rare loops , pcg can perform better with a relatively large @xmath14 since it emphasizes on long path to detect the hierarchical structure .",
    "however , in directed networks with many loops , the hierarchical structure is not clear . as a path involved in loops",
    "can be regarded as an infinite long path , its effect on the impact - vector will be enormously amplified with a large @xmath14 , and thus leading to noise when characterizing the dynamic role of a node . in this case , it is better to pay more attention to the impacts from local structure , namely emphasize the effects of short paths by using small @xmath14 .",
    "coarse graining is an effective way to analyze and visualize large networks .",
    "many methods and models have been proposed to reduce the size of the networks and preserve main properties such as degree distribution , cluster coefficient , degree correlation , as well as some dynamic behaviors such as random walks , synchronizability and critical phenomena .",
    "however , most of these works take into account the undirected networks , while the study on coarse graining of directed networks lacks of attention . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a path - based coarse graining ( pcg ) method which assumes that two nodes are structural - similar if they obtain the same impacts from other nodes , and thus they are more likely to be merged during the coarse graining process . the impacts that a node obtained from other nodes are calculated via tracing the origin of impacts in directed network .",
    "specifically , the impact of node @xmath5 on node @xmath6 is defined by summing over the collection of directed paths from @xmath5 to @xmath6 with exponential weights by length , which are controlled by a parameter @xmath14 .",
    "larger @xmath14 indicates the long paths are more important ( i.e. , assign more weights to the long paths ) . numerical analysis on four kinds of directed networks , including tree - like networks and variants of barabsi - albert networks , watts - strogatz networks and erds - rnyi networks , shows that our method can effectively preserve the synchronizability during the coarse graining process .",
    "this result is further demonstrated by the kuramoto model .",
    "in addition , we find that the long paths play more important roles on the coarse graining in the tree - like networks , while in the cyclic networks , the long paths that involve the loops usually have negative effects on quantifying the impacts of one node on the other nodes during the coarse graining process , and thus a smaller parameter @xmath14 gives better performance .",
    "finally , we claim that the idea for merging nodes which receive the same impacts from the network is quite general for coarse graining directed networks .",
    "for example , for random walk , two nodes in a directed network having exactly the same upstream neighbors should be grouped together since their random walker probabilities come from the same sources . in this sense ,",
    "coarse graining directed networks for other dynamics can be interesting extensions .",
    "we thank yi - cheng zhang , tao zhou and jie ren for their helpful suggestions .",
    "this work is supported by the swiss national science foundation under grant no .",
    "( 200020 - 132253 ) .",
    "in the paper , we assumed that the nodes with largest and smallest in - degrees can only be merged if the @xmath56 and @xmath58 of the coarse - grained network are respectively equal to that of the initial network . in order to investigate the effect of keeping the maximum and minimum in - degree on the coarse graining result",
    ", we remove the constraint of @xmath131 and @xmath132 in pcg and see the performance of the modified pcg method .",
    "as we mainly consider synchronization , the indicator @xmath54 is shown to be sensitive to the @xmath131 and @xmath132 , see fig .",
    "it is obvious that the pcg with constraint performs better than that without constraint .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the order parameter @xmath116 of the kuramoto model does not show obvious differences .",
    "moreover , we compared the rcg with and without the in - degree constraint .",
    "the result shows that the degree constraint can not prominently improve the performance of rcg .",
