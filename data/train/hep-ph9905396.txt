    "leptoquark particles appear in extensions of the standard model like grand unified theories , composite models and r - parity violating supersymmetry .",
    "they carry both lepton and baryon number .",
    "these particles mediate transition between quark and lepton .",
    "leptoquarks can be scalar ( spin= 0 ) or vector ( spin=1 ) and couple to leptons via a yukawa type coupling .",
    "these particles conserve lepton and baryon number in order to avoid a fast proton decay .",
    "one can classify the different leptoquark through their spin , weak isospin and fermion number , see details in @xcite .    in the following we consider only pair production of scalar leptoquarks : almost no dependence on the @xmath6 coupling",
    "is expected ( coupling to lepton and quark ) .",
    "the leptoquark resonance width can be defined as ( @xcite ) :    @xmath7    we obtain @xmath8 2 gev for @xmath6 = @xmath9 and m@xmath10 = 1200 gev .",
    "as we will see later the theoretical width is overwhelmed by the calorimeter resolution .",
    "if we assume that leptoquarks have either left or right couplings but not both , the branching fraction is 0 , 0.5 or 1 for symmetry reason .",
    "we consider both electron and muon leptoquark type with br(lq@xmath11 @xmath2 e q ) = 1 or br(lq@xmath11 @xmath2 e q ) = 0.5 and br(lq@xmath12 @xmath2 @xmath13 q ) = 1 or br(lq@xmath12",

    "fig.1 shows the leading - order diagrams for the leptoquark pair production at lhc .",
    "one can notice that except for the diagram of the type @xmath14 via e - exchange , all the other processes do not depend on the @xmath6 coupling ( only vertex @xmath15 ) .",
    "this is very important as the cross section then depend mainly on the mass of the leptoquark .",
    "we take the total cross section for the leptoquark pair production from @xcite ( next - to - leading order calculations ( nlo ) using cteq4 m structure function ) .",
    "the difference between lo ( as in pythia @xcite ) and nlo can reach @xmath16 depending on the leptoquark mass .",
    "thus nlo cross section is taken for our analysis .",
    "the current limit on the leptoquark originates from hera and tevatron @xcite analysis . at the tevatron",
    "the exclusion limit for nlo cross section is investigated by both cdf and do @xcite . combining both results",
    "one obtains : m@xmath17 246 gev .",
    "we can expect at @xmath18 = 2 tev with l = 1 fb@xmath3 for the tevatron ( d0+cdf ) a limit of m@xmath17 350 gev .    at lep",
    "the exclusion limit was investigated , e.g. , by opal using the fact that the leptoquark enhances the cross section of e@xmath19e@xmath20 @xmath21 in t / u channel exchange @xcite .",
    "a preliminary study carried out in cms @xcite showed that the mass reach is about 1.5 tev @xcite .",
    "several studies have been done to evaluate the lhc performance of leptoquark detection : @xcite .",
    "the study presented in this note includes a more accurate detector performance description ( as will be explained in next section ) , takes into account all sources of background and includes superposition of events at high luminosity ( so called pileup ) .",
    "fig.2 shows the full geant simulation of a 900 gev leptoquark pair decay into electron ( positron ) and u ( @xmath22 ) quark jet ( @xmath23 ) in the cms detector .     for m@xmath24 = 900 gev.,height=377 ]    the cmsjet fast monte - carlo package @xcite",
    "is used to model the cms detector response due to the huge sample of events to be processed ( about 20 millions at generator level and half a million at the simulation level ) .",
    "the fast simulation incorporates the full granularity of the calorimeter with an energy smearing according to geant simulation and parameterization of the longitudinal and lateral profiles of showers with some cracks description ( transition regions of calorimeter : endcap - barrel , endcap - forward calorimeter ) , charged particles and the muon resolution is parameterized as function of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "here we illustrate the performance of the fast simulation with some distributions in fig.3 , where the 1 tev jet response is produced by both fast simulation with cmsjet and full detector simulation with cmsim @xcite .",
    "we compare the energy resolution , transverse energy distribution ( i. e. the ratio of the energy contained in a cone of @xmath27 value to the total energy ) and the fraction of the jet energy deposited in electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "-90     [ fig10 ]    .",
    "the background processes considered in the following are required to have 2 isolated high - p@xmath28 leptons and at least 2 energetic jets . due to the large qcd cross section , semileptonic decays of heavy flavour",
    "are also considered requiring isolated high - p@xmath28 leptons ( coming from jets ) .    in tab.1",
    "we give the cross section for some processes where the production of 2 leptons and 2 jets is forced in pythia .",
    "for some processes with a very large total cross section the generated samples are subdivided in several @xmath29 intervals .    due to the large qcd cross section",
    "a special treatment is applied for those events .",
    "after parton generation and hadronization each meson with sufficient value of p@xmath28 is decayed 1000 times in order to select events where at least 2 high - p@xmath28 leptons ( p@xmath30 40 gev ) of same flavour and opposite sign ( sf os ) are produced ( see tab.2 ) .",
    "once passes this requirement the qcd event is processed through cmsjet simulation .",
    "this procedure increases the generated statistics by a factor 1000 . after this simulation",
    "no qcd event survives the first level selection : 2 isolated high - p@xmath28 leptons ( p@xmath30 40 gev in @xmath31 2.4 ) of opposite sign and same flavour and at least 2 jets ( e@xmath30 40 gev in @xmath31 4.5 )",

    "in order to obtain the width we fit the mass distribution for signal only with a gaussian , as the energy resolution dominates over the intrinsic breit wigner . the leptoquark mass can be approximately described as :    @xmath33    from this relation we can deduce that @xmath34 due to the excellent lepton energy resolution in cms . therefore the width of the leptoquark peak is approximately a half of the jet energy resolution . for high masses , high energy jets and excluding the hadron forward calorimeter(hf ) region ( @xmath35 ) , we expect the constant term to dominate the jet energy resolution .",
    "this means that we have ( outside of cracks and barrel - endcap region ) :    @xmath36 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the fig.7 , where , for example , we obtain @xmath37 = 42 gev for m@xmath10 = 1.3 tev .",

    "the underestimation of the leptoquark mass is mainly due to the finite cone jetfinder and to be corrected by calibration procedure .",
    "the scalar leptoquark is expected to be observed in cms detector up to m@xmath10 @xmath0 1.5 tev for 100 fb@xmath3 and assuming br(lq @xmath2 e q ) = 100 % .",
    "the study of the electron and muon leptoquark type gives similar results .",
    "the width of the leptoquark mass peak depends on the leptoquark mass and is expected to be about @xmath37 = 42 gev at m@xmath10 = 1.3 tev .",
    "pileup effect has limited influence , reducing mainly the lepton isolation efficiency and shifting @xmath40e@xmath28 value .",
