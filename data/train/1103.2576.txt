    "[ algorithms ] suppose that @xmath99 is a knot .",

    ", there is an algorithm to construct the finite set of boundary slopes of all embedded normal surfaces and hence in particular of properly embedded orientable incompressible and boundary incompressible surfaces , which can be isotoped to be normal .",
    "these occur as slopes of the finite set of vertices of the projective solution space of normal surfaces in a one vertex triangulation of @xmath2 .",
    "next , by doubling @xmath2 , we obtain a closed manifold @xmath463 with a one vertex triangulation which is symmetric under the involution interchanging the two copies of @xmath2 .",
    "we claim that if there is an incompressible and boundary incompressible orientable surface @xmath24 at some slope @xmath464 of @xmath0 , then there is a closed orientable incompressible surface @xmath112 at a vertex of the projective solution space of @xmath463 , where @xmath465 is similarly incompressible and boundary incompressible in @xmath2 and has the same slope @xmath464 as @xmath24 .",
    "since there are finitely many vertex solutions , each can be checked to see if it has an even rational or even integer boundary slope of intersections with the torus @xmath103 and if it is incompressible , using standard techniques as discussed in either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "hence the algorithm to check if a knot satisfies the even or strong even boundary slope conjectures is complete , once we have verified the claim above .",
    "but the proof of the claim is also straightforward . given @xmath24 , it is obvious that @xmath466 is a closed orientable incompressible surface in @xmath463 meeting @xmath103 in essential curves at slope @xmath464 . as usual , we can isotope @xmath466 to be least weight normal and then using @xcite write a multiple of the normal class of @xmath466 as a sum of vertex solutions , each of which is incompressible .",
    "so it remains to see why we can assume that these vertex solutions give at least one surface of the form @xmath112 which meets @xmath103 at slope @xmath464 .",
    "but this follows by @xcite .",
    "for there , a key result is that if a properly embedded normal surface in @xmath2 at slope @xmath464 is written as a haken sum , then the summands must either have the same slope @xmath464 or a unique associated slope @xmath467 .",
    "the slope @xmath467 has the property that the sum of normal curves representing @xmath464 and @xmath467 represents a multiple of the trivial curve in a one - vertex triangulation of a torus .",
    "but in our case , it is easy to see that no associated slopes can occur since clearly our least weight normal surface in the isotopy class of @xmath466 has no trivial curves of intersection with @xmath103 .",
    "hence we conclude that all the vertex solutions obtained by decomposing a multiple of @xmath466 are either disjoint from @xmath103 or meet @xmath103 with slope @xmath464 and there must be at least one surface @xmath112 of the latter type .",
    "note that @xmath465 is boundary incompressible , since it is orientable and therefore a boundary compression would imply the existence of a compression .",
    "so this completes the discussion of the even and strong even boundary slope algorithms .",
    "we now consider the neuwirth conjecture and strong neuwirth conjectures for a knot @xmath99 .",
    "suppose that there is an orientable incompressible and boundary incompressible surface @xmath468 with @xmath469 consisting of two curves with integer slope .",
    "the key idea is to use fundamental normal solutions rather than vertex normal solutions . recall that a fundamental normal surface @xmath3 has the property that @xmath3 can not be written as a haken sum of two non - empty normal surfaces .",
    "haken ( @xcite ) proved that there is a finite set of constructible fundamental normal surfaces in any closed triangulated @xmath71-manifold .",
    "the procedure is similar to the case of the boundary slope conjectures .",
    "namely given @xmath24 , we can assume that @xmath466 is a closed orientable incompressible least weight surface in its isotopy class in @xmath463 .",
    "moreover we still have the key property that @xmath470 consists of two copies of an essential curve with integer boundary slope . now",
    "if we write @xmath466 as a sum of least weight fundamental normal surfaces , using @xcite , it follows that each of these is again a closed orientable incompressible surface in @xmath463 .",
    "but we can also deduce from @xcite that each of these summands either is disjoint from @xmath103 or meets @xmath103 in essential curves at the same slope as @xmath24 .",
    "( as usual , since all these surfaces are least weight , no trivial curves of intersection with @xmath103 can occur ) .",
    "moreover it is easy to see using an elementary homology argument on @xmath103 that the total number of curves of intersection of all the summands with @xmath103 must be two .",
    "hence we see that either one summand has two such curves or two summands have one curve of intersection each .",
    "the first case gives us the result required - by checking all fundamental solutions we search for one with two intersection curves with @xmath103 which is incompressible .",
    "it then splits along @xmath103 into two surfaces each of which is a neuwirth surface for @xmath0 . in the second case , splitting a surface with one curve of intersection with @xmath103 gives two spanning surfaces for @xmath0 which must be either orientable seifert surfaces , in which case the boundary slope of @xmath24 is longitudinal , or are non orientable . in the latter case , as usual ,",
    "a boundary of a regular neighbourhood of such a surface is the required neuwirth surface .",
    "hence we have proved that there is an algorithm to verify the neuwirth conjecture in all cases except where the boundary slope is longitudinal .",
    "for the final case , suppose that the neuwirth surface @xmath24 we seek is longitudinal .",
    "in this case we have to complete the argument in case @xmath466 splits as a sum of fundamental solutions so that two of them have one curve of intersection with @xmath103 and split along @xmath103 into orientable seifert surfaces for @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that these two fundamental surfaces have different normal classes , so that when they are combined by a haken sum , a connected normal surface is obtained .",
    "but then there is a simple algorithm to complete the problem .",
    "namely search amongst fundamental normal surfaces in @xmath463 for ones which meet @xmath103 in one longitudinal curve . for pairs of such surfaces",
    "check whether their haken sum is incompressible and connected .",
    "such a surface will then split along @xmath103 into two longitudinal neuwirth surfaces as required .",
    "it remains to discuss the strong neuwirth conjecture .",
    "this is very similar to the argument for the neuwirth conjecture .",
    "assume that @xmath24 is a non - orientable surface at an even integer boundary slope in @xmath2 , so that @xmath471 is incompressible and boundary incompressible in @xmath2 .",
    "by @xcite , we can write @xmath472=\\sigma n_i[f_i ] $ ] where @xmath473 are fundamental normal surfaces in @xmath463 and @xmath474 are positive integers . by the arguments in the previous paragraphs",
    ", it follows that there must be some @xmath475 so that @xmath476 and @xmath477 meets @xmath103 in a single curve at the same boundary slope as @xmath24 .",

    "( this follows since the results of @xcite on boundary slopes apply to normal surfaces , not just incompressible normal surfaces ) .",
    "we see that if @xmath477 is split along @xmath103 , the result is either non - orientable spanning surfaces at the same boundary slope as @xmath24 or seifert surfaces , if the slope of @xmath24 is longitudinal .",

    ", we want to apply @xcite .",
    "the equation @xmath472=\\sigma n_i[f_i ] $ ] implies @xmath479 = 2[2s]=\\sigma 2n_i[f_i ] $ ] .",

    "<S> neuwirth asked if any non - trivial knot in the 3-sphere can be embedded in a closed surface so that the complement of the surface is a connected essential surface for the knot complement . in this paper , we examine some variations on this question and prove it for all knots up to 11 crossings except for two examples . </S>",
    "<S> we also establish the conjecture for all montesinos knots and for all generalized arborescently alternating knots . for knot exteriors containing closed incompressible surfaces satisfying a simple homological condition </S>",
    "<S> , we establish that the knots satisfy the neuwirth conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> if there is a proper degree one map from knot @xmath0 to knot @xmath1 and @xmath1 satisfies the neuwirth conjecture then we prove the same is true for knot @xmath0 . </S>",
