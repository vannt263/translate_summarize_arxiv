    "the decay mode of an atomic nucleus in which two of the orbital electrons are captured by two protons and two neutrinos are emitted in the process is called two neutrinos double - electron capture ( 2@xmath3dec )  @xcite . equation  ( [ eq : ecec2v ] ) shows the decay process .",
    "@xmath4 where z is the atomic number , and a is the atomic mass number for a given nucleus .",
    "the positive results were reported by a geochemical experiment  @xcite for @xmath5ba with a half - life of ( 2.2@xmath60.5)@xmath110@xmath2 years and a noble gas experiment  @xcite for @xmath7kr with a half - life of ( 9.2@xmath8(stat)@xmath61.3(syst))@xmath110@xmath2 years .",
    "the 2@xmath3dec process is allowed by the standard model of particle physics and no conservation laws ( including lepton number conservation ) are violated .",
    "if two electrons are captured by two protons in the nucleus , and neutrinos are _ not _ emitted , the process is called neutrinoless double - electron capture ( 0@xmath3dec )  @xcite in which the lepton number is _ not _ conserved , and the neutrino is its own antiparticle , a majorana particle .",
    "if observed , this mode of decay described in equation  ( [ eq:0vecec ] ) would require new particle physics beyond the standard model .",
    "@xmath9    the experimental study of this process is very challenging due to its extremely long lifetime .",
    "this is because the decay process is expected to be accompanied by an internal bremsstrahlung gamma quantum and the final nucleus is in an excited state , which strongly suppresses the allowed decay phase space  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to neutrinoless double - beta decay , a rare process used as a powerful tool to test neutrino properties and lepton number violation with several on - going experiments  @xcite , neutrinoless double - electron capture appears to be extremely slow as pointed out by vergados , j.d .",
    "@xcite and discussed in detail by doi , m. and kotani , t.  @xcite .",
    "however , a possible resonant 0@xmath3dec process in which the close degeneracy of the initial and final ( excited ) atomic states can enhance the decay rate by a factor as large as 10@xmath10  @xcite , which might occur , has been studied by many authors  @xcite . the 0@xmath3dec might be realized as a resonant decay  @xcite or as a radiative process with or without a resonance condition  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mech ] shows an example of 0@xmath3dec with @xmath0xe .        nonetheless , the 2@xmath3dec process is a standard nuclear process and it should be detected experimentally by measuring its half - life , as expressed below : @xmath11 where @xmath12@xmath132@xmath110@xmath14y@xmath15 is the dimensional factor , f@xmath16 is the phase - space factor ( proportional to q@xmath17 ) , and m@xmath16 is the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) .",
    "the measurement of the two x - ray energies and the half - life of the 2@xmath3dec decay ( t@xmath18 ) to the ground state is of great interest to nuclear physics .",
    "of particular interest is , how the double @xmath19 vacancy refills after the capture of two electrons by two protons in the nucleus occurred .",
    "measuring the total energy from x - rays can shed some light on the precise mechanism of this atomic decay process .",
    "moreover , if the mass difference between the initial and final states is greater than twice the mass of electron ( 1.022 mev ) , the reaction q value is enough to initiate another mode of decay , which would be electron capture and positron emission .",
    "this decay mode occurs in competition with double - electron capture and their branching ratio depends on nuclear properties , which is of great interest .",
    "furthermore , when the mass difference is greater than four electron masses ( 2.044 mev ) , the third mode - double - positron decay - can occur as well .",
    "however , only 6 naturally occurring nuclides can decay via these three modes simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0xe , discussed below , is one of them .",
    "therefore , measuring the decay modes of @xmath0xe has particular meaning in nuclear physics .",
    "in addition , the model predictions for 0@xmath3dec half - life require the evaluation of nuclear matrix elements .",
    "these calculations are complicated and have large uncertainties .",
    "they are different from those required for 2@xmath3dec .",
    "however , within the same model framework , some constraints on the 0@xmath3dec nme0@xmath3 can be derived using knowledge of the 2@xmath3dec nme2@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "also , the nme2@xmath3 , which is extracted from the measurement of the half - life of 2@xmath3dec , can be directly compared with the nme2@xmath3 from predictions  @xcite .",
    "a good agreement would indicate that the reaction mechanisms and the nuclear structure aspects that are involved in 2@xmath3dec are well understood .",
    "2@xmath3dec has large q - values , but the decay to ground state in the final nucleus releases only x rays and auger electrons , making its detection difficult . at their energy range ( @xmath131 to @xmath13100 kev ) , the background is usually high .",
    "thus , the experimental detection of double electron capture with 2@xmath3 emission is more difficult than 2@xmath3 double beta decay , which has been observed for a variety of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , experiments directly searching for dark matter require ultra - low background events in the low energy region ( down to @xmath131 to @xmath13100 kev ) .",
    "this lays the foundation to experimentally measure 2@xmath3dec process for the first time . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the detection of 2@xmath3dec with @xmath0xe in the dark matter experiments with natural xenon as targets , such as xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite , and lux - zeplin ( lz )  @xcite .",
    "natural xenon possesses @xmath0xe at an abundance of 0.1%  @xcite .",
    "the process for 2@xmath3dec of @xmath0xe is : @xmath20    the reaction q value is 2864 kev . for the ground state of @xmath0xe to the ground state of @xmath0te , the detectable x rays are 31.8 kev from @xmath0te , for a one - step process in which the two @xmath19-shell electrons are captured simultaneously by two protons in the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear recoil energy of @xmath0xe allocated in the decay process is on the order of @xmath1330 ev , which is negligible .",
    "the predicted half - life for 2@xmath3dec is 2.9@xmath110@xmath2 years  @xcite for a ground state to ground state process .",
    "since the reaction q value in equation  ( [ eq : xe124 ] ) is 2864 kev , the two other decay modes - electron capture with positron ( 2@xmath21ec ) emission and double positron decay ( 2@xmath22 ) can simultaneously occur with double electron capture .",
    "the available energies are shown below : @xmath23 however , the 2@xmath3dec rate is much faster than 2@xmath21ec and 2@xmath22 as discussed in refs  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath24xe has also a natural abundance of 0.09% and can only undergo a 2@xmath3dec or a 0@xmath3dec decay , @xmath24xe@xmath25@xmath24te , with @xmath24te at its ground state and the total decay q value of 896 kev . because this decay q value , 896 kev , is a factor of 3.2 smaller than the q value , 2864 kev , from @xmath0xe decays ,",
    "the @xmath24xe 2@xmath3dec is much slower than @xmath0xe 2@xmath3dec decay .",
    "therefore , we will not discuss @xmath24xe 2@xmath3dec in this paper .",
    "the average upper limit in an experiment with background can be obtained using the unified approach proposed by g. feldman and r. cousins  @xcite . for a detector with @xmath0xe target ,",
    "the upper limit of the half - life can be derived using the following equations  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fraction of 2@xmath19 captures accompanied by the emission of two @xmath19 x rays , @xmath28 is the efficiency of the detection at a full energy peak , @xmath29 is the isotopic abundance of @xmath0xe , and m is the total mass of the target .",
    "n@xmath30 is avogadro constant , a is the atomic mass number of @xmath0xe , @xmath31 is the live time of measurements in days , @xmath32 is a constant that equals to 1.64 at 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) , @xmath33 is the background rate per unit energy , and @xmath34 is the energy window around the peak position .      the xenon100 dark matter experiment reported their dark matter analysis with a 34 kg active target of liquid xenon  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic background events in the region of interest was reported as 5.3@xmath110@xmath35 events/(kgdaykev ) .",
    "we analyzed the xenon100 electromagnetic background data with a digitized spectrum , as shown in figure  [ fig : xenon100analysis ] , from the published background spectra ( figure 3 and figure 12 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) between 0 to 100 kev . a peak - searching algorithm , wavelet transform  @xcite , was applied in searching for peaks and no peak was found in the region of interest as shown in figure  [ fig : xenon100analysis ] .",
    "consequently , an average background rate , 5.3@xmath110@xmath35 events/(kgdaykev ) , was used in the calculation of the background index , events/(kevday ) , in table  [ tab : xenon100 ] .",
    "the width of the region of interest , @xmath36e = 7.94 kev , is determined using @xmath32@xmath1@xmath37 , where @xmath32 equals 1.64 at 90% c.l . and",
    "@xmath38 = 0.009 + 0.485/@xmath39  @xcite is energy resolution , @xmath40 is the sum of the expected two x - rays ( 2@xmath131.8 kev ) from @xmath0te . in addition , gavrilyuk et al .",
    "reported that the energy released in the refilling of a double k - vacancy is not equal to the sum of two single vacancies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a possible reduction of the total energy release ( 2@xmath131.8 kev ) was taken into account , using an energy window of 7.94 kev , in our analysis .",
    "this possible energy reduction is from fluorescence yield , which might not be detectable in liquid xenon , induced by the emission of auger electrons .",
    "because the position resolution is less than 3 mm  @xcite , the detection efficiency for two x - rays can be 90% since the the mean free path of x - rays with energy of 31.8 kev in liquid xenon is about 0.5 mm .",
    "the determined analysis parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : xenon100 ] .",
    "using equations  ( 6-[eq : sens ] ) and the values given in table  [ tab : xenon100 ] , the half - life limit of @xmath0xe 2@xmath3dec to its ground state is determined to be 1.66@xmath110@xmath2 years with a 90% c.l .",
    "( 1.64@xmath37 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : plot1 ] .",
    ".the experimental parameters and values . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     using the radioactivity levels in table  [ tab : lux ] , a simple monte carlo simulation was performed to predict the signal events from @xmath0xe dec process together with several significant sources of background from pmts , figure  [ fig : plot2 ] shows the predicted results .",
    "the proposed lux - zeplin ( lz ) experiment will contain 7 tons of liquid xenon  @xcite . although the mass of xenon in lz is only 20 times greater than in lux  @xcite , the expected sensitivity of lz will exceed that of lux by over two orders of magnitude .",
    "the additional sensitivity , which is greater than a simple scaling of xenon mass , is due primarily to improved background suppression .",
    "this , in turn , enables a longer running time for the lz experiment and allows a larger effective fiducial mass fraction after the projected analysis cuts .",
    "figure  [ fig : plot3 ] shows a sensitivity plot for measuring 2@xmath3dec using the lz detector , assuming a background rate of 1.8@xmath110@xmath41/(kgkevday ) at the region of interest .",
    "we have derived the first upper limit of the two neutrino double - electron capture process for @xmath0xe to the ground state of @xmath0te using published xenon100 experimental data .",
    "the obtained upper limit of 1.66@xmath110@xmath2 years was compared to the predicted half - life of 2.9@xmath110@xmath2 years , which can be measurable from the xenon100 experiment in three more years . utilizing the published lux background model",
    ", we predicted approximately 115 events per year in the lux detector , assuming a half - life of 2.9@xmath110@xmath2 years .",
    "these 115 events are measurable with the lux background model . by comparing our predicted events from the lux detector to the more sensitive and larger lz detector",
    ", we should be able to confidently measure this process .",
