    "near - infrared , long baseline interferometry is sensitive to the distribution of dust around the nearest young stars on scales of the order of 1 au , and provides a powerful probe of models of disks and envelopes of such stars .",
    "the herbig ae - be stars are pre - main sequence , emission line objects that are the intermediate mass ( @xmath3 ) counterparts of t tauri stars ( hillenbrand _ et al . _  1992 ) .",
    "we also observed the fu orionis object v1057 cyg , expected to have a strong disk signature due to the high accretion rate of such objects .",
    "while the evolutionary status of the fu orionis objects remains unclear , they are believed to be t tauri stars undergoing an episode of greatly increased disk accretion , involving a brightening of @xmath4 magnitudes .",
    "v1057 cyg , whose outburst began in 1969 - 70 , is the only fu orionis object for which a pre - outburst spectrum is available , confirming its pre - main sequence nature ( grasdalen 1973 ) . until now ,",
    "only one fu orionis object , fu orionis itself , has been resolved by long baseline optical interferometry ( malbet _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , and v1057 cyg was chosen for study as the next - brightest such object accessible to pti .",
    "we selected a sample of 5 sources from the thesis of millan - gabet , chosen to satisfy the observing limitations of pti , and to avoid known binaries ( with the exception of mwc 147 , whose companion is too faint to affect the current measurements ) .",
    "details of the instrument are described in colavita _",

    "the resulting calibrated visibilities @xmath16 are presented in table  ii .",
    "our reported visibilities are a wideband average produced synthetically from five narrowband channels . as a consistency check",
    ", sources were calibrated first relative to one calibrator , then relative to another , and the results compared to avoid problems with unknown binarity .",

    "table  ii also gives @xmath19 for the circumstellar contribution , where @xmath20 . because our program stars all have large infrared excesses , the corrections for stellar light are generally small .",
    "upper limits to the visibility squared were determined for sources lacking fringes , based upon the sensitivity of the detection algorithm and measuring the system visibility with a nearby calibrator .",

    "for our observations with the largest range of hour angles and projected baseline orientation , v1057 cygni is consistent with a circularly symmetric source .",
    "as an fu ori type object , there is little doubt that its infrared excess comes from a circumstellar disk and not a spherical distribution of dust .",
    "more modeling is necessary to put limits on the possible orientation of the disk .",
    "our measurements of mwc 147 in the ns baseline are consistent with those of akeson et al .  2000 .",
    "however , the new measurement in the nw baseline is inconsisitent with that of the ns baseline if the source is indeed a circularly - symmetric distribution on the sky .",
    "because the baselines have differring orientations , the difference can be accounted for by an asymmetric source distribution , such as a tilted disk .",
    "we wish to confirm the new nw measurement and perform further modeling of this source .",
    "we have resolved three young stellar objects at milli - arc second scales , two for the first time ( the herbig be star v594 cas , and the fu orionis star v1057 cyg ) . presumably we are sampling the distribution of warm dust close to the stars",
    ". however , these data alone are insufficient to fully constrain the sources , and other explanations besides circumstellar disks ( e.g. a binary companion ) are possible .",
    "no significant variation of the visibility is seen as a function of hour angle on the sky , suggesting a symmetric distribution on the sky .",
    "however , for mwc 147 , the measurements in two different baselines suggest an asymmetric distribution , such as a tilted disk .",
    "this is consistent with recent measurements by eisner _",
    "et al . _  ( 2003 ) for a similar sample of herbig stars , three of which appear to have disks with significant inclinations .",
