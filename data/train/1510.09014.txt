    "the camassa  holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath0 which serves as a model for shallow water @xcite , has been studied intensively over the last twenty years , due to its rich mathematical structure .",
    "for example , it is bi - hamiltonian @xcite , completely integrable @xcite and has infinitely many conserved quantities , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "yet another property attracted considerable attention : even smooth initial data can lead to classical solutions , which only exist locally due to wave breaking , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "that means the spatial derivative @xmath1 of the solution @xmath2 becomes unbounded within finite time , while @xmath3 remains bounded .",
    "in addition , energy concentrates on sets of measure zero when wave breaking takes place . neglecting this concentration yields to a dissipation and hence to the so - called dissipative solutions @xcite .",
    "however , taking care of the energy , yields another class of solutions , the conservative ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also possible to take out only a fraction of the concentrated energy , giving rise to the recently introduced @xmath4-dissipative solutions @xcite .",
    "a very illustrating example for this phenomenon is given by the so - called peakon - antipeakon solutions , which enjoy wave breaking and therefore can be prolonged thereafter in various ways as presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "however , as already the study of the peakon - antipeakon solutions shows , there are only very few solutions of the ch equation , which can be computed explicitly . even in the case of travelling wave solutions ,",
    "which have been classified by j. lenells in @xcite , some of them are only given implicitely .",
    "having a close look at the construction of various types of solutions @xcite , reveals that they are based on a reformulation of the ch equation as a system of ordinary differential equations in a suitable banach space by a generalized method of characteristics . thus computing solutions explicitly ,",
    "would involve a change of variables from eulerian to lagrangian coordinates , solving the equation in lagrangian coordinates and finally changing back from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates , as outlined in section  [ background ] . a task which in many cases seems to be impossible .",
    "thus most results concerning the prediction of wave breaking are obtained by following solutions along characteristics , see @xcite .",
    "however , a good understanding of solutions along characteristics allows the prediction of wave breaking in the nearby future , and in the case of conservative solutions , which one can follow both forward and backward in time , also to find out if wave breaking occurred recently , @xcite .",
    "based on this knowledge it is possible to construct some initial data @xmath5 , which has @xmath6 as an accumulation point of breaking times in the conservative case , as we will see in section  [ sec : ex ] .",
    "we will prove the following result .",
    "[ thm : accu ] let @xmath7 and @xmath8,\\\\ k_jx+d_j , & \\quad \\text { for } x\\in[x_j , x_{j+1 } ] , j\\in\\mathbb{n}\\\\   0 , & \\quad \\text { otherwise } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where the endpoints of the intervals @xmath9 $ ] are inductively defined through @xmath10 and the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfy @xmath13 furthermore , denote by @xmath14 the conservative solution of the ch equation with initial data @xmath15 , then @xmath6 is an accumulation point of breaking times .    in section  [ sec : cusp ]",
    "we are going to have a closer look at the cuspons with exponential decay @xcite , a class of travelling wave solutions with non - vanishing asymptotics , for which wave breaking takes place at any time .",
    "however , for any fixed time @xmath16 , the radon measure is purely absolutely continuous , which means that no energy is concentrated on sets of measure zero .",
    "this means in particular , that the set of points where wave breaking occurs at time @xmath16 , consists of a single point both in eulerian and lagrangian coordinates , as we will see .",
    "additional we are going to show that the breaking point is not traveling along one characteristic with respect to time , but is metaphorically speaking , jumping from one characteristic to the next one .",
    "these observations are very interesting since usually wave breaking is linked to the concentration of energy on sets of measure zero in eulerian coordinates , which corresponds to wave breaking taking place on sets of positive measure in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "thus it is natural that manipulating the concentrated energy gives rise to different solution concepts .",
    "for this example however the question turns up of how the dissipative solution looks like ?",
    "does it coincide with the conservative one or not ?    finally ,",
    "section  [ observation ] concludes this note , by an observation concerning the concentration of energy in the case of accumulating breaking times .",
    "the aim of this section is to outline the construction of conservative solutions of the ch equation , which consists of two main parts . on the one hand",
    "the interplay of eulerian and lagrangian coordinates and on the other hand the reformulation of the ch equation in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to presenting those results , which are going to play a key role in what follows .",
    "for details we refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us start with the interplay between eulerian and lagrangian coordinates .",
    "it is well - known that solutions of the ch equation might enjoy wave breaking within finite time .",
    "this means that the solution itself remains bounded while its spatial derivative becomes unbounded from below pointwise .",
    "in particular , energy concentrates on sets of measure zero at breaking time , which can be described with the help of positive , finite radon measures .",
    "thus , the admissible set of eulerian coordinates , @xmath17 , is defined as follows .",
    "[ eulerian coordinates][def : d ] the set @xmath17 is composed of all pairs @xmath18 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a positive , finite radon measure whose absolutely continuous part , @xmath21 , satisfies @xmath22    rewriting the ch equation in the weak formulation yields @xmath23 where @xmath24 a close inspection of reveals that one can try to compute solutions of the ch equation using the method of characteristics . indeed , this is possible but only under the assumption that @xmath20 is a purely absolutely continuous radon measure and that we are given some initial characteristic @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , due to wave breaking we can only expect to obtain local solutions so far .",
    "thus @xmath26 is the solution to @xmath27 for some given initial data @xmath25 , and additional we introduce the function @xmath28 whose time evolution is given through .    in the general case where @xmath20 is a positive finite radon measure , we use the following mapping from eulerian coordinates @xmath17 to lagrangian coordinates @xmath29 to obtain an admissible initial characteristic @xmath30 for any initial data @xmath31 .

    "however there are a lot of properties these functions have to satisfy to enable us to construct global ( conservative ) solutions to the ch equation .",

    ", we would like to emphasize that there are several ways to prolong solutions past wave breaking .",
    "most of them are related to how the energy is manipulated at breaking time . in the case of conservative solutions",
