    "@xcite showed that g0.253 + 0.016 is a dense turbulent cloud in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) .",
    "however , so far it has been unclear what drives this turbulence and whether that turbulence plays a role in controlling the low star formation rate ( sfr ) seen in g0.253 + 0.016 and in the cmz as a whole @xcite . using high - resolution alma @xmath0 mm dust and hnco molecular line data , we determine the driving mode of the turbulence in g0.253 + 0.016 and link the turbulence driving to the sfr .        the turbulence - regulated paradigm of star formation @xcite provides us with the basic framework for our approach to determine the turbulence parameters of g0.253 + 0.016 and allows us to make predictions for the star formation activity in g0.253 + 0.016",
    ". figure  [ fig : turbsf ] shows a sketch of the turbulence - regulated picture of star formation . in this model , turbulence shapes the density distribution of the clouds , thereby controlling the dense - gas fraction and thus , the formation of stars .",
    "then , stellar feedback ( such as supernova explosions or stellar winds ) and/or large - scale dynamics ( such as galactic shear or magneto - rotational instability ) drive the turbulence . understanding and determining the drivers of the turbulence is of fundamental importance in this model of star formation .    idealised numerical simulations",
    "have shown that compressible , supersonic turbulence decays quickly , in about a crossing time @xcite . given that g0.253 + 0.016 and other galactic clouds are in a dynamic state of supersonic turbulence means that the turbulence is driven by some physical stirring mechanism(s ) .",
    "turbulence driving mechanisms can be broadly separated into two groups : 1 ) stellar feedback , and 2 ) gas dynamics caused by mechanisms other than feedback .",
    "stellar feedback includes supernova explosions , stellar winds , and ionisation fronts @xcite , primarily caused by high - mass stars , as well as jets and outflows from young stars , including low- and intermediate - mass stars @xcite . the 2nd category ( which we refer to as `` dynamics '' in figure  [ fig : turbsf ] ) includes accretion ( such as accretion onto a galaxy ) and gravitational collapse @xcite , the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite , spiral - arm compression @xcite , cloud - cloud collisions @xcite , and shear . while different drivers can play a role in different environments , @xcite found that most of these drivers are not sufficient to explain the turbulent velocity dispersion in the cmz , but some of them can .",
    "a critical consideration is that the majority of turbulence drivers ( e.g. , supernova explosions , high - mass stellar winds , and accretion ) primarily drive compressible ( curl - free ) modes , so we refer to these as `` compressive drivers '' .",
    "by contrast , solenoidal ( divergence - free ) modes can be generated directly by shear and the mri ( so we call them `` solenoidal drivers '' ) .",
    "the key aspect here is that the density probability distribution function ( pdf ) depends critically on the driving .",
    "@xcite showed that the variance ( width ) of the density pdf is given by @xmath8 with the turbulent mach number @xmath9 ( the ratio of velocity dispersion and sound speed ) , plasma @xmath10 ( the ratio of thermal and magnetic pressure ) , and the turbulence driving parameter @xmath5 , which smoothly varies from @xmath11 for purely solenoidal driving to @xmath12 for purely compressive driving @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models and simulations in @xcite demonstrated that the sfr depends on @xmath5 , with compressive driving producing up to an order of magnitude higher sfrs than solenoidal driving .",
    "thus , our goal is to determine whether the driving of turbulence in g0.253 + 0.016 is primarily solenoidal or compressive .",
    "we do this by measuring @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath10 , and inverting equation  ( [ eq : sigrho ] ) to solve for @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we use our measurement of @xmath5 to predict the sfr in g0.253 + 0.016 and to contrast this to the sfr in milky way clouds located in the galactic disc rather than the galactic centre .",
    "the main results and methods of this work are published in @xcite . here",
    "we summarise the main results concerning the driving mode of the turbulence in g0.253 + 0.016 and its implications for the sfr .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows the h@xmath15 column density and the hnco intensity - weighted velocity in g0.253 + 0.016 . in order to isolate primarily turbulent motions in the cloud ,",
    "we have subtracted the large - scale velocity gradient seen across g0.253 + 0.016 @xcite . from the two maps in figure  [ fig : images ] ,",
    "we compute the column density pdf and the turbulent velocity pdf shown in figure  [ fig : pdfs ] , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath16 ( as reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the log - normalised column density contrast @xmath17 and the 1d velocity dispersion @xmath18 , both in the plane of the sky .",
    "using temperature measurements from @xcite , we find sound speeds @xmath19 , leading to the 3d turbulent mach number , @xmath2 in g0.253 + 0.016 .    in order to apply equation  ( [ eq : sigrho ] ) to solve for the turbulence driving parameter @xmath5",
    ", we need to convert the column - density variance @xmath20 to the volume - density variance @xmath13 .",
    "we use the technique developed in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and find @xmath1 . finally , we need an estimate for the turbulent ( unordered ) magnetic - field plasma @xmath10 parameter .",
    "we use the ordered magnetic field measurement from @xcite ( see polarisation pseudo vectors in figure  [ fig : images ] ) and run magneto - hydrodynamical turbulence simulations with this ordered field and the measured @xmath14 . from the simulations , we determine the unordered , turbulent plasma @xmath3 entering equation  ( [ eq : sigrho ] ) .    combining our measurements of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath10 and propagating the uncertainties , we find @xmath4 in g0.253 + 0.016 , indicating solenoidal driving of the turbulence .",
    "we interpret this driving to be the result of strong shearing motions in the cmz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kruijssen et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the driving parameter inferred for typical clouds in the galactic disc and spiral arms of the milky way .",
    "currently available measurements for taurus @xcite , grsmc43.30 - 0.33 @xcite and ic5146 @xcite all show @xmath6 with typical values of @xmath21 , thus exhibiting a significant compressive driving component , in contrast to the cmz cloud g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "using our measurements of @xmath5 , @xmath14 , and @xmath10 , we find a predicted @xmath22 , based on the theoretical multi - freefall models of the sfr summarised in @xcite . if we used a turbulence driving parameter @xmath21 ( as measured for clouds in the galactic disc and spiral arms ) , we would find a 7 times higher sfr .",
    "this shows that the driving of the turbulence is a critical parameter for star formation and may significantly contribute to explaining the low sfrs in g0.253 + 0.016 and possibly in the entire cmz ."
