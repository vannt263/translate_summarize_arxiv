    "energy transfer collisions between h@xmath1 and hd molecules , where h is hydrogen and d is deuterium , is of fundamental importance for the astrochemistry of the early universe and the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "hd represents the second most abundant primordial molecule after h@xmath1 and plays a significant role in the cooling of the primordial gas .",
    "the abundance of deuterium is low relative to hydrogen ( d / h@xmath3 ) , however the hd / h@xmath1 ratio can be enhanced by an approximate factor of @xmath4 due to chemical fractionation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , that in the framework of the standard cosmological model the radiation temperature is higher than the matter temperature and molecules become a heating source for the gas . at higher temperatures h@xmath1 molecules",
    "dominate the heating , however hd molecules dominate the kinetic process at lower temperatures .",
    "in addition , the hd molecule is especially important due to its permanent dipole moment and lower rotational constant , which makes the molecule to be an efficient coolant at low temperatures : @xmath5k @xcite . when h@xmath1 molecules are inefficient hd become important in cooling the primordial gas and the interstellar medium .",
    "this ability of hd makes these molecules to be very attractive .",
    "therefore knowledge of the ro - vibrational excitation and de - excitation thermal rate constants in the molecular h@xmath1+hd low energy collisions is of fundamental importance in understanding and modeling the energy balance within primordial gas .",
    "however , to accurately model the thermal balance and kinetics of such systems one needs accurate state - to - state cross - sections and rate constants @xmath6 .",
    "experimental measurement of quantum state resolved cross sections and rate coefficients is a very difficult technical problem . on the other hand ,",
    "accurate theoretical data require precise potential energy surfaces and reliable dynamical treatment of the collision processes .",
    "the first attempt to construct a realistic full - dimensional ab initio pes for the h@xmath1-h@xmath1 system was done in works @xcite , and the potential was widely used in a variety of methods and computation techniques .",
    "currently the deuterium chemistry of the eraly universe has been extensively studied by many researchers . here",
    "we would like to mention works @xcite and @xcite , where the authors carried out quantum - mechanical state - resolved calculations for low and very low temperatures down to 10 k @xcite , however using of the old and modifyed h@xmath1-h@xmath1 surface @xcite .",
    "nontheless the importance of the h@xmath1+hd in the astrophysical problems makes it vital to carry out new calculations for the system with recently published pes @xcite .",
    "this is done here in . moreover , with the current calculations we extend our recent experience for h@xmath1+h@xmath1 at low and very low kinetic energies @xcite .    as was mentioned above a new extensive study of the hydrogen - hydrogen surface",
    "has been recently reported by boothroyd et al .",
    "@xcite , where the potential energies have been represented at 48180 geometries respectively with a large basis set at the multireference configuration interaction level . in this work we provide the first calculations describing collisions of rotationally excited h@xmath1 and hd molecules using the bmkp pes    @xmath7    the scattering cross sections are calculated using a non reactive quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach . in the next section",
    "we will briefly outline the method and present results for the cross sections for rotational de - excitation of hd in low energy collisions with @xmath0-h@xmath1 .",
    "we compare our results with some previous investigations .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 3 .",
    "in this section we provide a brief outline of the quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach used in our calculations . the basis for this methodology",
    "was developed in work @xcite .",
    "the hd and h@xmath1 molecules are treated as linear rigid rotors . for the considered range of kinetic energies of astrophysical interest and for practical astrophysical estimations",
    "the rotor model is considered to be adequate for @xmath0-h@xmath1+hd collisions @xcite .",
    "the 4-atomic h@xmath1-hd system is shown in fig .",
    "it can be described by six independent variables : @xmath8 and @xmath9 are interatomic distances in each hydrogen molecule , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are polar angles , @xmath12 is torsional angle and @xmath13 is intermolecule distance .",
    "let us introduce @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the first one is a reduced mass of the pair of two - atomic molecules @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the second ones are reduced masses in hydrogen molecules . as we mentioned , the hydrogen molecules are treated as linear rigid rotors , that is distances @xmath18  a.u . in h@xmath1 and @xmath19  a.u . in hd",
    "are fixed in this model .",
    "we provide a numerical solution for the schrdinger equation for a @xmath20 collision in the center of the mass frame .",
    "the cross sections for rotational excitation and relaxation phenomena can be obtained directly from the @xmath21-matrix . in particular , the cross sections for excitation from @xmath22 summed over the final @xmath23 and averaged over the initial @xmath24 corresponding projections of the h@xmath1 molecules angular momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 the kinetic energy is @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 is the total energy in the system , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the rotation constants of the colliding hd and h@xmath1 molecules respectively , @xmath32 is total angular momenta of the 4-atomic system , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the channel wavenumber and @xmath37 are rotational channel energies .",
    "we apply the hybrid modified log - derivative - airy propagator in the general purpose scattering program molscat @xcite to solve a set of coupled second order differential equations for the unknown radial functions @xmath38 @xmath39 we have tested other propagator schemes included in the molscat code .",
    "it was found , that other propagators can also produce quite stable results .",
    "the log - derivative matrix is propagated to large @xmath40-intermolecular distances , since all experimentally observable quantum information about the collision is contained in the asymptotic behaviour of functions @xmath41 .",
    "the numerical results are matched to the known asymptotic solution to derive the physical scattering @xmath21-matrix @xmath42 where @xmath36 is the channel wavenumber , @xmath37 are rotational channel energies and @xmath29 is the total energy in the @xmath43 system .",
    "the method was used for each partial wave until a converged cross section was obtained .",
    "it was verified that the results are converged with respect to the number of partial waves as well as the matching radius , @xmath44 , for all channels included in our calculations .",
    "the new bmkp pes @xcite , which is used in these calculations , is a global six - dimensional potential energy surface for two hydrogen molecules .",
    "it was especially constructed to represent the whole interaction region of the chemical reaction dynamics of the four - atomic system and to provide an accurate as possible van der waals well . in the six - dimensional conformation space of the four atomic system",
    "the conical intersection forms a complicated three - dimensional hypersurface .",
    "because the bmkp pes @xcite uses cartesian coordinates to compute the distances between four atoms , we needed to devise a fortran program , which converts spherical coordinates used in the close coupling method @xcite to the corresponding cartesian coordinates and computes the distances between the four atoms followed by calculations of interatomic interaction forces .",
    "the four atomic system is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "let us introduce the jacobi coordinates @xmath45 and the radius - vectors of all four atoms in the space - fixed coordinate system @xmath46 : @xmath47 .",
    "we apply the following procedure : @xmath48 is directed along @xmath49 axis , the center of mass of the hd molecule is brought into coincidence with the center of @xmath46 , and the top of the @xmath48 is directed to center of mass of h@xmath1 , as shown in fig .  1 . now it is apparent , that @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "next , without the loss of generality , we can adopt the @xmath46 system in such a way , that the hd interatomic vector @xmath56 lies on the @xmath57 plane .",
    "then the angle variables of @xmath56 and @xmath58 are : @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "now one can see , that the cartesian coordinates of the atoms of the hd molecule are : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and in turn for the h@xmath1 molecule we have : @xmath63 and @xmath64 , because @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "in such a manner the cartesian and the jacobi coordinates are represented together for the four - atomic system h@xmath1+hd .    before our production calculations we carried out a large number of test calculations to insure the convergence of the results with respect to all parameters that enter into the propagation of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the same calculations were also done in our previous works @xcite for the @xmath68-/@xmath0-h@xmath1+h@xmath1 collisions , which involved the intermolecular distance @xmath40 , the total angular momentum @xmath32 of the four atomic system , the number of rotational levels to be included in the close coupling expansion @xmath69 , and others ( see the molscat manual @xcite ) .",
    "we reached convergence for the integral cross sections , @xmath70 , in all considered collisions .",
    "for example , for @xmath40 we used from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , we also applied a few different propagators included in the molscat program .",
    "we obtained convergent results in all cases .",
    "below we present our calculations for the state - resolved cross sections @xmath73 in the collision ( 1 ) .",
    "2 shows our data for the @xmath74 and @xmath75 quantum transitions together with the results of schaefer s work @xcite , which applied a modified version of schwenke s potential @xcite and different dynamical quantum - mechanical approach . as can be seen for these transition",
    "states the agreement between the two different calculations is excellent .",
    "we reproduced sharp resonances in the low velocity region , which are very important in cooling of the astrophysical media .",
    "in addition to fig .  2",
    "we separately show the cross section for only @xmath74 transition states in fig .",
    "this graph can be directly compared with the corresponding cross section from the schaefer work @xcite , please refer to figure 6 of that paper @xcite .",
    "one can see , that even small peculiarities at around 250 m / s and 450 m / s of the cross section behaviour are reproduced in details .    in the fig .",
    "4 we present the energy dependence of the cross sections for the @xmath76 and @xmath77 quantum - mechanical transition states . for the last transition we obtain very good agreement with the corresponding results of work @xcite .",
    "however , in the upper graph of fig .",
    "4 one can see rather large differences in the low velocity region .",
    "our calculations revealed , that the disagreement ranges up to about 100 % .",
    "finally , significant differences are found in the cross sections from the higher values of the transition states .",
    "5 presents our results again together with schaefer s data from @xcite for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in this case",
    "the disagreement ranges up to one order of magnitude .",
    "also , as can be seen from the graphs we calculated few new resonances for each of these transitions at a velocity of about 1200 m / s .",
    "the biggest value of these resonances is in the cross section @xmath78 .",
    "we show this separately in more detail in fig .",
    "the value of the resonance is relatively large and it also might be applicable in important astrophysical processes , such as collisional cooling",
    ".    through this analysis we can now conclude , that the new global bmkp pes can reproduce general behaviour of all considered cross sections in the @xmath0-h@xmath1+hd collision . for the lower quantum states we obtained sufficient agreement with previous calculations .",
    "however , for transition states from higher values , for example , @xmath81 the bmkp pes provides rather low cross sections relatively to the corresponding results of work @xcite .",
    "in this letter the state - to - state close - coupling quantum - mechanical calculations for rotational excitation and deexcitation cross sections of the @xmath0-h@xmath1+hd collision are presented .",
    "the linear rigid rotor model for the h@xmath1 and hd molecules is applied .",
    "the global and newest bmkp surface for the h@xmath1-h@xmath1 system has been appropriately adopted for the current @xmath0-h@xmath1+hd collisions .",
    "a test of convergence and the results for cross sections with the bmkp pes are obtained for a wide range of kinetic velocities including very low values down to 10 m / s .    our results revealed , that for low quantum transition states the bmkp surface provides cross sections very close to those obtained in previous works @xcite , where the authors adopted schwenke s old h@xmath1-h@xmath1 pes @xcite .",
    "however , for some higher quantum states we found significant disagreements with previous results @xcite ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "additionally , in our calculations some new resonances are found in the 1300@xmath82 m / s region for transition states from @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "it was found , that for the specific transition @xmath85 , @xmath86 the value of the resonance is relatively large in the cross section , and it may even stronger influence , for example , the cooling processes in primodial gas and interstellar media .",
    "further detailed calculations for higher quantum transition state cross sections and corresponding thermal rate constants @xmath87 for @xmath68-/@xmath0-h@xmath1+hd collisions at low and very low kinetic energies are in progress in our group .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to point out here , that the ultralow energy sector @xmath88k ) is of crucial importance now in connection with the recently achieved molecular bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should also be interesting and useful to apply the current time - independent , quantum - mechanical approach to investigate isotope effects in molecular hydrogen collisions at such ultralow energies .",
    "further , the methodology could be used to carry out new calculations for the important ultralow collisions considered in the works @xcite , as well as check the conclusions of the recent work @xcite involving scattering properties of weakly bound dimers of fermionic atoms .",
