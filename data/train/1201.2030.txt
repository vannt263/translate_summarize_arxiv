    "<S> excitation spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains with bond alternation ( explicit dimerization ) are studied using a combination of analytical and numerical methods . </S>",

    "<S> this can be understood as an effect of marginal perturbation to the sine - gordon theory . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , at the critical frustration separating the second - order and first - order dimerization transitions , the marginal operator vanishes and @xmath6 holds . </S>",

    "<S> our formula agrees well with the numerical results , confirming the theoretical picture . </S>",
    "<S> the present theory also implies that , even in the presence of a marginally irrelevant operator , the mass ratio approaches @xmath5 in the very vicinity of the second - order dimerization critical point @xmath7 . </S>",
