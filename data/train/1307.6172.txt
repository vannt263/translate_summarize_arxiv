    "it is now more than a decade since the first observations of type ia supernovae suggesting that the universe is currently experiencing a phase of accelerated expansion were done @xcite . since then , improved measurement of supernovae distance @xcite and additional evidence based , for instance , on the measurement of the cosmic microwave background @xcite or on the apparent size of the baryons acoustic oscillations @xcite have led to the same conclusion .",
    "the @xmath9cdm model is currently considered to be the most successful cosmological model by reason of its simplicity and of the quality of the fit to the data that it provides . in this model , the universe is composed of , in addition to ordinary matter ( radiation , baryon ) , a pressureless cold dark matter fluid and a cosmological constant @xmath9 , the simplest form of dark energy .    however , despite the excellent agreement with the observational data , the @xmath9cdm model is facing two theoretical difficulties , namely the _ cosmological constant problem _ @xcite and the _ coincidence problem _ @xcite .",
    "regarding the first one , there is a discrepancy of @xmath10123 orders of magnitude between the value of the energy density expected from theoretic computation and the value inferred from observations ( @xmath11 ) . as for the second one , according to the observations , the current values of the energy densities of matter and of dark energy are of the same order of magnitude ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is not strictly incompatible with the model , but however , requires a fine tuning of the initial conditions of the model .",
    "a possible way to avoid these problems would be to replace the cosmological constant @xmath9 by a cosmological term , @xmath13 , which is allowed to vary in time ( see for instance @xcite for some recent examples and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "hence , it would be possible for the dark energy density to decrease from an initial large value , consistent with the theoric expectation , to a smaller one , consistent with the current value inferred from the observations . in @xcite , we proposed a phenomenological model , referred to the @xmath13cdm model , where the dark fluids are interacting together in a flat spacetime with an energy transfer rate of the form @xmath14 .",
    "we mainly focused on the case where @xmath3 since , as we showed , it is the only one for which the ratio of matter to dark energy densities remains constant at late times ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this could have provided an explanation for the coincidence problem since the current value of @xmath16 could thus become typical of late times ; however it turned out that the region of the parameter space where the coincidence and the cosmological constant problems are solved ( or at least significantly alleviated ) are excluded by the observational constraints .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the analysis of @xcite for a flat spacetime to one with spatial curvature .",
    "moreover , in our previous work , we had set the value of the energy density of radiation to that obtained in the context of the @xmath9cdm model in order to reduce the number of parameters to constrain . here",
    ", we will consider this quantity as a free parameter .",
    "in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime , if the universe content is modeled by perfect fluids , its continuity equation is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the scale factor ) stands for the hubble term , @xmath20 is the sum of the energy density of each fluid ( @xmath21 ) and similarly , @xmath22 is the sum of the pressure of each fluid ( @xmath23 ) . defining @xmath24",
    ", we obtain a continuity equation for each fluid , subject to the the condition @xmath25 .",
    "these equations can be more conveniently written as @xmath26 where the value of the equation of state ( eos ) parameter ( @xmath27 ) depends on the nature of the fluid ( @xmath28 for cold matter ( dark and baryonic ) , @xmath29 for radiation and @xmath30 for dark energy ) . as we can see from the previous equation",
    ", the variation of the energy density could be the result of two different mechanisms .",
    "the first term on the rhs represents the usual energy density dilution caused by the cosmic expansion . as for the other term , since @xmath25 , it must be interpreted as a possible energy transfer between the fluids .",
    "a positive value ( @xmath31 ) constitutes a gain of energy for the fluid ( source term ) , and negative value ( @xmath32 ) , a loss of energy ( sink term ) . in the @xmath9cdm model ,",
    "the energy of each fluid is conserved separately , i.e. @xmath33 for all of them .",
    "in addition to ( [ eq : cont ] ) , to completely specify the time evolution we also need the friedmann equation , which takes its usual form @xmath34    now it remains only to specify the interaction terms @xmath35 for the @xmath13cdm model .",
    "following our previous work @xcite , we will chose the interaction term between dark energy and dark matter ( @xmath36 ) to be @xmath37 , where @xmath4 is a parameter to constrain . in order to find an explanation to the coincidence problem",
    ", we will try to find under which conditions , if any , it is possible to obtain a phase during which the ratio of the dark matter to the dark energy densities ( @xmath38 ) remains constant ( @xmath39 ) . to simplify our analysis , we will first consider the case of an era dominated by dark energy and matter ( @xmath9m - dominated era , @xmath40 ) , and subsequently , that of an era dominated by dark energy , matter and curvature ( @xmath9mk - dominated era , @xmath41 ) .      in @xcite",
    ", we have already shown that is impossible to have a constant ratio @xmath16 during @xmath9m - dominated era unless that @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , using the continuity equations for dark energy and matter ( [ eq : cont ] ) , we can show that @xmath42 if we suppose that at some point , @xmath16 reaches a constant value @xmath43 , hence @xmath39 at this point , and the parameter @xmath4 will be related to this value through @xmath44 since @xmath4 is a constant , the product @xmath45 must also be a constant . during a @xmath9m - era",

    "we will only consider the former case ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "inserting this expression into ( [ eq : qrdot0 ] ) , we see that the only consistent value for @xmath1 is @xmath48 , which leads to @xmath49 the negative value for the interaction term implies that the energy transfer must occur from dark energy to dark matter in order to reach a phase with a constant ratio @xmath43 in an expanding universe . if we invert this equation , we finally get an expression for @xmath43 @xmath50 which is shown in figure  [ fig : qq ] .    in @xcite , we have shown that , provided that @xmath51 , a flat universe will necessarily experience a late phase with @xmath39 . for a non - flat universe ,",
    "this result does not necessarily hold since the energy associated with the spatial curvature could possibly become non - negligible before that this phase has been reached .",
    "thus , we have to determine if @xmath52 decreases slower or faster than @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the @xmath9cdm model , to answer this question , we simply have to compare the eos parameter of the fluids ; a smaller value implies that the energy density will decrease slower . in the @xmath13cdm model , to take in account the effect of the energy transfer between the fluids , we need to look at the effective eos parameter , defined as @xmath55 .",
    "the continuity equation now takes the same form as in the @xmath9cdm model @xmath56 since @xmath57 , @xmath58 for the curvature . for dark energy and matter , in the case where @xmath16 is approaching @xmath43 , the effective eos parameters become @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the energy density @xmath52 will decrease faster than the two other ( @xmath60 ) if @xmath61 ( or equivalently , if @xmath62 ) . in this case",
    "the approximation of a @xmath9m - dominated era will remain accurate for ever .",
    "conversely , @xmath52 will decrease slower if @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "in this case , it would be possible to find solutions where @xmath16 approaches @xmath43 for a certain time , but eventually the assumption of a @xmath9m - dominated era will become invalid . we then need to look what happen during a @xmath9mk - dominated era .      during a @xmath9mk - dominated era ,",
    "the hubble term may be written as @xmath66^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\rho_{\\rm \\lambda}^{\\frac{1}{2}}.       \\label{eq : hlmk}\\ ] ] as in the previous section , we will consider only the case of an expanding universe ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "moreover , the product @xmath45 must still be a constant in order to have @xmath39 ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : qrdot0 ] ) ) .",
    "but now , this product involves the curvature to dark energy density ratio ( @xmath67 ) and is proportional to @xmath68 . for @xmath3",
    ", this quantity will be a constant only if , in addition to the ratio @xmath16 , the ratio @xmath69 is also a constant . in this case , it is useful to derive from ( [ eq : cont ] ) an equation for the time derivative of @xmath69 @xmath70 setting @xmath65 ( @xmath71 ) , we obtain an equation analogous to ( [ eq : qrdot0 ] ) @xmath72 these two expressions for the parameter @xmath4 must be equivalent and that will be the case only if @xmath73 , which leads to @xmath74 as in ( [ eq : qlm ] ) , the interaction term is negative . inverting this equation",
    ", we get @xmath75 this function is shown in figure  [ fig : qq ] . in this figure , one sees that for each value of @xmath4 , there are actually two solutions for which @xmath39 ( corresponding to @xmath43 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "hence , we have to find under which conditions one or the other solution ( if any ) will be relevant .",
    "first of all , we can notice that the two solutions are equivalent when @xmath77 ( which corresponds to @xmath78 ) . in this case",
    ", the interaction parameter is given by @xmath79 .",
    "it turns out that the cosmic evolution will be qualitatively different depending on whether the strength of interaction is weaker ( @xmath80 ) or stronger ( @xmath81 ) than this critical value .    in figure",
    "[ fig : attrak ] , two examples of trajectories in the plane @xmath82 are shown , one where the interaction is weaker than @xmath8 and the other where it is stronger . in each case , the plane is divided into two regions . in the figure ,",
    "the boundary between them is represented by a dashed line . for the region",
    "situated above this line , all the trajectories end at the same point . for the weak case , this point corresponds to the flat solution found in the previous section ( @xmath83 ) and for the strong case , to the non - flat solution found in the current section ( @xmath84 ) . in the region",
    "situated below the dashed line , the fate of the universe will be the same no matter the value of @xmath4 ; it will eventually reach a point on the line @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 ) and then recollapse . as for the trajectories starting exactly on the boundary between these two regions",
    ", they will also end in a point determined only by the value of @xmath4 , but conversely to the upper region , this point corresponds now to the non - flat solution for the weak case and to the flat solution for strong case .",
    "however , as we can see from the figure , these solutions are unstable since any small perturbation which takes the trajectory slightly away from the dashed line will make it diverge toward the stable solutions in the upper region or toward a recollapsing point in the lower region .",
    "for the strong case , the boundary between the two regions is set by the line @xmath87 , while for the weak case , the boundary is entirely situated below this line ( in this case we can not obtain an analytic expression to describe it ) .",
    "thus , an open universe ( @xmath88 ) will always evolve up to reach a stable point , while for a closed universe ( @xmath89 ) , that will be possible for a given initial point ( @xmath90 ) only if the interaction is sufficiently weak ( at least @xmath91 ) .",
    "here we have to keep in mind that in order to be able to explain the coincidence problem , it is not sufficient to find a solution for which the ratio @xmath16 becomes constant ; the current value of the ratio ( @xmath92 ) must also be close to this constant value .",
    "for the non - flat solution , this means that this value should be close to two ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this value is so different from that obtained for the @xmath9cdm model ( which already provides a good fit to data ) that it is reasonable to expect that this solution ( and the larger values of @xmath94 associated with it ) will be excluded by the observational constraints .",
    "if the larger values of @xmath94 are excluded , that will also affect the ability of the @xmath13cdm model to solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "indeed , if the interaction is too weak , that will not be possible for the dark energy density to decay from an initial large value to the small one observed today .",
    "actually , the condition @xmath73 for the non - flat solution results from the fact that , for @xmath3 , in order to have a constant value of @xmath16 , @xmath69 must also be a constant ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : qrdotk ] ) ) .",
    "it would then be interesting to verify whether it is possible to obtain a solution with @xmath39 and @xmath95 during a @xmath9mk - dominated era if we consider a different value of @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , we would like to check if it is possible to find a solution to @xmath96 for @xmath97 .      to derive ( [ eq : qrdot0 ] ) , which implicitly implies that @xmath39 , we have used the continuity equations of dark energy and of matter . during a @xmath9mk - dominated era , the description of the universe also involved the continuity equation of curvature and the friedmann equation .",
    "we can use these two equations to check whether there are other values than @xmath3 that are consistent with the condition @xmath39 . from the friedmann equation ( [ eq : hlmk ] ) , we get @xmath98 in order to have @xmath39 , the hubble term must be given ( [ eq : qrdot0 ] ) , i.e. @xmath99 hence , differentiating ( [ eq : rhok ] ) and replacing @xmath16 by @xmath43 yields @xmath100\\rho_{\\rm \\lambda}^{3n-3}-\\left[(1+\\tilde{r}_{\\rm m})q\\right]\\rho_{\\rm \\lambda}^n .",

    "the second one must be rejected , since , in addition to involve a violation of the weak energy condition ( @xmath106 ) either for @xmath53 or for @xmath54 , this solution has been obtained from a division by zero in ( [ eq : qrdot0 ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the only value leading to @xmath39 during a @xmath9mk - dominated era is @xmath3 . consequently , it is impossible to have simultaneously @xmath39 and @xmath95 .

    "this result contrasts with that found in @xcite where the best - fit point ( for a flat spacetime ) was situated in the positive values of @xmath119 . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the cosmological constant problem becomes actually worse , since the dark energy density is increasing with time and concerning the coincidence problem , as it is clearly shown from ( [ eq : qlm ] ) and ( [ eq : qlmk ] ) , the interaction parameter must be negative in order to possibly have a solution with a constant matter to dark energy density ratio at late times . in figure  [",
    "fig : g15 ] , we see that the presence of spatial curvature leads to an extension for the interval of confidence of each parameters relative to the flat case represented by the line @xmath127 . in the case of the matter energy density @xmath128 and the radiation energy density @xmath129 ,",
    "this extension is clearly larger in the positive direction , while for the interaction term @xmath119 , it is in the negative direction .",
    "this latter is important since it allows for a large and negative value of @xmath119 , which is more likely to solve the cosmological and the coincidence problems .    in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath119 ,",
    "the critical value @xmath8 , which set the limit between the two classes of solutions ( flat and non - flat ) becomes @xmath130 .",
    "the largest ( in terms of magnitude ) negative value which lies the 2-@xmath113 confidence region is @xmath131 ; thus only the flat solutions are relevant here .",
    "we can then obtain the late - time value of @xmath16 from the value of the interaction parameter by inverting ( [ eq : qlm ] ) , as we did in figure  [ fig : grm ] . in this figure , we have also shown the points , in the 1-@xmath113 and 2-@xmath113 confidence regions , which minimize the relative variation between the current and the late - time value of the matter to dark energy density ratio , @xmath132 .",
    "ideally , we would like to obtain @xmath133 in order to explain the coincidence problem ( thus the current value of @xmath16 would be typical for @xmath134 ) .",
    "however , we get @xmath135 in the 1-@xmath113 region and @xmath136 in the 2-@xmath113 region . since for the @xmath9cdm model , @xmath137",
    ", one can argue that the coincidence problem is alleviated in the @xmath13cdm model .",
    "however , an interesting way to visualize the coincidence problem is to plot the function @xmath138 as a function of the time ( figure  [ fig : evol ] ) . for the @xmath9cdm model ( at the best - fit point )",
    ", this function is characterized by an early and a late phase where @xmath139 which are separated by a median one where @xmath140 and forms a peak .",
    "the duration of this median phase is very narrow in comparison to the entire universe history and the coincidence problem consists in the fact that we are currently situated in it .",
    "if we look now at the plot for the point minimizing @xmath126 in 2-@xmath113 region in the @xmath13cdm model , we can see that the function @xmath141 is characterized , as before , by an early phase where @xmath139 and a median one where @xmath140 and forms a peak .",
    "however , for the late phase , @xmath140 and becomes approximately constant ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "since @xmath143 , the order of magnitude of the current value of @xmath16 is now typical for @xmath134 . in this sense the coincidence problem is alleviated .",
    "however , as was the case for the @xmath9cdm model , we are currently situated in the median phase , which remains narrow compared to the whole universe history . moreover , from the fluid evolution shown in figure  [ fig : evol ] , we can see that at @xmath125 , it is not only the energy densities of matter and of dark energy that are of the same order of magnitude , but also that of curvature , which is actually a triple coincidence problem . hence , we can conclude that for the parameters range which are consistent with the observations , the @xmath13cdm model fails to provide a completely satisfying explanation to the coincidence problem .     and the 2-@xmath113 confidence regions obtained from observational constraints in the plane @xmath144 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is obtained from ( [ eq : qlm ] ) and the parameter @xmath92 is the current value of the matter to dark energy density ratio ( @xmath145 ) .",

    "the negative values of @xmath43 which , inserted in ( [ eq : qlm ] ) , leads to a positive values of @xmath146 are not represented .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath43 can be used as a parameter to characterize the decay of dark matter to dark energy but do not represent the physical ratio @xmath147 since we suppose that the interaction stops when all the dark matter has decayed ( @xmath148 ) . ]    for both models , the discrepancy between the observed and the predicted values of the dark energy density remains roughly the same every everywhere in the 1 and the 2-@xmath113 confidence regions ( @xmath149 ) . for the @xmath13cdm model , to explain this result ,",
    "we have made the hypothesis that the dark energy density could decrease from an initial large value ( @xmath150 , evaluated at @xmath151 ) , to the current observed one ( @xmath152 ) . inside of the 1-@xmath113 confidence region , the largest value that we get for the ratio @xmath153 is @xmath154 , and inside of the 2-@xmath113 region , @xmath155 .",
    "these are very far from the ratio @xmath156 needed to solve the cosmological constant problem .",

    "however , the interacting model involves an additional parameter to constrain ( @xmath119 ) , hence it is not surprising that it provides a better fit to data . to take into account the different number of parameters , the significance of the improvement of the @xmath158 value may be assessed by the mean of the bayesian information criterion @xcite , defined as @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the maximum likelihood",

    "following @xcite , we will regard a difference of 2 for the bic as a non - significant , and of 6 or more as very non - significant improvement of the @xmath158 value . using the @xmath9cdm model as reference",
    ", we get @xmath165 .",
    "hence the addition of an extra parameter is not warranted by the marginal decrease in the value of @xmath158 . since the @xmath13cdm model is not able either to provide a satisfying explanation to the cosmological and to the coincidence problems we must conclude that the @xmath9cdm model remains the most satisfying one .",
    "despite of successes ( simplicity , good fit to data ) , the @xmath9cdm model is not completely satisfying because of the existence of the coincidence problem , and more importantly , of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "these two problems have been actively studied since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe , but none of the proposed solutions has been able to convince unanimously the cosmological community . in @xcite",
    "a cosmological model where dark energy and dark matter interacts through a term @xmath37 in flat spacetime was considered .",
    "it has been shown that for @xmath3 , this model could have provided an elegant solution to both problems , but the values of the parameters required were excluded by observational constraints .",
    "given the importance of the cosmological constant and the coincidence problem , we were motivated to complete the analysis of the model by checking whether this result holds also in the presence of spatial curvature .",
    "we have shown that even in that case , @xmath3 remains the only value for which it is possible to find a late - time cosmology with a constant ratio of dark matter to dark energy density .",
    "depending on the strength of the interaction , the universe will be nearly flat ( @xmath5 ) for @xmath80 or will admit spatial curvature ( @xmath166 ) for @xmath81 at late times .    by constraining the model using observational data , we have found that within the 2-@xmath113 confidence region , the cosmological constant problem remains as severe as in the @xmath9cdm model .",
    "for the coincidence problem , the situation is different .",
    "it is now possible to find points in the 2-@xmath113 confidence region for which the current value and the late - time value of the ratio of dark matter to dark energy density are of the same order of magnitude , @xmath167 .",
    "however , for these points , the current time @xmath125 is situated in the short time interval for which @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "hence , we can not conclude that , in presence of spatial curvature , the @xmath13cdm model provides a completely satisfying solution to the coincidence problem .",
    "we thank james cline for his comments on this manuscript .",
    "this work was partly supported by the fonds de recherche du qubec - nature et technologies ( fqrnt ) through the doctoral research scholarships programme .",
    "to constrain the model parameters , we have proceeded similarly to what we did in @xcite , i.e. that we have used observational tests involving the distance modulus @xmath170 of type ia supernova ( sneia ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the observational hubble rate ( ohd ) .",
    "these data are actually frequently used to constrain the cosmological models with interacting dark energy @xcite . in our current analysis , there are two noticeable differences in comparison to our previous study . for the ohd constraints ,",
    "we have used an updated dataset @xcite and for the cmb constraints , we have only used the acoustic scale @xmath171 since as it was pointed in @xcite , the cmb shift parameter @xmath172 is model dependent and can be used only in the case where the dark energy density is negligible at the decoupling epoch ( which a priori , we do not know ) .",
    "moreover , it is to be noticed that the planck results @xcite came out after that we have started our numerical analysis . with these results ,",
    "we could have used updated data for the cmb constraints ( @xmath173 and @xmath174 ) and for the bao constraints , a measurement of the ratio @xmath175 at a new redshift ( @xmath176 ) . for each of these dataset ,",
