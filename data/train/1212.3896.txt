    "the theory of critical phenomena and the emergent notion of universality was one of the singular developments of physics in the twentieth century . with a known order parameter and symmetries of the problem , calculation of long - range , measurable behaviors of equilibrium physical quantities",
    "becomes a rather straightforward task .",
    "the success has turned out to be hard to replicate for non - equilibrium systems and systems where symmetry properties are similar in the phases on both sides of the transition @xcite .",
    "here it is often unclear which quantity can serve as a good order parameter , and the developed theoretical machinery does not apply .",
    "where progress has been made , order parameters have been very specific , making it difficult to identify universal properties .",
    "for example , in reaction - diffusion problems with absorption , one commonly uses linear superposition of particle concentrations as order parameters @xcite , while particle current is a better choice for jamming problems @xcite .",
    "further , the order parameters often have nontrivial relations to easily observable quantities .",
    "for example , phase transitions in some systems with dynamic heterogeneities often must be described with four - point correlation functions of particle densities @xcite , or a multitude of correlation functions @xcite .",
    "similarly , dynamical phase transition require one to study the space of trajectories instead of the state space @xcite .    whatever the choice , the order parameter is a statistics averaged over a distribution of microscopic states .",
    "a continuous or discontinuous change in its value at a transition indicates a similar change in the underlying probability distribution .",
    "therefore , it is natural to shift attention to the distribution itself , and , specific to nonequilibrium systems , to how it converges to the steady state",
    ".    intuitively , different phases ( often with different symmetries ) manifest themselves by changes in our ability to use local experimental measurements for long - range predictions .",
    "for example , nonzero magnetization in an ising magnet allows us to predict with some certainty orientation of far away spins based on the value of the spin at the origin .",
    "similarly , different crystalline phases of solids have different density autocorrelation functions , and hence existence of an atom at the origin translates into different predictions about the presence of an atom a certain distance away . then instead of a specific statistics characterizing the predictability , namely the order parameter , it might be useful to study one s ability to use local measurements to predict states of the rest of the system _",
    "directly_.    this prediction ability is naturally quantified using the language of shannon s information theory @xcite . in previous work ,",
    "we have termed it the _ predictive information _",
    "briefly , in information theory , the total uncertainty in a system specified by a state @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is measured by the ( differential ) entropy , @xmath5=-\\int d^nx p(\\vec{x})\\log_2p(\\vec{x}).\\ ] ] then observing a state of another variable @xmath6 , @xmath7 , may reduce the uncertainty about @xmath8 , and hence provide the information about it @xmath9&=&s[x]-\\langle",

    "it tends to a handful of universal behaviors for large systems , @xmath19 , intuitively correlating with the complexity of the underlying physical process .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 indicates an easily predictable deterministic , or a short correlation length probabilistic dynamics ( `` simple '' long range prediction can be perfect , or it is impossible , respectively ) .",
    "further , @xmath21 is indicative of a second order equilibrium phase transition ( power - law decaying correlations allow for complex , multiscale , partially predictable patterns over very long distances ) .",
    "finally , @xmath22 , @xmath23 may correspond to more exotic phase transitions with infinite - dimensional order parameters , but this case is not well understood .",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 on the full underlying probability distribution and the relation to phase transitions make it natural to explore @xmath24 as a `` universal order parameter '' , also useable in the nonequlibrium context .",
    "however , we are not aware of calculations of predictive information for nonstationary processes , where @xmath25 is explicitly or implicitly time dependent . further , even for equilibrium systems , the transition between @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the vicinity of a phase transition has not been studied .    in this paper , we study predictive information in a context of a simple nonequilibrium , continuous - time markov process , which ages and develops an absorbing state at a certain critical value of a parameter . this process can be viewed as a toy model , which is likely to possess some features of more complex systems .",
    "we calculate the expression for predictive information at the critical point and , for the first time for any system , near the critical point .",
    "the calculation reveals the need to modify the definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : in ] ) , to remove an ultraviolet divergence emerging due to the continuous - time nature of the process .",
    "similar modifications will likely allow extension of predictive information methodology to multidimensional systems .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly the logarithmic divergence of @xmath24 at the transition , and we show that the divergent term in the information is insensitive to temporally local , invertible transformations of the state space .",
    "this makes predictive information , and specifically its divergent term , a great candidate to characterize nonequlibrium phase transitions .",
    "we consider a markovian system governed by the following langevin equation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "we will treat this equation in the ito sense . without the noise term",

    "that is , small @xmath36 ) , @xmath30 gets kicked out from @xmath37 region , and the system equilibrates . for small noise ( large @xmath36 ) , a near - deterministic relaxation to the absorbing state at @xmath35 persists .",
    "this is probably the simplest example of nonequilibrium , stochastic relaxation dynamics , and it is a natural starting point for the analysis .",

    "( [ eq : in ] ) , is trivial .",
    "however , the information can depend on @xmath14 since the system is not stationary , and not time - translation invariant . specifically , for small noise , each subsequent @xmath30 is more narrowly distributed .",
    "this allows the information to increase unboundedly with @xmath14 , unlike in typical finite - dimensional markov processes with constant transition probabilities , where @xmath48 is always finite @xcite .",
    "these considerations also point out that one must take the sequence on @xmath14 observations starting from exactly the same time when calculating the averages .    since @xmath49 is continuous , @xmath50 as @xmath42 .",
    "the state of the process at the next time step becomes exactly known , and predictive information diverges .",
    "however , this is a superficial ultraviolet divergence , while we are interested in studying the infrared behavior .",
    "interestingly , this interfacial effect has been the primary reason behind the inability to apply predictive information ideas to systems in more than one dimension , where the size of the interface diverges with the system size .",
    "this makes it difficult to disambiguate divergences in predictive information coming from long - range prediction from those produced by short range interfacial effects .",
    "we thus need to introduce the cutoff scale into the system , at which predictive information is computed , similarly to how one does this in the renormalization group theory . for this",
    ", we redefine predictive information as mutual information between the past of duration @xmath51 and the future of duration @xmath52 , separated by a `` scale '' gap of duration @xmath53 , which remains finite as @xmath54 .",

    "from eq .  ( [ eqn : geninfo ] ) , it is clear that predictive information is invariant under reparameterization of @xmath30 .",
    "this is a desired property for any potential universal order parameter .",
    "further , any experimental device measuring @xmath49 will act as a temporal filter , so that the measured values will be convolutions of true @xmath30 s at nearby time points .",
    "thus it is also desirable for the nonequilibrium order parameter to be invariant to temporally local invertible transformations of data @xcite .",
    "does the predictive information obey this property ?",
    "the filter , represented by @xmath57 , maps the sequences of true states of the system @xmath58 into measured data @xmath59 .",
    "we require that the filter does not inject additional information into the dynamics .",
    "this means that the extraneous parameters of the mapping @xmath60 must be known . in a real - life experiment",
    ", this means that we would like to be able to separate the behavior of the observed system from any artifacts associated with the experimental setup .    in general terms , such filter can be represented by a convolution kernel @xmath61 .",
    "since a convolution mixes the past and the future , the measured data @xmath59 is no longer markovian .",
    "we require that the so - introduced statistical dependences are short lived , i.  e. the kernel @xmath61 is of compact support or decreases with time exponentially or faster .",
    "this is our definition of temporal locality .",
    "convolutions are reductions in rank and therefore ( potentially ) invertible only for infinitely long data sequences .",
    "therefore , we can define invertibility only in the @xmath62 limit . to this end , let @xmath63 be the space of all temporally discretized , finite length trajectories , that is the space of all @xmath64-tuples of @xmath30 , @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 be a function such that @xmath67 .",
    "that is , a sequence of @xmath14 data points is defined from @xmath68 points through some filtering procedure .",
    "we consider this mapping to be invertible if the radon - nikodym derivative over the set @xmath69 converges to a delta function for @xmath19 .",
    "more specifically , the probability of observing a trajectory @xmath70 is given by @xmath71.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] thus invertibility requires that the hessian matrix of the exponent in this equation diverges , defining a dominant stationary solution of the corresponding `` action '' . with this requirement , @xmath72 are simply reparameterizations of @xmath73 , and predictive information is invariant under the change .",
    "while this requirement is very general , we suspect that , in practice , it will be equivalent to the asymptotic properties of trajectory - averaged quantities , for which there are already well established results @xcite .",
    "we leave exploration of these conditions to future work .",
    "to calculate predictive information in the model , we first calculate the green s functions ( the marginal and the conditional distributions ) of eq .",
