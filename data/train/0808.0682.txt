    "the asymmetry of the yields can be quantified by introducing the ratio of pseudorapidity densities at a given negative pseudorapidity relative to that at the positive pseudorapidity of the same magnitude .",
    "this backward / forward ratio ( forward being the original direction of motion of the light partner ) is referred to as pseudorapidity asymmetry . the star collaboration published pseudorapidity asymmetries in 200 @xmath5gev @xmath6 collisions for several identified hadron species and total charged hadrons in the pseudorapidity intervals @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite .",

    "the theoretical relevance of asymmetric collision systems ( in particular colliding the lightest nuclei like protons or deuterons on a heavy partner ) in testing parameterizations for nuclear shadowing and models for initial multiple scattering was recognized prior to the availability of 200 @xmath5gev rhic deuteron - gold data  @xcite .",
    "one can take advantage of the fact that positive ( forward ) rapidities correspond to large parton momentum fractions from the light partner and small momentum fractions from the heavy nucleus ( and vice versa for negative rapidities ) , and that there are more collisions suffered traversing the heavy partner .",

    "the transverse momentum distribution is taken to be a gaussian , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the two - dimensional width of the transverse - momentum distribution in the proton .",
    "based on the then - available pion and unidentified hadron production data , an estimate for the model width of the transverse - momentum distribution of partons in the proton ( @xmath41 ) was presented in ref .",

    "we observe that : ( a ) since the dependence is logarithmic , the energy step we make from rhic to lhc is comparable to the one from sps to rhic .",
    "we thus do not a priori expect a radical change in the trend .",

    "( c ) the present study , at lhc energies , is exploratory .",
    "results of pp collisions at the lhc will be helpful in determining the magnitude of the presently uncertain @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to appreciate the physical necessity of the presence of a transverse - momentum degree of freedom in proton - proton and , therefore , nuclear collisions .",
    "however , the handling of the effect of the nuclear environment on transverse momenta is one of the specific features of the given description .",
    "most shadowing parameterizations include at least some of the effects of multiple scattering in the nuclear medium , while the hijing parameterization ( as we discuss further in sec .",
    "[ shad_multiscatt ] ) needs to be augmented with modeling nuclear multiscattering . for this purpose , in @xmath1 collisions",
    "we use a broadening of the width of the transverse momentum distribution ( [ eq : kt ] ) according to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the width already present in proton - proton collisions , @xmath48 is the number of effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath49 ) collisions as a function of nucleon impact parameter @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the average increase in width per @xmath49 collision . in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath35 ) collisions , the @xmath4 distributions of both nuclei are subject to the broadening represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : broad ] ) .    the function @xmath48 can be written in terms of the number of collisions suffered by the incoming proton in the target nucleus , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross sections .",

    "we do not change the values of these parameters in the present study .",
    "the resulting transverse momentum broadening may appear too large relative to what is observed in drell - yan data at fnal .",
    "however , we focus on meson production in the present application , where the phenix experiment extracts intrinsic transverse momenta in @xmath3 collisions at rhic energies that are similar in magnitude to the ones discussed here@xcite",
    ". further details about this aspect of the model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath37 is treated phenomenologically in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present study .",
    "while next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations provide a more accurate description of the parton - level cross section , they continue to rely on the factorization theorem and represent the non - perturbative information in terms of pdfs and fragmentation functions .",
    "since these functions are fitted to the same data as in lo , the expected change is a shift in responsibilty between the perturbative and non - perturbative sectors in describing the data used to define the non - perturbative ingredients . in aplications to a larger set of data this will not eliminate the need for the phenomenological use of a transverse momentum distribution , in particular considering the fact that even nlo may be far from a full perturbative expansion .",
    "in addition , above we argue for inclusion of a transverse momentum degree of freedom on fundamental physical grounds as basic as the uncertatinty principle . the simple gaussian representation of this physics provides a phenomenologically useful additional parameter ( the width ) .",
    "this holds true both at the lo and nlo levels .",
    "going to nlo may change the range of transverse momenta where intrinsic @xmath37 is important ( see e.g. refs .",
    "no attempt is made in the present work to discuss the @xmath57 , flavor ( quarks and gluons ) , and rapidity dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "we have limited ourselves here to a simple effective description .",
    "this seems adequate for now , since @xmath37 effects are appreciable only at relatively low @xmath4 , and a major focus of this work is asymmetry at high @xmath4 ( except at very forward rapidities where @xmath4-s are low due to phase space constraints ) . the intrinsic transverse momentum , @xmath58 , enhances hadron production yields at low @xmath4 in both negative and positive pseudorapidity regions , thus tending to cancel out in the asymmetry ratio .",
    "multiscattering , on the other hand , does impact appreciably on the asymmetry even at low @xmath4 .",
    "overall , calculations within this framework have proven their value in the interpretation of hadron - production data  @xcite .",
    "( for a comparison of the leading - order @xmath37-factorized approach and next - to - leading order collinear approach see ref .",

    "the collinear npdfs @xmath59 are expressible as convolutions of nucleonic parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath39 and a shadowing function @xmath60 which encodes the nuclear modifications of parton distributions .",
    "we use the mrst2001 pdfs  @xcite for the nucleon parton distributions , and for the shadowing function we employ both the eps08 shadowing routine  @xcite and hijing  @xcite .",
    "( other npdfs , like fgs  @xcite , hkn  @xcite , and the earlier eks  @xcite , are used elsewhere to calculate pseudorapidity asymmetries  @xcite . ) for the final hadron fragmentation we utilize the fragmentation functions in the akk set  @xcite .",
    "the factorization scale is tied to the parton transverse momentum via @xmath61 , while the fragmentation scale varies with the transverse momentum of the outgoing hadron , according to @xmath62 , following the best - fit results obtained in ref .",
    "this scale fixing is not modified from earlier applications , and is used consistently throughout the present calculations . to protect against divergences in the partonic cross sections ,",
    "a cutoff regulator mass is necessary .",
    "we have tested the sensitivity of our calculations at different cms energies by varying the regulator mass between @xmath63 gev . for @xmath64",
    "gev / c our results show little sensitivity to variation of regulator mass .",
    "we present results for @xmath65 gev / c here , and thus regulator mass effects are expected to be minimal .",
    "we obtain the density distribution of the deuteron from the hulthen wave function  @xcite ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while a woods - saxon density distribution is used for gold and lead with parameters from ref .  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factor is designed to compare , as a ratio , spectra of particles produced in nuclear collisions to a hypothetical scenario in which the nuclear collision is assumed to be a superposition of the appropriate number of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the ratio can be defined as a function of @xmath4 for any produced hadron species @xmath15 at any pseudorapidity @xmath0 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the average number of binary collisions in the various impact - parameter bins .",
    "nuclear effects manifest themselves in @xmath68 values greater or smaller than unity , representing enhancement or suppression , respectively , relative to the @xmath49 reference .    in asymmetric collisions",
    ", hadron production at forward rapidities may be different from what is obtained at backward rapidities .",
    "it is thus of interest to study ratios of particle yields between a given pseudorapidity value and its negative in these collisions .",
    "the pseudorapidity asymmetry @xmath69 is defined for a hadron species @xmath15 as @xmath70    let us consider the ( double ) ratio of the forward and backward nuclear modification factors in @xmath6 collisions for species @xmath15 : @xmath71 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the @xmath3 rapidity distribution is symmetric around @xmath72 , if the same backward and forward ( pseudo)rapidity ranges are taken in both directions ( i.e. @xmath73 ) , then the @xmath3 yields cancel in eq .",
    "( [ y - r : eq ] ) and one obtains that the ratio defined in ( [ y - r : eq ] ) is identical to the pseudorapidity asymmetry ( [ yasym ] ) : @xmath74    eq . ( [ y - r2:eq ] ) is useful from the experimantal point of view to handle the systematic errors of data and extract the proper pseudorapidity asymmetry .",
    "it also provides a connection between measured rapidity asymmetry and the nuclear modification factors .",
    "we expect that particle production in @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) collisions will have different yields in the forward and backward directions .",
    "this is because the respective partons have different momentum fractions ( shadowing differences ) and because the forward - going parton has to traverse a large amount of matter .",
    "we found in our earlier studies that the hijing shadowing parameterization is particularly useful for the study of multiple scattering , as it requires an explicit treatment of @xmath37 broadening ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : broad ] ) ) for a successful description of data  @xcite . in this section",
    "we therefore study the interplay of shadowing and multiple scattering in more detail using the hijing parameterization .",

    "the solid line represents hijing shadowing with intrinsic @xmath37 in the proton , the dashed line is hijing with intrinsic @xmath37 and multiple scattering , while the dot - dashed curve is obtained by turning off any transverse momentum.,width=321,height=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiscatt ] we display the neutral pion yield as a function of pseudo - rapidity in @xmath6 collisions at a fixed @xmath4 , namely at @xmath75 gev / c .",
    "this illustrates how the nuclear effects we examine modify the asymmetry of the yields .",
    "the figure shows the calculated distribution using the hijing shadowing parameterization without any intrinsic @xmath37 ( dot - dashed curve ) , using hijing shadowing and including the intrinsic @xmath37 in the nucleon ( solid ) , and hijing shadowing with intrinsic @xmath37 and multiple scattering ( dashed ) .",
    "the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : broad ] ) are unchanged from our previous studies at midrapidity  @xcite , and we have chosen a transverse momentum value comparable to @xmath76 , where the various effects are clearly displayed .    we checked that when shadowing and all nuclear effects are turned off , the distribution is symmetric around midrapidity , as expected . with shadowing only",
    ", we find an asymmetry in the distribution : the yield at a fixed negative pseudorapidty , say @xmath77 ( @xmath78 side or `` backward '' ) is higher than at the corresponding positive pseudorapidity ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 side , or `` forward '' ) .",
    "thus the pseudorapidity asymmetry , @xmath81 , is greater than unity in this case .",
    "the inclusion of the intrinsic transverse momentum in the proton significantly increases the yields on both the @xmath78 side and the @xmath80 side at this transverse momentum , as it makes larger @xmath4-s accessible .",
    "we tested that adding intrinsic transverse momentum in the proton in the absence of shadowing does not destroy the forward / backward symmetry . when intrinsic @xmath37 in the proton is added to the calculation using shadowing , but without the multiple scattering contribution , the sense of the asymmetry given by shadowing ( backward / forward @xmath82 1 ) is preserved .",
    "however , when multiple scattering is included , the yield shows a stronger increase in the forward direction .",
    "this is understandable in the present picture , since forward - going products originate in the partons of the deuteron , and have to traverse a large amount of nuclear matter resulting in strong multiple scattering , while the backward products suffer no or little multiple scattering .",
    "this has the effect of reversing the asymmetry : the yield on the @xmath80-side is now greater than that on the @xmath78-side .",
    "the calculated pseudorapidity asymmetry , @xmath81 , turns out to be less than unity in this case .",
    "an alternative way to summarize the situation is to say that shadowing suppresses the yield more on the @xmath80 side ( forward ) relative to a symmetric collision , while the multiple scattering contribution is understandably large in the forward direction .",
    "we have carried out similar studies at higher @xmath4 values .",
    "when the intrinsic transverse momenta are small relative to the @xmath4 of the final hadron , @xmath37 effects become naturally smaller . shadowing",
    "effects also become smaller as the antishadowing region of the hijing parameterization is approached . thus , at @xmath83 gev / c the influence of multiple scattering and intrinsic @xmath37 become negligible .",
    "these phenomena are most important at intermediate @xmath4 values , 2 gev / c @xmath84 8 gev / c at rhic .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar transverse - momentum region is sensitive to nuclear effects at lower ( e.g. cern sps ) energies , due to the @xmath85 scaling of the cronin peak  @xcite .",
    "to judge the success of the model in reproducing spectra , here we first present calculated spectra for neutral pion production at midrapidity and non - zero rapidities .",
    "this will help select the model choices providing the best agreement with the experimental information .",
    "the selected model variants are then used to calculate pseudorapidity asymmetries .",

    "the solid line represents the eps08 npdfs , while the dashed line is obtained using hijing shadowing with the inclusion of multiscattering .",
    "the dot - dashed line corresponds to hijing without multiscattering , and filled triangles denote the star data  @xcite.,width=321,height=321 ]    the lower four panels are our predictions for the asymmetry as pseudorapidity increases .",
    "the first three of these correspond to the brahms pseudorapidity intervals  @xcite .",
    "the general trend is that the asymmetry becomes larger as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this mainly arises from the strong shadowing in the larger nucleus at lower @xmath57 values . also , since increasing @xmath0 leads to decreasing accessible @xmath4 due to phase space constraints , the effects of multiple scattering become more pronounced .",
    "in fact , for the largest @xmath0 considered , @xmath105 , there is a marked difference between hijing with and without multiple scattering for all @xmath4 considered .",
    "it is pertinent at this point to make some remarks about pseudorapidity asymmetry in the brahms pseudorapidity intervals .",
    "the brahms collaboration  @xcite has observed a progressive suppression of both minimum bias nuclear modification @xmath106 and central - to - peripheral ratios , @xmath107 , with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the present study is limited to minimum bias pseudorapidity asymmetry , and both shadowing parameterizations ( eps08 and hijing ) adequately describe the existing experimental data at very forward rapidities .",
    "the eps08 parameterization incorporates rhic data at large rapidities , i.e. at low @xmath57 , and thus reproduces the data .",
    "therefore , at least in the minimum bias case , shadowing seems sufficient for a good description of the suppression observed at low @xmath57 .",
    "the situation is different for the geometry - dependent @xmath107 , where ( @xmath50-independent ) shadowing plus conjectured impact parameter dependencies  @xcite are clearly inadequate in describing the observed suppression .",
    "let us now turn to our predictions for the pseudorapidity asymmetry in a potential future @xmath13 collision at lhc energy of @xmath14 @xmath5tev .",
    "the calculated results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : asylhc ] , where the upper panel is for the interval @xmath108 and the lower panel is for @xmath109 .",
    "these intervals correspond to acceptance in the central detector and in the muon arm , respectively , of the alice experiment  @xcite .",
    "all three sets predict minimal asymmetry of the order of a few percent for the interval @xmath108 .     for @xmath110 at @xmath111 @xmath5tev for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the solid line represents the eps08 npdfs , while the dashed line is obtained from hijing with the inclusion of multiscattering .",
    "the dot - dashed line corresponds to hijing without multiscattering.,width=321,height=321 ]    as we move to higher @xmath0 , the predicted asymmetry becomes more significant . as can be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : asylhc ] , both eps08 and hijing predict substantial asymmetry up to @xmath112 gev / c , and both variants of hijing asymmetries remaining significant up to @xmath113 gev / c , in contrast to eps08 .    at the present level ,",
    "neither model variant gives agreement with all aspects of the data : in an earlier calculation we have found that shadowing parameterizations which do not need to be augmented by a multiple scattering prescription  @xcite have difficulty describing central - to - peripheral ratios at forward rapidity  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that this also holds for the eps08 npdfs . on the other hand , the hijing parameterization with multiscattering yields pseudorapidity asymmetries below unity at low transverse momenta .",
    "this deficiency may be cured by allowing an @xmath0-dependent multiscattering  @xcite .",
    "here we give a concise summary of the results of our calculations .",
    "we have demonstrated the usefulness of asymmetric ( light - on - heavy ) nuclear collisions at relativistic energies . as illustrated in sec .",
    "[ shad_multiscatt ] , the physical differences between forward- and backward - going produced particles arise from the different ranges of @xmath57 sampled ( different shadowing ) and different amount of multiple scattering .",
    "this leads to observable pseudorapidity asymmetries at some collision energies and transverse momenta .",
    "we have considered the effects of nuclear shadowing and multiple scattering on pseudorapidity asymmetry for three asymmetric systems : @xmath10 , @xmath6 , and @xmath13 in a wide energy range .    to calibrate and fine - tune our model we first examined spectra of produced neutral pions .",
    "we found that there are two avenues in the model for the reasonable description of these data : ( i ) hijing shadowing , intrinsic @xmath37 , plus multiscattering , or ( ii ) some other npdfs ( we use eps08 here ) and intrinsic @xmath37 ( but no additional multiscattering ) .",
    "we then calculated pseudorapidity asymmetries with these prescriptions .",
    "overall , the calculated asymmetries are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data .",
    "intrinsic transverse momentum in the nucleon is seen to be important at low @xmath4 .",
    "multiple scattering increases the yield in the `` forward '' or positive pseudorapidity region , thus leading to a tendency for asymmetries less than unity at low @xmath4 in the scheme explicitely relying on multiple scattering , at variance with the data .",
    "an lhc measurement at a high pseudorapidity and high @xmath4 ( where @xmath37 effects no longer make a difference ) may be able to distinguish between strong shadowing ( as in the hijing prescription ) and an npdf with a relatively weaker gluon suppression ( like e.g. eps08 ) .",
    "a major constraint in assessing pseudorapidity asymmetries is the limited availability of data for direct comparison with theoretical calculations .",
    "more data in asymmetric light - on - heavy collisions separated with respect to positive and negative pseudorapidities are needed to judge calculated pseudorapidity asymmetries .",
    "at rhic , it is expected that the high - statistic @xmath6 run 8 is going to provide such a large data set .",
