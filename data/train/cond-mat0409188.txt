    "effective interfacial hamiltonians are widely used to describe the large - scale fluctuations that occur near surface critical phenomena such as wetting @xcite .",
    "of course these models are not truly microscopic but are usually considered valid for length scales larger than some appropriate cut - off .",
    "the prevailing belief is that interfacial models may be derived from more microscopic approaches if the bulk degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "needless to say this is an extremely difficult task and interfacial models still retain a partly phenomenological status .",
    "therefore it is interesting to develop a genuine microscopic approach to study interfacial behaviors .",
    "effective hamiltonians are used to describe the critical behavior also in homogeneous systems because they allow a direct implementation of renormalization group ( rg ) ideas . for such bulk systems , the hierarchical reference theory @xcite provides a systematic way to derive an effective hamiltonian from a given microscopic model @xcite .",
    "this theory , which implements the basic ideas of wilson momentum space renormalization group for microscopic hamiltonians , allows to derive an exact hierarchy of differential equations describing the evolution of the free energy and of the @xmath0-point correlation functions of the system when fluctuations on larger and larger length - scales are included .",
    "this hierarchy of differential equations can be closed , for example , by imposing an approximation for the pair correlation function , usually of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) form .",
    "already at this level of approximation , the hrt shows genuine non classical critical behavior .",
    "the extension of the hrt formalism to inhomogeneous systems would enable us to study the interfacial phase transition starting from the microscopic model , without the explicit introduction of effective interfacial hamiltonians .",
    "given two homogeneous phases , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in contact with a third passive phase ( a wall ) , we study the particular case of complete wetting in planar geometry @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the phase transition which corresponds to the growth of an infinitely thick liquid layer close to the wall when bulk phase coexistence is approached at fixed temperature .",
    "the standard fluctuation theory of the wetting transition , beyond the mean field approximation , is described by using the capillary wave ( cw ) effective hamiltonian in @xmath3 dimensions@xcite @xmath4 \\label{cw}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a collective coordinate which represents the distance of the @xmath6 interface from the wall , @xmath7 is the effective interface potential which describes the effective interaction between the wall and the @xmath6 interface and @xmath8 is the stiffness coefficient of the interface . for isotropic models",
    "@xmath8 can be identified with the surface tension , but it may also depend on the curvature of the interface .",
    "the form of effective interfacial potential @xmath7 depends on the range of the microscopic interaction . in the case of short range potentials , for large @xmath9",
    "it is parametrized as @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath0 are two dimensionless constants with @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 can be identified with the bulk correlation length .",
    "it is important to note that the use of such an effective surface hamiltonian can be justified only when bulk fluctuations are small _ i.e. _ far for bulk critical point @xcite . in three dimension ,",
    "renormalization group studies on the hamiltonian ( [ cw ] ) @xcite predict that the wetting critical behavior is non - universal depending on the value of the wetting parameter : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the _ true _ bulk correlation length which governs the exponential decay of correlations in real space @xcite . at the critical wetting transition ( _ i.e. _ wetting at coexistence ) the critical exponents depend on this parameter @xcite",
    "while at complete wetting ( _ i.e. _ wetting approaching coexistence ) the critical exponents are predicted to remain mean field like but critical amplitudes are @xmath16 dependent",
    ". for example the interface height @xmath9 grows as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the deviation of the chemical potential from the value at coexistence .",
    "the mean field approximation to an effective @xmath19 hamiltonian provides a value @xmath20 via eq.(4 ) .",
    "the three - dimensional semi - infinite ising model is one of the simplest microscopic models which may be simulated to test the rg predictions .",
    "the value of the wetting parameter @xmath16 is a function of the temperature and has been theoretically estimated @xcite : @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "extensive monte carlo @xcite simulation studies appear to be consistent with @xmath23 at @xmath24 @xcite a much smaller value than the predicted one .",
    "one possible solution of this discrepancy between the simulations and the rg results is the inadequacy of the cw hamiltonian and the introduction of more general effective interfacial hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the hrt theory , suitably generalized to deal with inhomogeneous systems , can be used to study the effects of thermal fluctuations beyond the mean field behavior without reference to the cw approach and so without introducing @xmath16 as an external parameter .",
    "we first obtain the hrt surface evolution equation for the ising model which is then numerically solved in the case of complete wetting in three dimensions .",
    "the divergence of the adsorption @xmath25 is studied when coexistence is approached and the critical amplitude is evaluated and compared to simulations .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section ii we extend hrt approach to the case of inhomogeneous systems with planar geometry .",
    "we derive the evolution equation for the bulk and surface free energy .",
    "we also show that in the asymptotic region the hrt equations reduce to the known rg approach . in section iii we study complete wetting for a lattice gas model with nearest - neighbor interactions ( which is equivalent to the ising model ) .",
    "we investigate how fluctuations modify the mean field picture by integrating the hrt surface equation . in section",
    "iv we briefly summarize the most relevant results and compare them to the avaliable simulation data .",
    "the starting point in the derivation of hrt equations is the separation of the inter - atomic potential @xmath26 in two parts : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the short - range repulsive part of @xmath29 .",
    "the thermodynamic and structural properties of the system with interaction @xmath28 , the `` reference system '' , are considered known , at least numerically .",
    "it is also assumed that there is no phase transition in the reference system .",
    "instead @xmath30 is a ( mostly ) attractive term , which triggers the liquid - vapor phase transition . using this separation and performing a legendre transformation on the grand partition function ,",
    "a formal diagrammatic expansion for the helmholtz free energy can be written to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we implement the basic ideas of wilson s rg approach @xcite within such a formal perturbative expansion to study how the bulk and surface thermodynamic quantities evolve due to the inclusion of fluctuations .",
    "this can be done by introducing a sequence of intermediate potentials characterized by an infrared cut - off in fourier space , depending on a parameter @xmath31 . in the hrt for ( off - lattice ) bulk systems",
    "this cut - off is spherical in fourier space , thereby respecting the isotropy of the interaction .",
    "here we want to consider the case of inhomogeneous systems in the presence of a planar wall , where only cylindrical symmetry survives in wave vector space .",
    "moreover , in wetting phenomena the correlation length parallel to the surface @xmath32 and the correlation length perpendicular to the surface @xmath33 are related by @xcite : @xmath34^{\\frac{1}{2 } } & d=3 \\\\ \\xi_\\parallel^{\\frac{3-d}{2 } } & d<3 \\end{array}\\right . \\label{perptopar}\\ ] ] this relationship suggests that the fluctuations perpendicular to the wall diverge much more slowly than the fluctuations parallel to the wall .",
    "therefore it is natural to define a sharp _ cylindrical _ cut - off @xcite which prevents long wavelength cw critical fluctuations . within the hrt approach , this is implemented by defining the sequence of intermediate potentials : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the component of the wave vector parallel to the surface and @xmath37 is the component normal to the wall .",
    "the system characterized by the potential @xmath38 will be named @xmath31-system . for @xmath39",
    ", @xmath40 reduces to @xmath41 while for @xmath42 the full interaction is recovered .",
    "therefore it is natural to look for evolution equations governing the change in the physical properties of the @xmath31-system as the cut - off is varied . in order to derive such evolution equations",
    ", we consider the structure of the perturbative series which defines the free energy of the model . in the perturbative diagrammatic expansion of the free energy of the @xmath31-system @xmath43 , every loop contains one or more @xmath44 bonds @xcite .",
    "therefore , due to the vanishing of @xmath45 for @xmath46 , @xmath43 is defined by the same perturbative expansion as the full free energy of the model , @xmath47 , where each ( longitudinal ) momentum integration is limited by an infrered cut - off @xmath31 .",
    "the correspondence between a cut - off in the potential and a cut - off in fluctuations ( i.e. in the momentum integrations ) is valid with the single exception of the first , mean field , diagram of the perturbation series which does not contain any loop .",
    "this contribution is in fact discontinuous in @xmath31 because it contains just the @xmath48 fourier component of the attractive potential ( [ cutoff ] ) which is zero for every @xmath49 and finite for @xmath50 .",
    "however we can introduce a modified free energy @xmath51 which is continuous in @xmath31 and is simply related to @xmath43 @xmath52 \\int d^d\\mathbf{r}\\;\\rho(\\mathbf{r})+ \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^d\\mathbf{r}_1d^d\\mathbf{r}_2\\ ; \\left [ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)-\\phi^q(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right ] \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho(\\mathbf{r}_2 )   \\label{modifieda}\\ ] ] analogously , we can introduce the direct correlation functions @xmath53 , for each @xmath31-system by functional derivation of the free energy @xmath43 with respect to the local density @xmath54 .",
    "these correlation functions are continuous in @xmath31 for @xmath55 because there are no zero loop contributions in the corresponding perturbative expansion , but the two point direct correlation function is discontinuous at @xmath56 .",
    "so we introduce a modified function which is continuous , being the second functional derivative of @xmath51 with respect to the density : @xmath57 .",
    "\\label{modifiedc}\\ ] ] it is apparent from the definitions ( [ modifieda ] ) and ( [ modifiedc ] ) that @xmath51 and @xmath58 coincide with the free energy and direct correlation function of the fully interacting system respectively when @xmath59 . on the other hand in the limit",
    "@xmath60 these modified quantities reproduce the mean field approximation for the free energy and the direct correlation function , contrary to @xmath43 and @xmath61 which reduce to the reference system quantities .",
    "this suggests that the hrt procedure does indeed describe the growth of fluctuations on top of the mean field approximation , as in the rg approach .    the simple relationship between the cut - off - dependent modified quantities ( @xmath51 and @xmath58 ) and the @xmath31-system properties ( @xmath43 and @xmath62 ) allows to derive the evolution equations describing how @xmath51 and @xmath63 change when @xmath31 is decreased from infinity to zero , _ i.e. _ when fluctuations on larger and larger length - scales are included .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the free energy can be specialized to the case where the reference system is the @xmath31-system and the perturbation potential is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an infinitesimal shift in the cut - off . by summing all terms linear in @xmath66 in the diagrammatic expansion of the free energy and taking the limit",
    "@xmath67 one obtains the evolution equation for the free energy .",
    "till now we have formally considered the total free energy , but for an inhomogeneous system it is useful to separate the bulk quantities , which refer to the homogeneous system without an external potential , from the surface terms due to the presence of the wall @xmath68 where the two point correlation function @xmath69 is the functional inverse of @xmath70 _ i.e. _ @xmath71 this differs from the known ornstein - zernike equation for inhomogeneous fluids because of the inclusion of the ideal gas terms .",
    "note that , due to the cylindrical cut - off , @xmath72 has lost the full rotational symmetry of the physical system for every @xmath73 .",
    "the separation in bulk and surface terms may be inserted in the diagrammatic expansion of the total helmholtz free energy .",
    "we begin with the derivation of the evolution equation for the bulk contribution to the free energy .",
    "only the one loop diagrams containing bulk @xmath74 bonds alone in the diagrammatic expansion contribute to the leading order in @xmath66 .",
    "the sum of these term can be carried out in closed form @xcite and reproduces the known random phase formal expression : @xmath75 this equation is not yet suitable for taking the @xmath67 limit because it contains the discontinuous function @xmath76 . expressing @xmath74 in terms of the continuous function @xmath77 via eqs .",
    "( [ modifiedc ] ) and ( [ oz ] ) we obtain : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a geometric factor defined by @xmath80 the initial condition must be imposed at @xmath81 and coincides with the mean field approximation for the helmholtz free energy of the fully interacting system .",
    "unfortunately , equation ( [ bulkeveq ] ) is not written in closed form because the evolution of the free energy depends on the knowledge of the two - particle correlation function @xmath82 at a generic value of cut - off @xmath31 .",
    "however , we can study how the two - particle function @xmath83 itself ( or equivalently @xmath84 ) is modified owing to the inclusion of fluctuations , by performing the same analysis leading to ( [ bulkeveq ] ) . in this way we obtain an evolution equation for the pair correlation function , but",
    "this equation contains the three - particle and the four - particle correlation functions .",
    "the procedure may be iterated to higher orders thereby obtaining an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations .",
    "this hierarchy may be truncated at the level of the first equation by introducing a suitable anstanz for the two - particle correlation function and using the compressibility sum rule @xcite which relates the second density derivative of free energy to the zero wave - vector limit of the pair correlation function @xmath85 note that this equation is exact for each @xmath31-system , it provides an extremely useful link between thermodynamics and the long wavelength limit of correlation functions but it is not sufficient to close the hierarchy because it does not give information about the momentum dependence of @xmath86 .    in the derivation of the bulk evolution equation , translational invariance allowed to perform the analytical resummation of the one loop diagrams leading to eq .",
    "( [ bulkeveq ] ) without specifying the form of @xmath87 . instead ,",
    "in order to express in closed form the sum of the required diagrams in the expansion of the surface free energies , we need to specialize to a particular form of the inhomogeneous two point correlation function @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand what type of fluctuations are described by @xmath88 .",
    "let us consider the case of a wetting transition between two bulk phases , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , in contact with a wall .",
    "at a temperature larger than the wetting temperature and slightly off coexistence , the system will consist of a slab of the wetting phase , with density @xmath89 , an interfacial region and the bulk @xmath90 phase . if @xmath91 , which is the bulk correlation function of the @xmath1 phase , is not equal to @xmath92 then @xmath88 , which is defined as @xmath93 , describes not only the correlations in the interfacial region but also in the slab . in this case",
    "it is difficult to find a suitable ansatz for the form of @xmath94 .",
    "however , in systems where the bulk correlation functions are the same for the two phases the problem simplifies and @xmath94 just describes the interfacial region .",
    "this is precisely the case of the lattice gas model with nearest - neighbor interaction ( i.e. of the ising model ) due to the symmetry @xmath95 .",
