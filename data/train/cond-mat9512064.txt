    "it is by now well understood that the presence of a small concentration of magnetic impurities into an otherwise non - magnetic metallic host can affect dramatically the low - temperature properties of the system .",
    "the prototype of these interesting phenomena is the kondo effect.@xcite at the single - impurity level , there is a non - perturbative crossover between a curie - weiss law behavior ( in which the impurity behaves like a non - interacting localized magnetic moment ) at high temperature , and a strongly interacting regime in which the magnetic impurity and the band electrons form a singlet ground state . in other words , in this low - temperature ( strong - coupling ) regime , the band electrons conspire to screen out the spin ( and magnetic moment ) of the impurity . at zero temperature a similar crossover occurs as a function of an external magnetic field .",
    "this picture has been developed by the concerted use of the renormalization group  @xcite ,  exact \" numerical simulations and scaling  @xcite , exact solutions via the bethe - ansatz  @xcite and large-@xmath2 expansions  @xcite .    from the point of view of scaling ,",
    "the kondo problem is a typical situation in which a trivial fixed point , which describes band electrons decoupled from the magnetic impurity , is destabilized by a _ marginally relevant _ perturbation , the coupling to the magnetic impurity .",
    "this leads to an _ asymptotically free _ renormalization group flow with a @xmath5-function which is quadratic in the coupling constant .",
    "marginal perturbations appear in critical systems at a _",
    "critical dimension_. the standard @xmath6 kondo hamiltonian is effectively a model of one dimensional chiral fermions coupled to a single magnetic impurity through the forward scattering channel  @xcite . clearly , in this case we are at the _",
    "lowest _ critical dimension .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the band electrons have a fermi surface where the density of states is finite and essentially constant .",
    "thus , the kondo effect is ultimately due to the availability of states in the electron band which can efficiently screen the impurity spin no matter how weak the exchange coupling constant may be .",
    "some time ago withoff and fradkin ( wf )  @xcite considered a genaralization of the kondo problem to systems in which the density of band electron states may actually go to zero at the fermi energy .",
    "they showed that if the density of states of the electron band vanishes at the fermi energy as a positive power of the energy , the kondo effect is suppressed for small values of the exchange constant and that the kondo screening only happens beyond a critical value of this coupling .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the exponent @xmath7 of the one particle density of states , @xmath8 plays a role here quite analogous to the distance to the lower critical dimension @xmath9 in critical phenomena .",
    "wf showed , using a combination of a  poor man s scaling argument \" and a large-@xmath2 limit , that at least for small values of the exponent @xmath7 , this is the correct picture . quite generally , if the exponent @xmath10 this is a non - marginal kondo system .",
    "there are a number of systems of physical interest where this situation does arise .",
    "a simple example are the fermionic excitations of a quantum antiferromagnet in a _ flux phase _  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the normal state excitations of a @xmath11-wave superconductor ( with symmetry @xmath1 ) behave precisely in this fashion  @xcite . in the vicinity of each _",
    "node _ of the gap function ( hence , the use of the term  node \" hereafter ) , the dispersion relation for the normal quasiparticles is linear in the momentum .",
    "thus , sufficiently close to the node , the quasiparticles have an effective relativistic - like dispersion . in the theory of superconductivity ( isotropic or not )  @xcite the dynamics of the quasiparticles is usually pictured in terms of nambu spinors . for the case of a d - wave superconductor , nersesyan , tsvelik and wenger  @xcite have shown that this approach leads to effective hamiltonian for the quasiparticles which takes the form of a massless dirac hamiltonian for each node of the gap , with the  speed of light \" equal to the fermi velocity .",
    "( naturally , relativistic massless dirac fermions themselves always have this property . ) in this paper we consider a model which describes properly the coupling of flux - phase fermions to a magnetic impurity .",
    "it turns out that this model can also be used to describe the coupling of a local magnetic impurity to a d - wave superconductor , including pair - breaking effects . in a separate publication",
    "we will discuss in detail the problem of a magnetic impurity in a @xmath11-wave superconductor in more detail  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the kondo effect for non - marginal systems .",
    "the model has fermions coupled locally to a magnetic impurity .",
    "the fermions are assumed to obey a relativistic - like dispersion law and hence a density of states vanishing linearly with the energy . for simplicity",
    "we consider models with just one species of  relativistic \" fermions",
    ". we will refer to them as  having a single node \" .",
    "in particular we will discuss the case of an impurity coupled to an electron band with a density of states that vanishes _ linearly _ with the distance to fermi energy @xmath12 . this case",
    "was not examined by wf who found that the singularity structure changed as soon as @xmath13 .",
    "we will show in this paper that at @xmath14 the additional singularities conspire to give _ simple scaling laws _ modified by _ logarithmic corrections _  @xcite .",
    "this picture is strongly reminiscent of a critical system at an _ upper _ critical dimension .    as in the conventional kondo problem , here",
    "too we can construct an effective one - dimensional theory .",
    "however , when one carefully reduces the @xmath4-dimensional fermions with a relativistic - like energy - momentum dispersion to an effective @xmath15-dimensional model , one finds that there are _ at least _ two angular momentum channels that are _ always _ coupled .",
    "thus , these are all _ inherently _ multichannel kondo systems .",
    "in particular , it is always the @xmath16 channel coupled either to @xmath17 channel or to @xmath18 channel .",
    "which pair of angular momentum channels are actually coupled depends on the _ parity _ of the node ( or cone ) to which the channels belong .",
    "we find two equivalent ways to represent the dimensionally reduced model .",
    "we have the freedom to choose the effective @xmath15-dimensional fermions to have a local kinetic energy and , hence , to behave like conventional right movers .",
    "however , in this picture , the effective interaction with the impurity becomes non - local .",
    "the other , alternative picture , is to have a local coupling between right moving fermions which now have a non - local kinetic energy .",
    "in fact , due to phase space factors , the density of states of the effective @xmath15-dimensional model goes to zero linearly with energy .",
    "the linearity of the density of states reflects the fact that in the original problem the fermions move in two - space dimensions .",
    "it is this feature what drives the system out of marginality and what generates a critical coupling constant below which the width of the kondo resonance vanishes .    in all cases of physical interest , _",
    "parity _ is an exact symmetry .",
    "this means that the number of nodes ( cones ) is _ even _ and that there should be as many cones with positive parity as there are with negative parity . in the case of both the @xmath11-wave superconductors and of the flux - phase fermions",
    ", this property follows from the alternating signs of the gap function .",
    "in contrast , if either parity or time reversal were broken , all four cones would have the same properties under parity .",
    "however , in that case there would always be a non - zero energy gap on the entire fermi surface .",
    "thus , in general , the effective kondo hamiltonians always have an exact degeneracy ( angular momentum channels ) .",
    "the spin symmetry is the usual @xmath19 spin rotation invariance ( which here we call _ color _ ) . here",
    "we will work with the @xmath20 generalization of this symmetry , with the physical @xmath21 .",
    "the angular momentum degeneracy leads to and @xmath22 _ flavor _ degeneracy . for a problem with one node , @xmath23 .",
    "when more than one node is considered , @xmath24 .",
    "we will also consider impurity scattering amplitudes which may change the angular momentum of the fermions .",
    "the basic and simplest model is worked out in section [ sec : toy ] .    in the second part of the paper we use large-@xmath2 methods to investigate the behavior of these systems near the critical coupling  @xcite .",
    "we find that there is still a kondo scale once we go over the critical coupling .",
    "however , the position and the width of the resonance are not related anymore in the very simple way they are in the usual kondo effect .",
    "the details are worked out in section [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "the most salient feature of our results is the presence of logarithmic corrections to simple scaling in all quantities of physical interest , including the zero - field paramagnetic suceptibility ( at @xmath25 ) , the kondo scale and the @xmath3-matrix for bulk fermions .",
    "the large-@xmath26 theory that we present here suggests the following scenario . for small values of the coupling constant @xmath27 ,",
    "the impurity is free and effectively paramagnetic .",
    "in contrast , for large values of @xmath27 , the impurity is screened by the fermions .",
    "the critical coupling @xmath28 is dimensionful and scales with the energy cutoff .",
    "however , the fact that these systems are inherently multichannel kondo systems suggests that for @xmath29 the impurity is actually _ overscreened _  @xcite . in the language of the renormalization group",
    "this requires a flow with two finite fixed points : one _ infrared unstable _ fixed point for the paramagnetic - kondo phase transition and an _ infrared stable _ to describe the multichannel behavior of the kondo phase . as in the conventional kondo problem",
    ", the large-@xmath26 theory can only describe the formation of the kondo singlet which in a non - marginal system can only take place at finite coupling .",
    "in marginal kondo systems multichannel behavior is found as a next - to - leading order effect in the @xmath30 expansion or to third order in perturbative scaling  @xcite . in the systems of physical interest",
    "mentioned above where this model applies , the number of channels @xmath31 is always larger than the number of colors .",
    "in such a situation one can imagine that there exists a critical number of channels such that both fixed points actually coincide and below this critical number the transition dissapears altogether  @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize here that this physics can not be accessed by a straightforward use of the large-@xmath26 expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "toy ] we derive the effective @xmath15-dimensional impurity models for systems of fermions in two space dimensions with relativistic - like dispersion ( flux phase ) . in section  [",

    "section [ sec : conc ] is devoted to the conclusions and to the discussions of the similarities and differences between the problem we discuss here and the conventional kondo problem . in appendix",
    "a we sketch the calculations of a few integrals .",
    "in this section we want to study the s - d hamiltonian a la read and newns @xcite , with the difference that we are not assuming a constant density of states for the conduction fermions .",
    "we are coupling an f - impurity to a bath of ",
    "relativistic \" electrons , _ ie . , _ electrons with a linear dispersion relation .",
    "we assume the chemical potential for the electrons ( the fermi energy ) is zero .",
    "this is a very special case but it will turn out to be quite important for the case of a d - wave superconductor as it will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "we start with a two - dimensional free fermion hamiltonian with a linear spectrum and a fermi velocity @xmath33 which may correspond to the linearization of a fermion band of width @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an energy cutoff .",
    "we will consider a model of band fermions with @xmath36 spin components with @xmath37 for the physically relevant case of spin @xmath19 .",
    "in general , this model will have a global @xmath20  color \" ( or spin ) symmetry .",
    "this model has a well defined large-@xmath2 limit .",
    "the free part of the hamiltonian is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are pauli matrices , so that @xmath41 eq.([eq : hdirac ] ) can be diagonalized by expanding the fields into a linear combination of spinor eigenstates .",

    "even though we may regard the impurity as having a @xmath69-function spatial form factor as in the case of the usual kondo effect , the coupling to the fermions will no longer be restricted only to the s - wave , or the spherically symmetric angular momentum channel .",

    "the non - trivial fixed point at @xmath201 separates the weak coupling phase from a strong coupling phase that , in principle , should exhibit a kondo effect .",
    "this unstable fixed point can be regarded as the usual marginally unstable fixed point of the standard kondo problem , now pushed to a finite value of the coupling constant by effect of the reduction of the density of band states .",

    "the case of a magnetic impurity coupled to a fermi system with a linear density of states seems to be analogous to the behavior of critical systems at their upper critical dimension .",
    "in contrast , the case of the constant density of states is the analog of a critical system at the lower critical dimension ( marginal instability ) .",
    "the closest analog to this problem is the critical behavior of the gross - neveu model in @xmath206 ( space - time ) dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the results that we find here hold for the simple regime of large @xmath26 which does not describe correctly the dynamics of the system with more than one fermion flavor . at this leading order in @xmath30 , the existence of several channels is only reflected into a trivial degeneracy and it does not lead to any new physics .",
    "however , as has been shown by blandin and nozires  @xcite , already the leading corrections in @xmath30 will lead to non - trivial behavior in the  screened \" phase , @xmath207 . in the standard kondo problem , this behavior was confirmed by both the bethe - ansatz solution  @xcite and conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "we note here that , due to the non - local character of the effective one - dimensional theory discussed in section [ sec : toy ] , it is not possible to use neither the bethe - ansatz nor conformal field theory to study the non - critical kondo problem that we discuss here .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the physics of the phase with @xmath204 should be similar to that of the conventional overscreend kondo problem .",
    "we also note that , in a more realistic model , one expects _ four _ nodes with two nodes of each chirality and , hence with more flavors and a more pronounced overscreened behavior .",
    "we close this section with a discussion of the zero - field susceptibility for this model .",
    "the coupling of a magnetic field only to the impurity spin has the form of a zeeman term @xmath208 here , @xmath209 are the elements of a suitably chosen @xmath20 diagonal generator , which also includes the appropriate normalization factors so as to set the bohr magneton to one .",
    "we will need to ensure the tracelessness of the generator , and we can do so by keeping all the elements of order one with alternating signs . in this way we prevent the case of overpopulating one of the states that the zeeman term splits with respect to the others , _",
    "i.e. , _ we explicitly avoid cases like the one with @xmath210 elements being @xmath211 and the last element being @xmath210 .",

    "this is consistent with the impurity being screeened ( kondo effect ) for a value of the coupling constant bigger than the critical value .",
    "however , as we approach the critical coupling constant from the screening ( kondo ) phase , the susceptibility must diverge , since for values of the coupling lower than the critical value , @xmath136 vanishes and the impurity effectively decouples from the band .",

    "in contrast , the computation of the correlation function @xmath227 , for @xmath228 and @xmath229 away from the impurity will involve a mixing of all the angular momentum channels .",

    "in contrast , for a flat band , the @xmath3-matrix is diagonal in angular momentum states .",
    "this matrix element is not invariant under @xmath22 since it mixes the angular momentum channels . as we pointed out above , this is a consequance of the unphysical spontaneous breaking of the flavor ( channel ) symmetry .",

    "we see immediately that we have a resonance centered at @xmath256 , which is basically the kondo scale @xmath107 that we found in section [ sec : scaling ] but modified by the ubiquitous logarithmic corrections . in particular , the position of the kondo resonance scales with the distance to the critical coupling constant and it goes to zero ( the fermi energy ) at @xmath28 .",
    "the resonance width @xmath257 can be read off from eq.([eq : imt ] ) @xmath266 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phaseshift ] ) it is clear that the dimensionless parameter @xmath267 sets the scale for the range of the scattering amplitude .",
    "thus , as far as transport properties such as the resistivity are concerned , @xmath136 is the important parameter , whereas thermodynamic properties such as the suceptibility , depend entirely on the impurity energy scale @xmath107 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the kondo scale @xmath203 .",
    "the analysis done in the last section shows that , due to the strong logarithmic corrections , these two scales are completely different .",
    "once again , in the conventional kondo effect , @xmath203 controls both effects .    hence , in contrast with conventional kondo behavior , the interaction with the magnetic impurity induces a non - trivial renormalization of the propagator of the band fermions .",
    "this will happen even for @xmath268 , although this effect only occurs in higher order in @xmath30 .",
    "finally we stress that , due to the @xmath22 flavor symmetry , there can not be any channel mixing scattering processes in this model .",
    "however , in the following section , we will present a model which describes the most general impurity scattering processes for systems with only one node . in that model the channel ( or flavor ) symmetry @xmath22",
    "is broken explicitly already at the level of the impurity hamiltonian .",
    "thus we expect to find processes which will mix the various channels .",
    "in the past sections we considered a situation in which the fermions coupled to the impurity spin only through their own spin density @xmath269 . scattering processes of this type have the simplifying feature that particles and holes interact with the impurity independently from each other and exactly in the same way .",
    "however , in practice , more general scattering processes will be present .",
    "we also made the assumption that only one node of the two - dimensional fermions is present .    here",
    ", we will consider all possible scattering processes involving _ only one node_. the coupling through the spin density has the very special feature that it is _ diagonal _ in the components of the spinors , _",
    "i.e. , _ the impurity does not mix particles with holes . in terms of the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : halt ] ) , this diagonal coupling implies that there is no _ explicit _ mixing of angular momentum channels .",
    "hence , the model has an @xmath22 symmetry ( with @xmath23 ) .",
    "any process which mixes particles and holes will break the flavor symmetry explicitly .",
    "we will include now these processes .",
    "we will also incorporate the correct node structure .",
    "for example , in the case of a flux phase say , on a square lattice , there will be four different _ nodes _ corresponding to the symmetry points @xmath270 of the first brillouin zone . as we discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , a @xmath11-wave superconductor has an analogous node structure , at the points where the gap has nodes .",
    "we will discuss of this very interesting case in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the main effect of a more general node structure is to _ increase _ the number of _ flavors _ in the effective model . in the one - node model of the previous section we found that there were two flavors and an @xmath19 flavor symmetry .",
    "the existence of two flavors can be traced back to the spinor structure of the original problem .",
    "when the two - dimensional fermions have more than one node , the number of flavors becomes _ twice the number of nodes _ , @xmath271 .",
    "thus , for a flux phase we will have @xmath272 flavors .",
    "however , flux phases are _ even _ under parity . hence , there are two pairs of nodes with opposite parity .",
    "the parity of the node is given by the _ relative sign _ of the two terms in the free fermion hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) .",
    "thus , a change of parity is equivalent to the mapping @xmath273 , in other words to a reflection across the @xmath274 axis . in section [ sec : toy ]",
    "we showed that , with the choice of parity we made there , the channels with angular momenta @xmath16 and @xmath18 get mixed by the impurity . hence ,",
    "if nodes with the other parity are also included , we will also get mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath275 , but no direct mixing between @xmath275 and @xmath276 . in section [ sec : toy ]",
    "we also found that only the mapping between the components of the original fermion and the fermions of the effective one - dimensional theory carried information about which angular momentum components are mixed .",
    "this feature is always present .",
    "thus , the net effect of having a multinode structure is to increase the number of flavors .",
    "consequently , although the thermodynamic properties will be insensitive to parity assignments , the scattering amplitudes of the original fermions with the impurity will carry the information of the parity of the nodes .",
    "this feature can be used to determine the nature of a superconducting state .    in what follows",
    ", we will consider a system with four nodes , two with positive parity and two with negative parity , interacting with a single magnetic impurity .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the impurity form factor is strongly peaked at small momentum , so that inter - node scattering processes can be ignored .",

    "this is the region of the phase diagram below the line @xmath333 .",
    "this is the weak - coupling phase .",
    "the magnetic impurity is effectively decoupled from the band electrons . to leading order in @xmath30",
    "the impurity does not interact with the band fermions and behaves like a free magnetic moment .",
    "consequently the impurity spin suceptibility is infinite , there is no resonance and there is no kondo screening .",
    "both @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
    "there is no consistent solution of this form unless @xmath336 .",
    "in other words , this case is possible only if the only non - vanishing coupling constant is @xmath112 , with @xmath337 , in which case we do have the @xmath317 symmetry .",
    "this is the line on the axis @xmath190 of the figure  [ figure ] for @xmath207 ;    @xmath338 , @xmath339 .",
    "a solution of this form satisfies the equations @xmath340 the action of this solution is given by @xmath341 for a solution of this type , @xmath342 and @xmath343 are determined by @xmath344 through the relations @xmath345 this solution is only allowed above the line @xmath346 in the phase diagram .",
    "this is the kondo or screening phase .",
    "the results of the previous sections apply to this phase .",
    "@xmath338 , @xmath347 .",
    "the spe s also allow for solutions of this form . in principle",
    "such solutions are allowed above the line @xmath348 .",
    "the spe s for this solution are exactly the same ones found in ( c ) with @xmath349 replaced by @xmath350 .",
    "clearly this solution competes with the solution of case ( c ) over a significant region of the phase diagram .",
    "in fact its allowed region is completely included within the allowed region for ( c ) .",
    "however , we argue that this solution is always metastable and never occurs .",
    "in fact , for any finite value of @xmath351 , the interaction between the impurity and the band electrons will be stronger in case ( c ) since @xmath352 , favoring the first case in much the same way in which the bonding state is preferred to the antibonding one when the degeneracy in a two - level system is lifted by a perturbation .",
    "it is easy to check that this is indeed correct by looking for solutions of both types in the vicinity of the phase transition , for @xmath190 close to @xmath217 and @xmath351 small .",
    "in addition , since there is no actual symmetry change between these two  phases \" , we do not expect a phase transition .",
    "we conclude that the generalized impurity model has just two phases : a phase with an unscreened impurity and a phase with a kondo effect .",
    "the phase boundary is at the line @xmath346 .",
    "the physics of the kondo phase is almost identical to what was described in the previous sections .",
    "in fact , at the level of the @xmath32 theory , the physical observables of the generalized impurity model can be calculated using the formulas for the single node model of the previous sections .",
    "the main difference is that , since the @xmath317 flavor symmetry at each node is now broken by the explicit form of the impurity hamiltonian , operators with non - trivial matrix elements in that sector are now allowed .",
    "in particular , there will be non - vanishing , finite , off - diagonal matrix elements of the band fermion @xmath3-matrix .",
    "in other words , the impurity will mix band fermion states with different angular momentum .",
    "in contrast , processes which mix different nodes are still strictly forbidden .",
    "finally we note that scattering processes of the type described here effectively reduce the number of independent channels .",
    "if it were not for the existence of several nodes , we would expect to find a kondo effect in this phase with a completely screened impurity .",
    "once again , the existence of additional channels associated with the multinode structure turns this into a multichannel kondo system if inter - node scattering processes are not allowed .",
    "in this paper we have considered the problem of flux - phase fermions coupled locally to a single magnetic impurity .",
    "this is formally the same as the problem of fermions with a relativistic dispersion in two space dimensions couped to a local spin .",
    "we derived explicitely an effective theory in one - space dimension .",
    "the physics of the effective one - dimensional theory for this problem differs from the conventional radial picture of the kondo problem in several important ways .",
    "firstly , it is always a multichannel system .",
    "the channels reflect the spinor structure of the nodes and the multiplicity of nodes .",
    "secondly , the relativistic dispersion implies a density of states which vanishes linearly at the fermi energy .",
    "consequently , unlike the conventional kondo model , the effective one - dimensional problem has a non - local coupling between the effective right movers and the impurity .",
    "this is the feature that drives the kondo effect away from marginality and it is responsible for the phase transition between an unscreened impurity phase and a phase with a kondo effect .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results of withoff and fradkin .",
    "however , for the case of the linearly vanishing density of states that we discussed in this paper , the nature of the scaling in the vicinity of this zero - temperature phase transition is drastically changed .",
    "we find that all physical quantities exhibit very simple scaling laws modified by logarithmic corrections .",
    "we found this behavior in the kondo scale and in the impurity spin suceptibility .",
    "this behavior is strongly reminscent of critical phenomena at an upper critical dimension .",
    "one important consequence of the logarithmic corrections is that there are more dynamical scales and that all physical quantities are no longer controlled by the kondo scale @xmath203 alone .",
    "this is particularly clear if one compares the amplitude of the @xmath3-matrix and the position and width of the kondo resonance .",
    "the model we studied and solved here using large-@xmath2 methods is an interesting problem on its own right . in a subsequent publication",
    "we will report on a study of a similar model for magnetic impurities in @xmath11-wave superconductors where we will draw heavily on the ideas that we developed here .",
    "it is interesting to compare the effective one - dimensional model that we derived here with the conventional one - dimensional models for the conventional kondo problem .",
    "the standard kondo problem is equivalent to a model in one space dimension with a single right mover which interacts locally with the impurity spin through the fermion spin density .",
    "this coupling through a density is crucial for the physics of the kondo problem to be correctly described by the model of right moving fermions .",
    "the fact that the fermions are chiral ( namely , only right movers are present ) means that , up to a fermi velocity , the fermion density and current are the same observable .",
    "this model can be described entirely in terms of a conserved current .",
    "this is the starting point of the conformal field theory approach of affleck and ludwig@xcite .",
    "however , it is also crucial for the success of the approach of anderson , yuval and hamman@xcite .",
    "in fact , the equivalence that exists between kondo systems and problems of macroscopic quantum coherence@xcite rely heavily on bosonization of models of fermion coupled locally to impurities through a density .",
    "the fact that this density is associated to a conserved current means that it can not acquire anomalous dimensions .",
    "thus , the fixed points of the conventional kondo contains only marginal operators which are made marginally relevant by quantum fluctuations .    from this analysis",
    "it is clear that it is not possible to describe the phase transition that we discuss here in terms of a conformal field theory coupled to local boundary operators representing the impurity .",
    "the non - locality of the effective one - dimensional theory is essential .",
    "it is because the model is non - local that the operator that couples to the impurity can ( and does ) acquire an anomalous dimension .",
    "this is the mechanism which drives the phase transition .",
    "these models are not equivalent to any standard macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) model .",
    "it may appear that , because the density of states vansihes like a power of the energy , these models could be related to a subohmic mqt system which are known not to have phase transitions . however , subohmic mqt models of quantum impurities coupled to a macroscopic _ bosonic _ system , with subohmic spectral density . the models that we discussed here",
    "are fermionic and are not equivalent to a subohmic bosonic theory .",
