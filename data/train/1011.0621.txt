    "the negative values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 demonstrate the non - markovianity of the dynamical process in this example too .    we emphasize here that the negative values of the relative entropy difference and fidelity difference serve as _ qualitative _ reflections of deviation from a cp markovian behavior  with no specific importance attached to the degree of negativity .",
    "further , the positive regions in the figures , _ do not _ indicate that the process is being markovian in these regions  because our criteria offer only sufficient ( not necessary ) tests of non - markovianity .",
    "it is also worth pointing out here that had we considered initially uncorrelated ( or zero discord ) states , a cp dynamical map associated with the same unitary dynamics ( [ ue ] ) , would also be expected to exhibit non - markovianity  @xcite . in other words , it is not evident if the departure from markovianity is entirely from the ncp nature ( resulting due to intially correlated states ) or from the built - in non - markovianity associated with the dynamics .",
    "it remains an open question to recognize distinct signatures of ncp non - markovianity emerging exclusively due to initial system - environment correlations .",
    "while open system evolution was formulated nearly five decades ago  with the introduction of dynamical @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps  by sudarshan et .",
    "al  @xcite , several interesting questions on the nature of dynamical maps are being raised recently  @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that ncp dynamical maps make their presence felt in the reduced dynamics obtained from the joint unitary evolution , if the system and environment are in an initially correlated state  @xcite .",
    "conceptual understanding of positive  but ncp dynamical maps  has thus been attracting increasing attention . in this paper",
    ", we have developed a canonical structure for the @xmath0-map , and shown that this canonical @xmath0-map offers an elegant approach to investigate if the dynamics is cp / ncp .",
    "manifestations of memory effects in cp open system quantum evolution has been investigated in a previous work by some of us  @xcite and here , we have focused on exploring departure of cp markovianity in a specifically chosen ncp dynamics  @xcite with initially correlated system - environment states .",
    "we have proposed a test to verify deviations from cp markovianity , based on the relative entropy of the dynamical state of the system  which together with an analogous characterization  @xcite , in terms of the fidelity  is employed here to study prevalent memory effects in the ncp evolution .",
    "we have examined three different examples with diverse kinds of initial correlations  such as two qubits in ( i ) a pure entangled state , ( ii ) werner state ( mixed two qubit state which encompasses both entangled and separable states depending on a single real parameter @xmath113 ) and ( iii ) a separable state . all the three dynamical examples considered here display non - markovianity .",
    "however , it is not evident if the reflections of non - markovianity are essentially arising due to ncp nature of the process ( initially correlated states of qubits ) .",
    "this leaves open an important question : are there any distinct signatures of non - markovianity emerging entirely because of the ncp nature of the dynamical process ?",
