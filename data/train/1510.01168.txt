    "in this note , we announce the classification in @xcite of spectral stability of roll - wave solutions of the `` viscous '' st . venant equations for inclined shallow - water flow , taking into account drag and viscosity . written in nondimensional eulerian form , the shallow water equations for a thin film down an incline are @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the froude number and @xmath5 is the inverse of the reynolds number .",

    "the terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the right hand side of the second equation model , respectively , gravitational force and turbulent friction along the bottom .",
    "roll - waves are well - known hydrodynamic instabilities of ( [ swe1 ] ) , arising in the region @xmath10 for which constant solutions , corresponding to parallel flow , are unstable .",
    "they are commonly found in man - made conduits such as aqueducts and spillways , and have been reproduced in laboratory flumes @xcite .",
    "however , up until now , there has been no complete rigorous stability analysis of viscous st .",
    "venant roll - waves either at the linear ( spectral ) or nonlinear level .",
    "roll - waves may be modeled as periodic wave train solutions of ( [ swe1 ] ) . in @xcite , it was proved for a large class of viscous conservation laws and under suitable spectral assumptions that periodic wave trains are nonlinearly stable ( in a spatially - modulated sense ) . in @xcite",
    "this nonlinear analysis has been extended to encompass all periodic wave train solutions of the shallow water system ( [ swe1 ] ) that satisfy those spectral assumptions .",
    "the main issue then is the verification of such assumptions . here",
    ", we provide a complete description of the set of stable roll - waves of ( [ swe1 ] ) : for each froude number @xmath10 , we exhibit ( either theoretically or numerically ) the range of spatial periods where stable roll - waves are found . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first complete result of stability in the case of shallow water equations .",
    "however , let us mention the study in @xcite : there , the authors studied the _ modulational stability _ of dressler _ inviscid _ roll - waves .",
    "a set of modulation equations is derived by assuming that the parameters which encode the roll - waves slowly vary in time and space : lack of hyperbolicity of the modulation equations is expected to provide a sufficient criterion for spectral instability of roll - waves under special kinds of large scale perturbations .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce the spectral problem and recall the spectral assumptions that have to be verified in order to obtain nonlinear stability of periodic waves . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we consider the intermediate froude number regime @xmath11 .",
    "we find a dramatic transition around @xmath12 from the small - f description of stability to a remarkably simple power - law description of surfaces bounding from above and below regions in parameter space corresponding to stable waves .",
    "these surfaces eventually intersect , yielding instability for all sufficiently large @xmath1 . in section [ sec4 ] , we focus on two asymptotic regimes : @xmath2 ( onset ) and @xmath3 . as @xmath2 ,",
    "the shallow water equations reduce to a generalized kuramoto - sivashinsky equation and we obtain asymptotic analytic formula for the stability boundaries . as @xmath3 , we exhibit a non - trivial regime and an asymptotic model which admits only unstable roll - waves , indicating the instability of roll - waves for sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "as the full nonlinear theory is given in lagrangian coordinates of mass @xcite , for the sake of consistency we rewrite the viscous shallow water system ( [ swe1 ] ) as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes now a lagrangian marker rather than a physical location @xmath16 , satisfying the relations @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between periodic waves of the lagrangian and eulerian forms .",
    "it also holds for the spectral problem in its floquet - by - floquet description ; see @xcite .",
    "thus there is no loss of information in choosing to work with the lagrangian form .",

    "our investigation roughly consists of two steps . to determine the global picture of spectrum of a linear @xmath20-periodic operator @xmath27 , we use hill s method , a galerkin based truncation procedure which is implemented into stablab @xcite . however , this method is not sufficient to study the spectrum near the origin and thus to verify hypothesis ( d1 ) , ( d2 ) and ( d3 ) . for that purpose",
    ", we used the evaluation of the evans function and its derivatives on contours to determine the coefficients and estimate the error terms in the expansion of @xmath52 .",
    "a suitable parameterization , available for all froude numbers , is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the _ total outflow _ and @xmath20 is the period . in @xcite we have gathered numerous pieces of evidence leading to the clear picture that from @xmath1 near @xmath55 and onward , stability is determined by simple relations @xmath56 with higher and higher accuracy as @xmath1 increases , for some universal constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "various weakly nonlinear models have been derived depending crucially on the scaling between time and space and mildly on the precise form of the diffusion term and on whether or not a vanishing viscosity regime is under consideration . in the korteweg - de vries regime @xmath66 and in the small amplitude limit @xmath67 , one obtains the generalized kuramoto - sivashinsky equation @xcite ( up to additional rescaling ) : @xmath68 the spectral and nonlinear stability of periodic traveling waves of ( [ gks ] ) in the limit @xmath69 is fully described in @xcite and a companion paper @xcite .",

    "numerical observations support this expectation .",
    "to consider now the infinite - froude number limit @xmath3 , we introduce a suitable rescaling in the equations and profiles with the requirements that ( i ) the limiting system ( @xmath3 ) be nontrivial and ( ii ) the limit be a regular perturbation .",
    "this results in a one - parameter family of rescalings indexed by @xmath82 , given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are real constants . under this rescaling , we find that @xmath20-periodic traveling wave solutions of ( [ swe2 ] ) correspond to @xmath87-periodic solutions to the rescaled profile equation @xmath88 where @xmath89 . noting that the behavior of @xmath90 as @xmath3 depends on whether @xmath91 or @xmath92 , one obtains two classes of limiting profile equations as @xmath3 . an additional rescaling @xmath93 and @xmath94 yields the associated spectral problem @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the perturbation of the underlying state @xmath97 .",
    "observe that for @xmath92 the limiting profile equations , selection principles , and spectral problems are independent of the specific value of @xmath98 .",
