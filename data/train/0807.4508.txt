    "the einstein - de sitter ( e - des ) universe with @xmath1 is the simplest model consistent with the spatial flatness expectation of inflationary cosmology . however , type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) at redshift @xmath2 appear @xmath3 fainter than expected in an e - des universe @xcite . together with measurements of galaxy clustering in the two - degree field survey @xcite and of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )",
    "@xcite , this has established an accelerating universe with a dominant cosmological constant term ( or other form of ` dark energy ' ) which presumably reflects the present microphysical vacuum state .",
    "this ` concordance ' @xmath0cdm cosmology ( with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) has passed a number of cosmological tests , including baryonic acoustic oscillations @xcite and measurements of mass fluctuations from clusters and weak lensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further observations of both sne  ia @xcite and the wmap 3-year results @xcite have continued to firm up the model",
    ". however there is no physical basis for this model , in particular there are two fundamental problems with the notion that the universe is dominated by vacuum energy .",
    "the first is the notorious fine - tuning problem of vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory  the energy scale of the cosmological energy density is @xmath7 gev , many orders of magnitude below the energy scale of @xmath8 gev of the standard model of particle physics , not to mention the planck scale of @xmath9 gev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the second is the equally acute coincidence problem : since @xmath10 evolves as the cube of the cosmic scale factor @xmath11 , there is no reason to expect it to be of @xmath12 _ today _ , yet this is apparently the case .",
    "in fact what is actually inferred from observations is _ not _ an energy density , just a value of @xmath13 for the otherwise unconstrained @xmath0 term in the friedmann equation .",
    "it has been suggested that this may simply be an artifact of interpreting cosmological data in the ( oversimplified ) framework of a perfectly homogeneous universe in which @xmath14 is the _ only _ scale in the problem @xcite .",
    "in fact the wmap results alone do _ not _ require dark energy if the assumption of a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum is relaxed .",
    "this assumption is worth examining given our present ignorance of the physics behind inflation .",
    "we have demonstrated @xcite that the temperature angular power spectrum of an e - des universe with @xmath15 matches the wmap data well if the primordial power is enhanced by @xmath16 in the region of the second and third acoustic peaks ( corresponding to spatial scales of @xmath17 ) .",
    "this alternative model with _ no _ dark energy actually has a slightly better @xmath18 for the fit to wmap-3 data than the ` concordance power - law @xmath0cdm model ' and , inspite of having more parameters , has an _ equal _ value of the akaike information criterion used in model selection .",
    "other e - des models with a broken power - law spectrum @xcite have also been shown to fit the wmap data .",
    "moreover , an e - des universe can fit measurements of the galaxy power spectrum if it includes a @xmath19 component of hot dark matter in the form of massive neutrinos of mass @xmath20  ev @xcite .",
    "clearly the main evidence for dark energy comes from the sne  ia hubble diagram .    a mechanism that sets @xmath21 is arguably more plausible than one which leads to the tiny energy density @xmath22 gev@xmath23 associated with the concordance cosmology .",
    "if @xmath0 is indeed zero then perhaps some effect fools us into wrongly deducing the existence of dark energy by _ mimicking _ a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "it is natural to connect this effect with inhomogenities since cosmic acceleration and large scale nonlinear structure formation appear to have commenced simultaneously .",
    "this approach offers the possibility of solving the cosmological constant problems within the framework of general relativity and keeps the introduction of new physics to a minimum .",
    "has to be introduced _ by hand _ , just as in quintessence models the quintessence field has to be given a mass of order @xmath24  these are technically _ unnatural _ choices since this is an infrared scale for any microphysical theory . ] several different ways in which inhomogenities could potentially mimic dark energy have been considered in the literature  for reviews see @xcite . in an inhomogeneous universe",
    "averaged quantities satisfy modified friedmann equations which contain extra terms corresponding to ` backreaction ' since the operations of spatial averaging and time evolution do not commute @xcite .",
    "the backreaction terms depend upon the variance of the local expansion rate and hence increase as inhomogenities develop . whether backreaction can indeed account for the apparent cosmological acceleration is hotly debated and remains an open question at present @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that inhomogeneities affect light propagation on large scales and cause the luminosity distance - redshift relation to resemble that expected for an accelerating universe .",
    "this has been investigated for a ` swiss - cheese ' universe in which voids modelled by patches of lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) space - time are distributed throughout a homogenous background .",
    "however , the results seem to be model dependent : some authors find the change in light propagation to be negligible because of cancellation effects @xcite , whereas @xcite claim it can partly mimic dark energy if the voids have radius 250 mpc @xcite . @xcite",
    "has noted that observers may preferentially choose sky regions with underdense foregrounds when studing distant objects such as sne  ia , so the expansion rate along the line - of - sight is then greater than average ; such a selection effect he argues can allow an inhomogeneous universe to fit the observations without dark energy .",
    "in this paper we are mainly interested in a ` local void ' ( sometimes referred to as `` hubble bubble '' ) as an explanation for dark energy ; to prevent an excessive cmb dipole moment due to our peculiar velocity we must be located near the centre of the void .",
    "an underdense void expands faster than its surroundings , thus younger supernovae inside the void would be observed to be receding more rapidly than older supernovae outside the void . under the assumption of homogeneity",
    "this would lead to the mistaken conclusion that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating , although both the void and the global universe are actually decelerating .",
    "henceforth we use the ` hubble contrast ' @xmath25 to characterise the void expansion rate , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the hubble parameters inside and outside the void respectively .",
    "( other authors have used the ` jump ' @xmath28 to characterise the void . ) the reduced hubble parameter @xmath29 is defined as usual by @xmath30 km @xmath31 @xmath32 throughout",
    ".    the local void scenario has been investigated by several authors using a variety of methods @xcite . in a series of papers ,",
    "tomita modelled the void as a open friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) region joined by a singular mass shell to a frw background and found that a void with radius 200 mpc and @xmath33 fits the supernova hubble diagram without dark energy @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a ltb region which reduces to a e - des cosmology with @xmath34 at a radius of 1.4  gpc with @xmath35 can match both the supernova data and the location of the first acoustic peak in the cmb .",
    "@xcite attempted to find the smallest possible void consistent with the current supernova results  their ltb - based ` minimal void ' model has a radius of 350 mpc and @xmath36 i.e. @xmath37 ; a void of similiar size but with @xmath38 had been discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , since this model is equivalent to an e - des universe with @xmath39 _ outside _ the void where the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxies lie , as it stands it is unable to fit the measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "ltb models of much larger voids were considered by @xcite ( with radii of 2.3 gpc and 2.5 gpc and hubble contrasts of 0.18 and 0.30 respectively ) and it was demonstrated they can fit the supernova data , bao data and the location of the first cmb peak . @xcite found the best fit to the sne ia data for a void of radius @xmath41 gpc and an underdensity of about @xmath42 at the centre and @xcite confirmed that such a void provides an excellent fit to the latest ` union dataset ' @xcite .",
    "moreover @xcite have shown that the unexpected alignment of the low multipoles in the cmb anisotropy can be attributed to the existence of a local void of radius @xmath43  @xmath44 .",
    "these authors also suggested that the anomalous ` cold spot ' in the wmap southern sky is due to a similar void at @xmath45 and some evidence for this has emerged subsequently @xcite .",
    "recently , a large number of voids of varying sizes have been identified in the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) catalog in a search for the late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect due to dark energy @xcite .",
    "how likely is the existence of such huge voids according to standard theories of structure formation ?",
    "statistical measures of the void distribution such as the void probability function and underdense probability function have been estimated from the 2dfgrs , sdss and deep2 galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "void probability statistics have also been examined theoretically using analytical methods @xcite and n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "however such studies have been restricted to voids with radii of 10 - 30 mpc .",
    "the scales of the large voids we are considering lie in the linear regime where the variance of the hubble contrast is directly related to the matter power spectrum @xmath46 .",
    "it has been noted ( using results from @xcite ) that above 100 mpc linear theory predictions agree well with n - body simulation results , although on smaller scales the hubble contrast is underestimated due to non - linear effects @xcite .",
    "applying linear theory and using the measured cmb dipole velocity , @xcite obtained the model - independent result @xmath47 in a sphere of radius @xmath48 .",
    "( this ought to be an acceptable procedure up to scales of order 800 @xmath49  mpc  on larger scales , relativistic corrections become increasingly important . ) in this paper we update these results by determining the probability distribution of @xmath50 and the density contrast on various scales using constraints on @xmath46 from wmap 5-year data @xcite and the sdss galaxy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we find that even the ` minimal local void ' is _ extremely _ unlikely if the primordial density perturbation is indeed gaussian as is usually assumed and the other ltb model voids even less so .",
    "however by the same token , the isw effect due to the voids seen in the sdss lrg survey @xcite appears to be too strong .",
    "moreover , observed large - scale peculiar velocities appear to be much higher than expected @xcite .",
    "it would appear that the standard model of structure formation itself needs reexamination hence the existence of a large local void can not be dismissed on these grounds .",
    "we study variations of the hubble parameter in the context of two different cosmological models , both of which fit the wmap and sdss data but have different amounts of power on spatial scales of @xmath51 mpc .",
    "the intention is to examine whether previous conclusions concerning the magnitude of such variations @xcite can be circumvented in an unorthodox model .",
    "our first model is the standard @xmath0cdm concordance model with a power - law primordial power spectrum .",
    "the spectral index and amplitude @xmath52 of the comoving curvature perturbation spectrum are evaluated at a pivot point of @xmath53 .",
    "the second model is dubbed the ` chdm bump model ' since it has both cold and hot dark matter and a ` bump ' in the primordial spectrum .",
    "it was developed by us @xcite based upon the supergravity multiple inflation scenario in which ` flat direction ' fields undergo gauge symmetry - breaking phase transitions during inflation triggered by the fall in temperature @xcite .",
    "each flat direction @xmath54 has a gravitational strength coupling to the inflaton @xmath55 , giving a contribution to the potential of the form @xmath56 .",
    "the flat directions are lifted by supergravity corrections and non - renormalisable superpotential terms .",
    "thus when a phase transition occurs the flat direction evolves rapidly from the origin where it was trapped by thermal effects to the global minimum of the potential .",
    "each phase transition changes the effective inflaton mass from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "since the primordial power spectrum is very sensitive to the inflaton mass this can introduce features into the spectrum .",
    "we showed that two flat directions @xmath59 and @xmath60 which cause successive phase transitions about 2 e - folds apart and create a small bump in the power spectrum centred on @xmath61 , allow an e - des model with @xmath39 to fit the wmap data @xcite .",
    "the effective scalar potential is : @xmath62 here @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the times at which the first and second phase transitions begin , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the couplings between @xmath55 and the flat directions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the co - efficients of the non - renormalisable terms of order @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a constant which dominates the potential . in the slow - roll approximation",
    "the height of the bump is @xmath72 , and the amplitude of the primordial perturbation spectrum to the left and right of the bump is @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , where @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the initial value of @xmath55 and @xmath77 are the fractional changes in the inflaton mass - squared due to the phase transitions .",
    "the bump lies approximately between the wavenumbers @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath67 and @xmath68 equal to unity , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 throughout as in our earlier work @xcite . in fitting to the wmap-5 data we also consider continuous ( non - integral ) values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 to determine whether a different shape of the ` bump ' gives a better fit , keeping in mind that its physical origin may be different from multiple inflation @xcite .    a pure cold dark matter ( cdm ) model exhibits excessive galaxy clustering on small scales .",
    "therefore it is necessary to include a hot dark matter ( hdm ) component which suppresses structure formation below the free - streaming scale .",
    "we obtain a good match to the shape of the sdss galaxy power spectrum with 3 neutrino species of mass @xmath20 ev .",
    "hence the chdm bump model has @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "we fit to the wmap 5-year @xcite temperature - temperature ( tt ) , temperature - electric polarisation ( te ) , and electric - electric polarisation ( ee ) spectra . compared to the wmap-3 results ,",
    "the wmap-5 measurement of the tt spectrum is @xmath86 higher in the region of the acoustic peaks due to the revised beam transfer functions , and the third acoustic peak is determined more accurately .",
    "polarisation measurements are improved by the use of data from an additional waveband .",
    "we also fit the linear matter power spectrum @xmath87 to the measurement of the real space galaxy power spectrum @xmath88 in the sdss @xcite .",
    "the hubble contrast @xmath50 smoothed over a sphere of radius @xmath48 is @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the peculiar velocity field and @xmath91 is the ` top hat ' window function , @xmath92 using linear perturbation theory @xcite it can be shown that the variance of @xmath50 is related to the matter power spectrum as @xcite @xmath93 here the window function @xmath94 is @xmath95 and the dimensionless linear growth rate @xmath96 for a @xmath0cdm universe can be approximated by @xcite @xmath97    similarly , the variance of the density contrast @xmath98 in a sphere of radius @xmath48 is @xmath99 where the window function @xmath100 is the fourier transform of @xmath91 .",
    "the variance of the peculiar velocity is given by @xmath101    finally we also consider @xmath102 , the ratio of the matter density to the critical density as measured locally by an observer inside the void @xcite .",
    "the variance of the perturbation @xmath103 is then @xmath104 where @xmath105.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we use the monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) approach to cosmological parameter estimation , which is a method for drawing samples from the posterior distribution @xmath106 of the cosmological parameters @xmath107 , given the data . for a discussion of the mcmc likelihood analysis see appendix b of @xcite . given @xmath108",
    "samples @xmath109 the best estimate for the distribution is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the dirac delta function . the cmb angular power spectrum and the matter power spectrum ( corrected for non - linear evolution using the ` halofit ' @xcite procedure ) of each model",
    "are calculated using a modified version of the camb cosmological boltzmann code @xcite following the approach of @xcite .",
    "while the temperature of the cmb monopole would be affected if we are located near the centre of a spherically symmetric void , secondary anisotropies due to the void are expected to decay rapidly for higher multipoles @xcite .",
    "we therefore neglect the possible effects of the void on the angular power spectra since these are important only at low multipoles where the cosmic variance is large .",
    "the integrals for the variances in eqs.([var1 ] , [ var2]-[var4 ] ) were evaluated numerically .",
    "care was taken to ensure the precise values of the integration limits did not affect the results .",
    "we compute @xmath96 numerically using the grow@xmath112 software package @xcite .",
    "we use a version of the cosmomc package @xcite modified to include @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 for 8 values of @xmath48 as additional derived parameters determined from the base monte carlo parameters .",
    "it follows from eq.([mcmc1 ] ) that 1-d marginalised distributions of these quantities for each @xmath48 value are obtained by plotting histograms of the samples .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath117 of @xmath50 on the scale @xmath48 given the data can be written as @xmath118 using eq.([mcmc1 ] ) this is approximated by @xmath119 where @xmath120 we calculate the probability distribution @xmath121 in same way .",
    "flat priors are used on the parameters listed in table [ tab : priors ] . here",
    "@xmath122 is the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance to last scattering ( multiplied by 100 ) , @xmath123 is the optical depth ( due to reionisation ) to the last scattering surface , and @xmath124 is the fraction of dark matter in the form of neutrinos , where the total dark matter density is @xmath125 .",
    "we assume the chains have converged when the gelman - rubin ` r ' statistic falls below 1.02 .",
    "we evaluate the sum in eq.([sum ] ) when post - processing the chains .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     this conclusion is strengthened by the recent detection of very large peculiar velocities on large scales . as seen in fig.[var ] , the expected variance of the peculiar velocity as calculated by eq.([var3 ] ) is about 200 km  s@xmath126 on a scale of 100 @xmath49 mpc , whereas the measured value is at least 5 times higher , and the discrepancy is even bigger on larger scales up to 300 mpc @xcite .",
    "it is also seen from fig.[prob1 ] that if a determination of the hubble constant is required with say 1% accuracy , then measurements extending out to at least @xmath127 must be made to overcome local fluctuations .",
    "a similar estimate was made by @xcite who noted that the observed variance in measurements of @xmath29 is in accord , thus consistent with the assumption of a gaussian density field .",
    "however the voids observed in the sdss lrg survey @xcite call this assumption into question . in particular whether there is a large local void is then an issue that must be addressed observationally and not dismissed on the grounds that it is inconsistent with gaussian perturbations . the hubble flow is presently poorly measured in the redshift range @xmath128  just where the effects of such a local void would be most apparent @xcite .",
    "given that dark energy may well be an artifact of such a void , this issue needs urgent attention .",
    "the question of how such voids can have been generated without conflicting with the cmb observations is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "some suggestions have been made in the context of multi - field inflationary models @xcite .",

    "<S> measurements of the sne  ia hubble diagram which suggest that the universe is accelerating due to the effect of dark energy may be biased because we are located in a 200 - 300 mpc underdense ` void ' which is expanding 20 - 30% faster than the average rate . with the smaller global hubble parameter </S>",
    "<S> , the wmap-5 data on cosmic microwave background anisotropies can be fitted without requiring dark energy if there is some excess power in the spectrum of primordial perturbations on 100  mpc scales . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss data on galaxy clustering can also be fitted if there is a small component of hot dark matter in the form of 0.5 ev mass neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we show however that if the primordial fluctuations are gaussian , the expected variance of the hubble parameter and the matter density are far too small to allow such a large local void . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless many such large voids have been identified in the sdss lrg survey in a search for the late - isw effect due to dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the observed cmb temperature decrements imply that they are nearly empty , thus these real voids too are in gross conflict with the concordance @xmath0cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> the recently observed high peculiar velocity flow presents another challenge for the model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore whether a large local void actually exists must be tested through observations and can not be dismissed _ a priori_.    [ firstpage ]    cosmic microwave background , cosmological parameters , cosmology : theory , dark matter , large - scale structure of universe </S>"
