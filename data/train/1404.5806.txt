    "observation of oscillations in solar spicules may be used as an indirect evidence of energy transport from the photosphere towards the corona . transverse motion of spicule axis can be observed by both , spectroscopic and imaging observations .",
    "the periodic doppler shift of spectral lines have been observed from ground based coronagraphs @xcite . but",
    "doppler shift oscillations with period of @xmath6 min also have been observed on the solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) by @xcite .",
    "direct periodic displacement of spicule axes have been found by imaging observations on solar optical telescope ( sot ) on _ hinode _ @xcite .",
    "the observed transverse oscillations of spicule axes were interpreted by kink @xcite and alfvn @xcite waves .",
    "all spicule oscillations events are summarized in a recent review by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the observed oscillation periods can be formally divided in two groups : those with shorter periods ( @xmath7 min ) and those with longer periods ( @xmath8 min ) @xcite . the most frequently observed oscillations lie in the period ranges of @xmath9@xmath10 min and @xmath11@xmath12 s. additionally , very long spicules , called as macrospicules by @xcite with a typical length of up to 40 mm",
    "are frequently observed mostly near the polar regions as reported by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one of the most important functions of coronal seismology is determining the period ratio @xmath13 between the period @xmath14 of the fundamental mode and the period @xmath15 of its first harmonic @xcite .",
    "different factors such as the effect of density stratification @xcite and magnetic twist @xcite can cause the deviation of the period ratio from its canonical value of @xmath5 . the observed values of this ratio in coronal loops is either smaller or larger than @xmath5 @xcite . @xcite using simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution h@xmath16 observations studied the oscillations in the relative intensity to explore the possibility of sausage oscillations in the chromospheric cool post - flare loop .",
    "they used the standard wavelet tool , and find @xmath17 .",
    "they suggested that the oscillations represent the fundamental and the first harmonics of the fast - sausage waves in the cool post - flare loop . @xcite",
    "have detected interesting phenomenon of simultaneous existence of fundamental and first harmonics of fast - kink oscillations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the ratio between the periods of fundamental and first harmonics @xmath13 was significantly shifted from @xmath5 , which later was explained as a result of longitudinal density stratification in the loop .",
    "the rate of the shift allows us to estimate the density scale height in coronal loops , which can be a few times larger compared to its hydrostatic value .",
    "observed oscillation periods can be used to estimate the alfvn speed and consequently magnetic field strength in macro - spicules @xcite .    the mentioned studies in the previous paragraph are all devoted to the coronal loop transversal oscillations .",
    "to my knowledge there is no any work related to the period ratio of spicules oscillations .",
    "so , the present study is an attempt to check this ratio observationally",
    ". we will study the same problem theoretically in our future works .",
    "sumer is a high - resolution normal incidence spectrograph operating in the range 666 - 1610**@xmath18** ( first order ) and 333 - 805**@xmath18** ( second order ) .",

    "the rectangular shows the region of south limb macro - spicules .",
    "we used the `` madmax '' algorithm to enhance the finest structures @xcite .",
    "as it is clear from down panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , the length of the studied spicule is @xmath21 mm which means that the studied spicule is macro - spicule . since the eit images have a fixed pixel resolution of @xmath22 arcsec so , the down panel of figure  [ fig1 ] is the best quality after image processing techniques .    ,",

    "we performed the radiometric calibration , so the specific intensity unit is w m@xmath23 sr@xmath24 @xmath24 through this analysis@xcite .",
    "we calculated the integrated intensity for o@xmath0 ( 1031.93 @xmath1 ) line along the sumer slit .",

    "we analyze o@xmath0 ( 1031.93 @xmath1 ) and o@xmath0 ( 1037.61 @xmath1 ) line profiles from the time series by fitting to a gaussian .",
    "then we calculated doppler shifts and consequently doppler velocities @xcite .",
    "we used the two stable photospheric neutral oxygen emission lines ( i.e. o@xmath28 ( 1027.43 @xmath1 ) and o@xmath28 ( 1028.16 @xmath1 ) ) that happen to be in the same spectral window with the o@xmath0 lines .",
    "doppler velocities and proper wavelet analysis results are presented in figures  [ fig4 ] ,  [ fig5 ] , and  [ fig6 ] for o@xmath0 ( 1031.93 @xmath1 ) .",
    "we perform wavelet analysis with morlet wavelet transform in three heights for both lines . on the other hand ,",
    "wavelet analysis results for the line o@xmath0 ( 1037.61 @xmath1 ) are showed in figures  [ fig7 ] ,  [ fig8 ] , and  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the wavelet power spectrum , the cone of influence , and the global wavelet power spectrum are plotted in each figure . the contour levels are chosen so that @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 of the wavelet power is above each level , respectively .    we determined the fundamental mode and its first harmonic periods for each line and in three heights ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 from the limb ) . for comparison we presented results in table 1 for both lines .",
    ".@xmath14(fundamental mode period ) , @xmath15(first harmonic period ) , and @xmath13 ( fundamental to its first harmonic period ratio ) are presented for both oxygen lines . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is clear from the table 1 , the fundamental mode and its first harmonic period ratios have departures from its canonical value of @xmath5 .",
    "they are greater than @xmath5 in both lines in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 from the limb .",
    "the fundamental mode periods are determined as @xmath33 s and its first harmonic periods are lied in the range @xmath34 s. these periods are in good agreement with the results of previous works in this area @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these periods and their ratios are related to a unique macro - spicule . it is shown in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "that the sumer slit covers only one macro - spicule .",
    "the density stratification and magnetic twist are two main factors which make the period ratio departures from its canonical value of @xmath5 .",
    "these two factors are studied in spicules both observationally and theoretically .",
    "the first estimation of spicule magnetic field by spicule seismology was done by @xcite .",
    "@xcite based on sot/_hinode _ observations determined the variation of magnetic field strength and plasma density along a spicule by seismology .",
    "they studied a kink wave propagating along a spicule by estimating the spatial change in phase speed and velocity amplitude as a novel approach .",
    "@xcite by using the sot/_hinode _ observations reported twisted motions in spicules .    since we determined the oscillation periods of fundamental mode and its first harmonic in macro - spicules , it is possible to estimate the alfvn speed and consequently magnetic field strength through them .",
    "kink waves are transverse oscillations of magnetic tubes and the phase speed for a straight homogenous tube can be written as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the alfvn speed inside the tube , @xmath37 is the wavelength , and @xmath38 is the observed oscillation period . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the plasma density outside and inside of tube , respectively . the density in spicules is @xmath41 kg m@xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite . for the fundamental mode , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the length of the macro - spicule which determined as @xmath21 mm in this work ) .",
    "the mean fundamental mode period is determined as @xmath46 s. by using these parameters in equation  [ eq : phasespeed ] the alfvn speed and magnetic field strength is estimated as @xmath47 km / s and @xmath48 g in macro - spicules , respectively .",
    "we analyze the time series of o@xmath0 ( 1031.93 @xmath1 ) and o@xmath0 ( 1037.61 @xmath1 ) line profiles obtained from sumer / soho in order to uncover the oscillations in the solar macro - spicules .",
    "we concentrate on particular coronal hole region which contains the macro - spicules and found that their axis undergo quasi - periodic transverse displacement .",
    "this is done by calculating doppler shifts and consequently doppler velocities in three heights @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 from the limb . by performing wavelet analysis with morlet wavelet",
    "transform in three heights we determine the fundamental mode and its first harmonic periods and their ratios .",
    "our findings show small departures of this value from its canonical value of @xmath5 in both lines and three mentioned heights .",
    "in other words , they are greater than @xmath5 in both lines in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 from the limb",
    ". these departures may be caused by the density stratification and magnetic twist which is observed in spicules .",
    "observed oscillation periods are used to estimate the alfvn speed and consequently magnetic field strength in macro - spicules as @xmath47 km / s and @xmath48 g , respectively .",
