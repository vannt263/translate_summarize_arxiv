    "in @xcite , the authors inspired by the effective bandwidth theory have developed a dual effective capacity theory to analyze random and time - varying wireless channel under a probabilistic delay constraint .",
    "the so - called _ effective capacity _ provides a way to figure out the maximal constant arrival rate that can be sustained by the stationary ergodic service process , at the target quality of service ( qos ) exponent .",
    "the authors in @xcite claim that the method given in @xcite can not be applied to general channel models such as time - correlated rayleigh fading , and it is only parametrized with respect to the so - called qos exponent .",
    "hence , they provide an alternate method of calculating the effective capacity which only involves the mean and variance of the cumulative service process .",
    "we analytically show that the effective capacity calculated by the method in @xcite is wrong .",
    "furthermore , we numerically demonstrate that even when the proposed method is used as an approximation to the actual effective capacity , the approximation is only valid under certain channel conditions and for small values of qos exponent .",
    "for stationary ergodic arrival and service process , the queue - overflow probability is shown to be asymptotically decaying with exponential rate @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the queue length at stationary state , and @xmath2 is called the _ qos exponent_. the smaller @xmath2 is , the looser qos guarantee achieves , which is reflected in the slower decay rate .",
    "on the contrary , faster decay rate with larger @xmath2 guarantees stringent qos performance .",
    "let @xmath3 be the instantaneous service rate of the queue in terms of bits that can be served in a finite length slot @xmath4 , and @xmath5 be the maximum aggregate number of bits that can be served during @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "wu and negi developed the concept of effective capacity @xcite , which is defined as the function of gartner - ellis ( ge ) limit of service process and the qos exponent @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ge limit of the service process .",
    "ge limit of service process is defined in terms of the logarithm of moment generating function of cumulative service process @xmath10 . @xmath11 .",
    "\\label{eq : alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in section iii of @xcite , the authors claim that regardless of the distribution of instantaneous service process , @xmath3 , the effective capacity , @xmath12 , is that of a gaussian random variable with mean and variance depending on the service process .",
    "we analytically show that in general this is not true , since the authors made a mistake while taking the ge limit of the cumulative service process .    for ease of exposition , we follow @xcite , and develop our arguments for the case of uncorrelated wireless channel , where @xmath13 , are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables . for this case , ge limit of service process can be found from as follows : @xmath14,\\nonumber\\\\      & =   \\lim_{t \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{t } \\log \\mathbb{e}\\left[e^ { \\theta \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{t } c(\\tau ) } \\right ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\      & =   \\lim_{t \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{t } \\log \\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\prod_{\\tau=0}^{t } e^{\\theta c(\\tau ) } \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\      & =   \\lim_{t \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{t } \\log \\left(\\prod_{\\tau=0}^{t } \\mathbb{e}\\left[e^{\\theta c(\\tau ) } \\right ] \\right ) , \\label{eq : alpha - uncorrelated}\\\\      & = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{t } \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{t } \\log \\mathbb{e}\\left[e^{\\theta c(\\tau ) } \\right ] , \\label{eq : alpha - correct }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where is obtained from the assumption that @xmath15 is iid .",
    "note that shows that ge limit of cumulative service process is simply the limit of the sum of logarithm of moment generating function of the instantaneous service process @xmath15 .    on the contrary , soret et .",
    "al . , states in section iii of @xcite that as @xmath16 central limit theorem can be applied , and @xmath10 can be considered as a gaussian random variable with average @xmath17 and variance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 $ ] , and @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "note that the moment generating function of this gaussian random variable is given as @xmath21 . even though , this argument is correct on its own , the derivation of effective capacity based on this argument appears flawed .",
    "soret et .",
    "al . , give the logarithm of moment generating function of cumulative service process which is found to be a gaussian random variable as : @xmath22 clearly , and are not equal to each other for all instantaneous service processes @xmath15 , even when @xmath16 .",
    "we demonstrate this with a simple example in the following section .    the problem with the argument made by soret et .",
    "is that the authors first take the limit of @xmath10 which is not only inside both the logarithm and expectation but also appears in the exponent of euler s number .",
    "in addition , after moving the limit to the exponent of euler s number , they still take the limit of moment generating function of gaussian random variable divided by @xmath23 . in summary , is the result of the following mathematical statement : @xmath24 \\nonumber\\\\      & =   \\lim_{t_2 \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{t_2 } \\log \\mathbb{e}\\left[e^{\\theta \\lim_{t_1 \\to \\infty } \\sum_{\\tau=0}^{t_1 } c(\\tau)}\\right ]    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , @xmath9 and @xmath25 are not equal to each other for all @xmath2 , and @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , a straightforward observation shows that these two quantities are equal to each other only when instantaneous service process @xmath15 is iid gaussian random variable with mean @xmath26 and variance @xmath27 .",
    "one may argue that even if @xmath9 and @xmath25 are not exactly equal to each other , @xmath25 represents a good approximation to @xmath9 whose derivation is quite complex for a large variety of wireless channels . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate that this is in fact not true , and the quality of approximation relies on the channel parameters as well . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a _ time - correlated _ and slotted channel model , namely on - off channel .",
    "the main reason we consider on - off channel model is that it is analytically sufficiently simple so that exact closed form solution of @xmath9 can be obtained .",
    "meanwhile , on - off channel still displays time - correlation among channel states similar to more complicated channel models such as rayleigh channels .",
    "note that the authors in @xcite argue that their approach is applicable not only to rayleigh channel model but also to all other possibly correlated channel models . by assuming on - off channel model , we can explicitly and inarguably show that their method provides a good approximation to exact effective capacity under a limited range of qos exponent @xmath2 , and channel rates .    on - off channel",
    "is modeled as follows . in on state , the user can send @xmath28 bits / slot , and in off state the user is not allowed to transmit any bits . the transition probability from off(on)-state to on(off)-state",
    "is denoted by @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , where @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to determine that the stationary probability of being in on - state is given as @xmath32 .",
    "ge limit of markov modulated process is found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the transition probability matrix for an irreducible and aperiodic general @xmath34-state markov modulated process , and let @xmath35 be the service rate of each state @xmath36 .",
    "then , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a diagonal matrix of service rates and @xmath39 is the spectral radius of matrix @xmath40 . for on - off source simplifies to @xmath41 where @xmath42 note that effective capacity of on - off channel can be determined by inserting into .",
    "meanwhile , in order to calculate @xmath25 , we first need to calculate the mean and the variance of cumulative service process .",
    "soret et .",
    "al . , states that over a block of length @xmath43 is chosen to be sufficiently long to ensure that elements of different blocks can be considered approximately independent .",
    "] , the mean and variance of cumulative service process is given as @xmath44&=km_c,\\nonumber\\\\ \\mbox{var}\\left(c(k)\\right ) & = k\\sigma_c^2 + 2\\sum_{p=0}^{k-2}\\sum_{q = p+1}^{k-1 } k_c(q - p),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45-m_c^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for on - off process described earlier , @xmath46=&r^2\\pi_{on}\\frac{1-\\mu+(1-\\lambda)(\\lambda+\\mu-1)^m}{2-\\lambda-\\mu}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the method given in @xcite , @xmath25 can be determined as @xmath47    we compare effective capacity calculated with @xmath9 and @xmath25 with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath28 .",
    "the state transition probabilities of on - off source are arbitrarily chosen as @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "note that we achieved similar results for other values of @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . in figure",
    "[ fig : theta ] , we observe that effective capacity calculated with @xmath9 and @xmath25 match well when the range of @xmath2 is in @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "however , one can easily notice that these two lines deviate from each other as @xmath2 increases .",
    "when @xmath2 is larger , i.e. , qos guarantees are stricter , then @xmath25 gives incorrect negative effective capacity values .            in figure",
    "[ fig : r ] , we compare the effective capacities with @xmath9 and @xmath25 for varying values of transmission rate @xmath28 .",
    "again , we clearly observe that the approximation given in @xcite is only correct for small values of @xmath28 .",
    "in this work , we analytically show that in @xcite the authors make a major flaw in finding the effective capacity by first applying the central limit theorem to the sum of iid random variables @xmath3 with mean @xmath26 and variance @xmath27 , and then taking the ge limit of the resulting cumulative random process .",
    "next , over a correlated on - off channel we numerically verify that @xmath25 is not a good approximation to @xmath9 either , since the quality of approximation depends to a great degree on the channel parameters .",
    "besides , given the channel parameters the proposed effective capacity expression of @xcite tends to follow the exact solution only in a limited range for qos exponent @xmath2 and negative capacity values are achievable as seen in figure [ fig : theta ] .",
    "the same observation is also true for the transmission rate @xmath28 as shown in figure [ fig : r ] .",
    "based on these observations , we caution the researchers on the applicability of the approach in @xcite , and recommend them to verify that the channel and qos parameters are chosen so that the approximation is correct .",
