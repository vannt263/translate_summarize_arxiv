    "hierarchical assembly is the established leading theory for the evolution of structure in the universe from the viewpoint of cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory .",
    "this states that larger structures form from the merging of smaller structures .",
    "thus cdm halos grow in size , with the largest structures forming latest in the history of the universe .",
    "galaxies are often thought to form principally in line with halo mergers .",
    "if they do , it is likely that merging of smaller galaxies to create more massive ones is the major factor in the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time .",
    "alternatives to a merger history of massive galaxies include rapid collapse mechanisms , whereby galaxies form over very short time - scales in the early universe , and then do not significantly merge during the rest of their lifetime .",
    "the aim of this paper is to address the question : what mechanism drives galaxy evolution with regards to the most massive ( @xmath0 ) galaxies in the universe ? we can observationally test this by calculating the merger fraction of massive galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "previous work by conselice et al .",
    "( 2007 ) explores this problem for similar mass galaxies out to z @xmath7 1.4 , using morphological techniques .",
    "we extend this work using a close - pair method to z @xmath7 3 , using data from the goods nicmos survey .",
    "there are several different ways to locate merging galaxies which roughly relate to the stage of the merger .",
    "the most direct method is to look at morphological disturbances in galaxies , e.g. conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 and 2008 ) . in this approach",
    "one selects galaxies with asymmetries , or distortions in their morphologies , above a certain threshold , and define these as merging systems .",
    "this can be carried out by eye , or via computational methods , e.g. cas , gini and @xmath14 parameters ( see conselice 2003 , 2006 , conselice at al . 2008 and lotz et al .",
    "alternatively , one could also look in principle for secondary features such as an abrupt increase in star formation rate .",
    "this is because the merging of gas rich galaxies will often give rise to an increase in star formation , and hence a distinctive spectral signature , see e.g. lin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and mathis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "also one can look for galaxies in close proximity and count the number of galaxies in apparent pairs in a given sample .",
    "this pair counting method requires much less angular resolution than the morphological approaches , and can be extended to higher redshift more directly than the others .",
    "the close pair method does not precisely trace merging , however , but rather looks for likely potential future mergers .",
    "thus , to go from a close pair fraction to a merger fraction requires that assumptions be made . ultimately , the pair count method measures mergers before they happen , the morphological approach measures merging while it happens , and methods involving increased star formation rates trace merging during and after the event .",
    "merging is already known to be of paramount importance in driving the rate of star formation , the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes , and as a mechanism for increasing galaxy mass .",
    "further , mergers can be used to trace the formation history of galaxies , probing where , when , and how galaxies form .",

    "( 2008 ) find that massive galaxies ( @xmath0 ) out to z @xmath7 1.5 have an increasing merger fraction with redshift .",
    "it has been noted for lower mass systems that there is a levelling off and eventual turn around in the merger fraction at @xmath15 ( see conselice et al .",
    "2008 ) . in order to probe whether the same levelling off and turn around in the merger fraction occurs for @xmath0 galaxies , it is necessary to explore the merger fraction of these massive galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "consequently , we have collated a sample of 82 galaxies with @xmath0 , selected from the goods north and goods south fields .",
    "these are imaged as part of the goods nicmos survey ( gns ) .",
    "the goods field has the multiband coverage needed to estimate good photomentric redshifts , in addition the depth and angular resolution from nicmos allows us to resolve significantly fainter objects around the primary targets to distances of a few kpc .",
    "thus , for the first time , we can probe the pair fraction history to z @xmath7 3 .",
    "we argue that the increase in merger fraction with redshift continues for massive galaxies in our sample out to z @xmath7 3 .",
    "the merger fraction shows no sign of levelling off or turning around at @xmath16 , unlike for lower mass systems observed by conselice et al .",

    "the goods nicmos survey imaged a total of @xmath7 8000 galaxies in the f160w ( h ) band , utilising 180 orbits and 60 pointings of the hst nicmos-3 camera .",

    "a total of 82 galaxies were found with @xmath0 , with photometric and spectroscopic redshifts between z = 1.7 and z = 3 . limiting magnitudes reached are h = 26.5 ( 10@xmath21 ) .",
    "there is a wealth of observational data covering the goods field . as such , the masses and photometric redshifts of our sample of massive galaxies are calculated using data from the u - band to the h - band ( e.g. giavalisco et al .",
    "the stellar masses were measured utilising standard multi - colour stellar population fitting techniques , producing uncertainties of @xmath7 0.2 dex .",
    "the details of this procedure can be found in , e.g. bundy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and conselice et al .",
    "the stellar masses were calculated assuming a chabrier initial mass function and by producing model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) constructed by bruzel & charlot ( 2003 ) via stellar population synthesis models parametrised by an exponentially declining star formation history .",
    "the model seds are then fit to the observed seds of each galaxy to obtain a stellar mass .",
    "recent work by conroy , gunn and white ( 2008 ) , however , has suggested that current methods for measuring stellar masses may have greater errors than previously thought ( @xmath7 0.3 dex ) .",
    "although newer methods have been developed utilising different stellar evolution tracks , we find that these newer models do not significantly affect our measured stellar masses , and our stellar masses are accurate to within a factor of a few . for a discussion of this see trujillo et al .",

    "we found that @xmath22 of lower mass galaxies systematically infiltrated our higher mass sample .",
    "this effect is relatively small and will not significantly affect our results .",
    "moreover , since we go on to note a dramatic increase in the pair fraction of massive galaxies , when compared to less massive ones , this effect can not be responsible because contamination of lower mass systems would result in the pair fraction of higher mass galaxies being lower ( see e.g. conselice et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "our photometric redshifts are determined via standard techniques ( e.g. conselice et al .",
    "2008 ) . these contain additional uncertainty on top of the stellar mass issues .",

    "using the goods / vimos dr1 ( see popesso et al .",

    "we use sextractor to make catalogs for all detected galaxies in the gns , removing stars and spurious detections .",
    "we then carefully check by eye that the deblending is accurate and that we are not artificially merging separate galaxies or splitting individual galaxies into parts . for the massive galaxies studied in this paper , we put in particular effort to ensure that the sources are extracted accurately .",
    "further , the choice of studying major mergers with mass ratios of at least 1:4 of the primary source ( + /-",

    "we follow an approach similar to patton et al . ( 2000 ) for calculating major merger fractions for our galaxies based on the pair method .",
    "first we separate our galaxies into two redshift bins , with @xmath25 for the first group ( containing 44 galaxies ) and @xmath26 for the second group ( containing 38 galaxies ) .",
    "the method for assigning potential pairs is relatively straightforward .",

    "this would be an accurate pair fraction if we had precise redshifts for all of the galaxies in our sample , and included in the summation only those at the same redshift as the host .",
    "as we have redshifts only for our host galaxies , we do not know if any particular galaxy within 30 kpc is a real pair or just foreground or background contamination .",
    "we correct for contamination by calculating the probability of a close galaxy being a pair by chance from our surface number counts .",
    "these number counts are taken around the objects to minimise clustering effects .",

    "this gives an expectation value for the number of galaxies one would expect to see within 30 kpc of the host galaxy purely by chance .",
    "although massive galaxies at high redshifts are highly clustered , our correction is based upon the densities of objects centred around these systems .",
    "this value is then subtracted from the number counts to obtain a major pair fraction thus :    @xmath31    where n is the total number of galaxies in the summation .",

    "this is because both morphological and close pair methods likely trace merging but have different timescales .",
    "a detailed investigation on the differing timescales traced by morphological and pair methods in conselice , yang & bluck ( 2008 ) suggests that the timescale for 30 kpc pairs and morphologically selected mergers is very close .",

    "the resultant final error on the merger rate is very large .",

    "<S> we calculate the major pair fraction and derive the major merger fraction and rate for 82 massive ( @xmath0 ) galaxies at @xmath1 utilising deep hst nicmos data taken in the goods north and south fields . for the first time , </S>",
    "<S> our nicmos data provides imaging with sufficient angular resolution and depth to collate a sufficiently large sample of massive galaxies at z @xmath2 1.5 to reliably measure their pair fraction history . </S>",

    "<S> 0.4 . we go on to fit a theoretically motivated press - schechter curve to this data . </S>",
    "<S> this press - schechter fit , and the data , show no sign of levelling off or turning over , implying that the merger fraction of massive galaxies continues to rise with redshift out to z @xmath7 3 . </S>",
    "<S> since previous work has established that the merger fraction for lower mass galaxies turns over at z @xmath7 1.5 - 2.0 , this is evidence that higher mass galaxies experience more mergers earlier than their lower mass counterparts , i.e. a galaxy assembly downsizing . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate a merger rate at z = 2.6 of @xmath8 @xmath9 5 @xmath10 10@xmath11 gpc@xmath12 gyr@xmath13 , which experiences no significant change to @xmath8 @xmath9 1.2 @xmath10 10@xmath11 gpc@xmath12 gyr@xmath13 at z = 0.5 . </S>",
