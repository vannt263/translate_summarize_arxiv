    "the study of quantized vortices @xcite in superfluid helium ( he  ii ) and of quantum turbulence @xcite has been held back over the years by the difficulty of flow visualization near absolute zero .",
    "fortunately the problem has been recognized , and new visualization techniques have become recently available .",
    "one of the most promising technique is based on trapping small micron - size tracer particles ( made of glass , polymers or solid hydrogen ) onto quantized vortices  @xcite .",
    "the use of tracer particles has made possible , for example , to study velocity statistics  @xcite in superfluid turbulence and to visualize  @xcite individual reconnections of quantized vortices , a process which is crucial in the dynamics of turbulence  @xcite .",
    "to interpret these recent experiments it is necessary to understand the interaction of the tracer particles with the quantized vortices  @xcite . in particular , we need to find in which measure the tracer particles disturb the vortices , hence change the flow which one tries to visualize .",
    "clearly , on one hand a large number of tracers improves the images and the signal to analyze , but on the other hand too many tracers must affect the motion of vortices in a significant way .",
    "what is the maximum density of tracers which can be used ?    to answer this practical question , we introduce a quantitive measure of the tracers disturbance , which we call the superfluid stokes number . after deriving and solving the governing equations , we determine by what amount the motion of a quantized vortex ring of radius @xmath0 is disturbed by the presence of @xmath1 tracer particles of radius @xmath2 trapped into the vortex core . by interpreting @xmath0 as the typical local radius of curvature @xmath3 of the filaments ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the vortex line density ) , we apply the result to a recent experiment in which quantum turbulence was visualized .",
    "consider a quantized vortex ring of radius @xmath0 which moves in the @xmath6 direction in superfluid helium at temperature @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath1 small buoyant tracer particles of mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath2 are trapped in the vortex core . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the vortex ring remains axisymmetric during the evolution and that the particles remain trapped in it .",
    "let @xmath9 be cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the vortex position and velocity are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is time , and a dot denotes a time derivative . let the circulation vector be @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and let @xmath17 be the unit vector tangent to the ring in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "the forces acting on the vortex ring are the magnus force @xmath19 , the friction force @xmath20 with the normal fluid , and the stokes force @xmath21 induced by the tracer particles .",
    "the magnus force is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 @xmath24 is the superfluid density , @xmath25 is the total superfluid velocity at the vortex line , @xmath26 is the self  induced velocity of the ring at @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , \\label{eq : vi}\\ ] ] @xmath29 is the vortex core radius , and @xmath30 is an externally applied superflow , which for the sake of simplicity we assume in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the friction force @xmath20 arises from the interaction of phonons and rotons ( which make up the normal fluid ) with the vortex core ; we write @xmath31 , where the friction per unit length is @xmath32 , \\label{eq : drag}\\ ] ] and @xmath33 is an externally applied normal fluid velocity , which again we assume to be in the @xmath6 direction . the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 are dimensionless temperature  dependent friction coefficients related to the friction coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 calculated by barenghi , donnelly & vinen @xcite by @xmath38    note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be expressed in terms of the more used friction coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xcite @xmath41 ^ 2 + b^2 \\rho_n^2/(4 \\rho^2)},\\ ] ] @xmath42 } { [ 1-b'\\rho_n/(2 \\rho)]^2 + b^2 \\rho_n^2/(4 \\rho^2)}.\\ ] ]    if @xmath1 spherical particles of mass @xmath43 each , where @xmath44 is the particle density , are attached to the vortex ring , the ring has total mass @xmath45 and experiences the stokes force @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the normal fluid kinematic viscosity , @xmath48 is the viscosity , and @xmath49 is the normal fluid density .",
    "this simple linear stokes drag is appropriate because the reynolds number based on the particle size is extremely small . for the sake of simplicity and to make contact with some experiments  @xcite we assume that the particles are buoyant , i.e. they have density @xmath50 , hence there is no archimedes force .    the equations of motion of the vortex ring are thus @xmath51    the resulting equations for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are : @xmath56   -\\frac{1}{\\tau}u,\\\\   { \\dot{v}}=cr [ - ( 1- \\gamma_0 ' ) u + \\gamma_0 ( v_n - v ) ] + \\frac{1}{\\tau}(v_n - v ) , \\label{eq : motion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 the quantity @xmath58 is the stokes relaxation time of the particles .    it is convenient to rewrite the equations of motion in dimensionless form .",
    "we choose the initial radius @xmath59 as the unit of length , and @xmath60 as the unit of speed ; the unit of time is thus @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath14 , @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are now dimensionless .",
    "the dimensionless quantities @xmath71 and @xmath72 are defined as @xmath73    the above dimensionless form of the equations of motion allows us to compare the motion of a vortex ring with @xmath1 tracers against the motion of a bare vortex ring ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "if we further set @xmath80 we obtain @xmath81 which means that , as expected , the ring shrinks ( @xmath82 ) and speeds up , transferring its kinetic energy to the stationary background normal fluid .",
    "if we further set @xmath27 we obtain the expected stationary solution @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "we choose values of parameters which are relevant to typical experiments ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) and solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1])-([eq:4 ] ) numerically using the adams - bashforth method . in all calculations",
    "we take @xmath80 for simplicity .",
    "the initial conditions are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bare - u ] ) and ( [ eq : bare - v ] ) . during the evolution",
    "the vortex ring shrinks .",
    "clearly , when a significant fraction of the circumference of the ring is covered by tracers , our model breaks down , as there is not enough vortex length to provide the correct induced velocity @xmath68 . since we are not interested in this last stage of the evolution , we arbitrarily stop our calculations when the tracer particles cover one third of the circumference , that is , when the dimensionless ring s radius becomes smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig1 ] compares the evolution of the dimensionless radius @xmath52 of vortex rings with @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 trapped tracer particles to the decay of a bare vortex ring ( @xmath74 , solid curve labeled `` a '' ) , computed solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bare - u ] ) and ( [ eq : bare - v ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that the more particles are trapped ( hence the larger @xmath71 and @xmath72 are ) , the faster the decay of the ring is compared to the decay of a bare ring .",
    "[ fig2 ] plots the corresponding time dependence of the radial velocity component @xmath93",
    ". initially the ring shrinks at constant rate , then the radius decreases faster and faster .    the axial velocity component @xmath94 is shown in fig .",
    "initially @xmath67 remains similar to the velocity of the bare ring ; during the final part of the evolution a vortex ring with tracers moves much faster than a bare vortex ring , because , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the radius has become much smaller .",
    "the results described above suggest that the evolution of vortex rings which contain tracers is sufficiently similar to the evolution of a bare vortex ring , provided that the ring is not too small and that it does not contain too many tracers .",
    "the important question is how to quantify the perturbation which the tracers induce on the the ring s evolution so that one can decide whether the visualization with tracers affects or not the evolution of vortices . to answer this question we start by remarking that the ring s decay is caused by both friction and stokes forces ; going back to dimensional variables",
    ", we note that the ratio of the magnitudes of these forces is @xmath95 we call @xmath96 the superfluid stokes number . in the absence of external forcing ( @xmath80 ) the superfluid stokes number decreases during the evolution , starting from the initial value @xmath97 at @xmath98 , because @xmath0 decreases with time .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath96 corresponding to figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is apparent that if @xmath99 the evolution of a vortex ring with tracers is very similar to that of a bare vortex ring , but if @xmath96 becomes of order unity or larger then the tracers affect the ring s motion significantly .    to put in evidence the temperature dependence of the superfluid stokes number , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the distance between tracers along the circumference of the ring in units of tracer size , and @xmath102 is a strongly temperature dependent prefactor . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that @xmath103 is approximately constant for temperatures below @xmath104 but it increases sharply above @xmath105 .",
    "this means that , for the same geometry ( ring s radius and number of tracers along the ring ) , the superfluid stokes number is bigger for @xmath106 , hence the motion of vortex rings is much more disturbed by the presence of tracer particles than shown for example in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] .",
    "isotropic homogeneous quantum turbulence is characterized by the vortex line density @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the total vortex length and @xmath109 is the volume . in the first approximation",
    "this form of turbulence can be generated by applying a heat flux @xcite . from the value of @xmath5 one",
    "infers that the average vortex separation and the typical radius of curvature are of the order of @xmath110 . in a recent experiment",
    "@xcite , solid hydrogen particles were used to visualize such turbulence : some tracers moved along the normal fluid in the direction of the heat flux , and other tracers were trapped on the quantized vortices as the vortex tangle drifted in the opposite direction . at @xmath111",
    "the turbulence generated by the heat flux @xmath112 corresponds to approximately  @xcite @xmath113 .",
    "the hydrogen volume fraction used in the experiment was @xmath114 .",
    "generalizing from a vortex ring of length @xmath115 to a vortex tangle of length @xmath116 and using @xmath117 , the superfluid stokes number can be estimated as @xmath118 where @xmath119 . if one tenth of the tracers are trapped inside vortices , using @xmath120 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) we obtain @xmath121 . we conclude that in this particular experiment the tracers have not disturbed the dynamics of the vortex tangle .",
    "we have derived the equations of motion of a vortex ring which contains @xmath1 buoyant tracer particles trapped on the vortex core .",
    "we have shown typical solutions of these equations to illustrate the difference between the motion of a bare , undisturbed vortex ring , and that of a vortex ring which is visualized by tracer particles .",
    "a first approximate measure of the disturbance caused by trapped particles is the geometrical quantity @xmath122 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) , the separation between tracers along the ring in unit of tracer s size .",
    "clearly @xmath122 must be small for tracers not to disturb the vortex .",
    "a more precise measure is the superfluid stokes number @xmath123 , where the dimensionless temperature dependent quantity @xmath103 is approximately constant for @xmath124 but becomes very large for @xmath106 .    finally , we have shown how this criterion is relevant to quantum turbulence , and can be used to determine the maximum hydrogen volume factor which can be used to visualize the turbulent flow without disturbing it .",
    "we have applied the criterion to a recent experiment  @xcite in which the drift of vortex lines generated by a heat flux was measured and found that the disturbance was negligible .",
    "it would be interesting to apply the same criterion to experiments in which vortex reconnections were detected @xcite : this case is more challenging , as during the reconnection process much smaller values of the radius of curvature are expected to arise which may be disturbed by tracer particles .",
