    "the equilibrium properties of a statistical - physical system are often characterized by a few macroscopic degrees of freedom . as the system gets out of equilibrium ,",
    "however , a huge , mostly unmanageable number of degrees of freedom come into play .",
    "for this reason , most conventional approaches to nonequilibrium physics have recourse to the linear - response approximation , where the response of the system to a small perturbation is expressed in terms of equilibrium properties .",
    "the possibility of an exact formalism incorporating nonequilibrium processes has recently emerged with the discovery of the so - called fluctuation theorems  @xcite and the formulation of steady - state thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "popular study cases of collective nonequilibrium dynamics are provided by classical spin models , such as the kinetic glauber - ising model  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the earlier literature , where the dynamical phase transitions in such low dimensional stylized systems have been investigated at depth  @xcite , we focus here on a different aspect of the problem , namely on the search for an algebraic framework to characterize a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) . this class of systems can be maintained out of equilibrium by a variety of external agents , like multiple heat reservoirs  @xcite or external time - dependent magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "for instance , when a weak , slowly oscillating magnetic field is applied to the glauber - ising model , the system eventually enters a steady collective oscillation phase via entrainment .",
    "the linear - response theory accurately describes the onset of entrainment by adopting the average magnetization as an order parameter  @xcite .",
    "however , we show below that such a perturbation approach fails to determine the probability density function ( pdf ) itself or other observables that are nonlinear functions of the pdf , like the entropy .",
    "the approach pursued in this work is opposite to the linear - response theory : instead of restricting ourselves to the low - frequency regime , where the magnetic field oscillates with a period much longer than the spin - flip time scale , here we assume from the beginning a high - frequency regime , where the driving frequency and the spin - flip rate are comparable .",
    "we show that , even if this situation occurs far from equilibrium , there exists a rather simple relationship between the ness for the driven spin system , and the known boltzmann equilibrium pdf for the system subject to a constant magnetic field .",
    "this result can be then extended to analyze more realistic situations for lower driving frequency . in this first report , we focus on globally coupled spin systems , whose critical behavior belongs to the mean - field ( mf ) universality class . in view of practical applications",
    ", we remind that this is the universality class of three - dimensional quantum ising ferromagnets and uniaxial dipolar ising ferromagnets  @xcite .",
