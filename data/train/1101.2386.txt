    "one of the most promising candidates for quantum computation is the implementation using spin systems as quantum bits ( qubits ) @xcite .",
    "combining with nanostructure technology , they have the potential advantage of being scalable to a large system . in particular",
    ", the spin in a quantum dot exhibits a relatively long coherence time compared with fast gate operation times .",
    "this makes it a good candidate for a quantum information carrier @xcite .",
    "however the influence of the environment , especially the spin environment , on a spin , which usually causes the decoherence of the spin , is inevitable .",
    "typically , the material environment must be present in order to host the spin or to locally control the electric or magnetic fields experienced by the spin .",
    "therefore the decoherence behavior of a central spin or several spins interacting with a spin bath has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "the problem of a central spin coupled to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin environment was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these investigations , a pure dephasing model in which the self - hamiltonian of the undriven central spin commutes with the interaction hamiltonian to the environment was considered .",
    "a similar problem of a spin-@xmath0 impurity embedded in an af environment was studied in the context of quantum frustration of decoherence in ref .",
    "there the impurity spin is coupled locally in real space to just one spin of the af environment , in contrast to the central spin model @xcite where the central spin is coupled isotropically with equal strength to all the spins of the environment . in this paper , we consider a more general case of a central spin ( qubit ) driven by an external field and coupled to an af spin bath ( environment ) .",
    "to control the quantum states of a qubit , some types of time - dependent controllable manipulations , which can be electrical @xcite , optical @xcite , or magnetic @xcite , are desirable .",
    "thus it is important and necessary to study the behavior of a qubit ( central spin ) or several qubits ( spins ) interacting with an environment ( a spin bath ) in the presence of a driving field @xcite .",
    "recently , the coherent dynamics of a single central spin ( a nitrogen - vacancy center ) coupled to a bath of spins ( nitrogen impurities ) in diamond was studied experimentally @xcite . to realize the manipulation of the central spin , the pulsed radio - frequency radiation was used . under the control of a time - dependent magnetic field , ref .",
    "@xcite considered a central spin system coupled to a spin bath .",
    "the decay of rabi oscillations and the loss of entanglement were discussed .",
    "however , the correlations between spins in the spin bath were neglected .",
    "recent investigations indicated that the internal dynamics of the spin bath could be crucial to the decoherence of the central spin @xcite . in our driven spin model ,",
    "the interactions between constituent spins of the af environment are taken into account .",
    "the self - hamiltonian of the central spin , after a transformation to a frame rotating with the frequency of the driving field , can be written in a form of @xmath1 in the rotating wave approximation .",
    "due to the additional driving term of @xmath2 that provides energy into the system and does not commute with the interaction hamiltonian that couples to the af environment in our model , the dynamics of the central spin in this case is dramatically different from the undriven pure dephasing behaviors investigated in refs .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the form and the rate of rabi oscillation decay are useful in experimentally determining the intrabath coupling strength for a broad class of solid - state systems @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in our problem .",
    "after the use of the spin - wave approximation to deal with the af environment , we employed an elegant mathematic technique to trace over the af environmental degrees of freedom exactly to obtain the reduced density matrix of the driven spin .",
    "this enables us to study and describe the decay behaviors of the rabi oscillations for different initial states and parameters of the central spin - af environment model beyond the markovian approximation and born approximation ( perturbation ) . with the reduced density matrix obtained nonperturbatively",
    ", we also investigate and discuss the decoherence and the pointer states of the central spin from the perspective of the von neumann entropy .",
    "we find that the decoherence behavior of the central spin depends on the detuning , driving strength , the coupling between the central spin and the spin environment , and an important factor @xmath3 , associated with the number of the spins , the lattice structure and the temperature of the environment .",
    "if the detuning exists , the rabi oscillations may show a behavior of collapses and revivals ; however , if the detuning is zero , such a behavior will not appear .",
    "we investigate the weighted frequency distribution of the time evolution of the central spin inversion and give this phenomenon a reasonable explanation . the form and",
    "the rate of rabi oscillation decay is useful in determining the intrabath coupling strength and other related properties of the qubit - environment system @xcite .",
    "although we concentrate on the central spin model , our study is applicable to similar models of a pseudo spin or a qubit coupled to an environment .",
    "for example , in the study of the decoherence behavior of a flux qubit interacting with a spin environment , the same self - hamiltonian of the qubit , @xmath1 , can be used @xcite . in such case",
    ", @xmath4 is the bias energy and @xmath5 is tunnel splitting of the flux qubit , and the two eigenstates of @xmath6 correspond to macroscopically distinct states that have a clockwise or an anticlockwise circulating current @xcite which can be denoted as @xmath7 or @xmath8 . to make contact of the driven central spin model with experiments",
    ", one may envisage a setup of a small ring - shaped flux qubit located at a distance above or below an also ring - shaped af material that has a common symmetric z - axis with the flux qubit .",
    "in this case , the coupling strength between the flux qubit and each of the constituent spins of the af material ( environment ) may be regarded to be almost the same .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the model hamiltonian is introduced and the spin wave approximation is applied to map the spin operators of the af environment to bosonic operators . after tracing over the environmental modes ,",
    "the reduced density matrix is obtained and the dynamics of the central spin is calculated .",
    "we also investigate the decoherence and the pointer states of the central spin for the cases of zero detuning and nonzero detuning , and calculate the von neumann entropy which is a measure of the purity of the mixed state .",

    "this suggests that the eigenstates @xmath187 and @xmath188 are dynamically selected by the environment as the preferred pointer states in the self - hamiltonian dominant regime .",
    "moreover , when the energy parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 of the self - hamiltonian of the central spin system are increased further with respect to the system - bath coupling strength @xmath131",
    "( i.e. , the self - hamiltonian dominates even more ) , the values of entropy evolution are lower ( the green dashed curve is lower than the pink dot - dashed curve in the zero - detuning case , and the blue dotted curve that is close to zero is lower than the red solid curve in the detuning case ) as shown in fig .  [",

    "this confirms furthermore again that in the regime where the self - hamiltonian of the system dominates ( with or without detuning ) , the eigenstates of the system self - hamiltonian emerge as the preferred pointer states .",
    "we investigate the decoherence of a qubit in an af environment , in the presence of a driving field .",
    "the difficulty of our problem lies in the fact that the self - hamiltonian does not commute with the interaction hamiltonian and the internal dynamics ( coupling ) of the spin bath are taken into consideration at the same time .",
    "the spin - wave approximation is used to map the spin operators of the af environment onto bosonic operators in the low - temperature and low - excitation limit .",
    "then the resultant model is solved exactly , even in the case of multi - environment modes and finite environment temperatures .",
    "our approach includes the environment dynamics , the qubit dynamics , and the quantum correlations between them .",
    "the influence of the af environment on the qubit is found to depend on two factors , i.e. , the coupling constant @xmath131 and a dimensionless factor @xmath199 .",
    "increasing the two factors , the decay time of the rabi oscillations becomes shorter , the decoherence of the qubit is enhanced , and the qubit state becomes more mixed with time .",
    "the time evolution of the rabi oscillations also depends on the detuning between the driving frequency and the qubit larmor frequency .",
    "if the detuning exists , the rabi oscillations may show a behavior of collapses and revivals ; however , if the detuning is zero , such a behavior will not appears .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the weighted frequency distribution investigated here .",
    "also the decoherence and the pointer states of the qubit are discussed from the perspective of the von neumann entropy .",
    "it is found that the eigenstates of the qubit self - hamiltonian are dynamically selected by the environment as the preferred pointer states in the weak system - environment coupling limit ( or in the self - hamiltonian dominant regime ) .",
