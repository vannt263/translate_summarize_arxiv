    "in contrast to the standard heavy - fermion physics so far developed extensively in ce - based compounds , praseodymium ( and uranium ) materials have more exotic aspects inherent in a variety of their atomic states .",
    "nozires and blandin first argued this issue in view of kondo effect , and they categorized possible ground states ( fixed points ) in terms of the magnitude of spin @xmath3 and the number of scattering channels of conduction electrons @xmath4 as ( i ) the perfect screening ( @xmath5 ) , ( ii ) the underscreening ( @xmath6 ) , and ( iii ) the overscreening ( @xmath7 )  @xcite .    among them , the overscreening case results in the nfl phenomena , and extensive investigations on this subject have been performed .",
    "for instance , the temperature dependences of the specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , and resistivity for @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 and the residual entropy is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the kondo temperature for the two - channel kondo exchange model  @xcite , and @xmath13 is the residual resistivity . in the last decade , the lattice version of the two - channel kondo problem has also been studied theoretically  @xcite , in particular , it is found by means of the so - called dynamical mean - field theory that it exhibits a variety of long - range orderings  @xcite , and analytic expressions of @xmath14 dependence are obtained such as @xmath15 in the @xmath16 expansion with vertex corrections  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 is the characteristic temperature of the two - channel kondo lattice model , which differs from the single - site counterpart @xmath12 in general .",
    "a practical situation to realize the overscreening was proposed by cox  @xcite . in his model for ube@xmath18",
    ", the quadrupole moment in the non - kramers doublet plays a role of pseudospin ( @xmath9 ) , which is to be screened by the quadrupole moment of conduction electrons with real spins , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as two equivalent scattering channels ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "hence , it is called the quadrupole kondo effect . in the uranium ion ,",
    "@xmath21 electron is moderately localized and the crystalline - electric - field ( cef ) splitting is often too broad to identify it .",
    "this aspect has hampered clear understanding of such exotic kondo effect .",
    "on the contrary , @xmath22 electron in the pr ion is well localized exhibiting clear cef splitting . moreover ,",
    "a cage - like structure such as the filled skutterudites provides many number of ligands for f electrons , which effectively increases hybridization strength to conduction electrons  @xcite .",
    "such a situation offers ideal playground to explore the exotic kondo problem and resultant anomalous electronic states .",
    "recently , a series of prt@xmath1x@xmath2 compounds , having a cage - like structure as well , has been found as non - kramers doublet system , which meets criteria for the quadrupole kondo effect .",
    "in fact , prv@xmath1al@xmath2 , prir@xmath1zn@xmath2 and prrh@xmath1zn@xmath2 exhibit nfl behaviors in the resistivity , specific heat and so on above the quadrupole ordering  @xcite . they even coexist with superconductivity  @xcite . on the contrary , prti@xmath1al@xmath2 shows ordinary fl behavior at ambient pressure  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a simple construction of the extended two - channel kondo exchange model with non - kramers doublet cef ground state under cubic symmetry does not possess any fl fixed points  @xcite , although the model without cef splitting must apparently have fl fixed point .    in this paper",
    ", we construct yet another extended two - channel kondo exchange model , which represents the competition between nfl and fl .",
    "these two fixed points differ in the occupation of two f electrons onto @xmath23 orbitals , and hence the orbital fluctuation must be important in the vicinity of the boundary between these two fixed points .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the extended two - channel kondo exchange model and discuss the limiting cases . in  3 , we exhibit results obtained by wilson s nrg method .",
    "we discuss the distinct electronic states and their parameter dependence in the characteristic temperatures .",
    "the magnetic - field effect is also discussed . in the last section",
    ", we discuss relevance of our results to recent experiments in prt@xmath1x@xmath2 systems , and summarize the paper .",
    "with an odd number of f - electron valency , localized cef states are subject to the kramers theorem , which states that at least double degeneracy must remain due to time - reversal symmetry . on the contrary ,",
    "systems with an even number of f electrons are free from this theorem , and a degeneracy should come from different symmetry reason other than the time reversal , or may be accidental .",
    "for example , the total angular momentum @xmath25 multiplet of @xmath24 configuration is lifted into @xmath26 singlet , @xmath27 doublet , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 triplets under cubic symmetry . among them",
    ", @xmath27 doublet carries no magnetic moments , and it has @xmath30-type and @xmath31-type electric quadrupoles , in addition to @xmath32-type magnetic octupole .",
    "the wavefunctions of these cef states are complicated and rather depend on whether the @xmath33 coupling ( russell - saunders ) or the @xmath0-@xmath0 coupling scheme is used .",
    "nevertheless , essential feature of the states can be understood in a simplified version of the @xmath0-@xmath0 coupling picture as follows .",
    "more precise expressions of the wavefunctions in the @xmath0-@xmath0 coupling scheme can be found in the literature  @xcite .    in the @xmath0-@xmath0 coupling scheme ,",
    "the @xmath24 states are described by filling up two electrons into @xmath23 cef states , which are @xmath34 doublet , and @xmath35 quartet under cubic symmetry .",
    "the three kramers pairs ( labelled by the orbital indices , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) constitute @xmath34 and @xmath35 states , and the latter is degenerate due to cubic symmetry .",
    "we neglect the energy splitting between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for simplicity .",
    "then , the non - kramers @xmath27 states can be regarded as two singlet states of @xmath34-@xmath39 and @xmath34-@xmath40 , while the two magnetic triplet states , @xmath28 , @xmath29 correspond to two triplets among @xmath34-@xmath35 .",
    "we should note that in these states , one f electron always occupies @xmath34 and another stays in either @xmath39 or @xmath40 state .",
    "the remaining @xmath26 singlet is identified as the double - occupied state within @xmath34 state .",
    "the role of the orbital degeneracy is apparent in the above construction of the @xmath24 cef states , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "we have neglected the doubly occupied states in each @xmath23 orbital such as fig .",
    "[ f2cef](d ) due to large intra coulomb repulsion , and the splitting between @xmath28 and @xmath29 excited states , for simplicity .",

    "[ f2cef](e ) .",
    "when the hybridization @xmath46 between the f and corresponding partial wave of conduction electrons is switched on , magnetic and orbital exchange processes appear in the second order of @xmath47 . in terms of the pauli matrices , @xmath48 , acting on the (",
    "a , b ) orbital space , the orbital operator for f electrons is given by @xmath49 then , the two exchange processes are expressed as @xmath50+k\\bigl[\\bm{t}_{\\uparrow}(0)+\\bm{t}_{\\downarrow}(0)\\bigr]\\cdot\\bm{t}_{f},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the spin and orbital operators of the conduction electrons at the impurity site . here , @xmath53 couples equally with two orbital degrees of freedom , @xmath52 ( @xmath54 and @xmath20 channels ) , which is ensured by the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the second term is the origin of the overscreening kondo effect of quadrupole degrees of freedom as will be shown shortly .",
    "since the origins of two exchange processes are the same hybridization @xmath47 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are expected to be the same order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the energy difference between @xmath24 and @xmath59 states .",
    "in contrast to @xmath23 systems such as ce - based compounds where magnetic kondo effect usually dominates , the hybridization leads to both magnetic and quadrupole kondo effects , especially in the non - kramers doublet systems with suitable magnetic excited states under cubic symmetry .",
    "therefore , an interesting competition between @xmath55 and @xmath56 terms could be expected in those systems .",
    "we will ignore the hybridization among @xmath34 as a first step .",
    "eventually , the hamiltonian of the extended two - channel kondo model to be investigated in this paper reads @xmath60      let us consider two opposite limits of the model .",
    "first , we consider the case where the excited cef states can be neglected , or @xmath61 . within the @xmath27 doublet denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65",

    "<S> we discuss possible competition between magnetic and quadrupole kondo effects in non - kramers doublet systems under cubic symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole kondo effect leads to non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) ground state , while the magnetic one favors ordinary fermi liquid ( fl ) . in terms of the @xmath0-@xmath0 coupling scheme , </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the orbital fluctuation must develop in the vicinity of the nfl - fl boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a change of behavior in the f - electron entropy by the wilson s numerical renormalization - group ( nrg ) method on the basis of the extended two - channel kondo exchange model . </S>",
    "<S> we present implications to extensively investigated prt@xmath1x@xmath2 ( t = ti , v , ir ; x = al , zn ) systems that exhibit both quadrupole ordering and peculiar superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the magnetic - field effect which lifts weakly the non - kramers degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> our model also represents the fl state accompanied by a free magnetic spin as a consequence of stronger competition between the magnetic and the quadrupole kondo effects . </S>"
