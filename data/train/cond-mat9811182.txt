    "since the pioneering work of bohm and pines@xcite , the conduction electrons in a metal have been described as a three - dimensional ( 3d ) gas of electrons in a neutralizing uniform positive charge . the dynamical linear density - response function of a 3d electron gas ( 3deg ) was evaluated by lindhard@xcite in the so - called random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , in which each electron is assumed to move in the external field plus the induced field of all electrons .",
    "the wave - vector and frequency dependent dynamical quadratic density - response function of a 3deg has also been evaluated@xcite , by going beyond linear response theory .",
    "the knowledge of this quantity has been proved to be of great importance in discussing the properties of electrons in a variety of 3d systems@xcite , and , in particular , in explaining the experimentally observed difference between the electronic energy losses of protons and antiprotons moving through a solid@xcite .",
    "the suggested existence of two - dimensional electron layers in metal - insulator - semiconductor structures and on the surface of liquid helium led several years ago to a great activity in the study of a two - dimensional electron gas@xcite , where the electrons are confined to a plane and neutralized by an inert uniform rigid positive plane background .",
    "the 2d electron system has also been considered in discussing the physics of new - class materials such as copper - oxide planes of high - temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "it has been found that electrons confined to a 2d layer show sometimes interesting properties not shared by a 3d electron system .",
    "for instance , for a 2d metal the plasma frequency goes to zero in the long - wavelength limit , in contrast to the 3d situation@xcite .",
    "stern@xcite evaluated the dynamical linear density - response function of a 2deg in the rpa , and calculated the plasmon dispersion and the asymptotic screened coulomb potential .",
    "also , much effort has gone into studying the ground state energy@xcite and the excitation spectrum of a 2deg@xcite .",
    "the stopping power for a fast particle moving parallel to a 2deg was first evaluated in the rpa , within linear response theory , by horing _",
    "et al_@xcite , and the effect on this quantity of finite temperature@xcite , local field corrections@xcite and recoil@xcite has also been considered .",
    "nonlinear calculations of the stopping power for slow protons and antiprotons have been performed only very recently@xcite on the basis of a scattering theory approach , the scattering cross sections being calculated for a statically screened potential .    in this paper we present results for the dynamical quadratic electronic density - response of a 2deg to longitudinal external fields of arbitrary wave - vector and frequency , which we evaluate on the same level of approximation as the rpa linear density - response function of stern@xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate the usefulness of the knowledge of this quantity , we consider , as an example , the stopping power of a 2deg , and we use the quadratic density - response function to evaluate the @xmath0 nonlinear correction to the stopping power of a 2deg for particles of charge @xmath2 moving at a fixed distance from the 2d plasma .",

    "higher order corrections become important , and for @xmath98 , @xmath86 contributions ( dashed line ) are smaller than the @xmath0 correction , indicating that the external potential can not be treated , for these electron densities , as a small perturbation . in the case of a projectile moving at a given @xmath70 distance above the 2d plasma the external perturbation is obviously diminished and , in particular , for @xmath99 the quadratic stopping power is smaller than the linear one for all electron densities ( see the inset of fig .",

    "second , at velocities around the plasmon threshold velocity , for which the projectile has enough energy to excite a plasmon@xcite , the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath86 contributions to the stopping power increases , again in contrast to the 3d situation .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the increase of this ratio at the plasmon threshold velocity becomes dramatic as the electron density decreases .",
    "of course , the ratio between quadratic and linear contributions to the stopping power decreases very rapidly with @xmath70 ( see the inset of fig .",

    "4 ) ; also , the inclusion of short - range correlations , which are ignored in the rpa , is known to have a substantial effect on the plasmon dispersion@xcite .",
    "we interpret the anomalous enhancement of the ratio between quadratic and linear contributions to the stopping power at the plasmon threshold velocity and small electron densities ( @xmath104 ) as a result of neglecting , within the rpa , short - range correlations between the electrons of a 2d system , since these correlations are non - negligible for all values of @xmath70 as long as @xmath43 is not small .",

    "we have reproduced , in the high - density limit , previous full nonlinear calculations of the stopping power of a 2deg for slow antiprotons , and we have gone further to calculate the @xmath0 correction to the stopping power for a wide range of projectile velocities . we have found that the @xmath0 contribution to the stopping power of a 2deg presents properties not shared by the 3deg . on the one hand , the range of validity of the linear velocity dependence of the @xmath0 contribution to the stopping power persists only up to velocities much smaller than the fermi velocity , and , on the other hand , an anomalous enhancement of the ratio between quadratic and linear contributions to the stopping power at the plasmon threshold velocity is found , within the rpa , at small electron densities ( @xmath104 ) . also , our results indicate that linear response calculations are , for all projectile velocities , less reliable in 2d than in 3d .",

    "<S> the electronic response of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system represents a key quantity in discussing one - electron properties of electrons in semiconductor heterojunctions , on the surface of liquid helium and in copper - oxide planes of high - temperature superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we here report an evaluation of the wave - vector and frequency dependent dynamical quadratic density - response function of a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) , within a self - consistent field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we use this result to find the @xmath0 correction to the stopping power of a 2deg for charged particles moving at a fixed distance from the plane of the 2d sheet , @xmath1 being the projectile charge . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce , in the high - density limit , previous full nonlinear calculations of the stopping power of a 2deg for slow antiprotons , and we go further to calculate the @xmath0 correction to the stopping power of a 2deg for a wide range of projectile velocities . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that linear response calculations are , for all projectile velocities , less reliable in two dimensions than in three dimensions . </S>"
