    "lattice study of heavy quark physics is indispensable for determining the standard model parameters such as the quark masses and ckm matrix elements , and for finding signals of new physics beyond it .",
    "obtaining accurate results for heavy quark observables , however , is a non - trivial task . since lattice spacings of order @xmath11 currently accessible",
    "is comparable or even larger than the compton wavelength of heavy quark given by @xmath12 for charm and bottom , a naive lattice calculation with conventional fermion actions suffers from large uncontrolled systematic errors . for this reason , effective theory approaches for heavy quark",
    "have been pursued .",
    "one of the approaches is the lattice version of the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , which is applicable for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "since the expansion parameter of nrqcd is the quark velocity squared @xmath14 , lattice nrqcd works well for sufficiently heavy quark such as the the bottom ( @xmath15 ) , and the bottomonium spectrum @xcite and the @xmath16 hybrid spectrum @xcite have been studied successfully using lattice nrqcd .",
    "an serious constraint with the approach , however , is that the continuum limit can not be taken due to the condition @xmath13 . thus scaling violation from the gauge and light quark sectors",
    "should be sufficiently small . in practice",
    "it is often difficult to quantify the magnitude of systematic errors arising from this origin .",
    "another difficulty is that there are a number of parameters in the nrqcd action which have to be determined . since in the present calculations the tuning of parameters",
    "is made at the tree level ( or tadpole improved tree level ) of perturbation theory , the accuracy achieved is rather limited .",
    "another approach for heavy quark uses a space - time asymmetric quark action , aiming to implement the @xmath17 improvement for arbitrary quark mass @xcite . with appropriate parameter tunings , this action is unitarily equivalent to the nrqcd action up to higher order corrections for @xmath13 , and goes over into the light quark sheikholeslami - wohlert ( sw ) action @xcite for @xmath18 .",
    "this approach has been originally proposed by the fermilab group and the action is hence called the `` fermilab action '' , whose first application is found in @xcite . since the necessary tuning of mass - dependent parameters is in general difficult , in practice one uses the usual sw quark action even for @xmath13 , where the sw action is unitarily equivalent to nrqcd .",
    "this simplified approach , called the `` non - relativistic interpretation '' for the sw quark , has been widely used in current lattice simulations of heavy quark , such as the calculation of the @xmath19 meson decay constant @xcite . toward the continuum limit",
    "@xmath20 the lattice action approaches the usual @xmath17-improved action and the systematic error becomes smaller as @xmath21 .",
    "however , the @xmath22 dependence at @xmath23 is quite non - linear , and it is not trivial how the systematic error could be controlled .",
    "recently use of the anisotropic lattice for heavy quark simulations has been proposed @xcite as a possible alternative to solve the difficulties of the effective approach . on an anisotropic lattice , where the temporal lattice spacing @xmath24 is smaller than the spatial one @xmath5",
    ", one can achieve @xmath25 while keeping @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , using anisotropic lattices , one can reduce @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) discretization errors while the computer cost is much less than that needed for the isotropic lattice at the same @xmath24 .",
    "naively it is expected that the reduction of @xmath27 errors entails the reduction of most of discretization errors due to large quark mass , since the on - shell condition ensures that the large energy scale flows only into the temporal direction as far as one considers the static particle , _ with zero or small spatial momentum_. if such a naive expectation is correct , the discretization error is controlled by a small parameter @xmath29 as it is for light quarks , and one can achieve even better accuracy by taking a continuum limit .",
    "however , it is not obvious that one can eliminate all @xmath30 errors at the quantum level , even if it is possible at the tree level .",
    "another advantage of the anisotropic lattice , which is more practical , is that a finer temporal resolution allows us to determine large masses more accurately .",
    "this has been already demonstrated in simulations of the glueball @xcite and the hybrid meson @xcite .",
    "klassen calculated the charmonium spectrum in the quenched approximation , employing lattices with the ratio of the temporal and spatial lattice spacings @xmath31 and 3 , as a feasibility study of the anisotropic approach @xcite .",
    "he tuned the ratio of the temporal and spatial hopping parameters @xmath32 non - perturbatively by demanding the relativistic dispersion relation for mesons .",
    "for the spatial clover coefficient @xmath33 , he adopted two choices , the tree level tadpole improved value correct for any mass ( @xmath34 ) and that correct only in the massless ( @xmath35 ) limit , in order to make a comparison .",
    "he mainly studied the spin splitting of the spectrum , and obtained an unexpected result that two different choices of the clover coefficients lead to two different values of the s - state hyperfine splitting even in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "the continuum limit is of course unique , and clearly , at least one of the two continuum extrapolations is misleading . since the hyperfine splitting is sensitive to the clover coefficients , it is plausible that the disagreement is due to a large discretization error arising from the choice of the clover coefficients . in an unpublished paper @xcite , he pointed out the possibility that the @xmath36 errors still remain with his choice of the parameters , which we review in the next section .",
    "a similar statement can be found in some recent studies @xcite .",
    "in fact , he adopted rather coarse lattice spacings @xmath370.30 fm where @xmath26 .",
    "it is then questionable whether the reliable continuum extrapolation is performed at such coarse lattice spacings .    using the same anisotropic approach as klassen",
    ", chen has recently calculated the quenched charmonium spectrum @xcite .",
    "she employed @xmath38 and finer ( @xmath390.25 fm ) lattices , and adopted the tree level tadpole improved clover coefficient @xmath33 correct for any mass , which is expected to be better than the other choice that is correct only in the massless limit .",
    "she computed not only the ground state masses but also the first excited state masses , and extrapolated them to the continuum limit .",
    "her results at @xmath38 are consistent with klassen s results at @xmath38 and 3 with the same choice of the clover coefficients .",
    "since chen s calculation was performed only at @xmath38 , similar calculations at different values of @xmath40 using fine lattices are needed to check the reliability of the continuum limit from the anisotropic approach .",
    "in addition , the complete p - state fine structure has not yet obtained in this approach so far , since the mass of @xmath41 state has not been measured in previous studies .    in this work",
    ", we present a detailed study of the charmonium spectrum from the anisotropic lattice qcd .",
    "we perform simulations in the quenched approximation at @xmath42 , employing fine lattice spacings in the range @xmath430.2 fm .",
    "we attempt to determine the ground state masses of all the s- and p - states ( including @xmath44 ) as well as their first excited state masses . to estimate the systematic errors accurately , we adopt both the tree level tadpole improved value and non - perturbative one for @xmath6 , and both the pole mass and kinetic mass for @xmath45 which is tuned to the experimental value .",
    "we focus on the lattice spacing dependence and continuum limit of the mass splittings .",
    "we compare our results with the previous anisotropic results by klassen and chen to check the consistency , and with experimental values @xcite to estimate the quenching effect .",
    "in addition , to understand the discrepancy of the hyperfine splitting mentioned above , we make a leading order analysis using the potential model . to examine the effect of clover coefficients",

    "we also consider the tadpole improvement of bare parameters and see how tree level values are modified .      in this work ,",

    "<S> we then compute the charmonium spectrum in the quenched approximation employing @xmath3 anisotropic lattices . </S>",

    "<S> the clover coefficients @xmath1 are estimated from tree - level tadpole improvement . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for the ratio of the hopping parameters @xmath6 , we adopt both the tree - level tadpole - improved value and a non - perturbative one . </S>",
    "<S> the latter employs the condition that the speed of light calculated from the meson energy - momentum relation be unity . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the spectrum of s- and p - states and their excitations using both the pole and kinetic masses .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the combination of the pole mass and the tadpole - improved value of @xmath6 to yield the smoothest approach to the continuum limit , which we then adopt for the continuum extrapolation of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the results largely depend on the scale input even in the continuum limit , showing a quenching effect . </S>",
    "<S> when the lattice spacing is determined from the @xmath7 splitting , the deviation from the experimental value is estimated to be @xmath830% for the s - state hyperfine splitting and @xmath820% for the p - state fine structure . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with previous results at @xmath9 obtained by chen when the lattice spacing is determined from the sommer scale @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> we also address the problem with the hyperfine splitting that different choices of the clover coefficients lead to disagreeing results in the continuum limit . making a leading order analysis based on potential models </S>",
    "<S> we show that a large hyperfine splitting @xmath895 mev obtained by klassen with a different choice of the clover coefficients is likely an overestimate . </S>"
