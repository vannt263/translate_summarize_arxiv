    "grand unified theories @xcite with quark - lepton unification have often been used as key ingredients in attempts to understand the widely differing values of physical parameters describing particle interactions at low energies . in the context of susy guts",
    ", this approach can explain the experimentally measured values of the electro - weak mixing angle .",
    "the same models also lead to @xmath6 yukawa unification @xcite which seems to be in rough agreement with observation or even @xmath7 yukawa unification @xcite which agree with observation for large values of @xmath8 .",
    "it is then natural to explore whether there are other manifestations of quark lepton unification at low energies .    in a recent paper ,",
    "three of us @xcite discussed the possibility that weak interaction properties of quarks and leptons parameterized by very different flavor mixing matrices at low energies may become identical at high scales and provide another signature of quark  lepton unification .",
    "we found that if neutrinos are majorana fermions with quasi - degenerate masses and with same cp , it could indeed happen i.e. starting with the ckm mixing matrix for neutrinos at the gut - seesaw scale @xcite , as would be expected on the basis of quark  lepton unification @xcite , renormalization group evolution ( rge ) to the weak scale leads to predictions for neutrino mixings in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "since small angles become larger , we have called this phenomenon radiative magnification and the interesting result is that the rges give two large mixings in the solar and atmospheric neutrino sectors while ultra smallness of @xmath9 even after radiative magnification yields a small @xmath10 maintaining consistency with chooz - palo - verde observations @xcite .",
    "we then predicted @xmath11 which could be used to test the model @xcite .",
    "we called this `` high scale mixing unification '' ( hum ) hypothesis .",
    "the common mass of quasi - degenerate neutrinos required for hum to work is in the range @xmath12 ev @xmath13 ev .",
    "this falls in the appropriate range accessible to the currently planned experiments @xcite and overlaps with the values claimed by heidelberg - moscow @xmath14 experiment @xcite .",
    "it also overlaps the wmap bound @xcite and the range accessible to the katrin experiment @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the radiative magnification mechanism with high - scale mixing unification works only for reasonably large values of @xmath15 for which @xmath7 yukawa unification takes place .",
    "furthermore , the hum hypothesis provides an alternative way to understand the difficult problem of the diverse mixing patterns between quarks and leptons without relying on new mass textures for neutrinos or new family symmetries .",
    "this makes it interesting in its own right and in our opinion deserves further consideration .",
    "renormalization group effects on neutrino mass parameters over wide range of values have been discussed in a number of works using standard @xcite or nonstandard @xcite parameterizations of the pmns matrix ; but our present and earlier results @xcite are distinct in the following respects : ( 1 ) because of the underlying quark - lepton unification hypothesis , the input values of the three mixing angles are small at the gut - seesaw scale and are identical to the corresponding ckm mixings @xcite .",
    "the high scale input value of the dirac phase in the pmns matrix , which was set to zero in @xcite and discussed in subsequent sections is also identical to the corresponding quantity in the ckm matrix .",
    "( 2 ) the three light neutrinos are quasi - degenerate in mass .",
    "( 3 ) the rh majorana neutrino mass matrix is proportional to a unit matrix due to an @xmath16 @xcite symmetry , which leads to quasi - degenerate light neutrinos through the type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "( 4 ) the heavy degenerate masses of rh neutrinos being very close to the the gut - seesaw scale , large threshold corrections originating from non - degeneracy of rh neutrinos are absent in our case . in view of this , the model predictions are definite and can be tested more by planned neutrino experiments .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "only cp conserving case was considered in @xcite and all neutrino mass eigenstates were assumed to possess the same cp .",
    "clearly , understanding cp phases is an integral part of understanding the flavor puzzle @xcite and it is therefore important to explore whether the `` high scale mixing unification '' hypothesis throws any light on this . the purpose of the present paper is to investigate this question .",
    "following the hum hypothesis we identify the three mixing angles and the dirac phase of the pmns mixing matrix as those of the ckm mixing matrix at the gut - seesaw scale while keeping the two majorana phases as unknown . whether exact quark - lepton symmetry at high scale permits nonzero values of the majorana phases is a model dependent question",
    "; therefore , we consider two different cases : ( i ) when the high scale pmns matrix with zero majorana phases is identified with the ckm matrix ; and ( ii ) when the pmns matrix equals the product of the ckm matrix times a diagonal majorana phase matrix .",
    "the diagonal - phase matrix may originate from the seesaw contribution to the neutrino mass .",
    "we find that the radiative magnification of mixing angles are generally damped in the presence of majorana phases and the degree of damping depends upon the values of these parameters .",
    "however in spite of this , the model has enough parameter space to magnify the mixing angles to be in agreement with the low - energy neutrino data starting from the ckm matrix at the gut - seesaw scale ; in this case , we find that @xmath10 and leptonic cp - violations are large enough to be measurable in long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we also derive new analytic formulas for threshold corrections including majorana phases which are generally valid in all models with quasi - degenerate neutrino masses . out of a number of solutions which require  small threshold corrections to bring the solar neutrino",
    "mass squared difference in accord with experimental data as before , we find a new region in the parameter space where no such threshold corrections are necessary .",
    "we show how the the partial damping of magnification due to majorana phases is utilized to obtain this new class of solutions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss the new boundary condition at the gut seesaw scale and rges .",
    "in sec.iii we discuss input parameters at gut - seesaw scale and some general criteria including the role played by majorana phases in damping radiative magnification . in sec.iv",
    "we present new analytic formulas showing how majorana phases influence threshold corrections explicitly .",
    "solutions to the rges and predictions in different cases are presented in sec.v . in sec.vi",
    "we discuss the new class of solutions without threshold corrections using damping property of majorana phases . in sec.vii",
    "we summarize the results briefly and state our conclusions .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the assumption that there is an underlying gauge symmetry that unifies quarks and leptons and lead to the possibility that the ckm matrix for quarks and the pmns matrix are equal . in @xcite",
    ", we gave an example of this symmetry as @xmath17 times a discrete permutation family symmetry @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper , we do not discuss any specific model but rather assume that such a symmetry exists implying the mixing unification at the seesaw scale .",
    "given this hypothesis , the existence of the ckm phase would imply that the dirac phase of the pmns matrix at the gut scale is the ckm phase .",
    "as far as the two majorana phases of the pmns matrix are concerned , they have no counterparts in the ckm matrix .",
    "however , due to seesaw mechanism , it is not implausible that the majorana phases are also present at the high scale . we therefore study two possibilities : ( i ) setting the two majorana phases to zero at the gut - seesaw scale and examine the low energy behavior of the theory ; ( ii ) treating the two phases as unknown parameters and see their effect .    the boundary condition for mixing angles at the seesaw scale",
    "is therefore given by : + * @xmath18 : * u_pmns(m_r ) = v_ckm(m_r ) v_d(m_r ) [ eq1 ] where @xmath19 is the rg - extrapolated ckm matrix for quark mixings from low energy data including its experimental value for the dirac phase .",
    "the two unknown majorana phases are provided through the diagonal matrix @xmath20 .",
    "thus , up to the presence of the diagonal phase matrix in eq.(1 ) , this boundary condition establishes complete identity of the pmns mixing matrix for leptons with the ckm mixing for quarks at the gut - seesaw scale through the high scale mixing unification ( hum ) hypothesis . below the gut - seesaw scale",
    ", however , there could be substantial differences between the two due to rg evolution effects and we parameterize the pmns matrix as + * @xmath21 :* + u=.(e^i_1 , e^i_2 , 1 ) [ eq2 ]    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and all the mixing angles and phases are now scale dependent .",
    "we have chosen the majorana phases to be two times of that in usual parameterizations .",
    "this choice is made for the sake of convenience in computation .",
    "the values of the mixing angles at low energies will be obtained from rg evolution following the top - down approach under the boundary conditions ,    _",

    "we find here more convenient to use rges directly for the mass eigenvalues and mixing angles including phases derived in the mass basis @xcite .",
    "for the sake of rg solutions assume the three neutrino mass eigenvalues to be real and positive",
    ". the rges for the light neutrino mass eigenvalues can be written as    = -2f_(p_i + g_i)m_i - m_if_u,(i=1,2,3 ) [ eq4 ]    the rges for mixing angles and phases are represented upto a good approximation for small @xmath10 which is actually the case through the following equations @xcite ,    & = & , [ eq5 ] + & = & - , [ eq6 ] + & = & f_c_122_12s_23 ^ 2/,[eq7 ] + d&=&- + & & -2f _ , [ eq8 ] + d_1 & = & -2f_,[eq9 ] + d_2 & = & -2f_[eq10 ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , but g_1&=&-s_132_122_23 + s_13 ^ 2c_12 ^ 2c_23 ^ 2 , + g_2&=&s_132_122_23 + s_13 ^ 2s_12 ^ 2c_23 ^ 2 [ eq11 ]    in the case of mssm with @xmath31 ,    f_&=&-h_^2/(16 ^ 2 ^ 2 ) , + f_u&=&(1)(65g_1 ^ 2 + 6g_2 ^ 2- 6h_t^2 ^ 2),[eq12 ]    but , for @xmath32 ,    f_&=&3h_^2/ ( 32 ^ 2 ) , + f_u&=&(3g_2 ^ 2 - 2 - 6h_t^2 ) /(16",

    "in this section we discuss damping of radiative magnification caused by majorana phases . while providing guidelines for the choice of input parameters we also point out some general features of the solutions in the context of the high scale mixing unification model . throughout this paper all quantities with superscript zero indicate input parameters at the gut - seesaw scale @xmath33 gev .    for our calculation , we use the low energy data for the ckm matrix given by pdg @xcite and we take into account the appropriate renormalization corrections to obtain their values at the gut - seesaw scale . due to the dominance of the top quark yukawa coupling the one - loop renormalization corrections give @xcite , & = & |v^0_cb||v_cb| + & & exp0.83 [ eq15]while",

    "one point of utmost importance in this analysis is the nature of tuning needed in the neutrino mass eigenvalues which are inputs at the gut seesaw scale . for quasi - degenerate neutrino masses having a common mass @xmath36 , ( m_2 - m_1 ) = 2m_0 ,  ( m_3-m_2 ) = 2m_0 [ eq20]using the experimental data from solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , @xmath37 ev@xmath38 and @xmath39 ev@xmath38 yields , ( m_2 - m_1)(ev ) & = & 0.004 ,  0.0002 ,  0.0001 ,  0.00004 + ( m_3- m_2)(ev ) & = & 0.12 ,  0.006 ,  0.003 ,  0.0012 + m_0(ev ) & = & 0.01 ,  0.2 ,  0.4 ,  1.0 [ eq21 ]",
    "this clearly suggests that if we confine ourselves to values of neutrino masses to be accessible to ongoing beta decay and double beta decay processes i.e. @xmath40 ev , fitting the experimental data on @xmath41 requires tuning between @xmath42 and @xmath43 at least up to fourth place of decimals while fitting the data on @xmath44 needs tuning at least up to the third place of decimals between @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "the region of small common mass where the tuning improves by 1 - 2 orders is inaccessible to these experiments and also the rges do not succeed in achieving the desired magnification when @xmath46 ev .",
    "we again emphasize the point noted in @xcite that successful radiative magnification requires that @xmath47 ev .",
    "our idea can therefore be ruled out if there is no evidence for majorana neutrino mass in the next round of neutrino double beta decay searches @xcite as well as , of course , by the measurement of @xmath10 .",
    "it is known that rges of neutrino mixing angles exhibit quasi - fixed points at low energies and these predicted quasi - fixed points are not in agreement with the observed experimental data @xcite . exploiting the hum hypothesis we have shown @xcite that these quasi - fixed ponts can be avoided in supersymmetry throgh radiative magnification which is achieved by appropiate fine - tuning of quasi - degenerate neutrino mass eigen values and for larger values of @xmath15 .",
    "such type of fine - tuning has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a useful general property of the rges with quasi - degenerate neutrinos is the following scaling behavior : for a set of solutions with masses @xmath48 , mixings , phases , and mass squared differences @xmath49 , any other set of masses scaled to @xmath50 are also solutions with the same mixings and phases but with mass squared differences scaled to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the common scaling factor for all mass eigenvalues .",
    "this property serves as a useful tool to derive other allowed solutions from one set of judiciously chosen numerical solutions to the rges .    from the structure of eq.(5)-",
    "eq.(10 ) it is clear that for a set of solutions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , there exists another set of solutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the initial choice of input majorana phases @xmath57 continue to retain their values to low energies up to a good approximation .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite in the top down approach the rges for mass eigenvalues given in eq.(4 ) not only decrease the masses but they also decrease their differences such that at low energies @xmath58 . the radiative magnification of the three mixing angles takes place for quasi - degenerate neutrinos because of smallness of the mass differences @xmath59 that occurs  in the denominators of the rhs of rges for the mixing angles in eq.(5)- eq.(7 ) . for the same reason large changes",
    "are also expected in the phases . during the course of rg evolution in the top - down approach @xmath60 and the rate of magnification for mixing angles increases .",
    "equivalently the solar and atmospheric mass differences decrease from their values at @xmath18 to approach their experimental values at @xmath61 and the radiative magnification occurs for all the three mixing angles . while @xmath62 and @xmath63 attain their respective large values @xmath64 remains small at low energies in spite of its magnification because its high scale starting value derived from the quark sector is much smaller(@xmath65 ) .",
    "note that since the input values for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are small with much smaller values for @xmath69 , but @xmath70 , it is clear from the rhs of eq.(5 ) that initially substantial contribution to the rate of magnification of @xmath63 is caused by the dominant @xmath71 term , but @xmath72 term contributes only later during the course of evolution .",
    "the following considerations hold when both the majorana phases are small . in eq.(7 )",
    "the coefficient on the rhs is proportional to @xmath73 whose initial value is very small .",
    "therefore the magnification of @xmath62 requires very small difference between @xmath74 and @xmath75 compared to the difference @xmath76 . on the other hand the dominant term in the rhs of eq.(5 )",
    "is proportional to @xmath77 which is much larger near @xmath18 than the corresponding coefficient in eq.(7 ) .",
    "the basic reason for this is essentially the smallness of ckm mixings near the gut - seesaw scale which is totally different from the situations where initially there are large mixings @xcite .",
    "therefore in the hum model radiative magnification of @xmath63 can occur for larger mass difference between @xmath78 and @xmath74 compared to @xmath79 which is required for the magnification of @xmath62 through eq.(7 ) .    in the presence of finite values of majorana phases the situation undergoes a quantitative change even if the smallness conditions in the initial mass differences are satisfied . in general damping in the magnification of the mixing angles",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 sets in whenever @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , or @xmath84 occurring in eq.(5 ) and eq.(7 ) deviate from @xmath85 .",
    "to see the reason for magnification damping in a qualitative manner , note that the presence of majorana phases is equivalent to multiplying the mass of the neutrino by that phase ( i.e. @xmath86 ) .",
    "now recall the well known case where for @xmath87 corresponding to the case of opposite cp - parity of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , magnification of @xmath80 is prevented .",
    "similarly if @xmath90 , the cp - parity of @xmath91 is opposite to that of @xmath88 or @xmath89 and the mixing angle @xmath81 can not be magnified . in general values of @xmath92 different from @xmath93 or @xmath94",
    "cause damping to the magnification of mixings , the damping being stronger for negative values of cosine functions occurring in the rhs of eq.(5 ) and eq.(7 ) .",
    "but as we find in spite of such dampings radiative magnification of the mixing angles can still be realized if these cosines have positive values @xmath95 at lower scales .",
    "it is clear from eq.(5 ) that if @xmath96 the magnification of @xmath63 can not occur even though the smallness condition on the mass difference @xmath97 is satisfied . if @xmath98 this magnification is badly affected .",
    "in fact even if @xmath24 is small , but if @xmath99 the dominant magnifying term in eq.(5 ) would start decreasing and it would need still smaller value of the initial mass difference @xmath97 to achieve magnification . as a result this region of majorana phases would be restricted by the low energy data on @xmath100 since the latter is proportional to the mass difference @xmath101 .    from eq.(7 ) we see that no magnification can occur for @xmath62 if @xmath102 which can be satisfied for @xmath103 , @xmath104 or for @xmath105 , @xmath98 .",
    "eq.(5 ) and eq.(7 ) permit magnifications of @xmath63 and @xmath62 for small values of the majorana phases @xmath106 .",
    "also when @xmath107 is small , magnification is allowed for all values of @xmath108 except in the region @xmath109 where the magnification of the solar mixing angle is strongly damped out for similar choice of the mass difference @xmath110 for which magnification takes place in other cases .",
    "when @xmath111 , it is clear from eq.(8 ) that @xmath112 is directly proportional to @xmath113 and the rg solution for the leptonic dirac phase approaches @xmath114 as @xmath115 .",
    "a general consequence of the rges for the majorana phases is that if we start with the initial condition @xmath116 at the gut - seesaw scale , they would obtain equal values during the course of evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore if we start with vanishing majorana phases at the gut - seesaw scale they continue to remain zero at low energies .    even though certain input values of majorana phases might appear to be affecting magnification of mixings at high scales , their role to cause damping becomes different at lower scales as the supplied phases change by rg evolution .",
    "particularly the damping becomes most severe for the choice @xmath117 since these phases which damp out magnification of both the mixing angles to start with remain almost unaltered during the course of evolution .",
    "although certain choices of input values of majorana phases can cause partial or total damping of magnification of mixing angles , moderate damping with other choices can be utilised to obtain smaller mass squared differences at low energies .",
    "exploiting this mechanism we show in sec.vi how we identify a region in parameter space where @xmath118 needs no threshold corrections to be in agreement with the experimental data . on the other hand with mssm spectrum below the gut - seesaw scale , as the super - partner masses do not appear to be very close to @xmath61 , small threshold corrections to mass squared differences due to super - partners are quite natural in any such model containing the mssm . in the next section we present derivation of new formulas showing how majorana phases also affect threshold corrections in all models having quasi - degenerate neutrino masses .",
    "with mssm as the effective theory below the gut - seesaw scale and non - degenerate super - partner masses new threshold corrections at @xmath61 arise in any model having quasi - degenerate neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "they have been derived  in the quasi - degenerate case in the limit @xmath119 and @xmath120 but without phases @xcite .",
    "following the same procedure and noting that the mixing matrix elements @xmath121 now contain majorana phases , we obtain the new generalized analytic formulas which are valid in all models with quasi - degenerate spectrum ,    ( m_21 ^ 2)_th & = & 4m^2 , + ( m_31 ^ 2)_th & = & 4m^2 , + ( m_32 ^ 2)_th & = & 4m^2[eq22 ] here @xmath122 represents the common mass of quasi - degenerate neutrinos .",
    "the functions @xmath123 are one loop factors obtained by evaluation of corresponding feynman diagrams , especially with wino and charged slepton exchanges @xcite .",
    "t_=(g^2/ 32 ^ 2)[(x_^2-x_^2)/ ( y_y_)+((y_^2 - 1)/ y_^2 ) ln(x_^2)- ( ( y_^2 - 1)/ y_^2)ln(x_^2)][eq23 ]    where @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 charged slepton mass , and @xmath127 wino mass . and the loop - factor has been defined to give @xmath128 without any loss of generality .",
    "depending upon the allowed low energy values of the majorana phases the threshold corrections may vary for given values of the super - partner masses .",

    "for example with the input value of one majorana phase set to a vanishing value at the gut - seesaw scale ( @xmath152 ) , the radiative magnification to bi - large neutrino mixings takes place for all values of the other majorana phase @xmath153 except at @xmath154 where almost total damping occurs for the magnification of @xmath62 .",

    "we emphasize that since the super - partner masses may be naturally in the range of @xmath208 gev @xmath209 tev , small threshold corrections in the mssm near the electroweak scale or even at @xmath210 tev are quite natural .",
    "taking into account the allowed range of positive mass eigenvalues this analysis predicts the sum of three quasi - degenerate neutrino masses to be in the range @xmath211 ev .",

    "as pointed out earlier @xcite and utilized in sec .",
    "iv and table i the low energy solutions for @xmath118 in the presence or absence of majorana phases need small threshold corrections due to possible spreading of sfermion masses above the electroweak scale to bring @xmath118 to be in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "of course these corrections are quite natural and must be included in any susy model of quasi - degenerate neutrino masses . in the present case",
    "a class of our solutions for @xmath118 need such small threshold corrections which are readily computed as discussed in @xcite .    in this section",
    "we find an interesting new aspect of the radiative magnification mechanism in the presence of majorana phases : i.e. there is a region in the parameter space which needs no threshold corrections for the mass squared differences to be in agreement with observations . in terms of initial values of the majorana phases we find that this region of parameter space is described to a very good approximation by the two branches of the curve presented in fig .",

    "further the sum of the three neutrino masses is also consistent with the cosmological bound including those from wmap .",
    "it is interesting to examine the physical origin behind such solutions .",
    "at first we note that eq.(30 ) looks very much like a strong damping condition on the radiative magnification of @xmath62 as discussed in sec.iii .",
    "but , in reality , the values of majorana phases change from their high - scale boundary values and while the major part of magnification takes place at lower scales , @xmath216 becomes positive and remains in the moderate damping region .",
    "in fact we have found from low energy values obtained from rg evolution that @xmath217 as shown in table .",
    "ii .    having shown that this cosine function is in the moderate damping region it then follows from eq.(7 ) that the radiative magnification of @xmath62 in the presence of such moderate damping requires smaller mass difference between @xmath43 and @xmath42 than the corresponding case with weaker damping .",
    "this then leads to solutions to rges with smaller @xmath118 which needs no threshold corrections .",
    "in conclusion , we have extended the results of the high scale mixing unification ( hum ) hypothesis discussed in @xcite by including the effects of the cp phases .",
    "we have considered the cases with and without the majorana phases . while the mixing unification hypothesis predicts the dirac phase to be equal to the ckm phase , it leaves the majorana phases arbitrary since they have no quark counterpart and will most likely arise from the right handed neutrino sector . for both cases ,",
    "we find consistent quasi - degenerate neutrino mass patterns that lead to desired amount of radiative magnification of the mixings in agreement with data .",
    "the predictions of the model are as follows : the common mass of the neutrinos must be larger than @xmath218 ev ; the values of @xmath10 and cp phases in the lepton sector are also predicted at low energies . in the case without the majorana phase , the low energy cp violating effect is small with @xmath219 , whereas for the case with majorana phases , @xmath139 can be as large as @xmath220 .",
    "an interesting phenomenon in the latter case is the damping of radiative magnification of neutrino mixing angles which constrains the majorana phases to remain in a certain range for the model to explains the two large neutrino mixing angles . in this case",
