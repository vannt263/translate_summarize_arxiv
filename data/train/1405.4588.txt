    "recent experiments on spin transport along dna molecules have made an important breakthrough in molecular spintronics.@xcite ghler _",
    "_ reported that the electrons transmitted through self - assembled monolayers of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) at room temperature were highly polarized and that the spin polarization increased with the dna length , while spin - dependent effects were not observed in single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) monolayers.@xcite later on , by measuring charge transport in a two - terminal setup , xie _ et al . _",
    "further substantiated that single dsdna molecules can act as very efficient spin filters.@xcite very recently , mishra _ et al .",

    "al.__@xcite proposed minimal model hamiltonian approaches to rationalize spin selectivity .",
    "both approaches relied on the basic assumption that a helical electric field , mirroring the helical symmetry of the molecular systems , could be the source of a spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) contribution , thus relating spin propagation and helical symmetry .    while the above theoretical approaches were more appropriate for describing a charge or spin _ transport",
    "_ set - up , earlier investigations addressed the problem from the point of view of scattering theory , which is more suitable for the photoemission experiments,@xcite where the moving charges are not probing the molecular orbital structure of the system due to their higher energies ( above the vacuum level ) .",
    "thus , yeganeh _ et al .",
    "_ studied the transmission of spin - polarized electrons through helically shaped potentials,@xcite but found a very weak effect for realistic model parameters .",
    "these studies were extended in ref .   to include decoherence effects within the framework of scattering theory .",
    "more recently , gersten _ et al .",
    "_ suggested that the role of soc in the metallic substrate should also be taken into account.@xcite they showed that an interplay of strong substrate soc and molecular helical symmetry could also induce spin selectivity .",
    "eremko and loktev considered an incoming electron in a pure spin state and its reflection and transmission across a helical potential ; they analytically provided the spin polarization of the transmitted electron.@xcite we also mention studies by vager and vager relating spin - dependent effects to the presence of bound states in charge motion along a curved path.@xcite independently of the specific details of the proposed models and of the experimental setups , all studies listed above clearly agree in suggesting that the helical symmetry of the probed molecules is a key ingredient in inducing spin - selective electron transmission.@xcite    turning again to the electrical transport experiments,@xcite it is well - known from the field of molecular electronics that the molecule - electrode interface plays a critical role in determining the electrical response of the system ( see , e.g. ref .  ) . generally speaking",
    ", the contacts can be classified into two categories .",
    "firstly , a contact can be realized through physical adsorption of the molecule to the electrodes ( physisorption ) .",
    "for instance , the two terminals of the molecule can be directly deposited on the electrodes,@xcite or they can be attracted to the nanoparticles of the metal electrodes by electrostatic trapping.@xcite in this case , several sites of the molecule may be attached to the electrodes with finite cross - section .",
    "secondly , the contact can be also achieved through chemisorption between the molecule and the electrodes mediated e.g. , by thiol groups.@xcite such chemical contacts favor reproducible results and may not mask the intrinsic switching properties of the molecule.@xcite in this second category , there is usually one site of the molecule connected to the electrodes .    motivated by these issues , we explore in this paper the spin transport properties of _ double - helical _  ( dh ) molecular systems by considering various contact configurations in the fully coherent charge transport regime . our results show a fundamental distinction for different contacts .",
    "the spin polarization turns out to be exactly zero in two - terminal molecular devices when they are coupled to one - dimensional ( 1d ) electrodes or if only a single site at each edge of the molecule is attached to an electrode with finite cross - section . in this case , dephasing is a necessary ingredient to induce the spin - filtering effects .",
    "contrarily , nonzero spin polarization appears in a multi - terminal set - up , or a two - terminal one with more than one site of the molecule connected to each finite - width electrode .",
    "additionally , we also investigate the influence of the asymmetry between the two helical chains of the molecule and find that the magnitude of spin polarization could be enhanced by increasing this asymmetry .",
    "we remark that these results are consistent with the main conclusions in refs .   and .",
    "we finally point out that the spin - filtering effects could emerge in the dh molecular devices , e.g. , dsdna devices , at low temperature without dephasing by properly tuning the electrode number and the connection between the molecule and the electrodes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the theoretical model and the parameters are presented . in secs .",
    "iii and iv , we investigate the conductance and the spin polarization for the two- and the multi - terminal set - up with 1d electrodes .",

    "spin transport along the dh molecule can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 describe the dh molecule and the electrodes including the molecule - electrode coupling , respectively .",
    "the dh molecule is represented by a two - leg ladder model @xcite including the soc term and can be expressed as@xcite @xmath3\\big\\ } + \\sum_{n=1}^{n } \\big[\\lambda c_{1n}^{\\dagger}c_{2n}^{}+ { \\rm h.c . }",

    "we remark however , that the factor @xmath19 changes the symmetry of the system and thus the behavior of the spin polarization is not exactly the same .    for the sake of clarity ,",
    "the electronic parameters are regarded as uniform along each helical chain of the dh molecule . here",
    ", let us focus on the dna molecule as an example .",
    "it is well established that the double - helical structure of the dna molecule is constructed by four nucleobases  guanine ( g ) , adenine ( a ) , cytosine ( c ) , and thymine ( t)based on the complementary base - pairing rule . since both the structures and the number of atoms of these nucleobases are different from each other , there",
    "may exist asymmetries in the electronic parameters between the two dna strands , as demonstrated from first - principles calculations.@xcite therefore , we employ an additional parameter @xmath22 to describe this asymmetry . some of the electronic parameters are fixed to be @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , in units of ev , while others are taken as @xmath28 and @xmath29 to simulate the asymmetry between the two helical chains .",
    "the remaining parameters are chosen as @xmath30 , @xmath31 rad , and @xmath32 , resembling the b - form dsdna molecule .",
    "notice that the asymmetry parameter @xmath22 is included in an inverse way between the intrachain hopping integrals and the socs .",
    "this parametrization was demonstrated as the favorable situation to obtain large spin polarization.@xcite    the remaining hamiltonian @xmath33 splits into the hamiltonian of the left and right nonmagnetic electrodes @xmath34 and the hamiltonian @xmath35 for the coupling between the molecule and the electrodes . here",

    "although we are considering single - electron physics here , we use the conventional labeling and refer to these bands as the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) band and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) band , respectively . in both bands , due to the soc effects , the energy region close to the gap presents a higher density of the transmission peaks . however , the conductance is very sensitive to the contact configuration .",
    "if both helical chains are connected to the electrodes , resonant states with @xmath68 are found in the whole range of the bands in the energy spectrum [ figs .",
    "[ fig : one](e ) and [ fig : one](f ) ] , while if only a single site of the molecule is attached to each electrode , the resonant states are considerably suppressed [ figs .",

    "this behavior is related to the time - reversal symmetry and the phase - locking effect in two - terminal devices.@xcite    as shown in ref .",
    ", additional dephasing is necessary to yield nonzero spin polarization in this situation .",
    "when an electron is transmitted through the molecular system , it may experience inelastic scattering events , which lead to the loss of phase memory , and can be simulated by attaching each site of the molecule to a bttiker s virtual electrode . as a result",

    "the dephasing promotes the openness of the two - terminal devices and induces the spin - filtering effects.@xcite actually , the bttiker s virtual electrode is similar to the real one , because their hamiltonians are identical to each other .",
    "however , with bttiker s probes zero current flow must be enforced through them in order to have current conservation , because the probes are not necessarily physical terminals but mathematical artefacts to induce dephasing.@xcite hence , one may expect that nonzero spin polarization could be observed in the dh molecular devices when the virtual electrode is replaced by the real one , which will be investigated in the following sections .",

    "it can be seen that the transmission spectra are also composed of the homo and lumo bands for all investigated values of @xmath22 , and the spin - up conductance exhibits several resonant peaks of @xmath68 .",
    "if the asymmetry factor @xmath22 becomes larger , the hopping integral along the first helical chain is increased and thus , the bandwidth of the homo band broadens .",
    "this leads to the shift of the lumo band toward higher energies , owing to the repulsion effects between the two helical chains .",

    "the interchain hopping integral in the electrode region is considered as @xmath79 .",
    "although both models 3a and 3b are two - terminal systems , they are obviously more open than models 1a-1d , because more than one site of the molecule is attached to different sites of each electrode in models 3a and 3b . in fact , the connection between the molecule and the electrodes of model 3a ( 3b ) is the same as model 2a ( 2b ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "@xmath85 increases with @xmath22 in the range @xmath86 and is then declined by further increasing @xmath22 .",
    "this behavior is related to the intrinsic effects of the dh molecule itself and does not depend upon the particular contact configuration at all .",
    "when @xmath22 is sufficiently large , the hopping integral of the first helical chain is much larger than that of the second one and the electron will be preferentially transmitted along the first helical chain .",

    "indeed , it is determined by both the type of real electrodes and the connection between the molecule and the electrodes . on the one hand , since the number of sites connected to each electrode for models 2b and 3b is twice as large as that for models 2a and 3a , the former two models are more open and exhibit higher @xmath46 ( see the dashed and dash - dotted lines in fig .  [",

    "is switched into model 3a ( 3b ) by coupling two neighboring 1d electrodes with the hopping integral @xmath87 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ] and the multi - terminal devices are changed into the two - terminal ones simultaneously . as a result , the openness of the systems is decreased .",
    "this can also be understood as follows if we consider models 2a and 3a as an example . in the absence of @xmath87 ,",
    "the two 1d electrodes are separated from each other and the mode number in the electrode region is 2 for model 2a , disregarding the spin degree of freedom . while in the presence of @xmath87 , the 1d electrodes are combined together as a whole and the corresponding effective mode number is reduced to 1 when they are coupled to each other extremely tightly with @xmath88 . in the moderate range of @xmath89 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath79 in model 3a , the effective mode number can be 1 or 2 at different energy regions .",
    "similar arguments can be discussed between models 2b and 3b . accordingly , the spin polarization of model 2a ( 2b ) is higher than model 3a ( 3b ) . from the above two points , model 2b possesses the largest @xmath82",

    "[ fig : five ] that although the conductance profiles of models 1c , 5a , and 5b are similar , the magnitude of @xmath45 , especially in the energy regions closest to the band gap , is different among the three devices .",
    "this is attributed to the quantum interference effects at the interface between the molecule and the electrodes .",
    "since the electrode width is different for models 1c , 5a , and 5b , the injection ( ejection ) mode is distinct and the conductance will be changed from one device to another .",

    "the physics here is totally different from models 3a and 3b , although the only difference between models 5a ( 5b ) and 3a ( 3b ) is that in the former case only single site of the molecule is attached to each electrode .",
    "in summary , we have studied the spin transport along a double - helical molecule by considering various contact configurations in a completely coherent charge transport regime .",
    "we find that the conductance and the spin polarization strongly depend upon the contact configurations for the coherent transport case .",
    "no spin polarization emerges in the two - terminal set - up when they are coupled to the 1d electrodes or if there is a bottleneck of only one site connecting the molecule to finite - width electrodes . in this case ,",
    "additional dephasing is necessary to support spin - filtering effects.@xcite in contrast , the spin polarization appears in the multi - terminal set - up or the two - terminal one with more than one site of the molecule connected to each finite - width electrode , because in the multi - terminal devices the extra terminals can play similar role as the bttiker s virtual electrode , which can cause dephasing .",
    "this effect could be further enhanced by increasing the asymmetry between the two helical chains of the molecule , a result related to that found in ref .   for a different model , where spin transport through two transport channels on a single helix was studied .",

    "<S> , nonzero spin polarization is found in molecular devices with multiple terminals or with two finite - width electrodes , each of them connected to more than one site of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> then , the magnitude of spin polarization can be enhanced by increasing the asymmetry between the two strands . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the spin - filtering effects could emerge in double - helical molecular devices at low temperature without dephasing by a proper choice of the electrode number and the connection between the molecule and the electrodes . </S>"
