    "new experimental methods , particularly , based on the multiple coincidence detection technique @xcite stimulate the interest to fundamental theoretical studies of the dissociative ionization of diatomic molecules by electron impact . in this context",
    "the molecular hydrogen ion can be considered as the basic system in which the removal of the unique electron causes dissociation .",
    "substantial theoretical analysis of the dissociative ionization of @xmath0 by fast electrons was recently carried out in @xcite . as mentioned in @xcite , the crucial point of calculating the cross - section of such processes",
    "is that no closed exact analytical wave functions of the continuum states exist . in @xcite",
    "the final - state wave function of the ejected electron was found by taking a product of two approximate functions that take into account the two scattering centers . to improve the calculation it seems straightforward to obtain these functions with the exact numerical solutions of the two - center continuum problem .",
    "however , this approach involves a cumbersome procedure of calculating multi - dimensional integrals of the functions presented numerically that requires huge computer facilities and may cause additional computational problems .",
    "it seems reasonable to search for direct computational approaches , in which the basis of exact two - center continuum wave functions is not involved .",
    "note that the potential advantage of such methods is that they could be generalized over a wider class of two - center systems starting from the molecular hydrogen ion as a test object . in the present paper",
    "we develop a direct approach to the ionization of hydrogen molecular ion by fast electrons that involves the reduction of the initial 6d schrdinger equation to a 3d evolution problem followed by modeling of the wave packet dynamics .",
    "originally we intended to treat the incoming electron classically , its trajectory being approximated by a straight line with the deflection neglected .",
    "the bound electron was to be treated quantum mechanically .",
    "preliminary calculations at the impact parameter @xmath1 a.u . has shown , first , that the probability of the emission of the electron having the energy of 50 ev is extremely small , and , second , that the direction of the electron emission is orthogonal to that of the incoming electron motion , that contradicts the results of @xcite .",
    "this means that the main contribution to the small - angle scattering comes from the central collisions with the bound electron in the region of its localization .",
    "generally , the classically estimated deflection angle of @xmath2 for scattered electron corresponds to the impact parameter of the order of 1 a.u .",
    ", so that the trajectory passes through the molecule and the classical treatment of the incoming electron is not valid .    here",
    "we develop and apply a direct approach to the calculation of the angular distribution of scattered and ejected electrons that involves the reduction of the initial 6d schrdinger equation to a 3d evolution problem followed by modeling of the wave packet dynamics .",
    "the approach does not make use of the basis of stationary coulomb two - center functions of the continuous spectrum for the ejected electron , whose proper choice is a crucial point of other model calculations .",
    "our approach can be considered as the linearized version of the phase function method @xcite for the multi - dimensional scattering problem .",
    "the evolution problem is solved using the method based on the split - step technique @xcite with complex scaling , recently proposed by some of us and tested in paraxial optics @xcite . in the present paper",
    "the method as a whole is also tested using the well known problem of electron scattering by hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "we start from the 6d stationary schrdinger equation which describes two electrons in the field of two fixed protons @xmath3\\psi({\\bf r},{\\bf r})=e \\psi({\\bf r},{\\bf r } ) , \\label{schr6d}\\ ] ]        where @xmath4 is the radius - vector of the electron initially bound in @xmath5 and finally ejected , @xmath6 is the radius - vector of the impact electron , @xmath7 is hamiltonian of ejected electron in the field of two protons , @xmath8 is the interaction between the impact electron and molecular ion , @xmath9 is the attractive potential between the ejected ( scattered ) electron and the protons , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the radius - vector of the i - th proton , @xmath13 is the repulsive potential of interaction between the electrons .",
    "the origin of the coordinate frame is chosen in the center of symmetry of the molecular ion with the @xmath14 axis directed along the momentum of the incident electron .    for the scattering problem solved here the energy of the system",
    "may be presented as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ionization potential , @xmath17 is the momentum of the incident electron .",
    "let us seek the solution of eq.([schr6d ] ) in the form @xmath18 . under the condition that @xmath19 one can neglect the second derivative of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath14 . as a result",
    "we get the evolution - like equation for the envelope function @xmath21    @xmath22    neglecting the large - angle scattering one can write the initial condition for @xmath20 as @xmath23    to solve the 5d schrdinger evolution equation([evolution ] ) we use fourier transformation with respect to the variable @xmath24 @xmath25    then eq.([evolution ] ) takes the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fourier transform of the interaction potential @xmath28 .",
    "further simplification of the problem is possible if the amplitude of the incident wave is much greater than that of the scattered wave .",
    "in this case one can put @xmath29 in the integral term of eq.([prepbasiceq ] ) . as a result",
    "we get the inhomogeneous equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 , with the initial condition @xmath32 .",
    "to calculate the integral with respect to transverse variables in the expression for @xmath33 it is easier to start from the known integral @xmath34 carrying out the inverse fourier transformation @xmath35 one gets @xmath36 . \\label{matrixel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath37 is the transverse momentum component of the scattered electron , @xmath38 is the scattering angle , @xmath39 are the positions of the nuclei with respect to the center of symmetry .",
    "note that terms in square brackets determine the elastic scattering of the incident electron by the nuclei .    due to the exponential decrease of the source term with @xmath40 the integration may be actually carried out within a certain finite interval @xmath41 .",
    "hence the zero initial condition should be imposed at the point @xmath42 .",
    "note that the approximation ( [ born ] ) is actually equivalent to the first born approximation @xcite .",
    "multiply eq.([basiceq ] ) by the complex conjugate function of the continuous spectrum of @xmath43 and integrate over all @xmath4 .",

    "let us substitute @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the increment of the longitudinal component of the momentum of the impact electron determined by the relation @xmath49 this relation is actually equivalent to the energy conservation law written neglecting the terms of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "the substitution yields @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the momentum of the scattered electron , @xmath54 is the momentum transfer .",

    "the expression ( [ asboundary2 ] ) agrees with ( [ asboundary ] ) within the accuracy of the order of @xmath64 if we set @xmath65 the latter expression is similar to the formula for @xmath66 derived in @xcite using the first born approximation .",

    "becomes exact when @xmath78 and simultaneously @xmath79 .",
    "the amplitudes defined by ( [ amplitudes ] ) are related with the coefficients introduced in eq.([c ] ) by @xmath80 using ( [ sigma]),([f ] ) and ( [ ac ] ) we get the final expression for the differential cross - section @xmath81    in the region where @xmath82 we made use of the complex scaling technique @xcite to suppress the non - physical reflection from the grid boundary .",

    "( [ crnc2 ] ) which defines nothing but cranck - nicholson scheme . to solve this equation",
    "we make use of the partial coordinate splitting ( pcs ) .",
    "a finite - difference scheme is applied for the radial variable @xmath86 and the polar angle @xmath87 .",
    "fast fourier transform ( fft ) is used for the azimuthal angle @xmath88 .    in the spherical coordinate system , the @xmath89-axis of which",
    "is directed along the symmetry axis of the molecule ( and not along the velocity of the impact electron ) and after the substitution @xmath90 and the fourier transformation of eq.([crnc2 ] ) the terms @xmath91 entering this equation turn into @xmath92\\psi(r,\\eta , m){\\nonumber \\\\ } & & + u(r,\\eta)\\psi(r,\\eta , m),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 , @xmath94 is the asimuthal quantum number .",

    ". direct solution of each set of equations requires @xmath102 operations at each step in @xmath103 .",
    "the fft that should be performed twice , first , when proceeding from ( [ crnc1 ] ) to ( [ crnc2 ] ) , and second , from ( [ crnc2 ] ) to ( [ crnc3 ] ) , requires @xmath104 extra operations .    to reduce the number of operation we propose a double - cycle split - step scheme . in case",
    "when @xmath43 can be presented as a sum @xmath105 , this scheme can be formulated as follows @xmath106 which to within the second - order terms in @xmath84 corresponds to the initial cranck - nicholson scheme , @xmath107 and @xmath108 is square matrixes , @xmath109 .",
    "now the problem is how to split the hamiltonian @xmath43 into two parts .",
    "formal separation of radial and angular parts leads to difficulties associated with the singularity of the angular part . due to this singularity",
    "the scheme appears to be conditionally stable with severe limitations imposed on the step @xmath84 .",
    "practically this version of the splitting scheme is applicable only if the grid in @xmath86 is rough enough .    to remove this limitation",
    "we propose a partial coordinate splitting scheme .",
    "its principal idea is that in the vicinity of @xmath110 it is preferable not to split off the angular part at all .",
    "to implement this idea we introduce the @xmath86-dependent weight function @xmath111 which is supposed to diminish in the vicinity of @xmath110 and define the discrete approximation of the operators @xmath112 in the following way @xmath113;\\\\   \\lefteqn{(\\hat h_2^m)_{i_2 i_1 j_2 j_1}=}{\\nonumber \\\\ } & &   ( 1-p(r_{i_1}))\\left[-\\frac{1}{2 }   \\frac{{\\hat d^{\\eta , m}}_{j_2 j_1}}{r_{i_1}^2}\\delta_{i_2 i_1 }   + u_{2}(r_{i_1},\\eta_{j_1})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath114 .",
    "it is reasonable to choose @xmath111 as a cubic polynomial @xmath115 ^ 3 - 3\\left[\\frac{r - r_a}{a_p}\\right]^2 + 1,&r_a < r",
    "< r_a+a_p;\\\\ 1,&r\\leq r_a;\\\\ 0,&r\\geq r_a+a_p ; \\end{array } \\right .",
    "& & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the radius of the vicinity of @xmath110 where the splitting is absent , @xmath117 is the width of the area of partial splitting .",
    "such a polynomial satisfies the condition of smooth connection at the boundaries that separate the region of partial splitting from the regions of full splitting , on one hand , and of no splitting at all , on another hand .",
    "the method was tested using the well - studied example of the impact ionization of atomic hydrogen .",
    "we compared our results with those given by the well - known expression obtained in the first born approximation @xcite .",
    "good agreement was demonstrated in the energy interval of interest @xmath118 from 1 to 3 a.u .",

    "one of the protons with the ejection angle @xmath120 at different orientations of the molecular axis , provided that the scattering angle is small .",
    "the examples of our results illustrated by figs.[figqeee]-[figqd ] are obtained under the following conditions : the momentum of the impact electron @xmath12212.13 a.u .",
    "( @xmath123 ev ) ; the angle of scattering @xmath124 .",
    "the impact and ejected electron trajectories and the molecular axis are supposed to lie in one plane .",
    "the latter restriction is not imposed by the method as such , it is just an example .",
    "generally , one gets full information about the ejected electron , i.e. , the dependence of mdcs from @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath125 , after each run of the code at given values of the impact energy , scattering angle and molecular axis orientation . in fig.[figqeee ] demonstrates the energy - angle distribution , extracted from the data getting in result of one run of the code . in the planar geometry the orientation of the molecular ion",
    "is determined by a single angle @xmath126 between the impact direction and the internuclear axis .",
    "we remind that the momentum transfer vector was defined above as @xmath127 . in figs .",
    "[ fig4qe ] we present the particular cases of the dependence of mdcs upon @xmath120 when internuclear axis is a)parallel to the momentum transfer ; b)perpendicular to the momentum transfer ; c)parallel to the impact electron direction @xmath128 ; d)perpendicular to the impact electron direction @xmath128 . as it could be expected basing on the elementary symmetry considerations , the first two plots are symmetric with respect to the direction of the momentum transfer that corresponds to the angle @xmath129 .",
    "since this symmetry is not assumed _ a priori _ in the procedure , this may be considered as one more evidence in favour of the validity of the results demonstrated .     versus the ejection angle @xmath120 and molecular angle @xmath126 .",

    "all the momentum is transferred to the ejected electron and the probability of the ionization is maximal .",
    "this is confirmed around @xmath133 on figures [ fig4qe](a ) and [ fig4qe](b ) where the inter - nuclear axis is respectively perpendicular and parallel to @xmath132 .",
    "so this is a good verification for our calculation .",
    "now , for the situation where @xmath46 is anti - parallel to @xmath132 , the recoil momentum @xmath134 is maximal and the probability of the ionization is maximal .",
    "this is also visible for @xmath135 .",
    "now for the directions of the internuclear axis other than @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 is parallel to @xmath132 ) or @xmath138 ( where @xmath137 is perpendicular to @xmath132 ) the target does not respect the above analysis .",
    "this is due to the fact that the diatomic target behaves as an atomic target only for these two angles .",
    "the other situations present interference patterns the minima of which move when @xmath126 changes .",
    "fig.[figqeqd ] shows mdcs versus the ejection angle @xmath120 and internuclear angle @xmath126 .",
    "as one can see , this dependence has rather a complex behaviour .    to confirm the above dependence we show in fig.[figqd ] a section of fig.[figqeqd ] for fixed ejection angle @xmath129 which corresponds to the case when the ejected electron direction is parallel to the momentum transfer vector .",
    "it presents a variation of the mdcs with respect to the direction of the inter - nuclear axis .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the maximal value of mdcs is achieved when the internuclear axis is perpendicular to the momentum transfer direction that correspond to @xmath138 .",
    "this result agrees with the hypothesis formulated in @xcite .",
    "we have developed a procedure which determines the multiply differential cross section of the ( e,2e ) ionization of hydrogen molecular ion by fast electron impact , using a direct approach which reduces the problem to a 3d evolution problem solved numerically .",
