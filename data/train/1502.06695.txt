    "the above approximation problems come from hermite s study on arithmetic properties of the exponential function and are called collectively the _ hermite - pad approximations _ ; often , the former is referred to as the ` type i ' and the latter as the ` type ii ' or as the _ simultaneous pad approximation_. note that if @xmath14 then both of them reduce to the ( usual ) pad approximations .",

    "[ sect : hpa ] , we begin by introducing the two types of rational approximations for an @xmath0-tuple of functions , which are slightly modified ( in order to fit the construction of schlesinger transformations ) from the original hermite - pad and simultaneous pad approximations .",

    "equations yields its schlesinger transformation ( see theorem  [ thm : schl ] ) ; in fact , mahler s duality guarantees the absence of apparent singularities in the new fuchsian system after the schlesinger transformation . in sect .",

    "[ sect : aid ] , we first review the _ schlesinger system _ of nonlinear differential equations , which governs isomonodromic deformations of a fuchsian system . since a schlesinger transformation preserves the monodromy of the fuchsian system , it gives rise to a discrete symmetry of the corresponding schlesinger system .",
    "we clarify , based on the above relationship with rational approximations , the determinantal structure in the general solutions of the schlesinger systems .",
    "next we concern a particular family of the schlesinger systems , which possesses a unified description as a polynomial hamiltonian system denoted by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) ; it includes various noteworthy examples of isomonodromic deformations such as the sixth painlev equation ( @xmath24 ) and the garnier system in @xmath25 variables ( @xmath26 ) . in sect .",

    "our present normalization treats the two points @xmath94 and @xmath96 equally and it emerges naturally from the similarity reduction of the uc hierarchy , which is a context of infinite - dimensional integrable systems ; see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as clarified by haraoka @xcite , this normalization is effective to find a ` good ' coordinate of the space of fuchsian systems having a given riemann scheme .",

    "it is known that if we specify an admissible discrete change of the characteristic exponents then the corresponding rational function matrix @xmath84 of the schlesinger transformation is algebraically computable from @xmath107 ; see @xcite .",
    "in fact , the construction problem of schlesinger transformations is naturally related to rational approximation problems ; see also remark  [ remark : history ] .",
    "in this paper we focus on a class of schlesinger transformations , which is of particular interest from the viewpoint of hermite s two approximation problems and also of vector continued fractions ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : cf ] ) . note that , for a general schlesinger transformation other than the present direction , though it can also be controlled by some rational approximation problems but it becomes much more complicated due to the absence of a duality like mahler s ; e.g. @xmath115 seems not to have a concise determinantal representation .",

    "also , we verify from ( [ eq : r&r-1 ] ) that @xmath84 does not change the form of the power series expansion of @xmath107 near @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , the coefficient @xmath127 of the fuchsian system ( [ eq : fs ] ) is transformed as @xmath128 if we remember both @xmath84 and @xmath115 being polynomials ( see corollary  [ cor : r ] ) , then @xmath129 turns out to be a rational function matrix having only simple poles at @xmath108 as well as the original @xmath130 . in this sense",
    "mahler s duality guarantees the absence of apparent singularities in the new equation @xmath131 satisfied by @xmath132 .    in the rank two case ( @xmath14 )",
    "a similar construction of schlesinger transformations as theorem  [ thm : schl ] has been established in @xcite based on ( usual ) pad approximations .",
    "[ remark : history ] a series of pioneering works was done by d. chudnovsky and g. chudnovsky on the close connection between rational approximation problems and riemann s monodromy problem , involving ( semi - classical ) orthogonal polynomials ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the ` pad method ' recently proposed by yamada @xcite is a recipe for lax formalism of painlev equations and , at the same time , for their special solutions , which is based on pad approximations ( or interpolations ) of elementary functions ; interestingly enough , it is applicable also for various discrete analogues of painlev equations beyond the originals ; see @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of the above works could be exemplified by the following : let us consider a function @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "the remainder @xmath135 of its pad approximation then satisfies a second - order linear differential equation denoted by @xmath136 , which may have an apparent singularity besides the four regular singularities @xmath137 .",
    "however , the two functions @xmath138 and @xmath139 share the same multi - valuedness since they are rationally related ; thus , the monodromy of @xmath136 is obviously constant with respect to @xmath140 .",
    "this fact leads to special solutions of the sixth painlev equation @xmath141 , i.e. the _ isomonodromic deformation _ ( cf .",
    "[ sect : aid ] ) of a second - order linear differential equation with four regular singularities .",
    "it is interesting to note that such an idea had been recognized implicitly by laguerre ( before the discovery of painlev equations ) ; see @xcite and also @xcite .",
