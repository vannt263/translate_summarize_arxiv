    "this can be seen by using an @xmath117-size density matrix basis , ( generalizing the @xmath118-size density matrix basis of the previous section ) .",
    "first choose @xmath119 with all other elements vanishing , which implies @xmath120 .",

    "a matrix @xmath116 for which @xmath130 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "therefore , @xmath131 is a hermitian matrix , where we regard the number pairs 11 , 12 , 21 , 22 as four different indices .",
    "that is , @xmath131 is a @xmath132 dimensional matrix .",
    "the most general @xmath132 hermitian matrix is characterized by 16 real numbers ( the four real diagonal matrix elements and the six complex matrix elements above the diagonal ) .",
    "since there are 32 real numbers which characterized the most general superoperator in a two dimensional space , the condition of hermiticity of the density matrix has cut that number in half .",
    "a hermitian matrix can be written in terms of its orthonormal eigenvectors and eigenvalues , and that decomposition shall prove very useful here .",
    "there are four real eigenvalues , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 .",
    "corresponding to each eigenvalue is an eigenvector @xmath135 in the four dimensional complex vector space .",
    "the four complex components of @xmath136 make 32 real numbers , but they are constrained .",
    "each eigenvector is normalized to 1 : @xmath137 provides 8 constraints , lowering the number of free components to 24 .",
    "the orthogonality of @xmath138 to the other three vectors provides 6 constraints , the orthogonality of @xmath139 to the remaining two vectors provides 4 constraints , and the orthogonality of @xmath140 to @xmath141 provides two constraints .",
    "thus , there are 12 constraints on the 24 free components , so the eigenvectors contain 12 free components .",
    "these , together with the four eigenvalues , comprise the 16 real numbers characterizing @xmath131 .",
    "an example of such an orthonormal basis is given by @xmath142 multiplying the pauli+1 basis .",

    "this leads to a neat way of writing the orthogonality relations for these eigenvectors . instead of @xmath153",
    ", we can write @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the hermitian conjugate ( complex conjugate transpose ) of @xmath156 .",

    "the expression for the components of @xmath131 written in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues is @xmath158 putting this into eq.([x1 ] ) results in the _ evolution equation _",

    ". this must hold for arbitrary @xmath166 .",
    "we have seen how to handle such an expression . by successively putting in the four density basis matrices ,",
    "we obtain the trace constraint @xmath167      the @xmath28-dimensional case works just like the two - dimensional case .",

    ", we obtain the trace constraint : @xmath174    by taking the trace of eq.([x6 ] ) and using eq.([x4a ] ) , we find the interesting relation @xmath175",
    "the final constraint is _ positivity_. this says , given an arbitrary n - dimensional vector @xmath176 , that the expectation value of the density matrix @xmath177 is non - negative .",
    "this constraint , applied to eq.([x5 ] ) , is @xmath178 where we have defined @xmath179 .",
