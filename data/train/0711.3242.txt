    "content - based multimedia retrieval applications with their prominent image retrieval systems ( cbirs ) are very popular nowadays with the broad availability of massive digital multimedia libraries .",
    "cbir systems spurred an intensive line of research for better _ ad - hoc _ feature extractions and effective yet accurate geometric clustering techniques . in a typical cbir system",
    "@xcite , database images are processed offline during a preprocessing step by various feature extractors computing image characteristics such as color histograms .",
    "these features are aggregated into signature vectors that represent handles to images .",
    "then given an online query image , the system first computes its signature , and search for the first , say @xmath0 , best matches in the signature space .",
    "this requires to define an appropriate _ similarity measure _ between pairs of signatures . designing an appropriate distance",
    "is tricky since the signature space is often heterogeneous ( ie . , cartesian product of feature spaces ) and the usual euclidean distance or @xmath1-norms do not always make sense .",
    "for example , it is better to use the information - theoretic relative entropy , known as the kullback - leibler divergence , to measure the _ oriented distance _ between image histograms  @xcite .",
    "_ efficiency _ is another key issue of cbir systems since we do not want to compute the similarity measure ( query , image ) for each image in the database .",
    "we rather want to prealably _ cluster _ the signatures efficiently during the preprocessing stage for fast retrieval of the best matches given query signature points . a first seminal work by lloyd in 1957  @xcite proposed the @xmath2-means iterative clustering algorithm .",
    "in short , @xmath2-means starts by choosing @xmath2 seeds for cluster centers , associate to each point its `` closest '' cluster `` center , '' update the various cluster centers , and reiterate until either convergence is met or the difference of the `` loss function '' between any two sucessive iterations goes below a prescribed threshold .",
    "lloyd choosed the _ squared _",
    "euclidean distance since the minimum average intracluster distance yields centroids , the centers of mass of the respective clusters , and further proved that @xmath2-means _ monotonically _ converges to a _",
    "local _ optima .",
    "cluster @xmath3 s center @xmath4 is defined by the minimization problem @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the cardinality of @xmath3 .",
    "half a century later , banerjee et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath2-means algorithm _ extends to _ and _ only _ works for a broad family of distortion measures called bregman divergences  @xcite .",
    "bregman divergences @xmath7 are parameterized families of distortion measures that are defined by a strictly convex and differentiable generator function @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the inner product ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 the gradient at point @xmath14 ( ie . , @xmath15 $ ] ) .",
    "further , teboulle  @xcite generalized this bregman @xmath2-means algorithm in 2007 by considering both hard and soft _ center - based _ clustering algorithms designed for both bregman  @xcite and csiszr @xmath16-divergences  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental underlying primitive for these _ center - based _ clustering algorithms is to find the intrinsic _ best single representative _ of a cluster .",
    "as mentionned above , the centroid of a point set @xmath17 is defined as the optimizer of the _ minimum average distance _ : @xmath18 . for oriented distance functions such as bregman divergences that are not necessarily symmetric",
    ", we thus distinguish _ sided _ and _ symmetrized _ centroids as follows : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . the first right - type and left - type centroids @xmath22 and @xmath23 are called _ sided centroids _ , and the third type centroid @xmath24",
    "is called the _ symmetrized _ bregman centroid . except for the class of generalized quadratic distances with generator @xmath25",
    ", @xmath26 is _ not _ a bregman divergence , see  @xcite .",
    "since the three centroids coincide with the center of mass for symmetric bregman divergences , we consider in the remainder asymmetric bregman divergences .",
    "we write for short @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , so that we get respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the symmetrized kullback - leibler  @xcite and cosh centroids  @xcite ( symmetrized itakura - saito divergence obtained for @xmath32 , the burg entropy ) are certainly the most famous symmetrized bregman centroids , widely used in image and sound processing .",
    "these symmetrized centroids play a fundamental role in applications that require to handle symmetric information - theoretic distances .",
    "prior work in the literature is sparse and disparate .",
    "we summarize below main references that will be concisely revisited in section  [ sec : sided ] under our notational conventions .",
    "ben - tal et al .",
    "@xcite studied _ entropic means _ as the minimum average optimization for various distortion measures such as the @xmath16-divergences and bregman divergences .",
    "their study is limited to the sided left - type ( generalized means ) centroids .",
    "basseville and cardoso  @xcite compared in the 1-page paper the generalized / entropic mean values for two entropy - based classes of divergences : @xmath16-divergences  @xcite and jensen - shannon divergences  @xcite .",
    "the closest recent work to our study is veldhuis approximation method  @xcite for computing the symmetrical kullback - leibler centroid .",
    "we summarize our contributions as follows :    * in section  [ sec : sided ] , we show that the two sided bregman centroids @xmath22 and @xmath23 with respect to bregman divergence @xmath7 are _ unique _ and easily obtained as _",
    "generalized means _ for the identity and @xmath33 functions , respectively .",
    "we extend sibson s notion of _ information radius _",
    "@xcite for these sided centroids , and show that they are both equal to the @xmath34-jensen difference , a generalized jensen - shannon divergence  @xcite also known as burbea - rao divergences  @xcite . *",
    "section  [ sec : symmetrized ] proceeds by first showing how to reduce the symmetrized @xmath35 optimization problem into a simpler system that depends only on the two sided centroids @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we then geometrically characterize _ exactly _ the symmetrized centroid as the intersection point of the geodesic linking the sided centroids with a new type of divergence bisector : the mixed - type bisector .",
    "this yields a simple and efficient dichotomic search procedure that provably converges fast to the exact symmetrized bregman centroid . *",
    "the symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence ( @xmath36-divergence ) and symmetrized itakura - saito divergence ( cosh distance ) are often used in sound / image applications , where our fast geodesic dichotomic walk algorithm converging to the unique symmetrized bregman centroid comes in handy over former complex _ adhoc _",
    "methods  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : applications ] considers _ applications _ of the generic geodesic - walk algorithm to two cases : * * the symmetrized kullback - leibler for probability mass functions represented as @xmath37-dimensional points lying in the @xmath38-dimensional simplex @xmath39 .",
    "these discrete distributions are handled as multinomials of the exponential families  @xcite with @xmath40 degrees of freedom .",
    "we instantiate the generic geodesic - walk algorithm for that setting , show how it compares favorably with the prior convex optimization work of veldhuis  @xcite , and validate formally experimental remarks of veldhuis . * * the symmetrized kullback - leibler of multivariate normal distributions .",
    "we describe the geodesic - walk for this particular _ mixed - type _ exponential family of multivariate normals , and explain the legendre mixed - type vector / matrix dual convex conjugates defining the corresponding bregman divergences .",
    "this yields a simple , fast and elegant geometric method compared to the former overly complex method of myrvoll and soong  @xcite that relies on solving riccati matrix equations .",
    "we first prove that the right - type centroid @xmath22 is _ independent _ of the considered bregman divergence @xmath7 : @xmath41 is always the center of mass .",
    "although this result is well - known in disguise in information geometry  @xcite , it was again recently brought up to the attention of the machine learning community by banerjee et al .",
    "@xcite who proved that lloyd s iterative @xmath2-means `` centroid '' clustering algorithm  @xcite generalizes to the class of bregman divergences .",
    "we state the result and give the proof for completeness and familizaring us with notations .",
    "the right - type sided bregman centroid @xmath22 of a set @xmath42 of @xmath43 points @xmath44 , ... @xmath45 , defined as the minimizer for the average right divergence @xmath46 , is unique , independent of the selected divergence @xmath7 , and coincides with the center of mass @xmath47 .    for a given point @xmath14 ,",
    "the right - type average divergence is defined as @xmath48 . expanding the terms @xmath49 s using the definition of bregman divergence",
    ", we get @xmath50 . subtracting and adding @xmath51 to the right - hand side yields    @xmath52    observe that since @xmath53 is _ independent _ of @xmath14 , minimizing @xmath54 is equivalent to minimizing @xmath55 . using the fact that bregman divergences @xmath56 are non - negative , @xmath57 , and equal to zero _ if and only if _ @xmath58 , we conclude that @xmath59 , namely the center of mass of the point set . the minimization remainder , representing the `` information radius '' ( by generalizing the notion introduced by sibson  @xcite for the relative entropy ) , is @xmath60 , which bears the name of the @xmath34-jensen difference on a weight distribution vector @xmath61 : @xmath62 . here",
    ", we consider uniform weighting distribution @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) . ]",
    "@xcite . for @xmath65 the negative shannon entropy ,",
    "@xmath66 is known as the jensen - shannon divergence  @xcite : @xmath67 .",
    "the jensen - shannon divergence is also known as half of the jeffreys divergence ( jd ) : @xmath68 , and can be interpreted as the _ expected information gain _ when discovering which probability distribution is drawn from ( either @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) .",
    "the jensen - shannon divergence can also be interpreted as the _ noisy channel capacity _ with two inputs giving output distributions @xmath69 and @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "jensen - shannon divergences are also useful for providing both lower and upper bounds for bayes probability of error in decision problems  @xcite .      before characterizing the _",
    "left - type _ sided bregman centroid , we recall the fundamental duality of convex analysis : convex conjugation by legendre transformation .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for detailed explanations that we concisely summarize here as follows : any bregman generator function @xmath34 admits a _ dual _ bregman generator function @xmath71 via the legendre transformation @xmath72 .",
    "the supremum is reached at the _ unique _ point where the gradient of @xmath73 vanishes , that is when @xmath74 .",
    "writing @xmath75 for the _ gradient space _ @xmath76 , the convex conjugate @xmath71 of @xmath34 is the function @xmath77 defined by @xmath78 .",
    "it follows from legendre transformation that _ any _ bregman divergence @xmath7 admits a _ dual _ bregman divergence @xmath79 related to @xmath7 as follows : @xmath80 . using the convex conjugation twice ,",
    "we get the following ( dual ) theorem for the left - type bregman centroid :    the left - type sided bregman centroid @xmath23 , defined as the minimizer for the average left divergence @xmath81 , is the unique point @xmath82 such that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the center of mass for the gradient point set @xmath85 .    using the dual bregman divergence",
    "@xmath79 induced by the convex conjugate @xmath86 of @xmath34 , we observe that the left - type centroid @xmath87 is obtained _ equivalently _ by minimizing the dual right - type centroid problem on the gradient point set : @xmath88 , where we recall that @xmath89 and @xmath90 denote the gradient point set . thus the left - type bregman centroid @xmath23 is computed as the _ reciprocal gradient _ of the center of mass of the gradient point set @xmath91 : @xmath92 .",
    "it follows that the left - type bregman centroid is _",
    "unique_.    observe that the duality also proves that the information radius for the left - type centroid is the _ same _ @xmath34-jensen difference ( jensen - shannon divergence for the convex entropic function @xmath34 ) .",
    "the information radius equality @xmath93 is the @xmath34-jensen - shannon divergence for the uniform weight distribution .",
    "we show that both sided centroids are generalized means also called quasi - arithmetic or @xmath16-means .",
    "we first recall the basic definition of generalized means that generalizes the usual arithmetic and geometric means . for a _ strictly continuous _ and _ monotonous _ function @xmath16 , the _",
    "generalized mean _",
    "@xcite of a sequence @xmath94 of @xmath43 real numbers @xmath95 is defined as @xmath96 .",
    "the generalized means include the pythagoras arithmetic , geometric , and harmonic means , obtained respectively for functions @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( see appendix  [ appendix : sided ] ) .",
    "note that since @xmath16 is injective , its reciprocal function @xmath100 is properly defined .",
    "further , since @xmath16 is monotonous , it is noticed that the generalized mean is necessarily bounded between the _ extremal set _",
    "elements @xmath101 and @xmath102 : @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , finding these minimum and maximum set elements can be treated themselves as a special generalized power mean , another generalized mean for @xmath104 in the limit case @xmath105 .",
    "these generalized means highlight a bijection : bregman divergence @xmath106-means .",
    "the one - to - one mapping holds because bregman generator functions @xmath34 are strictly convex and differentiable functions chosen up to an affine term  @xcite . this affine invariant property _",
    "transposes _ to generalized means as an offset / scaling invariant property : @xmath107 .",
    "although we have considered centroids for simplicity ( ie . , uniform weight distribution on the input set @xmath42 ) , this approach generalizes straightforwardly to _ barycenters _ defined as solutions of minimum average optimization problems for arbitrary unit weight vector @xmath108 ( @xmath109 with @xmath110 ) :    bregman divergences are in bijection with generalized means .",
    "the right - type barycenter @xmath111 is independent of @xmath34 and computed as the weighted arithmetic mean on the point set , a generalized mean for the identity function : @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",

    "the information radius of sided barycenters is @xmath116 .",
    "for asymmetric bregman divergences , the symmetrized bregman centroid is defined by the following optimization problem @xmath117 .",
    "we simplify this optimization problem to another _ constant - size _ system relying only the right - type and left - type sided centroids , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "this will prove that the symmetrized bregman centroid is uniquely defined as the zeroing argument of a sided centroid function by generalizing the approach of veldhuis  @xcite that studied the _ special case _ of the symmetrized discrete kullback - leibler divergence , also known as @xmath36-divergence .",
    "we have previously shown that the right - type average divergence can be rewritten as @xmath120 .",
    "using legendre transformation , we have similarly @xmath121 . but @xmath122 since @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 from legendre duality . combining these two sum averages",
