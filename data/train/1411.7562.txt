    "considerable advances@xcite have been made in our understanding of the mechanism of dynamical tunneling .",
    "it is now well established that dynamical tunneling is extremely sensitive to the classical phase space structures . in particular , for systems in the mixed regular - chaotic regimes , the role of the nonlinear resonances resulting in resonance - assisted tunneling ( rat)@xcite and the influence of the chaotic sea leading to the phenomenon of chaos - assisted tunneling ( cat)@xcite have been studied in great detail .",

    "in this work we have shown that bichromatic control of dynamical tunneling can be compromised due to the presence of delocalized floquet states in the classical phase space .",
    "in essence , participation of the floquet states delocalized in the chaotic regions of the phase space results in chaos - assisted tunneling which is robust despite breaking of the symmetries upon addition of a second field . since the present work deals with the control of dynamical tunneling , a quantum process with no classical limit",

    "nevertheless , it remains to be seen as to whether chaos - assisted tunneling can reduce the efficiency or significantly modify the mechanism of control based on the principle of interference of optically induced pathways@xcite .",
    "moreover , our analysis suggests that such a loss of bichromatic control can potentially influence current rectification in driven systems .",
    "an earlier study@xcite by gong and brumer has also hinted at the possibility of reduced directed currents in hamiltonian ratchets due to dynamical tunneling between a chaotic sea and and transporting islands embedded in the chaotic sea .",
    "however , further detailed studies are required in order to clearly establish the role of chaos - assisted tunneling in ratcheting systems with@xcite and without dissipation . in the latter case",
    ", the role of hierarchical states@xcite in both control of dynamical tunneling and generation of directed transport needs to be explored further .",
    "note that one possible explanation for the  pillars \" of no control being reduced to  dust \" in the @xmath104 limit may be related to the fact that the fraction of hierarchical states goes to zero in this limit .    as a final note we point to an interesting parallel@xcite between bichromatically driven multilevel systems and the problem of molecular alignment and orientation on a plane .",
    "assuming that the present analysis can be extended to this observation , our work hints at the possibility that for certain values of the orienting dc field and a range of aligning field strengths , irrespective of the angle between the two fields , coherent control should be ineffective ."
