    "astigmatism is a well known aberration in folded optical cavities that include brewster - cut crystals and/or off - axis focusing elements @xcite . for continuous - wave ( cw ) operation , astigmatism is linear and can be fully compensated by correctly choosing the folding angles of the focusing elements in accordance with the length of the brewster - cut windows @xcite .",
    "this results in a circular non - astigmatic beam at the output of the laser . for mode - locked ( ml ) operation induced by the nonlinear kerr effect",
    ", an additional nonlinear astigmatism from the kerr lens is added that is power - dependent and needs to be taken into account .",
    "the standard technique to compensate for nonlinear astigmatism , is to deliberately introduce linear astigmatism in the `` opposite '' direction @xcite , which results in compensation of the overall astigmatism for a specific intra - cavity intensity .",
    "changing any of the cavity parameters that affect the intra - cavity intensity will require recompensation .",
    "here we demonstrate a novel type of cavity folding that eliminates from the source nonlinear astigmatism in kerr - lens ml lasers .",
    "let us first review shortly the standard design of a ml tis cavity , illustrated in fig.[standardfolding ] .",
    "the focusing mirrors are tilted with respect to the beam propagation axis , forming an x - fold ( or z - fold ) cavity keeping the laser beam propagation parallel to the optical table . in this configuration ,",
    "the astigmatism of the brewster - cut crystal compensates for astigmatism of the curved mirrors .",
    "the most important parameter for analyzing ml cavities is the strength of the kerr effect defined as @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the intra - cavity peak power , @xmath2 is the mode radius at the oc for a given distance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the critical power for catastrophic self - focusing @xcite . from eq.[gamma ] it follows that the kerr lens strength is represented by the change of the mode size on the oc due to a small increase in the intra - cavity peak power .",
    "this dependence of the mode size is due to the self - focusing effect caused by the intensity dependent refractive index of the crystal : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the zero order and second order refractive indices respectively @xcite , and @xmath9 is the mode area .    to determine the working point for ml we define @xmath10 as the distance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 with respect to an arbitrary reference point .",
    "two separate bands of @xmath10 values @xmath11,\\ [ \\delta_{3},\\delta_{4}]$ ] allow stable cw operation of the cavity @xcite .",
    "these two stability zones are bounded by four stability limits ( @xmath12 ) , each one requires different angle values to compensate for linear astigmatism in cw operation .",
    "astigmatic cavities are usually analyzed by splitting the cavity into tangential and sagittal planes , where both stable cw solution and @xmath13 are calculated for each plane separately .",
    "we note that while for cw operation the uncoupled resonators calculation is quantitatively accurate , it is only qualitatively relevant for mode - locked operation since the sagittal and tangential planes are coupled as the beam propagates through the kerr medium @xcite and the change of the beam size in one plane affects the lens strength also in the other plane . as we show hereon , this coupling is effectively nulled in the novel cavity folding , making the uncoupled resonators calculation quantitatively accurate .",
    "it was shown @xcite that @xmath14 is maximized close to the cavity stability limits .",
    "we therefore calculated @xmath14 using the transformed complex beam parameter method presented by @xcite near the second stability limit @xmath15 at a position corresponding to a beam size with a typical diameter of @xmath16 .",
    "calculations are performed within the aberration free kerr lens approximation , in which the transverse variation of the refractive index is approximated to be parabolic , so that the beam maintains its gaussian shape during the propagation and abcd method to analyse the cavity can be applied .",
    "figure [ gammaforstandardfolding ] plots the normalized @xmath14 of the sagittal and tangential planes for the standard cavity folding as a function of the crystal position @xmath17 .",
    "the folding angles were chosen so that linear cw astigmatism is compensated resulting in a circular cw beam on the oc . as the beam refracts into the crystal at brewster angle , the mode size in the tangential plane increases by a factor of @xmath18 whereas in the sagittal plane it does not change . since @xmath14 depends on the strength of self - focusing , which in turn depends on the intra - cavity intensity @xmath19 , a different mode size in each plane will cause a difference in the self - focusing strength , thus resulting in an astigmatic kerr lens .",
    "it is clear that a linearly compensated cw beam will not remain circular after ml .",
    "for this reason , cavities that produce circular beams in ml operation require the initial cw beam to be deliberately astigmatic so that the plane with the stronger @xmath14 will `` catch up '' with the weaker one @xcite .",
    "however , a solution that turns an astigmatic cw beam to a non - astigmatic ml beam exists only for a specific value of the intensity @xmath19 .",
    "any change in parameters that keeps the cw astigmatism compensated but affects the intra - cavity intensity ( peak power or mode size in the crystal ) will require a change in the folding angles to match the precise cw astigmatism needed to converge into a non - astigmatic ml beam .",
    "this includes a change in : pump power , pump focusing , output coupler , short arm length and also @xmath17 or @xmath10 .",
    "another disadvantage of the standard folding is that for long crystals , only a small fraction of the crystal contributes to the ml process , deteriorating the overall pump - mode overlap and affecting the laser efficiency and robustness .",
    "here we demonstrate a different type of cavity folding which allows the introduction of a planar - cut ( non - brewster ) crystal where the laser beam enters the crystal at normal incidence . in this configuration ,",
    "the curved mirrors compensate for the astigmatism of each other instead of the crystal , and the spatial mode of the beam in both planes does not change as it enters the crystal , thus cancelling the nonlinear kerr - lens astigmatism from the source .",
    "fig.[novelconfiguration ] illustrates the laser configuration .",
    "mirror @xmath3 folds the beam in - plane of the optical table , whereas @xmath4 folds the beam upwards .",
    "thus , the sagittal and tangential components of @xmath3 exchange roles at @xmath4 leading to exact cancellation of the linear astigmatism of one mirror by the other mirror . note that the polarization of the laser is unaffected by the new folding , which interchanges the primary axes , but does not mix them .",
    "the normalized kerr - lens strength for this configuration is plotted in fig.[gammafornovelfolding ] for the same @xmath10 as in the standard folding ( other cavity parameters remain unchanged ) .",
    "it is clear that the kerr - lens strength of each plane is equal with a small separation between the curves of each plane due to the non - zero value of the angles , taken to be @xmath20 , the minimal value possible with the opto - mechanical mounts in our experiment .",
    "we note that in this configuration , the mirrors astigmatism is uncoupled from the astigmatism of the brewster - cut windows . in order to completely compensate for linear astigmatism , the slight astigmatism from the brewster - cut prism - pair",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "thus , equal folding angles will compensate for astigmatism only when the beam is collimated in both arms ( at @xmath21 ) . for @xmath15 however , equal angles can still be maintained using the prisms astigmatism to compensate for the residual mirrors astigmatism at @xmath15 by correctly choosing the overall propagation length inside the prisms .",
    "experimentally , it was critical to slightly tilt the crystal so that reflections from its surface will not interrupt the ml process .",
    "we measured that for ml to operate , the minimal incidence angle of the laser beam at the crystal surface was @xmath22 which causes a slight increase in the tangential mode size inside the crystal , thus resulting in a negligibly small nonlinear astigmatism . to estimate the nonlinear astigmatic effect due to the crystal tilting angle , we compare the decrease in the tangential optical path in the crystal with respect to that of the sagittal being @xmath23 .",
    "using abcd matrices @xcite , the decrease factor in the tangential plane for brewster angle can be calculated to be @xmath24 , while for @xmath25 , this factor becomes @xmath26 and can be completely neglected .",
    "the cavity was mode locked using pump power of @xmath27 focused to a diameter of @xmath28 in the gain medium ( @xmath29 long , @xmath30 wt@xmath31 doped ) with an oc of @xmath32 .",
    "a prism pair of bk7 glass with @xmath33 separation was used for dispersion compensation .",
    "the cavity produced @xmath34 of pulse output power with spectral bandwidth of @xmath35 .",
    "we note that the pulse bandwidth is not fully optimized and broader bandwidths can be achieved with better dispersion compensation .",
    "figure [ spatialmodes ] plots the intensity profile of the cw and ml beams in the near field and for the ml beam also in the far field as measured by a ccd camera . for the near field ,",
    "the cw astigmatism ( defined as the ratio between the radius of the sagittal ( @xmath36 ) and tangential ( @xmath37 ) components ) was fitted to be @xmath38 , in good agreement to our prediction and the beam has an average radius of @xmath39 .",
    "as expected , the ml astigmatism remains exactly the same with an average beam radius of @xmath40 .",
    "the focusing quality of the ml mode was measured in the far field showing a beam quality factor of @xmath41 .",
    "we note that using a planar cut crystal reduces the mode size inside the crystal compared to a brewster - cut crystal , since the beam does not expand in one dimension upon refraction into the crystal .",
    "this can reduce the laser threshold and increase the pulse output power compared to a standard cavity folding of similar parameters .",
    "in addition , the reduced mode size enhances the nonlinear kerr lensing compared to brewster - cut crystals leading to an increased mode locking strength . the large difference in beam size between the ml and cw modes ( fig.[spatialmodes ] )",
    "is a result of the improved kerr strength , demonstrating the higher efficiency of the kerr nonlinear mechanism in this design .",
    "to conclude , we demonstrated a cavity design that in the first place needs no compensation for nonlinear astigmatism .",
    "in addition , the range of the crystal position in which both sagittal and tangential components contribute for the ml process is increased , resulting in a simple robust configuration for mode - locked lasers ."
