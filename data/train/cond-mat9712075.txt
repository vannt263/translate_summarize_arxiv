    "magnetic junctions made up of fully saturated ferromagnets have attracted a great deal of attention , as they may lead to large magnetoresistance at low fields .",
    "this effect should be particularly enhanced in fully polarized magnets@xcite .",
    "the tunneling probability between two fully polarized electrodes whose magnetization are at a relative angle @xmath4 goes like @xmath5 . by averaging this quantity , we find that the conductance in the absence of an applied field , when @xmath4 can have any value , is one half of the conductance in the presence of a field , which aligns the magnetization and makes @xmath6 .",
    "this simple analysis predicts that the maximum allowed magnetoresistance is 100% .",
    "this upper bound remains to be achieved in experiments , although enhanced effects have been reported in different experimental setups@xcite .",
    "spin tunneling is also expected to be dominant in transport through ceramics and granular systems , where enhanced magnetoresistance at low fields has also been reported@xcite .",
    "the relevance of magnetic scattering at the interface in perovskite manganites can also be inferred by comparing with transport in related materials which exhibit colossal magnetoresistance@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we study various effects which may limit the observed magnetoresistance .",
    "the bound discussed above assumes that the transmitted electron has a well defined spin throughout the tunneling process .",
    "if the spin can flip as the electron hops from one electrode to the other , the observed magnetoresistance will be reduced with respect to the previous value .",
    "thus , we shall consider processes which change the spin of the electron as it tunnels .    in the following section , we analyze the role of magnetic impurities which may be present in the interface region . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that they are magnetic ions of the same type as those which exist in the bulk of the electrodes , that is , mn or cr .",
    "the third section studies spin flip processes which involve the excitation of bulk magnons during the tunneling process .    in the fourth section ,",
    "we consider the possibility that the interface has different magnetic properties than the bulk@xcite .",
    "in particular , we analyze the influence of an antiferomagnetic layer at the interface , which may be present if it is oxidized , for instance .",
    "the fifth section analyzes the main consequences of coulomb blockade on spin polarized tunneling .",
    "coulomb blockade requires large charging energies , and small dimensions .",
    "it can be relevant to transport in granular materials .",
    "the main conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "the current between the electrodes may arise from direct electron transfer , or by processes in which electrons hop into impurity levels within the barrier between the electrodes .",
    "if the impurities are magnetic , these processes can change the spin of the electron , and modify the observed magnetoresistance .",
    "we will mostly assume that the contribution of magnetic impurities to the total current , although at the end of the present section some comments are made on the features to be found in the opposite limit .",
    "we consider impurities , such as mn@xmath7 , mn@xmath8 , cr@xmath7 and cr@xmath8 of the same kind as the ions present in the electrodes .",
    "these impurities have electronic levels at energies within the conduction band of the electrodes",
    ". electrons , or holes , can hop from one electrode into these levels , and from there to the other electrode ( see fig .",
    "( [ imp ] ) ) .",
    "we assume that the hund s coupling between these electrodes and the core spins is much larger than any other scale in the problem .",
    "thus , the hopping process only involves the highest spin state of the ion .    at zero temperature",
    ", an electron ( or hole ) which is initially polarized in the direction of the magnetization of one electrode has a finite amplitude of hopping into the impurity . in a basis aligned with the impurity spin ,",
    "the initial state of the impurity is @xmath9 .",
    "after an electron hops from the left electrode , it becomes : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the relative angle between the magnetization of the left electrode and the initial spin of the impurity .",
    "we are projecting out intermediate states where the spin of the impurity is not maximum .",
    "let us now assume that the same electron hops coherently into the right electrode .",
    "the spin of the electron must be parallel to the magnetization of the right electrode .",
    "the direction of the magnetization forms an angle @xmath12 with respect to the spin of the impurity , and an azimuthal angle @xmath13 with respect to the plane formed by the impurity spin and the magnetization of the right electrode .",
    "then , the final state of the impurity is : @xmath14     \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\theta_{li}}{2 } \\right )     \\cos \\left ( \\frac{\\theta_{ir}}{2 } \\right ) } { 2 s + 1 }    that the impurity can accept an electron , as for mn@xmath8 .",
    "a hole current , in the opposite direction , can take place through ions like mn@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding calculation is straightforward , except that the angles are interchanged .",
    "finally , the probability that an electron hops between the two electrodes after a process like the one described above is : @xmath15 ^ 2   \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{2 s}{(2 s + 1)^2 } \\langle   \\sin^2 \\left ( \\frac{\\theta_{li}}{2 } \\right )     \\cos^2 \\left ( \\frac{\\theta_{ir}}{2 }",
    "\\right )   \\rangle \\label{transmission}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the brackets denote thermal averages over the values of the angles @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the case",
    "that the direction of the impurity spin is totally random , we find that @xmath16 . for @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "this value increases in an applied field , as the impurities tend to be aligned by it .",
    "the corrections can be obtained by performing the averages in ( [ transmission ] ) in the presence of a field .",
    "expanding , we find : @xmath19    by comparing the tranmission with and without a field , we find that the contribution of impurity scattering can be included into the magnetoresistance as : @xmath20 } \\label{mrimp}\\ ] ] this expression is valid to lowest order in @xmath21 . in this expression",
    ", @xmath22 stands for all contributions to the conductance other than those due to the impurities , and @xmath23 is the conductance due to impurities at zero field .",
    "the magnetoresistance , when scattering by magnetic impurities is allowed , is reduced by a factor proportional to @xmath24 , and it is temperature independent at low fields .",
    "as these processes are elastic , they do not induce a dependence on applied voltage .",
    "the crossover between the low and the high field regime takes place when @xmath25 . if @xmath17 and @xmath26k , this field is 60 t , while for @xmath27k , the field is 0.8 t .",
    "the corresponding figures for @xmath28 impurities are 180 t and 2.4 t .",
    "finally , if most of the current was due to resonant tunneling through magnetic impurities , the observed magnetoresistance will increase , instead of decreasing as in the previous case .",
    "a magnetic filed will align the spin of the impurities with the magnetization of the electrodes .",
    "the impurities behave in a similar way to a third magnetic layer located between the electrodes . for instance",
    ", the current which flows from tunneling through @xmath17 impurity levels whose magnetic moments are oriented at random is @xmath29 that of the current when the moments are aligned by a field .",
    "the corresponding figure for tunneling between magnetic electrodes is @xmath30 . a possible situation where of the current in a magnetic junction is due to sequential ( not resonant ) tunneling through impurity levels",
    "is reported in@xcite .",
    "the spin of the tunneling electron can be changed by the creation , or absorption , of magnons in the electrodes .",
    "these processes increase the tunneling probability between electrodes whose magnetization is not aligned , and reduce the observed magnetoresistance .",
    "we will consider that the rate of magnon induced tunneling is independent of the relative angle between the magnetization in each electrode .",
    "if the barrier width if of length @xmath31 , the electron , after a tunneling event , will be spread in a region of size @xmath31 in the electrode it has hopped to .",
    "we write the electron creation operator as @xmath32 , in terms of a spinless fermion , @xmath33 , and a schwinger boson of spin @xmath34 , @xmath35@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath36 gives the spatial extent of the wavefunction of the electron after the tunneling process , @xmath37 , the thickness of the barrier . by expanding these operators into the normal modes of the electrodes",
    ", we find that , roughly , all magnons , @xmath38 with wavelengths larger than @xmath31 can be created with equal probability .    at zero temperature only magnon creation is allowed .",
    "this is possible at finite junction voltages .",
    "an electron with energy @xmath39 above the chemical potential of the other electrode can create any magnon with energy @xmath40 , provided that the wavelength of the magnon , @xmath41 is less than @xmath31 ( @xmath42 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "the density of states of magnons in a ferromagnetic three dimensional system is @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the intensity due to magnon creation is : @xmath44 } d \\epsilon ' \\frac{1}{j } \\left ( \\frac{\\epsilon ' } { j } \\right)^ { \\frac{1}{2 } }   \\nonumber \\\\ &",
    "\\sim   & \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{lr } \\frac{v}{r } \\left ( \\frac{v}{j } \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2 } }   & v \\ll j \\frac{a^2}{d^2 } \\\\ \\frac{v}{r } \\left ( \\frac{a}{d } \\right)^3    & v \\gg j \\frac{a^2}{d^2 } \\end{array } \\right . \\label{magnonv } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this contribution is to be added to the elastic conductance , @xmath45 .",
    "we assume that magnon induced tunneling is independent of the relative angle between the magnetization in the two electrodes .",
    "hence , the term shown in ( [ magnonv ] ) reduces the magnetoresistance at finite voltages .    at finite temperatures , the electrons which tunnel can excite magnons of energy below @xmath46 . using the previous argument",
    ", the probability that an electron excites a magnon goes as @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the differential conductivity at low voltages has a contribution which goes as : @xmath48 this term increases the conductance of the junction , and it is independent of the relative orientation of the magnetization of the electrodes .",
    "hence , the observed magnetoresistance decreases , as @xmath49 increases , as @xmath50 .",
    "this contribution has the same temperature dependence as the reduction of the magnetoresistance due to the decrease in the magnetization of the electrodes .",
    "the latter effect , however , does not give rise to non linear i - v characteristics .",
    "it is likely that , in doped manganites or in cro@xmath51 , the surface has a different composition than the bulk .",
    "in addition , the double exchange mechanism is weaker at a surface , as the kinetic energy of the carriers is reduced .",
    "both effects may reduce the tendency towards ferromagnetism , leading to antiferromagnetic behavior . note that a change in the magnetic structure of the surface leads to modifications in the height of the tunneling barrier .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that a simple dependence of the height of the barrier on the magnetic surface energy can be found@xcite .",
    "the contribution of spin flip processes due to interface antiferromagnons can be estimated in the same way as in the preceding section .",
    "the only difference is the change in the density of states , due to the different dispersion relation , and to the low dimensionality . for two dimensional antiferromagnons ,",
    "this quantity is @xmath52 .",
    "the highest energy plasmon which can couple to the tunneling electron has energy @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the intensity depends on voltage as : @xmath54 and , at finite temperatures , we find a contribution to the conductivity like : @xmath55 as in the previous case , this effect reduces the observed magnetoresistance at finite temperatures . if @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the contribution of processes mediated by magnons is comparable to the purely elastic conductance . in this limit",
    ", the magnetoresistance should tend to zero .",
    "it has been argued that , in tunnel junctions based on co , ferromagnetic magnons are localized at the interface@xcite .",
    "the scheme used here can be appplied to this case . by inserting the appropiate density of states",
    ", we recover the results reported in@xcite .",
    "coulomb blockade reduces the conductance of granular systems at low temperatures@xcite . the charging energy required to add one electron to a grain , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the capacitance of the grain , is not negligible .",
    "it tends to open a gap when @xmath60 .",
    "the main process which suppresses this gap , at low temperatures , is inelastic cotunneling@xcite . at finite temperatures or voltages ,",
    "one electron can hop into a grain and leave it on a time scale shorter than @xmath61 , leaving an excited electron - hole pair of energy @xmath62 .",
    "a sketch of the process is depicted in fig.([cotunn ] ) .",
    "cotunneling gives a conductance which goes as @xmath63 .",
    "this estimate is valid when a single small grain inserted between much larger grains blocks the current . if we consider @xmath64 grains in series , the conductance due to cotunneling goes like @xmath65 .",
    "a sketch of the process is depicted in fig.([cotunn ] ) .",
    "cotunneling requires two correlated hopping processes . in a fully polarized magnet ,",
    "each hopping is reduced by a factor proportional to @xmath66 , where @xmath4 is the angle between the magnetization in thea central grain and that in the right or the left grains . averaging over orientations ,",
    "cotunneling is reduced by a factor @xmath67 , when the magnetizations are at random .",
    "the corresponding value for @xmath64 grains of small capacitance is @xmath68 .",
    "this factor becomes 1 when a magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the grains .",
    "hence , cotunneling is more sensitive to magnetic disorder that direct tunneling .",
    "the magnetoresistance should increase when coulomb blockade supresses direct tunneling , and only cotunneling is allowed .",
    "note that this effect is only important at very low temperatures , when activated processes over the coulomb barrier are negligible .",
    "it should also be absent in magnetic junctions where the electrodes are not fully polarized@xcite .",
    "sufficiently small grains , however , will behave like non resonant ( because of the coulomb gap ) magnetic impurities .",
    "hence , tunneling between misorented grains is not totally suppressed , as discussed in section ( ii ) .",
    "this gives a limit to the maximum achievable magnetoresistance .",
    "in addition , the resistance of @xmath64 small grains in series can be so large , @xmath69 , that the magnetoresistance can not be observed .    at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "when the contribution from cotunneling is small , the existence of a coulomb gap leads to activated transport . in the presence of magnetic disorder ,",
    "the activation energy also includes a contribution from spin flip processes , which must take place during the tunneling event@xcite .",
    "this energy goes like the average magnon energy excited in the tunneling process , as discussed in section ( iii ) , @xmath70 .",
    "if we assume that all intergrain junctions are identical , this effect leads to a magnetoresistance which should increase as @xmath71 .",
    "this process , however , is limited by cotunneling at low temperatures .",
    "spin flip processes reduce the magnetoresistance of junctions between fully polarized magnets . their origin may be extrinsic , related to the different magnetic properties of the interfaces , or intrinsic , associated to the excitation of bulk magnons .",
    "in addition , they can be classified into elastic , as the scattering by magnetic impurities , or inelastic , which are mediated by magnetic excitations .",
    "elastic spin flip processes can due to magnetic impurities or other static deviations from perfect ferromagnetism , like domain walls@xcite .",
    "they are extrinsic , as they should not be present in perfect systems .",
    "they give rise to a temperature independent reduction of the magnetoresistance .",
    "assuming that the scattering by these imperfections leads to a loss of the spin orientation of the electron , the relative reduction in the magnetoresistance goes as @xmath24 , where @xmath23 is the contribution to the conductance from resonant tunneling via impurity states , and @xmath22 stands for the conductance due to other tunnel processes .",
    "inelastic spin flip processes do not reduce the magnetoresistance at zero temperature and zero voltage , but give rise to non ohmic effects at finite voltages , and to changes in the conductance as function of temperature .",
    "we can distinguish between intrinsic effects , mediated by bulk magnons , and those related to magnetic excitations of the interface .",
    "bulk magnons reduce the magnetoresistance at temperatures , or voltages , comparable to the bulk exchange coupling , which is of the order of the curie temperature .",
    "the effect due to interface excitations shows up at the scale of the new couplings at the interface . in this work ,",
    "we have considered the influence of an antiferromagnetic layer at the interface , but more complicated excitations may exist if the surface is strongly disordered .    finally , we have analyzed the interplay of spin polarized tunneling and coulomb blockade .",
    "we find that cotunneling processes enhance the magnetoresistance .",
    "this effect may be difficult to observe , due to the high resistance of junctions at the temperature when coulomb blockade is fully developed .",
