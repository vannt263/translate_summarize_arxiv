    "the goal of the present paper is to present a new approach to the construction of asymptotic ( approximating ) solutions to parabolic pde by using the characteristics .",
    "this approach allows one to construct global in time solutions not only for the usual cauchy problems but also for the inverse problems . we will work with kolmogorov  feller - type equations with diffusion , potential , and jump terms",
    "the equation under study has the form : @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the symbol of the kolmogorov ",
    "feller operator , @xmath3 is a small parameter characterizing the frequency and the amplitude of jumps of the markov stochastic process with transition probability given by @xmath2 . to be more precise ,",
    "we bear in the mind the following form of @xmath2 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a positive smooth matrix , @xmath6 is a family of positive bounded measures smooth with respect to @xmath7 such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are smooth in @xmath7 ( more precise conditions see below ) .",
    "the construction of forward in time global asymptotic solution to equations of this type was developed by v.  maslov , @xcite , for a version of this construction , see also in @xcite .",
    "maslov s approach is based on ideas similar to those used in his famous canonical operator construction ( or in fourier integral operators theory ) .",
    "this construction is based on some integral representation and is not suitable for constructing backward in time solutions .",
    "another approach to the global asymptotic solution construction was suggested in @xcite and is based on the construction of generalized solutions to continuity equation in a discontinuous velocity field  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the class of solutions under study admits the following limits :    \\(1 )  logarithmic pointwise limit @xmath11 .",
    "we denote this limit by @xmath12 and assume that it is a piecewise smooth function with bounded first - order derivatives and a singular support in the form of a stratified manifold  @xmath13 .",
    "\\(2 )  weak limit of the expression @xmath14 .",
    "we denoted it by @xmath15 and assume that @xmath15 is the sum of the function ( @xmath16 ) smooth outside  @xmath13 and the dirac @xmath17-function on @xmath13 .",
    "note that here we deal with the limit in the weighted weak sense !",
    "if @xmath18 and @xmath15 are smooth function , then the following representation is true ( in the usual sense ) @xmath19    * example 1 : *    @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a smooth function , @xmath22 .    here",
    "a wkb - like approach can be used ( yu .  kifer ,  @xcite ; v.  maslov ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it gives an asymptotic ( approximating ) solution in the form ( cf .",

    "jacobi equation @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the solution to the transport equation @xmath28 @xmath29 both of the solutions @xmath18 and @xmath30 are defined via solutions of the hamilton system @xmath31    they are smooth while @xmath32    there are symplectic geometry objects corresponding to this construction :    \\(1 ) the phase space @xmath33 ;    \\(2 ) the lagrangian manifold @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a shift mapping along the hamiltonian system trajectories ;    \\(3 ) the projection mapping @xmath38 with jacobi matrix @xmath39 .",
    "the main assumption that is required is the following one .",
    "the trajectories of the hamilton system form a manifold of the phase space ( at least in the area of the phase space under study ) .",
    "let @xmath40 for @xmath41 $ ] , then we have the following statement ( v.  maslov ,  @xcite ; v.  danilov , @xcite ) :    the inequality @xmath42 is necessary and sufficient for the following estimation to hold : @xmath43 where @xmath44 as @xmath45 and the function @xmath18 is a solution to the hamilton ",

    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    one can see that in the case under study there are three values of @xmath18 at the point @xmath59 .",
    "this means that we can present an asymptotic solution near this point in the form of a linear combination : @xmath60 where each of the functions @xmath61 , @xmath62 , satisfies the equation with the same accuracy .",
    "but the functions themselves are not equivalent in contrast to the hyperbolic case .",
    "for example , it is clear that if the inequality @xmath63 holds at a certain point @xmath59 , then the `` wkb '' solutions @xmath64 and @xmath65 at the point @xmath59 satisfy the relation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an arbitrary number .",
    "this follows from the fact that the difference @xmath68 in parentheses in the exponent is positive .",
    "thus , at each point in formula , it is necessary to choose the term where the function @xmath69 is minimal .",
    "such a choice leads to an expression of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear that expression is the leading term of the approximate solution .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian manifold is the following one :        the vertical line position is such that the above - mentioned squares are equal .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the one - dimensional case , there is a direct connection between the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation @xmath72 and the conservation law of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 and the velocity of the vertical line is defined by rankine  hugoniot condition corresponding to the conservation law .",
    "if the lagrangian manifold has a jump , then the corresponding value function @xmath75 has a jump in the first derivative .",
    "assumption of the actual analyticity for all objects provides that there is no `` concentration of singularities '' ,  each one can be considered separately in a sense and one can construct a value function as a solution of the hamilton  jacobi  bellman equation .    what about the amplitude function ?",
    "as was mentioned above , it is a solution of the transport equation @xmath76    generally , the velocity field calculated from the hamilton system has a jump simultaneously with a jump in @xmath77 ( and then in @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , the problem ( still open ! ) is to solve the transport equation in a discontinuous velocity field .",
    "we avoid this problem considering the squared solution of the transport equation @xmath79 .",
    "madelung ,  @xcite ( about 100 years ago ! ) observed that it satisfies the continuity equation @xmath80 in the smooth case .",
    "our case is more complicated : we again have a discontinuity velocity field .",
    "there are few approaches to this problem solution : the theory of measure solutions ( f.  murat , p.  lefloh , b.  hayes , t.  zang , y.  zheng et al . , @xcite ) , the box approximation ( m.  oberguggenberger , m.  nedelkov , @xcite ) , the weak asymptotics method ( v.  danilov , v.  shelkovich , @xcite ) , the generalized characteristics method ( v.  danilov , d.mitrovich and v.  danilov , @xcite ) .",
    "the last allows one to construct a solution to the continuity equation in the case where a singular support of the velocity field is a stratified manifold with smooth strata which are transversal to the ( incoming ! ) trajectories of the velocity field .",
    "if for some time interval @xmath81 $ ] , the singular support of the velocity field preserves its structure ( the mapping of the singular support induced by the shift along the hamilton flow is a diffeomorphism ) , then it is possible to show that the singular support of the velocity has the required structure .",
    "if the structure is changing ( e.g. , a jump appears , see fig.5 and fig.4-the last step of evolution in time ) , then one can use the weak asymptotics method to construct a global solution to the hamilton  jacobi and continuity equations .",
    "this approach is based on a `` new ( generalized ) characteristics '' constructed by v.  danilov and d.  mitrovic , @xcite in the case where the strata of the singular support are of codimension  1 .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to consider the singularity origination as a result of nonlinear solitary wave interaction .",
    "a simple example is the hamilton flow corresponding to the heat equation from the previous example . the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation in this case is equivalent to the hopf equation for the momentum @xmath82 : @xmath83    the solution in this case has the form @xmath84 and is plotted below .",
    ", width=377 ]    to consider @xmath85 , we have to calculate the product @xmath86 here the following equality holds : @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an arbitrary small parameter and @xmath90 is a small quantity in the sense of distributions , @xmath91 for each @xmath92 , which is a test function .",
    "the time evolution of the function @xmath82 is such that the slanting intercept of a straight line preserves its shape until it takes the vertical position and then a jump begins to propagate .",
    "this means that , at every time instant , the solution anzatz can be presented in the form of a linear combination of heaviside functions .",
    "this allows one to use a formula which express the product of heaviside functions as their linear combination , and hence , uniformly in time , we see that the functions @xmath82 and @xmath85 ( the last up to a small quantity ) belong to the same linear space , for detail , see @xcite .",
    "thus , we can prove the following theorem .",
    "assume that the following conditions are satisfied for @xmath93 $ ] , @xmath94 :    \\(1 ) there exists a smooth solution of the hamiltonian system ,    \\(2 ) the singularities of the velocity field @xmath95 form a stratified manifold with smooth strata and @xmath96 .",
    "then there exists a generalized solution @xmath15 of the cauchy problem for continuity equation in the sense of the integral identity introduced in @xcite and at the points where the projection @xmath97 is bijective , the asymptotic solution of the cauchy problem for kolmogorov - feller type equation has the form @xmath98",
    "as was shown above , all that we need to go forward in time is the hamilton system : @xmath99 @xmath100    let us change the time direction as @xmath101 , then @xmath102 @xmath103 we want to solve the inverse problem : @xmath104 the right - hand sides are considered as given data , and we are looking for @xmath105 , @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "obviously , in our case the solutions have the form @xmath108 conclusion : we can use the `` same '' trajectories to move forward and backward in time .",
    "but the incoming trajectories become outcoming and vice versa .",
    "but if there are no jumps ( singularities of the projection mapping @xmath109 ) , then our geometry ( and the asymptotic solution ! ) is invertible in time .",
    "this means that if we take the cauchy problem solution @xmath110 for parabolic pde such that @xmath111 then the asymptotic solution for @xmath112 has the `` wkb '' form @xmath113 then taking the last function as the initial data for parabolic pde in inverse time ( let @xmath114 be its asymptotic solution ) , we get : @xmath115 it can be easily verified in the case @xmath116 i.e. for simplest heat equation .",
    "if one constructs the solution of inverse heat equation with initial data at @xmath112 of the form @xmath117 using the green function and calculates the integral be saddle point method at @xmath118then the following result will be obtained @xmath119 we want to stress once again that this statement is true if there is no singularities of projection mapping @xmath120 .",
    "there is no unique reconstruction of the part of lagrangian manifold coming to the vertical line as @xmath55 increases ( see fig.9 ) ! but , fortunately , we can move ahead using the sense considerations .",
    "the main point is that the function @xmath18 can not attain its minimum ( maximum ) inside the `` terra incognita '' .",
    "this allows one to calculate the integrals containing the reconstructed solution without taking `` terra incognita '' into account in the case where the integrand support contains this `` terra incognita '' , and we can formulate the following statement .",
    "let the symbol @xmath2 defined by   be such that the function @xmath9 and measure @xmath89 do not depend on @xmath7 and @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath122 be a solution of the cauchy problem to a kolmogorov  feller - type equation , and assume that , for some @xmath123 , there exists a logarithmic limit @xmath124 , namely , the action function and the generalized amplitude @xmath125 .            1 .",
    "let @xmath136 , then relation ( [ alpha1 ] ) is true ; 2 .",
    "assume that @xmath137 , @xmath133 is a union of segments @xmath138 , and the intersection between some @xmath139 and @xmath140 is not empty but @xmath139 does not belong to @xmath133 , then the limit of the integral as @xmath127 @xmath141 equals  @xmath129 , where @xmath142 is the minimal value of @xmath18 at the ends of @xmath139 .",
    "these statements actually mean that , from the viewpoint of the weak sense ( momentum ) , the density reconstructed arbitrarily inside the `` terra incognita '' and according to the characteristics outside it can be used in the same manner as the leading term of the asymptotic solution constructed earlier by maslov s tunnel canonical operator and its modifications , @xcite .",
    "now i will briefly speak about the proofs of the statements about the invertibility in time that was formulated above .",
    "each of them can be divided into two parts .",
    "first , it is to prove that , for all smooth reconstructions of lagrangian manifold in a `` terra incognita '' domain , the corresponding function @xmath143 ( for some fixed @xmath55 ) can not attain its minimum value inside this domain , see the lemma below .",
    "this allows one to apply the laplace method for calculating the integrals mentioned in those statements taking into account that , due to this method and lemma , the results of these calculations do not depend on the values of the integrands inside the `` terra incognita '' domain .",
    "the proof is finished by taking account of the estimation @xmath144 which is true outside the singular support of the function @xmath18 , see theorem above .",
    "now i formulate the lemma .",
    "let the symbol @xmath2 defined by   be such that the function @xmath9 and the measure @xmath89 do not depend on @xmath7 and @xmath121 .",
    "then the function @xmath18 , i.e. , the action function corresponding to the lagrangian manifold , can not attain the minimal value inside the `` terra incognita '' domains .",
    "we begin the consideration with a particular case when operator symbol @xmath2 does not depend on @xmath7 and restrict ourselves by one dimensional case studying .",
    "let ( a , b ) is an interval inside the `` terra incognita '' domain , and let @xmath145 .",
    "we will proceed by contradiction .",
    "assume that the function @xmath18 attain its minimal value at the point @xmath145 .",
    "we prove that , along the trajectory of hamilton system whose projection starts at @xmath145 , the following inequality is true : @xmath146 this inequality leads to a contradiction because of the assumption that @xmath147 belongs to the `` terra incognita '' domain , and hence it belongs to the projection of the image of the singular ( vertical ) part of the lagrangian manifold under backward in time shift along the trajectories of the hamilton system . in turn",
    ", this means that the projections of all trajectories whose starting points are projected to the `` terra incognita '' must intersect at a point for the forward in time motion .",
    "so the above - mentioned inequality leads to a contradiction . to prove this inequality , we write the projection of the hamilton system trajectory starting at @xmath147 .",
    "it has the form @xmath148 it is clear that @xmath149 .",
    "thus , @xmath150 taking into account that that @xmath151 because of the convexity of @xmath152 and @xmath153 due to the assumption that @xmath147 is a point of minimal value , we get the needed inequality  .",
    "a multidimensional case differs from the case considered by changing the scalar values @xmath154 and @xmath155 by vectors ( gradients ) . in turn",
    ", this gives matrix inequalities in   and  .",
    "the problem is to prove that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath156 are nonnegative by using   and  .",
    "for this , we can make a change of variables reducing the matrix @xmath157 to diagonal form .",
    "this transformation induces the corresponding transformation in the @xmath82-plane that transforms the matrix @xmath158 to a new symmetric positive matrix .",
    "now we note that the principal minors of the new matrix product are products of matrix - factor principal minors ( because the second one is of diagonal form ) .",
    "the determinants of the matrix - factor principal minors are nonnegative , so the spectrum of the matrix @xmath156 is also nonnegative and we again get  .",
    "to finish our consideration , we have to investigate the case where the symbol @xmath47 depends on @xmath7",
    ". we again stay at the point @xmath147 , where the function @xmath159 attains its minimum .",
    "if so , then @xmath160 and , by assumptions , @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "the system for the matrices @xmath163 and @xmath164 follows from the hamilton system and has the form @xmath165 @xmath166 because of our assumptions ( see the lemma formulation ) , we have @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "this means that , along the hamilton system trajectory starting from the point @xmath170 , @xmath161 , we have @xmath161 and @xmath171 .",
    "thus , along the above - mentioned trajectory , equations   and   have the form @xmath172 @xmath173 integrating over @xmath55 , we can transform the first equation to the form of eq .   and apply all above arguments concerning this equality .",
    "thus we came to the relation with the same properties as .",
    "one can proceed further and generalize the statement to the case of an arbitrary drift .",
