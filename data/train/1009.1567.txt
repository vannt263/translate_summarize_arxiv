    "a central problem in cryptography is the distribution among distant users of secret keys that can be used , e.g. , for the secure encryption of messages .",
    "this task is impossible in classical cryptography unless assumptions are made on the computational power of the eavesdropper .",
    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , on the other hand , offers security against adversaries with unbounded computing power @xcite .",
    "the ultimate level of security provided by qkd was made possible thanks to a change of paradigm . while in classical cryptography security relies on the hardness of certain mathematical problems , in qkd it relies on the fundamental laws of quantum physics .",
    "a side - effect of this change of paradigm , however , is that whereas the security of classical cryptography is based on the mathematical properties of the key itself  how the key was actually generated in practice being , in principle , irrelevant to the security of the scheme  in qkd , the security crucially depends on the physical properties of the key generation process , e.g. , on the fact that the key was produced by measuring the polarization of a single - photon along well defined directions .",
    "but then , how can one asses the level of security provided by a real - life implementation of qkd , which will inevitably differs in inconspicuous ways from the idealized , theoretical description  @xcite ? errors in the encoding of the signals of alice  @xcite , for instance , or features of the detectors not taken into account in the theoretical analysis  @xcite can be exploited to break the security of real - life qkd schemes",
    ".    device - independent qkd ( diqkd )  @xcite aims at closing the gap between theoretical analyses and practical realizations of qkd by designing protocols whose security does not require a detailed characterization of the devices used to generate the secret key ( such as , e.g. , the dimension of the hilbert space of the quantum signals or the type of measurements performed on them )  @xcite",
    ". this stronger form of cryptography is possible if it is based on the observation of a bell inequality violation , which guarantees that the data produced by the quantum devices possess some amount of secrecy , independently of how exactly these data were generated  @xcite . in some sense , diqkd combines the advantages of classical and quantum cryptography : security against unbounded adversaries based on the law of quantum physics but which does not rely on the physical details of the generation process . a fully device - independent demonstration of qkd , however , still represents at present an experimental challenge  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we provide a general formalism for proving the security of diqkd protocols .",
    "the key element in our analysis is a bound on the min - entropy of the raw key as a function of the observed bell inequality violation .",
    "compared to the security proof given in  @xcite , which is restricted to protocols based on the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality  @xcite , our approach is completely general and can be applied to protocols based on arbitrary bell inequalities .",
    "furthermore , it is not limited to `` collective attacks '' , but is valid against the most general attacks available to an eavesdropper .",
    "the diqkd model that we consider , however , is partly restricted as it supposes that the measurement processes generating the different bits of the raw key are causally independent of each other ( though they could be arbitrarily correlated ) .",
    "this independence condition is necessarily satisfied in a physical realization where the @xmath0 bits of the raw key are generated by @xmath0 separate pairs of devices used in parallel .",
    "our analysis therefore shows that secure fully device - independent qkd is in principle possible . in a more practical realization in which a single pair of devices is used sequentially to generate the raw key",
    ", our measurement independence condition is satisfied if the devices have no internal memory , an assumption that may be justifiable in a variety of implementations .",
    "note that our measurement independence condition and the level of security provided here is equivalent to the one considered in @xcite .",
    "the difference with respect to @xcite is that our proof does not rely only on the no - signalling principle but also on the validity of the quantum formalism .",
    "this results in much better key rates , comparable to those of standard qkd .",
    "let us start by presenting the class of protocols that we consider here , which are variations of ekert s qkd protocol  @xcite .",
    "alice and bob share a quantum channel that distributes entangled states and they both have a quantum apparatus to measure their incoming particles .",
    "these apparatuses take an input ( the measurement setting ) and produce an output ( the measurement outcome ) .",
    "we label the inputs and outputs @xmath1 and @xmath2 for alice , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 for bob , and assume that they take a finite set of possible values .",
    "the first step of the protocol consists in measuring the pairs of quantum systems distributed to alice and bob . in most of the cases ( say @xmath0 ) , the inputs are set to fixed values @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the corresponding outputs @xmath7 and @xmath8 constitute the two versions of the raw key . in the remaining systems , which represent a small random subset of all measured pairs ( of size say @xmath9 ) , the inputs @xmath10 are chosen uniformly at random . from these @xmath11 pairs , alice and bob",
    "determine the relative frequencies @xmath12 with which the outputs @xmath2 and @xmath4 are obtained when using inputs @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "these relative frequencies quantify the degree of non - local correlations between alice and bob s system through the violation of the bell inequality associated to the diqkd protocol .",
    "this bell inequality is defined by a linear function @xmath13 of the input - output correlations @xmath12 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the coefficients defining the bell inequality and @xmath16 is its local bound .",
    "a particular example of a bell inequality is the chsh inequality  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "after this initial `` measure and estimate '' phase , the rest of the protocol is similar to any other qkd protocol .",
    "alice publishes an @xmath19-bit message about @xmath20 , which is used by bob to correct his errors @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 with arbitrarily high probability .",
    "alice and bob then generate their final secret key @xmath23 by applying a 2-universal random function to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively @xcite .",
    "in the diqkd approach , we do not assume that the devices behave according to predetermined specifications .",
    "for instance , the state emitted by the source of particles may be modified by the eavesdropper , or the implementation of the measuring devices may be imperfect . to analyze the security of a diqkd protocol , we must therefore first specify how we model the @xmath0 pairs of systems used to generate the raw key .",
    "these @xmath0 pairs of systems are eventually all measured using the inputs @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but since they where initially selected at random and each of them could have been part of the @xmath11 pairs used to estimate the bell violation , we must also consider what would have happened for any other inputs @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "let therefore @xmath28 denote the prior probability to obtain outcomes @xmath29 and @xmath30 if measurements @xmath31 and @xmath32 are made on these @xmath0 pairs .",
    "this unknown probability distribution characterizes the initial system at the beginning of the protocol .    in the theoretical model that we consider here",
    ", we view the @xmath0 bits of the raw key as arising from @xmath0 _ commuting _ measurements on a joint quantum system @xmath33 .",

    "the only constraint on them is that they should return measurement probabilities compatible with the statistics of the @xmath11 randomly selected pairs , characterized by the observed bell - inequality violation @xmath13 .    in quantum theory ,",
    "measurement operators that commute represent compatible measurements that do not influence each other and which can be performed independently of each other .",
    "the commutation relations between the operators @xmath36 describing alice s measurement devices and the operators @xmath41 describing bob s measurement devices are thus a necessary part of any diqkd model ; security can not be guaranteed without them .",
    "the commutation relations between the operators @xmath36 _ within _ alice s location , and the commutation relations between the operators @xmath41 _ within _ bob s location , represent , on the other hand , additional constraints specific to the diqkd model considered here .",
    "these commutation relations are satisfied in an implementation in which the @xmath0 bits of the raw key are generated by @xmath0 separate and non - interacting pairs of devices used in parallel .    in the extreme adversarial scenario where the provider of the devices is not trusted ( e.g. , if the provider is the eavesdropper itself ) , this independence condition can be guaranteed by shielding the @xmath0 devices in such a way that no communication between them occurs during the measurement process .",
    "one could also consider a setup where the measurements performed by the @xmath0 devices define space - like separated events .",
    "however , even in a space - like separated configuration , the ability to shield the devices is required if the provider of the devices is untrusted , as we can not guarantee through other means that the devices do not send directly unwanted information to the adversary .",
    "but , then , the ability to shield the devices is already sufficient by itself to guarantee .    in a more practical implementation where the raw key is generated by repeatedly performing measurements in sequence on a _ single _ pair of devices ,",
    "the commutation relation expresses the condition that the functioning of the devices should not depend on any internal memory storing the quantum states and measurement results obtained in previous rounds . in the most general diqkd model",
    ", the quantum devices could possess a quantum memory such that the state of the system after the @xmath37 measurement is passed to the successive round @xmath47 ( this state could also contain classical information about the measurement inputs and outputs of step @xmath48 ) .",
    "if @xmath49 denotes the state of the system before measurement @xmath48 , the unormalised state passed to round @xmath47 in the event that alice and bob use inputs @xmath38 and @xmath50 and obtain outputs @xmath51 and @xmath52 would then be @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are generalized measurement operators describing alice s and bob s measurements and satisfying @xmath56 .",

    "we now establish a bound on the secret key rate that can be achieved against an unrestricted eavesdropper eve for a qkd protocol satisfying the description , , .",
    "the information available to eve can be represented by a quantum system that is correlated with the systems of alice and bob .",

    "this state describes the @xmath64 systems at the beginning of the protocol .",

    "we have shown how to compute a bound on the key rate of a large class of diqkd protocols .",
    "our approach is based on a fundamental relation between the amount by which two quantum systems violate a bell inequality and the unpredictability of their local measurement outcomes , as illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "a similar relation has been used in the context of device - independent randomness generation  @xcite .    to derive our security proof ,",

    "admittedly , a realization requiring @xmath0 different devices for the generation of @xmath0 raw - key symbols is impractical .",
    "our results nevertheless show that secure fully device - independent qdk with key rates comparable to those of traditional qkd is in principle possible .    in a more realistic implementation",
    ", the raw key is generated by repeatedly performing measurements on a single pair of devices .",
    "in such a sequential implementation , the description provided by eqs . and corresponds to the assumption that the functioning of the measuring devices does not depend on an internal memory storing the quantum states and measurement results obtained at previous steps . while it would be desirable to extend our security proof to cover such possible memory effects , it may be reasonable to expect our no - memory condition to be satisfied in a variety of practical setups .",
    "after all , this no - memory condition is assumed in standard qkd , where the description of the devices fits in the formalism of eqs .",
    "but while we make here no assumptions at all on the measurement operators @xmath36 , @xmath41 ( nor on the hilbert spaces on which they are defined ) , in standard qkd one assumes that these measuring operators have a fixed and known value , which is identical for all @xmath48  an idealized assumption difficult to verify in practice . from this perspective , the diqkd model considered here clearly represents a _ relaxation _ of standard qkd , and thus can only be more secure .",
    "note that the no - memory assumption allows for devices whose behaviour may vary with time ( as implied by the dependence of @xmath155 on the subindex @xmath48 ) , it only excludes , e.g. , that the response of the devices at step @xmath156 depends on the particular measurement input at step @xmath157 .",
    "such kind of memory effects could arguably be excluded , for instance if no explicit memory has been introduced in the devices or if an  initialization \" procedure is performed before every measurement based on an estimation of the apparatus memory characteristics",

    "<S> we provide a general security proof valid for a large class of device - independent quantum key distribution protocols in a model in which the raw key elements are generated by causally independent measurement processes </S>",
    "<S> . the validity of this independence condition may be justifiable in a variety of implementations and is necessarily satisfied in a physical realization where the raw key is generated by @xmath0 separate pairs of devices . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows that device - independent quantum key distribution is possible with key rates comparable to those of standard schemes . </S>"
