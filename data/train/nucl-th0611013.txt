    "in spite of the progress that has taken place over the years on the solution of the three - nucleon scattering problem in terms of ab initio calculations , there are still some open problems that defy our understanding .",
    "they are the @xmath2 puzzle in elastic @xmath4 scattering and the space star anomaly in @xmath4 breakup , just to name a few .",
    "these problems persist even when the coulomb interaction is added @xcite and seem to be insensitive to the choice of realistic @xmath5 force model .",
    "as it has already been highlighted in the past @xcite , the four - nucleon scattering problem reveals further discrepancies between theory and experiment that need clarification in terms of improved calculations using modern force models and efficient numerical algorithms that allow for a numerically converged solution of the alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) equation @xcite for the transition operators .    in four - nucleon scattering",
    "the coulomb interaction is paramount to treat @xmath1 , to separate the @xmath6 threshold from @xmath7 and at the same time avoid a second excited state of the alpha particle a few kev bellow the lowest scattering threshold @xcite .",
    "given the success recently achieved in including the coulomb interaction in @xmath8 elastic scattering and breakup @xcite , we generalize the proposed method to the four - nucleon system and study @xmath1 below three - body breakup threshold .",
    "the work we present here constitutes the first effort to design and construct a new scattering code that may bring the treatment of the four - nucleon system to the same degree of accuracy and sophistication as we already have in the three - nucleon system .",
    "the symmetrized ags equations for four identical nucleons are given by    [ eq : u11e21 ] @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the transition operator for @xmath11 , @xmath12 the @xmath3 t - matrix and @xmath13 the four free particle green s function .",
    "the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively @xmath16 and @xmath17 subsystem transition operators given by    [ eq : uetildeu ] @xmath18    where the permutation operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "defining @xmath23 and @xmath24 the initial / final @xmath25 and @xmath26 states that satisfy the equations    [ eq : phi1e2 ] @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 lead to the transition amplitudes from which one calculates observables .",
    "after partial wave decomposition we solve a three - variable integral equation with no approximations beyond the usual discretization of continuous variables in a finite mesh .",
    "in order to calibrate the accuracy of our new numerical algorithm we calculate first the negative eigenvalues of the kernel that correspond to the @xmath30 binding energy . the coulomb interaction is included through screening and charge dependence in the @xmath3 interaction taken in isospin @xmath31 alone . in table 1",
    "we show the convergence of the results for the binding energy in terms of two - nucleon total angular momentum @xmath32 .",
