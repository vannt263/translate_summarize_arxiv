    "by providing a non - perturbative definition of quantum gravity , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite allows , in principle , for a complete quantum description of black holes . in practice ,",
    "detailed computations are possible only in supersymmetric cases . unfortunately , there are no genuine black hole solutions , with a macroscopic horizon , in the 1/2 ,  1/4 , or 1/8-bps sectors . in the 1/16-bps sector ,",
    "supersymmetric asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes were constructed in @xcite , as solutions to five - dimensional gauged supergravity .",
    "these supersymmetric black holes are charged and rotating , and , surprisingly , they constitute only a co dimension one surface of the space of extremal black holes .",
    "the quantum description of these black holes is possible via the cft , which is strongly coupled in the regime of interest , and , for that , supersymmetry might be of use .",
    "a bps operator sits in a short multiplet , and its dimension is fixed by the bps condition .",
    "the size of a multiplet can not be deformed when continuously changing the parameters of a theory ( specifically the couplings ) , and accordingly the dimension of such operators is protected against quantum correction .",
    "a caveat occurs if two short multiplets are joined together to form a longer one @xcite , but this is not always possible @xcite .",
    "when short multiplets can not join to form a longer multiplet , the bps operator is called protected and its dimension is un - renormalized . in this case",
    "it is kept bps in the strong coupling regime , if it is computed to be so at weak coupling , and certain results can be extrapolated from weak to strong coupling .",
    "there is no construction of exactly 1/16-bps operators in @xmath3 sym , so far , and in particular it is not known whether these operators ( or some of them ) are protected .",
    "the identification of the 1/16-bps operators will allow for a study of black holes from a microscopic point of view , and for example , with this knowledge at hand one may be able of understanding the appearance of classical horizons from the classical limit of quantum states .",
    "this is the long term motivation for our study .",
    "some first steps towards understanding the @xmath4-bps sector of @xmath1 sym have been taken in @xcite , in the context of ads / cft .",
    "the large black - hole limit , in which the dual black hole mass is dominated by angular momenta , was explored , and a suggested construction for highest weight primary operators was put forward . the constructed operators satisfy the 1/16-bps formula , at tree - level , and were conjectured in @xcite to be primaries , up to addition of descendants .",
    "the main ingredient for the 1/16-bps construction was a fermi - sea of @xmath1 gauginos , which was filled up ( in a gauge invariant way ) by their angular momenta , up to some level .",
    "to the gauginos fermi - sea an additional family of bosonic structures was added ( in order to satisfy the exact 1/16-bps equation ) , and altogether the final class of operators reproduced the correct entropy and angular - momentum - to - charge scaling , as predicted by the corresponding black hole solution , up to order one coefficients .",
    "it was explained in @xcite that their construction can be generalized with some other bosonic structures over the fermi - sea ` core ' , to give additional 1/16-bps operators , and thus the mismatch between the numerical coefficients was not a surprise .    in the construction of @xcite",
    "the fermi - sea structure was essential for the operator to be supersymmetric .",
    "the action of a specific supercharge on any ` parton ' in the fermi - sea was shown to annihilate the parton into two other partons , which were already included in the sea , thus leading to the annihilation of the whole fermi - sea operator by that supercharge .",
    "later , the ` naked ' fermi - sea operators ( with no additional structure ) were also shown to be weakly renormalized to 2-loop order @xcite , with their anomalous dimension suppressed by the fermi - level .",
    "we expect that this fermi - sea structure would be essential for any improvement of the model of @xcite ( that will give the exact counting , for example ) , and accordingly we look for a robust prediction of these fermi - sea operators on the theory .",
    "interestingly , such operators have a very sharp signal , which is the level of the fermi - surface ; the existence of the fermi - surface is indeed insensitive to modifications of these operators in the bosonic sector .",
    "if the fermi - sea model for minimally supersymmetric operators is correct , then a similar indication should be found on the gravity side as well .    having this expectation in mind we consider in this work the 1/16-bps black hole , and study trajectories of classical test - particle whirling around it .",
    "we analyze these geodesics as a function of the particle s energy , charge and angular momentum ( per unit of mass ) .",
    "we find this analysis to be sensitive to the fermi - level of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec:1/16bh ] by summarizing some facts about 1/16-bps black holes @xcite . in section [ sec:1/16operators ]",
    "we summarize the suggested initial construction of 1/16-bps operators in @xmath1 sym @xcite . in section [ sec : schwarz ] we warm up by working out a simpler example , analyzing the geodesic trajectories of a classical test - particle around the schwarzschild black hole in @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ sec : fermi - surface ] , in which we present our main result , we work out a geodesic analysis in the metric of the 1/16-bps black hole of @xcite , and find a clear probe for the fermi - level of the suggested operators of @xcite .",
    "the first supersymmetric , asymptotically @xmath0 , black hole solutions were constructed in @xcite . these formed a 1-parameter family of solutions of minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity .",
    "@xcite . they can also be embedded into an @xmath5 gauged supergravity with @xmath6 gauge symmetry ; the solution of @xcite is then lifted to a solution of three equal charges . ]",
    "these black holes were found to be charged and rotating , and to preserve 1/16 of the supersymmetries .",
    "later on these solution were generalized in @xcite , but we will focus here on the special case of @xcite , with their notations .",
    "the black hole solution of @xcite carries one charge and a single angular momentum on the @xmath7 in @xmath0 , say @xmath8 .",
    "the second angular momentum was put to zero , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the angular momenta on two orthogonal 2-planes . even though the bps formula should only reduce , generically , one of the remaining free parameters , m , j and q , the solutions of @xcite were found to contain , surprisingly , only a one parameter family of solutions .",

    "finally , @xmath14 is the radius of the ads , and the @xmath15 s used above are right invariant 1-forms on @xmath16 , which can be expressed in terms of euler angles ( @xmath17 ) as : @xmath18 the maxwell potential is @xmath19~. \\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ] the black hole horizon is situated at @xmath20 and is not spherical , but instead has the shape of a squashed sphere .",
    "the original isometry group of @xmath0 is broken by the black hole angular momentum into a subgroup @xmath21 .",
    "recall , however , that far away from the horizon , since the metric approaches those of @xmath0 , the spherical symmetry @xmath22 is restored .",
    "this coordinate system is convenient to work with , but it does nt have the standard @xmath0 asymptotics , so comparisons with the cft needs to be considered carefully . to make the @xmath0 asymptotics manifest , a change of coordinates is introduced , @xmath23 the metric is then @xmath24~,\\ ] ] and the maxwell potential is @xmath25~ , \\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 ~,{\\notag}\\\\   h(r)&=1-\\frac{r_0 ^ 2}{r^2}-\\frac{r_0 ^ 2}{2r^4}~.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in section [ sec : fermi - surface ] we present our main computation in the former coordinate system ( which makes things simpler ) , and",
    "will then take care for the needed translation from the gravity conserved charges to the cft ones , due to this coordinate transformation .",
    "we mention , however , that in order to verify our computation ( which is rather technical ) we have proceeded with both coordinate systems and obtained equivalent results .      the mass , angular momentum and charge of the black hole",
    "are : @xmath27 these saturate the 1/16-bps bound , , and here we define @xmath28 , consistently with @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath29 everywhere in this work the classical gravity limit is being assumed , that is the large n and large t hooft coupling limit in the field theory . from now on we also set @xmath30 .",
    "we are also working in the very large mass limit @xmath31 , and in the limit where @xmath32 , in which the charge and angular momentum of the black hole were shown @xcite to satisfy the following relation , @xmath33 comparing this with the form of @xcite , we see the black hole charge and angular momentum can also be written as @xmath34 where we have also defined @xmath35 for later convenience .",
    "this form will be most natural for comparison with the field theory predictions .",
    "the scaling relation was obtained in @xcite by the fermi - sea construction , but with @xmath36 replacing @xmath37 . mismatch .",
    "] one possibility for this mismatch is that the angular momentum of the fermi - sea operator is smaller than that of the black hole by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "we will see in the sequel that this is exactly the option that is consistent with our results .",
    "the primary motivation for the current study is the identification of all 1/16-bps operators in @xmath1 sym . a starting point in this program",
    "was taken in @xcite , where a family of operators that satisfy the 1/16-bps formula @xcite , at tree level , was constructed .",
    "the operators were shown to satisfy the correct angular momentum to r - charge scaling relation , as found in the gravity solution , up to an order one coefficient .",
    "while these operators were not fully proven to be primaries , some arguments indicating they can not be written as descendants of primaries were sketched .",
    "thus , @xcite made the conjecture that these operators are primaries , up to the addition of a descendant . when counting them , they have been found to give the correct bekenstein - hawking entropy , again up to an order one coefficient . in this section",
    "we briefly review the essential ingredients in the work of @xcite , trying to emphasize the fermi - sea element of the construction . to keep the flow of the paper we try to avoid technical details as much as possible , and we send the reader to @xcite for the full details of their work .",
    "the field content of @xmath1 sym includes the chiral and anti - chiral parts of the gauge boson field strength ( @xmath39 ) , the four weyl spinor gauginos ( @xmath40 ) , and six real scalars , which can also be packed within six complex scalars ( @xmath41 ) , obeying the reality condition @xmath42 .",
    "here , undotted @xmath43 , dotted @xmath44 greek indices and latin @xmath45 indices stand for @xmath46 symmetry indices , respectively .",
    "the theory is invariant under the @xmath1 supersymmetry transformations of the schematic form @xmath47~,~~\\delta f \\sim id\\lambda - id \\bar \\lambda   ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 stands for the covariant derivative .",
    "this theory also admits a bosonic symmetry , including the conformal group in 4d minkowski space @xmath49 and the @xmath50 r - symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1 superconformal representations are classified by six numbers , the conformal dimension ( @xmath51 ) , the @xmath22 angular momenta on the @xmath7 in @xmath0 ( @xmath52 ) , and the dynkin labels of the @xmath50 representation ( @xmath53 $ ] ) . in ( semi-)short representations ,",
    "the conformal dimension is determined by the other numbers , and the short representation is denoted by @xmath54_{j,\\,\\bar j}~.\\ ] ] the relation of the dynkin labels to the @xmath50 charges which were written in the gravity is : @xmath55 our case in the gravity @xcite is the one with @xmath28 , which corresponds here to @xmath56 .    in @xcite a detailed analysis of short and semi - short representations of the @xmath1 superconformal group",
    "was carried out .",
    "in particular , a 1/16-bps representation ( denoted @xmath57 ) was found ; in this representation , the superconformal primary operator , in addition to be annihilated by all the conformal supercharges , is also annihilated by a single additional combination out of the sixteen poincar supercharges , @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for the lowering operator in @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the supercharge generators .",
    "further , the conformal dimension @xmath51 of these superconformal primary operators was found to obey the 1/16-bps formula : @xmath62 when relating this to the bps formula in the gravity ( using the @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 dictionary ) , we discern a difference of factor 2 . however , this additive factor is unobservable in the regime we are working , where the charges are generically very large to ensure a reliable classical spacetime description .",
    "one of the key observation in @xcite was to identify some remarkable properties of the fermionic operator , denoted by @xmath65 , that is built up from the action of @xmath66 covariant derivatives on a gaugino .",
    "schematically it is written as @xmath67 where @xmath65 has angular momenta @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this operator features three important properties .",
    "the first is its supersymmetry transformation , schematically written , @xmath70 this means that the supersymmetry action on @xmath71 splits it into two @xmath71 s , which always have lower angular momenta than the original one . secondly , its dimension satisfies the 1/16-bps formula , apart from its ` global ' part of an additive factor of @xmath72 , @xmath73= 2j+\\frac{3}{2}k[a^{(i)}]+p[a^{(i)}]+\\frac{1}{2}q[a^{(i)}]=\\delta^{(c^{1/4})}[a^{(i)}]-2~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thirdly , while its r - charge is fixed , its angular momenta grow linearly with @xmath66 .",
    "the authors of @xcite have used the above first property to construct a fermi - sea out of these @xmath71-operators , by multiplying all @xmath71-operators up to some left angular momentum level @xmath74 .",
    "this is done in a gauge invariant way , @xmath75~ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76=\\epsilon_{a_1a_2 ... a_g}x^{a_1}x^{a_2} ... x^{a_g}~~,~~x=\\sum_{a=1}^{n^2 - 1 } x^a t^a~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath77 is an @xmath78 highest weight operator .",
    "notice that @xmath79 generates also the multiplication of the entire @xmath80 multiplet , and thus makes the right angular momentum to vanish , @xmath32 .",
    "the fermionic building block of the fermi - sea operator , the @xmath71 s , are referred to as ` partons ' . the angular momentum and charge of these fermi - sea operators",
    "were also computed at the large @xmath81 and large @xmath74 limit @xcite : @xmath82 this can be seen to almost satisfy , up to a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "we see that the relation of the fermi - level and the black - hole parameter is @xmath83 up to an order one coefficient . _",
    "if the previous mismatch from is completely due to the value of @xmath84 _ , than we find that simply @xmath85",
    ". we will find this possibility to be in a very good agreement with our results .",
    "the fermi level of left angular momentum is then @xmath86 .",
    "the fermi - sea operator enjoys some desired features , as well as some repairable faults :    * it is annihilated by two supercharges .",
    "the relevant supercharges split each fermionic parton into two new fermionic partons which are already in the fermi - sea , and thus by the pauli exclusion principle the whole fermi - sea operator is annihilated by those supercharges .",
    "this still calls for a remedy , as the final operator needs to be annihilated by a single supercharge only . *",
    "the fermi - sea operator satisfies the 1/16-bps formula , apart from the factor @xmath72 global part , at weak coupling , by just adding the quantum numbers of all partons in the sea .",
    "this still needs to be added an operator with dimension @xmath72 . * in the large @xmath74 limit , which is equivalent to the large mass limit in the supergravity , the fermi - sea operator has an angular momentum which is much larger than its r - charge , and it was shown in @xcite to exactly reproduce the correct scaling behavior , up to an order one multiplicative factor .",
    "another fault of the ` naked ' fermi - sea operator is that it is so far unique , for a given total angular momentum , and still degeneracy needs to be introduced into this picture , in order to generate the desired entropy .",
    "it turned out @xcite that by introducing additional bosonic structure ( with tree - level dimension @xmath72 ) , to be multiplied with the ` naked ' fermi - sea operator , all above faults were apparently fixed .",
    "the 1/16-bps formula was exactly satisfied ; the degeneracies were introduced , and the computed entropy agreed with the supergravity prediction , again , up to an order one coefficient .",
    "finally , the operator was argued to be a genuine primary , up to an addition of a descendent .",
    "here we have described the case of @xmath32 , which is the case of our interest , but also the case of @xmath87 has been worked out in @xcite .",
    "we consider a classical test particle in the @xmath0 schwarzschild background . the rotational symmetry @xmath88 constrains the motion of the particle onto a plane , which can be described then by a single angular momentum @xmath89 .",
    "the particle has also energy @xmath90 and a mass @xmath91 ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 are per unit of mass if the particle is massive ) . in this section",
    "we study the trajectories of the particle , classified by its constants - of - motion , according to whether or not it is falling into the black hole .",
    "it should be noted that while our particle either falls quickly or not at all , a real quantum particle has a wave function which is always leaking into the horizon .",
    "our classical particle is an appropriate limit for the case of very large quantum numbers , and we understand a ( non- ) falling classical particle as one which is endowed with a very ( slow ) fast decaying wave function .",
    "the metric of a schwarzschild black hole in @xmath0 is the following @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is the standard metric on the 3-sphere , @xmath95 in the coordinates of we choose the plane of motion to be at @xmath96 , so that the angular coordinate in the plane is @xmath97 . for every killing vector @xmath98 that satisfies the killing equation @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the general covariant derivative , there is a constant - of - motion for the particle s trajectory @xmath101 for the killing vectors @xmath102 and @xmath103 we find the energy and angular momentum : @xmath104 writing the equations - of - motion for a massive particle @xmath105 and putting in the definitions for @xmath90 and @xmath89 , we find for the radial coordinate an effective one - dimensional problem @xmath106 the effective potential and effective energy are : @xmath107    to understand whether or not the real particle is falling into the black hole , we need to analyze the effective potential structure to decide whether the effective particle ( with its effective energy @xmath108 ) will roll down to @xmath109 , or not .",
    "we work in the large black hole limit ( @xmath110 ) , in which the horizon is situated at @xmath111 .",
    "we define @xmath112 such that @xmath113 . for the effective particle not to fall all the way to @xmath109 we need to have a minimum @xmath114 and a maximum @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) . to have an extremum we need @xmath117 first we see that @xmath118 and @xmath119 are always positive , thus we must demand @xmath120 in order to have a minimum .",
    "this implies @xmath121 .",
    "looking at the generic graphs of @xmath122 separately , we see that @xmath123 generate a minimum which is shifted to the left by @xmath124 , while @xmath125 generate a maximum which is shifted to the right by @xmath126 . analyzing this",
    "accurately we find @xmath127 from which we get @xmath128 and derive the inequality @xmath129 from this we see that we can approximate @xmath130 when @xmath131 . thus , when looking back at the potential , and defining @xmath132 we get a simpler problem : @xmath133 for the particle not to fall we must have extrema of @xmath134 at @xmath135 , @xmath136 after replacing @xmath137 this amounts to @xmath138 + analyzing analytically this polynomial , we find that it has positive zeros if and only if @xmath139 and both of them always lies in front of the horizon . reducing it back to the original variables it comes to @xmath140 for the particle not to fall , we also need to demand a bound on the effective energy , @xmath141 and we find that this energy window narrows in the large @xmath142 limit , such that finally @xmath143    we have found sharp bounds on the particle s energy and angular momentum not to fall to the horizon . this can be interpreted as a robust probe for the black hole solution , and as such , a holographic construction of this black hole should be able of reproducing the same sharp signals .",
    "in this section we will perturb the 1/16-bps black hole solution by considering a classical particle moving around it . similarly to the previous section , we will reduce the problem to a one - dimensional effective problem for the radial direction , and will analyze the particle s trajectory according to its charge , energy and angular momentum .",
    "we will see that the analysis is very much sensitive to the level of the fermi - surface , which is predicted from the suggested construction of 1/16-bps operators in the cft .",
    "as the details of the computations are very technical , and not very illuminating , we will only quote here our steps and results .",
    "the black hole metric and maxwell potential are invariant under the @xmath80 right part of the original rotational symmetry , and in addition under an abelian subgroup of the left part @xmath144 , which are rotations of @xmath145 .",
    "we also have a symmetry for translations in time .",

    "the constants - of - motion associated with any killing vector @xmath148 , are @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the particle s charge per unit of mass . in this case",
    "the killing vector needs to satisfy a modified killing equation , depended both on the metric and on the electromagnetic potential . in the simplest case",
    "it satisfies both parts separately , @xmath151 as it is the case for the above killing vectors . using and in we find the constants - of - motion : @xmath152~ , { \\notag}\\\\ j_1^r & = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\left(4\\rho v + r^2\\lambda\\dot{\\phi}-4f^2\\psi\\dot{t}+ r^2(\\lambda-1)\\dot{\\psi}\\cos\\theta\\right)\\sin\\psi \\sin\\theta+r^2\\dot{\\theta}\\cos\\psi\\right]~ , { \\notag}\\\\   j_3^r & = \\frac{1}{4}\\left [ \\left(4\\rho v+ r^2\\lambda\\dot{\\phi}-4f^2\\psi\\dot{t}+r^2\\lambda\\dot{\\psi}\\cos\\theta\\right)\\cos\\theta   + r^2\\dot{\\psi}\\sin^2\\theta\\right]~ , { \\notag}\\\\   j^l_3 & =   \\frac{r^2\\lambda}{4 } \\left(\\dot{\\phi}+\\dot{\\psi}\\cos\\theta\\right)+\\rho v - f^2\\psi\\dot{t}~,{\\notag}\\\\   e & =   f^2\\left(\\dot{t}+\\psi(\\dot{\\phi}+\\dot{\\psi}\\cos\\theta)\\right)-\\rho f~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the modified charge @xmath153 .",
