    "inflation is an attractive paradigm for explaining small temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background , the distribution of galaxies , the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on scales of more than @xmath12  mpc and its spatial flatness , as inferred by recent wmap data  @xcite .",
    "the current standard model of cosmology somehow combines the original hot big bang model and the primordial inflation  @xcite , by virtue of the existence of a fundamental scalar field , called _",
    "inflaton_. however , the standard model of cosmology has some gaps and cracks ; for instance , the recently observed accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite appears to suggest in the fabric of the cosmos a self - repulsive dark energy component of magnitude about @xmath13 of the total energy budget of the entire universe .",
    "evidence in favour of this accelerated expansion has strengthened significantly as the result of further sne ia observations  @xcite , surveys of large scale structure  @xcite and improved measurements of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "the precise cause of this late - time acceleration and the nature of dark energy attributed to this effect , however , remain illusive .",
    "the phenomenal role of a cosmological vacuum energy ( or dark energy ) has changed our vocabulary for describing the cosmological possibilities and the fate of our universe ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "we do not understand whether the highly accelerated expansion shortly after the big - bang - called inflation and the current accelerated expansion of the universe ( caused by dark energy ) are related .",
    "understanding of dark energy s origin may be expected to provide some useful insights to many other puzzles in physics , including : what caused the early universe inflation ?",
    "why does dark energy / dark matter make up most of the universe ?    in a fundamental theory of gravity plus elementary particles and fields , it is quite plausible that the primordial inflation naturally led to have a dark energy effect in the conditions of concurrent universe , i.e. when the universe became much larger than its size at the beginning .",
    "such an effect can be explained through two somehow different mechanisms . in the first , and perhaps the most viable approach  @xcite",
    ", the present - day dark energy effect could be realized as a remnant of the original inflaton field that went into a hide shortly after reheating ( or even after inflation ) , but which started to play a new role during the matter dominated epoch , especially , on large cosmological scales ( @xmath14 mpc ) , where gravity would almost fail to curve the spacetime , thereby leading to a spatially flat friedmann - lamatre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe . in the second approach",
    ", the quantum fluctuations associated with an accelerating slice of a frw metric ( during the primordial inflation ) could gradually overtake at late times the ambient matter distributions , tending to increase the rate of expansion of the universe on large cosmological scales . in this paper",
    "we discuss about the latter possibility , in the framework of a model of  conformal \" dark energy ( dynamical dark energy measured by the conformal age of the universe ) recently proposed by cai and wei  @xcite .",
    "there has also been a fair amount of interest in the possibility that the dark energy is holographic  @xcite .",
    "the model of dynamical dark energy discussed in  @xcite has some similarities with the so - called holographic dark energy proposed earlier by li  @xcite",
    ". we will briefly comment at the end on holographic dark energy models .",
    "the possibility remains that the cosmological constant ( or the vacuum energy ) is fundamentally variable . in order to give the idea a fair hearing",
    ", one should conceivably take some sort of dark energy potential .",
    "an appropriate lagrangian might be @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inverse planck mass @xmath17 , @xmath18 is newton s constant , @xmath3 is a fundamental scalar ( or dark energy ) field and @xmath19 is its potential .",
    "indeed , in the simplest dynamical dark energy models  @xcite , dark energy is associated with the energy density of a scalar field with a canonical kinetic structure , as above .",
    "most dynamical dark energy models , including the  agegraphic \" ( actually , inverse age - mapping ) and holographic dark energy , may be analyzed by maintaining the above structure of the theory .",
    "for an analytic treatment it is necessary to evaluate the equations generated by variation of the action  ( [ action ] ) ; thus a particular choice of a metric has to be made . in line with current observations , and because it greatly simplifies the calculations , we make the rather standard choice of a spatially flat , homogeneous metric : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the scale factor of a spatially flat frw universe .",
    "this is consistent with the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and large - scale structures of the universe , which indicate that the present universe is spatially flat and homogeneous on large scales .",
    "an important ingredient of a cosmological model is matter lagrangian , which may be given by  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 m , r ) , @xmath25 .",
    "introduction of a fundamental scalar field @xmath3 , its potential @xmath19 and the coupling @xmath26 between @xmath3 and the ordinary matter ( @xmath27 ) and radiation ( @xmath28 ) may not be arbitrary rather a requirement for the present - day concordance model cosmology .",
    "these ingredients are strongly motivated by supergravity and superstring theories .",
    "einstein s equations following from eqs .",
    "( [ action ] ) and ( [ matter - scalar ] ) are  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath3 couples to the trace of the matter stress tensor , @xmath32 , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the hubble parameter ( the dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath36 ) . since @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the above equation of motion for @xmath3 can be expressed in the following form   defined here corresponds to @xmath39 in refs .",

    ".    the set of autonomous equations of motion may be given by ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath49 subject to the friedmann constraint @xmath50 , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath51 + { \\rm const}$ ] , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the fact that the radiation term @xmath28 does not contribute to the scalar potential or the klein - gordon equation has an interesting implication : in the early universe , e.g. during or shortly after inflation , one can ignore the coupling @xmath26 , since @xmath57 . during the matter - dominated universe ,",
    "given that @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , it is plausible that @xmath62 .",
    "however , the coupling @xmath7 may be relevant especially when @xmath63 , i.e. , in the dark energy - dominated universe .    from eq .",
    "( [ eom1 ] ) , we find that the dark energy equation of state is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( matter ) includes all forms of matter fields , such as , pressureless dust ( @xmath66 ) , stiff fluid ( @xmath67 ) , cosmic strings ( @xmath68 ) , domain walls ( @xmath69 ) , etc .",
    "one might also note the universe accelerates when the effective equation of state @xmath70 is less than @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ) , not when @xmath73 . in the particular case that @xmath74 and @xmath75 , so that the matter is approximated by a pressureless non - relativistic perfect fluid , the universe accelerates for @xmath76 with the input @xmath77",
    ", we can see that the universe accelerates for @xmath78 .",
    "we do not yet have any clue as to what dark energy is , and how to compute its present contribution from the first principles .",
    "a common lore is that  dark energy \" is the einstein s cosmological constant until proven otherwise , for the reason that it is the most economical interpretation of the data .",
    "the main observation that has led to this viewpoint is the following : the combination of wmap3 and supernova legacy survey data sets show a significant constraint on the dark energy equation of state , @xmath79 , on the @xmath80cdm model , i.e. , in a flat universe , with a prior @xmath81 .",
    "perhaps this observation is not yet sufficiently convincing to abandon other possibilities , at least , for two other reasons : firstly , no theoretical model , not even the most sophisticated , such as supersymmetry or string theory , is able to explain the presence of a small positive cosmological constant , in the amount that our observations require  @xcite , @xmath82 or @xmath83 in planck units ; secondly , there are widespread claims that the analysis of the type ia supernova data sets actually favour a time - varying dark energy equation of state at higher redshifts ( see , e.g.  @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "needless to emphasize , the possibility remains that dark energy is fundamentally variable .",
    "it is thus a fair approach to envisage for plausible phenomenological models and apply the observational results either to rule them all or select one of them . in order to give the idea a fair treatment , in this work",
    "we briefly review some recent attempts in this direction , namely , the models of conformal and  holographic \" dark energy .      in a recent proposal  @xcite , cai argued that the present - day dark energy density may be defined by the energy density of metric fluctuations in a minkowski spacetime , namely @xmath84 where the numerical coefficient @xmath85 and @xmath86 is planck s time . the above relation is somehow based on quantum kinematics or heisenberg uncertainty type relations that put a limit on the accuracy of quantum measurements ; we refer to the papers  @xcite and references therein , for further details . without any reference to the field potential @xmath19 , by eq .",
    "( [ quantum - de ] ) , one can perhaps understand that the quantum fluctuations in a minkowski spacetime contribute to the expectation value of the stress tensor in a way that mimics the dark energy density at the present epoch . according to  @xcite",

    "the wmap observations , which are sensitive to @xmath106 over a redshift range of roughly @xmath107 ( since decoupling ) , imply @xmath108 ( @xmath109 confidence level ) , which translates to the condition @xmath110 .",
    "this last condition obviously leads to a result consistent with the discussion in  @xcite , where the best fit values were found to be @xmath111 and @xmath112 in using the constraints from cmb and lss observations .    equating eqs .",

    "( [ t - h - relation1 ] ) , the obvious choices are @xmath119 , since during both matter and radiation dominated epochs @xmath120 .",
    "the requirements @xmath121 during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and @xmath122 during the matter - dominated universe therefore imply that @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "this result led us to conclude in  @xcite that the agegraphic dark energy with some fixed @xmath125 in ( [ quantum - de ] ) is not a viable alternative to concordance cosmology .",
    "it would be possible to modify this outcome only by dropping one or more premises of the standard model cosmology , such as , a matter - dominated flat universe did not exist , which then tells that the einstein - de sitter model is never realized truly . as an illustrative example , one may consider the following modification @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a constant with the dimension of time .",
    "in fact , a solution of the above structure arises in almost all scalar - tensor theories , e.g. , with @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in a standard approach",
    ", one normally sets @xmath130 using the coordinate parameterization freedom of @xmath36 , with the assumption that such a shift in time only changes the position of the big bang singularity . however , let us assume here rather implicitly that no freedom was left so as to allow us to set @xmath130 ; therefore , @xmath131 henceforth .",

    "the other obvious drawback of the conformal dark energy model is that it only provides a kinematic approach to dark energy , by outlining a possible time decay of dark energy component , but the model does not explain much about the dynamics , that is , the origin or nature of dark energy . both the conformal and holographic dark energy models are interesting in the sense that they satisfy some holographic entropy bounds ( or laws of thermodynamics , in equivalent forms ) .",
    "but they still raise some other important concerns : why quantum corrections to the vacuum energy contribute to the present - day dark energy density ( @xmath289 ) dominantly , whereas many known contributions to @xmath290 , including the classical effects of quantum fields , do not ? and why it is comparable to the energy density of matter today ?    the holographic dark energy model is perhaps a step forward among the recent attempts in probing a time - variation of dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity , even though the model has some pitfalls , such as , a semi - classical instability due to a negative value for the squared of sound speed .",
