    "the properties of a two - component bose - einstein condensate were discussed by alexandrov and kabanov @xcite . there",
    "the bogoliubov theory was extended for a two - component , non - converting three - dimensional charge or neutral bose gas .",
    "here we make the additional contributions of the linear response function and dielectric function for a two - component cbg in the condensation phase ( @xmath0 ) as well as the confirmation of the plasmon excitation spectrum using the gross - pitaevskii ( g - p ) equations .",
    "studies of the bose condensation temperature in the cuprates @xcite and also recent experiments on bec in @xmath1 atoms in two different hyperfine states @xcite gives the main motivation .",
    "such a model could apply for the cuprates since the two components may describe bipolarons travelling in either the x- or y - direction .",
    "we give an outline of the main results from studies by alexandrov et al @xcite . in an external vector potential @xmath2 and a scalar potential @xmath3 ,",
    "the hamiltonian for a two - component ( j=1,2 ) bose gas is given as    @xmath4\\psi_j(\\bm{r})+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j , j'}\\int d\\bm{r}\\int d\\bm{r } ' v_{jj'}(\\bm{r}-\\bm{r } ' ) \\psi^{\\dagger}_j(\\bm{r } ) \\psi_j(\\bm{r})\\psi^{\\dagger}_{j'}(\\bm{r } ' ) \\psi_{j'}(\\bm{r}'),\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the charge and mass of the @xmath7 bosons .",
    "provided the two body interaction @xmath8 is weak , one may assume the ground state is macroscopically occupied .",
    "hence one can apply a bogoliubov displacement transformation @xmath9 and consider the excitations as fluctuations from the ground state .",
    "furthermore one then applies a bogoliubov linear transformation for the fluctuations @xmath10 one obtains the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations :    @xmath11\\ ] ]    and    @xmath12,\\ ] ]    where @xmath13=\\delta(\\bm{r}-\\bm{r}')\\ ] ] and @xmath14 using these bdg equations one finds the elementary excitations for a two - component bose condensate with arbitrary interactions :    @xmath15 ^ 2 + \\frac{4k^4}{m_1m_2}w^2_{\\bm{k}}n_1n_2}\\right)^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where we assume no external fields and that the excitation coherence factors are plane waves @xmath16 also we have used the definitions @xmath17 and where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the fourier components of the interactions @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "this result implies there are two branches , acoustic and optical .",
    "the acoustic branch is quadratic in k and means that the condition for superfluidity is not met ( landau criterium ) .",
    "however such a problem can be avoided by considering more than one interaction potential , for example a hard - core and a long - range potential .",
    "therefore a two - component bipolaron gas may still be a superfluid .",
    "here we derive the linear response function for a two - component cbg . from this",
    "we obtain the dielectric function and examine its behaviour . in the process",
    "we find the same excitation spectrum found earlier using the bogoliubov equations of the previous section .",
    "the g - p equation in the condensed phase is written :    @xmath22    we allow for small fluctuations of the order parameter as @xmath23 and keeping terms linear in @xmath24 and fluctuations @xmath25 and assuming we have a homogeneous background charge : @xmath26 we obtain    @xmath27.\\ ] ]    by fourier transformation this becomes    @xmath28.\\ ] ]    the complex conjugate is easily found to be    @xmath29\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the fourier transform of the external vector potential .",
    "the 4 equations can be written in a matrix form as    @xmath32    solving this gives the excitation spectrum of a two - component cbg in an external field with arbitrary interactions .",
    "it is useful to make sure the excitation spectrum is the same as that found by using the bdg equations @xcite . in the presence of no external fields",
    "the determinant is zero and hence gives    @xmath33 ^ 2 + \\frac{4k^4}{m_1m_{2}}v^2n_{o1}n_{o2}}\\right)\\ ] ]    where we assume that @xmath34 .",
    "this result is equivalent to eqn 8 .",
    "again this leads to the acoustic and plasmon modes .",
    "for the purposes of the linear response function , we write the definitions    @xmath35    and @xmath36 and solve eqns 17 and 18 .",
    "@xmath37    in the presence of external fields ( @xmath38 ) we can solve for @xmath39 : @xmath40 this equation simplifies into the case for a single component charge bose gas as found in ref @xcite .",
    "this can be done by taking the second component number density @xmath41 : @xmath42    back to the two - component system , the linear - response function @xmath43 is defined for each component j of the charge bose gas as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the current in the m direction and @xmath46 is the vector potential in the n direction .",
    "the currents of the two components are found to be independent ( from commutation rules of two internal components ) .",
    "interference of the two components is taken into account as will be demonstrated now .",
    "for each current we have @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{e^{*2}}{m_j}|\\psi_{0j}(\\bm{r } , t)|^2\\bm{a}(\\bm{r},t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as before : @xmath23 keeping terms linear in @xmath24 and fluctuations @xmath48 and performing the fourier transform we obtain @xmath49\\bm{q } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{e^{*2}n_{0j}}{m_j}\\bm{a}(\\bm{q},\\omega)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term contains @xmath50 and so the current for one component includes interference effects from the other .",
    "subbing in we obtain for the current    @xmath51}{(\\omega^2-\\varepsilon^2_{j})(\\omega^2-\\varepsilon^2_{j'})- \\frac{v^2n_{0j'}n_{0j}q^4}{m_{j'}m_{j}}}+\\bm{a}\\right].\\ ] ]    we can therefore write the linear - response function as    @xmath52\\ ] ]    where the linear - response function has been divided into a longitudinal and transverse part . since we ultimately want to examine the dielectric function @xmath53 we examine the longitudinal part which can be reduced down to @xmath54 } { ( \\omega^2-\\varepsilon^2_{j})(\\omega^2-\\varepsilon^2_{j'})-\\omega^2_{p0j}\\omega^2_{p0j'}}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 .    to obtain the dielectric function we use the continuity equation @xmath56 one of the maxwell equations @xmath57 the current - external electric field relation @xmath58 and the usual definition for the dielectric function @xmath59 here @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are induced , external and total charge density .",
    "we find for the inverse dielectric function @xmath63 doing the summation @xmath64 + \\omega^2_{p02}[\\omega^2+\\omega^2_{p01}-\\varepsilon^2_{1 } ] } { ( \\omega^2-\\varepsilon^2_{2})(\\omega^2-\\varepsilon^2_{2})-\\omega^2_{p01}\\omega^2_{p02}}\\ ] ] and rearranging for the static case we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 the result is exactly the same as for a single component system @xcite except here the screening wavenumber is effectively a sum of number densities . in fig 1",
    "we plot the inverse static dielectric function .",
    "we notice that as the second components number density is increased the screening becomes stronger at intermediate q values as expected .",
    "a two - component cbg with arbitrary interactions has been examined .",
    "the study of its linear response and dielectric function yield similar results to a single component cbg .",
    "the excitation spectrum in an external field was derived , whilst it was used to re - confirm previous results which were derived with no external field .",
    "this study of a two - component cbg should be useful for further studies in bipolaronic systems applied to lattices .",
    "also it will be useful to work in atomic physics .",
