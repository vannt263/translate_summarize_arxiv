    "rigidity theory @xcite has improved considerably our understanding of the structural , elastic and dynamical properties of systems such as chalcogenide glasses @xcite , interfaces @xcite and proteins @xcite , as a function of their connectivity . in its classical version ,",
    "it introduces the concept of a rigidity transition , separating a soft ( or _ floppy _ ) and a _ rigid _ phases characterized by a mean coordination number . in many systems , optima or thresholds of various physical quantities",
    "are often observed at the rigidity transition .",
    "some time ago , for example , phillips @xcite noted that among chalcogenides , the best glassformers have a mean coordination such that the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of covalent ( bond - stretching and bond - bending ) constraints . at this point , corresponding to the rigidity transition , networks are largely rigid but stress - free .",
    "this prevents crystallization for both kinetic and thermodynamic reasons : being stress - free , the glassy state is not too energetically unfavorable compared to the crystal ; being rigid , the networks lack the flexibility to efficiently explore the phase space and reach the crystalline state fast . similarly , in the last 5 years",
    ", it has become clear that most proteins in their native state sit almost exactly at the rigidity transition , which could be necessary to have enough flexibility to fullfill their function while retaining their overall structure @xcite .",
    "recently , a series of experiments on chalcogenide and oxide glasses @xcite have demonstrated the existence of a number of interesting and surprising behaviors .",
    "for instance , glasses with nearly optimal properties , such as the absence of aging @xcite and vanishing non - reversing enthalpy of the glass transition @xcite are observed not just at a particular mean coordination , but in some range of coordinations , suggesting the presence of an _ intermediate phase _ between the floppy and the rigid phases . while the details and exact origin of this intermediate phase are still a matter of debate ( see , for example , the recent experimental paper by golovchak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , it appears that it is due to the self - organization of the network minimizing the internal stress .",
    "if , according to phillips argument , we expect `` optimal '' glasses to be rigid but stress - free , we should now expect to find this property everywhere in the intermediate phase rather than only at a single critical point , as in the standard phase diagram of rigidity percolation ; there is now some direct evidence for this @xcite .",
    "a few models were proposed to explain this self - organization .",
    "_ @xcite have shown in an out - of - equilibrium model that it is possible to generate a stress - free intermediate phase .",
    "@xcite have shown in addition that such a phase was thermodynamically stable on a ring - free bethe lattice , where each site has 3 degrees of freedom , but the whole network is embedded in an infinite - dimensional space . taking a different approach , micoulaut @xcite demonstrated that one could recover an intermediate phase by concentrating all the strain in local structures .    the goal of this paper is to assess whether or not a self - organized network with a finite - dimensional topology is also thermodynamically possible .",
    "this verification is important on two counts : ( 1 ) the bethe lattice is a loopless structure producing a first - order rigidity transition @xcite while 2- and 3-dimensional regular networks undergo a second - order phase transition @xcite ; ( 2 ) the original model of thorpe _ et al . _",
    "is an out - of - equilibrium model which could lead to highly atypical networks .    for simplicity ,",
    "we study two - dimensional central - force ( 2d cf ) networks .",
    "this allows us to consider networks of much bigger linear dimensions than is possible in 3d , limiting the finite - size effects .",
    "moreover , in all cases studied until now , rigidity results for 2d cf networks have been qualitatively very similar to those obtained for 3d glass networks .",
    "our results should therefore also apply to glass networks .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the basic facts about rigidity and the intermediate phase .",
    "we then explain the model used here and present our results for a bond - diluted two - dimensional triangular network .",
    "we first discuss an unusual property of our model : a network in the intermediate phase can be either rigid or floppy with a finite probability .",
    "we then focus on the calculation of the entropy of self - organized networks .",
    "in rigidity theory , an elastic network is characterized by the number of motions , called _ floppy modes _ , that do not distort any constraints . in a system with no constraints ,",
    "all degrees of freedom are floppy modes and thus their number is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of atoms and @xmath2 is the dimensionality of space . in an approximation due to maxwell and known as maxwell counting @xcite , it is assumed that each additional constraint removes a floppy mode , so that the number of floppy modes for a given number of constraints @xmath3 can be written as @xmath4 when the number of constraints becomes equal to the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath5 and the network undergoes a rigidity percolation transition , going from floppy to rigid . in a 2d cf network ,",
    "the number of constraints per atom is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean coordination ( the average number of connections of a site ) ; the critical coordination is therefore @xmath8 . in chalcogenide glasses , characterized by the chemical formula a@xmath9b@xmath10c@xmath11 , where a is an atom of valence 4 ( usually ge or si ) , b is an atom of valence 3 ( as or p ) and c is a chalcogen ( se , s or te ) , counting both covalent bonds and their related angular constraints , the critical coordination is @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "since maxwell counting is a mean - field theory , it ignores fluctuations and correlations that can be built in the network .",
    "an overall rigid network can have some internal localized floppy modes .",
    "also , a constraint inserted into a piece of the network that is already rigid does not remove floppy modes .",
    "such constraints , known as _ redundant _ , are obviously present in the rigid phase , where eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) gives a negative number of floppy modes , since this number can not be lower than @xmath13 ( 6 in 3d , 3 in 2d ) , to account for rigid body translations and rotations ; but redundant constraints can also be present , of course , in an overall floppy network .",
    "in generic networks , such as glasses , where the bond lengths vary , these constraints create an internal stress and increase the elastic energy , since at least some part of the network has to be deformed to accommodate them .",
    "if the number of redundant constraints , @xmath14 , is known , then the maxwell counting formula can be corrected : @xmath15 this result is exact  the problem lies in calculating @xmath14 .",
    "a theorem by laman @xcite makes this possible .",
    "consider all possible subnetworks of a system .",
    "if the number of degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints is less than @xmath13 for at least one subnetwork , there must be redundant constraints .",
    "laman showed that this is the only way redundant constraints can occur : for them to be present , the above _ must _ be satisfied for at least one subnetwork .",
    "this is strictly true in 2d ; although there are known counterexamples for general networks in 3d , it is _ assumed _ true ( there is no rigorous mathematical proof , but no known counterexamples either ) for glassy networks with covalent bonding including angular constraints @xcite .",
    "laman s theorem is used in a computer algorithm for rigidity analysis , known as the _ pebble game _ @xcite .",
    "the pebble game starts with an empty network and then one constraint is added at a time and each added constraint is checked for redundancy .",
    "thus at every stage in the network - building process the number of redundant constraints , @xmath14 , and , according to eq .",
    "[ maxexact ] , @xmath16 , are known exactly .",
    "independent constraints are matched to _",
    "pebbles _ that are assigned to sites and whose total number is equal to the number of degrees of freedom ; thus the number of free pebbles ( not matched to any constraint ) gives the number of floppy modes .",
    "the pebble game , in addition , identifies stressed regions in the network and also offers _ rigid cluster decomposition _ that identifies all rigid clusters in the network .",
    "the analysis provided by the pebble game is purely topological , the details of the geometry are not taken into account , nor is the exact expression for the forces .",
    "the downside is that the pebble game ( as well as laman s theorem itself ) is only applicable to _ generic _ networks : networks special in some way ( having parallel bonds , for instance ) may have rigidity properties that are different from those of the vast majority of networks of a given topology .",
    "the fraction of such special ( or _ non - generic _ ) networks among all networks of a given topology is , however , zero , and so a covalent glass network , being disordered , can be safely assumed to be generic .",
    "recently , a series of experiments @xcite have suggested that there could be not one but _ two _ phase transitions near @xmath12 , with the opening of an _ intermediate phase _ between the phases already known .",
    "the properties of this phase suggest that the intermediate phase is rigid but stress - free . to explain the presence of two transitions and the intermediate phase between them within the framework of rigidity theory , it has been proposed @xcite that the glass networks _ self - organize _ in some way . broadly speaking",
    ", any reduction in the amount of disorder in the network as it tries to minimize its free energy can be referred to as self - organization ; chemical order , especially strong in oxide glasses like silica , would be one example .",
    "@xcite considered a particular kind of self - organization : glass networks minimizing their elastic stress energy . as a proof of principle",
    ", they constructed the following model . starting with a low - coordination stress - free network , bonds are added one at a time with the restriction that they can not be redundant and thus add stress to the network , using the pebble game for constructing and analyzing the network at each step .",
    "this process is repeated until it is no longer possible to add a bond without introducing stress to the network .",
    "after that , bond insertion continues at random .",
    "the maximum coordination at which no stress is present , according to eq .",
    "( [ maxexact ] ) , can not exceed the rigidity threshold according to maxwell counting ( @xmath8 for 2d cf networks and @xmath12 for covalent glass networks ) .",
    "in fact , in the model of thorpe _ et al .",
    "_ , the maxwell counting threshold value is reached without stress for 2d cf networks , but not for the 3d glass network @xcite . in this model ,",
    "once the stress appears , it immediately percolates , corresponding to the upper boundary of the intermediate phase . in general , this need not be the case , since a network can have finite stressed regions without stress percolating ( this is the case in the model of micoulaut and phillips @xcite ) .    to observe the rigidity transition in a two - dimensional diluted regular lattice",
    ", one needs a lattice with coordination bigger than 4 , and so the triangular lattice is a natural choice .",
    "since the pebble game algorithm can only be applied to generic networks , one has to assume that the triangular lattice is distorted ( for example , by having some disorder in bond lengths ) .",
    "previous numerical studies for the randomly diluted triangular lattice without self - organization indicate a single rigidity and stress transition at @xmath17  very close to the maxwell counting prediction ( fig .",
    "[ old ] ) @xcite .",
    "note that the rigidity and stress transitions coincide in this case .    in the self - organization model of thorpe _",
    ", a numerical simulation reveals instead two phase transitions ( fig .",
    "[ old ] ) .",
    "as the coordination is increased from the floppy phase , a percolating rigid cluster appears at @xmath18 . at this point , by construction , the network is still stress - free .",
    "this is the lower boundary of the rigid but stress - free intermediate phase  the rigidity percolation transition . as the mean coordination continues to grow ,",
    "keeping the network stress - free becomes impossible . at this point , which , as mentioned above , is at @xmath8 , the stress appears and immediately percolates .",
    "this is the stress percolation transition , which is the upper boundary of the intermediate phase .    the probability of a percolating cluster in the model of thorpe _ et al .",
    "_ is zero below the rigidity percolation threshold and one above in the thermodynamic limit , as normally is the case for percolation transitions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ propercold ] , where the probability of having a percolating cluster is shown for different network sizes . as expected , the dependence gets closer to a step function as the size increases .",
    "the self - organization model of thorpe _ et al . _ is peculiar in that bonds are only added to the network and never removed .",
    "while one can imagine a very rapid quench process in which indeed bond formation dominates , this process does not lead to formation of good glasses . therefore a way of building equilibrated stress - free networks",
    "is needed .",
    "as the elastic energy of a stress - free network is zero , any such networks should occur with equal probability .",
    "a similar issue arose before in the case of conventional ( or connectivity ) percolation . in the rigidity case , self - organization proceeds by avoiding stress or redundancy , i.e. , bonds that connect already mutually rigid sites .",
    "the connectivity analog consists in avoiding connections between sites that are already connected , i.e. , creating loops .",
    "straley @xcite proposed a model directly analogous to the one by thorpe _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "i.e. , with bonds inserted one at a time and those forming loops rejected ; connectivity percolation occurs at some point , and then there is an `` intermediate phase '' ( although it was not referred to as such in the connectivity percolation context ) that is connected but without any loops , until a point is reached at which avoiding loops is no longer possible ( at this point the network is a _ spanning tree _ ) .",
    "it was realized later on that this model does not produce a uniform ensemble , in which every loopless network would occur with equal probability .",
    "several authors , using a variety of methods @xcite , claimed then that in the equilibrated uniform ensemble , connectivity percolation does not occur until the spanning tree limit is reached , i.e. , there is no intermediate phase .",
    "this shows that the results may change significantly depending on the ensemble of self - organized networks that is considered .",
    "braswell _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in particular , used the following algorithm to generate equiprobable loopless networks : take an arbitrary loopless network , choose a bond at random , delete it and then reinsert at an arbitrary place where it would not form a loop , with this place chosen equiprobably among all such places .",
    "they showed that after equilibration has taken place , this method would indeed generate the uniform ensemble of networks , by proving the detailed balance condition , i.e. , that given some loopless network 1 , the probability that in a single step of the algorithm some other network 2 would be produced is the same as the probability of going in the opposite direction , i.e. , from network 2 to network 1 .",
    "their arguments fully apply to the rigidity case as well .    in view of the above",
    ", we consider a variety of the self - organization model by thorpe _",
    ", adding equilibration that produces equiprobable stress - free networks . like in the previous model ,",
    "we start with the `` empty '' network without bonds and start inserting bonds one by one without creating stress . after every bond insertion , we equilibrate by doing bond swaps following the procedure described above , i.e. , choose a bond at random , delete it and then insert a bond elsewhere choosing at random among the places where that new bond would not create stress .",
    "it is worth noting that in general it is rather difficult to handle removal of constraints within the pebble game ; but it is easy to remove an unstressed constraint , as this simply involves releasing the associated pebble with no additional pebble rearrangement . since in our case",
    "all constraints are unstressed by construction , no problem arises . in this paper",
    "we focus on the intermediate phase and do not investigate the stressed phase , so we stop at the point at which further stressless insertion becomes impossible .    a very similar model has been proposed recently by barr _",
    "_ @xcite using a bethe lattice and , as an added sophistication , an energy - cost function linear in the number of redundant constraints .",
    "while this energy is somewhat unrealistic , it provides a thermodynamic justification for the existence of the intermediate phase . however , bethe lattices are particular constructions , leading to a first - order rigidity phase transition while 2d central - force and 3d bond - bending networks show a second - order rigidity transition . by comparison",
    ", our model in essence assigns an infinite cost to redundant bonds and corresponds therefore to the @xmath19 limit of barr s model but on a regular lattice with a second - order rigidity transition .",
    "our simulations for the new model with equilibration are done for 2d cf bond - diluted triangular lattices .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used with the supercell consisting of the same number of unit cells in both directions .",
    "we have chosen the duration of equilibration equal to 100 steps above @xmath20 and 10 steps below ( where even in random networks there are very few redundant constraints , so the self - organized networks are almost completely random anyway and long equilibration is not needed ) .",
    "this is sufficient for convergence as shown in fig .",
    "[ properctime ] for a @xmath21 lattice ; we also checked that 100 steps was sufficient by comparing with a very long equilibration run at a single point @xmath22 for the largest lattice used here ( not shown ) .",
    "the result we get is quite different from that obtained without equilibration .",
    "[ propercsize ] , just as fig .",
    "[ propercold ] , shows the probability of rigidity percolation as a function of @xmath7 for several different sizes , but now for the model with equilibration .",
    "the self - organization still opens an intermediate phase around the critical point found at @xmath23 in the standard rigidity phase diagram .",
    "but rather than approaching a step function as the size increases , the result for the probability of percolation is now a gradual increase from 0 at @xmath24 to 1 at @xmath8 .",
    "this is similar to the result on a bethe lattice in the model of barr _ et al .",
    "_ , even though the rigidity percolation transition is of a different order .",
    "the dependence of the percolation probability on @xmath7 is close to linear and this linearity may , in fact , be exact , although a very small non - linear region near the lower boundary of the intermediate phase can not be ruled out .",
    "one difference between our result and that presented by barr _",
    "is that since their consideration is at a non - zero temperature , there is always a possibility of having a small number of redundant constraints ; since adding very few ( perhaps @xmath25 ) redundant constraints to an unstressed network is often enough for stress percolation , it is not surprising that they have found a finite probability of both rigidity and stress percolation in the intermediate phase , whereas in our case , the stress percolation probability is , of course , zero by construction .",
    "although we do not include a potential energy explicitly , the self - organization models discussed here are constructed to prevent the build - up of stress , implicitly minimizing the potential energy of the system . at a finite temperature , however , we are interested in minimizing the free energy .",
    "as glasses are formed at a non - zero temperature , the thermodynamical state will be influenced by the balance between the entropic cost associated with generating a self - organized network and the energetic cost of creating internal stress : if the entropy of the random network is large compared with that of the self - organized one , then it is likely that very little self - organization will take place and the problem discussed here becomes irrelevant",
    ".    the entropy of a covalent network can be viewed as consisting of two parts .",
    "the first part , the _ topological entropy _ , is proportional to the logarithm of the number of different possible bond topologies or bond configurations .",
    "the second part , which can be called , somewhat simplistically , the _ flexibility entropy _ , depends on the phase space available to each such bond configuration .",
    "this division of the total entropy is similar , but not identical , to the traditional division into the configurational and vibrational entropy in the inherent structure formalism @xcite . in particular",
    ", flexible networks exhibit a wide range of motions and would generally correspond to more than one inherent structure , when a potential energy function is defined .",
    "for this reason , the flexibility entropy includes both harmonic and anharmonic contributions associated with a given topology of the covalent network ; its exact evaluation is difficult and goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , since the flexibility entropy is expected to be roughly proportional to the number of floppy modes @xcite , and , according to eq .",
    "( [ maxexact ] ) , the number of floppy modes in a self - organized network ( with @xmath26 ) is smaller than in a random network ( @xmath27 ) with the same number of constraints @xmath3 , the flexibility entropy of the self - organized network is likely to be smaller than that of the random network .",
    "this difference is probably not very large , especially in real systems where long - range forces reduce significantly the available configuration space even in the floppy phase .",
    "the topological entropy is , in general , difficult to calculate as well , although methods , such as that by vink and barkema @xcite , exist .",
    "it is much simpler for a lattice - based model like ours , as it requires only counting the number of possible bond configurations on a lattice . in this case , the topological entropy ( which we can also call the bond - configurational entropy ) is simply @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of stress - free configurations with mean coordination @xmath7 and the boltzmann constant @xmath30 is put equal to 1 .",
    "to calculate @xmath31 , we use the following approach .",
    "suppose the number of stress - free networks having @xmath32 bonds , @xmath33 , is known . from a stress - free network having @xmath32 bonds , it is possible to produce a stress - free network having @xmath34 bonds by adding a bond in one of those places where this added bond would not create stress .",
    "suppose on average there are @xmath35 such places or ways to create a stress - free network with @xmath34 bonds .",
    "on the other hand , for any stress - free network with @xmath34 bonds , there are always exactly @xmath36 ways of creating a stress - free network with @xmath32 bonds by removing any one of the @xmath34 bonds .",
    "moreover , if a network with @xmath34 bonds can be created from a network with @xmath32 bonds by adding a bond , then the latter network can always be obtained from the former by removing that same bond and vice versa , so the process is reversible",
    ". then the number of stress - free networks with @xmath34 bonds is @xmath37 if @xmath35 is known for all @xmath32 , then , using @xmath38 as the initial condition , eq .",

    "is then averaged over the networks with a given number of bonds obtained during the equilibration procedure .",
    "note that the same procedure can be repeated for the random case ( without any self - organization ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath35 should count all ways to create a new network of @xmath34 bonds ( no matter stress - free or not ) out of a network of @xmath32 bonds , and there are as many ways to do that as there are places where a bond is missing ( compared to the full lattice ) ; thus for a random network , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of bonds in the full lattice . on the other hand ,",
    "the analog of quantity @xmath41 , which we denote @xmath42 , is still @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , for the random network , @xmath43 this can , of course , be used to obtain the analytical result for any @xmath32 , which is simply a binomial coefficient .",
    "if we are interested in the _ difference _ @xmath44 between the entropies of the random and self - organized networks , this is simply @xmath45 the change of this difference when a bond is added is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average _ fraction _ of bonds whose insertion would not create stress among all missing bonds in the network .",
    "note that @xmath48 is what is calculated directly by the monte carlo procedure described above .",
    "the entropy @xmath49 is , of course , an extensive quantity , i.e. , it is proportional to the network size ( for big sizes ) .",

    "a similar consideration for the old self - organization model without equilibration would be much more difficult .",
    "we note , finally , that according to eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) , there is a non - analyticity in the behavior of the entropy when @xmath75 , i.e. , at the stress transition .",
    "we should also expect some very weak non - analyticity ( perhaps a break or a cusp in a higher derivative ) at the lower boundary of the intermediate phase ( the rigidity transition ) at @xmath24 , but it is too weak to be seen in our simulation results .",
    "we have considered a model of self - organization in elastic networks , adding an equilibration feature to the model previously considered by thorpe _",
    "et al . _ @xcite . in our model",
    ", we find an intermediate phase in the rigidity phase diagram , in which the fraction of networks in which rigidity percolates is between 0 and 1 in the range of mean coordination between 3.94 and 4.0 for the bond - diluted triangular lattice , a result qualitatively similar to that obtained by barr _",
    "@xcite in a closely related model on a bethe lattice .    calculating the bond - configurational entropy of these self - organized networks",
    ", we find that it is only about 2% smaller than that of randomly - connected networks .",
    "provided that the flexibility entropy , which should reduce the stability of the intermediate phase , is not so sensitive to the self - organization , the intermediate phase is likely to be present in most systems with the right range of mean coordination .",
    "our results support the current explanation of the intermediate phase in chalcogenide glasses .",
    "self - organization might also be important in the dynamics of proteins as they have a coordination near the critical value . in a real material ,",
    "it is likely that the intermediate phase is not perfectly stress - free",
    ". a most likely structure will therefore be mostly unstressed with overconstrained local regions , in a mixture of the model presented here and that introduced recently by micoulaut _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the fact that there is now a possibility of having non - rigid networks in the intermediate phase does not invalidate the concept of this phase as lacking both excessive flexibility and stress . indeed , even though the network may technically be floppy , say , because , of a single floppy mode or a very small number of such modes spanning the whole network , for any practical purposes , there would be no difference between such a network and a fully rigid and unstressed one , especially when the existence of the neglected weaker interactions is taken into account .",
    "knowing that self - organization can exist from a thermodynamical point of view , there is still considerable work to do in order to fully understand the intermediate phase . among the obvious future directions of this work we can mention : repeating the simulations described here for 3d bond - bending glass networks ; getting a better idea of the geometry of self - organized networks , in particular , possible long - range correlations in them ; evaluating the flexibility entropy effects using a particular potential energy function .    finally , there is a suspicious discrepancy between our results reported here and those obtained for a similar model in connectivity percolation @xcite . even though it is in principle possible",
    "that there is an intermediate phase in the rigidity case but not in the connectivity case , this seems very unlikely .",

    "<S> we modify a previously proposed model of self - organization by generating a uniform sampling of stress - free networks . in our model , studied on a diluted triangular lattice , an unusual intermediate phase appears , in which both rigid and floppy networks have a chance to occur , a result also observed in a related model on a bethe lattice by barr _ </S>",
