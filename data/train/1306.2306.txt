    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are a powerful tool to investigate the expansion history of the universe , because their peak luminosity is as bright as a galaxy and is known as an excellent standard candle . since the discovery of the acceleration of the universe based on the observations of sne ia , higher than ever accuracy of their peak luminosity is needed to investigate various problems in cosmology @xcite .",
    "we started a project to improve the accuracy of the calibration of the peak luminosity of sne ia by measuring accurate distances to nearby resolved galaxies that host sne ia .",
    "we derive accurate distances to the sn ia host galaxies using the method to measure the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) @xcite .",
    "we presented the result of the first target , m101 , a well - known spiral galaxy hosting sn 2011fe that is the nearest sn ia since 1972 ( lee & jang 2012 ( paper i ) ) .",
    "this paper is the second of the series , presenting the results for m66 and m96 in the leo i group .",
    "m66 ( ngc 3627 , sab(s)b ) and m96 ( ngc 3368 , sab(rs)ab ) are nearby bright spiral galaxies hosting sne ia : sn 1989b in m66 @xcite and sn 1998bu in m96 @xcite .",
    "m66 has been host to other three sne as well : sn ii 1973r @xcite , sn imposter sn 1997bs @xcite , and sn ii - l 2009hd @xcite .",
    "they are considered to be the members of the compact leo i group that includes three subgroups : the leo triplet ( m66 , m65 , and ngc 3628 ) , the m96 group ( including m96 ( ngc 3368 ) , m95 ( ngc 3351 ) , and m105 ( ngc 3379 ) ) , and the ngc 3607 group @xcite . the leo i group has played an important role as a stepping stone for calibration of the secondary distance indicators , because it includes both early and late type galaxies at the distance closer than the virgo cluster and because it hosts sne ia . in particular m66 and m96 have been used as important calibrators for the absolute magnitudes of sne ia and the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a value for the distance to the leo i group , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 mpc ) , from the mean of the known distances to five brightest galaxies in the group ( m66 , m95 , m96 , m105 , ngc 3351 and ngc 3377 ) .",
    "often the member galaxy candidates without known distances are assumed to be at the same distance , but it is still important to derive a precise distance to each member galaxy candidate for investigating various aspects of the member galaxies .",
    "unfortunately recent estimates of the distances to m66 and m96 based on resolved stars show a large range @xcite .",
    "@xcite found 68 cepheids in m66 from @xmath1 and @xmath2 images obtained with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_/wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and derived a distance modulus of @xmath17 from the photometry of 25 good cepheids .",
    "later cepheid estimates range from @xmath18 @xcite to @xmath19 @xcite , showing as much as 0.8 mag differences . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite presented a distance modulus @xmath20 using the trgb method from @xmath1 and @xmath2 images obtained with the @xmath21/advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "furthermore @xcite presented an even smaller trgb distance estimate , @xmath22 .",
    "thus there is a significant difference between the cepheid distances and trgb distances as well as among the estimates of each method . in the case of m96",
    ", @xcite found 7 cepheids from @xmath21/wfpc2 @xmath1 and @xmath2 images and derived a distance modulus of @xmath23 .",
    "later cepheid estimates showed a significant spread , ranging from @xmath24 @xcite to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly @xcite presented a much smaller trgb distance estimate @xmath26 derived from the @xmath21 images .",
    "thus the difference between the cepheid distances and trgb distance is as much as 0.3 to 0.7 mag and the range of the cepheid distances is about 0.4 . in this study",
    "we use the well - known trgb method to estimate the distances to m66 and m96 from the images available in the @xmath21 archive .",
    "the trgb method is an efficient and precise primary distance indicator for resolved galaxies so that it is an excellent tool for calibration of more powerful distance indicators such as sn ia and tully - fisher relations @xcite .",
    "section 2 describes how we derive photometry of the point sources in the images and  3 presents color - magnitude diagrams of the resolved stars in each galaxy , and derive distances to each galaxy using the trgb method .",
    "we discuss implications of our results in  4 , and summarizes primary results in the final section .",

    "we present @xmath0 photometry of the resolved stars in two spiral galaxies m66 and m96 that host sne ia in the leo i group , derived from @xmath21/acs @xmath1 and @xmath2 images",
    ". then we estimate the distances to these two galaxies applying the trgb method to this photometry .",
    "we summarize main results in the following .",
    "* most of the resolved stars in the selected regions of m66 and m96 are red giants , allowing us to determine the distances to these galaxies . * the @xmath3-band magnitudes of the trgb",
    "are found to be @xmath4 for m66 and @xmath5 for m96 .",
    "these trgb magnitudes yield distance modulus @xmath27 for m66 and @xmath28 for m96 .",
    "this result shows that m66 and m96 are the members of the same group . *",
    "the absolute maximum magnitudes of the sne ia are derived from the previous photometry and the distance measurement in this study , as listed in tables 5 and 6 .",
    "similarly we derive nir magnitudes for sn 1998bu : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . * combining the results for sn 1989b and sn 1998bu with those for sn 2011fe in m101 based on the same method given in @xcite",
    ", we obtain an estimate of the hubble constant , @xmath32 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
