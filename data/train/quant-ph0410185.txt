    "if not stated explicitly otherwise an optical terminology is used throughout the article in which the cv systems involved are single modes of an optical field and the role of the canonically conjugate variables is played by the quadrature amplitudes of the optical field .",
    "we use the heisenberg picture description of teleportation as introduced in @xcite .    at the beginning of our protocol ,",
    "alice and bob share the state of two modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 produced by the qnd interaction ( [ hqnd ] ) of two vacuum states @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in heisenberg picture , the quadratures @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the two vacuum modes transform as @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath30 is the interaction time ) is the interaction constant . for any @xmath40 the produced state",
    "is an entangled state whose entanglement increases with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "this can be seen by noting that the purity of the reduced state of the mode @xmath2 given by the formula @xmath42 is less than unity for any @xmath40 and goes to zero with increasing @xmath41 . here and",
    "in the rest of this section the angle brackets denote the averaging over the initial state @xmath43 .",
    "the produced entanglement is not the epr entanglement as @xmath44/2\\geq 1/2 $ ] and therefore it does not `` match '' the bk scheme . for this reason",
    ", alice performs the bell measurement that differs from the bell measurement used in the bk scheme .",
    "she lets her mode @xmath2 to interact with the input mode `` in '' whose unknown coherent state @xmath45 is to be teleported in another qnd interaction @xmath46 and subsequently measures the quadratures @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the quadratures @xmath4 and @xmath1 are the so - called qnd variables that are not affected by the interaction @xmath50 .",
    "this interaction , however , establishes correlations between @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "if the mode @xmath2 were infinitely squeezed in the quadrature @xmath5 the measurement of @xmath51 would provide result proportional to the result of the measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "this is the principle of the qnd measurement .",
    "thus , the bell measurement performed by alice in fact consists of the qnd measurement of the quadrature @xmath1 with the ancillary mode @xmath2 being a part of an entangled system and the direct measurement of the quadrature @xmath0 at the output of the qnd interaction . after the measurement alice has certain classical values @xmath11 and @xmath12 and sends them via classical channel to bob who performs the displacements ( denoted @xmath52 in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 describe normalized gains . as a result ,",
    "bob s output quadratures read as @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the quadrature added noises .",
    "note , that instead of using the qnd interaction in the bell measurement alice can use equally well an unbalanced @xmath59 with reflectivity @xmath60 and transmissivity @xmath61 . in this case",
    ", she detects the quadratures @xmath62 , @xmath63 and bob performs the displacements @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , bob s output quadratures are given by the eqs .",
    "( [ output ] ) and ( [ xp ] ) , where @xmath66 is replaced by @xmath67 .    in order",
    "to quantitatively asses the quality of our teleportation it is convenient to distinguish two different regimes of teleportation .",
    "the quality of teleportation is often expressed quantitatively by the fidelity @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the output state . in the non - unity gain regimes ( @xmath70 ) , however , the fidelity strongly depends on gains @xmath55 and @xmath56 and usually it decreases very quickly as increases the deviation of the gains from unity @xcite .",
    "therefore , there can exist non - unity gain regimes having quantum nature that are not captured by the fidelity .",
    "for this reason it was introduced a more detailed characterization of teleportation with the help of the quantities conditional variance product @xmath25 and the signal transfer coefficient @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is defined by the formula @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the quadrature conditional variances between the input and output states .",
    "the conditional variance product @xmath25 describes the noise added into the input state during the teleportation process . without entanglement the noise is limited from below by the fluctuations in bob s mode and therefore @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 indicates teleportation with no added noise .",
    "the signal transfer coefficient is defined as a sum @xmath76 of the quadrature signal transfer coefficients @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , where @xmath79 denotes conventional signal - to - noise ratio for quadrature @xmath80 .",
    "for teleportation of coherent states the parameter @xmath26 can be expressed in the form @xcite @xmath81 in the absence of entanglement the intrinsic fluctuations of alice s mode limit the transfer coefficient to @xmath82 @xcite . on the other hand @xmath83 corresponds to a perfect signal transfer . with respect to the properties of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath25",
    "it is thus natural to define quantum regime of teleportation as a regime in which @xmath84 and simultaneously @xmath85 .    in our protocol the added noises ( [ xp ] ) are uncorrelated with the input state .",

    "( [ xp ] ) .    in what follows",
    "we restrict our attention to two particular non - unity gain regimes .",
    "for these two cases we then show among other things that if our scheme operates in quantum regime when @xmath84 and @xmath85 then the signal transfer coefficient @xmath26 can be increased while preserving the conditional variance product @xmath25 by application of a suitable local squeezing operation on alice s mode .",

    "however , the eq .",
    "( [ tmin ] ) reveals that our scheme in general does not operate in the quantum regime from the point of view of the parameter @xmath26 as @xmath95 only if @xmath96 .",
    "hence , in order to fulfill both the conditions @xmath94 and @xmath95 simultaneously and thus to reach in this particular case the quantum regime of teleportation the shared entanglement must be sufficiently large .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 depends on the asymmetry parameter @xmath66 of the bell measurement and can be maximized with respect to it . solving the extremal equation @xmath98 one finds that @xmath97 has a maximum if @xmath99 and it is localized in the point @xmath100 . substituting @xmath101 to the eq .",
    "( [ tmin ] ) we arrive at the optimal signal transfer coefficient @xmath102 the latter analysis indicates that if @xmath103 the parameter @xmath97 can be increased to the optimal value ( [ tminopt ] ) by adjusting @xmath66 in the bell measurement to the optimal value @xmath101 . if the bell measurement is fixed , i. e. @xmath66 is fixed , the optimal value @xmath101 can be adjusted by a suitable squeezing operation on alice s mode .",
    "namely , the squeezing operation @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 is the squeezing parameter ) transforms effectively @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ xp ] ) to @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , if the squeezing operation is such that @xmath108 we attain optimal value of the signal transfer coefficient ( [ tminopt ] ) . as the parameter @xmath109 remains preserved when changing @xmath66 ( it does not depend on @xmath66 ) we get deeper into the quantum region of teleportation and thus improve the quality of teleportation in our protocol .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath110 and the bell measurement is realized by the balanced @xmath59 for which @xmath111 the formula ( [ tmin ] ) gives @xmath112 whereas for the unbalanced bs with @xmath113 it gives a higher signal transfer coefficient @xmath114 .",
    "in addition , for the scheme with @xmath115 @xmath116 but @xmath117 with increasing @xmath41 in contrast with the improved scheme where @xmath118 and @xmath119 with increasing @xmath41 and therefore we approach perfect teleportation from the point of view of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath25 with increasing shared entanglement .",
    "the regime when the input signals are transferred optimally , i. e. the gains @xmath55 and @xmath56 are adjusted in such a way that @xmath120 .",

    "( [ vmax ] ) reveals that @xmath127 only if @xmath128[g^{2}+(\\sqrt{5}-1)/2]>0 $ ] .",
    "hence , like in the previous case our scheme works in the quantum regime of teleportation when @xmath125 and simultaneously @xmath127 only if @xmath129 , i. e. only if the shared entanglement is strong enough .",
    "further , as in the previous case we can maximize @xmath130 with respect to @xmath66 . solving the respective extremal equation @xmath131",
    "one finds that @xmath130 attains maximum at the same point @xmath100 as @xmath132 and it is equal to @xmath133 similarly as in the case 1 this optimal value of the signal transfer coefficient can be reached by adjusting @xmath66 in the bell measurement to the @xmath101 or , for fixed @xmath66 in the bell measurement , by using the same squeezing operation on alice s mode as in the case 1 .",
    "further , for @xmath110 and for the balanced bs in the bell measurement ( @xmath115 ) the eq .",
    "( [ tmax ] ) leads to the signal transfer coefficient @xmath134 while for the unbalanced bs with @xmath135 we obtain using the eq .",

    "the gains are adjusted in such a way that @xmath140 .",
    "then , it follows from the eqs .",
    "( [ output ] ) and ( [ xp ] ) that the first moments of the input state are preserved , i. e. @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "this implies , that in the unity gain regime the quality of our teleportation depends only on the added noises ( [ xp ] ) and therefore it can be conveniently described by the fidelity @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath143 corresponds to a perfect teleportation while @xmath28 indicates quantum regime of teleportation @xcite .",
    "since in our protocol the added noises ( [ xp ] ) are uncorrelated both mutually and also with the input state the fidelity can be expressed as @xcite @xmath144 calculating the variances @xmath145 and @xmath146 using the eqs .",
    "( [ added ] ) where @xmath140 we finally arrive at the fidelity of teleportation of our scheme in the form : @xmath147\\left[3+(g - g')^{2}\\right]}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] several important properties of our teleportation protocol can be derived from the latter formula .",
    "first , it reveals that if the parameter @xmath66 in the bell measurement can be adjusted properly then the quantum regime of teleportation can be attained for an arbitrarily small amount of the shared entanglement .",
    "this follows from the fact that if we put , e. g. , @xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) then @xmath28 for any @xmath40 .",
    "second , as the denominator in the eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) is always greater or equal to @xmath149 the maximum achievable fidelity is bounded by the value @xmath150 that can be achieved , e. g. , in the limit @xmath151 .",
    "finally , the formula ( [ f1 ] ) also reveals that although one could be tempted to think that for a given @xmath41 maximal fidelity is obtained for @xmath152 this is not the case and the fidelity is maximized by @xmath66 that in general _ differs _ from @xmath41 . to illustrate this",
    "let us consider the particular value of the interaction constant @xmath153 that is well within reach of the current experiment @xcite . setting the derivative of the eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) with respect to @xmath66 equal to zero and solving the obtained extremal equation one finds that @xmath27 attains maximum for @xmath154 . on inserting @xmath155 back into the eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) for @xmath153 we finally get the maximum fidelity equal to @xmath156 .    our results can be compared with the results obtained by horoshko and kilin ( hk ) @xcite . as in our protocol",
    "also in the hk protocol the shared entanglement is produced by the qnd interaction ( [ hqnd ] ) and the bell measurement utilizes an unbalanced bs .",
    "in contrast with our protocol , in the hk protocol the asymmetry parameter @xmath67 of the bs and the interaction constant @xmath41 are tied together by the relation @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath152 the formula ( [ f1 ] ) reduces to the fidelity of teleportation of coherent states in the hk protocol @xmath158 clearly , like in our teleportation protocol the maximum teleportation fidelity is @xmath159 and it is achieved in the limit @xmath160 .",
    "however , in contrast to our protocol , quantum teleportation can be achieved only if @xmath161 , i. e. @xmath162 only if sufficiently large shared entanglement is available .",
    "in addition , our results reveal that for @xmath153 our scheme provides a higher teleportation fidelity @xmath163 than the hk scheme that gives only @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , in the teleportation scheme using the shared entanglement produced by the qnd interaction ( [ hqnd ] ) with @xmath153 of two vacua , a higher teleportation fidelity is obtained in the scheme with an unbalanced bs in the bell measurement with @xmath165 and @xmath166 than in the hk scheme that exploits the balanced bs .",
    "the previous results reveal that no matter what is the value of the parameter @xmath66 in the bell measurement and how strong is the shared entanglement the highest possible fidelity @xmath167 is always less than unity . in other words ,",
    "the quality of transfer in our teleportation protocol is limited even in the limit of the infinitely large shared entanglement .",
    "this behaviour is due to the added noise @xmath168 given in eq .",
    "( [ xp ] ) that always contains at least one unit of the vacuum noise originating from the term @xmath36 .",
    "however , this undesirable noise can be reduced and therefore the fidelity of our scheme can be increased if alice and bob transform the shared state by the local squeezing operations ( denoted as @xmath169 and @xmath170 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , where @xmath175 .",
    "these operations transform the original added noises @xmath176 and @xmath177 into the new added noises @xmath178 and @xmath179 . calculating the variances @xmath180 and @xmath181 using the eq .",
    "( [ qndheis ] ) one finds that @xmath182 with increasing @xmath41 and therefore the new added noises vanish with increasing entanglement .",
    "hence , by using the eq .",
    "( [ fqnd1 ] ) we finally arrive at the fidelity of teleportation in the improved scheme of the form : @xmath183 obviously , the eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) demonstrates that the quantum regime of teleportation when @xmath184 is again reached for any @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath185 with increasing @xmath41 @xmath186 with increasing @xmath41 and the output state converges to the input state with increasing entanglement similarly as in the bk scheme .",
    "in fact , the formula ( [ f2 ] ) can be rewritten in the form of the fidelity of the bk scheme @xmath187 @xcite , where @xmath188 and thus the squeezing operations @xmath169 and @xmath170 were chosen such that they effectively transform our scheme into the bk scheme .",
    "characterizing our teleportation protocol by the noise by which the mean number of photons in the input state is increased @xmath189 instead of the fidelity ( [ fqnd1 ] ) such a choice of @xmath169 and @xmath170 maximizes @xmath31 and therefore our improved scheme is optimal from the point of view of the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the analytical proof of the latter statement is given in the next section .",
    "we have seen that in some cases the application of suitable local squeezing operations on parts of the shared entangled state can improve considerably the efficiency of the cv teleportation . despite of the fact that both the squeezed state of a light beam @xcite and a squeezed state of an atomic sample @xcite were already realized",
    "experimentally it may be still an experimental challenge to implement the squeezing operations on parts of the entangled state .",
    "the obstacle can be partially avoided and alice s squeezing operation @xmath169 can be saved if one can adjust properly the interaction constant @xmath66 ( or the ratio @xmath67 ) in the bell measurement . to be more specific ,",
    "if in our case we put @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) the interaction in the bell measurement effectively realizes the needed squeezing operation @xmath169 .",
    "contrary to the operation @xmath169 the squeezing operation @xmath170 on bob s side is in general inevitable , in particular if one needs to preserve the whole quantum state @xmath69 for further processing .",
    "however , the squeezing operation @xmath170 can be avoided if the input state @xmath192 just carries some classical information encoded into its complementary quadratures @xmath0 and @xmath1 that is red from the output state @xmath69 immediately after the teleportation by homodyne measurement of either of the output quadratures @xmath193 or @xmath194 .",
    "namely , formally the operation @xmath170 can be moved behind the displacement transformation @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that then must be changed to @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the needed squeezing operation @xmath170 then can be realized merely as a scaling @xmath197 or @xmath198 of the classical outcomes @xmath199 and @xmath200 of the homodyne measurement .",
    "in this section we will prove analytically that the improvement of our previous unity gain teleportation scheme by local squeezing operations that effectively transform the scheme into the bk scheme is in a certain sense that is specified below optimal .",
    "for this reason , let us consider the generalization of the protocol depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the generalized scheme ,",
    "alice and bob share a gaussian state of two modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath201 with vanishing first moments , i. e. @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) , where @xmath204 is the column vector of the quadratures @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "such a state is completely characterized by the variance matrix @xmath205 with elements @xmath206 , where @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "we assume that alice and bob can apply locally on their parts of the shared state arbitrary single - mode linear transformations @xmath169 and @xmath170 of the quadratures @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) preserving the canonical commutation rules @xmath8=i\\delta_{ij}$ ] . in matrix notation",
    "these transformations can be expressed by the formulas @xmath211 where @xmath212 , @xmath213 ( @xmath210 ) and @xmath214 are real @xmath215 matrices satisfying the so called symplectic condition @xmath216 these transformations involve single - mode squeezers and phase shifters as particular instances and are conventionally denoted as symplectic transformations . then , alice performs the bell measurement .",
    "she lets her mode @xmath2 and the mode `` in '' to interact in a two - mode interaction @xmath217 described by the quadratic hamiltonian of the form @xmath218 , where @xmath219 are real coupling constants and @xmath220 ( @xmath221 ) are components of the column vector @xmath222 . in heisenberg picture the interaction is described by the two - mode linear symplectic transformation of the form @xcite : @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath217 is a real @xmath225 matrix satisfying the two - mode symplectic condition @xmath226 the two - mode symplectic transformations involve the unbalanced bs and qnd interaction ( [ hqnd ] ) as particular instances .",
    "after that alice completes the bell measurement by homodyne detection of the position quadrature @xmath227 on mode `` in '' and the momentum quadrature @xmath228 on mode @xmath2 . introducing the vector of the input quadratures @xmath229 the vector of the detected quadratures @xmath230 can be expressed as @xmath231 where @xmath232 where @xmath233 @xmath234 are elements of the matrix @xmath217 .",
    "alice measures certain classical values @xmath11 and @xmath12 and sends them via classical channel to bob who completes the teleportation by performing the displacements @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the c - number vector of the measurement results and @xmath237 is the matrix of the unnormalized gains . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the unity gain regime in which the first moments of the input state are preserved ( @xmath238 ) and therefore we chose @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the inverse matrix to the matrix @xmath241 that is assumed to be regular .",
    "hence , using eqs .",

    "the above analysis reveals that the use of a generic quadratic interaction @xmath251 in the bell measurement has two effects .",
    "first , in order our teleportation protocol to preserve the first moments of the input state bob musts the received classical outcomes of the bell measurement @xmath236 transform by the matrix of gains @xmath252 before using them for the displacements of his mode .",
    "for example , if the interaction @xmath251 is the qnd interaction @xmath253 considered in the previous section then @xmath254 is the diagonal matrix @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "second , the interaction @xmath251 performs effectively a symplectic transformation @xmath246 on alice s mode @xmath2 .",
    "now , consider the case when there are no auxiliary symplectic transformations on alice s and bob s sides ( @xmath257 ) and the state shared by alice and bob has the epr entanglement . in this case",
    ", the transformation @xmath246 entails that the actual added noises @xmath168 and @xmath249 do not match with the `` optimal '' added noises @xmath258 , @xmath259 and hence the amount of the noise added into the input state is larger in comparison with the `` optimal '' case .",
    "this undesirable effect of the transformation @xmath246 can be compensated by using an auxiliary symplectic transformation @xmath169 on mode @xmath2 of the form @xmath260 .",
    "for instance , if the bell measurement is realized by the qnd interaction @xmath50 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_qnd ] ) , then @xmath246 is the squeezing transformation @xmath261 and therefore @xmath262 .",
    "if , on the other hand , alice and bob share a state with other than epr entanglement and the interaction constant of the interaction in the bell measurement can be controlled it can be adjusted in such a way that the effective transformation @xmath246 matches ( on alice s side ) the actual added noises with the `` optimal '' added noises and thus enhances the teleportation fidelity . in the case of the entanglement produced by the qnd interaction ( [ hqnd ] ) of two",
    "vacuum states the matching is achieved if @xmath263 ( see sec .  [ sec_qnd ] ) .    before going further ,",
    "let us return for a while to the regularity requirement of the matrix @xmath241 given in eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) that emerged naturally when expressing the vector @xmath264 from eq .",
    "( [ detected ] ) .",
    "obviously , this property guarantees that the measured quadratures @xmath227 and @xmath228 carry information about both complementary quadratures of the input state and therefore the first moments @xmath265 and @xmath266 of the input state can be preserved as is a natural demand for any unity gain teleportation protocol .",
    "consequently , all the interactions yielding regular matrix @xmath241 can be used in our scheme for the bell measurement .",
    "for that reason we further restrict our attention to the interactions for which @xmath241 is a regular matrix .",
    "the quality of the cv teleportation protocols in a unity gain regime is well expressed quantitatively by the fidelity which is for pure input states defined as @xcite @xmath267 where @xmath268 and @xmath269 are wigner functions of the input and output state , respectively . assuming the input state , similarly as the shared state @xmath201 , to be described by a gaussian wigner function , expressing both the wigner functions @xmath270 and @xmath271 as fourier transforms of corresponding characteristic functions , carrying out all integrals and taking into account the relation @xmath238 following from the eq .",

    "<S> finally , our analysis reveals that the local symplectic operation on sender s side can be integrated into the bell measurement if the interaction constant of the interaction in the bell measurement can be adjusted properly .    quantum entanglement can be used for information carried by quantum objects to be processed in a unique way . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , entanglement enables a disembodied transfer of an unknown state of one quantum system to another system with precision that can not be achieved using only classical resources . </S>",
    "<S> this the so called quantum teleportation was first proposed theoretically @xcite and realized experimentally @xcite in the context of observables with discrete spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the studies of quantum teleportation did not restrict to the discrete variables but they were also extended by vaidman @xcite into the realm of physical quantities with continuous spectra  continuous variables . </S>",
    "<S> a feasible implementation of vaidman s continuous - variable ( cv ) teleportation protocol was then proposed by braunstein and kimble ( bk ) @xcite .    in the bk protocol </S>",
    "<S> the role of the cvs is played by the canonically conjugate variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the input cv system `` in '' and the state to be teleported is an unknown coherent state . at the beginning of the bk protocol a sender alice ( @xmath2 ) and a receiver bob ( @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> share a cv entangled state of two cv systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 described by the canonically conjugate variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8=i\\delta_{ij}$ ] ) . at the first stage </S>",
    "<S> , alice performs the so called bell measurement on the systems @xmath2 and `` in '' by superimposing them on a balanced beam splitter ( bs ) and detecting at its outputs the variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> she obtains certain classical values @xmath11 and @xmath12 and sends them via classical channel to bob . in order to recover the input variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 in his system bob amplifies the measurement results by the gain factor @xmath13 and performs the displacements @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as a result , bob s conjugate variables read as @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite and thus the input variables were teleported to bob with some added noises @xmath18 and @xmath19 . without entanglement </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob can achieve only limited quality of the teleportation . in the best case </S>",
    "<S> when the systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 are prepared in the vacuum states @xcite two vacuum units of noise are added into each of the input variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this noise limits the quality of the teleportation to the classical regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , the noise can be reduced and therefore the so called quantum regime of teleportation can be achieved if alice and bob use a specific entangled state that possesses quantum correlations of equal strength between canonically conjugate variables whose strength increases with increasing entanglement , i. e. @xmath20 for @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is a squeezing parameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , sharing this type of entanglement alice can teleport the input state to bob with arbitrarily high precision if the entanglement is sufficiently strong . </S>",
    "<S> this type of entanglement is called einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entanglement @xcite and can be prepared by mixing the systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 equally squeezed in conjugate variables @xmath4 and @xmath7 , respectively , on a balanced bs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to date , all the ingredients of the bk scheme encompassing beam splitters , squeezers and detectors of canonically conjugate variables were well managed only for light . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it was possible to demonstrate to date only cv quantum teleportation of light @xcite . in these experiments , the role of the cv systems was played by the single modes of an optical field and the cvs were realized by the quadrature amplitudes of the field . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , a great attention has been paid to the teleportation protocols for cvs of material objects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these protocols involve two kinds of cv systems : coherent linearly polarized light pulses and spin - polarized macroscopic atomic samples . </S>",
    "<S> the respective cvs @xmath4 and @xmath5 are for a light pulse @xmath2 realized by the properly normalized components of the operator of the stokes vector ; for an atomic sample @xmath3 the respective cvs @xmath6 and @xmath7 are realized by the properly normalized components of the collective spin operator of the atomic sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly as in the bk scheme , the protocols exploit the epr entanglement of two atomic samples @xcite or the epr entanglement of two light beams @xcite . however , the specific feature of the two systems involved in these protocols is that they interact naturally via the quantum - nondemolition ( qnd ) interaction @xcite described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coupling constant . as the bs interaction also </S>",
    "<S> the qnd interaction of two orthogonally squeezed vacuum states produces the epr entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , the qnd interaction produces the entangled state even from two vacuum states but this is no more the epr state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the use of such the qnd entangled state in the bk protocol will not lead to its optimal performance . for this reason horoshko and kilin ( hk ) @xcite studied the teleportation protocol based on sharing of the qnd entanglement and utilizing an unbalanced bs in the bell measurement </S>",
    "<S> they have shown that quantum regime of teleportation can be achieved if sufficiently strong qnd entanglement is available .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a generalized cv teleportation protocol that contains the hk protocol as a particular case . </S>",
    "<S> our protocol is based on the qnd entanglement and utilizes either the qnd interaction or an unbalanced bs in the bell measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we study both the non - unity gain and the unity gain regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the non - unity gain regime is characterized by the conditional variance product @xmath25 and the signal transfer coefficient @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown on two particular examples that for a fixed interaction in the bell measurement the parameter @xmath26 can be enhanced while preserving the parameter @xmath25 and thus the performance of our protocol can be improved by applying a suitable squeezing operation on alice s part of the shared entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> the unity gain regime is characterize by the fidelity @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the hk scheme our scheme allows to achieve quantum regime of teleportation when @xmath28 for arbitrarily small amount of the shared qnd entanglement . for a particular amount of the shared entanglement corresponding to the feasible interaction constant @xmath29 @xcite ( @xmath30 is the interaction time ) </S>",
    "<S> we show analytically that the use of a suitable unbalanced bs in the bell measurement provides a higher teleportation fidelity than the use of a balanced bs as proposed by hk . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was demonstrated in @xcite that in the teleportation protocol exploiting entanglement produced from a single squeezed state and a balanced bs in the bell measurement one can increase the teleportation fidelity by applying local squeezers on parts of the shared entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the fidelity in our scheme can be increased by application of local squeezing operations on both parts of the shared entangled state that convert effectively the scheme to the bk scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is proved analytically that if we characterize the unity gain teleportation by the noise @xmath31 by which the mean number of photons in the input state is increased during the teleportation then such a choice of the local operations is optimal .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_qnd ] </S>",
    "<S> we study a teleportation scheme utilizing the qnd entanglement as an entanglement resource and the qnd interaction or an unbalanced bs in the bell measurement . section  [ sec_generic ] deals with a generic cv teleportation scheme and the optimization of the noise @xmath31 with respect to the local symplectic transformations is performed . </S>",
