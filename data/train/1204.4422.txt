    "this puzzle has been the subject of a tremendous amount of experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "another probe of the structure of the nucleon is elastic electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "measurements made at jefferson lab have shown that the proton form factor ratio , @xmath0 , decreases as the value of @xmath1 is increased above about 1 gev@xmath2 .",
    "this important discovery renewed interest in the structure of the nucleon .",
    "the present paper is devoted to answering a simple question : can a model of the nucleon which consists of three valence quarks and a pion cloud , constrained by poincar invariance , describe the existing data for elastic electromagnetic form factors , while properly accounting for the small fraction of the proton total angular momentum carried by the quarks .",
    "recent work indicates that the successful construction of such a model should be possible  @xcite , provided the model quark wave functions have suitable properties .",
    "the challenge of understanding nucleon elastic form factors has been taken up by many , for example , see the review  @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we follow only one particular line of reasoning . the light - front model of ref .",
    "@xcite , with three constituent quarks , was used to predict the fall of the ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of the pion cloud were later included  @xcite , and this led to a reasonably accurate description of all four electromagnetic form factors .",
    "however , the quarks in the bare nucleon carry about 75% of the total angular momentum of the nucleon , which is too large to reproduce the measured value of approximately 30% .",
    "furthermore , the computed ratio @xmath0 falls a little too rapidly with increasing values of @xmath1 , and the results were not completely consistent with the detailed flavor decomposition of the empirical form factors  @xcite",
    ". this earlier work on the proton form factors was carried out with a very simple three - quark wave function . in the present work we use a more sophisticated wave function , consisting of a quark - scalar - diquark term and a quark - axial - vector - diquark term , with two invariant forms for each term .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : sect .",
    "[ sec : formal ] is devoted to a complete description of the model , including the light - front wave function ( lfwf ) and the addition of the pion cloud , along with the formalism necessary to compute observable quantities .",

    "the basic model is that the valence quarks , represented by quark - diquark combinations with the quantum numbers of the nucleon , are immersed in a cloud of pions .",
    "the motivation for this idea is obvious .",
    "we know that the nucleon is made of quarks and that there is a long range interaction between nucleons mediated by the exchange of a single pion .",
    "however , a pion emitted by a nucleon can be absorbed by the same nucleon , so each nucleon has a pion cloud .",
    "the low mass of the pion is the reason for singling it out as the only meson to be treated separately as a cloud  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , including the pion cloud leads to a significant reduction in the fraction of the nucleons total angular momentum carried by the quark spin , and this is consistent with previous findings  @xcite .",
    "we use the light - front representation of the nucleon wave function  @xcite to guarantee that the observable quantities have the appropriate properties under lorentz transformations .",
