    "parabosonic algebras have a long history both in theoretical and mathematical physics .",
    "although , formally introduced in the fifties by green @xcite , in the context of second quantization , their history traces back to the fundamental conceptual problems of quantum mechanics ; in particular to wigner s approach to first quantization @xcite .",

    "these are usually called  canonical variables \" .",
    "having determined the hamiltonian of the system , the dynamics is extracted through the well - known hamilton equations : @xmath5 the passage from the classical description to the quantum description , within the framework of the first quantization , consists of the following procedure : the functional dependence of the hamiltonian on the canonical variables is -roughly- retained but the canonical variables are no more real variables .",
    "instead they become elements of a unital associative non - commutative algebra , described in terms of the generators @xmath6 , @xmath3 and relations : @xmath7 = i \\hbar \\delta_{ij } i \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ q_{i } , q_{j } ] = [ p_{i } , p_{j } ] = 0\\ ] ] @xmath8 is of course the unity of the algebra and @xmath9 $ ] stands for @xmath10 .",
    "the states of the system are no more described as functions @xmath11 which are solutions of but rather as vectors of a hilbert space , where the elements of the above mentioned algebra act .",
    "the dynamics is now determined by the heisenberg equations of motion : @xmath12 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ i \\hbar \\frac{dp_{i}}{dt } = [ p_{i } , h]\\ ] ] we of course describe what is known as the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics .",
    "relations are known in the physical literature as the heisenberg algebra , or the heisenberg - weyl algebra or more commonly as the canonical commutation relations often abbreviated as ccr .",
    "their central importance for the quantization procedure formerly described , lies in the fact that if one accepts which however are general enough for simple physical systems ] the algebraic relations together with the quantum dynamical equations then it is an easy matter ( see @xcite ) to extract the classical hamiltonian equations of motion while on the other hand the acceptance of the classical equations together with reproduces the quantum dynamics exactly as described by . in this way",
    "the ccr emerge as a fundamental link between the classical and the quantum description of the dynamics .    for technical reasons it is common to use -instead of the variables",
    "@xmath4- the linear combinations : @xmath13 for @xmath14 in terms of which become ( we have set @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 =   \\delta_{ij } i \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ b_{i}^{- } , b_{j}^{- } ] = [ b_{i}^{+ } , b_{j}^{+ } ] = 0\\ ] ] for @xmath17 .",
    "these latter relations are usually called the bosonic algebra ( of n bosons ) , and in they case of the infinite degrees of freedom @xmath18 they become the starting point of the free field theory ( i.e. : second quantisation ) .",
    "the above mentioned approach to the first quantisation is actually the path followed by the founders of quantum mechanics such as dirac , born , heisenberg , schredinger and others .",
    "although it is not our aim to provide systematic references on this fascinating story , many of the original papers which paved the way can be found in @xcite .    in 1950",
    "wigner in a two page publication @xcite , noticed that what the above approach implies is that the ccr are sufficient conditions -but not necessary- for the equivalence between the classical hamiltonian equations and the heisenberg quantum dynamical equations . in a kind of reversing the problem",
    ", wigner posed the question of looking for necessary conditions for the simultaneous fulfillment of and .",
    "he stated an infinite set of solutions for the above mentioned problem ( although not claiming to have found the general solution ) .",
    "it is worth noting that ccr were included as one special case among wigner s infinite solutions .",
    "a few years latter in 1953 , green in his celebrated paper @xcite introduced the parabosonic algebra ( in possibly infinite degrees of freedom ) , by means of generators and relations : @xmath19 = 2\\delta_{km}b_{l}^{- }   \\\\             \\\\",

    "green was primarily interested in field theoretic implications of the above mentioned algebra , in the sense that he considered it as an alternative starting point for the second quantisation problem , generalizing .",
    "however , despite his original motivation he was the first to realize -see also @xcite- that wigner s infinite solutions were nothing else but inequivalent irreducible representations of the parabosonic algebra .",
    "( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .    in what follows , all vector spaces and algebras and all tensor products will be considered over the field of complex numbers .",
    "[ se:1 ]    the parabosonic algebra , was originally defined in terms of generators and relations by green @xcite and greenberg - messiah @xcite .",

    "@xmath50 is the unity of the bosonic algebra .",
    "based on the above definitions we prove now the following proposition which clarifies the relationship between bosonic and parabosonic algebras :    [ parabosonstobosons ] the parabosonic algebra @xmath34 and the bosonic algebra @xmath36 are both @xmath51-graded algebras with their generators @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , @xmath45 , being odd elements .",

    "it is obvious that the tensor algebra @xmath26 is a @xmath51-graded algebra with the monomials being homogeneous elements .",

    "the generators @xmath59 , @xmath60 are odd elements in the above mentioned gradation . in view of the above description",
    "we can easily conclude that the @xmath51-gradation of the tensor algebra is immediately  transfered \" to the algebras @xmath34 and @xmath36 : both ideals @xmath27 and @xmath28 are homogeneous ideals of the tensor algebra , since they are generated by homogeneous elements of @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the projection homomorphisms @xmath61 and @xmath62 are homogeneous algebra maps of degree zero , or we can equivalently say that they are even algebra homomorphisms . we can straightforwardly check that the bosons satisfy the paraboson relations , i.e : @xmath63 -   ( \\epsilon - \\eta)\\delta_{jk}x_{i}^{\\xi } - ( \\epsilon -   \\xi)\\delta_{ik}x_{j}^{\\eta } ) = \\\\                \\\\   = \\big [ \\ { b_{i}^{\\xi } ,   b_{j}^{\\eta}\\ } , b_{k}^{\\epsilon }   \\big ] -   ( \\epsilon - \\eta)\\delta_{jk}b_{i}^{\\xi } - ( \\epsilon -   \\xi)\\delta_{ik}b_{j}^{\\eta } = 0 \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] which simply means that : @xmath64 or equivalently : @xmath65 . by the correspodence theorem for rings , we get that the set @xmath66 is an homogeneous ideal of the algebra @xmath34 , and applying the third isomorphism theorem for rings we get : @xmath67",
    "thus we have shown that the bosonic algebra @xmath36 is a quotient algebra of the parabosonic algebra @xmath34 . the fact that @xmath65 implies that @xmath62 is uniquely extended to an even algebra homomorphism @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is determined by it s values on the generators @xmath52 of @xmath34 , i.e. : @xmath55 .",

    "what we actually mean is that @xmath78 , apart from being an algebra is also a @xmath79-module and at the same time it s structure maps ( i.e. : the multiplication and the unity map which embeds the field into the center of the algebra ) are @xmath79-module maps which is nothing else but homogeneous linear maps of degree @xmath82 ( i.e. : even linear maps ) .",
    "note , that under the above action , any element of @xmath78 decomposes uniquely as : @xmath83 .",
    "we can further summarize the above description saying that @xmath78 is an algebra in the braided monoidal category of @xmath79-modules @xmath84 .",
    "in this case the braiding is induced by the non - trivial quasitriangular structure of the @xmath79 hopf algebra i.e. by the non - trivial @xmath85-matrix : @xmath86 in the above relation @xmath87 are the elements of the @xmath51 group ( written multiplicatively ) .",
    "we digress here for a moment , to recall that ( see @xcite or @xcite ) if @xmath88 is a quasitriangular hopf algebra , then the category of modules @xmath89 is a braided monoidal category , where the braiding is given by a natural family of isomorphisms @xmath90 , given explicitly by : @xmath91 for any @xmath92 .",
    "by @xmath93 we denote any elements of @xmath94 respectively . + combining eq . and",
    "we immediately get the braiding in the @xmath84 category : @xmath95 in the above relation @xmath96 denotes the degree of an homogeneous element of either @xmath97 or @xmath98 ( i.e. : @xmath99 if @xmath56 is an even element and @xmath100 if @xmath56 is an odd element ) .",
    "this is obviously a symmetric braiding , since @xmath101 , so we actually have a symmetric monoidal category @xmath84 , rather than a truly braided one .",
    "the really important thing about the existence of the braiding is that it provides us with an alternative way of forming tensor products of @xmath51-graded algebras : if @xmath78 is a superalgebra with multiplication @xmath102 , then the super vector space @xmath103 ( with the obvious @xmath51-gradation ) equipped with the associative multiplication @xmath104 given by : @xmath105 ( @xmath106 homogeneous in @xmath78 ) , readily becomes a superalgebra ( or equivalently an algebra in the braided monoidal category of @xmath79-modules @xmath84 ) which we will denote : @xmath107 and call the braided tensor product algebra from now on .",
    "[ se:2 ]      the notion of @xmath76-graded hopf algebra , for @xmath76 a finite abelian group , is not a new one neither in physics nor in mathematics .",
    "the idea appears already in the work of milnor and moore @xcite , where we actually have @xmath108-graded hopf algebras . on the other hand , universal enveloping algebras of lie superalgebras",
    "are widely used in physics and they are examples of @xmath51-graded hopf algebras ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these structures are strongly resemblant of hopf algebras but they are not hopf algebras at least in the ordinary sense .    restricting again to the simplest case where @xmath109 we briefly recall this idea : an algebra @xmath78 being a @xmath51-graded hopf algebra ( or super - hopf algebra ) means first of all that @xmath78 is a @xmath51-graded associative algebra ( or : superalgebra ) .",
    "we now consider the braided tensor product algebra @xmath110 .",
    "then @xmath78 is equipped with a coproduct @xmath111 which is an superalgebra homomorphism from @xmath78 to the braided tensor product algebra @xmath110 : @xmath112 for any @xmath113 in @xmath78 , with @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , @xmath117 homogeneous .",
    "similarly , @xmath78 is equipped with an antipode @xmath118 which is not an algebra anti - homomorphism ( as in ordinary hopf algebras ) but a superalgebra anti - homomorphism ( or :  twisted \" anti - homomorphism or : braided anti - homomorphism ) in the following sense ( for any homogeneous @xmath119 ) : @xmath120 the rest of the axioms which complete the super - hopf algebraic structure ( i.e. : coassociativity , counity property , and compatibility with the antipode ) have the same formal description as in ordinary hopf algebras .",
    "once again , the abstraction of the representation theory of quasitriangular hopf algebras provides us with a language in which the above description becomes much more compact : we simply say that @xmath78 is a hopf algebra in the braided monoidal category of @xmath79-modules @xmath84 or : a braided group where the braiding is given in equation .",
    "what we actually mean is that @xmath78 is simultaneously an algebra , a coalgebra and a @xmath79-module , while all the structure maps of @xmath78 ( multiplication , comultiplication , unity , counity and the antipode ) are also @xmath79-module maps and at the same time the comultiplication @xmath121 and the counit are algebra morphisms in the category @xmath84 ( see also @xcite or @xcite for a more detailed description ) .",
    "+ we proceed now to the proof of the following proposition which establishes the super - hopf algebraic structure of the parabosonic algebra @xmath34 :      recall that by definition @xmath126 . consider the linear map : @xmath127 determined by it s values on the basis elements specified by : @xmath128 . by the universality of the tensor algebra this map is uniquely extended to a superalgebra homomorphism : @xmath129 .",

    "note here that in the case of the antipode @xmath136 we need the notion of the @xmath51-graded opposite algebra ( or : opposite superalgera ) @xmath137 , which is a superalgebra defined as follows : @xmath137 has the same underlying super vector space as @xmath34 , but the multiplication is now defined as : @xmath138 , for all @xmath139 .",
    "( in the right hand side , the product is of course the product of @xmath34 ) .",
    "we start by defining a linear map @xmath140 by : @xmath141 which is ( uniquely ) extended to a superalgebra homomorphism : @xmath142 .",
    "the fact that @xmath143 implies that @xmath136 is uniquely extended to a superalgebra homomorphism @xmath144 , thus to a superalgebra anti - homomorphism : @xmath145 with values on the generators determined by .",
    "now it is sufficient to verify the rest of the super - hopf algebra axioms ( coassociativity , counity and the compatibility condition for the antipode ) on the generators of @xmath34 .",
    "this can be done with straigthforward computations .",
    "let us note here , that the above proposition generalizes a result which -in the case of finite degrees of freedom- is a direct consequence of the work in @xcite . in that work the parabosonic algebra in @xmath146 generators ( @xmath147-paraboson algebra ) @xmath148",
    "is shown to be isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra : @xmath149 .",

    "now we can trivially verify that @xmath226 we also compute : @xmath227 -   ( \\epsilon - \\eta)\\delta_{jk}x_{i}^{\\xi } - ( \\epsilon -   \\xi)\\delta_{ik}x_{j}^{\\eta } ) = 0\\ ] ] relations , and , mean that @xmath228 which in turn implies that @xmath229 is uniquely extended as an algebra homomorphism from @xmath230 to the usual tensor product algebra @xmath223 , with the values on the generators determined by .",
    "+ following the same procedure we construct an algebra homomorphism @xmath231 and an algebra antihomomorphism @xmath232 which are completely determined by their values on the generators of @xmath203 ( i.e. : the basis elements of @xmath233 . note that in the case of the antipode we start by defining a linear map @xmath234 from @xmath235 to the opposite algebra @xmath236 , with values determined by : @xmath237 and @xmath238 . following the",
    "above described procedure we end up with an algebra anti - homomorphism : @xmath232 .",
    "+ now it is sufficient to verify the rest of the hopf algebra axioms ( i.e. : coassociativity of @xmath229 , counity property for @xmath239 , and the compatibility condition which ensures us that @xmath234 is an antipode ) on the generators of @xmath203 .",
    "this can be done with straightforward computations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us notice here , that the initiation for the above mentioned construction lies in the case of the finite degrees of freedom : if we consider the parabosonic algebra in @xmath146 generators ( @xmath147-paraboson algebra ) and denote it @xmath148 , it is possible to construct explicit realizations of the elements @xmath204 and @xmath205 in terms of formal power series , such that the relations specified in hold .",
    "the construction is briefly ( see also @xcite ) as follows : we define @xmath240 we inductively prove : @xmath241 = b_{i}^{+}((\\mathcal{n } + 1)^{m } - \\mathcal{n}^{m})\\ ] ] we now introduce the following elements : @xmath242 utilizing the above power series expressions and equation we get @xmath243 a direct application of the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula leads also to : @xmath244 finally let us make a few comments on the above mentioned constructions .    from the point of view of the structure ,",
    "an obvious question arises : while @xmath196 is a quasitriangular hopf algebra through the @xmath85-matrix : @xmath181 given in eq . , there is yet no suitable @xmath85-matrix for the hopf algebra @xmath203 .",
    "thus the question of the quasitriangular structure of @xmath203 is open .    on the other hand , regarding representations , we have already noted that the super representations of @xmath34 ( @xmath51-graded modules of @xmath34 or equivalently : @xmath34-modules in @xmath84 ) are in @xmath245 correspodence with the ( ordinary ) representations of @xmath196 .",
    "although we do not have such a strong result for the representations of @xmath203 , the preceding construction in the case of finite degrees of freedom enables us to uniquely extend the fock - like representations of @xmath148 to representations of @xmath246 .",
    "since the fock - like representations of @xmath34 are unique up to unitary equivalence ( see the proof in @xcite or @xcite ) , this is a point which deserves to be discussed analytically in a forthcoming work ."
