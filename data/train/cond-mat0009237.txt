    "the evolution of fermi surface ( fs ) and electronic spectrum in the normal state of high temperature superconductors are intensively studied at present .",
    "recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies indicate different dispersion relations in the insulating and optimally doped cuprates .",
    "the undoped compounds @xcite show an isotropic band bottom close to @xmath0 in momentum space , a large energy difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and a so - called remnant fermi surface @xcite ( that surface where the single particle spectral weight shows a sudden drop of intensity ) . in the optimally",
    "doped compounds a flat band region , a large fs centered at @xmath3 and a so - called shadow fermi surface due to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin correlations @xcite are found @xcite .",
    "the flat band region has the form of an extended saddle point which stretches in the direction @xmath4-@xmath5 .",
    "the shadow fs resembles the main fs but is shifted by the afm vector @xmath6 furthermore , the underdoped compounds demonstrate the existence of a high energy pseudogap near the point @xmath7 with an energy of about @xmath8 ev @xcite . assuming a simple rigid band filling , the isotropic minimum of the undoped compounds would suggest small hole pockets around @xmath1 . however , there are no clear experimental indications for them @xcite and the fermi surface seems to develop in an arc - like fashion @xcite .",
    "it is a real theoretical problem to reconcile that seeming contradiction which can be attacked only by considering the spectral density evolution as a whole .",
    "there are numerous studies of the hole spectrum in two dimensional ( 2d ) doped antiferromagnets using a wealth of theoretical models , like the generalized @xmath9-@xmath10 , the effective three - band model , the kondo - lattice or the hubbard model .",
    "most of those studies are restricted to a very low hole concentration using the exact diagonalization of small clusters @xcite , the quantum monte carlo technique @xcite , the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) @xcite or a `` string '' ansatz for the hole wave function @xcite .",
    "one can start either from the two - sublattice nel - type state @xcite or from the spin rotationally invariant spin liquid state @xcite and obtain qualitatively the same result : the hole motion takes place mainly on one sublattice , i.e.  the dispersion relation is dominated by an effective hopping to the next nearest neighbors and the dispersion has its minimum at @xmath1 for small doping .",
    "there are much less attempts to explain the fermi surface evolution , like for instance @xcite which used a diagrammatic method combined with a semi - phenomenological spin susceptibility .",
    "the exact diagonalization studies ( on clusters containing up to @xmath11 sites ) at finite hole doping @xcite have difficulties to reconstruct the fs and to investigate a sufficiently smooth variation of doping due to the restricted set of @xmath12-points .",
    "the approach which shall be presented here is semi - phenomenological as well .",
    "on one hand , we start with the spin - fermion model ( the reduced form of the three - band emery model ) that has a clear microscopic basis @xcite .",
    "we also include direct oxygen - oxygen hopping terms which are rather important . on the other hand",
    ", we simulate the doping by a frustration term @xmath13 in addition to the nearest neighbor exchange @xmath14 of the spin part in the hamiltonian .",
    "the similarity between doping and frustration had been first proposed in @xcite based on a similar decrease of the magnetic correlation length .",
    "it is interesting to note that cluster calculations indicated a considerable value of the frustration parameter @xmath15 even for the undoped la@xmath16cuo@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "of course there is no full equivalence between doping and frustration .",
    "for example , the doped @xmath9-@xmath10 model and the frustrated @xmath14-@xmath13 model give different results for the dynamical spin - spin structure factor and for the spectrum of raman scattering @xcite .",
    "but numerical calculations on finite lattices indicate the equivalence of the mentioned models if we are interested in the static spin - spin correlation functions @xcite .",
    "and those quantities are especially relevant in our present green s function method where the spectrum @xmath18 is determined by the static spin - spin correlation functions of the spin subsystem .",
    "previous studies of the frustrated generalized @xmath9-@xmath10 @xcite and the frustrated effective three - band model @xcite demonstrated already the strong influence of frustration on the spin - polaron spectrum . however , these investigations were performed only within the local polaron approach ( lpa ) which can not describe the influence of long range spin order on the excitation spectrum .",
    "furthermore , only the bare spectral weight was considered which could only give a hypothetical fs .",
    "recently @xcite the frustrated @xmath19 model was discussed in the framework of the scba where the holes are treated as spinless fermions and the spins as normal bosons @xcite .",
    "the resulting scba in corresponds to a two sublattice approach in which the spectrum is dictated by the symmetry of the reduced magnetic brillouin zone ( bz ) ( e.g. the points @xmath20 and @xmath21 are equivalent ) .",
    "however , such a symmetry is not reproduced in the arpes data .",
    "on the contrary , the spherically symmetric approach ( in the spin space ) is used in the present investigation to describe the spin subsystem . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum is periodic relative to the full brillouin zone ( bz ) of the cuo@xmath16 plane .",
    "the distinctive feature of our present investigation consists in treating the spin - polaron as a complex quasiparticle , i.e.  as a superposition of spin polaron states with different radii @xcite .",
    "our basis operators enclose the local polaron ( bare holes and the zhang - rice polaron ) and also its coupling to spin waves with quasimomentum @xmath22 close to the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath23 . by introducing the complex structure of the spin - polaron",
    "one may describe the important splitting of the lowest local polaron band .",
    "this allows , for example , to reproduce for heavily underdoped compounds a sudden drop in the intensity of arpes peaks as @xmath12 goes from @xmath1 to @xmath21 . and",
    "we will show that it reproduces also many of the other features of electronic structure evolution mentioned above .",
    "the main features of the hole motion in the @xmath24 plane are described by the model @xcite :    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 are the antiferromagnetic interactions between the first - nearest neighbor ( @xmath29 ) and the second - nearest neighbor ( @xmath30 ) on a square lattice .",

    "we do not introduce the explicit relative phases of @xmath42- and @xmath43 -orbitals since they can be transformed out by redefining the operators with phase factors @xmath44 . in order to compare our results with other authors and with experiment we restore these phases by changing in the final results @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the frustration parameter @xmath42 : @xmath47 the frustration parameter @xmath42 has to be connected with the number @xmath48 of holes per copper atom .",
    "we are guided by an estimate based on the single - band hubbard model with realistic values of @xmath49 for @xmath50 where one finds a value of @xmath51 .",
    "let us note that in the case of la@xmath52sr@xmath53cuo@xmath17 the spin system of the cuo@xmath16 plane looses its long - range order for @xmath54 .",
    "the adopted effective spin - fermion hamiltonian can be obtained by canonical transformation from the emery model @xcite in the regime @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the coulomb repulsion on copper sites .",
    "the values of the energy parameter set @xmath58 , @xmath9 , u@xmath59 may be extracted from band structure or cluster calculations .",

    "we consider a spin - liquid state with spin rotational symmetry for the copper subsystem , e.g. the spin - spin correlation functions satisfy the relation @xmath72    to treat the problem of a spin - polaron in the projection method approach we introduce a finite set of basis operators connected with each cell @xmath38 : @xmath73 ( with spin @xmath74 ) , where @xmath75 is the number of the operator , @xmath76 .",

    "we introduce the retarded two - time green s functions @xmath80 defined in terms of the fourier transforms @xmath81 of the operators @xmath82 : @xmath83 @xmath84 the equations of motion for the fourier transforms of the green s functions have the form @xmath85 \\ ; .",

    "the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath18 is determined by the poles of the green s function @xmath93 and can be derived from the condition @xmath94",
    "at first we choose a set of three basis operators which describe local spin - polaron states @xmath95 the combinations of them constitute the zhang - rice polaron and bare hole states , in particular : @xmath96 the spectrum of elementary excitations in the framework of the local polaron approach ( lpa ) was investigated previously @xcite . in particular it was pointed out that the frustration in spin subsystem and oxygen - oxygen hopping can explain the appearance of an extended saddle - point in the spectrum .",
    "the main shortcoming of lpa consists in the fact that the spectrum of elementary excitations depends only on the short range spin - spin correlation functions even at zero temperature .",
    "this means that lpa does not describe the influence of spin long range order on the excitation spectrum .    treating the periodic kondo problem on a square lattice in the two sublattice spin structure ,",
    "schrieffer @xcite emphasized the crucial importance of taking into account coherence factors related to the existence of long range order . in this model",

    "@xcite the mean - field approach was taken for the nel state at @xmath100 and the spins were treated as classical vectors : @xmath101 in this approximation the kondo - interaction hamiltonian ( [ p3 ] ) takes the form of a potential energy with doubled period . as a result , this interaction leads to the hybridization of bare particle states with momenta @xmath12 and @xmath102 and one should perform a standard @xmath103 transformation to take into account this hybridization from the very beginning . in the adopted nel state",
    "the amplitude @xmath104 of the spin wave with @xmath105 *  * ( the @xmath23-wave ) has a macroscopic large value and has properties analogous to the amplitude of a bose particle with zero momentum in the superfluid bose - gas . as a result",
    ", this amplitude can be treated as a @xmath106number for many problems",
    ". then the hybridization corresponds to coupling of the @xmath23-wave to local electron states .",
    "but it does not represent new states and leads only to mixing of states with momenta @xmath12 and @xmath102 .",
    "the distinctive feature of the present investigation consists in considering the one - particle motion on the background of the spherically symmetric spin subsystem state . in this background the average value @xmath107 and",
    "the above mentioned treatment fails . at @xmath100 and without frustration the only value which can be treated as a macroscopic one is @xmath108 .",

    "such states were introduced in @xcite and have the form @xmath111 @xmath112 it was shown in @xcite that it is important to take into account the quantum nature of the spin @xmath23-wave because the transitions between the local polaron states and the delocalized polaron states lead to a splitting of the lowest lpa bands and change their properties in an essential way . only the complex spin - polaron approach , i.e. that approach containing the local spin - polaron operators _ plus _ those operators dressed by the @xmath113-wave , can be compared with a green s function calculation for the bare hole spectral function @xmath114 taking into account the spin - polaron damping by means of the scba @xcite .",
    "one can see that the scba quasiparticle peak and its intensity are well given by the lowest band of the complex spin - polaron approach , whereas the excited bands reflect the non - coherent part of @xmath114 .    in the present paper",

    ", the spin subsystem looses its long - range order and the average value @xmath116 is zero .",
    "so one must introduce new operators in order to preserve the complex spin - polaron results and to take into account a finite spin correlation length @xmath117 .",
    "it is natural to generalize the above choice of operators by introducing local polaron states dressed by spin waves with momenta @xmath22 close to the antiferromagnetic vector @xmath23 ( for such @xmath22 the spin- spin structure factor is sharply peaked even at @xmath118 ) .",

    "the coupling radius of a spin polaron must be of the order of the spin correlation length @xmath140 .",

    "an analogous branch ( but without energy shift ) was recently reported for underdoped @xmath245 @xcite and it was treated as the shadow band first observed in ref .  @xcite . for the optimally doped compounds",
    "the presence of this band can be important for the plasma frequency at about @xmath246 ev if one takes into account the corresponding interband transitions .",
    "let us mention that in the ordinary band theory such transitions start at high energy @xmath247 ev and lead only to a constant contribution in the static dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "our calculations reproduce also the extended saddle point which is stretched in the direction from @xmath7 to @xmath236 close to the fs ( see fig .",
    "such an extended saddle point is observed in the photoemission data of optimally doped compounds and there has been a lot of speculations that it is important to the physics of the superconductors @xcite .",
    "note that for this flat band region ( close to @xmath248-point ) the bare carrier spectral weight @xmath209 is not small and is close to @xmath249 see fig.1.6.b .",
    "the underdoped case is represented in figs .",
    "1.3 , 2.3 with @xmath250 , @xmath251 and in figs .  1.4 , 2.4 ( @xmath250 , @xmath252 ) .",
    "as we move from doping 0.02 to doping 0.11 ( compare in consecutive order figs .",
    "1.2.b , 1.3.b and 1.4.b ) , the topology of lines with equal spectral weight changes dramatically .",
    "the remnant fs disappears , there appears finite spectral weight @xmath209 close to the @xmath21 point , the curvatures of lines change sign in a broad region and the spectral weight along the cut @xmath253 decreases . between @xmath7 and @xmath254 the spectral weight is transferred to the second band .",
    "since that is also the region where the fs crosses the @xmath7-@xmath21-line with increasing doping , the @xmath209 spectral weight along the fs is strongly changed .",
    "such a strong decrease of spectral weight as @xmath12 moves along the fs from the central region around @xmath0 to points close to @xmath255 can be treated as the opening of a high energy pseudogap near the point @xmath256 .",
    "this pseudogap @xmath257 is often determined as @xmath258 ( see @xcite ) . in our underdoped case ( @xmath259 ) @xmath260 is small and the first band should be only weakly present at the @xmath7 point in arpes .",
    "so , we must treat @xmath261 as @xmath262 in the expression for the gap @xmath263 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "then for the adopted above value @xmath220 ev the value of the pseudogap is equal to @xmath264 ev in accordance with arpes results ( @xmath8 ev @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the spectral weight @xmath260 on doping given in table 1 is non monotonic . at first , a strong drop of",
    "@xmath260 takes place in the underdoped region , but the spectral weight is sufficiently large in the optimally doped regime .",
    "such a behavior reflects the arpes scenario for a decreasing pseudogap as the doping increases from @xmath265 to @xmath266 .",
    "the evolution of the lowest band dispersion shows that in the just mentioned transition region also the formation of the extended saddle point takes place close to the @xmath248-point . as the doping increases above @xmath252 this flat band region",
    "is preserved .    for any doping ,",
    "the particle spectral weight @xmath209 for @xmath12 close to the @xmath1 point is large and nearly constant @xmath267 , see table 1 . and",
    "indeed , in this @xmath12-region the arpes experiments demonstrate the position of the fs surface with a well pronounced quasiparticle peak .",
    "accordingly , the second band in this @xmath12-region gives a small value @xmath268 ( a small incoherent part ) at any doping .",

    "the derived energies ( @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 ) are given in units of @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath221 denotes the spectral weight of the first or second band , respectively .",
    "we presented a semi - phenomenological approach to describe the evolution of fermi surface and electronic structure with doping .",
    "the approach is based on the spin - fermion model for the cuo@xmath16 plane and simulates the doping by a frustration term in the spin hamiltonian .",
    "it shows a strong alteration of the electronic structure which is due to a simple and natural mechanism : doping leads to frustration in the spin subsystem and to the variation of spin - spin correlation functions , and correspondingly to the non - rigid behavior of the spectrum .",
    "our theory explains the isotropic band bottom , the large energy difference between @xmath1 and @xmath7 @xcite and the remnant fs @xcite of the undoped compounds . in the optimally doped case",
    "it shows a flat band region ( an extended saddle point ) between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , a large fs @xcite and it shows signatures of a shadow fs @xcite .",
    "we find in the underdoped region a rather strong change of dispersion and spectral weight at the fs near @xmath7 .",
    "this finding can also be interpreted in terms of a pseudogap @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results would suggest for very low doping a fs in the form of small hole pockets ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "however , the spectral weights at those parts of the fs which are close to @xmath21 are rather small .",
    "this might be a reason which hinders its observation in arpes .",
    "in underdoped samples we find a transition to a large fs but with very small spectral weight near @xmath255 .",
    "accordingly , we would interpret the fermi surface arcs @xcite as those parts of the fs with large spectral weight .",
    "we find the parts of the fs with large spectral weight near to @xmath1 to be remarkable stable with doping despite the tremendous changes in other parts of the bz .",
    "there are several possible improvements of the approach presented here .",
    "a straightforward way consists in introducing of several non overlapping domains @xmath275 instead of the single domain @xmath276 ( see also @xcite ) . as a result",
    "such an extension of the operator set should lead to a better description of the incoherent part of the spectral function .",
    "it might also lead to a better description of the shadow fs and to a more abrupt change of the spectral density along the fs in the underdoped case , i.e.  a better description of the pseudogap .",
