    "in recent years the effect of electron correlations on the physics of meso- and nanoscopic systems has attracted growing interest .",
    "this led to an increasing overlap of the two communities working on mesoscopic physics and strongly correlated electron systems . in this article",
    "we focus on electronic transport properties , in particular the linear response conductance @xmath0 .",
    "as discussed below two very fundamental correlation effects should be observable in transport through mesoscopic systems of relatively simple structure : ( i ) the kondo effect@xcite in single quantum dots@xcite and ( ii ) luttinger liquid ( ll ) physics in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wires with a single impurity.@xcite    the progress in nanostructuring techniques makes it now possible to design more complex geometries such as double- and triple - dot systems@xcite and junctions of several quasi 1d wires.@xcite in these systems one can expect to find even more interesting correlation physics . in the near future complex setups might be used in conventional devices as well as for quantum information processing which provides a second reason to investigate the role of correlations .",
    "the theoretical tools commonly used to study many - body physics in dots and wires are rather specific to simple setups and can not directly be applied to more complex geometries .",
    "thus , there is need for novel techniques which can properly describe correlations , but are flexible and simple enough such that they can be used to investigate complex systems . in this article",
    ", we show that an approximation scheme which is based on the functional renormalization group@xcite ( frg ) provides such a method",
    ". we will first apply it to the two simple setups mentioned above and show that it contains the essential physics .",
    "we then proceed and study a system of parallel double - dots and a y - junction of three 1d quantum wires . in both examples",
    "the electron correlations lead to surprising new effects .    to exemplify the importance of correlations we first study transport through a quantum dot with spin degenerate levels . for simplicity",
    "we only consider a single level ( e.g.  described by the single impurity anderson model@xcite ) and equal couplings to the left and right lead .",
    "the level position can be moved by a gate voltage @xmath1 . at small @xmath2 and for noninteracting dot",
    "electrons @xmath3 shows a lorentzian resonance of unitary height @xmath4 .",
    "the full width @xmath5 of the resonance sets an energy scale @xmath6 which is associated with the strength of the tunneling barriers . including a coulomb interaction @xmath7 between the spin up and down dot electrons the line shape is substantially altered as can be seen from the exact @xmath8 bethe ansatz solution.@xcite for increasing @xmath9 it is gradually transformed into a box - shaped resonance of unitary height with a plateau of width @xmath7 and a sharp decrease of @xmath0 to the left and right of it.@xcite for gate voltages within the plateau the dot is half - filled implying a local spin-1/2 degree of freedom on the dot .",
    "thus , the kondo effect@xcite leads to resonant transport throughout this so - called kondo regime .",
    "the appearance of the plateau can be understood by studying the characteristics of the one - particle spectral function of the dot . for the present setup",
    "@xmath3 is proportional to the spectral weight at the chemical potential @xmath10.@xcite for sufficiently large @xmath9 the spectral function shows a sharp kondo resonance ( and additional hubbard bands at higher energies ) .",
    "its width sets an energy scale  the kondo temperature @xmath11.@xcite at half - filling ( @xmath12 ) the peak is located at the chemical potential , but even for gate voltages away from the particle - hole symmetric point it is pinned at @xmath10 and its height barely changes .",
    "this holds for @xmath13 , which explains the appearance of the plateau of width @xmath7 in the conductance .",
    "experimentally the appearance of kondo physics in transport through quantum dots was demonstrated clearly.@xcite    although local correlations in a quantum dot ( i.e.  a zero - dimensional system ) already have a strong effect , the system remains a fermi liquid .",
    "however , the low - energy physics of correlated 1d metals ( quantum wires ) is not described by the fermi liquid theory .",
    "such systems fall into the ll universality class@xcite which is characterized by power - law scaling of a variety of correlation functions and a vanishing quasi - particle weight . for spin - rotational invariant interactions and spinless models , on which we focus here",
    ", the exponents of the different correlation functions can be parametrized by a single number , the interaction dependent ll parameter @xmath14 ( for repulsive interactions ; @xmath15 in the noninteracting case ) . instead of being quasi - particles the low lying excitations of lls are collective density excitations .",
    "this implies that impurities , or more generally inhomogeneities , have a dramatic effect on the physical properties of lls.@xcite in the presence of only a single impurity on asymptotically small energy scales observables behave as if the 1d system was cut in two halfs at the position of the impurity , with open boundary conditions at the end points ( open chain fixed point).@xcite within a renormalization group approach the impurity increases from weak to strong . for a weak impurity and decreasing energy scale @xmath16say the temperature @xmath2the deviation of the linear conductance @xmath0 from the impurity - free value first scales as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the scaling dimension of the perfect chain fixed point and @xmath19 a characteristic energy scale ( e.g.  the band width )",
    "this holds as long as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being a measure for the strength of the @xmath22 backscattering of the impurity and @xmath23 the fermi momentum . for smaller energy scales or larger",
    "bare impurity backscattering this behavior crosses over to another power - law scaling @xmath24 , with the scaling dimension of the open chain fixed point @xmath25 .",
    "this scenario was verified within an effective field theoretical model for infinite lls@xcite as well as finite lls connected to fermi liquid leads.@xcite in the latter case the scaling holds as long as the contacts are modeled to be `` perfect '' , that is free of any bare and effective single - particle backscattering , and the impurity is placed in the bulk of the interacting quantum wire .",
    "indications of power - law scaling of @xmath26 were obtained in experiments on quasi 1d wires , but the results are ambiguous.@xcite one reason for this is that experimentally the power - law behavior is restricted to less than one order of magnitude and often only achieved after a somewhat uncontrolled background subtraction on the data .",
    "the frg was recently introduced as a powerful new tool for studying interacting fermi systems.@xcite it provides a systematic way of resumming competing instabilities and goes beyond simple perturbation theory even in problems which are not plagued by infrared divergences.@xcite in our applications the dot(s ) as well as the interacting quantum wire(s ) will be coupled to noninteracting leads as it is the case in systems which can be realized in experiments . before setting up the frg scheme we integrate out the leads.@xcite in the frg procedure the noninteracting propagator @xmath27 ( now including self - energy contributions from the leads ) is replaced by a propagator depending on an infrared cutoff @xmath28 .",
    "specifically , we use @xmath29 with @xmath28 running from @xmath30 down to @xmath31 . using @xmath32 in the generating functional of the irreducible vertex functions and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath28",
    "one can derive an exact , infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations for the vertex functions , such as the self - energy and the irreducible 2-particle interaction . in particular , the flow of the self - energy @xmath33 ( 1-particle vertex ) is determined by @xmath33 itself and the 2-particle vertex @xmath34 , while the flow of @xmath34 is determined by @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the flowing 3-particle vertex @xmath35 .",
    "the latter could be computed from a flow equation involving the 4-particle vertex , and so on . at the end of the frg flow",
    "@xmath36 is the self - energy @xmath37 of the original , cutoff - free problem we are interested in.@xcite a detailed derivation of the frg flow equations for a general quantum many - body problem which only requires a basic knowledge of the functional integral approach to many - particle physics and the application of the method for a simple toy problem are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in practical applications",
    "the hierarchy of flow equations has to be truncated and @xmath36 only provides an approximation for the exact @xmath37 . as a first approximation we here neglect the 3-particle vertex .",
    "the contribution of @xmath35 to @xmath34 is small as long as @xmath34 is small , because @xmath35 is initially ( at @xmath38 ) zero and is generated only from terms of third order in @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 stays small for all @xmath28 if the bare interaction is not too large .",
    "below we will clarify the meaning of `` not - too - large '' in the cases of interest .",
    "this approximation leads to a closed set of equations for @xmath34 and @xmath39.@xcite we here do not give these equations but instead implement a second approximation : the frequency - dependent flow of the renormalized 2-particle vertex @xmath34 is replaced by its value at vanishing ( external ) frequencies , such that @xmath34 remains frequency independent . since the bare interaction is frequency",
    "independent , neglecting the frequency dependence leads to errors only at second order for the self - energy , and at third order for the 2-particle vertex at zero frequency . for the approximate flow equations we then obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 \\big\\ } \\ ; , \\label{finalflowgamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lower indexes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc .",

    "now the set of flow equations can be used to study the two - lead single impurity anderson model.@xcite after integrating out the leads the only relevant single - particle quantum number is the spin @xmath47 of the dot electrons . if we take the level energies to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes a magnetic field which lifts the spin - degeneracy , the projected noninteracting propagator in the so - called wide band limit is given by@xcite @xmath51 where on the right - hand side @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    during the frg flow @xmath33 remains frequency independent and @xmath54 can be interpreted as an effective , flowing level position , whose flow equation reads @xmath55 with the initial condition @xmath56 and @xmath57 denoting the complement of @xmath47 .",

    "<S> we investigate how two - particle interactions affect the electronic transport through meso- and nanoscopic systems of two different types : quantum dots with local coulomb correlations and quasi one - dimensional quantum wires of interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> a recently developed functional renormalization group scheme is used that allows to investigate systems of complex geometry . considering simple setups </S>",
    "<S> we show that the method includes the essential aspects of luttinger liquid physics ( one - dimensional wires ) as well as of the physics of local correlations , with the kondo effect being an important example . for more complex systems of coupled dots and y - junctions of interacting wires </S>",
    "<S> we find surprising new correlation effects . </S>"
