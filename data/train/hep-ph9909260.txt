    "curiously enough , the most model independent prediction of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model concerns a standard particle : the mass @xmath4 of the ( lightest cp even ) higgs boson . within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) its mass is bounded , at tree level , by    m_h^2 m_z^2 ^2 2    where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 couples to up - type quarks in our convention ) .",
    "it has been realized already some time ago that loop corrections weaken this upper bound @xcite .",
    "these loop corrections depend on the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath7 and the soft susy breaking parameters as the stop masses of @xmath8 . at the one loop level , given the present experimental errors on the top mass @xmath9 and assuming @xmath10  tev , the upper limit on @xmath4 is @xmath11  gev .",
    "also two loop corrections to @xmath4 have been considered in the mssm @xcite ; these have the tendency to lower the upper bound on @xmath4 by @xmath0  gev .",
    "the subject of the present paper is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( ( m+1)ssm ) @xcite where a gauge singlet superfield @xmath12 is added to the higgs sector .",
    "it allows to omit the so - called @xmath13 term @xmath14 in the superpotential of the mssm , and to replace it by a yukawa coupling ( plus a singlet self coupling ) :    w = s h_1 h_2 + s^3 +  [ supot ]    the superpotential ( [ supot ] ) is thus scale invariant , and the electroweak scale appears only through the susy breaking terms .    in view of ongoing higgs searches at lep2 @xcite and , in the near future , at tevatron run",

    ", however , not the end of the story : it is well known @xcite that now the lightest higgs scalar @xmath29 can be dominantly a gauge singlet state . in this case it decouples from the gauge bosons and becomes invisible in higgs production processes , and the lightest _ visible _ higgs boson is then actually the second lightest one @xmath30 .",
    "fortunately , under these circumstances @xmath30 can not be too heavy @xcite : in the extreme case of a pure singlet lightest higgs , the mass @xmath31 of the next - to - lightest higgs scalar is again below the upper limit designed originally for @xmath15 .",
    "in general , however , mixed scenarios can be realized , with a weakly coupled ( but not pure singlet ) lightest higgs , and a second lightest higgs above the previous @xmath15 limits .",
    "although analyses of the higgs sector including these scenarios in the ( m+1)ssm have been presented before @xcite we find that these should be improved : first , experimental errors on the top quark pole mass @xmath32  gev @xcite have been reduced considerably , leading to stronger constraints on the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath7 which determines to a large extent the radiative corrections to @xmath33 .",
    "second , at least the dominant two loop corrections to the effective potential should be taken into account , since they are not necessarily negligible .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is thus an analysis of the allowed masses and couplings to the gauge bosons of the lightest cp even higgs scalars in the ( m+1)ssm , including present constraints on @xmath9 and a two loop improvement of the higgs potential .    in the next section we present our method of obtaining the dominant two loop terms in the effective potential , and in section  [",
    "sec : lhm ] we give the resulting upper bound on the lightest higgs mass .",
    "albeit this upper limit can be obtained analytically , the mass of the second lightest higgs in relation to the coupling to the gauge bosons requires a numerical analysis .",

    "subsequently the quantum corrections to the following terms in @xmath43 will play a role :    corrections to the kinetic terms of the higgs bosons . due to gauge invariance",

    "our results in section 5 are based on the effective potential _ including _ these contributions ( which are not necessarily numerically irrelevant ) , and there is no need to perform the decomposition of the radiative corrections to the effective potential explicitely .",

    "( [ mstop ] ) , it is obvious that , in the assumed limit @xmath139 , the assumption of maximal stop mixing ( @xmath140 ) can not be maintained for    m_t < m_susy < m_t ,    because it would imply a negative stop mass squared . therefore ,",
    "in the general ( m+1)ssm , we choose @xmath124 in this regime such that the lightest stop mass squared remains positive . on the other hand , within the c(m+1)ssm , where soft susy breaking terms are related , the limit @xmath35 small is not feasable since it would contradict the negative results on sparticle searches .    as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the upper limit on @xmath15 is not necessarily physically relevant , since the coupling of the lightest higgs to the @xmath45 boson can be very small .",
    "actually , this phenomenon can also appear in the mssm , if @xmath141 is small .",
    "however , the cp odd higgs boson @xmath142 is then necessarily light ( @xmath143 at tree level ) , and the process @xmath144 can be used to cover this region of the parameter space in the mssm . in the ( m+1)ssm",
    ", a small gauge boson coupling of the lightest higgs @xmath29 is usually related to a large gauge singlet component , in which case no ( strongly coupled ) light cp odd higgs boson is available .",
    "hence , higgs searches in the ( m+1)ssm have possibly to rely on the search for the second lightest higgs scalar @xmath30 .",
    "let us now define @xmath145 as the square of the coupling @xmath146 divided by the corresponding standard model higgs coupling :    r_i = ( s_i1 + s_i2)^2    where @xmath147 are the @xmath148 components of the cp even higgs boson @xmath149 , respectively . evidently , we have @xmath150 and unitarity implies    _ i=1 ^ 3 r_i = 1 .",
    "[ rsum ]    fortunately , as it was already mentionned , in the extreme case @xmath151 the upper limit on @xmath31 is the same as the above upper limit on @xmath15 . on the other hand , scenarios with ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath152 are possible . in the following",
    "we will discuss these situations in detail .",
    "we are interested in upper limits on the two lightest cp even higgs bosons @xmath153 .",
    "these are obtained in the limit where the third higgs , @xmath154 , is heavy and decouples , i.e. @xmath155 ( this is the equivalent of the so called decoupling limit in the mssm : the upper bound on the lightest higgs @xmath156 is saturated when the second higgs @xmath157 is heavy and decouples ) .",
    "hence , we have @xmath158 .    in the regime @xmath159 experiments",
    "will evidently first discover the lightest higgs ( with @xmath136  gev for @xmath135  tev ) .",
    "the worst case scenario in this regime corresponds to @xmath160  gev , @xmath161 ; the presence of a higgs boson with these properties has to be excluded in order to test this part of the parameter space of the general ( m+1)ssm .",
    "the regime where @xmath162 ( and hence @xmath163 ) is more delicate : here the lightest higgs may escape detection because of its small coupling , and it may be easier to detect the second lightest higgs . in fig .",
    "2 we show the upper limit on @xmath31 as a function of @xmath164 in the general ( m+1)ssm as a thin straight line . for @xmath165 ( corresponding to @xmath166 )",
    "we obtain the announced result : the upper limit on a higgs boson with @xmath167 is always given by the previous upper limit on @xmath15 , even if the corresponding higgs boson is actually the second lightest one . the same applies , of course , to the c(m+1)ssm where the upper limit on @xmath31 is also indicated as crosses in fig .  2",
    "in the following we will discuss this delicate regime , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , in some detail :    fortunately , one finds that the upper limit on @xmath31 is saturated only when the mass @xmath15 of the lightest higgs boson tends to 0 . clearly , one has to take into account the constraints from higgs boson searches which apply to reduced couplings @xmath3  i.e. lower limits on @xmath15 as a function of @xmath168  in order to obtain realistic upper limits on @xmath31 vs @xmath164 .",
    "lower limits on @xmath15 as a function of @xmath169 ( in the regime @xmath162 ) have been obtained at lep @xcite .",
    "we use the following analytic approximation for the constraints on @xmath169 vs @xmath15 in this regime :    _ 10 r_1 < - 2 [ lep ]    the resulting upper limit on @xmath31 is shown in fig .  2 as a thick straight line .",
    "this constraint is automatically included in the c(m+1)ssm results ( crosses ) .",
    "present and future higgs searches at lep will lead to more stringent constraints in the regime @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "we approximate the possible constraints from a run at 198  gev c.m .",
    "energy and 200  pb@xmath171 by    r_1 < 2 ( ) ^4 - 3 [ lep2 ]    the resulting upper limit on @xmath31 is shown in fig .  2 as a thick dashed line .",
    "it would be desirable to have the upper limit on @xmath31 in the general ( m+1)ssm for arbitrary lower limits on @xmath15 as a function of @xmath169 .",
    "to this end we have produced fig .",
    "the different dotted curves show the upper limit on @xmath31 as a function of @xmath164 for different lower limits on @xmath15 ( as indicated on each curve ) as a function of @xmath169 ( as indicated at the top of fig .  3 ) .",
    "in practice , fig .",
    "3 can be used to obtain upper limits on the mass @xmath31 , in the regime @xmath162 , for arbitrary experimental lower limits on the mass @xmath15 : for each value of the coupling @xmath169 , which corresponds to a vertical line in fig .  3 , one has to find the point where this vertical line crosses the dotted curve associated to the corresponding experimental lower limit on @xmath15 .",
    "joining these points by a curve leads to the upper limit on @xmath31 as a function of @xmath164 .",
    "we have indicated again the present lep limit ( [ lep ] ) , already shown in fig .  2 , which excludes the shaded region ( @xmath172  gev for @xmath173 , @xmath174  gev for @xmath175 , _ etc _ ) .",
    "we have also shown again the possible lep2 constraints on @xmath31 arising from ( [ lep2 ] ) as a thick dashed line .    lower experimental limits on a higgs boson with @xmath2",
    "restrict the allowed regime for @xmath31 ( for @xmath176 ) in fig .  3 from below .",
    "the present lower limits on @xmath31 from lep are not visible in fig .  3 , since we have only shown the range @xmath177  gev .",
    "possibly higgs searches at the run ii of the tevatron push the lower limits on @xmath31 upwards into this range .",
    "this would be necessary if one aims at an exclusion of the delicate regime of the ( m+1)ssm : then , lower limits on the mass @xmath31  for any value of @xmath164 between @xmath178 and 1  of at least 133.5  gev are required ; the precise experimental lower limits on @xmath31 as a function of @xmath164 , which would be needed to this end , will depend on the achieved lower limits on @xmath15 as a function of @xmath169 in the regime @xmath162 .    in principle",
    ", from eq .",
    "( [ rsum ] ) , one could have @xmath179 with @xmath164 as small as @xmath180 .",
    "however , in the regime @xmath181 , the upper bound on @xmath31 as a function of @xmath164 for different fixed values of @xmath15 can only be saturated if @xmath182 .",
    "then it is sufficient to look for a higgs boson with a coupling @xmath183 and a mass @xmath184  gev to cover this region of the parameter space of the ( m+1)ssm .",
    "finally , we consider the dependence of the upper bounds on @xmath33 on @xmath83 and the top quark pole mass . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the upper limit on @xmath33 ( for @xmath185 ) against @xmath83 for @xmath186  gev as a thick straight line . remarkably , as announced before , this @xmath83 dependence is very different from the mssm : the maximum is assumed for @xmath187 ( with @xmath188  gev in agreement with figs .",
    "the origin of this @xmath83 dependence is the tree level contribution @xmath189 to ( 3.11 ) .",
    "the height and the location of the maximum varies somewhat with @xmath122 ; the thick dashed and dotted curves correspond to @xmath32  gev , respectively .",
    "the absolute maximum is at @xmath190 with @xmath191  gev .    in the delicate regime , where one has to search for the second lightest higgs with @xmath164 between @xmath178 and @xmath192",
    ", one could worry whether the @xmath83 dependence of the upper limit on @xmath193 is different .",
    "this is not the case : as a thin straight line we show the upper limit on @xmath31 in the extreme case @xmath194 and @xmath129  gev ( where the lep constraint ( [ lep ] ) is taken into account ) , which assumes again its maximum for @xmath195 ( now with @xmath196  gev in agreement with figs .",
    "2,3 ) . as above",
    ", the thin dashed and dotted curves correspond to @xmath197  gev , respectively , and the absolute maximum is at @xmath190 with @xmath198  gev . within the c(m+1)ssm , where @xmath23 is small , the dependence of the upper limit on @xmath31 on @xmath83 ressembles more to the one of the mssm as shown as crosses in fig .  4 .    to conclude",
    ", we have studied the cp even higgs sector of the general ( m+1)ssm and the c(m+1)ssm including the dominant two loop corrections to the effective potential .",
    "we have emphasized the need to search for higgs bosons with reduced couplings , which are possible within this model .",
    "our main results are presented in fig .",
    "3 , which allows to obtain the constraints on the higgs sector of the model both from searches for higgs bosons with weak coupling ( @xmath3 ) , and strong coupling ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for testing the complete parameter space of the ( m+1)ssm is to rule out a cp even higgs boson with a coupling @xmath199 and a mass below 135  gev .",
    "the sufficient condition ( i.e. the precise upper bound on @xmath31 vs @xmath164 ) depends on the achieved lower bound on the mass of a weakly coupled higgs ( with @xmath200 ) and can be obtained from fig .",
    "3 . at the tevatron",
    "this would probably require an integrated luminosity of up to 30 fb@xmath171 @xcite .",
    "if this can not be achieved , and no higgs is discovered , we will have to wait for the results of the lhc in order to see whether supersymmetry beyond the mssm is realized in nature .",
