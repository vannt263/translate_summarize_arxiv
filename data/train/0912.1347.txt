    "monitoring known radial velocity planets at predicted transit times presents an avenue through which to explore the mass - radius relationship of exoplanets into regions of period / periastron space beyond that which is currently encompassed @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for those planets in relatively eccentric orbits @xcite , as demonstrated by the the variation in transit probability with the argument of periastron ( see figure 1 , left panel ) . here",
    "we describe techniques for refining ephemerides and performing follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "these methods are being employed by the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) .",
    "the transit window as described here is defined as a specific time period during which a complete transit ( including ingress and egress ) could occur for a specified planet .",
    "the size of a transit window depends upon the uncertainties in the fit parameters .",
    "they also deteriorate over time , motivating follow - up of the transit window as soon as possible after discovery .",
    "figure 1 ( right panel ) shows the size of the first transit window ( after the fit time of periastron passage , @xmath0 ) for a sample of 245 exoplanets .",
    "the transit windows of the short - period planets tend to be significantly smaller than those of long - period planets since , at the time of discovery , many more orbits have been monitored to provide a robust estimate of the orbital period .",
    "targets chosen for terms tend to be those which have small transit windows , medium - long periods , and a relatively high probability of transiting the host star .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "a considerable number of high transit probability targets are difficult to adequately monitor during their transit windows because the uncertainties in the predicted transit mid - points are too high ( months or even years ) .",
    "the acquisition of just a handful of new radial velocity measurements at carefully optimised times can reduce the size of a transit window by an order of magnitude .",
    "this is described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "due to the wide range of stars monitored , both in sky location and brightness , terms collaborates with a variety of existing groups to take advantage of transit window opportunities .",
    "note that the observations from this survey will lead to improved exoplanet orbital parameters and ephemerides even without an eventual transit detection for a particular planet .",
    "the results from this survey will provide a complementary dataset to the fainter magnitude range of the _ kepler _ mission , which is expected to discover many transiting planets including those of intermediate to long - period .",
