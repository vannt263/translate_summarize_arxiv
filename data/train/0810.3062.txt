    "since the pioneering papers by bender and coworkers@xcite,@xcite , the study of non - hermitian hamiltonians invariant under space - time reflection has developed into a branch of quantum mechanics in its own , called @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "the large majority of analyses have been devoted to bound state problems , where the observation that @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians with eigenfunctions that are eigenstates of @xmath0  have real spectra has led to hermitian - equivalent formulations , where one can define a linear operator @xmath1 , commuting with hamiltonian @xmath2 and with @xmath0 , that permits constructing time - independent inner products with positive - definite norms of the form @xmath3 ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "@xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics has a close connection with the more general quasi - hermitian quantum mechanics@xcite,@xcite , mo08 , where @xmath2 is called quasi - hermitian if it satisfies the intertwining relation @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a positive - definite hermitian operator called the metric operator , playing a role analogous to @xmath6 .",
    "while bound states of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians are nowadays well understood , many more questions remain open in the treatment of scattering states : for instance , it has been shown in ref.@xcite that even simple local potentials require introducing non - local metric operators and non - standard boundary conditions with progressive and regressive waves not only in the initial but also in the final state .",
    "even if the latter feature might be removed by an appropriate choice of the metric operator , called quasi - local in refs.@xcite,@xcite , a satisfactory general approach has not been formulated yet .",
    "this is why the majority of studies on scattering by @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians has been made within the framework of standard quantum mechanics , breaking unitarity of the corresponding scattering matrices ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even at this effective level , @xmath0-symmetric potentials are peculiar , in the sense that , depending on their parameters , they may behave as absorptive for progressive waves and generative for regressive ones ( or viceversa ) , a property called handedness in ref.@xcite , or it may happen that they are neither absorptive , nor generative , because the sum of the square moduli of transmission and reflection coefficients may be smaller than one , or greater than one in different intervals of incident energy ; they can even conserve unitarity when the asymptotic wave functions are eigenstates of @xmath0 : in this latter case they are necessarily reflectionless@xcite .",
    "as is known , the reflection of progressive ( left - to - right ) and regressive ( right - to - left ) waves is quite asymmetric ( @xmath7 ) already in the case of local potentials , where the transmission is the same ; in the case of non - local potentials@xcite , the transmission is asymmetric , too ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "indeed , non - local potentials have more subtle @xmath9-transformation properties than local potentials , for which @xmath10- invariance and hermiticity requirements coincide@xcite .",
    "the scenario is even richer in relativistic quantum mechanics , where , again , the majority of studies have been dedicated to bound states of @xmath0-symmetric potentials in the klein - gordon and dirac equations in ( 1 + 1 ) space - time dimensions . limiting ourselves to the dirac equation , of interest to the present work , we may quote the pseudo - supersymmetric descriptionsr05,@xcite of scalar or pseudo - scalar local potentials with exact , or spontaneously broken @xmath0  symmetry , the @xmath0-symmetric version of the generalized hulthn vector potential@xcite , the combinations of scalar ( position - dependent mass ) and vector potentials of refs.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    making again an effective approach to scattering aspects ,",
    "we have examined in a recent work@xcite the dirac equation with the time component of a vector potential in the form of a @xmath0-symmetric square well : when the real depth exceeds @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the particle mass , transmission resonances at negative energies appear as the signature of spontaneous pair production , but become weaker with increasing imaginary depth and negligible beyond the critical value at which real bound states disappear .    in the present work , which extends the non - relativistic results of refs.@xcite,@xcite , we consider a scalar and vector combination of non - local separable potentials in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional dirac equation , aimed in particular at the study of symmetries known in their three - dimensional form as the spin and pseudo - spin symmetries , the latter being experimentally observed in atomic nuclei .",
    "numerical results will be consistently obtained from the @xmath0-symmetric version of a solvable potential originally proposed by yamaguchi for the description of bound and scattering states of the neutron - proton system .    since this kind of potential has received until now moderate attention within the framework of @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics , and , to our knowledge , no attention at all in its relativistic version , we consider it worthwhile to perform a detailed , albeit effective analysis by means of the green function method described in section 2 . the scattering matrix is then studied in section 3 and two non - relativistic limits for the particular choices of the ratio of vector and scalar couplings  corresponding to spin and pseudo - spin symmetry",
    "are discussed in section 4 .",
    "bound states are studied in section 5 and numerical results obtained with a kernel corresponding to the yamaguchi potential are discussed in section 6 .",
    "section 7 is dedicated to conclusions and perspectives of future work .",
