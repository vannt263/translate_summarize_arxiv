    "one - loop radiative corrections to the 4d gauge couplings induced by compact dimensions were extensively studied in the past . in general in a 4d renormalisable model such as the standard model ( sm ) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the one - loop `` running '' of the gauge couplings is logarithmic . if these models are considered as low energy limits of higher dimensional models , additional corrections to this `` running '' exist .",
    "these are associated with compact dimensions and induced by the corresponding kaluza - klein ( kk ) states which are charged under the gauge group of the model .",
    "such corrections were analysed in effective field theory ( see for example @xcite ) and in string theory models  @xcite .    in an effective field theory model with one or two additional compact dimensions one can compute the one - loop correction to the 4d gauge coupling by summing up individual contributions of the kaluza - klein states in the loop ( figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the correction is usually evaluated on - shell @xmath5 and this is particularly true for the string calculations , which in a more general setup also include the additional effect of the winding modes ( if present ) .",
    "the coupling corrected by this one - loop threshold correction depends on the uv regulator / cutoff which provides an indication of the uv behaviour of the theory .",
    "effective field theory calculations of the one - loop correction @xmath6 ) @xcite show remarkable quantitative agreement with heterotic string results at `` large '' compactification radii .",
    "see however @xcite for a further discussion on the link between these approaches .",
    "the 4d gauge coupling obtained as above ( hereafter denoted @xmath7 ) is usually regarded as the coupling at some `` high '' ( compactification ) scale @xcite . below the compactification scale",
    "it is usually assumed that a 4d theory and corresponding logarithmic `` running '' ( in @xmath8 ) apply .",
    "this is indeed the case under the assumption that the massive kaluza - klein states decouple at a momentum scale @xmath0 above or of the order of the compactification scale(s ) . in general such decoupling",
    "is true for a finite number of states .",
    "however , in the case of evaluating the contribution of many _",
    "infinite_-level towers of kaluza - klein states such situation may turn out to be slightly different . to illustrate this we use an effective field model to analyse the more general case of @xmath9 for the one - loop correction ( figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "this will reveal a new effect , present when summing over infinite towers of kk modes .",
    "in such case it turns out that higher dimensional operators are radiatively generated as _",

    "this is a result of a ( one - loop ) `` mixing '' of the two contributions associated each with one compact dimension .",

    "we discuss in detail the link of such higher dimension operators in our field theory approach with one - loop heterotic string calculations and their ( dis)agreement .",
    "special attention is paid below to the regularisation of the divergent series of integrals involved , performed in a gauge invariant way .    to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the general structure of the one - loop correction in two simple 4d toy - models which have one and two additional compact dimensions , respectively .",
    "we assume each model has a gauge group @xmath10 with 4d tree level gauge coupling @xmath11 , and that they are compactified on a one- and two - dimensional orbifolds respectively . for our discussion the exact details of compactification are somewhat unimportant and one can work in the setup presented in @xcite .",
    "4d n=1 supersymmetry is a necessary ingredient to ensure only wavefunction - induced corrections to the 4d gauge coupling . to illustrate the main point one can use the qed action in 5d and 6d respectively , to perform a one - loop calculation of the vacuum polarisation diagram in fig .",

    "again , if one had @xmath125 in the ( ir finite ) massive modes sector , this term would have been missed too .    following the one compact dimension example , one could in principle write from eqs.([prtgfbm ] ) , ( [ ttt6 ] ) @xmath126\\ ] ] eq.([wrtrtwndmb ] ) shows that the pole @xmath51 present in both @xmath4 and @xmath38 cancels out in their difference , similar to the case of one compact dimension .",

    "even if @xmath131 and @xmath132 , since @xmath98 , one can not set this term to 0 , and a `` non - decoupling '' effect of the kk modes is manifest",
    ". therefore the limit of scales @xmath0 well below the compactification scales ( hereafter referred to as `` infrared '' ) and the uv regularisation limit @xmath98 do not commute . as a result a uv - ir `` mixing '' effect ( ir - finite , uv - divergent ) exists due to the first term in present in @xmath4 or @xmath38 but not in their difference is itself a similar uv - ir contribution @xcite . ]",

    "one concludes that in this regularisation set - up the kaluza - klein non - zero modes give an effect even at momentum scales well below the compactification scale , where one would expect them to be decoupled .",
    "the presence of the uv - ir mixing term is a result of considering the effect of an infinite ( rather than a `` truncated '' ) tower of kaluza - klein modes , and as a consequence such `` non - decoupling '' effect , induced by infinitely many modes , may not be unexpected in the end .",
    "it is then puzzling why the term @xmath122 has no counterpart in the one compact dimension case , where we also summed over the whole kk tower .",
    "how can we explain this difference ?",
    "as we discuss later , such term corresponds to a counterterm in the action @xmath133 which can not be generated in 5d at one - loop @xcite due to lorentz invariance . at the technical level",
    "one can show that @xmath134 emerges as a one - loop `` mixing '' of the effects of two compact dimensions : it arises as a mixed contribution between a sum over `` original '' kaluza - klein modes associated with one compact dimension and a `` poisson re - summed '' ( or winding ) zero - mode here @xmath46 labels original kk modes while @xmath135 denotes their `` poisson re - summed '' or dual ( winding ) modes referred to in the text .",
    "] of a sum corresponding to the second compact dimension .",
    "it is then clear why such term can not appear in the case of a single compact dimension .",
    "this shows explicitly a different behaviour of the radiative corrections with respect to the character even / odd of the number of compact dimensions @xcite and brings additional effects to those discussed in previous works  @xcite .",
    "an immediate question is the regularisation dependence of the existence of the term @xmath122 .",
    "our comparative analysis shows that the effect exists for two compact dimensions but there is no counterpart for one compact dimension where the same uv regularisation was used .",
    "this gives some indication that the existence of the term @xmath122 is not the result of a particular uv regularisation choice .",
    "further , our previous discussion on the ir regularisation does not affect the existence of this term , and finally , the dr scheme used is supposed to provide a uv well - defined and manifestly gauge invariant framework  @xcite .",
    "one may argue that the uv regularisation must not affect the ir regime of the theory and that the dr scheme used in this calculation might not respect this condition .",
    "however , calculations closely related @xcite using an uv regularisation with a proper - time cutoff ( @xmath136 ) in eqs.([lprt ] ) , ( [ wr1 ] ) instead of dr , yield a similar uv - ir `` mixing '' term ) with uv cutoff regularisation instead of dr has @xmath137 replaced by a term proportional to @xmath138 @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath139 , with the @xmath51 factor simply replaced by the logarithm of the uv cutoff @xmath140 .",
    "eqs.([ttt6 ] ) , ( [ wrtrtwndmb ] ) simply tell us that higher dimension ( derivative ) operators need to be included for a fully consistent one - loop calculation .",
    "this is a significant difference from the previous case of one compact dimension only .",
    "indeed , the presence of the term @xmath63 in the effective field theory result shows that for two compact dimensions the dr regularisation with minimal subtraction is not sufficient and that higher dimensional operators are radiatively generated / required as _ one - loop counterterms_. one such counterterm is @xmath133 ( for related discussions on this issue see section iv b in  @xcite ) .",

    "we do not address in the following the detailed implications for field theory of such higher dimensional operators , but discuss instead the origin of @xmath128 or equivalently @xmath139 in @xmath4 , from a _",

    "the predicted value of the string scale @xmath152 does _ not _ include the effects from such operators .",
    "this finding should be considered when attempting solutions for an _ exact _ matching of the mssm unification scale with the heterotic string scale .",
    "for one and two dimensional orbifold compactification we considered the general case of evaluating at one loop level @xmath4 in a manifestly gauge invariant scheme ( dr ) . for these models we discussed comparatively the dependence of the couplings on the momentum scale @xmath8 and @xmath163 , and the role of higher dimensional operators as one - loop counterterms .",
    "these can be generated when the summation over the _",
    "infinite _ towers of kaluza - klein modes is performed .",
    "the analysis showed a different behaviour of the one - loop correction with respect to the character even / odd of the number of compact dimensions , with such operators generated for the case of two but not for one compact dimension(s ) .",
    "for one compact dimension the change of the couplings @xmath164 with respect to the momentum scale is uv regulator independent at _ one - loop _ level , unlike the case of more common approaches using cutoff regularisation @xcite . for one compact dimension the results can be used for phenomenology , unification of the gauge couplings and searches for effects from compact dimensions .    for two compact dimensions",
    "a similar analysis of the one - loop effects suggests the existence of a correction which couples low ( `` infrared '' ) scales below the compactification scales , to uv divergent terms .",
    "this implies the existence in this toy - model of some `` non - decoupling '' effects at low energies , due to a `` mixing '' of the two _ infinite _ towers of kaluza - klein states",
    ". the emergence of such non - decoupling term in the effective field theory can be re - interpreted and explained simply by the presence - for two compact dimensions - of higher dimensional operators which are required as _ one - loop counterterms_.    we investigated in detail the origin of such operators from the heterotic string perspective .",
    "the origin of these counterterms can be related to string corrections to @xmath38 of type @xmath165 ( with @xmath1 the ir string regulator ) which are usually discarded in the final one - loop string result , since @xmath3 .",
    "however , they become relevant in the field theory limit , and also in pure field theory calculations where the two regularisation limits ( in ir , uv ) do not commute .",
    "this raises some intriguing issues about the _ infrared _ problem in heterotic string and its link with higher dimensional one - loop counterterms in field theory .",
    "if the kaluza - klein towers are `` truncated '' to a finite number of modes , such operators are not generated . in such case the discrete `` shift '' symmetry of summing over an infinite tower of kaluza - klein modes is broken . under our initial assumption",
    "that such symmetry holds , the higher dimensional operators can be seen to account for non - perturbative effects .",
    "this is because such operators are ultimately related to effects of a zero-mode  of a `` poisson re - summed '' kaluza - klein series , i.e. a winding mode ( non - perturbative ) effect .",
    "it is possible that in fully specified models symmetry arguments may be identified to avoid the presence of such higher dimension operators .",
    "nevertheless we think these findings are important for phenomenology , in particular for the scale of unification of gauge couplings .",
    "we argued that one - loop effects from higher dimension counterterms are not included in the ( predicted ) value of the string scale and this has implications for its mismatch with the mssm unification scale .",
