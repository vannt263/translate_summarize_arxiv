    "a supersolid is a special type of solid with superfluid properties .",

    "the simplest model for supersolid was proposed by andreev and lifshitz in 1969.@xcite their model was introduced to describe possible supersolid phase in helium-4 . in their model , vacancies or interstitials of solid helium may exist in the ground state and condense due to the large quantum fluctuation of helium atoms .",
    "the interaction between vacancy and interstital is neglected in their model .    in this paper",
    "we study a two - species boson hubbard model , which is an extension of the andreev - lifshitz model to include the interaction between vacancy and interstitial .",
    "this two - species model was recently introduced by dai , ma , and zhang,@xcite motivated by the observation of non - classical rotational inertia moment in solid helium-4 reported by kim and chan.@xcite they used a mean field theory to study the ground state of the model and the possibility of the supersolid phase .",
    "it was shown that the interaction of vacancies and interstitials may facilitate a supersolid phase . in this paper",
    "we use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations to study the possible supersolid and the finite temperature phase transition in the two - species boson model .",
    "the simulations support the qualitative conclusion obtained in the mean field theory that the vacancy - interstitial interaction may facilitate supersolidity . using qmc",
    ", we calculate the phase diagram , the superfluid densities of bosons , and the specific heat of the system .",
    "the two - species boson model and our calculations may be useful to understand other boson problems such as bosons in optical lattices.@xcite    before we present the model and our results , we briefly summarize the current situation in study of supersolid helium-4 . because of its light mass and its bosonic nature , solid helium-4 has been a natural candidate for possible supersolid at low temperatures and high pressures .",
    "theoretically , such a possibility was proposed by andreev and lifshitz@xcite and by chester .",
    "@xcite leggett further predicted the non - classical rotational inertia moment of such a supersolid in a rotating experiment.@xcite the interest of supersolid has been recently revived due to the observation of non - classical rotational inertia in solid helium-4.@xcite by now , the non - classical inertia moment in solid helium has been confirmed by other groups.@xcite however , it remains controversial if the phenomenon is related to the supersolidity and if the supersolid phase is a bulk equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "@xcite on the theoretical side qmc simulations did not find a supersolid phase in helium-4.@xcite furthermore , the vacancies or interstitials in helium are shown to attract to each other and to tend to have phase - separation,@xcite indicating that the andreev - lifshitz model may not describe solid helium .",

    "@xmath18 is the on - site attractive interaction between a vacancy and an interstitial .",
    "note that the attractive interaction between a vacancy and an interstitial reflects the strong short range repulsion between two nearby atoms when an interstitial atom is added into the lattice .    without interaction , at @xmath19 , the two - species model decouples into independent vacancy and interstitial models .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath3-boson ( vacancy ) model is superfluid ( a vacancy supersolid ) if @xmath20 and an empty vacuum state ( insulating solid ) otherwise .",
    "similarly , the ground state of the @xmath8-boson ( interstitial ) model is superfluid ( an interstitial supersolid ) if @xmath21 and the empty vacuum state ( an insulating solid ) otherwise .",
    "the attractive inter - species boson interaction @xmath18 couples the two types of boson , and the problem can not be solved analytically without approximation .",
    "this model was studied by using a mean field theory at zero temperature,@xcite and a special limiting case with @xmath22 but a finite @xmath23 was investigated by a modified spin wave theory.@xcite the main effect of the attractive term is to facilitate vacancy or / and interstital condensation due to excitons or bound states .    in this paper",
    "we will use qmc methods to study the phase transition and superfluid properties of the model .",
    "we use a slightly extended version of the directed loop algorithms@xcite of the alps project.@xcite in the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) representation used by this algorithm the superfulid density can be measured through the fluctuations of the spatial winding numbers.@xcite in three dimensions for a simple cubic lattice the relationship is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 refers to the type of boson , @xmath26 is the spatial winding number of the bosons in one direction , @xmath27 is the linear size of the cubic lattice and @xmath28 the temperature .",
