    "as a recent development , the possibility of unambiguous discrimination between unknown quantum states can be potentially useful for many application in quantum communication and quantum computing .",
    "a universal device that can unambiguously discriminate between two unknown states has been constructed by bergou and hillery @xcite .",
    "it has three registers , labeled a , b and c , and each register can store a qubit that is in some arbitrary state . in their work",
    ", it is assumed that register a is prepared in the state @xmath2 , register c is prepared in the states @xmath3 , and register b is guaranteed to be prepared in either @xmath2 or @xmath3 . here ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the states to be distinguished , which are both unknown @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary unknown complex variables satisfying the normalization equation @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that register b is prepared in the state @xmath2 with probability @xmath10 and in the state @xmath3 with probability @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 , which guarantees that the state in register b is always one of these two states .",
    "the states viewed as a program which are sent into registers a and c ( called program registers ) are called program states , while the unknown state to be conformed which is sent into the register b ( called data register ) is called data state .",
    "the device constructed here can measure the total input states latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    & = & |\\psi_1\\rangle_a|\\psi_1\\rangle_b|\\psi_2\\rangle_c,\\nonumber\\\\    which are prepared with apriori probabilities @xmath10 and @xmath11 . with the symmetry properties of the input states , this device will then , with some probabilities of success , tell us whether the unknown state in the data register b matches the state stored in program register a or c.    in later works , a series of new devices have been introduced and widely discussed by other authors @xcite . in these schemes",
    "we may have @xmath14 and @xmath15 copies of the states in the program register a and c respectively , and @xmath16 copies of the states in the data register b , then our task is to distinguish the two states @xmath17 with the minimum error or with the minimum inconclusive probability , if the minimum error strategy or optimum unambiguous strategy is applied , respectively @xcite .    in both previous papers @xcite and @xcite , it has been proved that the optimal success probability of discrimination between two unknown qubits is an increasing function of @xmath16 , the number of copies in data register b. in this paper , we study the qudit states in n - dimensional hilbert space and demonstrate that the optimal success probability of discrimination between two unknown states is independent of the dimension @xmath0 .",
    "unlike the discrimination between two known states , we can not consider the subspace spanned by the two states only , but we should consider the full @xmath0-dimensional space , as the two states are completely unknown to us .",
    "we adopt the equivalence between the discrimination of unknown pure states and that of known mixed states , and then reduce the problem to the unambiguous discrimination between two pure states with jordan - basis method .",
    "finally , we get the optimal success probability of the unambiguous discrimination between the two mixed states and give the detection operators .",
    "the detection operators are also applicable to the discrimination between the pure states without averaging over them .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we give a brief description of the programmable states discrimination , and adopt the equivalence between the discrimination of unknown states to that of known mixed states . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we introduced the jordan basis for the mean input states . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we find the optimal unambiguous discrimination and introduce its implementation . finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "in previous works , states such as @xmath18 have been considered @xcite .",
    "these states lie in a two - dimensional hilbert space . here",
    "we introduce a more generalized state @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary unknown complex variable .",
    "all these states span a n - dimensional hilbert space @xmath21 , for which @xmath22 form a mutually orthogonal basis .",
    "the two states we want to distinguish are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as we mentioned before , a copy of each of the two unknown states is provided for the program registers a and c , denoted as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the state to be conformed is provided for the data register b as input .",
    "we assume that the state in the data register b is guaranteed to be prepared in @xmath2 with probability @xmath10 and in @xmath3 with probability @xmath25 respectively .",
    "thus we have two possible inputs latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    & = & |\\psi_1\\rangle_a|\\psi_1\\rangle_b|\\psi_2\\rangle_c,\\nonumber\\\\    here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are completely arbitrary states @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unknown , and the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 making up these two inputs can change from preparation to preparation , it is only the pattern , middle states ( b ) matching the first ( a ) or the last ( c ) state that is preserved from one preparation to the next .",
    "therefore , we can introduce the corresponding density operators @xmath29 where the average is taken over the entire parameter space of states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "here , we should notice that the optimal strategy for discrimination between the two states is the strategy that is optimal on average .",
    "that s to say , we can unambiguously discriminate between @xmath2 and @xmath3 as soon as we can unambiguously discriminate between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    to this end",
    ", we now define the space and operators that we will need .",
    "let @xmath21 be the n - dimensional space for the unknown states and then the full space is @xmath32 .",
    "the space of symmetric states in @xmath33 is denoted by @xmath34 , which is an @xmath35-dimensional subspace .",
    "@xmath36 is an element of @xmath37 and @xmath28 is an element of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 , the intersection of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , is the space of symmetric states in the full space @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath42 is a subspace of dimension @xmath43 , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 both @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the subspace of @xmath32 generated by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the dimension of @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the orthogonal complement of @xmath42 in @xmath40 , let @xmath48 be the orthogonal complement of @xmath42 in @xmath41 , and let @xmath49 be the orthogonal complement of @xmath42 in @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , the average in @xmath30 uniformly fills the symmetric subspace of a and b and the entire subspace of c , whereas the average in @xmath31 uniformly fills the symmetric subspace of b and c and the entire subspace of a. therefore , the corresponding density operators averaged over the unknown states , can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the projection onto @xmath34 , and @xmath52 onto @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath51 can be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the unique unit vectors in the symmetric subspace @xmath34 , @xmath55$]-dimensional spaces @xmath40 and @xmath41 in @xmath45 , which is equivalent to discriminating between subspaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the @xmath56$]-dimensional space @xmath49 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that two nonorthogonal subspaces @xmath57 and @xmath58 of a hilbert space can be unambiguously discriminated if we can find their canonical or jordan bases @xcite .",
    "the definition of the jordan bases is as follows .",
    "the set of orthogonal and normalized basis vectors @xmath59 in @xmath57 and @xmath60 in @xmath58 form jordan bases if and only if @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the jordan angles @xmath63 . in the jordan form , the full hilbert space is decomposed into @xmath0 orthogonal subspaces . here",
    ", we denote the @xmath64th subspace spanned by @xmath65 and @xmath66 by @xmath67 .",
    "clearly , if the dimension of @xmath67 is 1 , we can get @xmath68 , and no further discrimination is possible in @xmath67 . on the other hand , if @xmath69 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are linearly independent , and they can be distinguished as two known pure states , which is familiar to us .",
    "thus our task is reduced to some separate discriminations in each subspace , between two known pure states .",
    "now , we will choose some bases to construct jordan bases for the density operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "first , we should notice that the fully symmetric subspace of the three states @xmath42 must be common to both inputs .",
    "here , we denote the basis for the subspace @xmath42 by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is satisfied , and there are @xmath43 these unique unit vectors , which can be expressed as follows ,    @xmath72    then , the structure of the two density operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , in particular the decomposition on the right - hand side , suggests that we consider @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these vectors form orthogonal bases for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "thus the unique unit vector @xmath70 in @xmath42 can be expressed in terms of either @xmath40 or @xmath41 , since it is in both spaces . here",
    ", we neglect the vectors @xmath70 that satisfy @xmath77 , and a direct calculation shows that    @xmath78    and @xmath79    we can now introduce the vectors @xmath80 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 for @xmath83 ,    @xmath84    and @xmath85    for @xmath86 . it is easy to see that @xmath87 s form orthogonal bases for subspace @xmath47 , while @xmath88 s form orthogonal bases for subspace @xmath48 . and there are @xmath89 @xmath87 s and @xmath89 @xmath88 s .",
    "thus we can rearrange the footnotes , and get @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath64 can change from @xmath90 to @xmath89 . from the explicit expressions of @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", we can easily get @xmath91 and @xmath92 and @xmath93 form jordan bases for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the two density operators that we want to distinguish can now be expressed as @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 is the projection onto the subspace @xmath42 , and @xmath97    now , let @xmath67 be the two - dimensional space spanned by the nonorthogonal but linearly independent vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 . the @xmath67 form a decomposition of subspace @xmath49 into @xmath98 mutually perpendicular two - dimensional subspaces .",
    "our next problem is how to distinguish the two pure sates in every subspace @xmath67 .",
    "we now want to unambiguously discriminate between the subspaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath49 .",
    "first , we distinguish the jordan basis states @xmath65 and @xmath66 within their subspace @xmath67 . in subspace",
    "@xmath67 , the apriori probabilities of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . here",
    "we will use the method mentioned in @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath99 and @xmath100 the reciprocal states of @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively , where @xmath101 and then @xmath102 thus , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be rewritten as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq2 }    2}|g_i^\\bot\\rangle- \\frac{\\displaystyle 1}{\\displaystyle 2}|h_i\\rangle,\\nonumber\\\\     we can give a physical implementation based on neumark s theorem @xcite .",
    "following the proposals given in @xcite : ( a ) any pure state can be realized by a single - photon state and ( b ) following reck s theorem @xcite , any unitary transformation can also be realized by an optical network consisting of beam - splitters , phase - shifter , etc .",
    "@xcite , we can construct an optical device , which is presented in fig .",
    "1a , to unambiguously discriminate between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "an additional port is initially prepared in the vaccum state @xmath104 .",
    "the operation of such a device is described by a unitary matrix @xmath105 which gives the probability amplitudes for a single photon entering via inputs @xmath99 and @xmath66 to leave the device by outputs @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . here , the four - port optical interferometer , which is presented in fig .",
    "1b , is used and it is capable of realizing any @xmath109 unitary transformation @xmath110 @xmath111 where we have tacitly assumed that the action of all the @xmath109 beam splitter upon the states of the photon is described by a unitary matrix of real coefficient @xmath112 the parameter @xmath113 describes the transmittance ( @xmath114 ) and the reflectivity ( @xmath115 ) of the beam splitter . as shown in fig .",
    "1a , the action of this device , denoted by @xmath105 gives , @xmath116 from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath105 will transform @xmath65 and @xmath66 into @xmath117    as shown in fig .",
    "1a , both @xmath65 and @xmath66 have their own detectors @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and these two detectors will tell us which the input is , while @xmath120 corresponds to failure .",
    "this suggests that no photon can be detected by detector @xmath119 @xmath121 when the input is @xmath65 @xmath122 .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) we get @xmath123 eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) are reduced to @xmath124    in other words , we can choose @xmath125 with @xmath126 to be our detection operators . here",
    ", also from fig .",
    "1a , we can get @xmath127 where eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) has been used .    by projecting these detection operators back onto the space @xmath67",
    ", we can get @xmath128 which form the povm detection operators for the unambiguous discrimination between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "so we find @xmath129 and the probability of successfully identifying the two states is @xmath130 by letting @xmath131 , @xmath132 can be rewritten as @xmath133 this function , @xmath134 , has the property that @xmath135 happens at @xmath136 the optimal value of @xmath134 denoted by @xmath137 in the domain @xmath138 , can be gotten in following three cases : + ( a ) if @xmath139 , the requirement @xmath138 is satisfied , thus we have @xmath140 ( b ) if @xmath141 , we should choose @xmath142 and ( c ) if @xmath143 , @xmath144 our finding can be summarized as follows @xmath145    now , the discrimination between the two density operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 is to achieve @xmath89 discriminations described above simultaneously .",
    "but , here the probability for the occurrence of the input state in @xmath67 is @xmath146 . we can also give its implementation in fig .",
    "2 . we leave @xmath147 alone , since they are in both subspaces @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and ca nt be distinguished .",
    "the povm which unambiguously distinguishes @xmath40 and @xmath41 has the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the probability of successfully identifying the two density operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 is @xmath150 then , the optimal success probability @xmath151 can be expressed as @xmath152    now , we come back to the original problem that discrimination between two pure states @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath28 ) . as mentioned before , the povm formed by @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 with @xmath156 can be used .",
    "its implementation is the same as discrimination between @xmath30 and @xmath31 in fig .",
    "the success probability is @xmath157 where the relationship @xmath158 has been used .",
    "finally , we can also get the optimal success probability as follows @xmath159 which is apparently independent of @xmath0 , the dimension of space @xmath21 , as we mentioned at the beginning .",
    "how to prepare the states with single photon is another important question in the optical realization of the discriminator",
    ". we shall give a brief discussion about this . an optical setting shown in fig .",
    "3 can prepare the state @xmath160 .",
    "it is constructed by a series of @xmath161 unitary transformations which can be realized by the four - port optical interferometer in fig .",
    "1b . if the parameters of each four - port interferometer are fixed properly , this setting achieves a single - photon state in n - dimensional space @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the operation of this device by @xmath162 , and @xmath163 then , by using @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 in succession , we can get @xmath167 where @xmath168 is either @xmath2 or @xmath3 and @xmath169 denote the only input for the device .",
    "and @xmath36 or @xmath28 is to be prepared depending on @xmath165 being @xmath164 or @xmath166 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have reconsidered the problem of the universal programmable quantum state discriminator originally introduced in @xcite . and we solved a more generalized problem that the unknown states are qudit states in the @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "we adopted the equivalence between the discrimination of unknown pure quantum states and that of known mixed states . with the jordan - basis method , we simplified the problem and finally achieved the optimal unambiguous discrimination between the two unknown states , and the corresponding detection operators have already been given .",
    "significantly , we arrived at an important conclusion that the optimal success probability of the discrimination between two unknown pure states is independent of @xmath0 , the dimension of the space @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , we also give the implementation of the optimal povm based on the neumark s theorem .",
    "the povm can be implemented on a larger hilbert space , where the additional degrees of freedom called ancilla are needed .",
