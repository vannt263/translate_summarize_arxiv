    "negative values are sometimes taken to be an indication of phase separation.@xcite    we want to argue that this condition is neither necessary nor sufficient : on the one hand , negative values only result from finite - size effects and should vanish in the thermodynamic limit leading to @xmath92 , as will be discussed below . on the other hand , we will show in fig .",
