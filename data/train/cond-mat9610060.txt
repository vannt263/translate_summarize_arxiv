    "investigation of the reaction fronts formed in the reaction - diffusion processes of the type a @xmath0 b @xmath1 0  with initially separated species a and b has attracted a lot of recent interest .",
    "this is due to the fact that not only the kinetics of such systems exhibits many surprising features @xcite , but they are also amenable to experimental studies @xcite .    a standard way to treat the initially separated problem analytically is to solve the partial differential equations @xcite @xmath8        {     \\frac{\\textstyle\\partial{{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}}}{\\textstyle\\partial t } } & = & { d_{\\mathrm{b } } } {     \\frac{\\textstyle\\partial^2{{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}}}{\\textstyle\\partial x^2 } } - r \\ , ,       \\end{array}\\ ] ] with the initial state given by @xmath9          { \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}(x , t=0 ) & = & b_0 h(x )   \\ , ,       \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mean local concentrations of a s and b s , @xmath5 is the macroscopic reaction rate , @xmath12 denotes the heavyside step function , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 are some constants related to the initial concentrations of species a and b and their diffusion coefficients , respectively .    equations ( [ gr ] ) present the macroscopic approach to the problem .",
    "however , it has not been established yet how to relate the macroscopic reaction rate @xmath5 to the microscopic picture of the initially separated reaction - diffusion systems below or at the critical dimension @xmath14 .",
    "dimensional @xcite and renormalisation group analyses @xcite lead to the conclusion that above @xmath15 one can adopt the mean - field approximation @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being a constant . for 2d systems",
    "one expects logarithmic corrections to the mean - field picture @xcite .",
    "one dimensional systems are usually studied by examining microscopic models in which , upon contact , the members of a pair a  b react with some probability @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the analytical form of @xmath19 was derived for @xmath20 @xcite , and for @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "there are , however , several techniques which enables one to derive a lot of useful information from ( [ gr ] ) even for @xmath23 , i.e. when the explicit form of @xmath5 remains unknown .",
    "they are concentrated on the asymptotic , long - time behaviour of the reaction - diffusion systems , and include the renormalisation group analysis @xcite , the scaling ansatz @xcite , the quasistationary approximation @xcite , and our approach of ref .  @xcite .    according to the scaling ansatz @xcite , the long - time behaviour of the reaction - diffusion system inside the reaction layer can be described with a help of some scaling functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 through @xmath27    \\label{sb }      { \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}(x , t ) & = & { \\eta_{\\mathrm{b}}}t^{-{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{b}}}}{s_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\!\\left ( x - { x_{\\mathrm{f}}}(t ) \\over w(t ) \\right)}\\,,\\\\[1ex ]    \\label{sr }        r(x , t ) & = & { \\eta_{\\mathrm{r}}}t^{-\\beta }   { s_{\\mathrm{r}}}{\\!\\left ( x - { x_{\\mathrm{f}}}(t ) \\over w(t ) \\right)}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes the point at which the reaction rate @xmath5 attains its maximal value , @xmath29 is the width of the reaction zone , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are some parameters independent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and exponents @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are some positive constants given , for @xmath39 and nonzero diffusion constants , by @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    the quasistationary approximation @xcite consists in the assumption that at sufficiently long times the kinetics of the front is governed by two characteristic time scales .",
    "one of them , @xmath43 , controls the rate of change in the diffusive current @xmath44 of particles arriving at the reaction layer .",
    "the other one , @xmath45 , is the equilibration time of the reaction front . if @xmath46 then @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath49 , in the vicinity of @xmath50 the left sides of ( [ gr ] ) become negligibly small compared to other terms .",
    "consequently , if @xmath2 and @xmath13 are both nonzero , the asymptotic form of @xmath51 and @xmath52 inside the reaction layer is governed by much simpler equations @xmath53         { d_{\\mathrm{b } } } {     \\frac{\\textstyle\\partial^2{{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}}}{\\textstyle\\partial x^2 } } & = & r \\ , ,       \\end{array}\\ ] ] which are to be solved with the boundary conditions @xmath54        \\partial{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}/\\partial x \\to { j_{\\mathrm{b}}}(t),\\;{\\rho_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\to 0      & \\;\\mbox{as}\\ ; &           x \\to + \\infty\\ , .      \\end{array}\\ ] ] the most important feature of the quasistationary equations ( [ stac ] ) is that they depend only on @xmath33 , with time @xmath34 being a parameter entering their solutions @xmath10 and @xmath11 only through the time dependent boundary currents @xmath55 whose dependence on @xmath34 , @xmath2 , @xmath13 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 has recently been derived analytically @xcite .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we employed the quasistatic approximation to develop a new method of investigating the asymptotic kinetics of the initially separated reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "a peculiar feature of that approach is that it is concentrated mainly on the properties of the system outside the reaction zone . in this way , without imposing any special restrictions on the form of @xmath5 , it relates _ exactly _ many quantities of physical interest to the values of external parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 , which will enable us to investigate the limit @xmath56 analytically . in particular it was shown that there exist two limits , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "however , when one of the components is immobile ( or ` static ' ) , the asymptotic kinetics of the reaction front can change dramatically .",
    "for example , in the mean - field approximation the width of the front converges to a stationary value , and the reaction rate at @xmath50 decreases as @xmath72 , which corresponds to @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we have therefore two asymptotic universality classes : one characteristic for the ` dynamic ' systems in which both components diffuse , and the ` quasistatic ' one observed if one of the diffusion constants is zero .",
    "henceforth we shall assume @xmath75 , so the two asymptotic universality classes will be distinguished by determining whether @xmath76 or @xmath6 .",
    "although the peculiar kinetics of the systems with @xmath20 was noticed quite early , so far nearly all of the research has been concentrated on the systems in which both of the diffusion constants @xmath2 and @xmath13 are nonzero .",
    "closer inspection of the powerful methods developed in the last decade to investigate the reaction - diffusion systems reveals that only the scaling ansatz , which is a purely mathematical concept , can be trivially employed to investigate both kinds of the systems .",
    "however , since even this relatively simple approach has so far been carried out only for the ` dynamic ' problem @xcite , the theories of the two asymptotic universality classes remain practically disconnected .",
    "several factors have lead to this situation .",
    "theoretical results @xcite derived for the case @xmath20 utilized the basic property of such systems , immobility of particles b , in a way that can not be extended for systems with @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the fundamental techniques developed for the case @xmath6 has been based on the quasistationary approximation which requires that the ratio @xmath77 of two opposite currents of particles a and b entering the reaction zone should asymptotically go to 1 . this condition can not be met by the systems with @xmath76 , as in this case @xmath78 .",
    "the aim of our paper is to unify our understanding of these two kinds of the reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "the procedure we are using consists in detailed examination of the case @xmath76 and comparison of the results with those already derived for @xmath6 .",
    "we study the systems with @xmath76 by means of various methods and for arbitrary ( positive ) values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 .",
    "in particular we show the counterpart of the quasistationary approximation ( [ stac ] ) which should be used if @xmath20 .",
    "we argue that the form of these equations , as well as their boundary conditions , determine the properties of the asymptotic universality classes . in subsequent sections we study these properties for the systems with @xmath76 using the heuristic theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , the scaling ansatz , the mean - field approximation , and numerical analysis .",
    "although some aspects of the systems with @xmath76 turn out to be the same as of those with @xmath6 , our analysis implies that these two cases should always be considered separately .",
    "consider equations ( [ cfeq ] )  ( [ rb ] ) with the values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 fixed at some positive values , and @xmath13 going to 0 .",
    "for physical reasons we expect that as @xmath13 goes to 0 , @xmath59 converges to some nonzero limiting value , and so the argument of @xmath79 on the right hand side of ( [ cfeq ] ) diverges to infinity .",
    "we can therefore use an asymptotic property of the error function , @xmath80 as @xmath81 @xcite , and reduce ( [ cfeq ] ) to @xmath82 since @xmath83 diminishes monotonically from @xmath84 to @xmath85 as @xmath33 grows from @xmath86 to @xmath84 , the above equation has a unique , positive solution .",
    "consequently , ( [ cf ] ) and ( [ cj ] ) imply that @xmath63 and @xmath66 also converge to some positive values , but @xmath67 rapidly diverges to infinity",
    ".    one can now use ( [ cf ] ) , ( [ cj ] ) and ( [ cfeq0 ] ) to arrive , after some algebra , at an important relation valid only if @xmath20 @xmath87 this equation has a very natural physical interpretation .",
    "on the one hand the total number @xmath88 of reactions occurring by time @xmath34 is asymptotically equal @xmath89 on the other hand , however , for @xmath70 we have @xmath90 , and for @xmath68 we expect @xmath91 . neglecting terms of order @xmath92 we thus conclude that @xmath88 can as well be estimated by @xmath93 { \\d } x \\,\\sim\\ ,    b_0 { x_{\\mathrm{f}}}(t )   \\,\\sim\\ ,    b_0 { c_{\\mathrm{f}}}\\sqrt{t } \\,,\\ ] ] which leads to ( [ relcfcj ] ) .",
    "our theory is consistent with the numerical simulations of larralde _ et al _ @xcite , who considered the one dimensional system ( i.e. for @xmath94 ) with @xmath76 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "they found that , respectively , for @xmath97 , 1000 and 5000 the value of @xmath98 was approximately equal to @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our equation ( [ cfeq0 ] ) , whose numerical solution reads @xmath106 .",
    "below , in section [ nums ] , we will also verify our theory using the mean - field approximation ( i.e.  for @xmath107 ) .",
    "let @xmath76 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 take on arbitrary ( positive ) values .",
    "assume that the asymptotic solutions of the glfi and rcz problem ( [ gr ] ) in the long - time limit take on the scaling form ( [ sa ] )  ( [ sr ] ) with @xmath46 . inserting ( [ sa ] ) and ( [ sb ] ) into ( [ gr ] ) and taking the limit @xmath49 we find that at any @xmath33 such that @xmath108 there is @xmath109 hence , because @xmath46 , in the limit @xmath49 the term @xmath110 becomes negligibly small compared to @xmath111 .",

    "it is easy to see that if length and time are measured in units of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , then the solutions of ( [ qstac ] ) reduce to those obtained for the particular case @xmath142 .",

    "we will now investigate some properties of the limit @xmath56 which could not be analysed within the framework of the general theory presented in section  [ limit ] . as we already showed in our previous paper @xcite , if @xmath6 then the mean - field density of particles b at @xmath50 is asymptotically proportional to @xmath168 .",

    "second , @xmath156 is discontinuous at @xmath194 , which reflects the fact that @xmath11 is discontinuous at @xmath195 .    3.2 in    3.6 in",
    "we have investigated the long - time behaviour of the concentrations @xmath51 and @xmath52 of species a and b in the initially separated diffusion limited systems with @xmath20 .",
    "all of our analysis was carried out for arbitrary values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "first we derived the formulae ( [ cfeq0 ] ) and ( [ relcfcj ] ) which together with ( [ ra ] ) describe the behaviour of @xmath10 outside the reaction zone .",
    "an interesting feature of these equations is that we expect them to be valid for any reaction - diffusion system of the type a @xmath0 b(static ) @xmath1 0  that exhibits the scaling behaviour with @xmath196 .",
    "thus we conclude that many important properties of the reaction - diffusion systems with @xmath76 depend only on the values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 , but not on the explicit form of @xmath5 .",
    "this includes the location of the reaction zone centre ( controlled by @xmath59 ) , the total reaction rate ( controlled by @xmath63 ) , and the concentration profile of particles a outside the reaction zone ( controlled by @xmath66 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "a similar situation is observed in the systems with @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "next we investigated general consequences of the scaling ansatz .",
    "we concluded that it determines the value of @xmath198 and imposes relations ( [ rex2 ] ) and ( [ rex3 ] ) on the values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these relations are also valid for @xmath6 .",
    "we proved that the scaling functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are related by a simple formula  ( [ sasb ] ) .",
    "we also concluded that for @xmath20 the asymptotic forms of @xmath51 and @xmath52 inside the reaction front can be derived from equations ( [ qstac ] ) which are to be solved with time depending boundary conditions ( [ bcro ] ) .",
    "thus these equations determine the asymptotic properties of the reaction front .",
    "we also examined in detail the properties of the reaction zone in the mean - field approximation .",
    "in particular we determined the functional forms of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 far from @xmath50 and the dependence of the width of the reaction zone on @xmath17 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis showed that the main differences in the behaviour of the initially separated reaction - diffusion systems with @xmath20 and @xmath6 arise from the fact that the term @xmath199 can be neglected in ( [ gr ] ) only if the corresponding diffusion constant @xmath13 is nonzero .",
    "therefore , depending on whether @xmath13 is zero or not , the long - time behaviour of the reaction front is governed by entirely different partial differential equations .",
    "if @xmath21 , then we use the usual quasistationary equations ( [ stac ] ) , otherwise we must employ ( [ qstac ] ) .",
    "the different forms of these equations and their boundary conditions imply the different forms of their solutions and , consequently , different asymptotic properties of the two universality classes . therefore the cases @xmath76 and @xmath6 should always be considered separately .",
    "there is , however , evidence that in some special cases the two asymptotic universality classes may be very much alike .",
    "such surprising conclusion follows from the extensive numerical simulations of the one dimensional system carried recently out by cornell @xcite .",
    "he considered a system with @xmath200 and concluded that @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and that asymptotically @xmath5 is a gaussian centred at @xmath50 with its width growing as @xmath203 .",
    "the same results were derived analytically for the one dimensional system with @xmath76 by larralde _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "note also that this form of @xmath5 , or more generally  any @xmath5 that depends on @xmath33 and @xmath34 explicitly rather than through @xmath10 and @xmath11 , uniquely determines the form of @xmath10 .",
    "this comes from the fact that whether or not @xmath20 , asymptotical forms of @xmath51 and @xmath5 are related by the same differential equation @xmath204 with the same boundary conditions .",
    "therefore it is quite possible that the only difference between the one dimensional systems with @xmath20 and @xmath197 lies in the form of @xmath25 and the value of @xmath38",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that the asymptotic kinetics of one dimensional systems with @xmath6 has recently become the subject of controversial discussions @xcite , and further exploration of this topic is still required before the final conclusions can be made ."
