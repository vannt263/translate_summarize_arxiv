    "at crystal surfaces the symmetry is lowered : the three dimensional periodicity in the bulk is lowered to the two dimensional periodicity at the surface .",
    "this leads to the occurrence of two - dimensional surface states @xcite , which are spatially confined to the surface , since their wave functions decay rapidly into the crystal and are strongly damped in the vacuum .",
    "surface states can exist only in regions of the two - dimensional brillouin zone , where bulk bloch states are not allowed .",
    "they are characterized by a two - dimensional bloch vector @xmath3 in this surface brillouin zone , which describes the propagation in the surface plane .",
    "a projection of the bulk band structure to the surface plane can result in @xmath4-regions , where bulk states are forbidden . in these gaps of the projected bulk band structure surface states",
    "can occur provided that their energy is lower than the work function .",
    "these two conditions guarantee that the wave functions of the surface states decay exponentially both into the crystal and into the vacuum region .    recently",
    "a strong interest arose concerning an important physical effect associated with the interaction of a two dimensional surface state with the states of an adatom .",
    "it was shown that for cu adatoms on cu(111 ) a bound state splits off from the bottom of the cu(111 ) surface state@xcite .",
    "this effect was basically predicted by simon @xcite who stated that in two - dimensional free space any attractive potential has a bound state .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that an adatom  induced localization of the surface state may be observed in sts as a peak appearing just below the surface band edge when a cs adatom is deposited on cu(111 ) .    using low  temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) , limot _",
    "_  @xcite investigated silver and cobalt adatoms on ag(111 ) as well as copper and cobalt adatoms on cu(111 ) .",
    "the bound state appears both for magnetic and nonmagnetic adatoms .",
    "moreover , using a newns  anderson model the authors explained the results as arising from the coupling of the adatom s orbital ( which was supposed to be the @xmath2orbital ) with the surface - state electrons , and being broadened by the interaction with bulk electrons of the same energy . on the other hand , olsson _",
    "@xcite used the same type of experiment and performed pseudopotential calculations for single cu adatoms on cu(111 ) .",
    "the calculated local density of states ( ldos ) exhibits several adatom  induced peaks .",
    "two of them are assigned to resonances deriving from the @xmath5 atomic orbital and @xmath6 hybrid orbitals .",
    "the third one corresponds to a localization of the surface state at the adatom without a specified orbital origin .",
    "in fact , these adatom - induced peaks appearing at the bottom of the surface state were already observed by an other experiment @xcite , again without a clear assignment of their origin .",
    "et al._@xcite have observed similar localized states in sts measurements for cr atoms in the surface layer of fe(001 ) surface .",
    "ab - initio calculations of papanikolaou _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite confirmed this and showed that similar localized states occur for many other impurities in the fe(001 ) surface .    in this work we study the origin and the condition of existence for such an impurity  induced split - off state on the cu(111 ) surface .",
    "for this purpose we have performed ab ",
    "initio calculations using the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green function method for impurities on the cu(111 ) surface .",
    "we consider single impurities of the 3_d _ and 4_sp _ elements as adatoms on the cu(111 ) surface and as impurities in the first layer .",
    "we find that split - off states can appear both for adatoms on the surface as well as for substitutional impurities in the surface . in the case of magnetic impurities",
    "these states always appear in both spin channels and show a very small spin splitting .",
    "in the present work we use the full  potential kkr green function method  @xcite . this method is ideal for treating systems involving impurities on or in surfaces and in bulk crystals . within the kkr method",
    "the impurities are described by considering a cluster of perturbed atomic potentials which includes the potentials of the impurities and the perturbed potentials of several neighbor shells .",
    "also in the vacuum region the space is filled by cellular potentials , of which the ones close to the impurity are perturbed .",
    "the impurity potential and the perturbed potentials of the neighboring cells are embedded in an otherwise ideal unperturbed surface .",
    "the kkr method is based on multiple  scattering theory . for non  overlapping potentials",
    "the following angular momentum representation of the green s function @xmath7 can be derived : @xmath8    here @xmath9 is the energy and @xmath10 , @xmath11 refers to the atomic positions . @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote respectively the shorter and longer of the vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 which define the position in the wigner  seitz ( ws ) cell centered around @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the regular and irregular solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the structural green functions @xmath20 are then obtained by solving the dyson equation for each spin direction    @xmath21    the summation in ( [ eq:2 ] ) is over all lattice sites @xmath22 and angular momenta @xmath23 , @xmath24 for which the perturbation @xmath25 between the @xmath26 matrices of the real and the reference system is significant .",
    "@xmath27 are the structural green function of the reference system , _",

    "we have checked these cut - offs to be adequate for our purpose .",
    "first , the surface green functions were determined for the surface of cu(111 ) .",
    "the lattice lsda equilibrium parameter was used ( 6.63 _ a.u .",
    "_ @xmath30 3.51  ) . to describe the impurities on the surface",
    ", we consider a cluster of perturbed potentials which includes the potentials of the impurities and the perturbed potentials of several neighbors shell , with typical size of 29 perturbed sites for the adatoms .",
    "all adatoms are assumed to sit at the hollow position in the first vacuum layer . in the following ,",
    "we take as reference energy the fermi level @xmath31 .    according to the tersoff - hamann model @xcite the scanning tunneling spectra",
    "can be related to the @xmath2-dos induced by the surface or by the adatom at the position of the sts tip . adopting this model",
    ", we calculate the @xmath2-ldos at a distance @xmath32 = 2.86   directly above the adatom .",
    "this corresponds to a lattice position in the third vacuum layer above the surface .",
    "resonance . ]    the calculated ldos for 3_d _ adatoms presented in fig.[total ] exhibit several adatom  induced peaks .",
    "the ldos refer to an unoccupied _ lattice position _ in the third vacuum layer above the surface , _ i.e. _ 2.86   above the single adatoms in the first vacuum layer .",
    "we focused on the region where the split - off state appears experimentally , _",
    "i.e. _ , around the bottom of the surface state , which in the actual calculations is located at @xmath330.68 ev .",
    "we note that experimentally , the threshold energy is higher and is situated at @xmath330.45 ev@xcite .",
    "this inconsistency is due to the lda equilibrium lattice parameter we used since a test calculation with the experimental lattice parameter gives a value of @xmath330.49 ev for the threshold energy .",
    "let us start with a cu adatom .",
    "below e@xmath34 , fig.[total ] shows that two states appear in the ldos .",
    "the first one ( see arrow ( a ) in fig.[total ] ) is a split - off state situated at the bottom of the surface state ( @xmath30  @xmath330.68 ev ) as was already found by limot _ et al._@xcite and by olsson _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "to understand the origin of the second protrusion ( see arrow ( b ) ) we plot in fig.[total2 ] the @xmath0-partial ldos of the adatoms which shows that it comes from a resonance of the @xmath35 state at @xmath30  @xmath331.7 ev .",
    "adatoms on cu(111 ) surface .",
    "the full lines describe the majority - spin states and the dashed lines describe the minority - spin states .",
    "since the cu adatom is non - magnetic , the majority and minority virtual bond states coincide . ]    for all the 3@xmath0-adatoms examined , we find for both spin directions a peak in the ldos in the region below the threshold value of the surface state .",
    "however , we also find peaks at other energies , _",
    "e.g. _ for cu at @xmath331.7 ev as mentioned earlier and for co at @xmath331.5 ev for spin - up and at around 0 ev for spin - down states . in order to understand this behavior",
    ", we have in first place to understand the electronic and magnetic properties of the impurities and then which of the impurity states penetrate well into the vacuum , such that they show up in the ldos of the second layer and can be detected by the stm .",
    "let us first address the second question",
    ". in the vacuum region states with small in - plane @xmath36-components @xmath4 decay most slowly as a function of the perpendicular distance z from the surface .",
    "in fact , for a given energy @xmath37 below the vacuum barrier , a wave function with in - plane component @xmath4 decays as @xmath38 .",
    "therefore states with small @xmath4-values decay slowest ; for higher @xmath39 part of the kinetic energy is `` absorbed '' by in - plane oscillations . since the states with @xmath40 show no in - plane oscillations and exhibit the full symmetry of the surface , we find that for the ( 111 ) surface states with @xmath2 , @xmath41 and @xmath35 show a slow decay in the vacuum region and can be well seen in stm , while other @xmath42- and @xmath0-states are strongly attenuated .",
    "an analogous argument holds for single adatoms on the ( 111 ) surface , since only these states exhibit the full point symmetry of the adatom - on - surface configuration  @xcite , and have thus no oscillations to absorb part of the kinetic energy .    to understand the magnetic properties of the adatoms , we have plotted in fig.[total2 ] the @xmath0-contribution to the local density of states ( ldos ) at the adatom site . for the cu - adatom , we find a sharp @xmath0-peak at @xmath331.7 ev , _",
    "i.e. _ at the edge of the bulk @xmath0-band of cu .",
    "this is a consequence of the repulsive potential , which the cu adatom experiences in the first layer , shifting the @xmath0 states to higher energies than in the bulk .",
    "all other impurities are magnetic and exhibit sizable moments , leading to a spin splitting of the so - called virtual bound states .",
    "for the different adatoms , the calculated local moments m@xmath43 are : cr ( 4.06 @xmath44 ) , mn ( 4.28 @xmath44 ) , fe ( 3.21 @xmath44 ) , co ( 1.96 @xmath44 ) and ni ( 0.34 @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that the spin splitting is roughly given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the exchange integral of the order of 1 ev@xcite . in the case of the cr adatom , the minority peak is at higher energies and can not be seen in fig.[total2 ] , while for fe and mn the majority peaks are at lower energies .",
    "let us now come back to the interpretation of fig.[total ] , showing the ldos in the second vacuum layer , at the position above the adatom , for majority and minority electrons .",
    "independently of the peak structure , we observe a general increase of the dos at higher energies , which arises from the increase of the spatial extent of the wave functions for larger energies . for cu , the peak at @xmath331.7",
    "ev coincides with the @xmath35-peak in the local dos of the adatom , shown in fig.[total2 ] . for clarification",
    "we show in fig.[total3 ] the local @xmath2-dos and the @xmath35-dos of the adatoms ( the latter reduced by a factor of 10 ) . for cu , as well as for the majority states of co , we see a maximum and minimum in the @xmath2-ldos at the @xmath35-peak position , arising from the fano - like resonant scattering of the @xmath2-states at the @xmath35-resonance .",
    "this effect can not occur for a single adatom in free space or in jellium , since the @xmath2- and @xmath0-orbitals are orthogonal .",
    "therefore it is brought about by the reduced symmetry , _ i.e. _ the scattering at the substrate atoms .",
    "the ldos - peak below @xmath330.68 ev ( arrow ( a ) ) is the split - off state of the cu adatom , induced by the attractive nature of the adatom potential in the first vacuum layer .",
    "the same states are also seen for the co - adatom , more or less identical for both spin directions .",
    "in addition we see for the minority @xmath2-state of co a fano - like resonance behavior at the fermi level , arising from the interaction with the minority @xmath35-virtual bound states .",
    "-partial ldos ( black curves ) of the impurity atoms and @xmath35-partial ldos ( red curves ) reduced by a factor 10 .",
    "full lines represent majority spin , dashed lines minority spin . ]    in the case of the ni adatoms the virtual bound states for the two spin directions are only weakly split and more or less coincide with the energy level of the split - off surface state .",
    "therefore in the local @xmath2-dos both effects , the formation of the split - off state and the resonant scattering at the @xmath35 resonances , can not be distinguished .",
    "however , in the vacuum region ( fig.[total ] ) the spin splitting of the majority and minority @xmath35-states can be clearly seen .    for fe- , mn- and cr - adatoms",
    "another effect can be seen in the vacuum ldos ( fig.[total ] ) and the local @xmath2-dos in fig.[total3 ] .",
    "the intensity in the majority split - off surface state is considerably higher than for the minority state .",
    "this can have several reasons .",
    "for instance , due to the exchange splitting the majority potential is somewhat stronger than the minority one , leading to a smaller lateral extension of the split - off states and to a larger intensity on the adatom site . in particular in the case of cr , also the resonant interaction with the impurity @xmath35 virtual bound state",
    "becomes important , strongly increasing the majority intensity on the impurity site as well as in vacuum .",
    "moreover , we have noticed a small peak appearing in the mn- and fe - adatom majority @xmath0-ldos ( see arrow ( c ) in fig.[total2 ] ) at the same position where the virtual bound states of cu - adatom is situated ( _ i.e. _ @xmath30 @xmath331.7 ev ) .",
    "however these protrusions have a different origin since there is no peak at @xmath331.7 ev in the @xmath35-ldos for mn- and fe - adatom contrary to cu- or co - adatoms ( see fig.[total3 ] ) .",
    "they appear at the remaining @xmath0-partial ldos ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) which are strongly damped in the vacuum . for symmetry reasons they do not hybridize with the @xmath2-ldos explaining",
    "thus why we do not see a peak at the @xmath2-ldos of mn and fe - adatoms contrary to cu and co - adatoms .",
    "we believe , however , these peaks can be interpreted as split - off states from a surface state at the @xmath51 point@xcite , which shows a negative dispersion , such that a repulsive impurity potential leads for these @xmath0-states to a split - off state at higher energies , _ i.e. _ above the corresponding surface band .     versus the potential .",
    "full lines correspond to a negative potential while blue one describe the case of positive potential ( always repulsive ) .",
    "the figure is obtained with a small positive energy value for an elastic @xmath2-scattering by a rectangular spherical potential depth . ]    * _ sp_-impurities as adatoms : * we consider now some @xmath1-impurities as adatoms , for which the behavior is not complicated by the spin polarized @xmath0-states . as first candidate",
    "we consider ca at the beginning of the 3@xmath0-series .",
    "the calculations give a well defined split - off state at the same position as for cu and the 3@xmath0 impurities , _",
    "i.e. _ below the minimum of the surface band .",
    "in addition we perform calculations for zn , ga and ge adatoms .",
    "the split - off state is still seen for zn but not anymore for ga and ge atoms .",
    "the reason for this is that in the ldos of ga and ge adatoms the @xmath2-states have moved to lower energies below the surface state minimum . in this case",
    "the @xmath2-scattering at the adatoms becomes effectively repulsive , so that no split - off state occurs .",
    "to explain this we note that the scattering behavior of a scattering center is directly related to the @xmath52-matrix , and only indirectly to the potential .",
    "our results are in contradiction with the usual statement that any attractive potential leads to a split - off state of a two - dimensional surface state .",
    "this is not correct in our case , since the @xmath52-matrix of the adatom is basically a three - dimensional quantity . for @xmath2-scattering",
    "the @xmath52-matrix is for low energies @xmath53 given by the so - called scattering length _ a _ , being discussed in many books on quantum mechanics .",
    "the quantity _ a _ is the length where the extrapolation of the asymptotic form of the wave function for @xmath54 vanishes . for the simple model of spherical potential well of depth @xmath55 and radius @xmath56 the scattering length @xmath57",
    "is plotted in fig.[sinus ] . for a repulsive potential",
    "the scattering length is positive and approaches the well radius @xmath56 for large @xmath55 . for a weakly attractive potential @xmath57",
    "is negative .",
    "however when the potential @xmath55 becomes stronger attractive , the scattering length assumes more stronger negative values , until it jumps . at a critical strength @xmath58 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , and is positive for further increased @xmath55-values . at the critical strength @xmath61 a bound state appears at @xmath54 , moving to lower energies for further increased negative @xmath55 values , and making the scattering length positive as for a repulsive potential . to compare with the real situations of the adatoms ,",
    "the potential of the transition metal atoms is sufficiently weak , that a split - off state exist , since the atomic 4@xmath2-level is far above the fermi level , and the scattering length is negative .",
    "however for the ge adatom the @xmath2-level has moved below the minimum of the surface state , so that the scattering length is positive and no split - off state exists .",
    "when progressing in the atomic table a split - off state can only appear again , when in the next series of the elements , say from rb to ag , the 5@xmath2-level has moved down towards the fermi level .",
    "@xmath331.3 ev on the majority spin channel which are due to the @xmath0 state of the co adatom . ]    * impurities in the surface layer : * the scattering of the surface states at impurities in the first surface layer is basically different from the scattering of @xmath2-electrons , since the effective potential for scattering is the difference between the potential of the impurity and the potential of the substituted cu atom .",
    "therefore all 3@xmath0-impurities in the first layer do not show any split - off surface state , since the potential difference is very small ( and moreover slightly repulsive ) . on the other hand for ge impurities in the first layer",
    ", the calculations yield a split - off state , as is shown by the small peak in fig.[compare ] .",
    "apparently the difference in potential is sufficiently attractive , such that a weakly localized state is formed .",
    "therefore we obtain the opposite trend as for the adatoms .",
    "transition metal impurities exhibit a split - off surface state as adatoms , but not as substitutional impurities in the first layer , whereas for ga and ge just the opposite is true .",
    "we no discuss the limitations of our calculations , in particular concerning the kondo effect which can not be captured by the lsda .",
    "it is well - known that , at low temperatures , the spin moment of the magnetic impurities fluctuates , so that these appear non - magnetic . the temperatures at which the experiments are conducted are in many cases below the kondo temperature ; _",
    "e.g. _ , a characteristic kondo feature in the spectra was observed for co on cu in ref@xcite .",
    "the kondo effect is characterized by a narrow abrikosov - suhl resonance of the dos at @xmath31 which is absent in our calculations .",
    "however , the split - off states are well below @xmath31",
    ". furthermore , the abrikosov - suhl appears by the interaction of impurity @xmath2-states with the surface band .",
    "therefore our results on the split - off state are physically relevant .    on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - dependent spectra of the magnetic impurities should be corrected towards an averaging of the two spin channels , if the temperature is below the kondo temperature .",
    "although the kondo fluctuations kill the magnetic moment , the splitting of the @xmath0 virtual bound states remains , corresponding to single- and double- occupancy of the impurity local state .",
    "we have performed self - consistent calculations on single impurities deposited on cu(111 ) surface in order to investigate the split - off state recently seen in experiment@xcite .",
    "we show the existence of two kinds of state localizations : one is due to an attractive potential below the @xmath62 surface state and the other one is due to a repulsive potential above the @xmath51 surface state .",
    "we found that ca , all 3@xmath0 and zn adatoms produce the first resonance which is not the case for the @xmath1 adatoms ga and ge even if fundamentally it is known that any attractive potential should lead to a split - off state at the bottom of a two - dimensional electron state .",
    "its presence for ca means that @xmath2 states have a stronger contribution to its realization then @xmath0 states .",
    "the behavior is totally different if the impurities are embedded in the surface layer .",
    "in particular , ga and ge lead to a protrusion at the bottom of the surface state .",
    "one question addressed in this work is how to explain the non - existence of state localizations for @xmath1-adatoms and 3@xmath0-impurities embedded in the first surface layer . in the latter case ,",
    "the reference potential is then the cu one which is not too different from the potentials of all 3@xmath0 impurities .",
    "therefore we do not see any localization .",
    "the case of @xmath1 adatoms is explained by the sign change of the scattering length for attractive potentials , which then may act effectively as repulsive potentials .",
    "we would like to thank laurent limot and richard berndt for fruitful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft for financial support via the priority programme `` clusters in contact with surfaces '' ( spp 1153 ) ."
