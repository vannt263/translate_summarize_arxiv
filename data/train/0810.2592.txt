    "spherically confined dust crystals have recently attracted large attention , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for an overview . after the exploration of the ground state structure @xcite and of metastable states and their probability @xcite a question of particular interest is the dynamical excitation spectrum .",
    "the normal modes are a key property describing the response of a finite system to external excitation and also the melting behavior , e.g. @xcite . particularly interesting is the situation in dusty plasmas where the normal mode spectrum of two - dimensional crystals could be analyzed experimentally , e.g. @xcite . here , we extend this analysis to three - dimensional spherical yukwa crystals ( yukawa balls ) and present experimental results . from the theory side , we recall the determination of the normal modes of confined systems .",
    "we concentrate on one of the key modes  the breathing mode ( bm ) describing uniform expansion and contraction of the whole system .",
    "recently it was shown @xcite that a `` true '' ( i.e. uniform ) bm does not exist in yukawa systems .",
    "instead , there may exist several similar modes which , however , all deviate either from uniform or radial motion of the particles .",
    "the brief derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite is reproduced here in a more detailed way .",
    "one of the important consequences  the possible existence of multiple monopole modes  is demonstrated .",
    "finally , we take into account the effect of dissipation on the normal mode spectrum which is crucial for dusty plasmas .",
    "the crystals are characterized by a @xmath0-dimensional , classical system of @xmath1 identical particles harmonically confined by the potential @xmath2 and interacting with a yukawa - type pair interaction @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then given by ( @xmath4 indicates no summation over equal indices ) @xmath5 to investigate the spectral properties of dusty plasma crystals at low temperatures we consider small excitations from a ground state or metastable state @xmath6 , which is a minimum of the potential energy and thus fulfills the equations @xmath7 the small excitation is a time - dependent function @xmath8 in the configuration space with @xmath9 . due to the small amplitude of the oscillation",
    "the potential can be approximated harmonically by @xmath10 where we used ( [ eq : equilibrium_positions ] ) and the definition of the hessian matrix @xmath11 .",
    "because @xmath12 is a real symmetric @xmath13-matrix and positive semidefinite as well , its eigenvalue problem @xcite @xmath14 defines @xmath15 eigenvalues @xmath16 and @xmath15 linearly independent eigenvectors @xmath17 , which form a basis in the configuration space and may be conveniently chosen orthonormal . within this basis",
    "the excitation can be expanded @xmath18 so that the time - dependence is fully determined by the coefficients @xmath19  the normal coordinates .",
    "these normal coordinates obey equations of motion , which follow from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) @xmath20{{\\bf\\it}r}_j .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] because the eigenvectors @xmath17 are linearly independent each normal coordinate @xmath19 fulfills @xmath21 with the solution @xmath22 in which the constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 have to be determined from the initial conditions @xmath25 of the excitation .",
    "thus in general , the excitation relative to the ground state , @xmath26 , is a superposition of oscillating motions @xmath27 , called normal modes .",
    "each such normal mode describes a collective motion of all particles oscillating with the same frequency @xmath28  the normal frequency .",
    "the respective displacements of the particles are given by the eigenvector @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , in order to investigate the spectral properties of the dusty plasma crystals we have to investigate the normal modes , and hence have to consider the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : eigenvalue_problem ] ) of the hessian @xmath12 .    for harmonically confined coulomb systems ( @xmath30 )",
    "detailed theoretical studies have been performed for @xmath31 dimensions , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it was shown that there exist three ( partially degenerate ) normal modes , which are independent of the particle number @xmath1 :    1 .",
    "the @xmath32 rotational modes with @xmath33 , which correspond to a rotation of the whole system and reflect the axial symmetries of the confinement .",
    "2 .   the @xmath34 center of mass oscillation modes with @xmath35 expressing that the center of mass motion is independent of the interparticle forces .",
    "3 .   the breathing mode ( bm ) with @xmath36 , which describes a uniform radial expansion and contraction of all particles .",
    "the existence of these three modes is illustrated for the two - dimensional system with @xmath37 particles in figure [ fig : normal_modes ] , where all modes of these systems corresponding to the ground state configuration are shown .",
    "the dots picture the particles within a ground state configuration , and the arrows show the direction of the oscillatory motion .",
    "the @xmath1-independent modes , i.e. , the rotational modes , the modes of center of mass oscillation ( c.o.m . ) , and the breathing modes are highlighted . ]",
    "for harmonically confined yukawa systems the interaction potential and thus the hessian @xmath12 depend on a screening parameter @xmath38 . hence , in general , the normal modes will depend on this parameter as well . within figure [ fig : modes_with_screening ] this situation",
    "is shown .",
    "-dependence of the normal modes of a harmonically confined yukawa system with @xmath39 particles vs. screening parameter .",
    "the rotational modes , the center of mass oscillations and the breathing mode are highlighted dash - dotted ( red ) , dashed ( green ) , and ( blue ) dot , respectively.,width=377 ]    there , the frequencies of all normal modes are shown for the ground state of harmonically confined yukawa systems with @xmath39 particles and a screening parameter ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the figure shows , that there are two mode frequencies independent from screening  corresponding to the rotational modes and the center of mass oscillation modes .",
    "these modes exist also in a yukawa system ( and have @xmath38-independent frequencies ) due to the symmetries of the systems @xcite .",
    "however , in general this is not the case for the breathing mode , which has no @xmath38-independent frequency .",
    "actually , the general existence of this mode is a special property of coulomb - like interactions not featured in yukawa systems @xcite .",
    "the existence condition of the bm becomes clear by analyzing the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : eigenvalue_problem ] ) .",
    "the standard procedure to evaluate this equation is to find the roots of its characteristic polynomial yielding all eigenvalues and -vectors and to examine whether there exists an eigenvector @xmath41 corresponding to a bm , i.e. , describing a uniform and radial motion @xmath42 .",
    "however , the degree of this equation is @xmath43 which prohibits an analytical calculation of the eigenvalues and -vectors and , consequently , prohibits general statements about the existence of the bm .",
    "therefore , we apply a different approach  the direct mode approach  which focuses on just one mode : within the eigenvalue equation we directly use the eigenvector of the breathing mode , which thus leads to the existence condition of this mode .    additionally , we evaluate ( [ eq : eigenvalue_problem ] ) within its particle components @xmath44 , because the potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given for these , and obtain @xmath47 using the isotropy of @xmath45 and the distance dependence of @xmath46 one obtains for each component of the hessian @xmath48\\delta_{il}\\\\          & \\qquad+\\sideset{}{'}\\sum_{\\substack{k=1}}^n          \\biggl[\\frac{v'({\\vert{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*\\vert})}{{\\vert{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*\\vert}}{\\mathcal i}_3+\\frac{{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*{{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*}^t}{{\\vert{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*\\vert}^3 }          \\bigl({\\vert{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*\\vert}v''({\\vert{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*\\vert})-v'({\\vert{{\\bf}r}_{lk}^*\\vert})\\bigr)\\biggr]\\bigl(\\delta_{il}-\\delta_{ik}\\bigr ) ,      \\end{split}\\ ] ] wherein @xmath49 denotes the three - dimensional identity matrix .",
    "thus ( [ eq : eigenvalue_problem_components ] ) reduces to @xmath50 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] now we use the aforementioned direct mode approach , i.e. , we set the eigenvector @xmath51 equal to the unit eigenvector of the bm @xmath52 , which consequently leads to the existence conditions of this mode @xmath53 these conditions show @xcite , that a breathing mode only exists in harmonically confined systems with interaction potentials of the form @xmath54 @xmath55 or @xmath56 , or in some highly symmetric systems .    the breathing mode and its existence is closely related to the monopole oscillation ( mo ) @xcite , which in strongly correlated systems is associated with the oscillation of the mean square radius @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this mo is particulary important since it can be easily excited selectively by variation of the trap frequency @xmath58 , e.g. , by a rapid change of the frequency @xmath58 of the equilibrated system corresponding to the excitation given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    in the case",
    "that a system has a bm , the mo describes the same motion as the bm and thus has the same frequency .",
    "however , in the opposite case , as for most yukawa systems , there are several monopole oscillations with different frequencies .",
    "this property is directly apparent in the spectrum @xmath61 of the mean square radius motion @xmath62 which may be derived by the square of its fourier transform @xmath63 . for the mentioned excitation",
    "the normal coordinates are given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , for small amplitudes ( @xmath66 ) the spectrum is given by @xmath67 if the bm exists , one eigenvector @xmath29 is given by @xmath41 , which is parallel to @xmath68 , whereas all other eigenvectors are orthogonal to @xmath68 .",
    "hence the spectrum contains only a single peak at the breathing frequency .",
    "in contrast , if no bm exists , generally many eigenvectors @xmath29 will have a non - vanishing projection on @xmath68 [ cf .",
    "figure [ fig : bm_in_3n_space ] b ) ] , so that the spectrum contains several mo with different frequencies @xmath69 and amplitudes .    within figure [ fig : spectrum ]",
    "a ) such a spectrum is shown for a yukawa ball with @xmath39 particles and a screening strength of @xmath70 .",
    "one clearly sees two peaks , thus this system contains two different monopole oscillations .",
    "the corresponding frequencies are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .     containing two monopole modes , obtained from numerical nma for a yukawa ball with @xmath39 particles and a screening strength of @xmath70 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the position of the poles of equation ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) .",

    "[ ex_s ] a very intriguing experimental realization of harmonically confined ( screened ) coulomb systems are the so - called yukawa balls in dusty plasmas . there , a finite number of plastic microspheres are dropped into the plasma of a parallel plate rf discharge . in the plasma ,",
    "the particles arrange in concentric spherical shells ( see e.g. @xcite ) which is expected to be the ground state configuration of harmonically trapped 3d charged - particle systems @xcite .    the harmonic confinement in the plasma is realized by a combination of various plasma forces on the microspheres . in the vertical direction ,",
    "the action of gravity is compensated by an upward force due to the electric field in the space - charge sheath above the lower electrode and an upward thermophoretic force due to heating of the lower electrode .",
    "horizontally , the particles are confined by a glass cube placed onto the electrode .",
    "this results in a 3d harmonic confinement of the charged microspheres ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "the charge on the typically used microspheres of @xmath74 m diameter is of the order of @xmath75 elementary charges , the interparticle distance is of about @xmath76 m , and the shielding length in the plasma is of the same order as the interparticle distance .",
