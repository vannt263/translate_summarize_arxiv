    "<S> we investigate the phase diagram and the critical properties of the adsorbate system sulphur / ruthenium(0001 ) in the coverage region @xmath0 by means of monte - carlo simulations of a simple lattice gas model on a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the model contains only repulsive nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions . combining results obtained by using both glauber and kawasaki kinetics in the simulations we identify two tricritical points , three coexistence regions and a eutectic point in the phase diagram of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our results agree with the findings of recent experimental work on s / ru(0001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we are able to add certain details to the experimentally observed phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs 0550 - lattice theory and statistics ; ising problems + pacs 6470 - phase equilibria , phase transitions , and critical points    the comparison of experimental phase diagrams and of experimental data for the critical properties of adsorbed layers with the results of computer simulations of appropriate lattice gas models can provide detailed information about the effective lateral interactions between the adsorbed particles . however , the reliability of this method depends on the validity of the lattice gas description for the system to be considered . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this point requires careful experimental tests . </S>",
    "<S> the inadequacy of the lattice gas description may be the reason for the quantitative disagreement between the simulated @xcite and the experimental @xcite phase diagrams of some systems .    </S>",
    "<S> for the system s / ru(0001 ) , careful investigations @xcite have revealed that for coverages @xmath1 the s atoms are attached to well defined surface sites . for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> only the the hcp site is occupied while for higher coverages , @xmath3 , one finds adsorbate atoms on the fcc site as well . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for coverages up to @xmath4 the description of the system by lattice gas models appears to be justified . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for this system the comparison between monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations of such models and the rather complex experimentally observed phase diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exphase ] is well founded . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the existence of five different commensurate structures the most interesting features of the phase diagram of s / ru(0001 ) are the striped domain wall phase and the coexistence region of two ordered structures which covers a large area in the interval @xmath0 . to our knowledge , this is the first adsorbate system in which such a prominent coexistence region has been observed . in view of the complexity of this phase diagram </S>",
    "<S> it may seem questionable whether the experimental observations can be reproduced in detail by a reasonably simple lattice gas model .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we shall demonstrate by means of mc simulations that , in fact , a surprisingly simple lattice gas model suffices for a quantitative description of the experimental phase diagram for coverages @xmath5 for which the coexistence region ( region c ) is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this area is bounded on the left by the homogeneous @xmath6 phase ( b ) and by the homogeneous @xmath7 phase on the right ( d ) ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exphase ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ideal coverages ( also referred to as critical coverages ) of the two phases are @xmath8 and @xmath9 resp .. the coexistence region consists of homogeneous islands with @xmath6 and @xmath7 order .    </S>",
    "<S> the lattice gas model with the smallest number of parameters which is able to produce these two structures is @xmath10 as usual , @xmath11 denotes the occupation of the lattice site @xmath12 , and the sums run over the @xmath13 sites of the triangular lattice for nearest ( nn ) and next nearest neighbors ( nnn ) .    </S>",
    "<S> positive coupling constants @xmath14 for the first- and second - nearest neighbor interactions stabilize the @xmath6 structure at @xmath15 ( refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , while the existence of the @xmath7 structure requires that @xmath16 , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of @xmath6 islands at low coverages , fig .  1 , indicates that in a realistic lattice gas model for s / ru(0001 ) a weak attractive third neighbor interaction has to be included . </S>",
    "<S> as we have checked this interaction is of little importance for coverages @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we ignore it in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> similar models have been considered in previous numerical studies of adsorbate systems on square lattices @xcite and of systems on triangular lattices @xcite . for the parameter ratio @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , a monte - carlo simulation of the model ( [ hamilton ] ) has been performed by glosli and plischke @xcite , but a number of questions remained unresolved in their work .    </S>",
    "<S> commonly , simulations have been performed with the use of glauber kinetics i.e. for constant chemical potential @xmath19 ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this requires that a term @xmath20 is added to the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) in order to control the coverage @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> practically , with this technique it turns out to be rather difficult to tune to a coverage that deviates significantly from the ideal coverages . in a monte - carlo run </S>",
    "<S> the system tends to jump between the competing ideal structures , and very long runs are necessary to achieve accurate statistics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this simulation technique does not directly mimic the experimental situation . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are done at constant coverage and not at constant chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> thus it appears appropriate to use kawasaki kinetics @xcite which conserves the coverage .    to obtain a detailed picture of the phase diagram in the intermediate region between the ideal coverages @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> we combine results from both types of simulation techniques .    as a measure for long range order of the @xmath6 type and of the @xmath7 type </S>",
    "<S> we use appropriate order parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 for which explicit expressions can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these quantities allow the independent measurement of the fraction of these structures which constitute the coexistence region .    to characterize the nature of the phase transitions , we calculate the susceptibilities @xmath25 and the specific heat @xmath26 , @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the energy per site and @xmath29 denotes the average over monte - carlo sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> the critical divergences of @xmath26 and @xmath30 in the infinite system appear as maxima for finite @xmath31 . from the size dependence of these maxima </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents @xmath32 and the transition temperature @xmath33 can be determined @xcite .    in simulations at constant chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> the coverage @xmath34 fluctuates as a function of the temperature @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 does not necessarily couple to the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clearly of interest for first order phase transitions : while the chemical potential and the temperature have to be equal in both phases the coverage jumps discontinuously at the transition .    in our simulations we work with triangular lattices with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice sizes vary between @xmath37 and @xmath38 sites . because of the different unit cells of the @xmath6 and and of the @xmath7 structures we have to change the linear dimension @xmath31 in steps of @xmath39 to avoid frustration by boundary effects . </S>",
    "<S> each data point is obtained from @xmath40 to @xmath41 monte - carlo sweeps .    </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the order - disorder transition temperatures at the ideal coverages @xmath42 measured in the experiment @xcite is used to fix the coupling constant @xmath43 in units of @xmath44 . as usual </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath45 and measure all energies in units of this nn coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the direct comparison of results from both types of simulations . </S>",
    "<S> agreement with the experiment is established with @xmath46 .    at the coverages @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> both kinetics can be used for the determination of critical properties because the chemical potential is practically constant across the transition temperature . by comparison of the critical exponents with the results obtained from the experiment and with the values predicted by the landau rules @xcite we are able to check our routines . </S>",
    "<S> our finite size analysis reveals that glauber kinetics and kawasaki kinetics lead to identical results for both coverages : the maximum of the specific heat at @xmath48 has a size dependence @xmath49 with @xmath50 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ c025 ] , while the susceptibility @xmath51 yields @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> these exponents are comparable with the exact values of the @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) potts model @xmath55 ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and with the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> previous simulations of lattice gas models with @xmath6 and @xmath7 symmetries have yielded similar differences between the lattice gas exponents and the potts exponents @xcite .    as we have discussed above , </S>",
    "<S> kawasaki kinetics is the appropriate tool to analyze the ordered structures in the intermediate coverage region , @xmath0 , and the boundaries between these structures . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently low temperatures we find that particles added to the @xmath6 structure do not appear as point defects but as islands of @xmath7 order . due to the interfacial tension this _ minority _ phase forms hexagons in a sea of the ideal @xmath6 phase ( _ majority _ phase ) . at @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> both domains occupy half the available area . above @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> the roles are interchanged , i.e. the denser @xmath7 structure becomes the majority phase which surrounds islands of @xmath6 phase . </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence line of the region iii , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ myphase ] ) , in which the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 structure coexist , is determined by the disappearance of the order parameter measuring the minority domains .    clearly </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of region iii must end at the ideal coverages for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we are unable to confirm this for @xmath59 and @xmath60 because the area covered by the minority phase is too small .    </S>",
    "<S> to avoid fisher renormalization @xcite we investigate the order - disorder transition of the majority phases , @xmath6 and @xmath7 resp . </S>",
    "<S> , with glauber kinetics </S>",
    "<S> . paths of constant @xmath19 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ myphase ] . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath34 approaches @xmath57 the n - dependence of the finite - size peak in the specific heat @xmath61 deviates significantly from the potts values @xmath62 , resp .. for @xmath63 , label a , which corresponds to the ideal coverage @xmath8 , the exponent is @xmath64 , see above . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath65 we find @xmath66 ( label b ) and on the path @xmath67 we obtained @xmath68 ( label c ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath34 approaches @xmath57 from higher coverages @xmath69 increases from @xmath70 for @xmath71 , to @xmath72 for @xmath73 ( paths d - f ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior of @xmath69 is indicative of the existence of tricritical points on the order to disorder transition lines . in the interval between these tricritical points </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 , the transition is a fluctuation induced first order transition . while the coverage remains close to the ideal coverages @xmath22 resp . on lines of constant chemical potential which cross the phase boundary outside the interval @xmath75 , it changes rapidly on lines @xmath76 that cross the phase boundary within this interval . on these last lines the coverage develops large fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dt1 ] ) and ( [ dt2 ] ) where we plot @xmath36 versus @xmath77 . evidently , for @xmath78 the peaks in @xmath79 scale with a power of the system size . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , @xmath79 is structureless in the vicinity of the ideal coverages , where the transition is of second order . the insets in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dt1 ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dt2 ] display the jump in coverage on lines of constant @xmath19 and give an estimate of the width of regions i , ii in which the @xmath6 phase and the @xmath7 phase coexist with the lattice gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> from this point of view the maxima of the specific heat and of the susceptibilities obtained from simulations are to be considered as averages over these coexistence regions . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the tricritical points from finite size results is difficult since the exponents @xmath80 increase smoothly when @xmath34 is varied between the ideal coverages and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the tricritical points are the lower ( upper ) end points of the coexistence regions i and ii . we determine the boundaries of these coexistence regions by extrapolating the points of maximum curvature of the graphs @xmath81 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dt1 ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dt2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the estimate for the locations of the tricritical points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ myphase ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the two upper boundaries of the coexistence regions i , ii must meet the boundary of the coexistence region iii in one point , i.e. at @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the region iii would have a coexistence line with the lattice gas phase at which three phases coexist . </S>",
    "<S> this would contradict gibbs phase rule @xcite which , for a two component system with three phases , allows only for a triple point . </S>",
    "<S> this point is well known for binary alloys in 3d and is called _ eutectic point_. </S>",
    "<S> we check the first order nature of the phase transition at the eutectic point with simulations for constant @xmath34 . for symmetry reasons the chemical potential is constant on the line of constant coverage @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in contrast to the general case @xmath83 , calculations of critical exponents on this line are not affected by fisher renormalization @xcite . at the eutectic point </S>",
    "<S> our simulations yield the following size dependence of the specific heat and the susceptibilities : @xmath84 , @xmath85,@xmath86 . for first order transitions </S>",
    "<S> these thermodynamic quantities are predicted to diverge as @xmath87 with the system size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the discrepancy between this theoretical prediction and our numerical values for the exponents of the susceptibilities is visible in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ c - chi029 ] . while the positions of the peaks of the specific heat , @xmath88 , increase linearly with @xmath89 , the peaks of the susceptibilities , @xmath90 , curve upwards as function of @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that with our system sizes we have not yet reached the scaling regime . in fact , the data for @xmath91 and @xmath92 are based on effective system sizes @xmath93 because for @xmath57 the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 structures cover less than half the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have shown that the simple lattice gas model ( [ hamilton ] ) yields a surprisingly rich phase diagram in two dimensions which closely resembles phase diagrams commonly observed in three dimensional substitutional binary alloys . </S>",
    "<S> it accounts for all details of the experimental phase diagram in the coverage region @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the in particular coexistence regions i and ii . these regions and their structure could not be determined with certainty in the experiment although their existence had been inferred from the structure of the experimental phase diagram in the vicinity of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the topology of the phase diagram found in this study can be expected to occur more generally for systems with threefold symmetry provided the lateral interactions decrease with distance comparably fast as in our model . </S>"
