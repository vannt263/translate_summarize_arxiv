    "the efficient and accurate numerical approximation of high frequency wave propagation is of fundamental importance in many applications such as acoustic , electromagnetic , elasticity and geophysical surveys .",
    "when the problem is linear and time - harmonic , it can be typically modeled by helmholtz equation .",
    "the interest of this paper is to consider the helmholtz equation with robin boundary condition which is the first order approximation of the radiation condition : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a polygonal / polyhedral domain , @xmath2 is known as the wave number , @xmath3 denotes the imaginary unit , and @xmath4 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath5 .    for high wave number @xmath6 ,",
    "the linear system from the discretization of helmholtz equation is usually strongly indefinite , causing most of iterative methods to converge slowly or diverge . in recent years",
    ", there have been many advances in the development of iterative methods and preconditioners for the solution of the helmholtz equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    due to high efficiency of multilevel methods for positive definite problems , more and more attentions",
    "have been received to develop robust multilevel methods for helmholtz equation .",
    "however , a direct application of multilevel methods with standard smoothing and coarse grid correction are ineffective .",
    "some strategies have been proposed to remedy the problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for instance",
    ", elman , ernst and oleary @xcite proposed gmres smoothing together with flexible gmres acceleration .",
    "but in order to achieve convergence , a relatively large number of gmres smoothing steps are needed on the intermediate grids .",
    "another approach , the so - called wave - ray multigrid methods @xcite , was proposed by brandt and livshits through defining a meaningful coarse problem by augmenting the standard v - cycle with ray grids and using coarse grid basis derived from plane waves .",
    "this method performs well with increasing wave number , but it does not easily generalize to unstructured grids and complicated helmholtz problems . alternatively , instead of applying multigrid iterations directly to the helmholtz equation , a class of shifted laplacian preconditioners @xcite has recently attracted a lot of attention , which precondition the helmholtz equation with a complex shifted operator and is shown to be an efficient krylov method preconditioner .",
    "we would like to mention that engquist and ying @xcite recently proposed two new types of sweeping preconditioners for central difference scheme of the helmholtz equation based on an approximate @xmath7 factorization by sweeping the domain layer by layer starting from an absorbing layer .",
    "similar to the wave - ray multigrid methods , the new preconditioners have a nearly linear computational cost and the number of outer iterations is essentially independent of the number of unknowns and the wave number when combined with the gmres solver .",
    "our objective is to develop robust multilevel methods for the helmholtz problem ( [ hem])-([robin ] ) .",
    "although the pollution error is inherent in the standard finite element methods ( fem ) to solve helmholtz equation , the fem can still be used on fine grid whose mesh size is sufficiently small to reduce the pollution error . in a recent work @xcite , the pre - asymptotic analyses of both the fem and the continuous interior penalty finite element methods ( cip - fem ) are given .",
    "in particular , the well - posedness of standard fem has been proved under the condition of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is mesh size , @xmath10 is the polynomial order of approximation space , and @xmath11 is a constant independent of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , without this condition , the well - posedness of standard fem on coarse grids in the multilevel method can not be guaranteed .",
    "moreover , oscillations on the scale of the wavelength can not be resolved well by standard fem on the coarse grids . by contrast , the cip - fem has been proved in @xcite that the associated discrete problem is always well - posed without any mesh condition . intrinsically , the main technique in the stable cip - fem is to add a complex shift in the bilinear form , which is similar to the idea of shifted laplace preconditioner approach . comparing to adding a shift to the original problem in shifted laplace operator , the well - posed cip - fem is consistent with the original equation and only changes the discrete bilinear form .",
    "based on these observations , the new approach proposed in this work is to apply the cip - fem to construct the stable coarse grid correction problems .",
    "standard jacobi or gauss - seidel smoothers become unstable on the coarse grids , especially on the intermediate grids in multilevel methods .",
    "motivated by the smoothing approach presented in @xcite , the smoothing in this work is to use gmres method based on cip - fem on the coarse grids , and standard jacobi or gauss - seidel relaxation on the fine enough grids . from our numerical experiments ,",
    "we find that the number of gmres smoothing steps in our algorithm can be much smaller than that in @xcite , even if one gmres smoothing step may guarantee the optimal convergence of our multilevel algorithm .",
    "our main tool to analyze the multilevel methods for helmholtz equation is the _ local fourier analysis _",
    "( lfa ) , which has been introduced for multigrid analysis by achi brandt in 1977 @xcite .",
    "comprehensive surveys can be found in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we mainly utilize the lfa to analyze smoothing properties of relaxations and convergence properties of two- and three - level methods in one dimensional case .",
    "this may provide quantitative insights into the multilevel methods for helmholtz problem ( [ hem])-([robin ] ) .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ notation ] , we introduce some notation , recall the formulation of cip - fem , and present the multilevel method for the linear system from cip - fem approximation .",
    "section [ modified - multilevel ] is to present the modified multilevel method for helmholtz problem .",
    "standard fem is used on fine enough grids , on coarse grids the cip - fem is utilized instead .",

    "<S> in this paper we consider a class of robust multilevel precontioners for the helmholtz equation with high wave number . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea in this work is to use the continuous interior penalty finite element methods ( cip - fem ) studied in @xcite to construct the stable coarse grid correction problems . </S>",
    "<S> the multilevel methods , based on gmres smoothing on coarse grids , are then served as a preconditioner in the outer gmres iteration . in the one dimensional case , </S>",
    "<S> convergence property of the modified multilevel methods is analyzed by the local fourier analysis . from our numerical results , we find that the proposed methods are efficient for a reasonable range of frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the algorithms depends relatively mildly on wave number . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , only one gmres smoothing step may guarantee the optimal convergence of our multilevel algorithm , which remedies the shortcoming of the multilevel algorithm in @xcite </S>",
