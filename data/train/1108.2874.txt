    "the past few years have seen several interesting new results focusing on various aspects of the elusive  geometry over the field with one element \" , see for instance @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , @xcite , among many others .",
    "the idea of @xmath0-geometry has its roots in an observation of tits @xcite that limits as @xmath1 of counting functions for certain varieties defined over finite fields @xmath2 exhibit an interesting combinatorial meaning , suggesting that the resulting combinatorial geometry should be seen as an algebraic geometry over a non - existent  field with one element \" @xmath0 .",
    "part of the motivation for developing a sufficiently refined theory of varieties and schemes over @xmath0 lies in the idea that being able to cast @xmath3 in the role of a curve over a suitably defined @xmath4 may lead to finding an analog for number fields of the weil proof @xcite of the riemann hypothesis for finite fields .    among the existing approaches aimed at developing various aspects of geometry over @xmath0 , the one that is of direct interest to us in the present paper is a recent construction by connes and consani @xcite , @xcite of semirings of characteristic one ( a nilpotent hypothesis ) .",
    "these are endowed with an additive structure that provides an analog of the witt formula for the addition of the multiplicative teichmller lifts in strict @xmath5-rings . as observed in @xcite and @xcite , the commutativity , identity , and associativity conditions for this addition force the function used in defining the witt sums in characteristic one to be equal to the shannon entropy .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore this occurrence of the shannon entropy in the characteristic one witt construction of @xcite and @xcite . in particular , we show here that the construction introduced in those papers can be seen as part of a more general theory of  thermodynamic semirings \" , which encodes various properties of suitable  entropy functions \" in terms of algebraic properties of the corresponding semirings .    after reviewing the case of @xcite , @xcite in  [ prelimsec ] ,",
    "we present a general definition and some basic properties of thermodynamic semirings in  [ shaxiomsec ] and  [ thermosec ] , based on the axiomatization of information - theoretic entropy through the khinchin axioms and other equivalent formulations .",
    "we then give in  [ statmechsec ] a physical interpretation of the structure of thermodynamic semiring in terms of statistical mechanics , distinguishing between the extensive and non - extensive cases and the cases of ergodic and non - ergodic statistical systems .",
    "we see that the lack of associativity of the thermodynamic semiring has a natural physical interpretation in terms of mixing , chemical potentials , and free energy .",
    "this generalizes the thermodynamic interpretation of certain formulas from tropical mathematics considered in @xcite .",
    "we focus then on specific examples of other important information - theoretic entropy functions , such as the rnyi entropy , the tsallis entropy , or the kullback ",
    "leibler divergence , and we analyze in detail the properties of the corresponding thermodynamic semirings . in  [ renyisec ] , we consider the case of the rnyi entropy , which is a one - parameter generalization of the shannon entropy that still satisfies the extensivity property . in  [ tsallissec ] we focus instead on the tsallis entropy , which is a non - extensive one - parameter generalization of the shannon entropy , and we show that a simple one - parameter deformation of the witt construction of @xcite and @xcite identifies the tsallis entropy as the unique information measure that satisfies the associativity constraint .    in  [ klsec ] we consider the case of the kullback  leibler divergence or relative entropy ( information gain ) , and we show that thermodynamic semirings based on this information measure can be associated to univariate and multivariate binary statistical manifolds , in the sense of information geometry , and to multifractal systems , in such a way that the algebraic properties of the semirings detect the statistical and multifractal properties of the underlying spaces .",
    "we also relate a hyperfield structure arising from the kl divergence to those considered in @xcite .",
    "we also show in  [ assocsec ] that the algebraic structure of the thermodynamic semirings can be encoded in a suitably defined successor function and that the properties of this function and its iterates as a dynamical system capture both the algebraic structure of the semiring and the thermodynamical properties of the corresponding entropy measure .",
    "we give explicit examples of these successor functions and their behavior for the shannon , rnyi , and tsallis entropies . in ",
    "[ cumulsec ] we show that this function has an interpretation as the cumulant generating function for the energy , which reveals some futher thermodynamic details of our construction .",
    "finally , in  [ operadsec ] , we phrase our construction using operads whose composition trees suggest an interpretation in terms of  guessing games \" . exploring this ,",
    "we show that relations in a particular algebra ",
    "the thermodynamic semiring  for the guessing game operad correspond naturally to information theoretic properties of the entropy functions , cominiscent of an operadic characterization studied recently by baez , fritz and leinster , which we review .",
    "this allows us to rephrase connes and consani s original construction in a way that makes clear why the shannon entropy plays such a key role and provides a categorification of entropy functions .    in the last section we outline possible further directions",
    ", some of which will eventually relate back the general theory of thermodynamic semirings to the analogies between characteristic @xmath5 and characteristic one geometries .",
    "thus , this point of view based on thermodynamic semirings may be regarded as yet another possible viewpoint on @xmath0-geometry , based on information theory and statistical geometry , a sort of  cybernetic viewpoint \" .",
    "witt vectors were first proposed by ernst witt in 1936 to describe unramified extensions of the @xmath5-adic numbers . in particular",
    ", witt developed integral polynomial expressions for the arithmetic of strict @xmath5-rings in terms of their residue rings .",
    "a ring @xmath6 is a strict @xmath5-ring when @xmath6 is complete and hausdorff under the @xmath5-adic metric , @xmath5 is not a zero - divisor in @xmath6 , and the residue ring @xmath7 is perfect @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the ring @xmath6 is determined by @xmath8 up to canonical isomorphism , and there is a unique multiplicative section @xmath9 of the residue morphism @xmath10 , ie .",
    "@xmath11 every element @xmath12 of @xmath6 can be written uniquely as @xmath13 the @xmath14 are called teichmller representatives .    when @xmath15 , @xmath16 , but the teichmller representatives are not @xmath17 as they are in the common representation of @xmath18",
    ". instead they are the roots of @xmath19 .",
    "we see from this example that the arithmetic in terms of the teichmller representation above is nontrivial .",
    "the witt formula expresses the sum of these representatives as @xmath20 where @xmath21\\ , |\\ , p^n",

    "note that , since @xmath8 is perfect , the terms @xmath26 make sense .",
    "the idea of @xcite , @xcite is to generalize this to characteristic one by considering sums of the form @xmath27 where now @xmath28 $ ] over sufficiently nice characteristic one _ semi_rings .",
    "according to definition 2.7 of @xcite , a semiring is characteristic one when @xmath29 , i.e. when it is idempotent .",
    "for example , the tropical semifield , @xmath30 , with addition given by the sup and multiplication given by normal addition , forms a well studied characteristic one semiring in the context of tropical geometry @xcite , @xcite .    connes and consani found in @xcite , @xcite that , over a suitably nice characteristic one semiring , @xmath31 is commutative , associative , shares an identity with @xmath32 , and is order preserving _ if and only if _ @xmath33 is of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the well known shannon entropy @xmath37 where we write @xmath38 for the natural logarithm , and where @xmath39 is an arbitrary constant factor .    in this paper ,",
    "we attempt to elucidate this surprising connection between the algebraic structure of the semiring and the information theoretic entropy by developing a broader theory of thermodynamic semirings .",
    "we introduce here some basic facts that we will need to use in the rest of the paper .",
    "we start with a warning about notation . throughout most of the paper",
    "we will work implicitly with @xmath40 or @xmath41 in mind ( note the two are isomorphic under @xmath42 ) .",
    "as such , we will use the notation in one of the two .",
    "which one we use should hopefully be clear from the context .",
    "we do this because the first will give expressions looking more like statistical physics equations , and the second will give expressions more similar to the witt construction in characteristic @xmath5 .",
    "we will tend to write @xmath43 ( perhaps with other relevant subscripts ) for the witt addition , to indicate that it is a modification of the _ additive _ structure of the semiring , and that it depends on the choice of a binary information measure ( or entropy ) @xmath44 and of a temperature parameter @xmath45 .",
    "this is motivated by tropical geometry , where it is customary to denote by @xmath46 the addition in the tropical semiring , ie .",
    "the minimum , and by @xmath47 the multiplication , the usual addition @xmath32 , see @xcite .",
    "we recall here , from @xcite , @xcite , the behavior of the frobenius action in the characteristic one setting .",
    "let @xmath8 be a commutative , characteristic one semifield .",
    "it is possible to work in the slightly more general case of multiplicatively cancellative semirings , but for simplicity we will forsake this generality . recall that such a semifield is a set with two associative , commutative binary operations , @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that the second distributes over the first , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath8 has multiplicative inverses , and , importantly , the characteristic one condition that @xmath29 .",
    "the first step in developing an analog of the witt construction is to examine the frobenius map in @xmath8 .",
    "[ onefrob ] ( frobenius ) @xmath53    the proof is given in lemma 4.3 of @xcite , but we recall it here for the convenience of the readers .",
    "one sees from the distributive property that , for every @xmath54 , one has @xmath55 .",
    "this then gives @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath8 is multiplicatively cancellative , this implies .      as shown in lemma 4.2 of @xcite , @xmath8 is endowed with a natural partial ordering @xmath57 defined so that @xmath58 .",
    "this may seem strange , but one sees that , over the tropical semifield , @xmath59 this reads @xmath60 .",
    "we give @xmath8 the order topology from @xmath57 .",
    "then multiplication and the frobenius automorphisms make @xmath8 a topological @xmath61-module , since the frobenius is continuous and distributes over the multiplicative structure . when @xmath62 , this topology is the standard one on @xmath63 , with the frobenius acting by multiplication so that @xmath8 has the normal vector space structure .",
    "we say that a function @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a convex subset of a topological @xmath61-module , is convex if , for every @xmath66 $ ] , @xmath67 , @xmath68 with concavity being defined as convexity of the multiplicative inverse of @xmath69 .",
    "note again that , over @xmath59 , this is the normal definition of convexity .",
    "we consider also @xmath70 called the _ epigraph _ of @xmath69 .",
    "this has the following property .",
    "[ epilem ] a function @xmath69 is convex iff the epigraph @xmath71 is convex and @xmath69 is closed iff @xmath71 is closed .",
    "the topological @xmath61-module structure on @xmath72 is given by the product structure , so the proof follows directly from the definitions .",
    "when @xmath73 , we can define the legendre transform of @xmath69 by @xmath74 note that over @xmath59 this reads @xmath75 which is the normal definition of the legendre transform .",
    "when @xmath76 , we can define the legendre transform of @xmath69 by @xmath77    [ proplegendre ] the legendre transform of @xmath69 is closed and convex .",
    "suppose first @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 , and @xmath80 be the legendre transform of @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath80 is the point - wise supremum among the @xmath81 , so @xmath82 , an intersection of closed half spaces .",
    "thus , @xmath83 is closed and convex , so @xmath80 is closed and convex , by the lemma [ epilem ] .",
    "the proof of the opposite case proceeds in precisely the same manner .",
    "one then has the following result on legendre transforms .",
    "[ thmlegendre ] ( fenchel - moreau ) let @xmath84 , @xmath78 . then the following hold",

    "2 .   @xmath86 iff @xmath69 is closed and convex .",
    "the function @xmath85 is convex and closed by lemma [ epilem ] .",
    "we also see that @xmath87 so taking a @xmath88 of both sides yields @xmath89 . to prove the second fact , it suffices to show that , if @xmath69 is closed , convex , and finite , then @xmath90 .",
    "define the subdifferential @xmath91 of @xmath69 at @xmath92 by @xmath93 we consider the set - valued map @xmath94 . to invert",

    "then we have @xmath99 for every @xmath92 , proving the theorem .",
    "this is a simple translation of the well - known legendre transform machinery into characteristic one semirings .",
    "the idea is that since we can define a real topological vector space structure on @xmath8 using the multiplication as addition and the frobenius map as scalar multiplication ( with negative reals having a well - defined action since @xmath8 has multiplicative inverses ) , we have enough structure to do convex analysis .",
    "the point is that for concave or convex @xmath69 , the above sums are invertible in @xmath8 . from now on ,",

    "this is just another way of writing @xmath601 as a composition of trees , and puts the recursion into the second term rather than the first in .",
    "because of this recursion , every internal @xmath764-algebra of @xmath61 is determined by the sequence @xmath813 ( by the third condition above , implicity @xmath814 ) .    when @xmath815 and we use @xmath816 , the shannon entropy , then @xmath817 , so the above becomes @xmath818",
    "we sketch here some possible further directions where the notion of thermodynamic semirings may prove useful .",
    "information geometry was developed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as a way to encode , using methods based on riemannian geometry , statistical information , such as how to infer unobserved variables on the basis of observed ones by reducing conditional joint probabilities to marginal distributions .",
    "one - dimensional e - flat or m - flat manifolds are called e - geodesics and m - geodesics . in information geometry ,",
    "maximum posterior marginal optimization is achieved by finding the point on an e - flat submanifold @xmath824 that minimizes the kl divergence , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the point on an e - flat submanifold @xmath824 that minimizes the kl divergence also minimizes the riemannian metric given by the fisher information metric .",
    "more precisely , when considering the kl divergences @xmath411 , where @xmath408 varies in an e - flat submanifold @xmath824 of the given information manifold @xmath332 , there is a unique point @xmath408 in @xmath824 that minimizes @xmath411 and it is given by the point where the m - geodesic from @xmath5 meets @xmath824 orthogonally with respect to the fisher information metric ( see theorem 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , from the point of view of information geometry , it seems especially interesting to look at cases of the thermodynamic semiring structures @xmath828 for distributions @xmath408 that vary along e - flat submanifolds of information manifolds and recast some riemannian aspects of information geometry in terms of algebraic properties of the thermodynamic semirings .",
    "most of our results have a very natural thermodynamic interpretation when written explicitly in the case of the tropical semifield ( seen as a prototype example of characteristic one semiring as in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , besides the original motivation arising in the context of @xmath0 geometry , it is possible that the theory of thermodynamic semirings we developed here may have some interesting applications in the setting of tropical geometry @xcite .",
    "the use of tropical geometry in the context of probabilistic inference in statistical models was recently advocated in @xcite . in that approach",
    "one considers polynomial maps from a space of parameters to the space of joint probability distributions on a set of random variables .",
    "these give statistical models described by algebraic varieties .",
    "the tropicalization of the resulting algebraic variety is then used as a model for parametric inference , for instance , by interpreting marginal probabilities as coordinates of points on the variety .",
    "it would therefore seem interesting to extend the encoding of thermodynamic and information - theoretic properties into the additive structure of the semiring to the broader context of tropical varieties .",
    "in particular one can consider the patchworking process , where operations are peformed on the `` quantized '' varieties , and then the limit in the maslov dequantization , corresponding to the residue morphism @xmath829 , is performed , obtaining the new tropical variety .",
    "observe , for instance , that in the usual setting of tropical geometry , in passing from an algebraic variety to its tropicalization , starting with a polynomial @xmath69 defining a hypersurface @xmath694 in @xmath830 , one can proceed by first considering an associated maslov dequantization , given by a one - parameter family @xmath831 , whose zero set one denotes by @xmath832 .",
    "one then considers the amoeba obtained by mappint @xmath832 to @xmath336 under the map @xmath833 .",
    "one obtains in this way the amoeba @xmath834 .",
    "as we send the parameter @xmath835 , the subsets @xmath836 converge in the hausdorff metric to the tropical variety @xmath837 , see @xcite .",
    "for example , for a polynomial of the form @xmath838 , one obtains @xmath839 by passing to @xmath840 and @xmath841 , so that one can then replace @xmath842 by the deformed @xmath843 , which in turn defines the dequantized family @xmath839 .    by comparing with proposition [ propshsum ]",
    ", one can see that the maslov dequantization can be expressed in terms of the operation @xmath844 , where the dequantization parameter @xmath238 plays the role of the temperature @xmath45 , as also observed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can introduce variants of the maslov dequantization procedure , based on other operations @xmath43 , for other choice of information measures .",
    "in particular , one can consider dequantizations based on various @xmath161-ary information measures of the form @xmath845 with the data labelled by trees @xmath601 , as we described in  [ operadsec ] above .    while one can expect that the tropical limit itself will be independent of the use of different information measures in the dequantization procedure",
    ", operations performed at the level of the amoebas @xmath846 will likely have variants with different properties when the shannon entropy is replaced by other information measures of the kind considered in this paper .      in the characteristic @xmath5 case",
    ", the functoriality of the witt construction provides a way to construct extensions of the field of @xmath5-adic numers @xmath848 using the fact that @xmath849 , and applying the same witt functor to extensions @xmath2 .",
    "this gives @xmath850 $ ] , which is the valuation ring of an unramified extension @xmath851 of @xmath852 , see @xcite .",
    "it was observed in  7 of @xcite that , in the case of the chracteristic one version of the witt construction , when one considers the @xmath844 simultaneously for all possible temperatures @xmath45 , one can describe a candidate analog of  unramified extension \" @xmath847 in terms of analogs of teichmller characters given in the form @xmath853 and an analog of the residue morphism of the form @xmath854 .",
    "we see that this is a result of the general form of the temperature dependence in the current context . in symbols",
    ", we are looking for @xmath856@xmath857 where the residue morphism forces @xmath858 for some invertible @xmath69 , depending on @xmath859 .",
    "we see from the above that @xmath860 , proving the claim .",
    "this forces the characters to have the same form as in the shannon entropy case , ie .",
    "however , these characters are additive only if @xmath862 , which means @xmath44 must produce the same thermodynamic structure as the shannon entropy , hence , by a theorem above , @xmath44 is the shannon entropy .",
    "note that this analysis holds also in the @xmath263-deformed witt construction leading to the tsallis entropy discussed in ",
    "[ witttsallissec ] .",
    "if we pass to the field of fractions of these characters , and consider further infinite sums of these characters , the resulting expressions begin to resemble partition functions in the euclidean path integral formulation , see  7 in @xcite .",
    "indeed , if one uses instead @xmath863 , these are equal to equilibrium free energies of the type observed in  [ thermosec ] . the failure of the additivity of the characters in @xmath864 can thus be interpreted in terms of nonextensivity .",
    "this suggests that , as this candidate for @xmath864 is investigated , new algebraic interpretations of nonextensivity will arise .",
    "it would also be interesting to see if a notion of character which is additive on the @xmath263-deformed witt construction could give rise to a one - parameter family of @xmath864 s .      the main motivation for the witt construction in characteristic one given in @xcite and @xcite , which provides the prototype example of a thermodynamic semiring built on the shannon entropy , is to provide an analog in characteristic one of the formulae for the summation of teichmller representatives in the case of multiplicative lifts to @xmath865 of the characteristic @xmath5 elements in @xmath866 .",
    "one can then reverse the point of view and start from the more general thermodynamic semirings associated to other forms of entropy , such as rnyi , tsallis , kullback ",
    "leibler , with their axiomatic characterizations , and look for characteristic @xmath5 analogs of non - extensive thermodynamics and other such variants of statistical physics .",
    "for instance , we saw in ",
    "[ tsallissec ] above that there is a one - parameter deformation of the witt construction in characteristic one , which yields a characterization of the tsallis entropy @xmath867 as the unique binary information measure that satisfies the associativity , commutativity and unity constraints for this deformed @xmath300 operation .",
    "one thinks of the original @xmath844 with the shannon entropy as in @xcite and @xcite , as being the correct analog in characteristic one of the @xmath5-adic witt construction @xmath868 with @xmath869 the set of rational numbers in @xmath870 $ ] with denominator a power of @xmath5 and @xmath871 where the @xmath872 , for @xmath873 are determined by the addition of teichmller representatives @xmath874    thus , one can equivalently think of the universal sequence of the @xmath875 as being the characteristic @xmath5 analog of the shannon information . adopting this viewpoint",
    ", one would then expect that the one - parameter deformation of the witt construction in characteristic one described in ",
    "[ tsallissec ] , which leads naturally from the shannon entropy to the non - extensive tsallis entropy , may correspond to an analogous deformation of the original @xmath5-adic witt construction that leads to a notion of non - extensive entropy and non - ergodic thermodynamics in characteristic @xmath5 .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are in fact interesting known @xmath263-deformations of the witt constructions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "these can naturally be described within the setting of @xmath876-rings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this seems especially useful , in view of the whole approach to @xmath0 geometry based on @xmath876-rings , developed by james borger in @xcite and @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite for other related viewpoints ) .",
    "however , a reader familiar with the positive characteristic witt construction will notice that connes and consani s construction generalize the @xmath5-witt ring from a rather unconventional expression for its addition .",
    "this is difficult to translate into the @xmath876-ring approach to the witt ring .",
    "a definition of @xmath876-rings in characteristic one which reproduces the witt rings considered in this paper would likely be interesting both geometrically and physically .",
    "this also suggests that identifying suitable analogs of other entropy functions ( tsallis , rnyi , kullback ",
    "leibler ) in characteristic @xmath5 , via deformations of the ring of witt vectors , may also further our understanding of @xmath0-geometry in the @xmath876-ring approach .",
