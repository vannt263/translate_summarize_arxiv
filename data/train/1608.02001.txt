    "among all extrasolar planets , those that are transiting are recognised as the most interesting to study in detail .",
    "the fact that they periodically transit their parent stars makes it possible to measure their physical and orbital parameters with exquisite precision by means of standard astronomical techniques .",
    "these measurements can also include their spin - orbit alignment ( i.e. the sky - projected angle between planetary orbital axis and stellar spin , @xmath3 ) , their thermal flux and reflected light , and the chemical composition of their atmosphere .",
    "these parameters are precious for theoretical astrophysicists seeking to understand the general mechanisms that rule planetary formation and evolution .",
    "we are contributing to this cause by carrying out a large programme using an array of medium - class telescopes to perform photometric follow - up of the transits of known exoplanets .",
    "the main aim of our programme is to collect high - quality transit light curves that we use to refine measurements of the physical parameters of the corresponding planetary systems in a homogeneous way @xcite .    during a transit event ,",
    "the planet acts as an opaque mask which ` scans ' a stripe of the parent star s photosphere . in the case of hot jupiters , which have a relatively large size , transiting main - sequence stars similar to the sun",
    ", this scanning can reveal star - spots .",
    "these regions are recorded as small ` bumps ' in the transit light curve and provide additional information about the stellar activity and planetary orbit .",
    "high - precision , low - scatter and unbinned light curves are needed to catch these bumps , whose amplitude is colour - dependent .",
    "thanks to observations of planetary transits , star - spots have been now detected and characterised in many circumstances @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the transiting planetary system wasp-52 @xcite .",
    "this is composed of a low - density , inflated hot jupiter , wasp-52b ( mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 ) , which orbits a k2v star , wasp-52a , every 1.75d .",
    "@xcite observed emission cores in the caii h+k lines of the wasp-52 spectra , which indicate that the star is active .",
    "they also estimated its rotational period , @xmath6d , and a gyrochronological age of @xmath7gyr , which suggests that the star is quite young , even though no lithium was detected in its spectra .",
    "they also spectroscopically observed a transit , detected the rossiter - mclaughlin effect and measured the sky - projected orbital obliquity to be @xmath8 .",
    "since the star is active , it may be possible to detect star - spots during transits , and we have done so .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the photometric follow - up observations and data reduction are described in sect.[sec_2 ] .",
    "the analysis of the light curves is presented in sect.[sec_3 ] . in sect.[sec_4 ] , we revise the main physical properties of the planetary system . in sect.[sec_5 ] , we investigate the variation of the planetary radius as function of wavelength and , finally , we summarise our results in sect.[sec_6 ] .",
    "the planetary system wasp-52 is near the celestial equator so can be observed from both hemispheres . in 2013 and 2014",
    "we monitored eight ( seven complete and one partial ) transits of wasp-52b in several optical passbands ( covering @xmath9 nm ) , using four different telescopes ( table[tab : obs ] ) and obtaining a total of 13 light curves .",
    "five of the transits show anomalies that are compatible with the presence of occulted star - spots on the photosphere of the parent star ( see figs[fig : lc_01 ] and [ fig : lc_02 ] ) .",
    "we can actually exclude that the anomalies on the light curves are caused by plages because plages do not resize in the photosphere , but in the chromosphere .",
    "actually , using a telescope working in the optical , we can only see stellar light coming from the photosphere , except for a small amount of light in the h and k lines at 3933.7 and 3968.5 , h@xmath10 at 6562.8 , and a few other lines .",
    "that means that if wasp-52b occulted a plage , we would have to observe anomalies only in the @xmath11 band , i.e. the gamma - ray burst optical and near - infrared detector ( grond ) bluest band ( see sect.[sec_2.4 ] ) , as in the case of hats-2 @xcite .",
    "we can also exclude that the anomalies on the light curves are caused by bright spots ( i.e. faculae ) because of the transit depth : the data points that were not affected by star - spots are at the right transit depth ; on the contrary , if we consider that the planet occulted hot spots , then the data points that were not affected by them are at the wrong transit depth .",
    "moreover , faculae are mostly seen at the solar limb , not in the disc centre .",
    "so , also their effect to the transit light curves should be negligible , except maybe close to the limb , but this is not the case .    the transit on 2013/09/14 was simultaneously followed by two telescopes at different observing sites ( fig.[fig : lc_01 ] , second panel ) .",
    "the complete transit was observed from italy , and part was also observed from spain on a cloudy night .",
    "interestingly , the same anomalous feature is seen in both light curves , demonstrating the power of the two - site observational strategy in differentiating true astrophysical signal from systematic noise @xcite .",
    "the transit on 2014/07/24 was also simultaneously observed using two telescopes , located on the same site in the southern hemisphere ( fig.[fig : lc_02 ] , first panel ) .",
    "also in this case , one telescope monitored the entire transit but the other telescope missed half of it , due to a failure of the telescope control system .",
    "also in this case , an anomaly was recorded by both telescopes .",
    "observations were all performed by _ defocussing _ the telescopes , in order to increase the photometric precision @xcite , and using autoguiding . in all cases except the mpg 2.2 m telescope ,",
    "the ccds were windowed to decrease the readout time and therefore increase the cadence of the observations .",

    "were estimated using the codes mentioned above and placed on the bjd(tdb ) time system .",
    "we only considered timings based on complete light curves and taken with professional telescopes .",
    "a series of very scattered points at the egress phase were excluded from the fts 2.0 m light curve , but this did not compromise the precision of @xmath25 achieved for this data set .",
    "the reference epoch was chosen as that corresponding to our best light curve , based on the _ rms _ scatter of the data ( see table[tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the timings were fitted with a straight line to obtain : @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the number of orbital cycles after the reference epoch , and the quantities in brackets are the uncertainties in the two final digits of the preceding number .",
    "all transit times and their residual versus the fitted ephemeris are reported in table[tab : wasp52oc ] .",
    "the residuals are also plotted in the top panel of fig.[fig : oc ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath28 of the fit is simply the chi - squared divided by the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of observations , and @xmath31 is the number of fitted parameters .",
    "] is quite high , @xmath32 , suggesting that the linear ephemeris does not give a good match to the observations .",
    "the uncertainties given above have been inflated to account for this by multiplying them by @xmath33 .",
    "we then added more timings to our sample , taken from the etd archive .",
    "we selected light curves having a complete transit coverage and a data quality index @xmath34 . adding these nine timings to the sample",
    ", we repeated the analysis , obtaining a worse @xmath35 of @xmath36 .",
    "the new residuals are shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : oc ] .",
    "this suggests that the orbital period of wasp-52b is not constant , and that transit timing variations ( ttvs ) occur due to the presence of additional bodies in the system .",
    "however , based on our extensive experience in such kind of analysis , an excess @xmath35 is often caused by underestimation of the uncertainty of the measurements , which have been collected using multiple telescopes , instruments and time sources .",
    "the presence of star - spots can also cause an excess @xmath35 @xcite . actually , a lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram of the timing residuals does not reveal a significant periodic variation .",
    "moreover , the timing measurements are often separated by hundreds of days so are insensitive to many periodicities .",
    "the systematic observation of many subsequent transits , preferably performed with the same telescope , would be the only way to claim a ttv with a high level of confidence .",
    "as described above , the anomalies in some of our light curves were modelled as star - spots using the prism+gemc codes ( see tables [ table : fits ] and [ table : fits2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the star - spot parameters obtained from the fit of the light curves observed simultaneously with two different telescopes on 2014/07/24 are physically consistent to each other within the uncertainties .",
    "fig.[fig : sketches ] shows representations of the projected stellar surface with the spots and the transit chord .",
    "we note that four star - spots , of similar size , were detected in four transit events observed over 43d in 2014 july - september .",
    "since star - spots have lower temperatures in comparison to stellar photosphere , we used the blackbody approximation and applied equation 1 of @xcite @xmath37 to estimate the temperatures of the star - spots based on their contrast ( table[table : fits2 ] ) , the frequency @xmath38 , and on the effective temperature of wasp-52a , @xmath39k @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 is the planck constant and @xmath41 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the temperatures are reported in table[table : fits2 ] and agree well with each other .",
    "this can be also seen in fig.[fig : spotcontrast ] , in which we compare the star - spot contrasts calculated by prism+gemc with those expected for a star - spot at 4650k over a stellar photosphere of 5000k , both modelled with atlas9 model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "we then considered the three star - spots detected between 2014 july and august with the danish telescope through the same filter ( bessel @xmath42 ) , and estimated a weighted mean star - spot temperature , @xmath43k .",
    "fig.[fig : star - spot_contrast ] compares this value with those measured for other main - sequence dwarf stars .",
    "this plot tells us that , in the case of dwarf stars , the temperature difference between the photosphere and star - spots does not seem to be correlated with spectral class .",
    "this is contrary to the trend in star - spot temperature contrasts with spectral type found by various authors , see e.g. @xcite .      over a 43d time interval ,",
    "we have observed star - spot features in four transits of wasp-52b , three with the danish 1.54 m telescope and one with the ca 1.23 m telescope .",
    "we label these transits as @xmath44 ( see table[table : fits ] and fig.[fig : fit_01 ] ) .",
    "the time intervals between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are 14d , whereas that between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is 15d .",
    "it is worth considering if these events are due to the same star - spot , or star - spot complex , being occulted during each transit .",
    "indeed , due to differential rotation , a large star - spot , which covers a broad latitudinal range , could possibly break into smaller spots with shorter lifetimes .",
    "first , we note that the four star - spots are located at roughly the same co - latitude and have the same angular radius within the uncertainties ( table[table : fits2 ] ) . considering @xmath45 ,",
    "the angular size of the star - spot corresponds to a radius of @xmath49 km . knowing the size",
    ", we can estimate the lifetime of the star - spot by applying the g - w empirical relation @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the maximum size of the star - spot in units of micro solar hemispheres ( msh ) and @xmath52 is the star - spot lifetime .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 was estimated to be @xmath54mshd@xmath55 for individual sunspots @xcite . using the g - w relationship",
    ", we estimated a lifetime of 11.7 months for the star - spot corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    "however , this relation was doubted by @xcite , who argued that it returns star - spot lifetimes that are overestimated by at least two orders of magnitude , and suggested an alternative relation , based on turbulent magnetic diffusivity operating at the supergranule scale .",
    "this new relation lowers the lifetime of the star - spot in transit @xmath45 to 70d for a supergranule size of @xmath56 km , which corresponds to 0.1@xmath57 .",
    "even this shorter lifetime means that the star - spot detected in @xmath45 should have lasted sufficiently long to reappear in the three subsequent transit events that we recorded .      in general ,",
    "the occultation of the same star - spot complex in two or more transit events is a clear indicator that there is a good alignment between the planet s orbital axis and its host star s spin .",
    "this allows the measurement of the sky - projected spin - orbit angle , @xmath3 , with higher precision than can normally be obtained from the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the contrary , if we have observed two different star - spots , their latitude difference is completely degenerate with @xmath3 .",
    "discriminating the two cases is not trivial .",
    "crucial parameters to take into account are the rotational period of the parent star , @xmath58 , and the difference in position and time between the star - spots .",
    "if we monitor many transits of the same planet and have observed the same star - spot in two different transit events , then the distance @xmath59 covered by the star - spot , with respect to a terrestrial observer , in the time between the two detections , is given by @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath31 is the number of revolutions completed by the star , @xmath61 is the scaled stellar radius for the latitude at which the star - spot has been observed and @xmath62 is the arc length on the stellar photosphere between the two positions of the star - spot . using this equation , we can calculate the rotational velocity of the star at the star - spot latitude and compare it with that measured with other techniques ( for example by modelling a periodic photometric modulation in the light curve induced by a star - spot activity ) .",
    "this will tell us if the same star - spot may have been observed after consecutive transits or after some orbital cycles , presuming that in the latter case the star has performed one or more complete revolutions .",
    "a proper modelling and accurate analysis of the size , contrast and position of two star - spots , detected in two very close transit events , can therefore reveal that we are actually dealing with the same star - spot ( e.g.  see the case of wasp-19 discussed by @xcite ) .    in our case",
    ", we are dealing with wasp-52a , whose rotational velocity was estimated to be @xmath6d @xcite . based on the measurement of @xmath3 by @xcite , we can exclude that wasp-52b is moving on a retrograde orbit .",
    "we have detected four star - spots in four different transits , in a timespan of 43d , which is consistent with the lifetime of a large star - spot ( see sect.[sec_3.2.2 ] ) .",
    "for the case @xmath63 , the star would rotate unrealistically slowly . instead",
    ", the case @xmath64 is very reasonable since it implies a rotational period of the star of @xmath65d at co - latitude of @xmath66 if we consider the star - spots detected in @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this value is consistent with those coming from considering the star - spots detected in @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and in @xmath69 and @xmath70 , i.e.  @xmath71d at co - latitude of @xmath72 and @xmath73d at a co - latitude of @xmath74 , respectively . under the assumption",
    "that we have detected the same star - spot , we can simply estimate the sky - projected angle between the stellar rotation and the planetary orbit to be @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 for the cases @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , respectively . by taking the weighed mean of these values ,",
    "we obtain @xmath0 , which is consistent with zero .",
    "there is a roughly @xmath81 disagreement between our measurement of @xmath3 and that from ( @xcite , @xmath8 ) .",
    "even though our result supports a very low spin - orbit misalignment , the two measurements are quite compatible .",
    "the detection of the same star - spot in three or more transits can in principle allow the true , rather than sky - projected , orbital alignment to be found ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in the current case we have four position measurements for one star - spot , although two are at very similar longitudes so are effectively one measurement .",
    "we fitted the four positions of the spot using a coordinate transformation between the intrinsic stellar surface and the projected surface as seen from earth .",
    "seven parameters ( the four intrinsic longitudes of the spot , the single latitude of the spot , and the obliquity and rotation between the two coordinate systems ) were fitted to eight measured quantities ( the projected latitude and longitude of the spot during each of the four transits ) , and uncertainties determined using a simple monte carlo method .",
    "we found the true orbital obliquity to be @xmath82 and conclude that the available measurements are insufficient to put a strong constraint on this quantity .",
    "the spot positions are consistent with an aligned orbit , and are not consistent with a pole - on configuration .",
    "better results could be obtained if star - spot positions could be measured at a wider range of longitudes and with increased precision in the measured latitudes , a situation which likely requires space - based data .",
    "@xmath2 can be also constrained by estimating the stellar spin inclination angle , @xmath83 , knowing the rotational period of the parent star , that is @xmath84 where we used @xmath85kms@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "since values @xmath86 are unphysical , @xmath83 must have a value between 1 and 0.73 , i.e. between @xmath87 and @xmath88 . then , using equation ( 7 ) from @xcite , @xmath89 we estimated that @xmath90 is comprised between @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which is in agreement with our previous measurement and also excludes that wasp-52a is in a pole - on configuration .",
    "we used the _ homogeneous studies _ ( hstep ) approach ( see @xcite and references therein ) for revising the main physical properties of the wasp-52 planetary system",
    ". first of all , we established an input set of parameters , composed of :    * @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , which were measured from the photometric light curves ( this work ; see sect.[sec_3 ] ) ; * @xmath97 and [ fe / h]@xmath98 measured from the spectroscopic analysis @xcite ; * the velocity amplitude of the star , @xmath99ms@xmath55 , measured from the radial velocities @xcite .",
    "the orbital eccentricity was fixed to zero .",
    "we started the analysis by estimating the radial ",
    "velocity amplitude of the planet , @xmath100 , and determining an initial set of the physical parameters of the system , in particular the stellar mass . using various tables of stellar parameters predicted by different theoretical models ( i.e. claret @xcite ; y@xmath101 @xcite ; dsep @xcite ; vrss @xcite ; basti @xcite ) , we then interpolated to find the stellar radius and @xmath102 for our provisional mass and the observed [ fe / h ] , over all possible ages for the star .",
    "after that , we adjusted @xmath100 in an iterative way , with the aim to maximise the agreement between the measured values of @xmath103 and @xmath102 and those predicted by one of the sets of theoretical models .",
    "we ended with a set of five values for each output quantity and we considered the unweighted mean of these as the final value .",
    "they are shown in table[tab : finalparameters ] .",
    "finally , we assigned two uncertainties for each of the final values : a systematic error based on the level of agreement among the values obtained using different theoretical models , and a statistical error related to the propagation of the uncertainties of the input parameters .",
    "two parameters , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , have no systematic error , as they can be directly estimated from observable quantities .",
    "almost all of our results , reported in table[tab : finalparameters ] , are in good agreement with those found by @xcite .",
    "we found a slightly lower value for the stellar mass , but the two estimates are compatible within their uncertainties .",
    "however , the stellar age estimates are completely different .",
    "this fact is not a surprise as the two values were obtained using different procedures : our estimate is based on theoretical models ( isochronal age , @xmath106 ) , while that of @xcite comes from the star s rotation period ( gyrochronological age , @xmath107 ) .",
    "it is well known that for many planetary systems , composed by a main - sequence star and a hot jupiter , the gyrochronological age is significantly lower than the isochronal age ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.[fig : age ] , where the two estimates for wasp-52 are plotted versus each other , together with those taken from the sample analysed by @xcite .",
    "more than intrinsic stellar characteristics ( like temperature or metallicity ) , the discrepancy is reasonably attributable to the star ",
    "planet tidal interactions in some cases ; tides are actually able to transfer angular momentum from the orbit of a hot jupiter to the rotation of the parent star , which are thus ` spun up ' and forced to rotate faster .",
    "however , stellar activity can also play an important role for explaining this phenomenology . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath108 discrepancy is particularly evident for k - type stars , like wasp-52 , and some g stars .",
    "the k stars suffer a ` radius anomaly ' ( their size appears to be larger than predicted by standard stellar models ; e.g. @xcite ) , which is correlated with their rotation rate .",
    "the increase of the rotational velocity is , in turn , directly proportional to the amount of magnetic activity .",
    "a large number of star - spots can inhibit the efficiency of energy transport by convection , and affect the physical characteristics of the photosphere and the star s rotation rate .",
    "that said , the age of wasp-52 estimated by gyrochronology @xcite could be underestimated due to the presence of the close giant planet and the magnetic activity of the star , which causes it to rotate faster . on the other hand ,",
    "the star is clearly quite active and this suggests a young age , in contrast with the isochronal age that we have estimated .",
    "this situation is not easy to clarify and requires more sophisticated models .",

    "we stress that this result is not significant and is based on light curves taken with different instruments and at different times . moreover , unocculted star - spots can cause variations of the transit depth , which are dependent on wavelength and the amount of stellar activity at particular cycles .",
    "these variations can be particularly stronger at bluer wavelengths .",
    "we estimated the effect of unocculted star - spots on the transmission spectrum of wasp-52b using the methodology described by @xcite .",

    "in this work we reported photometric observations of eight transit events of wasp-52b , performed using four different medium - class telescopes , located on both of earth s hemispheres , through different optical passbands .",
    "all of the transits were observed using the _ defocussing _ technique , achieving a photometric precision of @xmath172mmag per observation .",

    "the only exception is the age of the system , which is very discordant .",
    "such a discrepancy can be explained because of the different methods used in the two analyses : we reported an age based on theoretical models , while @xcite used gyrochronology .",
    "the isochronal age is not compatible with the activity of the star , but the gyrochronological age could be severely underestimated , as the presence of the close - in hot jupiter and , again , stellar activity were not taken into account @xcite .",
    "this case is emblematic of the limits of the techniques currently used to estimate stellar ages .",
    "+ * we carefully characterised the star - spots detected in various transits .",
    "our best - fitting models yield measurements of their positions on the stellar disc , and their size and contrast . from these we extracted their temperature and speculate about the alignment between the planet s orbital axis and the stellar spin . * * we estimated the star - spot temperature contrast for wasp-52 and compare it with those derived from ( @xmath95 ) the light curves of other transiting planetary systems and ( @xmath173 ) via other techniques . joining the various data sets in a global picture , the dependence of the starpot temperature contrast with the spectral class is not anymore evident as in the case in which the data from transits were not considered , see fig.[fig : spot_contrast_2 ] .",
    "+ [ -8pt ] * * we found a sky - projected orbital obliquity of @xmath174 , which is consistent with and more precise than the value found from the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite . using the four positions measured for the same star - spot , we were able to place a weak constraint on the true orbital obliquity : @xmath82 .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first measurement of @xmath2 based on only star - spot crossings . *",
    "since our transits were recorded through different filters at optical wavelengths , we attempted to reconstruct an optical transmission spectrum of the planet .",
    "we found a small variation , @xmath175 , of the planet s radius , but at a low significance .",
    "we conclude that the transmission spectrum of wasp-52 is flat to within the experimental errors .",
    "however , more precise and simultaneous multi - band observations are suggested to robustly confirm our finding .    ) , while dotted line is the linear fit to all the points ( pearson linear correlation coefficient @xmath176 ) . ]",
