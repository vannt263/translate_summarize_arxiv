    "an important and still open issue , at present under considerable discussion , of the high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) is the role that play in their superconducting phase transition the chemical and electronic disorder and inhomogeneities,@xcite and the loss of long - range phase coherence due to vortex fluctuations.@xcite the ongoing debate , whose elucidation may be an appreciable step toward the understanding of the pairing mechanism in htsc , is particularly well illustrated by the _ precursor _ diamagnetism observed above the meissner transition . in optimally",
    "doped htsc , this effect was first studied quantitatively by lee , klemm and johnston @xcite and attributed , as in the case of the conventional ( bcs ) low-@xmath3 superconductors,@xcite to the presence of evanescent cooper pairs created by the unavoidable thermal agitation .",
    "this last conclusion was supported by the fact that the measured diamagnetism could be accounted for in terms of the ginzburg - landau approach for multilayered superconductors with gaussian fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter ( ggl approach ) . since then",
    ", the applicability of this _ conventional _ phenomenological ggl scenario , which was more recently extended empirically to high reduced temperatures by the introduction of a _ total energy _",
    "cutoff,@xcite has been confirmed by different groups in many htsc,@xcite very in particular in underdoped compounds up to relatively high reduced field amplitudes , of the order of 0.2.@xcite further support was earlier provided by the consistency with other intrinsic rounding effects observed above @xmath3 , especially with the paraconductivity,@xcite and also with the precursor diamagnetism in dirty low-@xmath3 superconductors.@xcite    in the last few years , however , the results summarized above are being strongly questioned , the claimed disagreements being with both the experimental and the theoretical aspects.@xcite among the first ones , is the anomalous precursor diamagnetism observed in various htsc with different dopings , including the optimal one.@xcite these anomalies are being proposed as a further confirmation of _ unconventional _ ( non - ggl ) scenarios , including those based on the presence of intrinsic @xmath3-inhomogeneities,@xcite on the breaking of the long - range phase coherence by vortex fluctuations,@xcite or on a 3d bose - einstein condensation.@xcite however , it has been shown recently that at least some of these anomalies may be easily explained in terms of @xmath3 inhomogeneities associated with the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in the samples.@xcite in fact , intrinsic - like chemical inhomogeneities and disorder , and then the corresponding @xmath3 inhomogeneities , may be always present in some cuprates ( in particular , in underdoped compounds ) , due to their non - stoichiometric nature.@xcite nevertheless , even when the measured precursor diamagnetism agrees with the ggl predictions , some authors contest the adequacy of these analysis invoking the apparently anomalous magnetization behavior below @xmath3 also in optimally doped cuprates.@xcite    the challenge is , therefore , first to disentangle the diamagnetism due to superconducting fluctuations from the magnetization roundings associated with , intrinsic or not , chemical disorder and inhomogeneities , and then to attempt to analyze these data , consistently above and below @xmath3 , in terms of vortex and cooper pairs fluctuations .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper , where we will first summarize the magnetization measurements in a tl@xmath0ba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( tl-2223 ) single crystal with very high chemical and structural quality .",
    "this compound is stoichiometric , which minimizes the randomness of dopant atom distribution and then the corresponding disorder and inhomogeneities.@xcite these data will be then used to check if the existing gl approaches with fluctuations of vortices and of cooper pairs @xcite explain , at quantitatively and consistently above and below @xmath3 , the diamagnetism measured in homogeneous cuprate superconductors .",
    "the tl-2223 sample used in this work , a @xmath4 mm@xmath5 single crystal , was chosen by its sharp low - field meissner transition from several high - quality single crystals of this nominal composition prepared by a. maignan and coworkers in caen .",
    "details of the growth procedure of these crystals and of their structural characterization may be found in ref . .",
    "the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the magnetization , @xmath6 , around @xmath7 were measured with a superconducting - quantum - interference - device ( squid ) magnetometer ( quantum design ) .",
    "a crucial check of the quality of our crystal is provided by the temperature dependence of its low - field ( 1 mt ) magnetic susceptibility measured under field - cooled ( fc ) and zero field - cooled ( zfc ) conditions ( inset of fig .  1 ) .",
    "under these very low fields , the superconducting fluctuation effects are expected to be negligible @xcite and , therefore , the observed susceptibility roundings above @xmath3 will be mainly due to inhomogeneities and disorder . as it may be appreciated , the meissner transition is very sharp , the transition temperature width , defined as usually,@xcite being around @xmath8 k , and the zero - field critical temperature @xmath9 k. these data also show an exceptionally high meissner fraction , @xmath10 .",

    "this last was obtained by fitting to the @xmath21 curves well above @xmath3 ( between @xmath22150 k and @xmath22250 k ) a curie - like function ( see fig .  1 for an example corresponding to @xmath11 t ) .",

    "was also observed by various groups in different optimally doped and intrinsically underdoped cuprates.@xcite    for temperatures well below @xmath7 , outside the critical region , the fluctuation diamagnetism will be dominated by fluctuations of the two - dimensional vortex ( _ pancakes _ ) positions , which in terms of the gl approach may be seen as fluctuations of the order parameter phase .",

    "3(c ) , close to @xmath24 the resulting @xmath78 follows a linear temperature dependence and tends to zero at @xmath24 , in full agreement with the conventional ( gl ) behavior for @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , by using the previous @xmath43 t , one obtains , as expected , @xmath80 .",
    "it is worth noting that the london theory alone ( without the term due to vortex fluctuations ) fits the data of fig .",
    "3(c ) as well ( it follows the same @xmath18 dependence ) .",
    "however , as earlier stressed by kogan and coworkers,@xcite it would lead to an anomalous @xmath13 close to @xmath24 , due to the presence of the crossing point .",
    "this seemingly anomalous @xmath13 behavior has been recently presented as the hallmark of unconventional behavior for @xmath27.@xcite",
    "we have presented detailled measurements of the diamagnetism around the meissner transition in a high quality tl-2223 single crystal .",
    "these results were analyzed in terms of the ginzburg - landau approach with superconducting fluctuations in the three different fluctuation regions : the gaussian - ginzburg - landau regions above and below @xmath3 and the critical region closer to @xmath7 .",
    "these analysis extend previous comparisons , up to now performed consistently only in one or two of these fluctuation regions.@xcite they provide , therefore , an important test of consistency for the applicability of the gl approaches to describe the meissner transition in an optimally doped cuprate .",
    "when combined with previous measurements of different observables around @xmath3,@xcite in particular of @xmath27 in underdoped cuprates,@xcite our present results provide a strong experimental confirmation that the meissner transition in all cuprates is , independently of the doping , a conventional gl transition , although in many cases entangled with , intrinsic or not , disorder and inhomogeneities .",
    "this work may then help to reach a general consensus on the phenomenological descriptions of the superconducting transition in cuprates , which in turn will provide a constraint for the explanations of the critical behavior of any observable around @xmath3 @xcite and , more important , for any proposal of pairing mechanism in these materials .",
