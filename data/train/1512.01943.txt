    "an increase in @xmath35 is not directly associated with an increase in @xmath38 . in our statistical - mechanics model , the approximately constant @xmath38",
    "is explained by a constant average complex size across all receptor - modification levels .",
    "indeed , experiments show that both the level of expression of receptors and the insertion of newly synthesized receptors into the inner membrane by the sec - machinery are highly regulated @xcite .    _",
    "hansen et al . _",
    "@xcite previously presented a dynamic - signaling - team approach to describe the data obtained with tar - only cells in which the allosteric coupling among trimers is represented by a modification - dependent trimer - trimer interaction energy @xmath102 without modeling the actual protein connectivity .",

    "high - resolution imaging of equilibrated receptors in artificial membranes by electron or total internal reflection fluorescence ( tirf ) microscopy may allow direct determination of receptor - complex distributions and their dependence on receptor - modification level and ligand concentration .",
    "using photoactivated localization microscopy ( palm ) @xcite or quantitative immunoblotting @xcite , such an investigation could also be performed on intact cells .",
    "although chea and chew have long been known to mediate receptor interactions @xcite , an increase in the expression level of chea leads to a reduction in receptor cooperativity @xcite .",
    "varying expression levels of chea and chew in our model produced results in agreement with experimental data of _ sourjik and berg _",
    "@xcite , thereby supporting the linker architecture we employed .",
    "the striking observation that increased chea levels lead to higher kinase activities but lower cooperativity is based on the fact that the number of chea dimers per td is highest for single trimers with almost fully developed linker rest groups ( fig . [",
    "fig.counting]b ) .",
    "hence , overexpression of chea , a bridging molecule at the center of the linker , promotes smaller complex sizes .",
    "chea molecules within the rest groups do not contribute to td coupling and curve steepness , but nevertheless add to the activity of the fret signal .",
    "in contrast to what is observed with chea , raising the level of chew leads to larger complex sizes and an increased number of empty membrane sites .",
    "again , this behavior becomes comprehensible when the number of chew molecules per td ( fig .",
    "[ fig.counting]a ) is taken into account .",
    "while this ratio is constant for complexes with rest groups , it increases with complex size in the absence of partially developed linkers .",
    "larger complexes directly incorporate more chea to enhance cooperativity as well as the amplitudes of fret signals observed both in the model and experimentally . in light of our model",
    "the experimental observations are produced by a combination of constant receptor density and ( partial ) linkers .",
    "although partial linkers play a crucial role in the mechanism of our model , their inclusion might appear arbitrary at first .",

    "[ fig.heatmaps ] ) .",
    "is there any evidence to suggest that @xmath43 remains constant when chea and chew expression levels change ?",
    "first , chea and chew binding to the receptors occurs after insertion of the receptors into the membrane .",
    "second , increasing the expression of a protein , e.g. , of chew , should remove ribosomes from translating receptor mrna @xcite .",
    "although expected to be a minor perturbation , this may lead to a reduced receptor density and hence cooperativity .",
    "however , the opposite trend is observed in fret experiments @xcite .    although our assumed linear linker structure chew ",
    "chea~2~chew matches observed stoichiometries @xcite , electron cryotomography images suggest that reality is more complicated @xcite .",
    "modeling of the electron density and spin - labeling studies suggest that chew and the p5 domain of chea form alternating chew / chea rings connecting the trimers , with p5 occupying positions approximately equivalent to chew ( see fig . [ fig.schematicshomology ] ) .",
    "this arrangement is consistent with the strong structural homology between p5 and chew .",
    "however , to describe the fret data obtained with cells with overexpressed chea and chew @xcite , our model predicts that chea~2~ has the role of a bridging molecule and connects trimers via a chew associated with each trimer .",
    "indeed , an alternative linker with direct receptor - chea binding and hence symmetric roles of chea and chew upon clustering does not match the fret data ( see panel d in . ) .",
    "this view is supported by binding assays , which show that chew binds much firmer to receptor trimers than chea to trimers ( see fig .",
    "5a , b in @xcite and also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "+        although our model qualitatively reproduces the experimental fret data , the change in cooperativity with variation in [ w ] is less pronounced in the simulation than in experiments .",
    "recent findings based on electron cryotomography offer a possible explanation for this shortcoming . _ _ briegel et al.__@xcite and _ _ liu et al.__@xcite stress the importance of the implemented core unit stoichiometry , but they propose a second type of linker that only involves chew , with p5/chew interactions replaced by chew / chew interactions @xcite .",
    "to investigate the consequences of these findings for signaling behavior , we allowed for an additional chew  chew~2~chew linker in our model .",

    "the generally increased hill coefficients , and hence sensitivity , may reveal an evolutionary advantage that is not apparent in the tomography images but is detected by fret .",

    "moreover , in addition to excluding chea from signaling ( fig .",
