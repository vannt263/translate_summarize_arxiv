    "gromov - witten theory has a rich history , both in physics and mathematics .",
    "physically , gromov - witten invariants appear in type iia topological string theory as instanton counts associated to interactions between particles .",
    "mathematically , they are invariants associated to symplectic manifolds that , roughly speaking , count pseudoholomorphic curves in the manifold .",
    "the relationship between these two perspectives is conceptually straightforward : as a string moves in time , it sweeps out a compact riemann surface ( its ` worldsheet ' ) .",
    "the amplitudes in string theory encode counts of maps from riemann surfaces into a 3-(complex)-dimensional calabi - yau manifold , and gromov - witten theory assigns invariants to spaces of such maps .    in general , counting holomorphic maps from riemann surfaces to a given target space is a difficult problem in enumerative geometry .",
    "gromov - witten theory has famously benefited from its connections with string dualities , first with mirror symmetry @xcite , and more recently , large @xmath0 duality @xcite . beginning with @xcite , for toric manifolds , gromov - witten invariants associated to maps of closed surfaces have also been systematically computed using localization @xcite .",
    "`` closed '' gromov - witten theory is a natural mathematical counterpart to closed topological string theory , and , in contrast to the `` open '' theory ( i.e. , for maps of riemann surfaces with boundary ) , the moduli spaces involved are rigorously defined .",
    "open gromov - witten theory is the subject of this paper . by analogy with the closed case ,",
    "open gromov - witten theory is a mathematical counterpart to open topological string theory : open strings sweep out compact riemannian surfaces with boundary , and the boundary of the strings are constrained to lie on branes .",
    "these boundary constraints are expressed mathematically as lagrangian submanifolds @xmath2 , and the string amplitudes are encoded by counts of holomorphic maps @xmath3 , with the image of the boundary constrained to lie on @xmath4 : @xmath5 . however , as observed in @xcite , there are additional subtleties in adapting the methods of the closed theory to the open case . in particular , even for well - behaved lagrangian boundary cycles , open gromov - witten invariants depend on an additional integral parameter ( in localization , this parameter corresponds to the weights of the torus action ) .    in spite of this",
    ", the same computational tools of mirror symmetry , large @xmath0 duality , and localization can still be used .",
    "in fact , through these string dualities , open gromov - witten theory can be connected to both classical and homological knot theory @xcite .",
    "motivated by relationships with the crepant resolution conjecture @xcite , open gromov - witten theory can also be generalized to orbifolds @xcite .",
    "this setting has driven a more abstract formulation of open gromov - witten invariants , which has led to a deeper understanding of the a - model .",
    "in particular , as will be discussed in detail below , the open invariants contain gamma classes coming from disk terms @xcite .",
    "in addition , the open gromov - witten generating function can be obtained from a modification of givental s @xmath6 function @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to describe a concise and consistent framework for computing open gromov - witten invariants directly , via localization .",
    "leveraging the formalism of @xcite , the main tool is a formula for open gromov - witten invariants expressed in terms of local combinatorial data and a gamma class .",
    "as expected from @xcite , the construction depends only on the local geometry near a vertex of the moment polytope of @xmath7 . in the case where the associated moduli space of open maps is rigorously defined ( @xcite ) , this formula is proven to be correct .",
    "most intriguingly , this result is shown to apply in two unexpected contexts : enumerative invariants associated to the quintic 3-fold , and lagrangian cycles obtained from torus knots appearing in large @xmath0 duality .",
    "the author hopes that the approach described herein will lead to a more general construction of open gromov - witten invariants .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section  [ sec : preliminaries ] reviews some general facts about open gromov - witten theory , including deformation theory and localization .",
    "most importantly , this section describes how to express an open gromov - witten invariant as the product of a `` disk term '' and an invariant of closed maps .",
    "section  [ sec : main - results ] contains the proof of the main computational tool of this paper :    let @xmath7 be a calabi - yau 3-fold and @xmath2 a lagrangian submanifold .",
    "let @xmath8 act on @xmath7 such that the @xmath8 action preserves @xmath4 , and @xmath4 intersects a rigid circle - invariant curve @xmath9 .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 can be described in a neighborhood of @xmath10 as the fixed locus of an anti - holomorphic involution .",
    "let @xmath11 .",
    "then , the genus @xmath12 , 1 boundary component , degree @xmath13 , winding @xmath14 open gromov - witten invariant with lagrangian boundary @xmath4 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the disk function @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the homogeneous iritani gamma class , @xmath19 is the weight of the @xmath8 action along a normal direction to @xmath9 , @xmath20 is the equivariant chern class of the induced representation of @xmath8 at the attachment point of the disk , and @xmath21 is the equivariant class of the image @xmath22 of the disk attachment point .",
    "this gamma class formula was encountered previously in @xcite , where the authors study a lagrangian locally described as the fixed locus of the antiholomorphic involution @xmath23 .",
    "as will be seen ( lemma [ lem : involution - form ] ) , this result implies the formula above after a change of coordinates .",
    "section  [ sec : comparisons ] describes how to apply the gamma class formula to several examples where the resulting invariant is already known , and demonstrates that this formula reproduces the expected result .",
    "the last two sections study two examples where the assumptions on the local geometry of @xmath4 are not satisfied .",
    "section  [ sec : quintic ] examines disk enumeration on the quintic 3-fold and finds that a slight modification of this formula again applies .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : torus - knot - lagrangians ] applies this formula to a novel class of lagrangian cycles motivated by large @xmath0 duality .",
    "these lagrangian cycles are obtained from the conormal bundles of torus knots in @xmath24 after the conifold transition , and do not have the same local description required in the above theorem .",
    "nevertheless , the main result of this paper is still found to apply to these cycles .",
    "the examples in sections [ sec : quintic ] and [ sec : torus - knot - lagrangians ] hint that a version of the theorem may hold for a broader class of lagrangian cycles .",
