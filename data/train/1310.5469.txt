    "we consider two natural choices for the parameter @xmath0 for our optimization variants of the square root problem and in this way obtain the first fpt algorithms for square root problems .",
    "first , in section  [ s - min ] , we parameterize the minimum square root problem , which is that of testing whether a graph has a square root with at most @xmath33 edges for some given integer @xmath33 . because any square root of a connected @xmath1-vertex graph @xmath13 is a connected spanning subgraph of @xmath13 , every square root of @xmath13 has at least @xmath34 edges .",

    "our main result is that minimum square root is fpt  with parameter @xmath0.-vertex graphs with @xmath39 connected components the natural parameter is @xmath40 instead of @xmath38 . because a square root of a graph is the disjoint union of square roots of its connected components , our fpt  result for connected graphs immediately carries over to disconnected graphs if we choose as parameter @xmath40 instead . ]",
    "we prove this result by showing that an instance of minimum square root can be reduced to an instance of a more general problem , in which we impose additional requirements on some of the edges , namely to be included or excluded from the square root .",
    "we prove that the new instance has size quadratic in @xmath0 . in other words , we show that minimum square root has a generalized kernel of quadratic size ( see section  [ sec : defs ] for the definition of this notion ) .",
    "this result is further motivated by the observation that minimum square root generalizes the problem of recognizing squares of trees ( take @xmath41 ) . a weaker statement of our fpt  result is that of saying that the problem of recognizing squares of graphs of the class @xmath42 is polynomial - time solvable for all fixed @xmath5 . as such , our result can also be seen as an extension of the aforementioned result of recognizing squares of trees  @xcite .",
    "second , in section  [ s - max ] , we parameterize the maximum square root problem , which is that of testing whether a given graph @xmath13 with @xmath2 edges has a square root with at least @xmath33 edges for some given integer @xmath33 .",
    "we show that this problem is fpt  with parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this choice of parameter is also natural , as @xmath13 has a square root with at least @xmath33 edges if and only if @xmath13 can be modified into a square root ( of itself ) by at most @xmath0 edge deletions .",
