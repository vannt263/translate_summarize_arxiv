    "the sba seyfert 1 galaxy ngc7469 is a luminous infrared source with @xmath3l@xmath4 , assuming a distance of 66mpc ( taking h@xmath5mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xcite ) .",
    "much of the interest in the galaxy has been focussed on the circumnuclear ring structure on scales of 1.52.5 , which has been observed at radio @xcite , optical @xcite , mid infrared @xcite , and near infrared @xcite wavelengths .",
    "these data suggest that recent star formation in this ring contributes more than half of the entire bolometric luminosity of the galaxy . additionally , as much as one third of the k - band continuum within 1  of the nucleus may also originate in stellar processes rather than the agn itself @xcite .",
    "ngc7469 is therefore a key object for studying the relation between circumnuclear star formation and an agn , and how gas is brought in to the nucleus to fuel these processes .",
    "this crucial question is still the subject of much debate .",
    "it has been known for some time that bars can form in the disks of galaxies , and that the shocks in the diffuse gas associated with these can drive the gas from the disk on scales of 10kpc down to the nucleus on scales of 1kpc .",
    "however , it is only more recently that the issue of whether or not bars within bars might be able to drive the gas even further to the centre has been studied in more detail , both observationally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one classic example is the seyfert 2 ngc1068 which has a circumnuclear ring at 15  ( 1kpc ) , inside of which is a bar and near the nucleus another gaseous ring at 1  ( 70pc ) @xcite .",
    "we wish to investigate whether dynamical processes may be operating in ngc7469 which help to drive gas from the circumnuclear ring further towards the centre .    to do so we have brought together the unique combination of high resolution radio co data and near infrared adaptive optics h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) data , giving us a tool with which we can probe the distribution and dynamical structure of the molecular gas across nearly 2 orders of magnitude in spatial scale .",
    "our data are presented in section  [ sec : obs ] . in section  [ sec : co ] we consider the properties of the molecular gas with respect to both the radio co2 - 1 and near infrared 1 - 0s(1 ) emission .",
    "we present a single mass model which is able to reproduce the kinematics of both sets of data , and discuss the issue of non - circular motions associated with bars and spiral arms . finally in this section , we turn to the excitation process of the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission , and the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion ratio .",
    "section  [ sec : starclus ] discusses the nuclear star formation .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarised in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we have mapped the @xmath8coj=2@xmath91 and hcnj=1@xmath90 lines in ngc7469 with the iram millimeter interferometer on the plateau de bure , france @xcite .",
    "the co2 - 1 and hcn1 - 0 data were obtained in january 1997 . the array consisted of 5 15-m antennas positioned in 2 configurations providing 20 baselines ranging from 32400 m .",
    "we observed ngc7469 for @xmath29hrs in each configuration for a total of 18hrs of integration time .",
    "the antennas were equipped with dual frequency sis receivers enabling us to observe the co and hcn lines simultaneously .",
    "ssb system temperatures above the atmosphere were @xmath2120k at the 86ghz frequency of the hcn1 - 0 line and @xmath2350k at the 228ghz frequency of the co2 - 1 line .",
    "3c345.3 was observed for bandpass calibration as well as every half hour for phase and amplitude calibration .",
    "absolute fluxes were established by assigning flux of 3.5jy and 6.0jy to 3c454.3 at 228ghz and 86ghz respectively .",
    "fluxes of strong sources are determined through careful monitoring with both the interferometer and the iram 30-meter telescope on pico veleta , spain .",
    "based on the monitoring measurements , we assume that the accuracy of the flux scale is better than 20% .",
    "the phase noise on the longest baselines was 20@xmath1030@xmath10 , even at the higher frequency .",
    "spectral resolution of 2.5mhz , corresponding to @xmath26.5  for the hcn1 - 0 line and 3.3  for the co2 - 1 line , was provided by 6 autocorrelator spectrometers covering the total receiver bandwidth of 500mhz ( 1300  for hcn and 650  for co2 - 1 ) .    in an earlier set of runs between october and december 1994",
    ", the @xmath8coj=1@xmath90 line was mapped using 4 antennae in 4 configurations providing 24 baselines in the range 24288 m .",
    "the data were calibrated and reduced in the same way , yielding a final resolution of 2.5 .",
    "because the co2 - 1 data supercede these data , we use the older data only in section  [ sec : co - h2 ] to estimate the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor .",
    "the map itself has been presented previously by @xcite .",
    "all the data were first calibrated using the iram clic software .",
    "we then made uniformly weighted channel maps for the co2 - 1 and hcn data .",
    "we cleaned all the maps using software available as part of the gildas package . to increase the sensitivity maps",
    "were made with a velocity resolution of 20  in all three lines .",
    "the cleaned maps were reconvolved with 0.7and 2  fwhm gaussian beams for the co2 - 1 and hcn1 - 0 lines respectively .",
    "the rms noise after cleaning is 1mjybeam@xmath6 in the hcn1 - 0 maps , and 4mjybeam@xmath6 in the higher resolution co2 - 1 maps .",
    "the co is centered kinematically at @xmath11 , consistent with that found by @xcite in their co observations . the integrated co2 - 1 and",
    "hcn1 - 0 line maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comap ] , while sample spectra from the central 3of the co2 - 1 channel maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cospectra ] . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that , even at sub - arcsecond resolution , we have achieved a signal - to - noise ratio of at least 20 throughout the central regions of ngc7469 .",
    "the data were obtained on the nights of 1112 nov 2002 using nirspec behind the adaptive optics system on the keck ii telescope .",
    "spectra were obtained in low resolution mode in the k - band , providing a nominal resolution of r=2000 with a slit 37mas wide and 3.93  long .",
    "the wavelength coverage is sufficient to include all the k - band in a single setting .",
    "two position angles were used : 33@xmath10 ( to bisect two of the bright star forming knots in the k - band image of @xcite ) and 100@xmath10 .",
    "the latter was chosen to include the supernova remnant @xcite , although this proved unsuccessful due to uncertainties in the positioning and the narrowness of the slit .",
    "the positions and widths of the slits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : starsgas ] on top of a composite of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) j - band image ( green ) and co image ( red ) .",
    "individual exposures of 5min were used , and the object was moved to a new pixel row after each exposure . in total integration times 85min and",
    "100min were achieved at the two position angles respectively .",
    "since the slit was not long enough to permit nodding , a few sky frames were taken .",
    "standard calibrations were performed , including atmospheric standard stars ( using the type b9v star hd218624 ) , arcs , flatfields , and dark frames .",
    "the data were reduced using pc - iraf 2.11.3 using standard techniques , with the single exception that all the frames were resampled at half the pixel scale before applying any rotation or curvature correction . the final step was to rebin the data once all the exposures were combined , providing a spectral scale of @xmath12and a spatial scale of 34.8mas .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution , as measured from the arc lamp lines , was 104  fwhm .",
    "continuum subtracted images of the spectral region covering the 1 - 0s(1 ) and br@xmath13 lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dspec ] .",
    "the reference for the adaptive optics system was ngc7469 itself .",
    "the correction provided  and hence spatial resolution achieved  by the ao was similar on both nights due to the excellent atmospheric conditions .",
    "it was measured on the second night by taking a spectrum of a star , after using neutral density filters to reduce its count rate on the wavefront sensor to that measured on ngc7469 itself .",
    "additionally , the ao parameters ( frame rate and gains ) were set to those used on the object .",
    "the spectrum was reduced in exactly the same way . as expected , the resolution improves at longer wavelengths , but is measured to be 85mas near the 1 - 0s(1 ) and br@xmath13 lines , and 80mas near the co absorption at 2.3 . an alternative method to estimate the spatial resolution directly from the agn itself is described in the text .",
    "flux calibration using the atmospheric standard star yielded k - band magnitudes of 13.97 and 14.01 within a 0.5  length of the 37mas slit , for position angles 33@xmath10 and 100@xmath10 respectively . extrapolating the profile symmetrically over a circular aperture with diameter 0.5  gives @xmath14 ; similarly in a 1  aperture we find @xmath15 .",
    "however , we note that there is a considerable uncertainty associated with the calibration due to the difficulty of positioning both the standard star ( with a diffraction limited fwhm of about 45mas ) and ngc7469 ( which had poorer correction ) on a slit which is only 37mas wide .",
    "the main features in the 0.7  resolution co2 - 1 map in fig .  [ fig : comap ] are a very bright marginally resolved central source , a partial ring or spiral arms at a radius of 1.52.5  ( 500800pc ) , and a bright bar - like structure leading from the arms to the central source .",
    "the regions of co emission are in general not coincident with the knots of k - band continuum emission , which trace the active star forming areas .",
    "this is easily seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : starsgas ] , which overlays the stellar light in green on the co emission in red .",
    "we have used the _ hst _",
    "j - band image for the stellar light because the contrast of the star forming knots is stronger than in the k - band , although in both bands the knots occur in the same places . for this figure , and in the analysis presented here",
    ", we have assumed that the nuclear near infrared and co peaks are aligned .",
    "there is some suggestion that the dynamical centre and the co peak may be offset by @xmath20.1  ( which may be expected if , as we show in section  [ sec : kin ] , the nuclear co is distributed in a ring ) and so it is possible that the co and near infrared peaks are also slightly misaligned .",
    "however , because the offset is well within the resolution limits of the co data and we have no other way to perform accurate astrometry for the spectroscopic data , we have ignored this small discrepancy .",
    "the figure shows that along the major axis ( roughly north west ) the star forming knots lie inside the ring of co emission , while along the minor axis they overlap .",
    "the radio continuum images show a greater similarity to the co map , with bright star forming regions at the ends of the bar ( r2 and r3 in @xcite ) , and tracing the same spiral / ring pattern as the co2 - 1 out to @xmath16 .    to compute the total line fluxes in the maps and the intensity - weighted mean velocity fields , we used uniformly weighted maps and ran the moments routine in the gipsy package @xcite .",
    "we did not include in the sum any emission below a limit of 2.5@xmath17 , and only included those features which were present in at least 2 adjacent line channels .",
    "the total co1 - 0 flux we observed was 300jy , consistent with that observed interferometrically by @xcite , and only sightly less than the 400jy  single dish flux of @xcite .",
    "we observe a total flux of 470jy  in the high resolution co2 - 1 map .",
    "@xcite measure a flux of @xmath2800jy  with both the nrao 12-m and the james clerk maxwell telescopes , indicating that we are missing 3050% of the single dish flux after accounting for calibration uncertainties in all of the measurements .",
    "this missing flux likely comes from extended faint emission which is evident in the co1 - 0 map ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of hcn in the nuclear region of the galaxy indicates the presence of dense gas , with molecular hydrogen volume densities of order @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "however , using the hcn / co ratio to make quantitative statements is not possible since the abundance ratio is unknown : it typically lies in the range @xmath20 in quiescent clouds to @xmath21 in star forming cores @xcite , while @xcite have argued that in the nuclear regions of ngc1068 it is more like @xmath22 .",
    "we have quantified the motions in the central few arcseconds of ngc7469 by two different methods .",
    "first we solved for the velocity field using the rotcur task @xcite in the gipsy data reduction package .",
    "this program divides the galaxy into a series of concentric tilted rings each having some circular velocity , and makes least squares fits to the kinematic parameters of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "although the program does not account for beam smearing effects , this is only a concern in the inner arcsecond where the rotation curve is steeply rising . in regions outside this ,",
    "beam smearing effects are not as serious .",
    "we have fit for the rotation velocity and inclination angle by holding the kinematic position angle ( pa=@xmath23 ) , the systemic velocity ( @xmath7 ) , and the position of the center of rotation constant as a function of radius .",
    "we have not extended the fit beyond a radius of about 3 . the velocity field found by this task",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcur ] .    in such fits",
    "the inclination angle is an uncertain parameter because it is degenerate with the actual rotation velocity .",
    "we are unable to constrain it using the rotcur task , and instead we consider the distribution of the co emission knots around the nucleus .",
    "if these form a pair of spiral arms , the pitch angle should have no abrupt changes through the length of the arms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : comap ] clearly shows that in ngc7469 , if the features were continuous spiral arms , there would indeed be an abrupt change in their pitch angle .",
    "the alternative is to interpret the structure as a ring at a constant radius of about 2.5  with a short pair of loosely wound spiral arms or a bar leading to them from the nucleus .",
    "with such a configuration , the inclination must lie in the range 4550@xmath10 , consistent with the 45@xmath10 inclination of the outer stellar disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore adopt an inclination of 45@xmath10 in this paper .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the position angle from the beam size and the scale over which the fitting was performed , yielding @xmath24 .",
    "inspection of the channel maps for the innermost co data and also for the hcn data , reveals that there is no evidence for a different kinematic major axis between the ring and the nucleus : within the uncertainties all the data are consistent with a single major axis .",
    "@xcite were able to resolve the nucleus of ngc7469 at 12.5@xmath1 m using adaptive optics on the keck telescope , and measured a position angle of 135@xmath10 for the emission on scales of 0.1 .",
    "this is consistent with the 128@xmath10 we find , and supports our conclusion that the ring on scales of 3  and the nucleus on scales of 0.7  are oriented in the same plane .",
    "the bar or spiral arm structure at a position angle of 56@xmath10 is unique to the molecular gas and is evident neither in near infrared k - band images @xcite , nor in sub - arcsecond resolution 8ghz radio continuum maps @xcite .",
    "if it were a bar , this would represent a very unusual configuration since stellar bars usually are seen together with , and more prominently than , molecular bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is , however , possible that the bar is an illusion , arising because the spatial scales are small  not much more than a few times the spatial resolution  which might lead to blending among different clumps of co emission",
    ". this would be particularly noticeable along the minor axis , due to the 45@xmath10 inclination , which lies close to the axis where the bar is seen .",
    "such a possibility appears to be supported by the fact that our data for ngc7469 exhibit none of the kinematic characteristics expected for a barred potential .",
    "the velocity field in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcur ] shows no evidence for the @xmath25-shaped contours that arise in such cases ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; on the contrary it is remarkably uniform . additionally , there is no evidence for a tilted-@xmath26 pattern in the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram taken along the bar axis ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : copv ] ) .",
    "these are characteristic of bar driven dynamics , and arise from the high velocities associated with the @xmath27 and @xmath28 orbits parallel and perpendicular to the bar .",
    "because the orientation of the bar is less than 20@xmath10 from the minor axis , the high speed motions in the @xmath28 orbits will be correspondingly close to the plane of the sky , and so may not be readily apparent in a p - v diagram ; on the other hand , the @xmath27 orbits should be more easily detectable .",
    "however , the same blending as above , which might result in the illusion of a bar could also conspire to make non - circular motions extremely difficult to detect .",
    "furthermore , the relatively bright disk component and the large turbulent velocity ( see section  [ sec : kin ] ) of 60  fwhm would tend to swamp and hide the effects of non - circular motions .",
    "an alternative might be that the structure is a pair of loosely wound spiral arms , which would be associated with smaller non - circular motions @xcite that might not be detectable in our data . without a more complete dynamical analysis we can neither rule out nor confirm whether this apparent structure might be a bar or pair of spiral arms .",
    "we therefore defer a discussion of non - circular motions associated with spiral arms or a bar until later , and assume initially in our dynamical analysis in section  [ sec : kin ] that the kinematic structure can be modelled axisymmetrically .      as has been seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dspec ] , strong narrow 1 - 0s(1 ) emission was observed across the nucleus of ngc7469 at both position angles .",
    "we have measured the flux and velocity at each point along the slit by fitting a gaussian line profile to the 30 pixels ( 1800 ) around the line in each row of the spectrum .",
    "initially , the velocity dispersion was left as a free parameter . however , in every row of both position angles the derived value was consistent with a constant 210  fwhm .",
    "we therefore fixed the dispersion at this value . correcting for the instrumental resolution yields an intrinsic dispersion of 185  fwhm .",
    "the relative flux and velocity are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2pv ] .",
    "the velocity zero point was taken as the velocity measured in the row where the continuum was a maximum , and was 4965 and 4950  for the 2 position angles .",
    "the uncertainty in each velocity measurement was determined by constructing a 30 pixel segment , which had the same noise as the original residual spectrum ( after subtracting the gaussian ) , and to which the fitted gaussian was added .",
    "a new gaussian profile was then fitted to the segment , producing slightly different parameters .",
    "the procedure was repeated 100 times , providing an estimate of the uncertainties , which are shown as the error bars in the figure .    the total flux in a 0.5  length of the slit is @xmath29wm@xmath30 and @xmath31wm@xmath30 for pas 33@xmath10 and 100@xmath10 respectively .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is easily resolved with fwhm of 0.45  and 0.33  at pas 33@xmath10 and 100@xmath10 respectively .",
    "these sizes are several times larger than the spatial resolution , and so the difference can not be due to changes in the resolution on the two nights ( see section  [ sec : contslope ] ) .",
    "we conclude that , from our line of sight , the h@xmath0 emitting region is asymmetrical , although with data from only two slit position angles , we can not fully constrain its size and shape .",
    "an h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) image of ngc7469 using the adaptive optics system on the canada - france - hawaii telescope was presented by @xcite . however , the difficulties of continuum subtraction , differing resolutions , and the bright nucleus , mean that no morphological information is available in the inner 0.5 .      following the method outlined in @xcite",
    ", we have constructed kinematic models which can explain the various features observed in the kinematic major and minor axis p - v maps , and which also estimate the rotation velocities inside a radius of 5 . as a starting point",
    ", these models use the position angle and inclination derived previously and assume that all the gas lies in a thin disk in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we then work towards an axisymmetric mass surface density model which matches the observed velocities in the p - v maps as closely as possible . because the process converges to the final solution iteratively",
    ", the initial radial distribution is not critical .",
    "ideally , to reduce the number of iterations one would consider the full mass distribution : of the stars ( young and old populations ) and the gas .",
    "however , this requires that the gas mass ( i.e. the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor ) is known _ a priori _  and we derive it afterwards in section  [ sec : co - h2 ] . as a starting point ,",
    "if one assumes that the conversion factor is similar to that for the galaxy , one finds that the gas mass dominates the total mass within a radius of a few arcsec . as we show in section  [ sec : co - h2 ] , in the central regions the molecular gas does indeed account for more than half of the total mass .",
    "in particular , if one considers only the region where there are recently formed stars , the annulus 1.32.3 , we find that the mass of molecular gas is approximately 4 times that of the young stars .",
    "we therefore use an initial radial mass distribution for our model based on the observed co distribution .",
    "the model allows us to define the mass surface density as a function of radius using any number of gaussian distributions , each characterised by a relative scaling , a fwhm , and a radial offset .",
    "the mass of the whole system is then scaled to that needed to match the observed velocities for the given inclination . in the last two steps ,",
    "the distribution is convolved spatially and spectrally .",
    "the spatial kernal is identical to the beam ( 0.7  for the co , 0.085  for the h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the spectral kernal represents the turbulent velocity , that is random motions on scales smaller than the beam . if this is small , the kernal can instead be used to represent the effect of the instrumental spectral resolution",
    "we compare the model p - v distributions with the data , and adjust the radial mass distribution appropriately , iterating until there is sufficient agreement between model and data .",
    "this is a qualitative assessment , rather than a formal measurement of chi - squared .",
    "the reason is that in this situation  where the model is necessarily much simpler than the data  a chi - square value is often strongly affected by inhomogeneities in the data ( which the model is not expected to duplicate ) and a minimisation routine can easily converge to a model that a person would clearly see is wrong .",
    "we have therefore iterated on the model until it matches the main features in the data as well as possible . using this method",
    "we have derived a single mass model which matches the kinematics from both the co radio data and the near infrared h@xmath0 spectroscopic data at their different resolutions .",
    "we have found that 3 components are needed to adequately match the data , scaled to a total dynamical mass of @xmath32m@xmath4 within a radius of 5 .",
    "these are summarised in table  [ tab : massmod ] , and also in fig .",
    "[ fig : massmod ] which shows the mass surface density profile , the enclosed mass , and the resultant velocity in the plane of the galaxy as functions of radius .",
    "the broad disk component is represented by a gaussian centered on the nucleus at @xmath33  with a fwhm of 4.8 ; the ring is defined by a gaussian at @xmath34  that has a fwhm of 0.8 , and with a peak intensity approximately twice that of the disk component ; the nucleus itself is represented by a gaussian at @xmath35 , a fwhm of 0.6 , and a peak approximately 4 times the disk component .",
    "additionally , a turbulent velocity of 60  fwhm for the co , and 185  fwhm for the 1 - 0s(1 ) , was needed to match the observed line widths . that the linewidth is much higher for the 1 - 0s(1 )",
    "may be because the near infrared h@xmath0 emission traces a hotter and more turbulent component of the molecular gas .",
    "the p - v diagrams for the major and minor axis of the co emission are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : copv ] .",
    "the equivalent diagrams for the h@xmath0 emission are in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2pv ] . in the latter figure ,",
    "the model is drawn as a single line rather than contours because otherwise the large line width makes it difficult to compare to the data .",
    "the velocity dispersion is dominated by the turbulent component and hence is nearly constant across the central regions , as measured in the data .",
    "the nuclear component of the model can be interpreted in 2 ways : either there is an approximately uniform mass distribution within a radius of about 0.3  that then falls off like a gaussian ; or there is an inner ring peaking at a radius of about 0.2   with the caveat that if the innermost h@xmath0 lies in a ring , its rotation curve yields a measure of the total mass inside that radius but provides no information about its distribution there .",
    "although the dynamical model can not distinguish between these two options , we show in section  [ sec : starclus ] that most of the mass inside this radius is due to stars rather than gas  and hence that the gas itself does lie in a ring .",
    "additionally , the interpretation as a ring is more readily understood with respect to what is known about other similar galaxies .",
    "for example , co observations of ngc1068 @xcite , which is much closer at a distance of only 14.4mpc , indicate that this galaxy has a circumnuclear ring or spiral arms at @xmath21kpc , a nuclear ring at 70100pc , and a prominent bar ( stellar and gas ) between them .",
    "our dynamical model of ngc7469 suggests there is a circumnuclear ring at @xmath2750pc and a nuclear ring at @xmath265pc , perhaps with short spiral arms or a bar between them .    in ngc1068 ,",
    "@xcite finds non - circular motions associated with the bar and the spiral arms . along the arms ,",
    "the typical streaming motions show an ordered structure but are less than 30 ; in the region of the bar the kinematics are dominated by non - circular motions . for our co data on ngc7469 , a map of the velocity residuals , after subtracting the model from the data , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] .",
    "the standard deviation is 25 , and the strongest residuals are seen around the edges of the map where the flux is weakest and hence the uncertainties greater .",
    "there is no obvious residual structure along the bar axis , which is perhaps surprising given that , for example , @xcite see a residual gradient from @xmath36  to @xmath37  along the bar in the ionised gas of ngc3359 .",
    "it would appear therefore that we can rule out the presence of a strong bar , which can result in residuals of at least this magnitude .",
    "on the other hand , spiral arms , which give rise to residuals of only 1050 , may be present @xcite .",
    "we assume that the bar or spiral pattern implied by the morphology is a real feature , but that the associated non - circular motions are too weak for us to detect and that there is little gas inflow in the region .",
    "indeed , according to the conventional understanding , spiral arms or a bar are expected to exist if the rings are interpreted as occuring at specific resonances associated with spiral density wave theory . under the assumption that the deviations from axisymmetrical orbits are small",
    ", we can use standard theory to estimate the pattern speed of the bar / spiral .    the epicyclic approximation",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) asserts that stellar orbits can be represented by the superposition of a prograde circular orbit with angular velocity @xmath38 and a retrograde elliptical orbit with frequency @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in an inertial frame the motion of these orbits forms unclosed rosettes .",
    "if a nuclear ring forms , it will do so in the vicinity of the inner lindlad resonances ( ilrs ) which occur where , in the frame rotating with the spiral pattern or bar with angular velocity @xmath41 , the orbits close up on themselves .",
    "thus ilrs occur where @xmath42 .",
    "co - rotation ( cr ) occurs where the pattern speed is the same as the orbital speed , @xmath43 .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that more fundamental than the ilrs to the existence of a nuclear ring is in fact the presence of @xmath28 orbits ( perpendicular to the bar ) .",
    "a ring will form if the phase space filled by @xmath28 orbits is sufficiently high that the gas on these orbits interrupts the flow along @xmath27 orbits ( parallel to the bar ) where the two families of orbits intersect .",
    "the location of the nuclear ring moves inwards over time , as a result of inflow of gas from further out along the bar ; and hence the location of the ring can not necessarily be used to constrain the rotation curve of the galaxy .",
    "however , we have shown above that in the circumnuclear region of ngc7469 the non - circular motions are weak and that there is little gas inflow . for a weak bar , the innermost and outermost extent of the @xmath28 orbits along the bar s major axis",
    "are well represented by the location of the ilrs . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite argue that for strong bars the concept of ilrs is not really applicable since the @xmath27 and @xmath28 orbits form closed loops in the bar s reference frame along their entire extent .",
    "how their theory relating the nuclear ring to @xmath28 orbits rather than ilrs should be applied to the case of multiple bars is not clear .",
    "@xcite showed that a secondary ( inner ) bar results from a decoupling of the inner @xmath28 orbits : the @xmath27 and outer @xmath28 orbits behave as expected for the primary bar , while the inner @xmath28 orbits now form the backbone of the inner bar .",
    "that is , they are equivalent to its @xmath27 orbits .",
    "but it is not immediately obvious which orbits could then act as the equivalent of the inner bar s @xmath28 orbits , thus allowing a secondary nuclear ring to form . naively one would conclude that because there is no equivalent of @xmath28 orbits for the inner bar , then there can be no nuclear ring associated with it . however , this must happen since there are many observations of nested rings and bars .",
    "it is certainly clear that our understanding of bars , rings , and gas inflow is still developing .",
    "nevertheless , under the assumption that the non - exisymmetric perturbations are relatively small and that the concept of ilrs retains some meaning , it is helpful to consider the rotation curve of ngc7469 in the context of the epicyclic approximation .    fig .",
    "[ fig : ilr ] shows @xmath38 derived from our model , together with @xmath39 and @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize that we are not trying to use the rotation curve to make predictions about the presence of nuclear rings , or vice - versa ; instead we are using the rotation curve together with the observations of nuclear rings to try and make quantitative statements about the pattern speed of the spiral / bar structure . from the figure we estimate that the pattern speed at radii of 0.52  is about 230240kpc@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite have argued that the circumnuclear ring at 23  arises at the ilr of the large scale bar .",
    "if this is the case , then the ilr of the outer pattern occurs in the vicinity of the cr of the inner pattern , and we expect that the pattern speed of the primary bar is likely to be less than @xmath280kpc@xmath6 . in the standard model of @xcite , such a spatial coincidence is required in order to reduce the number of chaotic zones around the resonances , and may in fact be natural in such dynamical systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite argues that such resonant coupling hinders gas flow to the nucleus because there are no straight shocks along the inner bar .",
    "this could explain why we see no obvious streaming motions within the central few arcsec of ngc7469 . a pattern speed of 200250kpc@xmath6 for the spiral / bar structure in the inner 800pc may provide a natural explanation for why the star forming knots seen in the near infrared images are located at smaller radii than the ring of co emission .",
    "if the k - band image of @xcite is deprojected ( using position angle 128@xmath10 and inclincation 45@xmath10 ) , the knots of star formation lie between radii 1.32.3 .",
    "we suggest that they lie downstream of the spiral / bar pattern seen in the gas . along the pattern ,",
    "the gas density is locally increased and hence star formation is triggered .",
    "if we assume that we are seeing the star clusters at an age of 10myr ( when they appear brightest in the k - band due to the appearance of late type supergiant stars ) , the spiral / bar pattern which triggered the star formation will have moved with respect to the stars in their orbits . taking the angular velocities for the orbits and pattern from fig .",
    "[ fig : ilr ] , we estimate that the distance amounts to 0.40.5kpc ( about 1/5 of a full circle ) at a radius of 0.4kpc ( 1.3 ) , but less than about 0.15kpc at a radius of 0.7kpc ( 2.3 ) since this is close to co - rotation . given also",
    "that the ages of the star clusters may differ from only a fewmyr to more than 10myr , one might expect that the star forming knots are distributed a large part of the way around the central regions of the galaxy , extending away from the spiral / bar pattern but lying within the same radial range ( i.e. inside the ring of co emission ) .",
    "this is what the k - band images indicate .",
    "lastly , we briefly consider the black hole in the nucleus of ngc7469 .",
    "it s mass has been estimated to be 3@xmath45m@xmath4 by using the timescale of the delay between uv and broad balmer line variations together with the fwhm of the broad lines @xcite . given that our mass model already has @xmath46m@xmath4 within a radius of only 0.05 , the rotation curve is insensitive to the effects of such a low mass black hole at our spatial resolution and signal to noise ; we can only distinguish models that have black hole masses exceeding @xmath47m@xmath4 .",
    "it is remarkable that the radial profile of the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission is very different from that of the mass distribution in the model . in section  [ sec : kin ]",
    "we showed that the velocity curves of the co and 1 - 0s(1 ) lines indicate that the mass distribution in the nucleus is extended .",
    "if the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission were to trace this distribution , the expected flux profile would be much broader and flatter than that observed ( red curves in right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : h2pv ] ) .",
    "we can rule out the possibility that the flux profile traces the underlying mass distribution by considering a model in which this is the case . in such a model , in order to match the velocities at radii beyond 0.5 , the mass of the nuclear ring has to be reduced by one third to @xmath48m@xmath4 , and the mass lost from it replaced by a nuclear core component of @xmath49m@xmath4 .",
    "the central part of the resulting rotation curve is much steeper than that actually observed ( blue curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2pv ] ) .",
    "additionally , there would be a measurable increase in the velocity dispersion from 185 to a maximum of nearly 210  fwhm over the central 0.3 .",
    "with our preferred mass model , the dispersion increases by no more than a few  over the central 0.1 , consistent with the lack of any variation seen in the data .",
    "this result  that in ngc7469 the 2 tracers of molecular hydrogen co and 1 - 0s(1 ) have different distributions  is in contrast to what is seen in ngc1068 . in that galaxy both the co @xcite and the 1 - 0s(1 ) @xcite trace the same distribution : a circumnuclear ring on scales of 70100pc .",
    "we suggest that at least some , and perhaps most , of the h@xmath0 is excited by x - ray and uv irradiation from the agn . by comparison to ngc1068",
    ", one would be surprised if this were not the case : in that galaxy , which has a similar bolometric luminosity , the agn is able to cause strong 1 - 0s(1 ) emission even in the circumnuclear ring at a distance of 1kpc @xcite .",
    "if the 1 - 0s(1 ) were excited in this way in ngc7469 , then since the intensity of the x - ray and uv radiation would fall as @xmath50 , or even faster if dust attenuation is important , one would also expect a rapid decrease in the 1 - 0s(1 ) intensity , as observed .",
    "furthermore , the h@xmath0 morphology would depend largely on the details of the dust distribution and clumpiness , and would not necessarily reflect the distribution of the cold gas .",
    "one could test this conclusion further ( davies et al . in prep . ) by obtaining a deep spectrum of the h@xmath0 lines to look for suppression of the 2 - 1s(3 ) line , which @xcite claim to have seen in ngc1275 and which may be a characteristic of x - ray irradiated gas @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass within a radius of @xmath51  of the nucleus has been estimated by @xcite . in this section",
    ", we estimate the dynamical and hence gas mass in the same region in order to determine the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor for the inner 1.6kpc of ngc7469 .",
    "we begin with the assumption that @xmath52 where m@xmath53 is the mass in the old stellar population and m@xmath54 is the stellar mass formed in a recent starburst .",
    "to derive the mass of old stars , @xcite measured the j - band flux density between the nucleus and the ring , and scaled this to the full aperture . using a conversion factor between near infrared flux density and old stellar mass",
    ", they estimated that @xmath55m@xmath4 is in the form of old stars . to determine the mass of recently formed stars , they used starburst models to calculate the parameters of the starburst ring .",
    "their two favoured models imply young stellar masses of about @xmath56m@xmath4 .",
    "hence , the total stellar mass in this region is @xmath57m@xmath4 .    in section",
    "[ sec : kin ] we found that for an inclination of 45@xmath10 , the dynamical mass within 5  is @xmath32m@xmath4 ; within a radius of 2.5  it is @xmath58m@xmath4 .",
    "the difference between this estimate and that in @xcite is due to their assumption of an isotropic velocity field for the late type stars causing the 2.3  co absorption .",
    "if instead the stars move primarily in a low inclination disk plane ( a logical conclusion for a young starburst in which the red supergiants dominate the 2  emission ) , the observed velocities and velocity dispersions become smaller than the intrinsic ones and the discrepancy vanishes .",
    "the mass estimates above lead us to conclude that the total gas mass in the same region is @xmath59m@xmath4 , more than the total mass of stars and several times more than the mass of recently formed stars in the ring .",
    "it is therefore apparent that there is still sufficient gas to continue forming stars for a considerable time . to get to the molecular gas mass , we assume that the masses of hi and hii are negligible contributions to the gas mass at radii interior to 2.5 , and correct for the mass due to helium ( 40% ) .",
    "we find a h@xmath0 mass of @xmath60m@xmath61 within this region .",
    "we can now use this mass to derive a co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor and compare it to the galactic conversion factor between n(h@xmath0 ) and co integrated intensity of @xmath62h@xmath0cm@xmath30(k)@xmath6 @xcite . in terms of the mass of h@xmath0",

    "our previous observation of ngc7469 in the co1 - 0 line ( with a spatial resolution of 2.5 ) with the iram interferometer yielded a total flux of 300jy , roughly half that seen in the single dish spectrum of @xcite . a crude correction for the possibly missing flux",
    "can be made by assuming that the remaining flux is distributed in a smooth source @xmath66  across , the size of structure which would have just been resolved out by the iram interferometer .",
    "the `` surface brightness '' of such a structure would be 0.8jyarcsec@xmath30 . within a radius of 2.5  the co1 - 0",
    "flux is 100jy . including the correction for the possibly missing flux raises this to a maximum of 116jy .",

    "the uncertainty of this value is not trivial to estimate .",
    "accounting for the stellar masses and missing co flux puts it at about 30% . uncertainty in the inclination",
    "is also important : a 5@xmath10 change will alter the dynamical mass by 17% and hence the gas mass by 29% . combining these",
    "we estimate a total uncertainty of about 40% on the conversion factor we have calculated , so that it could lie in the range @xmath690.8 .",
    "there is mounting evidence that the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor in intense star forming environments is less than that for the milky way . @xcite and @xcite found that for ultraluminous galaxies the difference was about a factor five .",
    "they argued that in such cases , it is the warm diffuse phase of the co that dominates the emission , rather than the denser clouds from which the conversion factor is measured in the milky way .",
    "this effect was also observed for ngc7469 by @xcite . while we do not find a discrepancy as large as theirs , within the uncertainties our result tends in the same direction .",
    "the nuclear k - band light from ngc7469 is a combination of thermal emission from hot dust associated with the agn and stellar light , which can be traced through the co2 - 0 bandhead absorption longward of 2.29  in the spectra of late type stars .",
    "although the hot dust emission can dramatically reduce the equivalent width of the stellar absorption features , it does not change their `` flux '' ( absolute absorption ) . hence , under the assumption that the stellar types dominating the co features are invariant throughout the nuclear cluster , the spatial extent of the co flux directly traces the spatial extent of the stellar cluster .    to determine the extent of the co absorption , we have measured the flux in the wavelength range 2.293 - 2.302 .",
    "the continuum level has been determined from an extrapolation of a linear fit to the 2.0862.293  range ( excluding the region around the br@xmath13 line ) .",

    "the equivalent widths of the co bandhead are similar at both position angles , with @xmath70  in a 0.5  length of the slit . by comparison to similar values for late type stars",
    ", one can in principle estimate the fraction of stellar light in the nucleus .",
    "however @xmath71 is very dependent on stellar type , and hence on the age of any star forming episode . to have a measurable co absorption ,",
    "a star cluster must be at least 10myr old . at this age",
    "late type supergiants dominate ; but as the age increases giant stars dominate more . to quantify this effect ,",
    "we have measured the equivalent width of the co bandhead in the same wavelength range for several different stellar templates ( from * ? ? ? * ) and find @xmath72@xmath73depending on stellar type , as shown in table  [ tab : stars ] : @xmath74  for late type dwarfs , @xmath75@xmath76  for giants , @xmath76@xmath73  for supergiants .",
    "these values suggest that stars could contribute anything in the range 540% of the observed continuum at 2.3 .",
    "lower fractions would apply if supergiants dominate the k - band continuum , and higher fractions for giants ; dwarf stars are unlikely to dominate the spectrum due to their intrinsic faintness .",
    "an alternative and completely independent method to estimate the size and brightness of the stellar cluster is to use the slope of the continuum .",
    "we have adopted an iterative procedure to decompose the continuum into stellar and thermal ( hot dust ) parts in each spatial row of the spectrum .",
    "initially , we assume that all the flux in the spatial row where the continuum is a maximum is due to hot dust .",
    "we can then make an initial estimate of its temperature by calculating the spectral shape of the hot dust component and comparing it to that observed .",
    "the second step needs in addition a stellar template of a late type star .",
    "we use the k1.5ib hr8465 from @xcite , although the exact type does not matter as the slopes of all cool stars are similar .",
    "we scale these two components to match as well as possible the observed continuum spectral shape in each other row of the spectrum .",
    "the stellar cluster is traced through the scaling applied to the stellar template , and yields a smooth profile except for the few rows near the centre .",
    "one can interpolate over these to estimate what the stellar contribution in this region should be .",
    "subtracting this from the continuum of the central row used in the initial step leaves something that is closer to the original assumption that ( the remaining spectrum in ) this row is pure hot dust , and allows one to make a new estimate of the hot dust temperature .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the fit converges .",
    "because this process uses the whole slope of the continuum , it provides a high signal - to - noise measurement of the spatial profiles of the hot dust core and stellar cluster . on the other hand",
    ", it is rather sensitive to errors in the slope of either the object spectrum or the standard star used to calibrate out atmospheric features .    since extinction acts to modify the spectral slope , we need to ask whether the results are affected by ignoring it . for the stellar light",
    ", one can examine the spectral shape at an offset of  0.2  from the continuum peak  where stellar light dominates the emission but also where there is still enough flux for a reliable measurement .",
    "we find here that the measured continuum slope matches the stellar template slope well , indicating that there is probably very little reddening of the observed emission .",
    "for the hot dust emission , there is a degeneracy between the temperature of the dust and the extinction towards it . without extinction ,",
    "we derive a characteristic temperature of @xmath77k .",
    "the spectral shape of this blackbody can be reproduced almost exactly by reddening a blackbody with a higher characteristic temperature .",
    "thus , if sublimation limits the maximum temperature of dust grains to @xmath78k , we can constrain the maximum foreground exinction screen to have @xmath79mag . thus , while reddening can change the derived temperature of the hot dust component , it does not affect the relative scaling between this and the stellar light .",
    "the results of the fitting procedure are shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : starclus ] .",
    "the hot dust core ( dotted line ) has a narrower profile than the observed continuum ( solid line ) , and provides a measure of the spatial resolution achieved . at pa33@xmath10 ( first night ) , its fwhm is 118mas , compared with 146mas for the full continuum ; at pa100@xmath10 ( second night ) , its fwhm was 80mas ( cf .",
    "104mas for the full continuum ) , similar to that measured on the psf calibrator .",
    "the difference may be due to a better ao correction on the second night .",
    "the profile of the stellar cluster has been plotted ( suitably scaled ) in the upper panels of the figure . at both position angles",
    ", there is excellent agreement between this profile and that measured from the co bandhead ; the measured fwhms are 223mas at pa 33@xmath10 , and 115mas at pa 100@xmath10 .",
    "this difference is much greater than that in the core noted above , and can not be due solely to the ao performance : at both position angles the stellar cluster is clearly resolved .",
    "applying a quadrature correction for the finite resolution , one derives an intrinsic fwhm of 0.189  at pa 33@xmath10 , equivalent to 60pc at the distance of ngc7469 .",
    "similarly , at pa 100@xmath10 the size is 26pc .",
    "these values are similar to the derived @xmath245pc size of the stellar cluster around ngc1068 @xcite . however , unlike that cluster the one in ngc7469 appears to be distinctly non - axisymmetric . with measurements at only 2 position angles one can not fully determine the morphology , although based on the current observations the cluster does lie fully within the region enclosed by the nuclear ring .    from the scaling of the stellar light component , we find that in a 0.5  length of the slit , it contributes @xmath80% of the continuum at 2.3@xmath1 m ( at both position angles ) .",
    "this is consistent with the upper end of the range derived from the co flux in section  [ sec : coflux ] , as well as the work of @xcite based on pah emission .",
    "these authors found that 25% of the total 3.28@xmath1 m pah emission occurs within a radius of 1  from the nucleus , and they concluded that at least 1/3 of the nuclear k - band light in this region originates in star formation .",
    "a stellar light fraction close to 40% would tend to suggest that , based on the equivalent widths measured in section  [ sec : coflux ] , it is late g and early k type giants which dominate the stellar light .",
    "however , this is an implausible average stellar type .",
    "population synthesis indicates that once the supergiant phase is past , an average type k45 iii is more likely .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that the `` continuum slope '' method above has overestimated the stellar contribution , and that a fraction closer to 20% is more realistic .",
    "an alternative approach to estimate the stellar content of the nuclear cluster is to use the stellar mass and k - band magnitude as constraints on evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "the mass model we derived in section  [ sec : kin ] indicates that within a radius of 0.10  ( chosen to match the fwhm of the nuclear star cluster ) the total mass is only @xmath81m@xmath4 .",
    "the mass of stars in the cluster can not exceed this . the magnitude along the slit within @xmath82  was found in section  [ sec : obs2 ] to be @xmath83mag ; within @xmath84  it is only 0.1mag fainter .",
    "extrapolating to a 0.2  circular aperture increases the brightness to @xmath85 ( 0.8mag fainter than for a 0.5aperture ) .",
    "the stellar light is effectively all included within such an aperture .",
    "if we assume a salpeter imf , solar metallicity , and continuous star formation , the evolutionary synthesis model starburst 99 @xcite allows us to use the magnitude and mass limit above to constrain the fraction of stellar light and the age of the star cluster . in order to avoid exceeding the mass",
    ", the k - band stellar light fraction must be less than 50% .",
    "if it lies in a range 2030% the age of the star formation is constrained to be 1060myr ( older ages are only possible if the stellar light fraction is lower ) .",
    "this yields masses between @xmath86m@xmath4 for younger ages and @xmath81m@xmath4 for older star formation .",
    "there is no set of parameters which yield a significantly lower mass .",
    "given the uncertainties involved , the estimates of the stellar light fraction , the stellar types , the star formation age , and the mass of the cluster fit together in a remarkably consistent way .",
    "we conclude that at least half , and probably most , of the mass within 0.1  of the nucleus of ngc7469 is due to stars rather than gas .    using the same star formation models ,",
    "one finds that the bolometric luminosity for the nuclear cluster is 12@xmath87l@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite estimated the nuclear bolometric luminosity to be @xmath88l@xmath4 .",
    "hence , star formation accounts for 10% of the nuclear luminosity at radii small than 0.1 .",
    "we have presented 0.7  radio co2 - 1 observations and 0.085  adaptive optics k - band spectroscopy of the central region of ngc7469 . using these data we have investigated the distribution and kinematics of the cold and warm molecular gas across nearly 2 orders of magnitude in spatial scale .",

    "this may be because ngc7469 represents the case where straight shocks can not form along an inner bar , and hence there is no gas inflow .",
    "nevertheless , the increase in gas density in the bar / spiral may have triggered star formation and this is now seen as the knots of emission  which lie inside the radius of the molecular ring .",

    "<S> we find that the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion is 0.40.8 times that for the milky way , following the trend to small factors that has been previously reported for intense star forming environments . </S>",
    "<S> the central h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) morphology has a strong peak at the nucleus , but this does not trace the mass distribution ; the rotation curves indicate that there is no strong nuclear mass concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the origins of the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission are instead likely to lie in x - ray and uv irradiation of gas by the agn rather than via processes associated with star formation . using the 2.3@xmath1 m stellar co2 - 0 bandhead absorption and the slope of the continuum we have directly resolved the nuclear star cluster to be 0.150.20  across , and find that it is asymmetric . </S>",
