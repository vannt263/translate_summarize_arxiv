    "during the past several decades there have been significant advances in the accuracy of satellite - based navigation and time transfer systems  @xcite .",
    "the most recent example of such a system is the global positioning system ( gps ) , which is run by the u. s. department of defense  @xcite .",
    "the gps is based on a network of 24 atomic clocks in space , from which a user can receive signals and compute his position and time .",
    "the order of magnitude of the accuracy of the gps currently is ten meters and twenty nanoseconds  @xcite .",
    "future navigation and time transfer systems are being contemplated that will have several orders of magnitude better position accuracy and sub - nanosecond time accuracy  @xcite .    over satellite to ground distances , precise measurements must be interpreted within the framework of a relativistic theory  @xcite .",
    "the design of high - accuracy navigation and time transfer systems depends on detailed modeling of the measurement process .",
    "the comparison of experiment with theory in general relativity is more subtle than in special relativity or other areas of physics for two reasons .",
    "first , due to the possibility of making coordinate gauge transformations , often it is not clear what is a measurable quantity and what is an artifact of the coordinate system  @xcite .",
    "second , all measurements must in - principle be interpreted in the comoving frame of the experimental apparatus  @xcite . in the case of the gps , even theoretical relativistic treatments",
    "do not interpret the measured observable in the comoving frame of the apparatus , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the principle reason for investigating in detail relativistic effects is to improve the current accuracy of gps and to create future time transfer and navigation systems that have several orders of magnitude better accuracy . at the present time , it is well - known that small anomalies exist in position and time computed from gps data .",
    "the origin of these anomalies is not understood .",
    "in particular , gps time transfer data from the naval observatory indicates that gps time is periodic with respect to the master clock , which is the most accurate source of official time for the department of defense  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other anomalies have been found in air force monitor station data that are not understood at present  @xcite .",
    "the work below is a first step in revisiting from a first principles approach some of the physics that has gone into the design of the gps .",
    "a theoretical framework , known as the tetrad formalism , has been developed for relating measurements to relativistic theory@xcite .",
    "however , due to a historical lack of accurate measurements over satellite to ground distances , in most cases it has not been necessary to apply the tetrad formalism in the area of satellite - based systems .",
    "this situation is rapidly changing due to improved measurement technology@xcite .    in the tetrad formalism , measurements are interpreted as projections of tensors on the tetrad basis vectors .",
    "consequently , these projections are invariant quantities ( scalars ) under transformation of the space - time coordinates .",
    "however , these projections do depend on the world line of the observer and the choice of local cartesian axes used by the observer@xcite .",
    "the need for the tetrad formalism to relate experiment to theory , and the problem of measurable quantities in general relativity , are well discussed by synge  @xcite , soffel  @xcite and brumberg  @xcite .",
    "the tetrad formalism was initially investigated for the case of inertial observers , which move on geodesics@xcite . however ,",
    "many users of geodetic satellite systems , are terrestrially based observers , or are based in non - inertial platforms , such as missiles .",
    "the theory for the case of non - inertial observers has been investigated by synge@xcite , who considered the case of non - rotating observers moving along a time - like world line , and by others@xcite , who considered accelerated , rotating observers . for arbitrary observer motions ,",
    "the effects are indeed very complicated , and the general theory gives limited physical insight .",
    "for this reason , in this work , i work out in detail a simple model problem .",
    "i treat the particular case of an observer moving in a circle in minkowski space .",
    "i use the tetrad formalism@xcite to obtain the transformation from an inertial frame in minkowski space , to the accelerated frame of reference of an observer moving in a circle .",
    "the observer fermi - walker transports his tetrad basis vectors .",
    "the case presented here corresponds to an observer kept in a circular trajectory by rockets , he is not on a geodesic .",
    "the explicit results presented below form a particular case of the general results obtained by synge@xcite , specialized to zero gravitational field and circular motion .",
    "the situation treated here also corresponds to a reference frame that has a constant orientation with respect to the distant stars@xcite , such as an earth - centered inertial reference frame used in gps satellite computations .",
    "the results are given here as expansions in small velocity of the observer , compared with speed of light .",
    "however , the coordinate transformation equations are not expanded in a power series in time , and hence , they are valid for arbitrary long times .",
    "this work explores the apparent behavior of ideal clocks as observed from a fermi coordinate frame of reference of an observer moving in a circle in flat space - time .",
    "the fermi coordinate frame is the closest type of non - rotating frame to that which is used in experiments and in gps . in particular ,",
    "a fermi coordinate frame is a non - rotating frame of reference , where coriolis forces are absent , and light travels essentially along a straight line@xcite .",
    "the observer s fermi frame in this work is analogous to the earth - centered inertial ( eci ) frame used in gps",
    ". the eci frame moves with the earth but maintains its orientation with respect to the distant stars .",
    "this work neglects all gravitational field effects that are significant for the actual behavior of gps clocks .",
    "as such , this work treats only the kinematic effects associated with the circular motion of the fermi coordinate frame about a central point ( analogous to the sun s position ) . since gravitational fields are neglected in this work , the observer s tetrad",
    "is fermi - walker transported along a time - like world line ( a circle in 3-d space ) . in the case of gps , the origin of the eci frame follows a geodesic path ( the earth s orbit ) .",
    "therefore , the observer s fermi frame in this work is an accelerated , non - rotating frame , while the eci frame is in free fall . as remarked above",
    ", the effects on clocks are in general very complicated , even without the gravitational field .",
    "for this reason , i work out in detail the specific case of an observer in circular motion in minkowski space - time , and i apply the results to parameters that are relevant to the gps .",
    "consider a time - like world line @xmath0 of an observer moving in a circle in 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) space given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are constants , @xmath6 is a parameter along the world line , and @xmath7 is the speed of light in an inertial frame in vacuum .",
    "the observer travels in a circle in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "see figure [ observermotionfigure ] .",

    ", the east - moving and west - moving clocks would have zero time difference after one revolution .",
    "however , since the origin of fermi coordinates moves along a circle , the acceleration picks out a direction in the fermi coordinate space - time and the symmetry between the two clock world lines is broken .",

    "note that the time difference on the two clocks increases with increasing angular velocity of rotation @xmath164 , analogous to the optical sagnac effect@xcite .",
    "this increase is due to the fact that the breaking in symmetry is due to the magnitude of the acceleration , @xmath165 , see eq.([zetadef1 ] ) . using the values of the parameters appropriate to gps satellites , given in table 1",

    "i have considered the problem of an observer moving in a circle around a central point in flat space ( no gravitational fields ) .",

    "he keeps his axes at a constant orientation with respect to the gyroscopes spin axes .",
    "the observer s axes are fermi transported along his world line and fermi coordinates are defined .",
    "the fermi time coordinate is just the observer s proper time , according to the construction shown in figure [ observermotionfigure ] .",
    "fermi coordinates play the role of eci frame coordinates in gps .",
    "i investigate the kinematic effects seen on ideal clocks from the point of view of these fermi coordinates .",
    "specifically , i consider two cases : stationary clocks ( with respect to fermi coordinates ) and satellite clocks in circular orbit with respect to fermi coordinates . the proper time interval between two events on the stationary clock , given by eq.([stationaryclock ] ) , is a complicated periodic function of the clock s fermi coordinate time and coordinate position in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "i considered next a clock that orbits the fermi coordinate origin ( similar to a satellite ) in the equatorial plane of rotation and computed the relation of proper time to coordinate time .",
    "i find that the proper time on the clock has time dilation ( constant rate offset ) plus a periodic dependence on fermi coordinate time at the difference frequency , @xmath187 , between satellite clock orbital frequency , @xmath188 , and fermi coordinate frame orbital frequency , @xmath164 .",
    "next , i looked at the time difference of two counter - orbiting clocks in the equatorial plane of rotation , one west - moving and the other east - moving .",
    "after one revolution , the difference in proper time on the clocks shows a small sagnac - like effect , increasing with the angular frequency of revolution of the fermi frame , @xmath164 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eastwesttimedifference ] ) .",
    "finally , i computed the coordinate speed of light in the fermi coordinates .",
    "the speed of light is isotropic ( same in all directions ) , but is not homogeneous . specifically , the speed of light depends on fermi coordinate position and time , but not on direction .",
    "equation ( [ fclightspeedvariation2 ] ) gives the change in the speed of light from @xmath7 , its vacuum value in an inertial frame .",
    "i have computed the magnitudes of these effects for numbers relevant to gps satellite orbits and orbital frequency .",
    "the effects are all small for gps , except for the 12 ns periodicity for an orbiting clock , given in eq .",
    "( [ orbitingclock1 ] ) , that occurs at the difference frequency , @xmath187 , between satellite orbital frequency @xmath188 and earth orbital frequency @xmath164 .",
    "this effect is reminiscent of the periodic effect in gps described in the introduction .",
    "however , the effects here are all kinematic since gravitational fields are neglected .",
    "the inclusion of gravitational fields is expected to significantly modify the results . in particular , from the work of ashby and bertotti , this 12 ns periodic effect is expected to cancel when gravitational fields are included  @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to extend these results to include the effects of gravitational fields .    while the effects discussed in this work are small for the present gps , these effects are quite significant for future navigation and time transfer systems that are expected to have sub - nanosecond time transfer accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the author thanks tom van flandern for useful discussions .",
    "i use the notation and conventions of synge@xcite , except that my space - time indices on coordinates , @xmath24 , take values @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , i use the convention that roman indices take the values @xmath19 , and greek indices @xmath20 .",
    "i use the summation convention for repeated indices , when the same index appears in a lower and upper position then summation is implied over the range of the index .",
    "if @xmath24 and @xmath189 are two events along the world line of an ideal clock , then the square of the proper time interval between these events is @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is given in terms of the space - time metric as @xmath192 and i choose @xmath94 to have the signature @xmath1932 .",
    "when @xmath94 is diagonalized at any given space - time point , the elements can take the form of the flat space minkowski metric given by @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 .",
