    "the spectra of bright blazars obtained by _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "( _ fermi _ ) large area telescope ( lat ) showed clear deviations from a power - law shape @xcite .",
    "there spectra could not be described by smooth functions such as exponentially cutoff power - law or a log - parabola ( log - normal distribution ) , but were found to be better described by a broken power - law .",
    "the derived break energies lying in the 110 gev energy range @xcite were rather stable @xcite .",
    "those breaks seemed puzzling : the hypothesis that the break is caused by photon - photon annihilation through @xmath2 pair production was considered and rejected by @xcite , who argued that `` to produce a break in the 110 gev , the photon field should have an energy peaking in the 0.050.5 kev range , which excludes the broad - line region peaking in the uv . ''",
    "the conclusion that such large energies of the target photons were required was based on an erroneous assumption that the break energy correspond to the maximum cross - section for pair production .",
    "@xcite suggested that the breaks should actually appear at the energies close to the threshold for a corresponding reaction , where the opacity has a sharp rise .",
    "the observed breaks at a few gev correspond then well ( correcting for the redshift ) to the lyman recombination continuum ( lyc ) and ly@xmath3 emission of ionized he .",
    "they also showed that the inner part of the blr can provide sufficient flux of   lyman lines and lyc to provide enough opacity for gev photons and to produce a spectral break .",
    "@xcite further demonstrated that the data for a number of bright blazars are well described by a power - law spectrum modified by the absorption within the blr . the fits with this model were acceptable and the reduction in @xmath4 ( compared to a simple power - law model ) was very significant .",
    "similar @xmath4 could also be achieved with the broken power - law model which , however , does not have any physical basis .",
    "a high significance of the spectral breaks partially results from a null hypothesis for the underlying spectrum , which is assumed to be a power - law .",
    "however , a typical blazar has a curved spectrum extending over many orders in energy and peaking in the mev  gev range .",
    "this implies that the spectrum in the _ fermi _ energy band should be slightly concave and the power - law null hypothesis gives an overestimated significance of the break . as a more realistic null hypothesis one can take a lognormal distribution ( log - parabola ) , which is the simplest way to introduce a curvature in logarithmic coordinates .",
    "@xcite studied in details the spectrum of the exceptionally bright flat - spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) 3c  454.3 and indeed found that the spectrum below the absorption break significantly differs from the power - law and can be well described by a log - parabola . with this null hypothesis",
    "the statistical significance of any break is lower than with a power - law hypothesis .",
    "however , the absorption break in the time - integrated spectrum of 3c  454.3 was still highly significant and its energy coincided with the predicted one from   lyc absorption .    while the main attention of the cited papers has been payed to the gev breaks , @xcite and @xcite also revealed hydrogen lyc breaks at @xmath020 gev , which were less significant and less impressive because of a lower photon statistics in that energy range",
    "actually , it is obvious that in most cases h ly radiation should produce a stronger absorption feature that   ly emission .",
    "that is why it is important to revisit the spectral analysis of bright blazars with a higher statistics that was accumulated since previous works .",
    "another , more important reason to revisit previous results is a slight but significant difference in the blazar spectra obtained with the new pass 7 version of the _",
    "fermi_/lat data and detector response and those obtained with the older pass 6 version .",
    "the new spectra look smoother and this is a reason to suspect that the sharp breaks at a few gev were the artifacts of the pass 6 response function  partially or completely .",
    "we use _ fermi_/lat photon data for 1740 days ( from 2008 august 6 till 2013 may 12 ) using the new pass 7 event classification , selecting photons of clean class , and imposing the cut on the zenith angle at @xmath5 .",
    "we used ` p7_clean_v6 ` response function .",
    "the diffuse background was calculated using the background model elaborated by the _ fermi _ team .",
    "it should be noted that the pass 7 response function significantly differs from the pass 6 one in at least two aspects :    1 .",
    "it has a wider point spread function , 2 .",
    "it has a different effective area function ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : acceptance ] ) .",
    "the second fact is of crucial importance for the analysis of the gev energy breaks because the pass 6 response has a hump starting at 45 gev , which introduces a break in the photon spectrum at energies close to the   lyc absorption ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c454 ] for comparison of the spectra of 3c  454.3 obtained with passes 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the break is not very strong : it changes the index of the power - law by @xmath00.1 .",
    "if one then fits the resulting spectrum with a broken power law , one obtains a significant break .",
    "we believe that the break in the pass 6 effective area is not real , because there is no clear reason for existence of such a feature at this energy .",
    "moreover , it looks strange that the hump appears only in the effective area of the front detector .",
    "the pass 7 version of the effective area does not have such a feature and looks more natural .",
    "the energy - dependent exposure function was calculated using the spacecraft pointing history : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time interval of interest , @xmath8 is the angle between the detector axis and the direction to the object and @xmath9 is the detector effective area at energy @xmath10 .",
    "we accumulated counts in the circle centered at the source location with the energy - dependent radius @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radius of 90% event containment , which was calculated with monte - carlo integration of the point - spread function assuming the isotropic distribution of the exposure angle .",
    "then number of counts in each energy bin was corrected to the containment factor for @xmath13 .    in order to reveal the absorption features in the blazar emission",
    ", we analyzed the spectra of individual bright fsrqs as well as the stacked spectra of various samples .",
    "we have selected a sample of 15 brightest objects from the 2nd fermi catalog @xcite using the following criteria :    1 .   the total number of counts above 1 gev after background subtraction is above 1800 , 2 .",
    "the signal / background ratio exceeds 2 , 3 .",
    "known redshift ( according to the 2nd fermi catalog ) , 4 .",
    "classification as a fsrq , or as a low - synchrotron peak bl  lac if its redshift exceeds 0.5 ( which would mean that the latter is probably a misclassified fsrq ) , 5 .",
    "there is no strong source confusion .",
    "the brightest blazar 3c  454.3 was excluded from the stacking analysis and studied only individually because of its exceptional brightness , which is comparable to the total signal from other selected objects .",
    "the remaining 14 fsrqs bright above 1 gev constitute group 1 , where we hoped to reveal the absorption break at @xmath05 gev associated with   lyc emission @xcite .",
    "we also selected group 2 of eight blazars with the highest number of counts above 5 gev ( more than 200 after background subtraction ) .",
    "this sample was more promising to study h lyc absorption break at @xmath020 gev .",
    "all such blazars also belong to group 1 despite the selection was independent .",

    "we also checked a simpler monochromatic absorber model ( h and  lyc ) , which is less realistic but helps to estimate separate contributions of h and he emission .",
    "we have also constructed two comparison spectra , where breaks are not expected , to make sure that the detection of the breaks is not an artifact of the detector response .",
    "the first one is the stacked redshift - corrected spectrum of four bright bl lacs ( group 3 in table  [ tab : groups ] ) .",
    "the second one is the `` empty '' sky spectrum .",
    "the sky was sliced into 72000 bins of equal area ( @xmath17  str ) and the photons were collected from the bins where number of photons above 100  mev is less that 300 , these bins constitute about 0.226 fraction of the sky . the main contribution to this spectrum is from the high - energy protons producing pions and a smaller contribution of unresolved bl lacs .",
    "statistical errors were treated as gaussian , except in a few bins at higher energies , where the number of photons is low , we use poisson likelihood adding @xmath18 to @xmath4 ( here @xmath19 is the number of counts in the bin and @xmath20 is the prediction of the model ) .",
    "the number of such bins is small and the meaning of @xmath4 is not significantly affected . for the minimization we use the standard code minuit from the cern library .",
    "gamma - ray photons emitted presumably by the relativistic jet emanating from the black hole are strongly beamed .",
    "they propagate through the radiation field made by the accretion disk , the blr and the dusty torus are potentially can be absorbed by photon - photon pair production .",
    "the disk radiation moves nearly parallel to the photon beam and therefore does not interact efficiently .",
    "the infrared photons from the dust absorb radiation mostly in the tev range .",
    "thus , the most important source of opacity is the optical / uv ( nearly ) isotropic radiation from the blr .",
    "the opacity depends on the blr spectrum , which is computed using spectral synthesis code xstar ( version 2.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as described by @xcite .",
    "we repeat here the basic assumption for completeness .",
    "the ionizing spectrum of a quasar is taken as a sum of the standard multi - color accretion disk plus a power law of total luminosity 10% extending to 100 kev @xcite .",
    "the blr clouds are assumed to be simple slabs of constant gas density and a clear view to the ionizing source .",

    "if one assumes a dependence of the cloud density on distance from the black hole @xmath26 , then @xmath27 and our ionization range would correspond to the distance interval between 1 and 0.01 pc to the ionizing source for a quasar luminosity @xmath28  erg  s@xmath29 . in cgs units . ]",
    "the scaling and the estimated distances are very approximate and are model - dependent .    if the blr were to emit only one line at energy @xmath30 , the optical depth for a @xmath1-ray photon of energy @xmath10 through the region of size @xmath31 filled with isotropic soft photon field of column density @xmath32 would be @xmath33 , where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath36 is the line luminosity , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the angle - averaged cross - section for photon - photon pair production ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "contains many lines and recombination continua .",

    "* breaks are not seen in the stacked redshift - corrected bl lac spectrum or the spectrum of the `` empty '' sky . *",
    "the presence of the breaks associated with absorption by uv photons implies that at least some fraction of the @xmath1-rays are produced within the blr .",
    "the presence of  lyc absorption in 3c  454.3 is not surprising .",

    "the blr luminosity is significantly smaller @xmath78  erg  s@xmath29 @xcite with ly@xmath3 producing @xmath79  erg  s@xmath29 , i.e. ten times less than in 3c  454.3 .",
    "a much lower blr luminosity implies that the opacity for 100 gev photons is smaller , because blr size scales roughly as @xmath80  cm @xcite and the opacity as @xmath81 ( see equation ( [ eq : taut ] ) and * ? ? ?",
    "thus in 4c  + 21.35 , the optical depth through the blr is expected to be 57 times smaller than in 3c  454.3 .",
    "this might be the reason why vhe emission is detected in 4c  + 21.35 , but not in a much stronger source 3c  454.3 .    for a given object having both the measurement of the line luminosity and the estimation of the blr size",
    ", we can obtain an expected value for the opacity @xmath47 using equation  ( [ eq : taut ] ) , i.e. assuming that the blr emission is isotropic and @xmath1-rays have to penetrate through the whole blr . for 3c  454.3 with @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ", we get the opacity from h lyc / ly@xmath3 of @xmath84 , while for 4c  + 21.35 we have @xmath85 .",
    "we see , however , for both objects the observed value is @xmath6425 ( table  [ tab : fits ] ) , much below the expectation .",
    "what are the possible solutions for this discrepancy ?",
    "we can propose at least two solutions :    * the size of the h lyc / ly@xmath3 emission region is larger than that measured from reverberation mapping using civ @xcite and h@xmath86 lines @xcite .",
    "we note that no ly@xmath3 variability was detected in any of the quasars analyzed by @xcite supporting this picture .",
    "this would immediately reduce the expected @xmath1-ray opacity , which scales inversely proportionally with the size .",
    "* alternatively , if the blr is flat @xcite , i.e. elongated alone the accretion disk , the @xmath1-ray opacity is much reduced ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the threshold energy , which depends on the maximum interaction angle between the blr photons and the @xmath1-rays , should be a factor of two larger ( i.e. @xmath040 gev instead of @xmath020 gev ) contradicting the data .",
    "however , if in addition a few blr clouds are situated along the jet axis outside the @xmath1-ray emitting region , they would produce enough photons to collide head - on with the @xmath1-rays to make a break at 20 gev .",
    "* finally , the @xmath1-ray emitting region can be extended and its location can change depending on the luminosity , with less gev absorption during the strong flares @xcite .",
    "the vhe emission does not need to be produced in exactly the same place as the gev emission .",
    "this can explain the fact that we see both gev breaks as well as @xmath87100 gev emission in 4c  + 21.35 ( but not necessarily at the same time ) .",
    "how then these models compares with the results on  absorption ?",
    "photoionization models predict that luminosity in  lyc / ly@xmath3 is typically @xmath010% of the hydrogen one @xcite .",
    "thus , taking the same blr size and geometry and using four times larger photon energy gives @xmath88 . in that case",
    ", the  absorption would be negligible .",
    "on the other hand , reverberation mapping shows that   lines are produced closer to the black hole that e.g. h@xmath86 @xcite , implying a higher photon density _ inside _ the zone of complete he ionization and a larger @xmath89 .",
    "however , if the @xmath1-ray emitting region is slightly outside of that region the opacity is reduced . again in this situation the break energy should be higher , but the quality of the data do not allow us to reject a hypothesis that the  break energy is actually two times larger than the fiducial ( rest - frame ) 5 gev value .",
    "thus we do not see an obvious contradiction between the fact that the @xmath1-rays are produced outside ( or at the edge ) of  lyc emitting region and the presence of the break .",
    "in general , the situation with the h lyc absorption strongly dominating over  lyc absorption seems more natural than the picture presented by @xcite and @xcite , where a few gev breaks look more prominent than those at @xmath020 gev .",
    "now the statement of @xcite that the jet emission takes place in the inner ( higher ionization ) regions of blrs should be modified : the gamma - ray emission site lies within the normal  blr region .",
    "this fact does not change the main astrophysical implications of photon - photon absorption of the jet gamma - ray emission , this particularly implies that the jet is already accelerated within a parsec distance from the black hole and therefore the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite is responsible for the jet launching and the blr dense photon field can provide conditions for energy dissipation via photon breeding @xcite ."
