    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be a pair of distinct points in a euclidean plane .",
    "there is a unique line @xmath2 in the plane passing through @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the _ distance _ @xmath3 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 may be defined as the length of the line segment on @xmath2 that connects @xmath0 to @xmath1 , as in figure [ line ] .",
    "if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are any three points in the plane , then @xmath7 this is known as the _ triangle inequality_. if @xmath8 is the triangle with vertices @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , as in figure [ triangle ] , then ( [ triangle inequality ] ) says that the length of the side of @xmath8 connecting @xmath4 to @xmath6 is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides .",
    "a _ metric space _ is a set @xmath9 , which is to say a collection of some sort of objects , for which the distance @xmath3 between any two elements @xmath0 and @xmath1 of @xmath9 has been defined and satisfies certain conditions .",
    "specifically , @xmath10 for every @xmath11 , with @xmath12 exactly when @xmath13 , and the triangle inequality ( [ triangle inequality ] ) should hold for every @xmath14 . thus , ordinary euclidean geometry on a plane is an example of a metric space .",
    "the distance function @xmath3 is also known as a _",
    "metric_. on any set @xmath9 , a metric can be defined by putting @xmath15 when @xmath16 , called the _",
    "discrete metric_. if @xmath17 is a metric space , and @xmath18 is a subset of @xmath9 , then the restriction of @xmath19 to @xmath20 defines a metric on @xmath18 .",
    "the triangle inequality and other requirements of a metric are automatically satisfied on @xmath18 , since they hold on @xmath9 .",
    "the _ real line _ @xmath21 consists of all real numbers , as in figure [ real line ] . if @xmath22 is a real number , then the _ absolute value _ of @xmath22 is denoted @xmath23 and defined by @xmath24 when @xmath25 and @xmath26 when @xmath27 . for every @xmath28 , @xmath29 more precisely , @xmath30 when @xmath22 or @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32 , or when @xmath22 and @xmath31 have the same sign , and otherwise there is some cancellation in @xmath33 .",
    "the standard distance between @xmath22 and @xmath31 can be defined by @xmath34 . in this case",
    ", the triangle inequality reduces to ( [ |r + t| le |r| + |t| ] ) . for if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are arbitrary real numbers , then @xmath35 , and therefore @xmath36 with this metric",
    ", the real line is equivalent to a line in euclidean geometry .",
    "points in a plane can also be described in terms of numbers , using _",
    "cartesian coordinates_. more precisely , a point @xmath0 in the plane can be represented by two real numbers @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the first and second coordinates of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath39 are two points in the plane represented by pairs of numbers in this manner .",
    "the usual euclidean distance @xmath3 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is determined by the formula @xmath40 this follows from the well - known _ pythagorean theorem _ , which states that the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides .",
    "remember that the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite from the right angle . here",
    "we can consider the triangle in the plane whose vertices are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the point corresponding to @xmath41 , as in figure [ cartesian ] .",
    "this is a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the line segment that connects @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and whose other two sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and have lengths @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "one can also look at the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 as in ( [ p = ( p_1 , p_2 ) and q = ( q_1 , q_2 ) ] ) defined by @xmath44 this satisfies the requirements of a metric space too , just like the euclidean distance .",
    "this is not the same as the euclidean distance , because the distance between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is @xmath47 in the euclidean metric , and is equal to @xmath48 with respect to ( [ d(p , q ) = |p_1 - q_1| + |p_2 - q_2| ] ) .",
    "another example is given by @xmath49 which is to say that @xmath50 and @xmath51 one can check that this satisfies the requirements of a metric space as well .",
    "note that the distance between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is equal to @xmath52 with respect to ( [ d(p , q ) = max ( |p_1 - q_1| , |p_2 - q_2| ) ] ) .",
    "the distance between @xmath45 and @xmath53 is equal to @xmath52 with respect to each of these three metrics .",
    "let @xmath0 be a point in the plane , and let @xmath22 be a positive real number .",
    "the usual euclidean circle in the plane with center @xmath0 and radius @xmath22 consists of the points @xmath1 in the plane such that @xmath54 where @xmath3 is the standard euclidean distance , as in figure [ circle ] .",
    "by contrast , the set of points @xmath1 in the plane such that @xmath55 has the shape of a diamond , as in figure [ diamond ] .",
    "similarly , the set of @xmath1 such that @xmath56 is a square , as in figure [ square ] .",
    "the metric @xmath57 is sometimes called the `` taxicab metric '' , because it measures the minimum distance from @xmath0 to @xmath1 along a combination of horizontal and vertical segments , with no diagonal shortcuts . more precisely , it is customary to consider points whose coordinates are whole numbers , and to think of horizontal and vertical lines through these points as being like streets , as in figure [ taxicab ] . note that there can be more than one such path of minimal length between two points .",
    "the same idea can be applied to any collection of points connected by various paths , as in figure [ grid ] .",
    "if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are three of the points , then any route from @xmath4 to @xmath5 can be combined with a route from @xmath5 to @xmath6 to get a route from @xmath4 to @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the distance from @xmath4 to @xmath6 is less than or equal to the sum of the distances from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , since this distance is defined by minimizing the lengths of paths between two points .",
    "thus the triangle inequality holds automatically in this type of situation .",
    "suppose now that @xmath9 is a nice round two - dimensional sphere in ordinary three - dimensional euclidean space . one way to measure distance between points on @xmath9 is to simply use the euclidean distance from the ambient three - dimensional space .",
    "another way is to minimize lengths of paths on @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are distinct points on @xmath9 , then the euclidean distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the same as the length of the line segment connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is not contained in @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that the path on @xmath9 connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 with minimal length is the short arc of a _ great circle _ passing through @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a great circle on a sphere is a circle with the same radius as the sphere , like longitudinal circles through the poles , or the equator .",
    "equivalently , each circle on a sphere is the intersection of the sphere with a plane , and a great circle is the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing through the center of the sphere .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are antipodal points on @xmath9 , then there are infinitely many great circles passing through @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the arcs of these great circles connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 have the same length , which is one - half the circumference of the sphere . otherwise , there is exactly one great circle on @xmath9 passing through @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the shorter arc of this great circle connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the path of minimal length on @xmath9 connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    more generally , if @xmath9 is a nice surface in three - dimensional euclidean space , then one can consider the distance defined by minimizing lengths of paths on @xmath9 between a given pair of points . instead of a flat plane or a round sphere , @xmath9 could be bumpy , like a golf ball .",
    "the shape of a path of minimal length depends on the geometry of the surface , and may not be so simple as a line segment , or a circular arc , or the intersection of @xmath9 with a plane .",
    "there may be many paths of minimal length , as for antipodal points on a sphere .",
    "implicit in the discussion of the case of a sphere is a geometric fact that makes sense already in two dimensions : the length of the short arc of a circle between a fixed pair of points in a euclidean plane decreases as the radius of the circle increases , as in figure [ arcs ] .",
    "one might also say that the curvature of the circle decreases as the radius increases , and that a line is like a circle with infinite radius and curvature zero .",
    "the same principle applies to circular arcs in three dimensions , by rotating an arc so that it lies in the same plane as another arc .",
    "why exactly does the length of a circular arc between two fixed points decrease as the radius of the circle increases ? here are a few ways to look at this question .",
    "it does not matter where the endpoints of the arcs are , and so we can suppose that they correspond to @xmath58 and @xmath52 on the @xmath4-axis",
    ". each circular arc can be described as the graph of a real - valued function on the interval @xmath59 $ ] , and one can check that the magnitude of the slope of the tangent to a point on such an arc over a particular point in the interval decreases as the radius of the circle increases .",
    "this is pretty clear from the picture , and it implies that the length of the arc decreases as the radius increases .    alternatively , we can reformulate the original statement by saying that the distance between two points on the unit circle divided by the length of the shorter arc between them increases as the points move closer together .",
    "one can see that this is equivalent to the previous version by rescaling the picture .",
    "the length of the shorter arc determines an angle @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the distance between the two points is equal to @xmath62 .",
    "thus one would like to show that @xmath63 is monotone decreasing when @xmath64 , which can be treated as an exercise in calculus .",
    "note that @xmath65 can be included using the continuous extension of the ratio equal to @xmath52 there .    as a another approach ,",
    "let @xmath66 be a circle in the plane with center @xmath6 , and let @xmath18 be the set of points on @xmath66 or in the exterior of @xmath66 . by definition , the _ circular projection _ sends a point @xmath67 in the plane to the element of @xmath66 on the line segment connecting @xmath0 to @xmath6 . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are elements of @xmath18 , then the distance between their projections in @xmath66 is less than or equal to their distance in the plane . in terms of vector calculus",
    ", the differential of the circular projection at any point @xmath68 corresponds to a linear mapping that does not increase the euclidean norm of a vector .",
    "this implies that the length of any curve in @xmath18 with endpoints on @xmath66 is greater than or equal to the length of the shorter arc of @xmath66 with the same endpoints , and applies in particular to circular arcs with endpoints on @xmath66 associated to circles of smaller radius .",
    "let @xmath9 be the unit sphere in three - dimensional euclidean space , consisting of points whose distance to the origin is equal to @xmath52 , and let @xmath3 be the ordinary euclidean distance between any two points @xmath11 .",
    "for each @xmath11 , @xmath69 , and there is a unique @xmath70 $ ] such that @xmath71 equivalently , @xmath72 is the length of the shorter arc of a great circle on the unit sphere passing through @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to show that this defines a metric on @xmath9",
    ", we need to check that the triangle inequality @xmath73 holds for every @xmath74 .",
    "consider the set @xmath75 of @xmath76 with @xmath77 which is the same as @xmath78 thus @xmath75 is a circle , which reduces to a single point in the trivial cases where @xmath1 and @xmath22 are equal or antipodal .",
    "let @xmath79 be the point in @xmath75 such that @xmath80 for each @xmath81 , which is the same as @xmath82 for every @xmath83 .",
    "one can show that @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath79 lie on a great circle , as in the next paragraph .",
    "the triangle inequality holds for points on a great circle , which is to say that @xmath84 therefore @xmath85 as desired .",
    "one can also check that equality holds in the triangle inequality only for points on a great circle .    in a euclidean plane ,",
    "the distance between a point @xmath4 and elements of a circle is maximized and minimized on the intersection of the circle with the line through @xmath4 and the center of the circle .",
    "the same holds for a point and a sphere in three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "suppose that we have a point @xmath4 and a circle in three - dimensional euclidean space , where @xmath4 is not on the plane of the circle .",
    "let @xmath86 be the projection of @xmath4 onto the plane of the circle , which is to say that the line through @xmath4 and @xmath86 is perpendicular to the plane of the circle .",
    "the distance from @xmath4 to an element of the circle can be expressed in terms of the distance from @xmath4 to @xmath86 and the distance from @xmath86 to the point in question , by the pythagorean theorem .",
    "maximizing or minimizing the distance from the circle to @xmath4 is hence the same as maximizing or minimizing the distance to @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the maximum and minimum occur on the intersection of the circle with the line through @xmath86 and the center of the circle , since @xmath86 is on the plane of the circle . in terms of @xmath4 ,",
    "the maximum and minimum occur on the plane passing through @xmath4 and the center of the circle which is perpendicular to the circle .",
    "for the problem in spherical geometry in the previous paragraph , the euclidean center of the circle @xmath75 is on the line passing through @xmath1 and the origin , and the plane of @xmath75 is perpendicular to this line .",
    "the plane that contains the origin , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 also contains the euclidean center of @xmath75 and is perpendicular to the plane of @xmath75 , and so the distance from @xmath0 to elements of @xmath75 is maximized and minimized on the intersection of this plane with @xmath75 .",
    "thus the maximum and minimum occur on a great circle through @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    by construction , @xmath87 for every @xmath11 .",
    "the distances are practically the same locally , in the sense that for every @xmath88 there is a @xmath89 such that @xmath90 when @xmath91 , because @xmath92 this means that the two metrics are the same `` infinitesimally '' at each point , and in particular that the length of a path in @xmath9 is the same relative to either metric .",
    "one can use this to show that arcs of great circles with length @xmath93 are the paths of minimal length , since the length of a path is always greater than or equal to the distance between its endpoints .",
    "hence the spherical metric @xmath72 is the same as the metric defined by minimizing lengths of paths in this case .",
    "let @xmath66 be a nice smooth curve in the plane , as in figure [ curve ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath66 is _ simple _",
    ", i.e. , without crossings . it may be that @xmath66 is bounded , like a line segment or circular arc , or unbounded , like a line or ray .",
    "as in the previous section , the distance between two points @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath66 might be measured using the euclidean metric from the plane , or using the length of the arc on @xmath66 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is the path of minimal length on @xmath66 connecting @xmath0 to @xmath1 , which is more complicated on a surface , since the paths can move around more . as usual ,",
    "the euclidean distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is less than or equal to the length of the arc on @xmath66 between them .",
    "normally the inequality is strict , because of curvature . with respect to the distance defined by the length of arcs , @xmath66 looks flat . using a parameterization of @xmath66 by arc length , as in vector calculus",
    ", @xmath66 looks the same as if it were contained in a line relative to this distance .",
    "thus @xmath66 may be intrinsically flat even if it is extrinsically curved .",
    "however , surfaces are typically curved intrinsically as well as extrinsically .",
    "if @xmath2 is a line in a euclidean plane and @xmath0 is a point in the plane not on @xmath2 , then there is exactly one line @xmath94 in the plane passing through @xmath0 and parallel to @xmath2 .",
    "this is the famous _ parallel postulate _ in euclidean geometry .",
    "a well - known question asked whether the parallel postulate could be derived from the other postulates .",
    "eventually it was discovered that this is not possible , because there are non - euclidean geometries in which the parallel postulate does not work while the other postulates hold .",
    "one of these is based on spherical geometry , with great circles playing the role of lines .",
    "more precisely , it is better to use projective space , where antipodal points in the sphere are identified . in this case",
    ", the problem with the parallel postulate is that great circles always intersect . in _ hyperbolic geometry _",
    ", the problem with the parallel postulate is that there is more than one line through a point @xmath0 that is parallel to a fixed line not containing @xmath0 .",
    "hyperbolic geometry can also be represented by a metric space , where arcs of `` lines '' minimize length and determine distance .",
    "a basic question that one might ask about a metric space is what kind of symmetry it has . on the real line , for example , there are symmetries by translation . for each real number @xmath95",
    ", one can translate every element of @xmath21 by @xmath95 without changing the distances . for if @xmath96 , then @xmath97 for every @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 for every @xmath98 .",
    "this is the reflection of @xmath21 about @xmath32 , and the reflection of @xmath21 about any other point preserves distances too .",
    "the reflection about any other point can also be expressed in terms of @xmath101 and suitable translations .",
    "translation symmetries on the plane can be described similarly in coordinates by @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "reflection about the origin can be given by @xmath104 one can reflect about the axes independently , as in @xmath105 and @xmath106 or about the line @xmath107 , as in @xmath108 a remarkable feature of euclidean geometry is that the metric is preserved by arbitrary rotations . this does not work for the metrics @xmath57 and @xmath109 defined in section [ back to plane ] , although translations and the reflections just mentioned preserve these metrics .    for a two - dimensional round sphere in three - dimensional euclidean space , there are symmetries by rotation about the center of the sphere .",
    "one can reflect about the center of the sphere , or about any plane through the center of the sphere .",
    "as in the previous examples , these symmetries are sufficient to move any point in the space to any other point in the space .",
    "let @xmath17 be a metric space . for each @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    ", @xmath112 denotes the _ open ball _ in @xmath9 with center @xmath0 and radius @xmath22 , defined by @xmath113 in the real line with the standard metric , this is the same as the open interval @xmath114 . in a euclidean plane , @xmath112 is a round disk .    if @xmath115 and @xmath116 , then @xmath117 as in figure [ inclusion ] . for if @xmath4 is any element of @xmath118 , then @xmath119 , and @xmath120 by the triangle inequality .",
    "thus @xmath121 , as desired .",
    "more precisely , figure [ inclusion ] shows a euclidean plane and is suggestive of the general case ."
