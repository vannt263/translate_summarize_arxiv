    "the discovery of new structures in liquid crystals turns out to be often associated with an increase of complexity .",
    "smectic blue phases are the most recent example combining the properties of two types of frustrated mesophases : twist grain boundary ( tgb ) phases and blue phases ( bp ) .",
    "blue phases , which were the first reported liquid crystals @xcite , show an unusual cubic symmetry in which the orientational order is periodic and long range in three dimensions @xcite . thus blue phases are exemplary _ liquid crystals _ :",
    "bps exhibit three - dimensional cubic faceted monodomains as in a crystal @xcite , but the order at the origin of the cubic symmetry is not a positional order , but an orientational one .",
    "the naming of these phases as _ blue _ is due to their bragg reflections in the visible range ( and therefore also in the blue wavelengths ) indicating a spatially periodic structure with lattice parameters of several hundreds nm .",
    "saupe was the first to suggest a chiral cubic structure from the bps optical activity and their lack of birefringence ( @xmath1n=0 ) @xcite .",
    "the bp s structure involves a radial twist of the director called a double cylinder .",
    "however this double twisted structure can not extend perfectly into three - dimensional space .",
    "geometrical models of blue phases therefore consist of cubic networks of double twist cylinders separated by disclination lines ( fig .",
    "[ figbp ] ) .    twist grain boundary ( tgb ) phases represent a second example of a frustrated chiral system .",
    "tgb phases were predicted by renn and lubensky @xcite and were experimentally observed by goodby _",
    "et al . _ in 1989 for tgb@xmath2 @xcite and by nguyen _ et al . _ in 1992 for tgb@xmath3 @xcite . since smectic layers can not be continuously twisted , the tgb phases consist of blocks of pure smectic material ( which can be either smectic - a for tgb@xmath2 or smectic - c for tgb@xmath3 ) separated by parallel , regularly spaced grain boundaries , formed by a periodic array of screw dislocations ( fig .",
    "[ figtgb ] ) .",
    "such a dislocation arrangement allows helical twist .",
    "thus , in tgb phases , as in blue phases , the frustration is relieved by the presence of defects .",
    "+    in the last few years the bordeaux group has synthesized new chiral liquid crystals exhibiting mesophases called smectic blue phases ( bp@xmath0 ) , which appear in a very narrow temperature range ( fig .",
    "[ dsc ] ) with the following phase sequence : tgb - bp@xmath01 - bp@xmath02 - bp@xmath03 - iso , without any intermediate cholesteric state between the bp@xmath0 and tgb phases @xcite .",
    "the evidence of a new phase sequence has stimulated further experimental studies by the orsay group mainly based on optical techniques ( polarizing microscopy and optical activity measurements ) and on x - ray scattering from bp@xmath0 monodomains .",
    "one of the first experiments to characterize mesophases is to observe their texture under the polarizing microscope .",
    "the results of such an experiment are reported in figs .",
    "[ birefringencebpsm2 ] and [ texturebpsma1 ] providing some important information on the bp@xmath0 structure .",
    "when cooling from the isotropic phase , two smectic blue phases with detectable textures occur in a narrow temperature span ( about 1 @xmath4c ) : bp@xmath02 and bp@xmath01 .",
    "the third smectic blue phase ( bp@xmath03 ) has , like the classical bp3 phase @xcite , an amorphous structure of the same macroscopic symmetry as the isotropic phase @xcite . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ birefringencebpsm2 ] , a mosaic texture composed of gray platelets is observed for bp@xmath02 .",
    "this texture looks on first view very similar to the one of classical blue phases  ; however what is the origin of the lack of bright colors observed in smectic blue phases ? in bp s , the mosaic texture comes from selective bragg reflections at visible wavelengths from domains with different orientations . in bp@xmath02",
    "the existence of modulation in colors from light gray to black is due to a completely different optical feature : the birefringence @xcite .",
    "bp@xmath02 phase is thus optically anisotropic and the evidence of a non - cubic symmetry proves that smectic blue phases are really new mesophases , not merely `` atypical '' blue phases .",
    "contrary to the gray color of the bp@xmath02 phase , the blue color of the bp@xmath01 phase shown in fig .",
    "[ texturebpsma1 ] originates from its optical activity ; this can only be seen in absence of high birefringence @xcite . moreover , in smectic blue phases the lattice parameter is in the near uv - range , and is therefore too small to generate selective reflections of visible light as in the bp s @xcite .",
    "the bp@xmath0 lattice parameter has been measured by studying the wavelength dependence of the optical activity in bp@xmath01 .",
    "a divergence of the optical activity is expected close to the selective reflection , @xmath5@xmath6 , as has already been seen in the cholesteric phase and in the classical blue phases .",
    "the data for the `` 14btmhc '' compound are plotted in fig .",
    "[ c14lambda ] , showing a rise of the optical activity when the wavelength decreases .",
    "a fit allows an estimate of the bp@xmath0 lattice parameter : p=0.21 @xmath7 with @xmath5@xmath6=320 nm and n=1.5 .",
    "the value of the bp@xmath0 lattice parameter in the uv range prevents study by optical scattering of visible light ( kossel diagram technique ) , which has been used to determine the symmetry of classical blue phases @xcite .",
    "therefore , other ways had to be found to study the orientational symmetries of smectic blue phases , such as the growth of faceted crystallites .",
    "the nucleation and growth of such single faceted crystals of bp@xmath0 phases represents a real experimental challenge . using a low cooling rate ( 0.01 @xmath4c per 10 min ) to produce large monodomains gives rise to the birefringent platelet texture ( fig .",
    "[ birefringencebpsm2 ] ) that quickly fills the entire experimental cell .",
    "however , by using the metastability of the bp@xmath03 phase occurring in some compounds , we succeeded in producing large faceted crystallites of the bp@xmath02 phase @xcite .",
    "this kind of experiment is difficult because it is performed out of equilibrium in a very narrow temperature range ( 0.15 @xmath4c ) .",
    "different crystalline shapes have been listed , as reported in figs .",
    "[ a3 ] to [ a6 ] . these large monocrystals , between 100 and 150 @xmath7 in size and with well - defined facets , have been observed floating in the bulk in coexistence with the isotropic supercooled bp@xmath03 phase . on each picture",
    ", the white cross represents the positions of the crossed polarizers needed to assure _ extinction _ of the birefringent domains , i.e. , it represents the projection ( or the normal direction ) of the optical axis in the observation plane .",
    "the three - dimensional polyhedral habit of the bp@xmath02 monocrystals shown in figs .",
    "[ a3 ] to [ a6 ] seems close to a rhombic dodecahedron , which has already been observed for classical cubic blue phase @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental crystallites can not reproduce a perfect rhombic dodecahedron because their birefringence is incompatible with a cubic structure .",
    "thus , the data of the birefringent faceted monodomains suggest that the crystal habit of the bp@xmath02 phase is formed by a dodecahedral structure made from an orthorhombic unit cell ( fig . [ orthorhombic ] ) .",
    "this interpretation of an orthorhombic symmetry is also consistent with the x - ray scattering experiments and especially with the epitaxial relation observed at the transition from bp@xmath02 to bp@xmath01 phases @xcite .",
    "the new phase sequence ( tgb - bp@xmath0 - iso ) has stimulated x - ray scattering studies , especially to investigate whether the smectic order existing in the tgb phases persists in smectic blue phases .",
    "the experiments show that the bp@xmath0 phases exhibit , contrary to bps , quasi - long - range smectic order with a typical persistence length of about 60 nm .",
    "information on the symmetry of these new phases has then been obtained in growing bp@xmath0 monodomains to explore the entire reciprocal space @xcite .",
    "the scattering patterns obtained exhibit pairs of `` bragg peaks '' indicating that the smectic order is not isotropic , but extends in given directions of the three - dimensional unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ rx - pattern ] ) . by combining these various profiles ,",
    "the directions of smectic order enhancement i.e. those in which the different `` bragg peaks '' are located , have been determined and the angles between these directions have been deduced , providing the symmetry of each bp@xmath0 phase .",
    "it is important to note here that the bragg scattering is not due to the periodicity of the orientational order , which is at the length scale of the unit cell ( about 200 nm , the dimension of the lattice parameter ) ( fig .",
    "[ c14lambda ] ) @xcite .",
    "only the smectic order has been probed , defined by a periodicity of 4 nm and a correlation length of about 60 nm , three times smaller than the size of the unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ rx - pattern ] ) .",
    "therefore , these x - ray scattering experiments only provide _ indirect _ information on the symmetry of the orientational unit cell , contrary to the faceted monocrystals of the bp@xmath02 phase .    these results by x - ray scattering point to the main unsolved theoretical question dealing with smectic blue phases : why does the smectic order break the cubic symmetry of blue phases ?",
    "the first theoretical approach for combining smectic order with three - dimensional orientational order was proposed by kamien @xcite with a model of smectic double twist cylinders linking smectic a order and twist not only in one direction as in tgb phases , but in two spatial directions ( fig .",
    "[ kamienmodel ] ) .",
    "the smectic double twist cylinder is the counterpart in the smectic blue phases of the double twist cylinder in the bp s .",
    "our experimental results can be interpreted in terms of this geometrical model by assuming that the regions where the smectic order easily extends , are the smectic double twist cylinders cores and correspond to the `` bragg peaks '' in fig .",
    "[ rx - pattern ] .",
    "a geometrical model of the structure of smectic blue phases can be sketched by packing these smectic double twist cylinders according to the observed symmetries @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus some topological defects exist both _ in _ the smectic double twist cylinder for combining twist and smectic order , and _ between _ the cylinders as in blue phases .    recently",
    "another geometrical model based on minimal surfaces has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "in the same way as a classical blue phase can be seen as the three - dimensional counterpart of the cholesteric phase , a smectic blue phase can be regarded as the extension to 3d of the tgb phase .",
    "indeed , contrary to the cholesteric and to the blue phases where the twist occurs at the `` molecular level '' , the twist occurs at the scale of the smectic slabs for both tgb and smectic blue phases .",
    "thus smectic blue phases represent an original physical system of condensed matter exhibiting a _ double frustration _ : the extension of chirality in three spatial dimensions , and helical twist competing with smectic order ."
