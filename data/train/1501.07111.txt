    "early - type galaxies ( etgs ) are embedded in hot gaseous haloes produced mainly by stellar winds , and heated to x - ray temperatures by type ia supernovae ( snia ) explosions and by the thermalization of stellar motions @xcite .",
    "the thermalization is due to the interaction between the stellar and snia ejecta and the pre - existing hot ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent high resolution 2d hydrodynamical simulations of hot gas flows ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter n14 ) showed that the presence of ordered rotation in the stellar component can alter significantly the ism evolution with respect to that shown by fully velocity dispersion supported systems of same total mass and mass distribution .",
    "firstly , it is found that the rotation field of the ism in rotating galaxies is very similar to that of the stars , with a consequent negligible heating contribution from thermalization of the ordered motions .",
    "secondly , conservation of angular momentum in the ism of rotating galaxies results in the formation of a centrifugally supported cold equatorial disc , with the consequent reduction of both the x - ray luminosity @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 of the hot ism .",
    "these results compared well with observations , which show a dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the galactic shape and internal dynamics : @xmath0 is observed to be high only in round and slowly rotating galaxies , and is limited to lower values for flatter , fast rotating ones @xcite ; @xmath1 of slowly rotating systems is consistent just with the thermalization of the stellar random kinetic energy , estimated from @xmath3 ( the stellar velocity dispersion averaged within one effective radius @xmath4 ) , while fast rotating systems show @xmath1 values below 0.4  kev , and not scaling with @xmath5 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "a major outcome of the previous simulations is that cold material can be accumulated in considerable amounts , during the lifetime of rotating galaxies .",
    "the cold gas typically settles in the equatorial plane , where it forms an extended disc ( of 0.510 kpc radius ) , that can be as massive as @xmath6 m@xmath7 , in the largest galaxies .",
    "this result brings in a few important questions : are these cold discs observed ?",
    "do they become , as seems natural , a site for star formation ( hereafter sf ) ? is sf observed ? and what is the impact of sf in the disc on @xmath0 and @xmath1 ? in recent years evidence",
    "has been accumulating that etgs host significant quantities of cold gas , in the form of atomic and molecular hydrogen @xcite ; approximately 50% of massive etgs ( of stellar mass @xmath8m@xmath7 ) contain @xmath9 to @xmath10 m@xmath7 of hi and/or h@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a large , systematic investigation of the atlas@xmath12 sample of etgs with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope found that @xmath13% of galaxies outside virgo , and @xmath14% of galaxies inside it , are detected in hi , with @xmath15m@xmath7 ; the majority ( 2/3 ) of the detections consists of settled configurations , where the cold gas is in discs or rings .",
    "small discs ( size of a few kpc ) , confined within the stellar body , share the same kinematics of the stars ; large discs ( up to @xmath16 m@xmath7 ) extend to tens of kpc , and in half of the cases are kinematically misaligned with the stars @xcite . in particular ,",
    "fast - rotating virgo galaxies have kinematically aligned gas , and the most massive ( @xmath17m@xmath7 ) fast - rotating etgs always have kinematically aligned gas , independent of environment ; this alignment leads to hypothesize that the gas has been internally generated @xcite .",
    "the hi discs / rings around slowly - rotating etgs , instead , are usually not fully settled , which suggests an external origin ( in mergers , or in accretion from satellite galaxies , or from the intergalactic medium ) ; an external origin was considered likely also for those etgs showing stellar / gas kinematic misalignment .",
    "interestingly , while hi is more ubiquitous , molecular gas is detected only in fast rotators across the entire atlas@xmath18 sample @xcite .    besides giving indication about its origin through its morphology and kinematics",
    ", the observed cold gas seems also to provide material for sf .",
    "low level sf activity is present in @xmath19 one - third of etgs @xcite ; @xcite showed ongoing sf signatures in the optical spectra of at least @xmath20% of nearby etgs . in the atlas@xmath12 sample ,",
    "galaxies with hi within @xmath21 1 @xmath22 exhibit ongoing sf in @xmath23% of the cases , @xmath24 times more frequently than galaxies without hi @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as for molecular gas , some degree of sf and young stellar populations are detected only in fast rotators , in the atlas@xmath12 sample @xcite .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy showed that etgs host frequently a rotating stellar component younger and more metal rich than the bulge @xcite .",
    "the presence of this component , and the occurrence of sf , imply an important role for the cold gas during the evolution of etgs @xcite .",
    "finally , the cold gas content of etgs is also an important prediction of @xmath25cdm hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation , that include cold gas evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and accretion via various processes during the secular evolution of galaxies ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in conclusion",
    ", the cold gas has become a tool to gain insight into recent ( and less recent ) galaxy evolution . in order to correctly interpret the variety of observational results , and to use them properly as constraints for different scenarios for the origin of the structure and sf history of etgs ,",
    "it is crucial to establish what is the relative importance of the various gas production processes ( internal and external to galaxies ) , gas depletion ones ( agn and sf - driven outflows , environmental stripping ) , and gas consumption ones ( sf ) .",
    "cold gas is usually thought to come from accretion from the surrounding medium or satellites , as well as from gas - rich mergers ; in the cases of the giant central - dominant galaxies in groups or clusters it can also come from cooling of hot gas @xcite .",
    "the numerical investigation of n14 showed an additional _ internal _ contribution of cold gas , coming from the evolution of the passive stellar population , that can be substantial , or even too large with respect to observed values .",
    "a natural sequel of the n14 work should address the questions of whether this gas can possibly lead to sf , when sf takes place , and what is the fate of the cold discs , whether they are consumed or they are continuously replenished by cooling hot gas . in this paper",
    "we add sf to the simulations of n14 , and we explore the ism evolution including the removal of cold gas , and the injection of mass , momentum and energy appropriate for the newly ( and continuously ) forming stellar population . in this way we aim at establishing whether i )",
    "the n14 results for the general trends of the hot gas properties with galaxy shape and stellar kinematics still hold ; ii ) the formation of stars can reduce the amount of cold gas in the simulations , thus bringing it more in agreement with observed values ; iii ) a significant channel for sf , previously neglected , should be taken into consideration for rotating systems , and whether this can account for the low level sf activity currently seen to be ongoing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the main ingredients of the simulations , such as the galaxy models and the input physics . in section 3",
    "we present and discuss the results of the simulations .",
    "in section 4 we summarize the conclusions .",
    "n14 performed a large set of 2d hydrodynamical simulations with the zeus mp2 code to fully explore the large parameter space of realistic ( axisymmetric ) galaxy models , characterized by different stellar mass , intrinsic flattening , distribution of dark matter , and internal kinematics .",
    "the galaxy flattening was either fully supported by ordered rotation , originating the set of models that are isotropic rotators , or by tangential anisotropy , originating the set of fully velocity dispersion supported models .",
    "these two extreme configurations were built adopting the satoh decomposition , respectively with satoh parameter @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the galaxy models were tailored to reproduce the observed properties and scaling laws of early type galaxies ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . in this work",
    "we perform hydrodynamical simulations for a representative subset of rotating models already investigated by n14 ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) , including sf in the simulations ( as described in sect .",
    "2.2 below ) , but keeping the code ( numerical set - up , grid properties ) in all equal to that used by n14 ( see n14 for details ) .",
    "also , a less extreme value of @xmath28 is explored .",
    "a logarithmically spaced numerical mesh @xmath29 of 960@xmath30480 gridpoints is employed , with a resolution of 90 pc in the first 10 kpc from the centre ."
