    "noncommutative geometry @xcite is a vast generalization of differential geometry to the quantum world . however , many of its successful applications are in ordinary , commutative differential geometry . for instance",
    ", it turned out that kasparov s bivariant @xmath2-theory provided the right context for index theory which naturally extends to foliations @xcite . here",
    ", a central role is played by the shriek or wrong - way map @xmath3 associated to any ( @xmath2-oriented ) smooth map @xmath4 between smooth manifolds .",
    "it is an element in the bivariant @xmath2-theory @xmath5 of kasparov @xcite and is defined using the principal symbol of a suitably defined pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to @xcite ( and @xcite for the general case of maps between foliations ) for full details . for the special case that @xmath7 is a point",
    "the shriek map is the fundamental class @xmath8 $ ] of the manifold in the @xmath2-homology group @xmath9 .",
    "the wrong - way functoriality of the shriek map was stated as a problem in @xcite and proven in @xcite .",
    "it says that for two maps @xmath10 and @xmath11 we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the internal kasparov product in @xmath1-theory .",
    "now , for the special case that @xmath14 consist of a single point , this implies that the fundamental class of @xmath15 factorizes in @xmath1-theory as follows : @xmath16 = f !",
    "\\hot_{c(y ) } [ y].\\ ] ] moreover , if @xmath4 is a submersion , the shriek map @xmath17 can equivalently be described by a family of pseudodifferential operators of order zero acting on the fibers of @xmath18 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.9 ) .",
    "a natural first question that arises is whether ( and under which conditions ) one can explicitly find unbounded @xmath1-cycles ( as introduced in the early 1980s by connes and baaj  julg in @xcite ) that represent the respective classes @xmath8 , [ y]$ ] and @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath7 are spin@xmath0 manifolds , it is clear @xcite that the dirac operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the corresponding fundamental classes .",
    "moreover , if @xmath21 is a riemannian submersion , one expects that there is a family of dirac operators @xmath22 on the fibers @xmath23 ( for all @xmath24 ) that gives an unbounded representative of the class @xmath3 in @xmath5 .",
    "the immediate next question is then whether we can write the factorization formula as a tensor sum of these unbounded @xmath1-cycles , that is to say , whether in some sense @xmath25 with @xmath26 a suitable connection on the bundle of vertical spinors .",
    "even though the above are natural questions , and their affirmative answers appear to be folklore to practitioners of ( unbounded ) @xmath1-theory , we have not found a detailed written account on it in the literature .",
    "of course , the bounded @xmath1-cycles that enter @xcite are very much differential in nature and essentially already dictate the form of the corresponding unbounded @xmath1-cycles .",
    "the work of bismut @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) and ( * ? ? ? * chapter 4 ) ) comes very close , at least in spirit , but does not connect to @xmath1-theory ( even though that would provide the right context for the atiyah  singer index theorem for families ) .",
    "also , the mere existence of the unbounded @xmath1-cycles and the validity of the tensor sum as an unbounded representative of the internal kasparov product would follow from @xcite . there , the authors work with the unbounded form of the internal @xmath1-product that was the topic of @xcite and use a theorem by kucerovsky @xcite to check if an unbounded @xmath1-cycle is a representative of the internal product of ( the bounded classes of ) two other unbounded @xmath1-cycles . without questioning the power of their approach , the geometric context sketched above makes it most natural to explicitly construct the unbounded @xmath1-cycles in terms of ( families of ) dirac operators and establish for them an explicit tensor sum decomposition as in equation [ eq : tensor - sum ] .",
    "moreover , as we will see below ( theorem [ thm : fact ] ) there is an obstruction to having an exact factorization of unbounded @xmath1-cycles given by a ( bounded ) curvature form .",
    "in fact , this is the key point of working with unbounded @xmath1-cycles instead of merely their homotopy classes in bounded @xmath1-theory : one captures the metric aspect of the geometry which is encoded by an unbounded operator . from this point of view",
    "it is thus not surprising that curvature enters in the ( unbounded product ) formula for submersions .    in this paper",
    ", we will present in full detail the construction of an unbounded representative for @xmath17 in the case of a riemannian submersion @xmath27 of spin@xmath0 manifolds @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is given by a family of dirac operators on the fibers of @xmath30 and is defined in terms of a vertical clifford connection acting on a vertical clifford module .",
    "after we have shown that the tensor product of the vertical clifford module with the hilbert space of @xmath31-spinors on @xmath29 is unitarily equivalent to the hilbert space of @xmath31-spinors on @xmath28 , we state our main result in theorem [ thm : fact ] .",
    "we establish that the tensor sum @xmath32 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath33 , up to an explicit ( bounded ) curvature term .",
    "as already mentioned , such a curvature term can not be obtained by analyzing the bounded @xmath1-product , but only arises as an obstruction to having an exact factorization of unbounded @xmath1-cycles .",
    "we exemplify our results by homogeneous spaces for simply - connected compact semisimple lie groups .",
    "note that this class and the corresponding factorization in @xmath1-theory is also being studied in @xcite . as a special case in this class",
    "we obtain the factorization in @xmath1-theory of the dirac operator on the total space of the hopf fibration which was previously obtained in @xcite .",
    "we also explain the term @xmath34 that appeared in the tensor sum in _ loc .",
    "_ as coming from the curvature of the hopf fibration .",
    "finally , our construction generalizes the projectability results on circle and torus principal bundles of @xcite and the @xmath1-factorization results of torus principal bundles of @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank alain connes and nigel higson for useful suggestions .",
    "we are grateful to simon brain , bram mesland and adam rennie for fruitful discussions .",
    "the first author also wants to thank matthias lesch for a sequence of inspiring conversations back in 2012 concerning the possibility of applying unbounded @xmath1-theory techniques in the context of fiber bundles .",
    "we start by giving a brief overview of riemannian submersions , referring to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iii.d ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10.1 ) for more details .",
