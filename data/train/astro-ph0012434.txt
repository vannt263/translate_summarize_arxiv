    "many authors have pointed out that mass pick - up from embedded clumps can significantly modify the structures of a wide variety of astrophysical flows .",
    "these include , for example , mckee & ostriker ( @xcite ) in their theory of the interstellar medium , hartquist ( @xcite ) in the study of wind blown nebulae , and chize & lazareff ( @xcite ) , cowie , mckee & ostriker ( @xcite ) and dyson & hartquist ( @xcite ) in the study of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "observations of wind - blown bubbles ( wbbs ) ( smith @xcite ; meaburn @xcite ) have led to the conclusion that the interactions of the winds with clumps of stellar material ejected during prior stages of mass - loss greatly affect the structure and evolution of the bubbles ( see williams , hartquist & dyson @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , a number of numerical investigations of this process have been conducted .",
    "detailed one - dimensional , time dependent hydrodynamic models of specific wbbs have been constructed by arthur , dyson & hartquist ( @xcite , @xcite ) and arthur , henney & dyson ( @xcite ) .",
    "numerical solutions for the mach numbers of steady mass - loaded winds have been presented by williams ( @xcite ) , and studies of steady hydromagnetic mass - loaded winds have been performed by williams , dyson , & hartquist ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we derive similarity solutions for the structures and evolution of mass - loaded wbbs .",
    "this work complements that on similarity solutions for snrs obtained by chize & lazareff ( @xcite ) and dyson & hartquist ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we consider a constant _ rate _ of energy input , @xmath5 , rather than a constant _ total _ energy , and assume that the mass - loading occurs due to conductively driven evaporation .",
    "the solutions are potentially relevant to wbbs created by a fast wind interacting with a clumpy agb superwind , by the wind of a young high - mass star interacting with surrounding molecular material , and the wind of an active galactic nucleus impacting its environment .",
    "the evaporation of spherical clouds by hot gas has been analyzed by cowie & mckee ( @xcite ) and mckee & cowie ( @xcite ) . if the mean free path for electron - electron energy change in the ambient gas is less than about half of the radius of a clump , the mass evaporation rate from an individual clump scales as @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is the temperature of the material surrounding the clump . for a typical jump of @xmath7 at the reverse shock",
    "( corresponding to a post - shock temperature of @xmath8  k ) , and a clump electron number density of @xmath9 , the mean free path for electron energy exchange is @xmath10  cm .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the lengthscale of a clump ( in a planetary nebula , meaburn @xcite ) , so the assumption of unsaturated conduction with a @xmath6 temperature dependence of @xmath11 , the mass evaporation rate per unit volume , should be reasonable throughout most of the mass - loading region if mass - loading is significant .",
    "we also assume that the clumps are stationary with respect to the star , and that they are also cold and dense .",
    "therefore the clumps have neither kinetic or internal energy , and the picked - up mass is thus injected at zero velocity .",
    "the stripped mass then acquires momentum and energy from the general more tenuous flow .",
    "hence the only source term in the hydrodynamic equations is @xmath11 .",
    "in addition we assume that at any given point the injected mass reaches the general flow velocity and temperature instantaneously that the characteristic scale length of the mixing region is much smaller than the dimensions of the bubble .",
    "we also assume that the clumps are sufficiently numerous that they can be considered continuously distributed such that a hydrodynamic treatment applies .",
    "we suppose that conductive energy transport can be neglected in the energy equation describing the global evolution of the wbb .",
    "the wbbs are assumed to evolve adiabatically , whilst the swept - up interclump medium is assumed to catastrophically cool into a thin dense shell .",
    "the clumps are assumed to pass through this shell without any interaction , and then on into the region of shocked stellar wind .",
    "the unshocked stellar wind is assumed to have a flow speed much greater than its thermal speed .",
    "hence its thermal energy is negligible with respect to its kinetic energy , and since no mass - loading occurs in this region , we ignore the energy equation for this part of the flow .",
    "finally we assume that any external forces , such as gravity or radiation pressure , are negligible .",
    "a schematic of the flow topology is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",

    "induced mass - loading , the evaporation of the clumps only occurs in the ssw region . in the usw region",
    "we assume no interaction between the clumps and the fast stellar wind .",
    "let the interclump medium have a density of the form @xmath15 , and let us consider the case where the mass - loading rate is also radially dependent : @xmath16 .",
    "the problem as its stands has five parameters with independent dimensions , namely @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the rate of energy input by the stellar wind @xmath5 .",

    "we first consider similarity solutions obtained by dyson & de vries ( @xcite ) and dyson ( @xcite ) .",
    "these earlier works concerned the dynamical effects of a high velocity stellar wind incident on a smooth ambient medium and contain no results for mass - loaded flows .",
    "dyson & de vries originally computed the form of the shocked ambient gas behind the forward shock by parameterizing the cooling function , which demanded that the ambient density , @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "they discovered that the shocked ambient gas cooled rapidly , and that this region was very thin compared with the overall radius of the bubble .",
    "therefore , dyson ( @xcite ) discarded the shocked ambient region in favour of a strong isothermal shock coincident with the contact discontinuity , which relieved the restriction on @xmath125 .",
    "a central assumption for both papers was that the velocity of the stellar wind was constant , which led to the stellar mass - loss rate varying as @xmath126 .",
    "thus for an ambient density @xmath127 , the energy input by the stellar wind was constant as a function of time .",
    "since in our work the stellar wind velocity is constant if the ambient density falls off as @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , and a constant rate of energy input is a central assumption , we can make a direct comparison between dyson s ( @xcite ) results with those obtained here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : johns_results ] we show results for @xmath130 with negligible mass - loading ( large @xmath44 ) .",
    "we chose specific combinations of the variables in order to facilitate comparison with results given in fig .  2 of dyson ( @xcite ) :",
    "agreement is excellent . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shk_pos ] we plot the relative radii ( or velocities ) of the inner and outer shocks as a function of @xmath131 , the ratio of the stellar wind velocity to the velocity of the contact discontinuity ( or outer shock ) .",
    "these calculations were again made with negligible mass - loading .",
    "the results for the @xmath132 case may again be directly compared to the earlier results of dyson ( his fig .",
    "5 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shk_pos ] we also show results for other values of @xmath133 .",
    "these can not be compared to dyson s earlier results because when @xmath134 the stellar wind velocity is no longer constant with time .",
    "we find that as the value of @xmath133 increases ( which also corresponds to the mass - loading becoming increasingly dominant at large radii ) , the shocked region broadens for a given ratio of @xmath131 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : large_ml ] we present results for a case in which mass - loading dominates the evolution of the bubble . in this particular case , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "the bubble mass is over 8 times higher than the total mass lost by the star , and almost twice the mass of the ambient medium swept up into the thin shell .",
    "30 per cent of the mass lost by the star has still to pass through the inner shock .",
    "the high degree of mass - loading increases the post - shock density , and dramatically reduces the temperature in the post - shock region as more and more mass is evaporated .",
    "this reduces the sound speed , and there is eventually a sonic transition close to the cd as the flow becomes supersonic in the frame of the clumps .",
    "values of several parameters calculated from solutions with @xmath139 are given in table  [ tab : lambda-3 ] . if the mass - loading is negligible ( illustrated in the table by @xmath140 ) , we find the following : i ) as the ratio of @xmath116 increases , the fraction of energy contained in the form of thermal energy in the bubble and that in the form of kinetic energy of the shell decreases , whilst that in the form of kinetic energy of the bubble increases .",
    "the fraction of energy radiated away by the shocked interclump gas stays relatively constant , and is always a small part ( @xmath141 per cent ) of the total mechanical energy of the stellar wind over its lifetime .",
    "ii ) the mass contained in the bubble is larger than the mass of the swept - up shell only when the relative radius of the inner shock is large .",
    "iii ) for small @xmath116 , about 90 per cent of the total mechanical energy of the stellar wind is split approximately evenly between the thermal energy contained in the ssw region and the the kinetic energy of the swept up shell .",
    "as @xmath116 increases , these fractions decrease at roughly the same rate , whilst the kinetic energy of the gas inside the bubble increases , until it eventually may exceed 90 per cent of the total energy .",
    "iv ) the kinetic energy of the swept - up shell is always as great or greater than the thermal energy of the bubble ( this is also true for the solutions in table  [ tab : lambda-3 ] with @xmath139 , @xmath142 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     when we set @xmath142 , the bubble is just beginning to become mass - loaded for small values of @xmath116 .",
    "however , for @xmath139 , the swept - up mass dominates the bubble mass in this regime , as can be seen from the values in table  [ tab : lambda-3 ] .",
    "we find that solutions for which _ both _",
    "@xmath89 is large _ and _ @xmath143 is small exist only if @xmath4 .",
    "solutions for @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) and @xmath146 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda4_var ] .",
    "the solution with @xmath147 is strongly mass - loaded , and in contrast to the solutions with @xmath139 the mass of the swept up shell is also less than @xmath148 .",
    "we note that when @xmath116 is varied , notable differences between the profiles of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath119 occur in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda4_var ] . for instance ,",
    "when the bubble is only weakly mass - loaded the density at the cd is smaller than immediately after the inner shock . however , once the bubble is more strongly mass - loaded the density continuously rises from the inner shock to the cd .",
    "other differences include less deceleration of the flow , a sharp fall in the temperature ( instead of a gradual rise ) , and a rise in the mach number .",
    "finally , when the bubble becomes strongly mass - loaded , the fractional distribution of the total energy between @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 for a given @xmath116 ratio is substantially different than when the mass - loading is negligible .",
    "this is hardly surprising given the change seen in the profiles of the flow variables .",
    "an important finding is that for a given @xmath3 and ratio @xmath116 , there exists a minimum value of @xmath44 at which we can find a solution .",
    "in other words , _ there is a limit to the maximum mass - loading which the bubble can undergo_. in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_min ] we show the value of @xmath153 for various values of @xmath116 and @xmath133 .",
    "this finding has the corollary that for a given value of @xmath44 there is a maximum value of @xmath116 .",
    "the numerical reason that we are unable to obtain solutions with @xmath154 is that the denominator of the derivatives from eqs .",
    "[ eq : ode1_evap]-[eq : ode3_evap ] approaches zero _ without _ the numerators doing likewise .",
    "the physical reason is that there is a straightforward feedback mechanism limiting the amount of mass - loading that may take place : as mass from the clumps is evaporated , the temperature of the shocked region falls , which reduces the rate at which further mass can be evaporated . similarly , if the mass - loading were suddenly inhibited , the temperature of the shocked region would rise , leading to an increase in the evaporation rate .",
    "there is no reason to believe that actual wind bubbles would be at this limit because the degree of mass - loading simply depends on the number of clumps present and their individual mass injection rates ( which in our model is characterized by the value of @xmath155 ) . for a given mass , the number density of clumps , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the clump radius , whilst the mass injection rate from each clump @xmath158 .",
    "thus we can only comment that for small clumps , it is more likely that this maximum mass - loading limit will actually occur .",
    "we further note that the radial profile of the mach number of the flow relative to the clumps can take many different forms , depending on the input parameters used . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mach ] we show several examples .",
    "the profile of the mach number is influenced by the fact that mass - loading tends to drive the mach number towards unity , whilst the spherical divergence tends to drive it away from unity ( hartquist @xcite ) .",
    "panel a ) is for a case in which mass - loading is small . in this case",
    "the divergence term wins , and drives the mach number towards zero .",
    "panel b ) is for a similar situation , but in this case because the inner shock is very close to the cd , the initial postshock mach number is greater than unity so the divergence term drives it towards infinity . in panel c ) we see that the divergence is initially dominant , but as the flow approaches the cd the mach number is driven back towards unity .",
    "however , this behaviour is not due to the flow mass - loading ( although @xmath159 ) , but is rather because the density increases near the cd whilst the pressure remains constant , producing a decrease in the sound speed ( the same effect occurs for the flow shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : johns_results ] which has no mass - loading ) . the same situation occurs in panel d ) where the fall in sound speed is great enough to drive the flow through a sonic transition .",
    "the flow corresponding to panel e ) is very similar to that associated with panel d ) except we now have two sonic transitions due to the initial post - shock flow being supersonic with respect to the clumps . in plot",
    "f ) the flow is significantly mass - loaded ( @xmath160 ) , and the mass - loading term dominates the divergence term such that the mach number is driven towards unity .    finally , we have calculated profiles of the x - ray emissivity as a function of radius ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xray ] ) .",
    "we assume that the emissivity @xmath161 , which is a good approximation over the temperature range @xmath162 ( kahn @xcite ) . also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] are the radial temperature profiles .",
    "a bubble un - affected by mass - loading expanding into a surrounding medium with an @xmath128 profile of density has a higher central temperature but a lower central emissivity than at its limb .",
    "conversely , if it is expanding into a medium with an @xmath163 profile of density , the situation is reversed , as the central temperature is lower and the central emissivity is higher than at its limb .",
    "if the bubble is mass - loaded , the general trend is for a reduction in the central emissivity and an increase in the central temperature relative to the limb . to date , the only stellar wind bubbles which have been successfully observed in x - rays are two wolf - rayet ring nebulae , ngc  6888 ( wrigge @xcite ) and s308 ( wrigge @xcite ) .",
    "both have x - ray luminosities lower than expected from the standard model ( weaver @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy is normally attributed to two possibilities : either conductive evaporation of gas from the cold dense outer shell into the bubble interior , or enhanced cooling resulting from high metallicities in the cooling gas ( see maclow @xcite ) .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that our mass - loading simulations indicate that evaporation from clumps _ within _ the bubble may also be compatible with current observations . the latest x - ray satellites , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ , should provide significantly improved observations which may enable us to distinguish between these competing mechanisms .",
    "one might also expect that they may allow discrimination between a mass - loaded bubble expanding into an ambient medium with @xmath164 and a bubble unaffected by mass - loading expanding into a medium with @xmath127 .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of a mass - loaded wind blown bubble with a constant rate of ejection of mechanical energy from a central stellar wind .",
    "mass - loading is assumed to occur by the conductively induced evaporation of clumps in the region of shocked stellar wind .",
    "a central assumption is that the shocked interclump medium rapidly cools to a dense , negligibly thin , shell through which the clumps can pass undisturbed .",
    "the requirement that the solution be self - similar imposes a link between the radial variation of the interclump density ( @xmath165 ) and the mass - loading from the clumps ( @xmath166 ) which forces @xmath25 .",
    "we first reproduced solutions with negligible mass - loading and @xmath132 , which we compared with results obtained by dyson ( @xcite ) .",
    "excellent agreement for the structure of the bubble was found .",
    "we also found that the ratio of the radii ( velocities ) of the inner and outer shocks decreases with increasing @xmath133 for a given ratio of the _ current _ stellar wind velocity to the cd velocity .",
    "* substantial mass - loading of the wind - blown bubble can occur over a wide range of @xmath3 .",
    "however , to additionally satisfy the requirement that the bubble mass is larger than the mass of the swept - up shell , large values of @xmath3 are needed ( @xmath4 ) . *",
    "the profiles of the flow variables are significantly altered under conditions of large mass - loading .",
    "in particular , the average density of the shocked region is larger , the deceleration of the flow is shallower , and the temperature of the shocked wind rapidly decreases . * the mach number of the shocked stellar wind relative to the clumps which are injecting the mass can take several different forms .",
    "the shocked region can be either entirely subsonic , entirely supersonic , or have one or sometimes two sonic points .",
    "* for a given @xmath3 and ratio of the shock radii , there exists a maximum mass - loading that can occur . *",
    "mass - loading tends to reduce the emissivity in the interior of the bubble relative to its limb , whilst simultaneously increasing the central temperature relative to the limb temperature .",

    "<S> we present similarity solutions for adiabatic bubbles that are blown by winds having time dependent mechanical luminosities and that are each mass - loaded at a rate per unit volume proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the temperature , @xmath2 is the distance from the bubble center , and @xmath3 is a constant . in the limit of little mass loading a similarity solution found by dyson ( @xcite ) for expansion into a smooth ambient medium </S>",
    "<S> is recovered . for solutions that give the mass of swept - up ambient gas to be less than the sums of the masses of the wind and the evaporated material , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the mach number in a shocked mass - loaded wind shows a radial dependence that varies qualitatively from solution to solution . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> it is everywhere less than unity in the frame of the clumps being evaporated , while in others it is everywhere greater than unity . in some solutions </S>",
    "<S> the mass - loaded shocked wind undergoes one or two sonic transitions in the clump frame . </S>",
    "<S> maximum possible values of the ratio of evaporated mass to stellar wind mass are found as a consequence of the evaporation rates dependence on temperature and the lowering of the temperature by mass - loading . </S>",
    "<S> mass - loading tends to reduce the emissivity in the interior of the bubble relative to its limb , whilst simultaneously increasing the central temperature relative to the limb temperature .    </S>",
