    "in recent years , the benefits of using optimization methods to solve decision problems have been widely acknowledged in conservation biology .",
    "for example , optimization methods have been developed to best allocate limited resources to protect threatened species @xcite , protect interacting species @xcite , design reserves @xcite , eradicate invasive species @xcite , restore habitat @xcite or translocate species  @xcite . in behavioral ecology , optimization is used to test evolution by natural selection @xcite .",
    "the control of disease across meta - populations can also be optimized to ensure fastest recovery  @xcite .",
    "such optimization methods are needed because decision problems are often combinatorial : the possible decisions we have to choose from are combination of smaller ones , which makes the number of possible decisions too large to attempt an exhaustive approach ( one can not generate every possible decision and compare them ) .",
    "additionally , many conservation decision problems involve several conflicting objectives  @xcite .",
    "for example , when managing interacting species simultaneously in a complex ecosystem , increasing the abundance of one species can result in the decrease of another  @xcite .",
    "management cost can also be considered as an additional objective . however , these problems are generally converted to single - objective optimization problems , either considering only one objective or considering an a priori aggregation of the objectives  @xcite , but see  @xcite for some exceptions .",
    "in contrast to these single - objective approaches , multi - objective combinatorial optimization aims to solve multi - objective combinatorial decision problems without such reduction .    here",
    ", we show that it is possible to solve classic multi - objective combinatorial optimization conservation problems using a cutting edge approach from multi - objective optimization .",
    "the reference point method is an interactive approach that provides optimal solutions while accounting for multiple individual objectives .",
    "the preferences of the decision - maker are directly expressed as desired values on each objective .",
    "these preferences constitute the components of a reference point .",
    "then , an optimization algorithm calculates the closest possible feasible solution to these preferences .",
    "if the computed solution is deemed unsuitable , the decision - maker can update his / her preferences and a new solution is calculated .",
    "this process can be repeated iteratively until satisfaction of the decision - maker is reached .",
    "this type of method is attractive because it does not need any assumptions about the structure of preferences of the decision - maker , i.e. preferences can be handled even if they are complicated and do not follow a fixed scheme such as a linear trade - offs .",
    "additionally , associating the reference point method with linear programming as exact underlying optimization method allows us to provide optimal guarantees on solutions computed .",
    "the reference point method has yet to be used in conservation . in this paper , we present the reference point method after introducing some concepts of multi - objective combinatorial optimization and providing a brief critical review of classic approaches .",
    "we then demonstrate the benefits of applying the reference point method to two classic combinatorial problems encountered in conservation : a dynamic multi - species decision problem under uncertainty  @xcite and a spatial resource allocation problem involving several objectives including biodiversity  @xcite .",
    "we show that the linear programming reference point method outperforms the current approaches used in conservation for solving such multi - objective problems , in term of both optimality and guidance for the decision - maker .",
    "finally , we show that the formulation of the multi - species dynamic problem can be easily extended to any problem using a markov decision process ( mdp ) formalism .",
    "like any decision problem , a single - objective decision problem has the following ingredients : a model , a set of controls ( called variables ) , and an objective function depending on the variables  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in conservation , and in ecology in general , decision problems may seek to maximize several objectives simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "it is then worth considering the formal formulation of multi - objective combinatorial optimization problems  @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , are the objectives ( or criteria ) , @xmath3 is the vector of decision variables which can only take value in the set @xmath4 of _ feasible _ ( i.e. _ possible _ ) decisions .",
    "because we are in a combinatorial context , @xmath4 is assumed to be discrete .",
    "any decision @xmath5 matches with a point @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to single - objective optimization problems , which admit at most one optimal value , multi - objective optimization problems often admit several optimal points , i.e. points of @xmath7 that can not be outperformed on every objective simultaneously by another point of @xmath7 .",
    "these points are called _ non - dominated points_. formally , a non - dominated point is a point @xmath8 such that there is no @xmath9 with the property @xmath10 , where inequality @xmath11 between two points of @xmath12 is defined in box  1 .    for every @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath10 if and only if for all @xmath14 and there is @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "non - dominated points are essential in multi - objective combinatorial optimization , since they represent the best possible compromises between the different criteria .",
    "the set of non - dominated points and is also called the _ pareto frontier _  @xcite . consequently , a _ pareto frontier _ represents the set of the best compromise solutions between the different objectives .",
    "most of the multi - objective combinatorial optimization approaches aim to discover non - dominated points and their corresponding decisions , called _ efficient _ decisions .",
    "indeed , multi - objective combinatorial optimization is often related to one of the following well - known underlying challenges :    1 .",
    "find a particular non - dominated point of the pareto frontier , according to the preferences of a decision - maker ( called _ local _ approach in this paper ) ; 2 .",
    "discover the entire pareto frontier , or an approximation of this set ( called _ global _ approach in this paper ) .",
    "when the number of criteria is large ( > 3 ) , it becomes difficult to calculate , represent and analyze the pareto frontier .",
    "consequently , the local approach should be preferred for problems where the number of criteria may be more than 3 .    finding a non - dominated point according to preferences of decision - makers",
    "can be tackled using an _ aggregation function _",
    "@xcite , sometimes also called a _ scalarizing function_. the role of aggregation functions is to discriminate non - dominated points according to some preferences .",
    "more precisely , an aggregation function is a function @xmath17 from @xmath12 to @xmath18 , which associates a unique real value to every point of the criteria space . in multi - objective",
    "combinatorial optimization , @xmath17 also depends on parameters called _ preferential parameters _ , representing the preferences of a _ decision - maker _",
    "the decision - maker can be a person , a group of persons or any entity able to provide preferences .",
    "multi - objective optimization has been used for a long time in fisheries  @xcite , forestry  @xcite and natural resources management  @xcite . in these fields multi - objective optimization",
    "is referred to _ multi - objective programming _ if not interactive and _ interactive processes _ otherwise . _",
    "goal programming _ , and _ compromise programming _ , which aim to minimize the deviation between the achievement of goals and their aspiration levels ( fixed by the decision - maker in the goal programming case and computed in the compromise programming case ) , are also popular in these fields  @xcite .",
    "this section will focus on multi - objective optimization in _ conservation_.",
    "multi - objective optimization is less developed in conservation than in forestry or fisheries .",
    "for example , the well - known approximate conservation solver marxan @xcite is not a multi - objective solver , because the multiple objectives called `` targets '' are considered as constraints and not as objectives , and no multi - objective optimization framework is yet considered .      finding optimal solutions when explicitly accounting for multiple objectives in combinatorial problems is a mathematically challenging endeavor .",
    "a way to avoid this mathematical challenge is to use _ explicit _ approaches , i.e. generate a few feasible solutions and compare their performance either by sampling using a model  @xcite or empirically by asking experts  @xcite .",
    "although this approach is not , strictly speaking , multi - objective optimization , it is very common in conservation .",
    "[ [ mcda ] ] mcda + + + +     +   + the explicit approach allows us to perform multi - criteria decision analysis ( mcda ) , which is very powerful where the number of possible decisions is small  @xcite .",
    "the goal of mcda methods is to determine a best decision or strategy among a reasonable number of possible ones , given that these decisions / strategies are evaluated on several criteria    [ [ par : trade - off ] ] trade - off analysis + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     +   + another usual approach in conservation is to try to establish correlations between criteria ( trade - off analysis ) , via exhaustive approaches  @xcite , or heuristic approaches  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no reason that criteria of combinatorial problems have the same correlation from one instance to another ( changing the data could result in a complete different correlation ) .",
    "additionally , the lack of scalability of exhaustive approaches and the lack of optimality of heuristic approaches make them very limited approaches to solve combinatorial problems .      when the multi - objective problem can only be implicitly defined ( see section  [ sub : rmoo ] for a formal definition ) , we are then confronted to a multi - objective optimization problem .",
    "local approaches can be used to perform two types of methods : _ a priori _ methods and interactive methods . _",
    "a priori _ methods use a unique aggregation function , fixed and defined once by the decision - maker , while interactive methods allow the decision - maker to iteratively change his / her preferences .",
    "global approaches , which generate the entire pareto frontier , are often called _ a posteriori _ methods .",
    "[ [ a - priori - methods ] ] _ a priori _ methods + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     + several approaches in conservation aim to find a unique objective summarizing the individual objectives , and then treat the problem as a single objective . reducing several objectives in one is usually done using an _ a priori _ aggregation function , i.e. an aggregation function with fixed preference parameters .",
    "the cost - benefit approach is probably the most used approach applying this principle .",
    "the cost - benefit approach is an economic approach where every criteria is considered as having an economic counter - part @xcite .",
    "such functions are often used to perform a `` cost - benefit '' analysis  @xcite .",
    "other aggregation functions of the objectives have been studied in conservation  @xcite .",
    "several major well - known drawbacks occur in these approaches .",
    "using economic values of species is ethically controversial because it requires associating an economic value to species  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in practice , depending on the economical evaluation methods , the value of a species can vary significantly , sometimes from one to tenfold  @xcite .",
    "the second drawback is related to the subjectivity and the complexity of the fixed aggregation function .",
    "choosing among a set of potential aggregation functions can be difficult to justify  @xcite .",
    "finally , reasoning with one objective ( aggregated function ) instead of several , reduces considerably the role of the decision - maker in the optimization process .",
    "indeed , his / her role is then limited to define the problem . a prescribed solution is then provided by the scientists , missing an opportunity to involve the decision - maker in the decision - making process itself .    [",

    "methods @xcite . _",
    "a posteriori _ methods corresponds to trade - off analysis methods for implicit approaches . generating the pareto frontier is only possible and relevant for problems with a small number of objectives .",
    "[ [ sub : rp_method ] ] interactive methods + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     + generally based on the use of parametric aggregation functions , _ interactive methods _ aim to find a `` best compromise solution '' interactively with decision - makers @xcite . in these methods",
    ", the decision - maker preferences can evolve according to the following iterative procedure :    * optimization results are obtained using current preferences ; * new preferences are obtained by eliciting feedback from the decision - maker on current results .",
    "fig 1 provides a graphical illustration of the interactive procedure .",
    "multi - objective optimization interactive methods are not very common in conservation but see  @xcite for an exception .    in theory ,",
    "every _ a priori _ method can be used in an interactive way . unfortunately",
    ", none of the previously mentioned _ a priori _ method can satisfy the following requirements :    * every solution provided by the algorithm corresponds to a non - dominated point of the multi - objective problem . *",
    "every non - dominated point of the multi - objective problem can be generated by the algorithm .",
    "these requirements are very important , because we would like to avoid generating points which are dominated by others , while being able to generate every possible non - dominated point for the seek of a good compromise solution .",
    "maybe the most famous interactive method is the weighted sum method .",
    "the ( interactive ) aggregation function is the weighted sum of the normalized objectives where weights represent only the `` importance '' of every criterion .",
    "this method unfortunately fails to satisfy the requirements . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors use a weighted sum method to aggregate two objectives : learning about the model and managing in an optimal adaptive management framework ( not used in an interactive way however ) .",
    "if the criteria are normalized , the weights can be seen as preference parameters defined in section  [ sub : rmoo ] .",
    "however , several drawbacks still occur : the first drawback is that weights have no _ significance _ , and transforming them into meaningful values  @xcite can be obscure for the decision - maker  @xcite , because the true preferential parameters are hidden .",
    "more importantly , the weighted sum method is well - known to not provide good _ compromise solutions _",
    "@xcite , i.e. solutions which are well balanced when considering their criteria values .",
    "the weighted sum method favors extreme solutions .",
    "finally , this method makes the strong assumption that one objective can always linearly compensate linearly another objective .",
    "however , as raised in @xcite , the following question has in general no answer : `` how much must be gained in the achievement of one objective to compensate for a lesser achievement on a different objective ? '' .",
    "human preferences are often much more complicated than linear trade - offs and may require more elaborate methods .",
    "conversely , the reference point method is one of the only multi - objective optimization methods to satisfy the requirements  @xcite .",
    "because in this paper we use only the linear programming formulation of the reference point method , we will only present a linear programming formulation ( section  [ sub : rplp ] ) .",
    "linear programming is well - known in conservation  @xcite , but less in the context of multi - objective optimization , especially for reference point based approaches .",
    "using the reference point method requires solving an optimization problem at every iteration of the interactive process .",
    "although other optimization methods are possible , linear programming ( lp ) is particularly well suited to solve this problem .",
    "the lp formulation with @xmath19 objectives , @xmath20 variables and @xmath21 constraints is : + @xmath22 + variables are components of vector @xmath3 , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 are linear functions .",
    "@xmath3 represents the decision , @xmath25 are the objective values , and @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the maximum and the minimum possible values of @xmath34 obtained by performing the corresponding single - objective optimization .",
    "@xmath35 is a small strictly positive number required to avoid generating weakly non - dominated points , i.e. points which can be dominated over a subset of objectives .",
    "avoiding weakly dominated points is possible by setting @xmath35 to a value inferior to @xmath36  @xcite , thanks to the combinatorial context ( @xmath3 takes discrete values ) .",
    "+ the simplicity of the formulation is one reason of the popularity of lp to solve the reference point method , which has been implemented in many fields where combinatorial problems occur , for example in telecommunication @xcite , finance @xcite or transportation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the lp reference point method requires finding good lp formulations , which in the case of discrete optimization , is in general a hard task and requires a strong knowledge of the conservation problems and lp techniques . in this section we present lp formulations for a multi - species dynamic conservation problem and a multi - objective environmental spatial resource allocation problem , so that the reference point method can be applied in both cases .",
    "+      in @xcite , the authors propose a method for solving a sequential decision problem under uncertainty , aiming to conserve simultaneously two interacting endangered species : northern abalone and sea otters .",
    "this bi - objective is solved using ( indirectly ) an _ a priori _ weighted sum of the objectives .",
    "different weights are tested to generate and explore alternatives .",
    "weighting the criteria allows the use of classic mdp solution methods such as dynamic programming @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the problem is a predator - prey problem where interactions between sea otters and their preferred prey abalone are described using a mdp formalism . every year , managers must decide between 4 actions : introduce sea otters , enforce abalone anti - poaching measures , control sea otters , half enforce anti - poaching measures and half control sea otters .",
    "the time horizon is 20 years .",
    "the original problem aims to maximize the density of abalone and abundance of sea otters .",
    "+ because weighting the objectives of an optimization problem can be controversial ( see section  [ sub : classic_eco ] ) , we propose to use the linear programming reference point method .",
    "adapting program  [ lp_multi ] directly to a lp formulation of mdps is challenging because rewards appear only in the constraints and not in the objective . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors were confronted with the same situation when they tried to apply a similar multi - objective optimization technique ( the chebyshev method ) to mdps in a robotic context .",
    "the chebyshev method aims to minimize the chebyshev norm between the reference point and the decision space .",
    "the reference point method is different for several reasons .",
    "first , in the reference point method , preferences of the decision - maker are directly expressed as values on every criterion , while in the chebyshev method preferences are expressed as weights .",
    "second , the reference point method allows the decision - maker to choose values inside the feasible space , which is not the case in the chebyshev method .",
    "however , the same idea as in @xcite can also be used for the linear programming reference point method formulation .",
    "we first wrote the single - objective dual lp formulation of mdps and then adapted program  [ lp_multi ] to it . lp and",

    "<S> managing biodiversity extinction crisis requires wise decision - making processes able to account for the limited of resources available . in most decision problems in conservation biology , several conflicting objectives have to be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> most methods used in conservation either provide suboptimal solutions or use strong assumptions about the decision - maker s preferences . </S>",
    "<S> our paper reviews some of the existing approaches to solve multi - objective decision problems and presents new multi - objective linear programming formulations of two multi - objective optimization problems in conservation , allowing the use of a reference point approach . </S>",
    "<S> reference point approaches solve multi - objective optimization problems by interactively representing the preferences of the decision - maker with a point in the criteria space , called the reference point . </S>",
    "<S> we modelled and solved the following two conservation problems : a dynamic multi - species management problem under uncertainty and a spatial allocation resource management problem . </S>",
    "<S> results show that the reference point method outperforms classic methods while illustrating the use of an interactive methodology for solving combinatorial problems with multiple objectives . </S>",
    "<S> the method is general and can be adapted to a wide range of ecological combinatorial problems .    * keywords * : conservation ; multi - objective ; optimization ; reference point ; linear programming ; combinatorial ; uncertainty ; multi - species dynamic ; spatial resource allocation </S>"
