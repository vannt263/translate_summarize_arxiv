    "despite its successes in describing _",
    "macroscopic _ gravitational phenomena , einstein s general relativity ( gr ) still lacks the status of a fundamental _ microscopic _ theory , because of the problem of quantization and the existence of singular solutions under very general assumptions . among various attempts to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "gauge theories of gravity are especially attractive , as the concept of gauge symmetry has been very successful in the foundation of other fundamental interactions .",
    "the importance of poincar symmetry in particle physics leads one to consider poincar gauge theory as a natural framework for description of the gravitational phenomena .",
    "the principle of equivalence implies that einstein s gr is invariant under local poincar transformations . instead of thinking of local poincar symmetry",
    "as derived from the principle of equivalence , the whole idea can be reversed , in accordance with the usual philosophy of gauge theories .",
    "when gravitational field is absent , it has become clear from a host of experiments that the underlying spacetime symmetry of fundamental interactions is given by the _ global _ ( rigid ) poincar group .",
    "if we now want to make a physical theory invariant under _ local _ poincar transformations , with parameters which depend on spacetime points , it is necessary to introduce new , _ compensating fields _ ; these fields are found to represent the gravitational interaction .",
    "localization of poincar symmetry leads to poincar gauge theory of gravity , which contains gr as a special case . here",
    ", in contrast to gr , at each point of spacetime there exists a whole class of local inertial frames , mutually related by lorentz transformations . using this freedom , allowed by the principle of equivalence",
    ", one can naturally introduce not only _ energy - momentum _ , but also _ spin _ of matter fields into gravitational dynamics .",
    "we begin our exposition by presenting the basic principles of poincar gauge theory ( pgt ) .",
    "then , an analysis of the geometric interpretation of pgt leads us to conclude that spacetime has the structure of riemann  cartan geometry , possessing both the _ curvature _ and the _ torsion_. finally , we study in more details the teleparallel limit of pgt , which represents a viable alternative gravitational theory for macroscopic matter .",
    "we shall now analyze the process of transition from global to local poincar symmetry , and find its relation to the gravitational interaction [ 16 ] .",
    "other spacetime symmetries ( de sitter , weyl , etc . ) can by treated in an analogous manner @xcite .      in physical processes at low energies",
    ", the gravitational field does not have a significant role , since the gravitational interaction is extremely weak . in the absence of gravity ,",
    "the spacetime is described by the special relativity ( sr ) , and its mathematical structure corresponds to minkowski space @xmath0 .",
    "the physical observer in spacetime makes use of some _ reference frame _ , endowed with coordinates @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "an _ inertial observer _ in @xmath0 can always choose global inertial coordinates , such that the infinitesimal interval takes the simple form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are components of the metric in the inertial frame .",

    "the isometry group of @xmath0 is the group of global ( rigid ) poincar transformations , the infinitesimal form of which is given by x^=x^+^(x ) , ^=^x^+^ , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are ten constant parameters ( lorentz rotations and translations ) .    in order to define matter fields in spacetime ( scalars , spinors , etc . )",
    ", it is useful to introduce the concept of tangent space .",
    "the set of all tangent vectors at point @xmath8 in @xmath0 defines the tangent space @xmath9 .",
    "since the geometric structure of @xmath0 is pretty simple , the structure of @xmath9 actually coincides with that of @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of basis in the tangent space ( frame ) is not unique . a coordinate frame ( @xmath10 frame )",
    "is determined by a set of four vectors @xmath11 , tangent to the coordinate lines @xmath1 . in @xmath0",
    "we can also introduce a local lorentz frame ( @xmath12 frame ) , represented by a set of four orthonormal tangent vectors @xmath13 ( vierbein or tetrad ) : @xmath14 .",
    "refer to local @xmath12 frames , while the greek indices @xmath15 refer to @xmath10 frames .",
    "later , when we come to a geometric interpretation , this distinction will become geometrically more important . ] to each @xmath12 frame @xmath16 we can associate the related ( local ) inertial coordinates @xmath17 .",
    "if the coordinates @xmath1 are globally inertial , one can always choose the tetrad in such a way that it coincides with the @xmath10 frame , @xmath18 .",
    "a matter field @xmath19 in spacetime is always referred to an @xmath12 frame ; in general , it is a multicomponent object which can be represented as a vector - column .",
    "the action of global poincar transformations in @xmath9 transforms each @xmath12 frame into another @xmath12 frame , inducing an appropriate transformation of the field @xmath19 : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the spin matrix related to the multicomponent structure of @xmath19 .",
    "equivalently , we can write _ 0= ( ^ijm_ij+^k p_k ) , where @xmath22 is the change of form of @xmath19 , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , are the generators of global poincar transformations in the space of fields .",
    "since form variation and differentiation are commuting operations , we easily derive from the transformation law for @xmath25 : _ 0_k=_k+_k^i_i _ k^m_m .",
    "dynamical content of basic physical interactions is successfully described by lagrangian field theory .",
    "dynamical variables in this theory are fields @xmath19 , and dynamics is determined by a function @xmath26 , called the lagrangian .",
    "equations of motion are given as the euler ",
    "lagrange equations for the action integral @xmath27 .",
    "invariance of a theory under spacetime transformations can be expressed in terms of some conditions on the lagrangian , which are different from those characterizing yang  mills theories . to see that ,",
    "consider an action integral defined over a spacetime region @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where we allow for the possibility that @xmath30 may depend explicitly on @xmath31 .",
    "the action integral is invariant under spacetime transformations @xmath32 if @xcite _ 0+^_+(_^)=0 , where @xmath33 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath30 satisfying the invariance condition is usually called an invariant density . here , we wish to make two comments : ( a ) the above result is based on the assumption @xmath34 ; ( b ) the condition can be relaxed by demanding a weaker condition @xmath35 ; in that case the action changes by a surface term , but the equations of motion remain invariant .",
    "if we now substitute the poincar expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 in , the vanishing of the coefficients multiplying @xmath38 and @xmath36 implies two sets of identities : the first identity is the condition of lorentz invariance , while the second one , related to translational invariance , is equivalent to the absence of any explicit @xmath31 dependence in @xmath30 , as one could have expected .",
    "assuming the equations of motion to hold , the invariance condition leads to the differential conservation laws for noether currents  the energy - momentum and angular momentum tensors .",
    "spatial integrals of the null components of the currents define the related charges .",
    "the usual conservation in time of these charges does not hold automatically , but only if the related flux integrals through the boundary of the three - space vanish .",
    "suppose now that we have a theory described by the matter lagrangian @xmath39 , which is invariant under global poincar transformations .",
    "if we now generalize poincar transformations by replacing ten _ constant _ group parameters with some _ functions _ of spacetime points , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the invariance condition is violated for two reasons :    the old transformation rule of @xmath25 is changed into _",
    "0_k&=&_k-(_k^ ) _ + ( _ k^ij)_ij + & = & _ k^m_m+ ( , ) ;    the term @xmath42 in does not vanish , in contrast to the old relation @xmath43 .",
    "the violation of local invariance can be compensated by certain modifications of the original theory , whereupon the resulting theory becomes locally invariant .    in the first step of our compensation procedure ,",
    "we wish to eliminate non - invariance stemming from the change of the transformation rule of @xmath25 .",
    "this can be accomplished by introducing a new lagrangian _",
    "m=_m(,_k ) , where @xmath44 is the _ covariant derivative _ of @xmath45 , which transforms according to the  old rule \" : _ 0_k=_k+_k^i_i . the new lagrangian satisfies the condition @xmath46 .",
    "the construction of @xmath44 is realized in two steps : i)&&_=(_+ a _ ) , a_a^ij__ij , + ii)&&_k=_k^_-a^ _ h_k^ _ .",
    "the transformation rule of the @xmath47-covariant derivative @xmath48 , _",
    "0_=_-(_^ ) _ , is chosen so as to eliminate the term @xmath49 appearing in ; it leads to a definite transformation rule for the lorentz compensating field @xmath50 , given in .",
    "the complete @xmath44 is defined by adding a new field , @xmath51 , with the transformation properties defined by equation .",
    "it is useful to introduce another field @xmath52 , the inverse of @xmath53 : @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the transformation laws for the compensating fields @xmath50 and @xmath56 read : & & _ 0a^ij_= -_^ij -(_^)a^ij_-^_a^ij _ , + & & _ 0 b^k_=^k_sb^s_-(_^)b^k_ -^_b^k _ , with @xmath57 .    in order to facilitate geometric interpretation of the local transformations , it is convenient to generalize our previous convention concerning the use of latin and greek indices .",
    "according to the transformation rules , the use of indices in @xmath50 and @xmath56 follows the following convention : the fields transform as local lorentz tensors with respect to latin indices , and as world ( coordinate ) tensors with respect to greek indices ; the term @xmath58 shows that @xmath50 is not a true tensor but a potential .",
    "one can also check that local lorentz tensors can be transformed into world tensors and vice versa , by the multiplication with @xmath53 or @xmath56 .    up to now",
    "we have found the lagrangian @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 . in the second step of restoring local invariance of the theory , we have to take care of the fact that @xmath61 .",
    "this can be done by introducing @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a suitable function of the new fields .",
    "the invariance condition for @xmath64 holds if @xmath65 .",
    "using the known transformation properties of the fields , one finds a simple solution for @xmath63 : @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the final form of the modified lagrangian for matter fields is _",
    "m = b_m(,_k ) .",
    "it is obtained from the original lagrangian @xmath67 by the minimal coupling prescription : a ) @xmath68 and b ) @xmath69 . the lagrangian",
    "@xmath64 satisfies the invariance condition by construction , hence it is an invariant density .",
    "the above construction is in general valid for massive matter fields . in electrodynamics , however , one _ can not _ apply the prescription @xmath70 without violating the internal @xmath71 gauge symmetry ! hence , in order to retain the internal gauge symmetry , one should keep the original field strength unchanged , @xmath72 . although the minimal coupling prescription is thereby abandoned , the procedure is compatible with _ both _ internal gauge symmetry and local poincar covariance @xcite .",
    "consequently , the gravitational coupling to the electromagnetic field in pgt remains the _ same _ as in gr .",
    "we succeeded to modify the original matter lagrangian by introducing gauge potentials , so that the invariance condition remains true also for local poincar transformations .",
    "in order to construct a lagrangian for the new fields @xmath56 and @xmath50 , we shall first introduce the corresponding _",
    "field strengths_. the commutator of two covariant derivatives has the form @xmath73\\phi=\\fr{1}{2}f^{ij}{}_{kl}\\s_{ij}\\phi",
    "-f^s{_{kl}}\\nabla_s\\phi\\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and & & f^ij__a^ij_-_a^ij _",
    "+ a^i_sa^sj_-a^i_sa^sj _ , + & & f^i__b^i_-_b^i _ .",
    "the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 are called the lorentz and translation field strengths , respectively .",
    "they transform as tensors , in conformity with their index structure .",
    "jacoby identities for the commutators of covariant derivatives imply the following _ bianchi identities _ for the field strengths : ( ) & & ^_f^s_ = ^f^s_kb^k _ , + ( ) & & ^_f^ij_=0 .",
    "the free lagrangian must be an invariant density depending only on the field strengths , while the complete lagrangian of matter and gauge fields has the form = b_f(f^ij_kl , f^i_kl ) + b_m(,_k ) .",
    "the invariance of the lagrangian in a gauge theory for an internal symmetry leads , after using the equations of motion , to covariantly generalized differential conservation laws .",
    "the same thing happens also in pgt .",
    "we restrict our discussion to the matter lagrangian @xmath64 , and introduce _ dynamical _ energy - momentum and spin currents for matter fields : @xmath78 assuming that matter field equations are satisfied , one can show that local poincar invariance leads to generalized conservation laws of the dynamical currents @xcite : & & b^k__^=^_kf^k_+ ^_ijf^ij _ , + & & _ ^_ij=_ij-_ji .",
    "similar analysis can be applied to the complete lagrangian .",
    "in order to facilitate a proper understanding of the geometric content of pgt , we introduce here some basic concepts of differential geometry @xcite .",
    "spacetime is often described as a ",
    "four - dimensional continuum \" . in sr",
    ", it has the structure of minkowski space @xmath0 . in the presence of gravity spacetime",
    "can be divided into  small , flat pieces \" in which sr holds ( on the basis of the principle of equivalence ) , and these pieces are  sewn together \" smoothly .",
    "although spacetime looks locally like @xmath0 , it may have quite different global properties .",
    "mathematical description of such four - dimensional continuum is given by the concept of a differentiable manifold .    to be more rigorous",
    ", one should start with the natural concept of _ topological space _ , which allows a precise formulation of the idea of continuity . a topological space @xmath79 is given the structure of a _ manifold _",
    "by introducing local coordinates on @xmath79 .",
    "the compatibility of different local coordinate systems promotes a manifold into a _ differentiable manifold _ , in which one can easily introduce and study mappings which are both continuous and differentiable .",
    "thus , we assume that spacetime has the structure of a differentiable manifold @xmath80 .",
    "we believe that the laws of physics can be expressed as relations between geometric objects , such as vectors , tensors , etc ..    in order to define _ tangent vectors _ in terms of the internal structure of the manifold , one should abandon the idea of the  displacement \" of a point . the most acceptable approach is to define tangent vectors as directional derivatives , without any reference to embedding .",
    "directional derivatives represent an abstract realization of the usual geometric notion of tangent vectors .",
    "the set of all tangent vectors at @xmath8 defines the tangent space @xmath9 .",
    "the set of vectors tangent to the coordinate lines @xmath1 defines the coordinate basis @xmath81 in @xmath9 .",
    "an arbitrary vector in @xmath9 can be represented in the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 are components of in the basis @xmath11 . under the change of local",
    "coordinates @xmath84 , both @xmath11 and @xmath83 change the form , @xmath85 but itself remains invariant .",
    "the second equation is known as the vector transformation law .",
    "vectors @xmath86 are usually called contravariant vectors .    following the usual ideas of linear algebra , we can associate a dual vector space @xmath87 with each tangent space @xmath9 of @xmath79 . consider linear mappings from @xmath9 to @xmath88 ,",
    "defined by @xmath89 .",
    "if a set of these mappings is equipped with the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplication , we obtain the dual vector space @xmath87 .",
    "vectors @xmath90 in @xmath87 are called _ dual vectors _ , covariant vectors ( covectors ) or differential forms .",
    "given the basis @xmath11 in @xmath9 , one can construct its dual basis @xmath91 in @xmath87 by demanding @xmath92 , or equivalently , @xmath93 .",
    "each dual vector @xmath90 can be represented in the form @xmath94 .",
    "a change of local coordinates induces the following change in @xmath91 and @xmath95 : @xmath96 to simplify the notation , one usually omits the sign @xmath97 for dual vectors .    the concept of a dual vector as a linear mapping from @xmath9 to @xmath88 , can be naturally extended to the concept of _ tensor _ as a multilinear mapping .",
    "thus , a tensor of type ( 0,2 ) is a bilinear mapping which maps a pair of vectors ( , ) into a real number ( , ) . using the dual basis @xmath98 , we can represent as @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , a tensor of type ( 1,1 ) maps a pair @xmath101 into a real number @xmath102 . after these examples , it is not difficult to define the general tensor of type @xmath103 .",
    "its components transform as the product of @xmath104 vectors and @xmath105 dual vectors .    a _ tensor field _",
    "on @xmath79 is a mapping @xmath106 that associates a tensor @xmath107 to each point @xmath31 in @xmath79 .",

    "although the generator @xmath284 is not truly independent of @xmath285 , it is convenient to define @xmath286 as an overcomplete gauge generator , since it automatically generates the covariant lagrangian form of the @xmath248 symmetry .",
