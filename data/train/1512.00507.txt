    "a cluster algebra is known as * mutation - infinite * otherwise .",
    "combinatorial formulas are known for many mutation - finite cluster algebras @xcite since most such cluster algebras come from surfaces ( see @xcite ) . for mutation - infinite cluster algebras , providing a combinatorial formula for every single cluster variable of that algebra is quite a challenge .",

    "our work yields further progress towards this combinatorial goal for a rich example which helps to illustrate new features that were unseen in previous descriptions of subsets of cluster varibles for mutation - infinite cluster algebras .",
    "in particular , we describe a three - parameter family of subgraphs of @xmath9 with the property that a certain weighted enumeration of * dimers * ( also known as * perfect matchings * ) yields most of the laurent expansions of the * toric cluster variables * , which are a subset of the generators of the associated @xmath0-cluster algebra .",
    "this is stated more precisely as theorem [ thm : main ] in terms of the language developed in our paper .",
    "we present our combinatorial formula and methods in full detail with an intention to generalize these methods to further examples in future work .",
    "we now say a little about the history of this problem before discussing the organization of this paper .",
    "even before the connections between the mathematics and physics of brane tilings were well - known , mathematicians had been studying perfect matchings of @xmath9 since the turn of the millennium , as by jim propp , ben wieland ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 15 ) and mihai ciucu ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) .",
    "( more precisely they were studying tilings of the dual graph of @xmath9 which consists of regular hexagons , squares , and triangles . ) in the modern language , propp conjectured ( proven by unpublished work of wieland and published work by ciucu ) that a certain one - parameter family of subgraphs of @xmath9 called * aztec dragons * , as an analogue of * aztec diamonds * @xcite , had the property that the number of perfect matchings of each subgraph was a power of two .",
    "while leading an reu ( research experience for undergraduates ) at the university of minnesota in 2012 , the second author proposed a problem motivated by sergey fomin and andrei zelevinsky s theory of cluster algebras @xcite and the above mentioned theoretical physics .",
    "definitions of cluster algebras and mutation appear in section [ sec : mutations ] .",
    "the goal was to obtain combinatorial formulas for the laurent expansions of cluster variables obtained by certain sequences of mutations of quivers of interest to string theorists such as those associated to reflexive polygons @xcite .",
    "as part of this reu , sicong zhang was inspired by a paper by cyndie cottrell and benjamin young @xcite and proved that by weighting the perfect matchings of aztec dragons in the appropriate way , it followed that the resulting partition functions ( which are laurent polynomials in this case ) agreed with the corresponding cluster variables @xcite .",
    "in the subsequent summer , 2013 reu students megan leoni , seth neel , and paxton turner worked with the second author to provide a combinatorial interpretation for a two - parameter family of mutation sequences by extending to a family of subgraphs beyond aztec dragons @xcite .",
    "these were referred to as ne ( northeast ) aztec castles and sw ( southwest ) aztec castles .",
    "simultaneously , in indiana , an alternative motivation for generalizing aztec dragons was being studied by ciucu and the first author .",
    "similar to the aztec diamonds and the aztec dragons , james propp also introduced aztec dungeons on a different lattice ( the lattice corresponding to the affine coxeter group @xmath10 ) and conjectured an explicit tiling formula for these regions , which is a power of @xmath11 or twice a power of @xmath11 .",
    "this conjecture was later proven by ciucu ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) ) .",
    "inspired by the aztec dungeons , matt blum considered a hexagonal counterpart of them called * hexagonal dungeons*. blum had conjectured a striking pattern of the number of tilings of a hexagonal dungeon of side - lengths @xmath12 in cyclic order ( @xmath13 ) , which is @xmath14 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 25 ) ) .",
    "the first author and ciucu proved and generalized blum s conjecture @xcite by enumerating tilings of two families of regions restricted in a six - sided contour .",
    "this proof inspired a number of similar regions on different lattices , including * dragon regions * denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "these dragon regions generalized propp s aztec dragons @xcite and the ne / sw - aztec castles of @xcite .",
    "the present work provides a vivid picture of the cluster algebra associated to the @xmath0 quiver and is a culmination of the above work on one - parameter , two - parameter , unweighted families of subgraphs of the @xmath0 brane tiling @xmath9 .",
    "we describe a general construction that yields the dragon regions of @xcite such that the laurent polynomials obtained from the weighted enumeration of perfect matchings on such subgraphs of @xmath9 are exactly a three - parameter family of cluster variables in the @xmath0-cluster algebra . for lack of a better name",
    ", we have decided to refer to the three - parameter family of subgraphs @xmath9 constructed in this paper as ( general ) * aztec castles*. the work of the first author in @xcite can be considered as a special case of the unweighted version of the main result , theorem [ thm : main ] , of the present paper .",
    "we prove in section [ sec : gentoric ] that this * three - parameter family of cluster variables * is indeed the * set of toric cluster variables*. though our work begins with a description of certain mutation sequences known as * generalized @xmath17-mutation sequences * , we show , see lemma [ lem : gentoric ] , that for all toric cluster variables @xmath18 , there exists a cluster reachable via a generalized @xmath17-mutation sequence which contains @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the aforementioned three - dimensional parameterization is indeed a parameterization of the entire set of toric cluster variables .",
    "the combinatorial interpretation developed in this paper is in a similar spirit as david speyer s * crosses - and - wrenches * graphical interpretation for solutions to the octahedron recurrence @xcite , philippe di francesco s dimer solutions to * t - systems * @xcite , or bosquet - melou - propp - west s * pinecone * graphs @xcite .",
    "however as we highlight , both throughout the paper and especially in section [ sec : open ] , the @xmath0 cluster algebra and aztec castles provide several new combinatorial features that were not seen in these earlier examples , and yet , due to the symmetry of the @xmath0 quiver , this example is ideal for detailed analysis .    in section 2 ,",
    "we begin with the relevant background material on cluster algebras and then provide a geometric viewpoint on certain cluster mutations ( toric mutations ) of the @xmath0 cluster algebra .",
    "section 3 presents our first theorem ( theorem [ thm : explicit ] ) which is an explicit algebraic formula for the laurent expansion of any cluster variable reachable from toric mutations of the @xmath0 quiver .",
    "this provides a three - parameter family which extends the one - parameter and two - parameter families of cluster variables discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in section 4 , we illustrate how to construct aztec castles via six - tuples which is motivated by the constructions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section 5 discusses why it is sufficient to consider a certain three - parameter family of six - tuples and provides a complete illustration of all of the possible shapes of aztec castles .",
    "this leads us to our main theorem ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) which yields a combinatorial interpretation in terms of the @xmath0 brane tiling for most cluster variables reachable from toric mutations .",
    "there is an issue regarding self - intersecting contours that prevents us from getting a combinatorial interpretation for all reachable cluster variables in terms of perfect matchings even though the algebraic formula of theorem [ thm : explicit ] still applies in such cases .",
    "sections 6 and 7 provide the proof of our main theorem , while section 8 includes some examples illustrating the proof . we finish with open problems and directions for further research in section 9 .",
    "we begin by reviewing the definition of quiver mutations and cluster mutations .",
    "this leads us to study a special subcollection of mutation sequences known as toric mutation sequences .",
    "this special subcollection includes the @xmath17-mutation sequences from @xcite as special cases .",
    "we provide a geometric interpretation that allows us to examine toric mutation sequences essentially as alcove - walks on the @xmath19 lattice , which extends the visualization of @xmath17-mutation sequences as @xmath20-alcove walks from @xcite .",
    "we exploit this identification later in this paper to obtain explicit algebraic formulas , theorem [ thm : explicit ] , and combinatorial interpretations , theorem [ thm : main ] , for the resulting cluster variables .      a * quiver * @xmath21 is a directed finite graph with a set of vertices @xmath22 and a set of edges @xmath23 connecting them whose direction is denoted by an arrow . for our purposes",
    "@xmath21 may have multiple edges connecting two vertices but may not contain any loops or @xmath24cycles .",
    "we can relate a cluster algebra with initial seed @xmath25 to @xmath21 by associating a cluster variable @xmath26 to every vertex labeled @xmath27 in @xmath21 where @xmath28 .",

    "* reverse the directions of the arrows incident to @xmath27 * delete any 2-cycles created from the previous two steps .",

    "as described in section [ sec : walks ] , the importance of the generalized @xmath17-mutation sequences is that out of the space of all possible toric mutation sequences , the generalized @xmath17-mutation sequences are the ones that map a cluster that looks like a prism ( which is an example of a zonotope ) to a translation , or a glide reflection , of the same prism .",

    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] shares similarities to the methods in those papers but using all four types of kuo condensation theorems provided us with a greater toolbox .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , a consequence of relying solely on only one of the four types of kuo condensations was the need to consider only certain subsequences of @xmath17-mutation sequences along a so - called canonical path as opposed to mutations in any direction .",
    "this was handled by induction and taking advantage of symmetries but required a non - intuitive decomposition of the @xmath229-plane into twelve regions .",
    "analogously , the first author s previous work in @xcite had to rely on a large number of base cases without utilizing the additional three kuo condensation theorems .",
    "we believe that more widely used application of all four of these kuo condensation recurrences will allow more elegant attacks on other perfect matching enumeration problems that had previously appeared too daunting .",
    "in this paper , we succeeded in starting from the model 1 @xmath0 quiver and providing a @xmath19-parameterization of cluster variables that are reachable via sequences of toric mutations ( i.e. two incoming arrows and two outgoing arrows at every vertex when it is mutated ) .",
    "for such cluster variables , we presented an explicit algebra formula for their laurent expansions in terms of this parameterization .",
    "then for most of these cluster variables ( the ones corresponding to contours without self - intersections ) we also gave a combinatorial interpretation to these laurent expansions in terms of subgraphs of the @xmath0 brane tiling @xmath9 .",
    "we suspect that the methods of this paper should generalize to other quivers associated to brane tilings , i.e. those that can be embedded on a torus",
    ". one interesting feature of the @xmath0 case was the fact that the associated toric diagram and contours had six possible sides rather than the four sides that show up in the study of the octahedron recurrence @xcite , @xmath575-systems @xcite , gale - robinson sequences and pinecones @xcite .",
    "this led to new phenomena such as self - intersecting contours which we wish to investigate further in future work .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath0 provides an example with a lot of symmetry coming from the toric diagram consisting of three pairs of anti - parallel sides .",
    "additionally , model 1 gives rise to a brane tiling which is * isoradial * , meaning that * alternating - strand diagrams * @xcite , also known as * postnikov diagrams * or * zig - zag paths * @xcite , behave ( and can be drawn as ) straight lines @xcite . for less symmetric cases , the contours might not follow the lines of the brane tiling and instead require a description directly in terms of zig - zag paths or alternating - strands instead .",
    "in particular , the boundaries of the subgraphs in this paper are actually segments of zig - zag - paths ( as observed by r. kenyon ) and the alternating - strand diagrams would naturally oscillate along the contour lines thereby separating the line of white and black vertices on the strands two sides .",
    "however , translating lengths of these zig - zags into coordinates was not as well - behaved ( see @xcite ) as the contour - coordinates of this current paper . based on conversations with david speyer and dylan thurston",
    ", they have unpublished work that works with zig - zag coordinates for general brane tilings to yield cluster structures .",
    "[ prob : self - int ] how do we make sense of contours that self - intersect , and their corresponding subgraphs so that we get the desired cluster variables and laurent polynomials ? as indicated by conversations with r. kenyon , d. speyer , and b. young , we suspect there is some sort of double - dimer interpretation for the laurent expansions of such cluster variables",
    ". initial conjectured combinatorial interpretations in this direction did not produce the correct formulas , but more recent computations by the second author and d. speyer showed more promise .",
    "we saw in remarks [ rem : rg ] and [ rem : zono ] that the generalized @xmath17-mutation sequences have particular properties of note to physicists that more general toric mutation sequences lack .",
    "mathematically , we wonder if there are other important ways that the generalized @xmath17-mutation sequences are special .",
    "we have already seen that they satisfy coxeter relations in this example . additionally , based on explorations by michael shapiro and michael gehktman @xcite",
    ", it seems natural to ask if the generalized @xmath17-mutation sequences represent the integrable directions of motions in the discrete integrable system induced by this cluster algebra .",
    "how well do the results and methods of this paper extend to other quivers and subgraph interpretations ?",
    "for example the @xmath576 , gale - robinson quivers , and others arising from the octahedron recurrence or @xmath575-systems have similar looking combinatorial interpretations using aztec diamonds or pinecones .",
    "can we construct the aztec diamonds and pinecones using a parameterization and contour coordinates ? in principle , this should agree with the methods in @xcite , but the transformation between the two coordinate systems and parameterization of cluster variables is still not written down .",
    "in the first authors work on blum s conjecture with ciucu @xcite , a number of other subgraphs of doubly - periodic tilings of the plane appear .",
    "some of these are called needle families and hexagonal dungeons .",
    "in fact the hexagonal dungeons are the dual graph for the model 4 @xmath0 quiver , so it is expected that the weighted enumeration of perfect matchings of these regions should indeed yield laurent expansions of cluster variables starting with a different initial cluster .",
    "however , one mystery is why contours have coordinates @xmath310 summing up to @xmath41 in the present paper ( see lemma [ lem : closeup ] ) , but summing up to @xmath42 in the case of hexagonal dungeons . for the needle family , this seems to be a genuinely different quiver .",
    "can we find other quivers such that the weighted enumeration of perfect matchings of those subgraphs also yield laurent expansions of cluster variables reachable by certain mutation sequences in the corresponding cluster algebra ?",
    "in work in progress with di francesco , the equations of section [ sec : explicit ] seem well - suited for analyzing limit shapes .",
    "this analysis uses techniques similar to those used in the case of t - systems by di francesco and soto - garrido for studying arctic curves @xcite .",
    "several nuances appear to make this case quite interesting such as multi - dimensional time and the role of non - convex regions .",
    "in his study of admissible @xmath39-graphs , stembridge @xcite introduced a family of directed graphs ( equivalently quivers ) @xmath577 known as a * twist*. here @xmath578 is an orientation of a dynkin diagram of type @xmath201 , @xmath204 , or @xmath23 .",
    "such twists were recently studied by galashin and pylyavskyy in @xcite as part of their classification of zamolodchikov periodic quivers . such quivers and their associated cluster algebras",
    "have the property that one can define certain sequences of mutations such that their compositions with one another satisfy the coxeter relations of @xmath578 , when thought of as an action on cluster variables .",
    "as pointed out to us by pylyavskyy , the @xmath0 quiver is an example of such a quiver , in particular this is a twist of the weyl group affine @xmath71 .",
    "the relevant coxeter relations were seen in ( [ eq : tau_relations ] ) .",
    "this thus motivates an exploration for combinatorial formulas for cluster variables associated to the quivers constructed as the twists of other weyl groups or other zamolodchikov periodic quivers .",
