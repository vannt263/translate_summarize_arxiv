    "discovery strategies for light , color singlet technipions at hadron colliders have been investigated .",
    "as pointed out by eichten and lane@xcite they can be copiously produced through @xmath1-channel technirho production : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 ; and through @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 .",
    "the modes where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are produced and subsequently detected in their leptonic decays are straightforward and largely free of background ; see for example the atlas technical proposal@xcite . in this study",
    ", the dijet decays of the technipion have been investigated : @xmath16 these will generally be expected to dominate as long as the @xmath17 and @xmath18 modes are kinematically accessible ; in topcolor models the top decay modes can remain forbidden even for larger masses .",
    "for definiteness the following process has been considered : @xmath19 with @xmath20gev and @xmath21gev .",
    "the signal is thus a @xmath14 ( reconstructed from lepton plus missing transverse energy ) together with two jets , with a resonance in the dijet mass @xmath22 .",
    "the backgrounds are @xmath2jets and @xmath23 .",
    "( the latter has not yet been included in the study since it is small compared with the @xmath2jets process for @xmath24 jets , even if single @xmath3-tagging is applied ) .",
    "the signal cross sections are large : about 5  pb at the tevatron , and 35  pb at the lhc@xcite .",
    "the main issue is therefore dijet mass resolution and @xmath3-tagging .",
    "signal and background events were simulated using isajet .",
    "the signal topology was generated using the tcolor process with the @xmath25 final state ; the @xmath15 mass was set to @xmath26 and the decay to @xmath27 was forced .",
    "detector acceptance and resolution were modelled using a fast simulation@xcite .",
    "energy was deposited in cells of size @xmath28 and was smeared for detector resolution : @xmath29 for em , and @xmath30 for hadronic energy .",
    "transverse shower spreading and calorimeter leakage were also modeled .",
    "jets were found ( up to @xmath31 ) from the calorimeter towers using a cone of @xmath32 .",
    "missing transverse energy was calculated from the sum of the calorimeter towers over @xmath33 .",
    "events were selected which satisfied the following criteria :    * a good @xmath34 candidate , defined as : * * lepton with @xmath35  gev / c , @xmath36 , and isolated ( transverse energy within @xmath37 less than 10% of the lepton @xmath38 ) ; * * @xmath39gev * * transverse mass @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41  gev ; * at least two jets with @xmath42  gev and @xmath43 .",
    "the lepton was required to be central , since ( as fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_e ] shows ) this gives some improvement in signal - to - background .",
    "for @xmath3-tagging it was assumed that single tagging would be performed with an efficiency of 50% and a mistag rate of 1% for light quark jets .",
    "the cross sections obtained for the tevatron and lhc are listed in table  [ table ] .",
    "it will be seen that the signal - to - background ratio for this process is rather better at the tevatron .",
    "figure  [ fig : jjmass ] shows the invariant mass distribution obtained for the leading jet pair in signal events .",
    "the peak has a resolution of about 15  gev with tails from jet combinatorics .",
    ".cross sections for signal and @xmath2jets background . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : tev1 ] shows the invariant mass distribution obtained for signal and background at the tevatron , before @xmath3-tagging . once @xmath3-tagging is applied , the signal becomes much more apparent , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tev2 ] . a clear excess is visible with @xmath44 in the peak , and could easily be discovered in run ii with 2  fb@xmath45 . for comparison ,",
    "[ fig : lhc2 ] shows the situation at the lhc after @xmath3-tagging .",
    "we note that there are significant differences in kinematic distributions between signal and background events .",
    "cuts on these distributions may be used to further improve the background rejection , or they may be used as a way to confirm the presence of a signal by ( for example ) observing differences in these variables as a function of dijet mass .",
    "some variables of interest are :    * transverse momentum of the leading dijet system , @xmath46 ; * pseudorapidity of the leading dijet system , @xmath47 ; * @xmath48 between the leading two jets ; * dijet asymmetry @xmath49 .    the dijet pseudorapidity and asymmetry do not offer much discriminating potential , but the @xmath48 and transverse momentum of the dijet system are distinctly different between signal and background , as can be seen from fig.[fig : kinematics ] .",
    "requiring , for example , @xmath50 , and @xmath51  gev / c retains 60% of the signal while rejecting 74% of the @xmath2jets background .",
    "light , color - singlet technipions , produced in association with a vector boson through s - channel technirho production , can be discovered at hadron colliders in the @xmath27 decay mode .",
    "the signal to background ratio is somehat better at the tevatron but this physics can also be addressed at the lhc .",
    "tagging of @xmath3-quarks is important to reduce the @xmath2jets background .",
    "the kinematic properties of signal and background events are significantly different and simple cuts can be used to further improve the signal to background ratio .",
