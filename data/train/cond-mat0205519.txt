    "however , in such previously reported cases as caru@xmath40ti@xmath2o@xmath8 and sr@xmath0ru@xmath40ti@xmath2o@xmath5 , the dopant was substituted on the ruthenium site .",
    "thus those substitutions could be expected to strongly perturb the ru - o network . in the present study ,",
    "the transition metal dopants preferentially replace bismuth in bi@xmath0ru@xmath0o@xmath3 .",
    "our magnetic data indicates that the ruthenium and bismuth sublattices in bi@xmath0ru@xmath0o@xmath3  are magnetically independent , and therefore the metal substitutions represent a second - order perturbation of the ru - o lattice , which was not effective in causing a crossover to the ferromagnetic state . in caruo@xmath8 ,",
    "conversely , a - site substitution does induce ferromagnetism even though it is not a direct perturbation of the ru - o lattice.@xcite therefore ruthenium oxides in the pyrochlore geometry appear to be far from the ferromagnetic instability observed in the perovskites , and such instability is not a broadly general characteristic of ruthenium oxide compounds .",
