    "turbulence is an important ingredient for understanding the properties and characteristics of molecular clouds and star - forming regions .",
    "turbulent gas motions are highly supersonic as indicated by the superthermal line widths ubiquitously observed throughout molecular clouds ( williams , blitz & mckee 2000 ) .",
    "these motions carry enough energy to halt global collapse and act as stabilizing agent for the entire cloud .",
    "however , it can be shown that interstellar turbulence decays quite rapidly on time scales of the order of the free - fall time of the system ( mac  low et al .",
    "1998 , stone , ostriker & gammie 1998 , padoan & nordlund 1999 ) . to explain the observed long life times , turbulence in molecular clouds must be constantly driven ( gammie & ostriker 1996 , mac  low 1999 ) . the interplay between self - gravity on the one hand ( leading to local collapse and star formation ) and turbulent gas motion on the other hand ( trying to prevent this process ) plays a key role in determining the structure of molecular clouds .",
    "altogether , understanding the characteristics of compressible , supersonic , and constantly replenished turbulence in self - gravitating media is an important ingredient for an adequate description of molecular clouds dynamics . and",
    "vice versa , from analyzing the spatial and dynamical structure of molecular clouds we can gain insight into the phenomenon of turbulence ( for an overview over interstellar turbulence see franco & carraminana 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , a complete and comprehensive theory of turbulence does not exist . due to the enormous complexity of the problem",
    ", progress has been slow since kolmogorov s pioneering work in 1941 , where he derived simple scaling laws for incompressible , stationary , and homogeneous turbulence by postulating a self - similar energy cascade downwards from the driving scale to the dissipation range .",
    "most effort has since been put in finding an adequate closure procedure , i.e.  in finding a way to express the highest - order correlation in the hierarchy of equations governing turbulent motion ( for an excellent overview see lesieur 1997 ; also boratav , eden & erzan 1997 ) .",
    "however , a satisfying description of turbulence has yet to be found .",
    "correlation and distribution functions of dynamical variables are frequently deployed for characterizing the kinematical properties of turbulent molecular clouds . besides using 2-point statistics ( e.g.  scalo 1984 , kleiner & dickman 1987 , kitamura et al .",
    "1993 , miesch & bally 1994 , larosa , shore & magnani 1999 ) , many studies have hereby concentrated on 1-point statistics , namely on analyzing the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the ( column ) density and of dynamical observables , e.g.  of the centroid velocities of molecular lines and their increments .",
    "the density pdf has been used to characterize numerical simulations of the interstellar medium by vzquez - semadeni ( 1994 ) , padoan , nordlund , & jones ( 1997 ) , passot , & vzquez - semadeni ( 1998 ) and scalo et al .",
    "velocity pdf s for several star - forming molecular clouds have been determined by miesch & scalo ( 1995 ) and miesch , scalo & bally ( 1998 ) .",
    "lis et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) analyzed snapshots of a numerical simulation of mildly supersonic , decaying turbulence ( without self - gravity ) by porter , pouquet , & woodward ( 1994 ) and applied the method to observations of the @xmath0-ophiuchus cloud .",
    "altogether , the observed pdf s exhibit strong non - gaussian features , they are often nearly exponential with possible evidence for power - law tails in the outer parts .",
    "this disagrees with the nearly gaussian behavior typically found in experimental measurements and numerical models of incompressible turbulence .",
    "the observed centroid velocity _ increment _ pdf s are more strongly peaked and show stronger deviations from gaussianity than numerical models of incompressible turbulence predict .",
    "furthermore , the spatial distribution of the largest centroid velocity differences ( determining the tail of the distribution ) appears ` spotty ' across the face of the clouds ; there is no convincing evidence for filamentary structure .",
    "miesch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclude that turbulence in molecular clouds involves physical processes that are not adequately described by incompressible turbulence or mildly supersonic decay simulations ( see also mac  low & ossenkopf 2000 ) .",
    "it is the principal goal of this paper to extend previous determinations of pdf s from numerical models into a regime more applicable for interstellar turbulence by ( 1 ) by calculating fully supersonic flows , ( 2 ) by including self - gravity , and ( 3 ) by incorporating a ( simple analytic ) description of turbulent energy input . for comparison with molecular cloud observations ,",
    "i discuss the dynamical properties of decaying and stationary ( i.e.  driven ) , supersonic , isotropic turbulence in self - gravitating isothermal gaseous media .",
    "the pdf s for the density , for the line centroid velocity and for their increments are derived as function of time and evolutionary state of the turbulent model .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section  [ sec : remarks ] introduces and defines the statistical tools applied in the current study .",
    "it is followed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] by a description of the numerical scheme used to compute the time evolution of the turbulent flows .",
    "[ sec : init ] shows that already simple variance effects in random gaussian fields are able to introduce strong _ non_-gaussian distortions to the pdf s which makes a clear - cut interpretation difficult .",
    "section [ sec : decay - non - grav ] contains the analysis of decaying , initially highly supersonic turbulence without self - gravity .",
    "this effect is then added to the simulations presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : decay - with - gravity ] .",
    "the model most relevant for molecular cloud dynamics is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : driven - with - gravity ] .",
    "it includes a simple driving term to replenish the turbulent cascade . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] all results are summarized .",
    "the kolmogorov ( 1941 ) approach to incompressible turbulence is a purely phenomenological one and assumes the existence of a stationary turbulent cascade .",
    "energy is injected into the system at large scales and cascades down in a self - similar way . at the smallest scales",
    "it gets converted into heat by molecular viscosity .",
    "the flow at large scales is essentially inviscid , hence for small wave numbers the equation of motion is dominated by the advection term .",
    "if the stationary state of fully developed turbulence results from random external forcing then one navely expects the velocity distribution in the fluid to be gaussian on time scales larger than the correlation time of the forcing , irrespectively of the statistics of the forcing term which follows from the central limit theorem .",
    "however , the situation is more complex ( e.g.  frisch 1995 , lesieur 1997 ) .",
    "one of the most striking ( and least understood ) features of turbulence is its intermittent spatial and temporal behavior .",
    "the structures that arise in a turbulent flow manifest themselves as high peaks at random places and at random times .",
    "this is reflected in the pdf s of dynamical variables or passively advected scalars .",
    "they are sensitive measures of deviations from gaussian statistics .",
    "rare strong fluctuations are responsible for extended tails , whereas the much larger regions of low intensity contribute to the peak of the pdf near zero ( for an analytical approach see e.g. forster , nelson & stephens 1977 , falkovich & lebedev 1997 , chertkov , kolokolov & vergassola 1997 , balkovsky et al .  1997 , balkovsky & falkovich 1998 ) . for incompressible turbulence",
    "the theory predicts velocity pdf s which are mainly gaussian with only minor enhancement at the far ends of the tails . the distribution of velocity _ differences _ ( between locations in the system separated by a given shift vector @xmath1 ) is expected to deviate considerably from being normal and is likely to resemble an exponential .",
    "this finding is supported by a variety of experimental and numerical determinations ( e.g.  kida & murakami 1989 , vincent & meneguzzi 1991 , jayesh & warhaft 1991 , she 1991 , she , jackson & orszag 1991 , cao , chen , & she 1996 , vainshtein 1997 , lamballais , lesieur , & mtais 1997 , machiels & deville 1998 ) .",
    "compressible turbulence has remained to be too complex for a satisfying mathematical analysis .",
    "it is not clear how to relate the analytical work on incompressible turbulence to molecular clouds .",
    "in addition to the fact that interstellar turbulence is highly supersonic and self - gravitating , there are also observational limitations . unlike the analytical approach or numerical simulations , molecular cloud observations allow access only to dimensionally reduced information .",
    "velocity measurements are possible only along the line - of - sight , and the spatial structure of a cloud is only seen in projection onto the plane of the sky , i.e.  as variations of the column density .",
    "although some methods can yield information about the 3-dimensional spatial structure of the cloud ( see stutzki & gsten 1990 , williams , de  geus , & blitz 1994 ) , the result is always model dependent and equivocal ( see also ballesteros - paredes , vzquez - semadeni , & scalo 1999 ) .    a common way of obtaining knowledge about the velocity structure of molecular clouds is to study individual line profiles at a large number of various positions across the cloud . in the optical thin case line shapes are in fact histograms of the radial velocities of gas sampled along the telescope beam .",
    "falgarone & phillips ( 1990 ) and falgarone et al .  (",
    "1994 ) showed that line profiles constructed from high - sensitivity co maps exhibit non - gaussian wings and attributed this to turbulent intermittency ( see also falgarone et al .",
    "1998 on results from the iram - key project ) .",
    "dubinski , narayan , & phillips ( 1995 ) demonstrated that non - gaussian line profiles can be produced from _ any _ gaussian random velocity field if variance effects become important ( which is always the case for very steep or truncated power spectra ) .",
    "they concluded that non - gaussian line profiles do not provide clear evidence for intermittency .",
    "another method of inferring properties of the velocity distribution in molecular clouds is to analyze the pdf of line centroid velocities obtained from a large number of individual measurements scanning the entire projected surface area of a cloud ( miesch & scalo 1995 , lis et al .",
    "1998 , miesch et al .  1998 ) .",
    "each line profile ( i.e. the pdf _ along _ the line - of - sight ) is collapsed into one single number , the centroid velocity , and then sampled _ perpendicular _ to the line - of - sight .",
    "hence , the two functions differ in the direction of the sampling and in the quantity that is considered .",
    "a related statistical measure is the pdf of centroid velocity increments , it samples the velocity differences between the centroids for line measurements which are offset by a given separation . the observational advantage of using centroid and increment pdf s is , that the line measurements can typically be taken with lower sensitivity as only the centroid has to be determined instead of the detailed line shape .",
    "these measures are also less dependent on large - scale systematic motions of the cloud and they are less effected by line broadening due to the possible presence of warm dilute gas .",
    "however , to allow for a meaningful analysis of the pdf s especially in the tails , the number of measurements needs to be very large and should not be less than about 1000 . in order to sample the entire volume of interstellar clouds ,",
    "the molecular lines used to obtain the pdf s are optically thin .",
    "i follow this approach in the present investigation and use a mass - weighted velocity sampling along the line - of - sight to determine the line centroid .",
    "this zero - opacity approximation does not require any explicit treatment of the radiation transfer process .",
    "the observed pdf s are obtained from _",
    "averaged _ quantities ( from column densities or line centroids ) . to relate these observational measures to quantities relevant for turbulence theory ,",
    "i.e.  to the full 3-dimensional pdf , numerical simulations are necessary as only they allow unlimited access to all variables in phase space . a first attempt to do this",
    "was presented by lis et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 ) who analyzed a simulation of mildly supersonic decaying hydrodynamic turbulence by porter et al .",
    "since their model did neither include self - gravity nor consider flows at high mach number or mechanisms to replenish turbulence , the applicability to the interstellar medium remained limited .",
    "this fact prompts the current investigation which extends the previous ones by calculating _",
    "highly supersonic flows _ , and by including _ self - gravity _ and a _",
    "turbulent driving scheme_. the current study does not consider magnetic fields .",
    "their influence on the pdf s needs to be addressed separately .",
    "however , the overall importance of magnetic fields and mhd waves on the dynamical structure of molecular clouds may not be large .",
    "the energy associated with the observed fields is of the order of the ( turbulent ) kinetic energy content of molecular clouds ( crutcher 1999 ) .",
    "magnetic fields can not prevent the decay of turbulence ( e.g.  mac low et al .",
    "1998 ) which implies the presence of external driving mechanisms .",
    "these energy sources replenish the turbulent cascade and may excite mhd waves explaining the inferred equipartition between turbulent and magnetic energies .",
    "the one - point probability distribution function @xmath2 of a variable @xmath3 is defined such that @xmath4 measures the probability for the variable to be found in the interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "density pdf _ ( @xmath0-pdf ) discussed in this paper is obtained from the local density associated with each sph particle .",
    "it is basically the normalized histogram summed over all particles in the simulation , i.e.  a mass - weighted sampling procedure is applied .",
    "the _ line - of - sight velocity centroid pdf _ ( @xmath6-pdf ) is more complicated to compute .",
    "the face of the simulated cube is divided into @xmath7 equal - sized cells .",
    "for each cell , the line profile is computed by sampling the normal ( line - of - sight ) velocity component of all gas particles that are projected into that cell .",
    "the line centroid is determined as the abscissa value of the peak of the distribution .",
    "this procedure corresponds to the formation of optically thin lines in molecular clouds , where all molecules within a certain column through the clouds contribute equally to the shape and intensity of the line . to reduce the sampling uncertainties , this procedure is repeated with the location of the cells shifted by half a cell size in each direction . altogether",
    "about 20@xmath8000 lines contribute to the pdf .",
    "this is procedure is repeated for line - of - sights along all three system axes to identify projection effects .",
    "the _ line centroid increment pdf _",
    "( @xmath9-pdf ) is obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "however , the sampled quantity is now the velocity _ difference _ between line centroids obtained at two distinct locations separated across the face of the cloud by a fixed shift vector @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath9-pdf for a spatial lag @xmath10 is obtained as azimuthal average , i.e.  as superposition of all individual pdf s with shift vectors of length @xmath10 .",
    "also statistical moments of the distribution can be used to quantify the spread and shape of pdf s . for the current analysis",
    "i use the first four moments .",
    "mean value @xmath11 and standard deviation @xmath12 ( the 1 .  and 2 .",
    "moments ) quantify the location and the width of the pdf and are given in units of the measured quantity .",
    "the third and fourth moments , skewness @xmath13 and kurtosis @xmath14 , are dimensionless quantities characterizing the shape of the distribution .",
    "the skewness @xmath13 describes the degree of asymmetry of a distribution around its mean .",
    "the kurtosis @xmath14 measures the relative peakedness or flatness of the distribution .",
    "i use a definition where @xmath15 corresponds to a normal distribution .",
    "smaller values indicate existence of a flat peak compared to a gaussian , larger values point towards a stronger peak or equivalently towards the existence of prominent tails in the distribution . a pure exponential results in @xmath16 .",
    "gaussian random fields are statistically fully determined by their mean value and the 2-point correlation function , i.e.  by their first two moments , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "all higher moments can be derived from those .",
    "the 2-point correlation function is equivalent to the power spectrum in fourier space ( e.g.  bronstein & semendjajew 1979 ) .",
    "besides using moments there are other possibilities of characterizing a distribution .",
    "van den marel & franx ( 1993 ) and dubinski et al .",
    "( 1995 ) applied gauss - hermite expansion series to quantify non - normal contributions in line profiles .",
    "a more general approach has been suggested by vio et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who discuss alternatives to the histogram representation of pdf s .",
    "however , as astrophysical data sets typically _ are _ histograms of various types and as histograms are the most commonly used method to describe pdf s , this approach is also adopted here .",
    "sph ( _ smoothed particle hydrodynamics _ ) is a particle - based scheme to solve the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "the fluid is represented by an ensemble of particles , each carrying mass , momentum , and hydrodynamic properties .",
    "the time evolution of the fluid is represented by the time evolution of the particles , governed by the equations of motion which are supplemented by a prescription to modify the hydrodynamic properties . at any location",
    "these properties are obtained by averaging over an appropriate set of neighboring particles .",
    "excellent overviews over the method provide the reviews by benz ( 1990 ) and monaghan ( 1992 ) . for the current study",
    "i use sph because it is intrinsically lagrangian and because it is able to resolve very high density contrasts .",
    "another reason for choosing sph is the possibility to use it in combination with the special - purpose hardware device grape ( sugimoto et al .  1990 ,",
    "ebisuzaki et al .",
    "1993 ; and also umemura et al .  1993 ,",
    "steinmetz 1996 ) .",
    "this allows calculations at supercomputer level on a normal workstation .",
    "the code is based on a version originally developed by benz ( 1990 ) , and is used with a standard description of a von  neumann - type artificial viscosity ( monaghan & gingold 1983 ) with the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the linear and quadratic terms .",
    "the system is subject to periodic boundary conditions ( klessen 1997 ) and is integrated in time using a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg scheme , allowing individual time steps for each particle .",
    "furthermore , the smoothing volume over which hydrodynamic quantities are averaged in the code is freely adjustable in space and time such that the number of neighbors for each particle remains approximately fifty .",
    "when including self - gravity , regions with masses exceeding the jeans limit become unstable and collapse .",
    "once a highly - condensed core has formed in the center of a collapsing gas clump , that core is substituted by a ` sink ' particle ( bate , bonnell , & price 1995 ) which inherits the combined masses , linear and ` spin ' angular momenta of the particles it replaces .",
    "it also has the ability to accrete further sph particles from its infalling gaseous envelope .    for simulations of turbulent flows",
    "one also has to take into account that an explicit viscosity term is introduced in the sph method .",
    "this fact demands attention when studying dissipative processes , especially in the subsonic regime .",
    "the current study focuses on the properties of highly supersonic turbulent flows . in this regime ,",
    "direct comparison between sph and grid - based methods has proven the close correspondence of both methods ( mac  low et al .",
    "1998 , klessen , heitsch & mac  low 2000 ) .",
    "if one bears the above caveats in mind , the sph method calculates the time evolution of gaseous systems very reliably and accurately , and offers large spatial and dynamical flexibility .",
    "the numerical models discussed here describe isothermal gas .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are extended to include self - gravity ( in sec.s [ sec : decay - with - gravity ] and [ sec : driven - with - gravity ] ) and to incorporate a random turbulent driving mechanism ( in sec.[sec : driven - with - gravity ] ) .",
    "all physical constants are set to unity .",
    "the same applies to mass and length scales , i.e.  the total mass is @xmath19 and the simulated volume is the cube @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] . the mean density is thus @xmath21 .",
    "the initial configuration of all dynamical systems discussed in this paper is a homogeneous gas distribution with a gaussian velocity field . without turbulence ,",
    "the time evolution depends on one parameter , the _ ratio _ between internal and gravitational energy , @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity can be interpreted as dimensionless temperature and determines the number of thermal jeans masses contained in the system .",
    "molecular clouds are characterized by line widths which largely exceed the thermal broadening .",
    "the evolution away from the homogeneous initial state is thus strongly influenced by the adopted initial velocity distribution and depends on whether turbulence is decaying or driven",
    ". large turbulent kinetic energy can considerable slow down or even prevent the collapse of thermally jeans unstable gas .",
    "the situation is very complex and depends on the shape and strength of the turbulent velocity spectrum ( klessen et al .",
    "2000 ; see also see bonazzola et al .",
    "1992 and vzquez - semadeni & gazol 1995 for an analytical approach ) .    to generate and maintain turbulent flows gaussian velocity fields are introduced .",
    "the spatial variations of each component of the velocity vector @xmath23 are described as superpositions of plane waves with wave numbers @xmath24 , where the phase of each wave is random and sampled from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath25 .",
    "also the amplitude is random , but selected from a gaussian distribution centered on zero and with a width determined by the power spectrum @xmath26 .",
    "gaussian fields are isotropic and only depend on the absolute value of the wave vector @xmath27 .",
    "only waves in the range @xmath28 are considered . for large cut - off wave numbers",
    "@xmath29 the gaussian statistics is very well sampled .",
    "if only very few modes are used to generate the field , variance effects become strong and individual realizations of the field can deviate significant from the ensemble average ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : init ] ) .",
    "the field is then transformed back into real space and the resulting velocities are assigned to individual sph particles using the ` cloud - in - cell ' scheme ( hockney & eastwood 1988 ) .",
    "for the initial field , all velocities are multiplied by the appropriate factor to reach the desired rms mach number of the flow . in case of driven turbulence , this velocity field is also used to ` kick ' the sph particles at every time step such that a constant level of kinetic energy is maintained ( see mac  low 1999 )",
    "variance effects in poorly sampled gaussian velocity fields can lead to considerable _",
    "non_-normal contributions to the @xmath6- and @xmath30-pdf s .",
    "if a random process is the result of sequence of independent events ( or variables ) , then in the limit of large numbers , its distribution function will be a gaussian around some mean value .",
    "however , only the properties of a large _ ensemble _ of gaussian fields are determined in a statistical sense .",
    "individual realizations may exhibit considerable deviations from the mean .",
    "the effect is strongest when only few ( spatial ) modes contribute to the field or , almost equivalently , when the power spectrum falls off very steeply . in this case , most kinetic energy is in large - scale motions .",
    "this is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - pdf - init ] , it shows @xmath6-pdf s for homogeneous gas ( sampled by @xmath31 sph particles placed on a regular grid ) with gaussian velocity fields with power spectra @xmath32 which are truncated at different wave numbers @xmath33 ranging from ( a ) @xmath34 to ( d ) @xmath35 .",
    "each realization is scaled such that the rms velocity dispersion is @xmath36 .",
    "the figure displays the pdf s for the @xmath3- , @xmath37- , and @xmath38-component of the velocity .",
    "the pdf s of the strongly truncated spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v - pdf - init]a ) do not at all resemble normal distributions .",
    "the gaussian statistics of the field is very badly sampled with only very few modes .",
    "note that the pdf s of the same field may vary considerably for different velocity _ components _ , i.e.  for different _",
    "projections_. with the inclusion of larger number of fourier modes this situation improves , and in fig .  [",
    "fig : v - pdf - init]d the pdf s of all projections sample the expected gaussian distribution very well .",
    "a similar conclusion can be derived for @xmath9-pdf .",
    "this measure is even more sensitive to deviations from gaussian statistics .",
    "figure  [ fig : dv - pdf - init ] plots the @xmath9-pdf s for the same sequence of velocity fields . for brevity ,",
    "only the line - of - sight component parallel to the @xmath3-axis is considered .",
    "furthermore , from the sequence of possible @xmath9-pdf s ( defined by the spatial lag @xmath10 ) only three are shown , at small ( @xmath39 , upper curve ) , medium ( @xmath40 , middle curve ) , and large spatial lags ( @xmath41 , upper curve ) . sampling the gaussian field with only two modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dv - pdf - init]a ) is again insufficient to yield increment pdf s of normal shape .",
    "the velocity field is very smooth , and the line centroid velocity difference between neighboring cells is very small .",
    "hence , for @xmath39 the pdf is dominated by a distinct central peak at @xmath42 .",
    "the tails of the distribution are quite irregularly shaped .",
    "the situation becomes ` better ' when sampling increasing distances , as regions of the fluid separated by larger @xmath10 are less strongly correlated in velocity . for @xmath40 and @xmath41 the pdf s follow the gaussian distribution more closely although irregularities in the shapes are still present . in fig.s",
    "[ fig : dv - pdf - init]b and c the @xmath9-pdf s for medium to large lags are very well fit by gaussians .",
    "deviations occur only at small @xmath10 , the pdf s are exponential ( and the distribution for @xmath43 is still a bit cuspy ) .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : dv - pdf - init]d shows the three @xmath30-pdf s for the case where all available spatial modes contribute to the velocity field ( @xmath44 ) . the pdf s follow a gaussian for all spatial lags",
    "this behavior is also seen in the variation of the moments of the distribution as function of the spatial lag @xmath10 .",
    "applied to the above sequence of gaussian velocity fields , fig .",
    "[ fig : mom - init ] displays the dispersion @xmath12 and the kurtosis @xmath14 of the distribution .",
    "the corresponding models are indicated at the right hand side of each plot .",
    "the width of the distribution , as indicated by the dispersion @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mom - init]a ) , typically grows with increasing @xmath45 , reflecting the relative peakedness of the distribution at small lags .",
    "for example , the distribution ( a ) yields a slope of  0.3 in the range @xmath46 , and ( b ) leads to a value of 0.2 in relatively large interval @xmath47 .",
    "the effect disappears for the better sampled fields .",
    "typical values for that slope in observed molecular clouds are @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( miesch et al .",
    "1998 ) . versus the spatial lag @xmath10 . for a comparison with the present study ,",
    "their numbers have to be divided by a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , they use a relatively narrow range of @xmath10-values to compute the slope of the function ; larger intervals would on average tend to decrease these values ( see their fig .",
    "in addition , miesch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) applied spatial filtering to remove large - scale velocity gradients in the clouds .",
    "these would lead to steeper slopes .",
    "the fact that in the present study the functions @xmath12 and @xmath14 level out for large spatial lags @xmath10 is a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions which do not allow for large - scale gradients.[comment ] ] a direct measure of the peakedness of the distribution is its fourth moment , the kurtosis @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mom - init]b ) . at small lags",
    "@xmath10 , clearly the pdf s of model ( a ) are more strongly peaked than exponential ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "comparing the entire sequence reveals again the tendency of the pdf s to become gaussian at decreasing @xmath10 with increasing number of modes considered in the construction of the velocity field .    taking all together , it is advisable to consider conclusions about interstellar turbulence derived from solely analyzing one - point probability distribution functions from molecular clouds with caution .",
    "similar to what has been shown by dubinski et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for molecular line profiles , deviations from the regular gaussian shape found in @xmath6- and @xmath9-pdf s need not be the signpost of turbulent intermittency .",
    "gaussian velocity fields which are dominated by only a small number of modes ( either because the power spectrum falls off steeply towards larger wave numbers , or because small wave length distortions are cut away completely ) will lead to very similar distortions .",
    "in addition , the properties of the pdf may vary considerably between different projections .",
    "the same velocity field may lead to smooth and gaussian pdf s for one velocity component , whereas another projection may result in strong non - gaussian wings ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : v - pdf - xyz - decay - with - gravity ] ) .",
    "in this section the pdf s of freely decaying initially highly supersonic turbulence without self - gravity are discussed .",
    "they are calculated from an sph simulation with @xmath51 particles ( mac  low et al .",
    "1998 , model g ) .",
    "initially the system is homogeneous with a gaussian velocity distribution with @xmath52 in the interval @xmath53 .",
    "the rms mach number of the flow is @xmath54 .",
    "after the onset of the hydrodynamic evolution the flow quickly becomes fully turbulent resulting in rapid dissipation of kinetic energy .",

    "<S> turbulence is essential for understanding the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds and star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> there is a need for adequate tools to describe and characterize the properties of turbulent flows . </S>",
    "<S> one - point probability distribution functions ( pdf s ) of dynamical variables have been suggested as appropriate statistical measures and applied to several observed molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interpretation of these data requires comparison with numerical simulations . to address this issue , sph simulations </S>",
    "<S> of driven and decaying , supersonic , turbulent flows with and without self - gravity are presented . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , random gaussian velocity fields are analyzed to estimate the influence of variance effects . to characterize the flow properties , </S>",
    "<S> the pdf s of the density , of the line - of - sight velocity centroids , and of the line centroid increments are studied . </S>",
    "<S> this is supplemented by a discussion of the dispersion and the kurtosis of the increment pdf s , as well as the spatial distribution of velocity increments for small spatial lags . from the comparison between different models of interstellar turbulence </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that the inclusion of self - gravity leads to better agreement with the observed pdf s in molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the increment pdf s for small spatial lags become exponential for all considered velocities . however , all the processes considered here lead to non - gaussian signatures , differences are only gradual , and the analyzed pdf s are in addition projection dependent . </S>",
    "<S> it appears therefore very difficult to distinguish between different physical processes on the basis of pdf s only , which limits their applicability for adequately characterizing interstellar turbulence .    _ </S>",
