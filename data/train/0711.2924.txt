    "the field of fracture mechanics is becoming extremely broad with the occurrence of unexpected failure of weapons , buildings , bridges , ships , trains , airplanes , and various machines .",
    "there are two fundamental fracture criterions : the strain energy release rate ( i.e. , g theory ) and the stress intensity factor ( i.e. , k theory ) ; see arthur and richard ( 2002 ) .",
    "the experimentally determined stress intensity depends on the specimen size , and the fracture is accompanied by energy localization and concentration .",
    "+ localization is manifested by degradation of material properties with localized large deformations , and this feature often results in formation and propagation of macrocracks through engineering structures . due to the importance of localization phenomena in structural safety assessment ,",
    "much research has been conducted to resolve experimental , theoretical and computational issues associated with localization problems , as reviewed by chen and schreyer ( 1994 ) and chen and sulsky ( 1995 ) . for hyperelastic materials ,",
    "important progress has been made based on the gradient approach ; see aifantis ( 1984 ) and triantafyllidis and aifantis ( 1986 ) .",
    "however , there is still a lack of analytical results for three - dimensional boundary - value problems . in this paper , hence , we study the localization in a slender cylinder composed of an incompressible hyperelastic material subjected to tension , based on an analytical approach to solve the three - dimensional governing equations .",
    "we also intend to provide mathematical descriptions for some interesting phenomena as observed in experiments .",
    "+ jansen and shah ( 1997 ) conducted careful experiments on concrete cylinders by using the feedback - control method . from two test series ,",
    "the typical stress - displacement behavior for different height - diameter ratios with normal strength and high strength was obtained .",
    "it appears that the pre - peak segment of the stress - displacement curves agrees well with the pre - peak part of the stress - strain curves , but the post - peak segment shows a strong dependence on the geometric size ( i.e. , the radius - length ratio ) .",
    "more specifically , the longer the specimen is , the steeper the post - peak part of the stress - displacement curves becomes .",
    "also , they found that the width of the localization zone changes with the specimen size . in the experiment by gopalaratnam and shah ( 1985 )",
    ", it was found that the tangent value in the ascending part of the stress - strain curves seemed to be independent of the specimen size but in the post - peak part there was a softening region and no unique stress - strain relation .",
    "schreyer and chen ( 1986 ) studied the softening phenomena analytically based on a one - dimensional model .",
    "their results indicate that if the size of the softening zone is small enough ( in a relative sense ) , the behavior of displacement - prescribed loading is unstable , and the softening curves are steeper than those with a larger size of the softening region . here , we shall provide the three - dimensional analytical solutions to capture all the localized features mentioned above .",
    "+ another purpose of this research is to provide a method judging the onset of failure in a slender cylinder subjected to tension . here",
    ", we use the maximum - distortion - energy theory ( the huber - hencky - von mises theory ; see riley et al .",
    "2007 ) , which depicts there are two portions of the strain energy intensity .",
    "one is the portion producing volume change which is ineffective in causing failure by yielding , and the other is that producing the change of shape which is completely responsible for the material failure by yielding .",
    "+ by constructing the analytical solutions for localizations , it is possible to get the point - wise energy distribution . then , an expression for the maximum value of the strain energy can be obtained . with the huber - hencky - von mises theory",
    ", we can then establish an analytical criterion for identifying the onset of failure .",
    "+ mathematically , to deduce the analytical solutions for localizations in a three - dimensional setting is a very difficult task .",
    "one needs to deal with coupled nonlinear partial differential equations together with complicated boundary conditions .",
    "further , the existence of multiple solutions ( corresponding to no unique stress - strain relation ) makes the problem even harder to solve . here , the analysis is carried out by a novel method developed earlier ( dai and huo , 2002 ; dai and fan , 2004 ; dai and cai , 2006 ) , which is capable of treating the bifurcations of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "our results yield the analytical forms of the strain and stress fields , total elongation , the potential energy distribution and the strain energy distribution , which are characterized by localization phenomena .",
    "in particular , it is found that once the localization is formed its width does not change with the further increase of the total elongation , which is in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "we also provide a description for the snap - through phenomenon .",
    "+ the remaining parts of the paper are arranged as follows . in section 2 , we formulate the three - dimensional govering equations for the axisymmetric deformations of a circular cylinder .",
    "we nondimensionalize them in section 3 to identify the key small variable and key small parameters .",
    "then , in section 4 , a novel method of coupled series - asymptotic expansions is used to derive the normal form equation of the original system . by the variational principle , in section 5",
    ", we derive the same equation by considering the energy . in section 6 , with the help of the phase plane",
    ", we solve the boundary - value problems for a given external axial force and a given elongation , respectively . in section 7 , through an energy analysis",
    ", we determine the most preferred configurations and give a description of the snap - through phenomenon .",
    "also , an analytical criterion for identifying material failure based on the huber - hencky - von mises theory is discussed . finally , concluding remarks and future tasks are given in section 8 .",
    "we consider the axisymmetric deformations of a slender cylinder subjected to a static axial force at one plane end with the other plane end fixed .",
    "the radius of the cylinder is @xmath0 and the length is @xmath1 .",
    "we take a cylindrical coordinate system , and denote @xmath2 and @xmath3 as the coordinates of a material point of the cylinder in the reference and current configurations , respectively .",
    "the radial and axial displacements can be written as @xmath4 we suppose that the cylinder is composed of an incompressible hyperelastic material , for which the strain energy density @xmath5 is a function of the first two invariants @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the left cauchy - green strain tensor , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "moreover the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the deformation gradient and @xmath12 is the indeterminate pressure . if the strains are small , it is possible to expand the first piola - kirchhoff stress components in terms of the strains up to any order .",
    "the expressions for the stress components are very lengthy , and due to the complexity of calculations , we shall only work up to the third - order material nonlinearity .",
    "the formula containing terms up to the third - order material nonlinearity has been provided by fu and ogden ( 1999 ) : @xmath13 where + @xmath14 + @xmath15 is the pressure value in eq .",

    "a similar methodology has been developed to study nonlinear waves and phase transitions ( dai and huo , 2002 ; dai and fan , 2004 ; dai and cai , 2006 ) .",
