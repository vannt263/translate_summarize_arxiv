    "understanding the epoch of cosmological reionization has been a key challenge in modern observational cosmology . the gunn - peterson test with spectra of high - redshift ( high-@xmath12 ) quasars",
    "is an observational tool for detecting the reionization epoch , and suggests that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was reionized at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there is also observational evidence that neutral hydrogen still remains in the igm of the universe at @xmath14 , e.g. , studies with quasars @xcite and with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "recent analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) indicated the redshift of the cosmic reionization of @xmath15 by planck @xcite .",
    "galaxies associated with ly@xmath2 emission , i.e. , lyman-@xmath2 emitters ( laes ) are also valuable probes to infer the neutral hydrogen ( h i ) fraction @xmath16 of the igm .",
    "@xcite suggested the effectiveness of this concept from a theoretical viewpoint .",
    "observational studies indicated that the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of the lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) show a monotonic decline in number density at @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the lfs of laes show little change at @xmath19 , implying an increasing fraction of laes relative to lbgs with increasing redshift ; in turn , they show a significant decline at @xmath13 in the number density , e.g. , @xcite who presented a clear decrease in the ly@xmath2 lf at @xmath20 from the @xmath21 . this rapid decline in the ly@xmath2 lf",
    "can be attributed to a change in @xmath16 at @xmath13 .",
    "the neutral hydrogen in the igm could decrease observed ly@xmath2 photons from star - forming galaxies by resonant scattering@xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested an increase in the h i fraction from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and the estimated @xmath16 is 0.22 at @xmath23 .",
    "they suggested possible cosmic variance in the number density of laes across a @xmath24 sq.degree area by a factor of 2 to 10 depending on their nb921 magnitudes . @xcite",
    "inferred @xmath25 at @xmath23 from a different data set , suggesting existence of the cosmic variance in @xmath16 with a possible patchy reionization process in the universe .",
    "a caveat in investigating reionization with the lfs of galaxies is that the lfs are likely to be influenced by galaxy evolution .",
    "in contrast , the ly@xmath2 fraction , i.e. , the fraction of galaxies exhibiting strong ly@xmath2 emission of the total lbgs , has an advantage in that it should be less affected by galaxy evolution , especially in terms of the number density , than the ly@xmath2 lfs , which require comparison with the uv lfs @xcite .",
    "in addition , star formation activity and dust / metal content of galaxies which contribute to the equivalent width ( ew ) of ly@xmath2 , do not change rapidly even at @xmath26 compared to those at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath2 fraction at each redshift has been studied intensively to yield a complementary information to the cosmic reionization process @xcite .",
    "the studies by @xcite and @xcite suggested that the ly@xmath2 fraction of lbgs drops significantly from @xmath27 to @xmath18 in contrast to its monotonic increase at @xmath28 .",
    "their faint sample showed a more rapid decline than the bright sample .",
    "@xcite also studied the ly@xmath2 fraction at @xmath29 and discussed the decline in ly@xmath2 fraction at @xmath30 with the possibility of witnessing the ongoing cosmic reionization process at @xmath31 .",
    "a recent study with hubble space telescope ( hst ) slitless spectroscopy targeting gravitationally lensed clusters of galaxies ( glass ) also indicated that the number of laes at @xmath11 with respect to that of the lbgs is consistent with a lower probability of ly@xmath2 emission at @xmath29 than at @xmath14 @xcite .    while the relative number of laes is an effective tracer of the cosmic reionization state , a fair application would require consideration of several factors that may affect the observable ly@xmath2 emission from high-@xmath12 galaxies .",
    "the strength of ly@xmath2 emitted from galaxies may be affected by a combination of physical properties of galaxies and the transmission of the igm along the lines of sight .",
    "@xcite discussed the importance of the coupled effects by internal dust extinction and the geometry and kinematics of h i gas surrounding a galaxy , to determine the net ly@xmath2 photons that can escape from the galaxy .",
    "lbgs with low luminosities tend to have low metallicity or dust extinction , leading to a bluer uv color @xcite and likely association of strong ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "this may introduce a possible luminosity dependence of the ly@xmath2 fraction , as suggested in previous studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed a similar trend in the stellar mass dependence on the strong ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "observational studies suggested that lbgs with high uv luminosities tend to show a deficit in strong ly@xmath2 emission @xcite .",
    "based on spectroscopic observations of lbgs , @xcite reported that the ly@xmath2 fraction of lbgs with low uv luminosities is higher than that of those with high luminosities at @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the ly@xmath2 fraction ( @xmath32 ) rises as redshift increases over @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite supported this trend at @xmath33 based on a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ) sample .",
    "@xcite reported the same increase in ly@xmath2 fraction ( @xmath32 ) from @xmath34 to @xmath35 at bright magnitudes ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies have also reported detection of ly@xmath2 in a few sources in a similar luminosity range @xcite .",
    "the redshift above @xmath37 is an important epoch to understand the progression of reionization . in particular , it is of interest to investigate even brighter objects ( @xmath38 ) , i.e. , in environments in very massive dark matter halos .",
    "such massive halos are thought to evolve and form galaxies with strong clustering in an earlier epoch , and so are likely to host larger amounts of ionizing sources than less massive halos .",
    "therefore , it is expected that reionization would progress earlier in the environments around the massive dark matter halos than in other regions . however , despite intensive observational studies of the ly@xmath2 fraction at @xmath13 , only small numbers of the lbgs at @xmath29 are available . primarily due to limitations in the surveyed area and as brighter galaxies are rarer ,",
    "very little is known about the lbgs with very bright magnitudes .",
    "previous studies on the ly@xmath2 fraction were conducted only at uv magnitudes fainter than @xmath39 .",
    "thus , new deep and wide imaging and spectroscopic observations are indispensable to extend our knowledge of the bright magnitude regime .",
    "focusing on such uv - bright lbgs is also an effective approach that facilitates follow - up spectroscopy and allows determination of a reliable ly@xmath2 fraction at high redshifts .",
    "we have undertaken a new survey program to cover an unprecedentedly wide area by a deep imaging survey to detect uv - bright lbgs , followed by spectroscopic observation of some of the high-@xmath12 candidate galaxies . in this study , with the new spectroscopic sample from our survey program , we examine the ly@xmath2 fraction of lbgs at @xmath18 for very bright magnitudes .",
    "we also discuss the cosmic reionization at redshift 7 , providing a new constraint on the cosmic neutral h i fraction . in section  2 , we summarize the observations and data reduction in our @xmath4-band imaging survey program , and explain the method of target selection for lbg candidates at @xmath18 . section  3 describes the follow - up spectroscopy and properties of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the ly@xmath2 ew of our uv - bright galaxy sample is described in section  4 .",
    "we discuss the ly@xmath2 fraction of lbgs in section  5 , and its implications and interpretation regarding the state of the cosmic reionization in section  6 .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section  7 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the ab magnitude system @xcite , and assume a flat universe with @xmath40 .",
    "this paper aims to study the ly@xmath2 fraction based on lbg candidates at @xmath18 in the two common fields , cosmos / ultravista and sxds / ukidss - uds ( hereafter , ultravista and uds , respectively ) .",
    "these two survey fields represent a unique and powerful combination for studies on high-@xmath12 galaxies , where extensive multi - wavelength surveys at various facilities have been performed . in particular , the two ground - based deep near - infrared ( nir ) surveys ultravista @xcite and ukidss - uds @xcite provide an unprecedentedly wide and deep data set over an area of 1.65 sq.degree , making the two fields the most suitable for searches of bright lbgs at @xmath18 .    initially , however , only relatively shallow optical data sets were available in these fields , especially in the @xmath4 band , which is crucial for detecting the dropout feature of the lyman - break of the @xmath18 galaxies , e.g. , cosmos imaging @xcite by the subaru telescope covering the ultravista field in the @xmath41 and @xmath4 bands , with @xmath42 ( 5 @xmath7 , 3-arcsec aperture ) , and the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) @xcite located at the uds field in the @xmath43 , and @xmath4 bands to a depth of @xmath44 ( 5 @xmath7 , 2-arcsec aperture )",
    ". this situation motivated us to undertake a new observational campaign of ultra - deep imaging in the @xmath4 band in the two fields .",
    "we use a combined sample of the lbgs presented previously by @xcite , and a small addition to this work in the uds field as described below . in the following sections , we first present an overview of the entire @xmath4-band imaging campaign and data reduction . then , construction of the sample of lbgs in each field is explained .",
    "the deep imaging observations in the @xmath4 band were conducted with suprime - cam @xcite using the 8.2 m subaru telescope , which uses fully depleted ccds that were introduced in 2008 august .",
    "our survey plan was designed to cover the two target fields ultravista and uds ( @xmath45 sq.degree ) with eight pointings of suprime - cam , the field of view of which is @xmath46 sq.arcmin .",
    "figure  [ fig : pointing ] summarizes this pointing strategy .",
    "each pointing was planned to be integrated by 20 hours , divided into shorter exposures .",
    "the observing times were awarded as an open - use subaru intensive program ( pi : furusawa ; s08b-051 ) . originally , 20 nights were allocated over three semesters from 2008 october to 2009 november . to compensate for low completion rate due to poor weather conditions , etc .",
    ", another 16 nights were added by a regular open - use program and the observatory s discretionary time .",
    "final exposure times in each pointing , which are merged into the stacked images are 19.6 , 18.3 , 18.7 , and 20.8 hours for the ultravista field , and 11.7 , 16.2 , 11.7 , and 15.5 hours for the uds field .",
    "the @xmath4-band data obtained in this campaign are summarized in table  [ tab : zdata ] .",
    "data reduction of the @xmath4-band data performed to generate mosaic - stacked images from raw ccd images , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the sdfred2 software @xcite provided by the observatory was used .",
    "small fluctuations due to cross - talk between amplifiers of the ccd were corrected @xcite for the uds field data . the full width half - maximums ( fwhms ) of the point spread function ( psf ) of the stacked images before any convolution or transformation are 0.76 , 0.84 , 0.70 , and 0.82 arcsec for the ultravista field , and 0.75 , 0.81 , 0.78 , and 0.81 arcsec for the uds field .",
    "the celestial coordinates of the stacked images were calibrated with the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite , using sextractor and scamp .",
    "the resultant residuals of the determined coordinates from the usno - b1.0 catalog coordinates are on the order of 0.5 to 0.8 arcsec rms .",
    "this accuracy is good enough to perform image warping in section  [ sec : sample_selection_uds ] .",
    "magnitude zero points of the stacked images were determined with a standard star gd71 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the estimated depths in the @xmath4 band are 26.6 , 26.5 , 26.5 , and 26.8 ( 5 @xmath7 , 2-arcsec aperture ) for the ultravista field , and 26.3 , 26.6 , 26,6 , and 26.6 for the uds field .",
    "this data set is the deepest ever achieved in the @xmath4 band covering the entire two deep fields ( @xmath45 sq.degree ) .",
    "sample selection of @xmath18 galaxies in the ultravista field ( ra @xmath48 , dec .",
    "@xmath49 , j2000 ) was performed by @xcite , in an update to their initial work @xcite . in the field ,",
    "the ultravista dr2 provides nir photometry in the @xmath50 , and @xmath51 bands ( @xmath52 in ultradeep strips ; 5 @xmath7 , 1.8-arcsec aperture ) over a field of 0.91 sq.degree e.g. , figure  1 in @xcite .",
    "they combined the ultravista - dr2 data with the multi - waveband data including the cfhtls data in the @xmath53 bands ( @xmath54 ; 5@xmath7 , 2-arcsec aperture ) , and the final @xmath4-band data set ( table  [ tab : zdata ] ) provided by our imaging campaign .",
    "the high-@xmath12 candidates were selected based on a photometric redshift ( @xmath55 ) analysis applied to the sources detected in the @xmath56 or @xmath57 band under conditions with no detection in the @xmath58 or bluer bands .",
    "the resultant @xmath18 lbg sample in the ultravista field contained 19 candidates with @xmath59 , including 13 sources at @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite performed selection of @xmath18 lbgs in the uds field with photometric redshift analysis using the multi - waveband data set including the nir uds ( @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ) data and the optical sxds ( @xmath43 , and @xmath4 ) data .",
    "the data set also included the @xmath4-band data in our imaging campaign .",
    "however , the @xmath4-band data were of interim status , which consisted of 11.1 , 16.2 , 11.2 , and 15.5 hours slightly shallower in the uds1 and uds3 than the final data set listed in table  [ tab : zdata ] .",
    "additional @xmath4-band data have been obtained since their study .",
    "their lbg sample in the uds field included only two candidates with @xmath59 in contrast to the ultravista field .",
    "this relatively small number of high-@xmath12 candidates in the uds field may have been due to their requirement of significant detection in the @xmath67 band to avoid contamination by severe cross - talk from the ukirt / wfcam , which is only applied to the uds field . to add as many @xmath18 candidates to their lbg sample in this field as possible , in this study we used the combined data of the uds - dr10 , the sxds , and the updated @xmath4-band data set with the final depths ( table  [ tab : zdata ] ) .",
    "moreover , we applied a different sample selection to the data from that adopted in @xcite .",
    "our additional sample selection procedure is described below .",
    "we transformed the @xmath4-band stacked images in the uds field onto the same pixel coordinates as those of the @xmath56-band image .",
    "the images in the @xmath4 to @xmath66 bands were convolved with a single gaussian smoothing kernel to have the same fwhms ( 0.83 arcsec ) of the psf as the @xmath56-band images .    on the @xmath68 images , we ran sextractor ( ver .",
    "2.19.5 ) in double - image mode , with detection on the @xmath56-band image , to generate @xmath56-band detected multi - waveband catalogs ( @xmath69 ; 5 @xmath7 , 2-arcsec aperture ) , separately for each of the four pointings .",
    "we also removed sources located at pixels that were affected by low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) around the image edges , strong blooming , and strong halos of bright stars .",
    "we applied the following condition to the magnitude - limited sample of galaxies : ( 1 ) @xmath70 , ( 2 ) @xmath71 , and ( 3 ) complete dropout in all of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 bands .",
    "the first condition involves selection of the lyman - break , which together with the second condition minimizes contamination by galactic lt - dwarf stars .",
    "the third condition is to reduce contamination by lower - redshift galaxies .",
    "the resultant intermediate catalogs that satisfied the above conditions included 659 , 757 , 725 , and 700 sources in each pointing , respectively .    to remove false sources due to severe cross - talk on the @xmath74 images , we visually inspected every candidate source in the intermediate catalogs by eye , instead of requiring detection in the @xmath67 band . the false signals due to cross - talk appeared at positions of 191 pixels and/or its multiples from bright root signals in either the x- or y - axis , in each of the @xmath74 bands .",
    "these locations of cross - talk signals are inherited from the characteristics of the read - out electronics of ukirt / wfcam .",
    "if the candidate is an artifact of cross - talk , there must be a root signal that causes a series of cross - talk located at one of the positions of the multiples of 191 pixels from the candidate .",
    "importantly , a series of false signals decays monotonically with distance from the root signal , and also does not go beyond the quadrant area where the root signal is located .",
    "therefore , for every candidate source , we inspected 24 locations with distances of 191 and 282 pixels from the candidate on the x- and y - axes and grid points according to their combinations . in cases where there is any possible false signal at these locations",
    ", we excluded the candidate source as it is likely to be a false signal .",
    "we finally selected three new candidates of galaxies at @xmath11 in the uds field , which are listed in table  [ tab : uds_cand ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : stamps ] shows postage stamp images of the three sources .",
    "the three candidates , fh2 - 22303 , fh2 - 48620 , and",
    "fh4 - 42903 , have bright @xmath56 magnitudes ( 24.3 , 25.4 , 25.3 ; 2-arcsec aperture ) , or rest - frame uv magnitudes of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "photometric redshifts were derived using data from all of the broad bands from @xmath78 to @xmath66 bands based on the same method employed in @xcite .",
    "the resultant @xmath55 are @xmath79 , and @xmath80 for fh2 - 22303 , fh2 - 48620 , and fh2 - 42903 , respectively , supporting the high redshifts @xmath11 of the candidate galaxies .",
    "the associated errors correspond to their @xmath81 confidence levels .",
    "the best - fit spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the three sources are shown in figure  [ fig : photoz_fit ] .",
    "the first two sources ( fh2 - 22303 and fh2 - 48620 ) are brighter than all @xmath18 galaxies studied to date by spectroscopy for the ly@xmath2 fraction @xcite , if confirmed at @xmath18 .",
    "we confirmed that the number density of the combined data set ( @xmath82 ) of the sample by @xcite and the new 3 sources @xmath83 , is consistent with the uv lf presented by @xcite .",
    "we selected a total of 24 photometric sample of galaxies at @xmath84 .",
    "the sample consists of 19 galaxies in the ultravista field , 2 in the uds field presented by @xcite , and the 3 new galaxies in the uds field added in this study .    of the 24 lbg candidates at @xmath18 , 18 galaxies have very bright uv magnitudes of @xmath38 ( 14 galaxies in the ultravista , and 4 in the uds fields ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : spec ] , nine galaxies are spectroscopically followed up in this study , and seven of these belong to the very bright magnitude range .",
    "we conducted spectroscopic observations of nine sources of the 24 @xmath18 candidate galaxies selected in the previous section .",
    "these targets were chosen to include the four high - priority sources in the ultravista field , which were qualified as ` robust ' in @xcite , and all the five sources in the uds field .",
    "the ` robust ' targets were categorized based on results of @xmath55 analysis that did not accept either galactic stars or low-@xmath12 dusty galaxies in @xcite .",
    "a summary of the target sources is shown in table  [ tab : spec_fluxlimit ] .",
    "the ids of all the sources presented in @xcite are taken from table  2 of @xcite with the prefix ` b14- ' , containing four sources in the ultravista field and two in the uds field .",
    "the three sources with the prefix fh are the sources in the uds field added in this study .",
    "the observations were performed on the four nights of 2013 march 5 and 6 and 2014 october 24 and 25 , in multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode with subaru / focas @xcite .",
    "the vph900 grism combined with the oh58 order - sort filter was employed , covering a wavelength range of 7,500 to 10,450  giving a spectral resolution of @xmath85 ( 0.74  pixel@xmath86 ) with a slit width of 0.8 arcsec .",
    "this combination has the highest throughput at the target wavelengths among the 8-m class telescopes , especially at around @xmath87 , and is therefore highly suitable for the follow - up spectroscopy of ly@xmath2 emission at @xmath18 .",

    "the integrated times of 1.3 to 6 hours are devoted to each source ( table  [ tab : spec_fluxlimit ] ) , being split into individual exposures of 1,200 s , with a dithering width of 1.0 arcsec in the spatial direction between exposures .",
    "data analysis was performed in a regular manner using the standard pipeline focasred and mosred , implemented based on iraf and provided by the observatory .",
    "the raw spectrum data were first bias - subtracted and flatfielded by domeflat data .",
    "the pixel areas of target spectra were extracted by applying distortion correction based on a predefined pattern .",
    "then , wavelengths were calibrated based on night sky oh emission lines embedded in the 2d spectra , and sky background was subtracted from the 2d spectra .",
    "the reduced 2d spectra of individual exposures were shifted in the spatial direction by the dithering width and combined by taking median with 3-@xmath7 clipping of outlying pixels .",
    "flux calibration was performed on the stacked 2d spectra using spectrophotometric standard stars gd153 , g191b2b , and feige110 , with iraf tasks ` standard ' , ` sensfunc ' , ` fluxcalib ' , and ` extinction ' . with these tasks ,",
    "the atmospheric extinction was corrected assuming the atmospheric attenuation as a function of wavelength at maunakea , which was measured by cfht .",

    "the estimated slit - loss fractions ranged from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .      only a source b14 - 065666 displays a possible ly@xmath2 emission at @xmath11 , while the other eight sources showed no convincing emission line features to the s / n level of 3 , i.e. , no detection of ly@xmath2 .",

    "the completeness was calculated as the fraction of recovered sources among the input sources .",
    "the simulations were repeated 20 times and the completeness of each simulation was averaged to determine the effective completeness .",
    "we confirmed that the completeness values from @xcite and this study are consistent and the possible uncertainty if any should not change the following discussion .",

    "their simulation showed that over @xmath141 of simulated ly@xmath2 lines were recovered and the effect could be ignored at the same wavelengths as those in this study .",
    "moreover , even if b14 - 065666 were not a true ly@xmath2 detection , the following results on ly@xmath2 fraction would not be changed .",
    "figure  [ fig : xlya50_z ]  shows changes in the ly@xmath2 fraction ( @xmath142 ) over @xmath143 in the three different uv magnitude ranges : ( a ) faint ( @xmath134 ) , ( b ) bright ( @xmath133 ) , and ( c ) very bright ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "our data provide upper limits to the @xmath132 at @xmath18 in the very bright range for the first time .",
    "the following findings are obtained .",
    "first , in the ( c ) very bright magnitude range , our data point at @xmath18 possibly implies that the ly@xmath2 fraction at @xmath18 remains at a similar fraction or lower than that at @xmath27 , although the data points have large errors . in the same panel , the data points derived from @xcite may support a rapid increase in @xmath132 from @xmath145 to @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the ly@xmath2 fraction shows a significant decline at @xmath18 from @xmath27 , which is also seen in panels ( a ) and ( b ) at the fainter magnitudes .",
    "our results are consistent with this finding even in the very bright magnitude range .",
    "second , in comparison between panels ( b ) and ( c ) , our upper limit may indicate a weak trend of the ly@xmath2 fraction in the very bright magnitude range ( @xmath144 ) at @xmath18 consistently being at a similar level to that at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the possibility of a slightly higher ly@xmath2 fraction at @xmath18 in the ( c ) very bright range than in the ( b ) bright range also can not be excluded .",
    "this result seems to extend the relation at @xmath146 @xcite where the ly@xmath2 fraction at very bright magnitudes ( @xmath147 ) is at the same level or slightly higher than that of fainter magnitudes ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "a similar trend was suggested by @xcite in their bright magnitude range ( @xmath36 ) at @xmath14 .",
    "they suggested that the ly@xmath2 fraction for the bright sample may be significantly higher ( by @xmath149 or a factor of @xmath45 ) than that of the fainter sample @xcite .",
    "our finding may present some hints of a different trend from that suggested by @xcite , where the ly@xmath2 fraction for the faint ( ( a ) @xmath134 ) sample is consistently higher than that of the bright ( ( b ) @xmath133 ) sample at @xmath150 .",
    "finally , our upper limit may imply that the ly@xmath2 fraction in the ( c ) very bright magnitudes at @xmath18 is comparable to or lower than that in the ( a ) faint magnitude range at the same redshifts .",
    "the results in the previous section could provide only weak implications for the ly@xmath2 fraction of bright galaxies due to the current large errors .",
    "nevertheless , the trend seen in the ly@xmath2 fraction may possibly imply the existence of physical mechanisms that cause the lbgs with large luminosities to have an ly@xmath2 escape fraction similar to or higher than that of fainter lbgs ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "for example , @xcite discussed a possible excess at the bright end of the uv lf at @xmath18 by extrapolation of the conventional schechter function .",
    "the similar excess of the ly@xmath2 lfs has also been studied by @xcite .",
    "the excess in the very bright galaxies would require consideration of some special physical processes of galaxy formation , such as lack of an efficient mass - quenching mechanism @xcite in this epoch .",
    "@xcite implied that the feedback from a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of galaxies , where star formation rate is suppressed by outflows from a luminous agn , could be a mass - quenching mechanism .",
    "if the agn feedback is weak in the bright galaxies at @xmath18 , destruction of the h ii regions associated with star formation would be reduced , which supports higher luminosities of ly@xmath2 emission . at the lower redshifts , where the agn feedback is thought to work more efficiently , star formation in bright galaxies",
    "is more suppressed than in faint galaxies .",
    "the bright galaxies would have higher metallicity in the gas , and possibly more dust than in the counterparts in @xmath29 ; hence , the ly@xmath2 emission would be less efficient at the lower redshifts .",
    "in addition , the outflow from a galaxy , if any , may help an increase in the ly@xmath2 escape fraction , due to scattering of the ly@xmath2 lines , e.g. , @xcite . moreover , the very bright lbgs may be located in massive dark matter halos where the reionization progresses in an earlier epoch . this trend may lead to a higher transmission of the igm than in less massive halos .",
    "our result seems to be consistent with this trend .",
    "it is difficult to clearly interpret the observation that the ly@xmath2 fraction in the very bright range at @xmath129 is still higher than that in the bright range at the same redshifts",
    ". this could be in part accounted for by magnification of the sample galaxies due to gravitational lensing by their foreground galaxies @xcite , although the result can not be fully explained .",
    "we note that the above discussion depends on the uncertainty of measurements of the ly@xmath2 fraction at each redshift .",
    "as the error bars for the very bright sample galaxies at both lower redshifts reported by @xcite and at @xmath18 examined in this study are still large , we can not draw strong conclusions regarding the trend based only on the existing data , and further spectroscopic samples are necessary to obtain more reliable constraints .      now that we have derived the ly@xmath2 fraction in the unprecedentedly bright uv magnitude range , it is interesting to derive a new constraint on the neutral h i fraction ( @xmath16 ) in the cosmic reionization epoch . the cumulative probability distribution function ( pdf ) of ly@xmath2 @xmath115 , which is the probability of galaxies having a rest - frame @xmath115 larger than a given value , has been used to discuss the neutral h i fraction with faint spectroscopic samples of galaxies ( @xmath134 ) at @xmath18 in previous studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the neutral h i fraction may be 0.6 to 0.9 by comparing their ew - pdf with the model of @xcite , which is consistent with those suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath152 at @xmath18 with 22 relatively faint @xmath12-dropout galaxies ( @xmath153 ) , followed up by fors2 of the keck telescope .",
    "the slight difference in resultant neutral h i fraction from that of @xcite may have been due to difference in the magnitude ranges studied .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_ew0 ] shows the resultant ew - pdf of our new spectroscopic sample in the very bright uv magnitude range ( @xmath144 ) , compared with the results reported in the literature at the same redshift @xmath18 .",
    "we estimated the upper limit of ew - pdf at @xmath154 as follows .",
    "of our seven spectroscopic sample galaxies in the very bright magnitude range ( i.e. , without b14 - 118717 and fh4 - 42903 ) , the largest value of the observational upper limit of the @xmath115 was @xmath155 ( fh2 - 48620 ; table  [ tab : spec_fluxlimit ] ) .",
    "hence , we assume that the ly@xmath2 emission with @xmath156 , if any , would be detected in the seven spectroscopic data , but none of the seven sources shows such an emission line .",
    "therefore , the ew - pdf upper limit was derived by dividing the @xmath139-@xmath7 upper limit @xmath140 by the weighted total number of sample galaxies @xmath138 , to ew - pdf(@xmath157)@xmath158 ( filled square with downward arrow ) . here , we assume the non - detection of ew to 3-@xmath7 significance based on the noise statistics averaged over the studied wavelength range , which includes both areas with and without oh emission",
    ". this assumption may be slightly optimistic for this small ew range , as there is a chance that possible lines , if any , would be located in the relatively noisier oh emission bands .",
    "nevertheless , the essence of the following discussion is not changed by the uncertainty .",
    "although we assume @xmath18 for all the sample galaxies except @xmath5 of b14 - 065666 , our discussions in this study would also not be changed by making use of @xmath55 in estimation of @xmath115 .",
    "the typical difference in the upper limits determined by @xmath18 and @xmath55 is sufficiently small ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "we compare our data with the model prediction of ew - pdf presented by @xcite .",
    "their model was generated by computing pdf of a fraction of ly@xmath2 photons transmitted through the igm , combining models of galactic shell - wind outflows with large - scale semi - numeric simulations of reionization .",
    "they determined the reference model ew - pdf at @xmath27 ( @xmath160 ) to coincide with the median ly@xmath2 fraction ( @xmath161 ) at @xmath27 by @xcite .",
    "the data point at @xmath14 by @xcite in the very bright magnitude bin at @xmath162 ( open circle ) is also plotted in figure  [ fig : pdf_ew0 ] , which is still consistent with the reference ew - pdf within the error bars .",
    "we estimated the ew - pdf models for the various neutral h i fractions at @xmath18 by rescaling the reference ew - pdf ( see caption of figure  [ fig : pdf_ew0 ] ) .",
    "it is noted that the model of @xcite was calculated for the uv magnitude range @xmath133 , which is fainter than that of our data , due to the dark matter halo mass range considered in their calculation . nevertheless , inclusion of more massive halos , which is naively interpreted as the inclusion of uv - brighter galaxies , should produce little if any change in the result ( mark dijkstra , private communication ) .",
    "hence , we simply compare their model with our data .",
    "our upper limit would not contradict the model curves of @xmath163 .",
    "although this is a speculative comparison due to the large error and the small sample size , our data may possibly imply @xmath16 around @xmath164 to @xmath165 with the assumed escape fraction of @xmath166 .",
    "this @xmath16 is consistent with the report of @xcite in the fainter magnitude range .",
    "this result in the new very bright magnitude range may give further support to the findings discussed in previous studies that the reionization of the universe progresses rapidly from @xmath18 to @xmath167 .",
    "we examined the same comparison with the models at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath168 ) using the data points in @xcite , and found an inferred @xmath16 of @xmath169 .",
    "the combination of the results in the very bright and faint magnitudes may favor @xmath170 on the assumption of the escape fraction @xmath166 .    based on our data together with the previous results of @xcite and @xcite at the same redshift",
    ", the possibility of lower @xmath171 can not be excluded . as shown by the long - dashed curve ( magenta ) , evolution of the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies",
    "may contribute to the net change in ew - pdf .",
    "the possible increase in escape fraction may significantly reduce the ly@xmath2 fraction under the same igm transmission , which would lower the @xmath16 required to explain the observed ew - pdf at @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , @xcite mentioned the effect on their model of the possible existence of lbgs with ly@xmath2 absorption ( @xmath172 ) at high redshifts @xmath13 , which was reported by @xcite for @xmath17 lbgs .",
    "they suggested that the ew - pdf model would be shifted by @xmath173 by considering lbgs with @xmath172 .",
    "such a shift may explain the ly@xmath2 fraction ( @xmath174 , @xmath175 ) at @xmath176 of @xmath177 presented by @xcite .",
    "if this is the case at @xmath18 in this study , the possible @xmath16 range would be further decreased to @xmath178 or lower . however ,",
    "if we rescale the @xmath27 reference ew - pdf model to exactly match the data point of @xcite ( open circle ) , even higher h i fractions than the @xmath170 would be favored . together with the above discussion",
    ", the lack of any strong ly@xmath2 , such as @xmath179 , in our spectroscopic sample may imply a hint of the unlikely very low @xmath16 at @xmath18 .",
    "thus , further investigations to gain a better understanding of the physical properties and evolution of galaxies at high redshifts are necessary to provide stringent constraints on @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the number of spectroscopic samples of galaxies is still limited , and therefore future efforts to increase the size of the sample from low to high luminosity ranges , for reliably determining the ly@xmath2 fraction will be indispensable .",
    "we conducted a search for uv - bright lbgs in two legacy survey fields , ultravista and ukidss - uds , which cover an area of 1.65 sq.degree ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "very deep imaging observations on the two survey fields have been undertaken in the @xmath4 band ( @xmath181 ; 5@xmath7 , 2-arcsec aperture ) with subaru / suprime - cam .",
    "we performed selection of @xmath18 candidates in the uds field from the multi - waveband catalogs ( @xmath182 ; 5@xmath7 ) with the updated @xmath4-band data , based on the red color in @xmath99 , combined with relatively mild to red color in @xmath183 , and dropout in all optical bands . in the uds field , we chose three candidates of possible uv - bright galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "the 19 candidate sources in the ultravista field and two sources in the uds field at @xmath84 presented by @xcite were combined with the three new sources in the uds field , yielding 24 targets in total .",

    "based on the upper limits of the ly@xmath2 ew , the 1-@xmath7 upper limits of ly@xmath2 fraction with thresholding @xmath185 ( @xmath132 ) at @xmath18 was derived for the brightest magnitude range studied to date ( @xmath0 ) .",

    "<S> we study the extent to which very bright ( @xmath0 ) lyman - break selected galaxies at redshifts @xmath1 display detectable ly@xmath2 emission . to explore this issue , </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained follow - up optical spectroscopy of 9 @xmath1 galaxies from a parent sample of 24 @xmath1 galaxy candidates selected from the 1.65 deg@xmath3 cosmos - ultravista and sxds - uds survey fields using the latest near - infrared public survey data , and new ultra - deep subaru @xmath4-band imaging ( which we also present and describe in this paper ) . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopy has yielded only one possible detection of ly@xmath2 at @xmath5 with a rest - frame equivalent width @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative weakness of this line , combined with our failure to detect ly@xmath2 emission from the other spectroscopic targets allows us to place a new upper limit on the prevalence of strong ly@xmath2 emission at these redshifts . for conservative calculation and to facilitate comparison with previous studies at lower redshifts , we derive a 1-@xmath7 upper limit on the fraction of uv - bright galaxies at @xmath1 that display @xmath8 , which we estimate to be @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this result may indicate a weak trend where the fraction of strong ly@xmath2 emitters ceases to rise , and possibly falls between @xmath10 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our results also leave open the possibility that strong ly@xmath2 may still be more prevalent in the brightest galaxies in the reionization era than their fainter counterparts </S>",
    "<S> . a larger spectroscopic sample of galaxies is required to derive a more reliable constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath11 based on the ly@xmath2 fraction in the bright galaxies . </S>"
