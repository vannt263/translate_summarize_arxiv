    "the search for signals of the deconfinement phase transition and thus evidence for the existence of a quark gluon plasma in nature was the main objective of the experimental study of nucleus  nucleus ( a+a ) collisions at high energies .",
    "recent results obtained in broad range of energy allowed to identify anomalies in the energy dependence of hadron production in central pb+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "they suggest that , in fact , the onset of deconfinement is observed and is located at the low cern sps energies @xmath15 gev @xcite . among basic observables used in this study",
    "are pion and kaon multiplicities and transverse mass spectra of kaons . in the identification of the effects related to the onset of deconfinement in a+a collisions",
    "a comparison with the corresponding results obtained in nucleon - nucleon ( n+n ) interactions plays a special role . in case of the study of energy dependence of pion and kaon multiplicities",
    "this comparison was done based on the existing compilations of the data on all inelastic proton - proton ( p+p ) , proton - neutron ( p+n ) and proton - antiproton ( p+@xmath4 ) interactions @xcite .",
    "a recently found @xcite anomaly in the energy dependence of the shape of transverse mass spectra of kaons produced in central pb+pb collisions raised already significant interest @xcite .",
    "however , the results on transverse mass spectra of kaons in n+n interactions were up to now not compiled and a detailed comparison with the corresponding a+a data was missing .",
    "the aim of our paper is to fill this gap . + the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 the existing data are reviewed and analyzed .",
    "the energy dependence of the spectra is presented and discussed in section  3 .",
    "the paper is closed by the summary , section  4 .",
    "most of the results on kaon transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) spectra in all inelastic p+p(@xmath4 ) interactions are obtained for @xmath18 mesons and we start our compilation from the review and analysis of these data .",
    "further on we compile and analyze data on charged kaon ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) production .    in most cases the original experimental papers present @xmath17 spectra in the form @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "from these results the transverse mass @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the particle rest mass ) spectra @xmath24 can be easily obtained ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "our compilation and analysis is limited to the low @xmath17 region , @xmath26  gev / c .",
    "first , it is because in this region the energy dependence of the @xmath21 spectrum of kaons produced in a+a collisions was studied .",
    "second , only in this region an exponential parameterization of the p+p(@xmath4 ) data as used for the analysis of a+a collisions @xcite @xmath27 is approximately valid .",
    "the spectra obey a power law behavior , @xmath28 , which is interpreted as due to hard ( parton ) scattering . ] in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] the inverse slope parameter @xmath7 and the normalization parameter @xmath29 are treated as free parameters and their values are extracted from the least square fits to the experimental spectra .",
    "the compiled @xmath17 spectra are measured either at midrapidity ( y@xmath30 ) or they are integrated over forward or backward hemispheres starting from midrapidity .",
    "the rapidity of kaons peaks at midrapidity [ 21 - 29 ] and thus the shape of the integrated spectra is dominated by the contribution from this region . in the following",
    "we do not distinguish between both types of measurements .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of @xmath1 mesons produced in all inelastic p+p interactions [ 21 - 29 ] are measured in fixed target , mostly bubble chamber experiments , at energies below @xmath31  gev . at higher energies , @xmath32  gev ,",
    "the measurements for p+@xmath4 interactions are performed at the sp@xmath4s collider @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 data come from the analysis of charged decays of @xmath18 mesons , @xmath18  @xmath33 .",
    "a characteristic feature of these results are relatively low systematic uncertainties and large statistical errors due to the small number of analyzed events .",
    "the summary of the data on @xmath0 spectra of @xmath18 mesons is given in tables 1 and 2 , where @xmath34 , the @xmath35 range selected for the analysis , the rapidity  ( y ) range in which the measurement was done and the reference to the original experimental papers are given .",
    "the @xmath21 spectra are plotted as a function of @xmath36 in fig .  1 .",
    "the normalization of the spectra is arbitrary .",
    "they are ordered from bottom to top according to increasing energy .",
    "the spectra displayed in fig .",
    "1 are fitted by an exponential function , eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , in the whole @xmath21 range ( @xmath37  gev / c@xmath38 ) as well as in two subintervals , the `` low@xmath21 '' interval ( @xmath39  gev / c@xmath38 ) and the `` high@xmath21 '' interval ( @xmath40  gev / c@xmath38 ) .",

    "the data on charged kaon spectra in p+@xmath4 interactions at the sp@xmath4s @xcite and the tevatron @xcite are compiled . in most cases",

    "no significant differences are seen between results obtained for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons as well as between data for p+p and p+@xmath4 interactions .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath7 parameter on @xmath34 was fitted by an expression : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fit parameters and @xmath34 is given in units of gev .",

    "the inverse slope parameters obtained form the fits performed in the `` low@xmath21 '' and `` high@xmath21 '' intervals are plotted as a function of collision energy in fig .",

    "the @xmath7 parameter for `` low@xmath21 '' interval is systematically lower than for the `` high@xmath21 '' interval . for the `` low@xmath21 '' interval",
    "the @xmath7 parameter is approximately independent of the collision energy , whereas in the `` high@xmath21 '' interval it seems to increase .",
    "the observed behaviour may be attributed to rapid development of the power law tail with increasing collision energy .",

    "the results on the @xmath7 parameter of kaons obtained for p+p(@xmath4 ) interactions are plotted as a function of @xmath34 together with the corresponding data for central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions at ags @xcite , sps @xcite and rhic @xcite .",
    "the data points for central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions and p+p(@xmath4 ) interactions were extracted from the fits performed in the whole @xmath21 interval . a different dependence is measured in pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions than in p+p(@xmath65 interactions . at all energies",
    "the @xmath7 parameter is significantly higher in pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions than in elementary interactions . in the case of heavy ion collisions a well developed plateau at sps energies is observed .",
    "there is no obvious sign of such behaviour for p+p(@xmath65 ) interactions , however , the precision of these data is low and they can not exclude anomalies similar to this observed for pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions .",
    "the compilation of the p+p(@xmath4 ) data performed in this paper was triggered by the observation of the anomalous energy dependence of the shape of transverse mass spectra of kaons measured in central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions and its possible relation to the deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "within statistical  hydrodynamic approach to a+a collisions the heavy ion data shown in fig .",
    "6 are interpreted as follows .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter increases strongly with collision energy up to the lowest cern sps energies ( @xmath66 gev ) .",
    "this is an energy region where the creation of confined matter at the early stage of the collisions is expected .",
    "increasing collision energy leads to an increase of the early stage temperature and pressure .",
    "this results in grow of the transverse collective flow velocity , @xmath67 , and temperature @xmath68 , at freeze  out .",
    "consequently the transverse activity of produced hadrons , measured by the inverse slope parameter , increases with increasing energy .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter is approximately independent of the collision energy in the sps energy range , @xmath69 gev . in this energy region",
    "the transition between confined and deconfined matter is expected to be located .",
    "the resulting modification of the equation of state `` suppresses '' an increase of both @xmath68 and @xmath67 , and this leads to the observed plateau structure in the energy dependence of the @xmath7 parameter .",
    "at rhic ( @xmath70  gev and 200  gev ) the @xmath7 is significantly larger than at sps energies . in the rhic energy domain",
    "the equation of state at the early stage becomes again stiff , the early stage temperature and pressure increase with collision energy .",
    "this results in increase of the transverse flow @xmath67 and , consequently , in increase of @xmath7 between sps and rhic energies .    within the above picture",
    "there are two basic differences between central collisions of heavy nuclei and p+p interactions .",
    "first , collective expansion effects are expected to be important only in heavy ion collisions , as they result from the pressure gradient generated in the dense interacting matter .",
    "the expansion leads to an increase of the @xmath7 parameter and consequently one predicts a lower values of @xmath7 in p+p interactions , where collective expansion is absent and hadrons are emitted directly from the fragmentation of strings , than in central a+a collisions .",
    "this qualitative prediction is independent of the state of matter created at the early stage of the collisions and thus it is valid at all collision energies .",
    "in fact , it is confirmed by the data compiled in this paper ( see fig .",
    "second , the stationary value of @xmath7 at sps energies is related to the modification of the equation of state of matter created at the early stage for mixed phase and thus relative suppression of the collective expansion .",
    "as the collective expansion is absent in p+p interactions and , in general , the applicability of statistical models is in question for elementary interactions , one does not expect to observe any anomaly in energy dependence of @xmath7 in p+p interactions .",
    "this prediction is not in contradiction with the data compiled in this paper .",
    "however , large experimental errors allow to exclude only relatively large effects .",
    "the string hadronic models ( fritiof @xcite , urqmd @xcite , hsd @xcite ) well describe results on @xmath7 for p+p interactions @xcite .",
    "models without rescattering ( see e.g. fritiof @xcite ) predict similar values of @xmath7 for p+p interactions and central a+a collisions .",
    "these approaches are obviously excluded by the data . the models with rescattering of initially produced strings and hadrons should , in general , lead to an increase of @xmath7 for central a+a collisions .",
    "surprisingly , it was recently found @xcite within hsd and urqmd models , that the rescattering only weakly influences shape of the transverse mass spectra of kaons .",
    "thus also these approaches significantly under - predict the @xmath7 parameter measured in central a+a collisions at all energies @xcite .    within microscopic picture of a+a collisions",
    "one may try to speculate whether a part of the observed increase of @xmath7 when going from p+p interactions to central a+a collisions is related to the higher excitation of nucleons in a+a collisions than in all inelastic interactions .",
    "the experimental results , which can shed light on this subject are poor , but nevertheless , at collision energies up to top sps energy they seem to contradict this hypothesis .",
    "relatively rich data on pion production in p+p interactions as a function of multiplicity of produced hadrons show that the mean transverse momentum ( and the @xmath7 parameter ) decreases with increasing multiplicity @xcite .",
    "independence of the shape of @xmath17 spectrum of kaons on multiplicity is suggested by the p+p results at 12 - 200 gev @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that at tevatron energies an increase of @xmath71 of pions and kaons with multiplicity is observed @xcite .",
    "we compiled and analyzed data on @xmath0 spectra of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons produced in all inelastic p+p and p+@xmath4 interactions .",
    "the spectra can be reasonably well described by a simple exponential parametrization @xmath6 in the whole analyzed @xmath21 interval ( @xmath72 0.85 @xmath73 ) .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath7 measured for @xmath18 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are similar .",
    "we do not observe any significant difference between data from p+p and p+@xmath4 interactions .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter increases monotonically with @xmath34 from @xmath9  mev at @xmath10  gev to @xmath11 mev at @xmath74  gev .",
    "this dependence can be parametrized as @xmath75  mev  +  @xmath76  mev  @xmath77 , where @xmath34 is given in units of gev .",
    "the @xmath7 measured in p+p ( @xmath4 ) is significantly lower than the corresponding measurement in pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions .",
    "also the shape of the energy dependence of @xmath7 on energy is different for central pb+pb collisions and p+p(@xmath4 ) interactions .",
