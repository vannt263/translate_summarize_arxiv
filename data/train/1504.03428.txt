    "the cosmological principle , which is one of the foundations in modern cosmology , says that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large enough scales @xcite .",
    "it is well consistent with the present observational data , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and planck satellite @xcite . until now , the cosmological observations are still in accordance with the cosmological constant plus cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model which is based on the cosmological principle .",
    "thus , the @xmath0cdm model becomes the leading model in modern cosmology .    despite the great successes it achieved , the @xmath0cdm model still faces certain challenges @xcite .",
    "as the improvements of accuracy , it is found from a large amount of observations that the universe might deviate from statistical isotropy .",
    "these include the alignment of low multipoles in the angular power spectrum of cmb temperature fluctuations @xcite , the hemispherical power asymmetry of cmb temperature anisotropy @xcite , the spatial variation of the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xcite , the large - scale alignment of the quasar polarization vectors @xcite , the large - scale bulk flow beyond the prediction of @xmath0cdm model @xcite , and so on .",
    "all of these phenomena arouse us to rethink the validity of the cosmological principle .",
    "if the cosmological principle is proven to be failed , the modern cosmology should be rewritten .",
    "due to their consistent absolute magnitudes , type - ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are regarded as the ideal distance indicators to trace the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in fact , they have been widely used to search for the anisotropic signals in the universe .",
    "especially , a statistic based on the extreme value theory shows that the gold data set is consistent with the isotropy @xcite .",
    "the study @xcite on the angular covariance function of supernova magnitude fluctuations is consistent with zero dark energy fluctuations by using the union2 compilation @xcite .",
    "a `` residual '' statistic shows that the isotropic @xmath0cdm model is not consistent with the union2 data with @xmath5 at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "there are no significant evidence for deviations from the isotropy in the anisotropic bianchi - i cosmology @xcite , bianchi - iii and kantowski - sachs metrics @xcite , and randers - finsler cosmology @xcite .",
    "the hemisphere comparison is used to study the union2 data and shows certain preferred directions @xcite . by dividing the union2 supernovae into 12 subsets according to their galactic coordinates ,",
    "a dipole of the deceleration parameter is preferred at more than @xmath7 level @xcite . by combining the data of union2 and gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "the isotropic @xmath0cdm model is well permitted @xcite while the anisotropic finsler cosmology is preferred at around @xmath7 @xcite . by using the data of union2.1 @xcite and gamma - ray bursts",
    ", a model - independent way shows a dipolar anisotropy at more than @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it has been found that there may be certain correlation between the fine structure dipole and the dark energy dipole @xcite .",
    "a fully - bayesian method was developed to remove the systematics in the union datasets and the anisotropic cosmology does not seem to be reflected @xcite .",
    "recently , a new sample of sne ia was released by the sdss collaboration , which is called the `` joint light - curve analysis '' ( jla ) compilation @xcite .",
    "compared to previous compilations such as union2 @xcite and union2.1 @xcite , the number of sne ia in the jla compilation is highly enlarged and the systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced .",
    "recently , the jla sne ia have been used to probe the anisotropic hubble diagram in bianchi type i cosmology @xcite and test the cosmological principle @xcite .",
    "however , the work @xcite did not consider the full covariance matrix between sne ia . in this paper , we use the jla compilation to restudy the anisotropic hubble diagram of the universe .",
    "unlike certain previous works which have neglected the correlations between any two sne ia , we make use of the full covariance matrix to construct the likelihood ( or chi - square ) . in addition",
    ", we use the method of mcmc sampling in our analysis .",
    "it has been shown that the statistical significance of the previously claimed evidence for a preferred direction could be highly lowered if the full covariance matrix of sne ia is considered in the union2 compilation @xcite .",
    "we want to see whether the anisotropic signals in the accelerated expansion of the universe still exist in the newly released jla compilation .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : modelsandmethodology ] , we briefly introduce the jla dataset , and present the anisotropic cosmological models and the numerical method used in our analysis . in section [ sec : results ] , we give constraints on the anisotropic amplitudes and directions for the anisotropic expansion of the universe .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the anisotropic expansion of the universe can be induced by assuming that the dark energy has anisotropic repulsive force @xcite , or the background spacetime has a certain preferred direction @xcite , and so on . in this paper , we assume a dipole modulation to describe the universe deviating from the isotropic background .",
    "phenomenologically , the direction - dependent distance modulus can be given as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the amplitude of the dipole modulation , @xmath10 is the dipole direction , @xmath11 is the unit 3-vector pointing towards the supernova , and @xmath12 denotes the theoretical distance modulus predicted by the isotropic @xmath0cdm , @xmath4cdm or cpl models . here",
    "the anisotropic amplitude @xmath9 is assumed to be a constant over the whole redshift range . in the galactic coordinates",
    ", the dipole direction @xmath10 can be parameterized as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the longitude and latitude , respectively .",
    "in such a parametrization , we have @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the unit vectors along the axes of a cartesian coordinates system .",
    "the position of the @xmath20th supernova with galactic coordinates @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 .    in the spatially - flat isotropic background spacetime",
    ", we can express the luminosity distance @xmath23 of a supernova in terms of the redshift @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hubble constant , and @xmath27 is a function of redshift .",
    "the isotropic distance modulus @xmath12 can be given by @xmath28 in equation ( [ luminositydistance ] ) , the quantity @xmath27 is a function of redshift @xmath24 .",
    "the expression of @xmath27 depends on a specific cosmological model . in the @xmath0cdm model",
    ", it can be expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy density of matter today . in the @xmath4cdm model , it can be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the equation of state of dark energy . in the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl )",
    "parametrization @xcite , the equation of state of dark energy is redshift - dependent , and it is parameterized by @xmath33 . in this case , @xmath27 can be expressed as @xmath34    in this paper , we use the most recently published jla compilation @xcite of sne ia to constrain the anisotropy of the universe .",
    "the jla compilation consists of 740 well - calibrated sne ia in the redshift range of @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "it is a collection of several low - redshift samples , all three seasons from the sdss - ii , three years from snls , and a few high - redshift samples from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "all of the sne ia have high - quality light curves , so their distance moduli can be abstracted with high precision .",
    "the positions of sne ia in the sky of equatorial coordinates system can be found at the website of iau central bureau for astronomical telegrams . to compare with others work",
    ", we transform the positions of sne ia into the galactic coordinates .    from the observational point of view",
    ", the distance modulus of a sn ia can be abstracted from its light curve through the empirical linear relation @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the observed peak magnitude in rest frame @xmath38 band , @xmath39 is the absolute magnitude depending on the host galaxy properties complexly , @xmath40 is the time stretching of the light curve , and @xmath41 is the supernova color at maximum brightness .",
    "the three light - curve parameters @xmath37 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are different from one supernova to other one and can be derived directly from the light curves .",
    "the two nuisance parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are assumed to be constants for all the supernovae .    for the jla samples ,",
    "the isotropic luminosity distance of a supernova can be given as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the cmb frame redshift and heliocentric redshift , respectively .",
    "then we can obtain the anisotropic distance modulus @xmath47 in equation ( [ muth ] ) . using the observed distance modulus @xmath48 in equation ( [ muobs ] )",
    ", the anisotropic cosmological models can be fitted to the jla dataset by using the chi - square as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the covariance matrix of @xmath48 , and it is presented in @xcite .    in order to directly compare with previous works ,",
    "we also apply our method to the union2 @xcite dataset . the union2 data set consists of 557 sne ia with well - observed redshift in the range of @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the distance moduli and their uncertainties are extracted from the salt2 light - curve fitter .",
    "the directions of sne ia are well localized in the sky of the equatorial coordinates @xcite . the data in union2 are usually assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "thus , the chi - square of union2 is simplified to @xmath52 where the summation runs over all the sne ia data .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to estimate the model parameters .",
    "the joint likelihood is given by @xmath53 .",
    "the nuisance parameters such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 are marginalized .",
    "we modify the publicly available cosmological monte carlo sampler ( cosmomc ) @xcite to estimate the background parameters and anisotropic parameters . for @xmath0cdm model",
    ", the isotropic parameter can be well constrained by supernovae data . for @xmath4cdm and cpl models ,",
    "however , the isotropic parameters ca nt be well constrained by using the supernovae data only . following the method in @xcite , therefore , we combine the supernovae data with the planck  2013 results of cmb temperature anisotropy ( planck2013 ) , the wmap9 observations of cmb polarizations ( wp ) , and the sdss - iii boss dr11 baryon acoustic oscillations data ( bao ) to constrain the isotropic parameters .",
    "once the isotropic parameters are given , we can fix them and fit the anisotropic parameters with jla sne ia only .",
    "as was mentioned above , we study the anisotropic signals of the dipole - modulated @xmath0cdm , @xmath4cdm and cpl models by using the jla sample .",
    "the nuisance parameters such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be marginalized , since they are not model parameters with significant meanings .",
    "we just focus on studying the anisotropic signals , thus neglect the topic of model comparison .",
    "our final results are listed in table [ tab : parameters1 ] , where the models and the anisotropic amplitudes and preferred directions are given .",
    "the likelihood distributions of the anisotropic parameters @xmath9 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in three cosmological models are plotted in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] . in the last panel of figure  [ fig : figure1 ]",
    ", we also plot the distribution of @xmath54 .    .the",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the modulated @xmath0cdm model , the isotropic parameter can be well constrained by using the jla dataset only .",
    "the result is @xmath56 @xcite , which is computed for a fixed fiducial value of @xmath57 .",
    "the change of @xmath58 does not affect the best - fit value of @xmath59 . by using the mcmc approach , and fixing @xmath59 at 0.295",
    ", the anisotropic amplitude is constrained as @xmath2 at @xmath3 c.l .",
    ", which is consistent with the isotropy within @xmath55 uncertainty .",
    "this implies that the jla compilation shows no significant evidence for the deviations from isotropy . in the galactic coordinates , the dipole direction points towards f",
    "@xmath60 at @xmath1 c.l .",
    "by contrast , the union2 sample gives constraints on the dark energy dipole as @xmath61 and @xmath62 at @xmath1 c.l .",
    ", which implies that the anisotropic expansion of the universe is permitted at more than @xmath7 @xcite . however , the statistical significance can be highly lowered if the full covariance matrix of sne ia is considered in the union2 compilation @xcite .",

    ": parameters1 ] , we can see that all the three cosmological models give consistent results . at first glimpse ,",
    "the dipole directions we obtained seem to be consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "however , this is in fact not the case . in our calculation , we constrain dipole amplitude to be non - negative , i.e. , @xmath76 , and let the dipole direction runs over the whole sky .",
    "@xcite parameterized the dipole modulation as @xmath77 , which has a sign difference from our parametrization of equation ( [ muth ] ) .",
    "therefore , our dipole direction is actually opposite to that obtained by @xcite .    to test if the discrepancy between our results and previous works is due to the different dataset or different method .",
    "we apply our method to union2 dataset , such that direct comparison with previous results can be made .",

    "we obtain @xmath79 and @xmath80 at @xmath1 c.l .",
    "regardless of the much larger uncertainty , the dipole direction we obtained is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "however , our results show that the union2 dataset is consistent with isotropy at @xmath55 c.l . , and",
    "the @xmath3 upper bound on anisotropy is @xmath81 . on the other hand , if we apply the least - square method , we obtain @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "both the anisotropic amplitude and preferred direction are well consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we probed the possibly anisotropic expansion of the universe by using the recently released jla compilation of sne ia .",
    "we considered the dipole - modulated deviation from the isotropy in three different dark energy models .",
