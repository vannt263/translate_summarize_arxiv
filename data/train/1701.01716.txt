    "that is , if @xmath198 can be expressed as a function only of @xmath8 , the variation for @xmath198 leads to the same result as that for @xmath8 . in the present case , however , @xmath198 is the solution of the differential equation ( [ seifert - de ] ) and depends on the hysteresis of @xmath8 .",
    "then the variation for @xmath198 does not necessarily coincide with that for @xmath8 .",
    "for example , let us consider the modification of the optimized function by adding a term which is given by a function of @xmath199 .",
    "clearly the variation of this term with respect to @xmath198 vanishes and the optimization is not changed . however",
    ", this added term induces another term when the variation with respect to @xmath8 is considered because of the hysteresis of @xmath8 in @xmath198 . in the present optimization problem ,",
    "therefore , we should consider the variation for @xmath8 , not for @xmath198 .",
    "the present approach can be extended to more general potentials .",
    "because it is generally difficult to find the analytic expressions of the corresponding eigenfunctions , we then need to introduce another expansion , where the eigenfunctions of the general potential are expressed in terms of , for example , the eigenfunctions of the harmonic potential .",
    "this procedure is , again , well - known in quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , when we consider the system of the higher spatial dimension , we have degenerated eigenvalues and then the present expansion method should be modified .",
    "these applications are left as future works .    in the present calculation",
    ", we have considered that the control parameter @xmath8 is a smooth deterministic function of time .",
    "however it is more realistic to consider the fluctuation of such a protocol and then we need to optimization of stochastic variables .",
    "the stochastic variation has been discussed in the formulations of the quantum theory and hydrodynamics , but the applicability to the optimization of the irreversible work is still an open problem @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting whether we can apply the similar argument to relativistic @xcite and quantum systems @xcite .",
