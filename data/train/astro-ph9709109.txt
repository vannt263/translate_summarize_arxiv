    "since the discovery of the high - redshift ly@xmath1 forest over 25 years ago , these abundant absorption features in the spectra of qsos have been used as evolutionary probes of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , galactic halos , and now large - scale structure and chemical evolution .",
    "the rapid evolution in the distribution of lines per unit redshift , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) , was consistent with a picture of these features as highly ionized `` clouds '' whose numbers and sizes were controlled by the evolution of the igm pressure , the metagalactic ionizing radiation field , and galaxy formation .",
    "early observations also suggested that ly@xmath1 clouds had characteristic sizes @xmath17 kpc , were much more abundant than ( @xmath18 ) galaxies , and showed little clustering in velocity space .",
    "they were interpreted as pristine , zero - metallicity gas left over from the recombination era .",
    "one therefore expected low - redshift ( @xmath19 ) absorption clouds to show only traces of h  i , due to photoionization and evaporation in a lower pressure igm .",
    "all these ideas have now changed with new data .",
    "one of the delightful spectroscopic surprises from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) was the discovery of ly@xmath1 absorption lines toward the quasar 3c  273 at @xmath20 by both the faint object spectrograph ( fos , ( bahcall et al . 1991 ) and the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs , morris et al .",
    "1991 ) . in this review",
    ", i will describe (  2 ) the current status of our group s long - term program with the hst and vla to define the parameters and nature of the low - redshift ly@xmath1 forest . in ",
    "3 , i discuss related theoretical work on the metagalactic ionizing background , @xmath21 , and the contribution of low-@xmath0 ly@xmath1 clouds to the baryon density , @xmath2 .",
    "the frequency of low-@xmath0 ly@xmath1 lines reported by the hst / fos key project , @xmath22 for lines with @xmath23 m  ( bahcall et al .",
    "1996 ) , was considerably higher than a simple extrapolation from the high - redshift forest .",
    "these higher - n@xmath24 absorbers exhibit associations with galaxies ( @xmath25 kpc ) about half the time ( lanzetta et al . 1995 ) .    in hst cycles 46 , our group began ghrs studies of lower - n@xmath24 absorbers toward 11 bright targets ( stocke et al .",
    "1995 ; shull , stocke , & penton 1996 ) .",
    "these low-@xmath0 targets were chosen because of their well - mapped distributions of foreground galaxies ( superclusters and voids ) .",
    "our studies were designed to measure the distribution of ly@xmath1 absorbers in redshift ( @xmath26 ) and column density ( @xmath27 ) , to probe their association with galaxies , and to measure their clustering and large - scale structure . toward 11 targets",
    ", we detected 73 ly@xmath1 systems over a pathlength @xmath28 km  s@xmath6 . in cycle 7",
    ", we will observe 14 more sightlines with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) to double our ly@xmath1 sample .",
    "the locations of ly@xmath1 absorbers toward two of our first sightlines are shown in figure 1 .    in our first 4 sightlines ,",
    "the frequency of absorbers with n@xmath29 @xmath4 was @xmath30 , corresponding to a local space density , @xmath31 for absorber radius @xmath32 .",
    "this space density is @xmath33 times that of bright ( @xmath18 ) galaxies , but similar to that of dwarf galaxies with @xmath34 . from a statistical , nearest - neighbor analysis",
    ", we found that the ly@xmath1 clouds have some tendency to associate with large structures of galaxies and to `` avoid the voids '' .",
    "however , for the lower column systems , the nearest bright galaxies are often too far to be physically associated in hydrostatic halos or disks ( maloney 1993 ; dove & shull 1994 ) . of 10 absorption systems",
    "first analyzed ( shull et al . 1996 ) , 3 lie in voids , with the nearest bright galaxies several mpc distant . in several cases , we identified dwarf h  i galaxies within 100300 kpc using the vla ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows one system toward mrk  335 , where a dwarf galaxy with @xmath35 and offset distance @xmath36 is seen at heliocentric velocity @xmath37  km  s@xmath6 , remarkably near to that of the ly@xmath1 absorber .",
    "thus , some of the lower - n@xmath24 absorbers appear to be associated with dwarf galaxies , although much better statistics are needed .",
    "in hst / cycle 6 , we observed 7 more sightlines ( penton , shull , & stocke 1998 ) with the ghrs / g160 m . with better data , we were able to detect weaker ly@xmath1 absorption lines , down to 20 m(n@xmath38 @xmath4 ) in some cases .",
    "many of the new sightlines exhibit considerably more ly@xmath1 absorbers ; for these 11 sightlines , @xmath39 for n@xmath3 @xmath4 or one line every 1200 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "although there is wide variation , this frequency is almost 3 times the value ( one every 3400 km  s@xmath6 ) reported earlier ( shull et al .",
    "1996 ) for n@xmath40 @xmath4 . for a curve of growth with @xmath41 km  s@xmath6 , the 61 ly@xmath1 absorbers with @xmath42 follow a distribution @xmath43 .",
    "these results may change somewhat after correcting for incompleteness , line blending , and the ghrs sensitivity function ( penton et al . 1998 ) .",
    "i turn now to the extraordinary sightline toward pks  2155 - 304 ( bruhweiler et al .",
    "this target exhibits 12 ly@xmath1 absorbers ( fig .",
    "3 ) , including a group of strong systems between @xmath44 15,700 and 17,500 km  s@xmath6 . the strong absorbers have an estimated combined column density n@xmath45 @xmath4 , based on lyman - limit absorption seen by orfeus ( appenzeller et al .",
    "1995 ) . using the vla ( van gorkom et al . 1996",
    "; shull et al .",
    "1998a ) , we have identified these absorbers with the very extended halos or intragroup gas associated with four large galaxies at the same redshift ( fig .",
    "the offsets from the sightline to these galaxies are enormous .    despite the kinematic associations",
    ", it would be challenging to make a dynamical association with such galaxies .",
    "one must extrapolate from the @xmath46 @xmath4 columns seen in galactic 21-cm emission to the range @xmath47 @xmath4 probed by ly@xmath1 absorption .",
    "much of the strong ly@xmath1 absorption may arise in gas of wide extent , @xmath48 mpc in diameter , spread throughout the group of galaxies at @xmath49 . assuming @xmath50 @xmath4 and applying corrections for ionization ( h@xmath51/h @xmath52 for @xmath53 and 600 kpc cloud depth ) and for helium mass ( @xmath54 ) , the total gas mass could be @xmath55 .",
    "these absorbers offer an excellent opportunity to set stringent limits on heavy - element abundances and d / h in low - metallicity gas in the far regions of such galaxies .",
    "for example , no si  iii @xmath56 absorption is detected ( @xmath57 m  or n@xmath58 @xmath4 at @xmath59 ) at wavelengths corresponding to the strong ly@xmath1 absorbers at 1281.25   and 1284.75  . over a range of photoionization models for ( h@xmath51/h ) and ( si@xmath60/si )",
    ", this limit corresponds to an abundance ( si / h ) @xmath61 for an assumed n@xmath62 @xmath4 and 300600 kpc cloud depth ( shull et al .",
    "the lack of observed c  iv @xmath63 absorption leads to similar limits .",
    "a rudimentary analysis of the lack of observed d  i ( ly@xmath1 ) absorption in the blueward wings of the strong h  i lines suggests that ( d / h ) @xmath10 .",
    "these limits can be improved with more sophisticated profile fitting and future data from hst / stis and fuse .",
    "the h  i toward pks  2155 - 304 appears to represent gas with the lowest detected metallicity .",
    "was this gas was once inside the galaxies at @xmath64 km  s@xmath6 , or is it pristine ?",
    "we can perhaps answer this question by deeper spectral searches for traces of metals .",
    "the origin of the lower - column ly@xmath1 systems would seem to be more diverse , possibly arising in extended halos or debris disks of dwarf galaxies , large galaxies , and small groups ( morris & van den bergh 1994 ) .",
    "a primary theoretical issue is whether low-@xmath0 clouds have any relation to the evolution of the baryons in the high-@xmath0 forest .",
    "a quick estimate suggests that the low-@xmath0 absorbers could contain a substantial ( 25% ) fraction of the total baryons estimated from big bang nucleosynthesis , @xmath65 ( burles & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "consider those ly@xmath1 systems with n@xmath29 @xmath4 , for which one can derive the space density @xmath66 , @xmath67 the major uncertainty in deriving absorber masses is the ionization correction , which depends on the profile of gas density around the cloud centers .",
    "assume , for simplicity , that @xmath68 , and adopt photoionization equilibrium at rate @xmath69 at 20,000  k. the ionizing radiation field is @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the h  i column density integrated through the cloud at impact parameter @xmath73 is , @xmath74 we can solve for @xmath75 and find the total gas mass within @xmath76 for a fiducial column density n@xmath77 , @xmath78 =          ( 1.6 \\times 10^{9}~m_{\\odot } ) n_{14}^{1/2 }       j_{-23}^{1/2 } b_{100}^{5/2 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] which yields a cloud closure parameter in baryons , @xmath79 note that @xmath2 is insensitive to the scaling parameters : @xmath80^{1/2 }                 \\left [ \\frac { t_e}{20,000~{\\rm k } } \\right ] ^{0.38 }            \\left [ \\frac { 4.8}{\\alpha_s + 3 } \\right ] ^{1/2 }             h_{75}^{-1 }   \\ ; .\\ ] ] for the spherical - cloud model , the radiation field , cloud size , and column - density distribution probably each contribute 3040% to the uncertainty in @xmath2 , while temperature @xmath81 and ionizing spectral index @xmath82 contribute 10% , for an overall uncertainty of 50% .",
    "however , as with the high-@xmath0 forest , the greatest uncertainty in @xmath2 lies in the cloud geometry and radial profile .",
    "these parameters can only be understood by building up statistics through many sightlines , particularly multiple targets that probe the same cloud structures .",
    "we have also increased our understanding of the metagalactic ionizing background radiation and the `` gunn - peterson '' opacities , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . using a new cosmological radiative transfer code and igm opacity model , fardal , giroux , & shull ( 1997 ) model the ionization fractions of h  i and he  ii in a fluctuating radiation field due to quasars and starburst galaxies . in this work ,",
    "we have calculated the metagalactic ionizing radiation field , @xmath21 , using qso and stellar emissivities and including cloud diffuse emission and new ( somewhat lower ) igm opacities derived from _ keck _",
    "ly@xmath1 forest spectra .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the evolution of @xmath85 from @xmath86 , peaking at @xmath87 . at @xmath88 , the absorption breaks at 1 and 4 ryd",
    "become much less prominent and @xmath85 drops rapidly . at low redshift ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath85 depends both on the local ( seyfert ) luminosity function and on the opacity model .",
    "david roberts , mark giroux , and i have recalculated these quantities ( shull et al .",
    "1998b ) using extrapolated euv emissivities of low - redshift seyferts from our iue - agn database ( penton & shull , unpublished ) and a new low-@xmath0 opacity model .",
    "we find @xmath11 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 sr@xmath6 at @xmath90 , very close to our adopted scaling parameter , @xmath91 .",
    "we clearly still have an enormous amount to learn about the nature and distribution of the low - redshift ly@xmath1 clouds .",
    "it seems likely that future studies may uncover valuable information about their connection to large - scale structure and to the processes of galaxy formation and evolution ."
