    "the following sections contain applications of these concepts : time dilatation and the simultaneity of spatially separated events in different inertial frames , the lorentz invariance of spatial intervals , velocity transformation formulae and reciprocity relations , einstein s train - embankment experiment  @xcite and a thought experiment involving two trains moving on parallel tracks at different speeds due to sartori  @xcite .",
    "as explained below , these two thought experiments were incorrectly analysed in previous papers by the present author .",
    "an experiment is considered where a ponderable physical object at some fixed position in an inertial frame , s , is in uniform motion relative to another inertial frame s. the frame s is denoted as the _ base frame _ of the experiment , s as a _",
    "travelling frame_. as is conventional the origin of s moves along the positive @xmath0-axis in s with speed @xmath1 , the @xmath0- and @xmath2-axes being parallel , and the object lying on the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the above configuration describes a _ primary experiment _ ; the value of @xmath1 is a fixed initial condition specified in the frame s. an experiment with a _ reciprocal configuration _ is one in which the origin of s moves along the negative @xmath2-axis with speed @xmath3 .",
    "s is now the base frame and s the travelling frame .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is a fixed initial condition ( in general not equal to @xmath1 ) specified in the frame s. in the special case that @xmath4 , the experiment with the reciprocal configuration is termed _ reciprocal _ to the primary experiment , and _ vice versa_.",
    "the nomenclature introduced above is now applied to a primary experiment and its reciprocal , in which similar clocks c , c are situated at the origins of s and s respectively . in the primary experiment",
    "c moves with speed @xmath5 along the positive @xmath0-axis in s , and in the reciprocal experiment c moves with speed @xmath6 along the negative @xmath2-axis in s. the lorentz transformations ( and their inverses ) describing the experiments are as follows :    transformation : @xmath7 = 0,~\\rightarrow x({\\rm c'})_b = vt({\\rm c})_b   \\\\      t'({\\rm c'})_t & = & \\gamma [ t({\\rm c})_b- \\frac { v x({\\rm c'})_b}{c^2}],~\\rightarrow t'({\\rm c'})_t        = \\frac{t({\\rm c})_b}{\\gamma }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    inverse transformation : @xmath8,~\\rightarrow x({\\rm",

    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the times recorded by c and c respectively and the subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 specify whether the space or time coordinate is defined in a base frame or a travelling frame , respectively . thus @xmath16 and @xmath17 are times recorded by clocks at rest in primary and reciprocal experiments , respectively while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the respective times recorded by clocks in motion in the two experiments.the time dilatation ( td ) relations given by the second equations in ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.4 ) , ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 ) are obtained by using the equations of motion in ( 3.1 ) , ( 3.3 ) , ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.7 ) respectively to eliminate the spatial coordinates on the right sides of the first equations in ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.4 ) , ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 ) .",

    "the lt equations for the reciprocal experiment contain only the spatial cordinates of the travelling clock c , the position of the stationary base frame clock c being arbitary . * in both experiments , clocks in the travelling ( base ) frame appear to be running slower ( faster ) to observers in the base ( travelling ) frames . *",
    "identical predictions are given , in both the primary and reciprocal experiments , by the transformation and the inverse transformation .",
    "* the td relations : @xmath20 are translationally invariant ( do not depend on the spatial positions of the clocks ) .",

    "since , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 it follows from ( 4.12 ) that : @xmath53 the spatial separation of the clocks in s and s is therefore the same for all values of @xmath43 there is no ` relativistic length contraction ' .",
    "how the latter spurious effect correlated with ` relativity of simultaneity '  arises is also discussed in refs .",
    "two , physically distinct , kinds of velocity addition formulae are considered in this section .",
    "the first , corresponding to the well - known relativistic velocity addition formulae as derived by einstein in ref .",
    "@xcite , gives relations between the base frame velocities of a single object in different inertial frames .",
    "the second gives the transformation of the relative velocity of two objects in a given inertial frame into the similarly defined relative velocity between them in another inertial frame .",
    "for the first type of transformation , since only base frame velocities are involved , the ` travelling frame ' concept plays no role , whereas it is essential for the second ( relative velocity ) transformation in order to correctly understand the physical basis of the td effect .",
    "suppose that the frame s moves with speed @xmath5 in the positive @xmath0-direction in s and that an object moves with velocity components @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the directions of the @xmath0- and @xmath56-axes in s. the first type of calculation predicts the corresponding base frame velocities @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the frame s. the bar on a symbol denotes that it is a derived quantity rather than an assumed initial value of a parameter of the problem . the appropriate differential lt formulae are : @xmath59 \\\\          dy'_b & = & dy_b   \\\\         dt'_b & = & \\gamma[dt_b - \\frac{v dx_b}{c^2 } ]         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 dividing ( 5.1 ) or ( 5.2 ) by ( 5.3 ) and subsituting , in the equations so obtained , the base frame velocities defined in ( 5.4 ) and ( 5.5 ) gives the longitudinal and transverse base frame velocity addition formulae : @xmath61 eqs(5.1)-(5.3 ) can also be used to derive transformation equations for the 4-vector velocity , @xmath62 , of the object .",

    "it is interesting to note that , although space - time events in an experiment and its reciprocal are physically independent , the initial kinematical configurations in the two experiments are related by the kinematical lt ( 5.11)-(5.13 ) that yields the parallel velocity addition formula when @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 if @xmath74 ( for example an object at rest at the origin of s ) than ( 5.16 ) gives @xmath75 , which describes the kinematical configuration of the reciprocal experiment the object moves with speed @xmath1 along the negative @xmath2-axis in s.    consider now an experiment in which an object moving with the specified speed @xmath76 along the positive @xmath0-axis in s is observed in the travelling frame s. since the relative velocity of the object and the frame s , in s , is @xmath77 , the speed of the object , as observed in s , is the transformed value of this relative velocity . if the origins of s and s and the moving object all have the same @xmath0-coordinate at time @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , the separation , @xmath80 , in the frame s , of the object from the origin of s at time @xmath81 is @xmath82 if @xmath83 is the velocity of the object in s , in the positive @xmath2 direction , in the primary experiment , the separation of the object from the origin of s at time @xmath84 is @xmath85 the lorentz invariance , ( 4.10 ) , of the spatial separation of the object from the origin of s , at the corresponding times @xmath81 and @xmath84 , which implies , for @xmath79 , @xmath86 , and the td relation : @xmath87 ( c.f .",

    "@xcite , that `` the velocity of an inertial frame of reference s , with respect to another inertial frame of reference s , is equal and opposite to velocity of s relative to s '' , although true in galilean relativity , no longer holds in special relativity , being replaced by the reciprocity relation ( 5.20 ) , when the space - time lt is used to transform events , in a particular space - time experiment , from one frame into another . as derivation of the latter equation shows , the breakdown of the rp is a necessary consequence of the definition of a relative velocity , the invariance of spatial intervals , and td .",
    "the reciprocity relation for an experiment with a reciprocal configuration where s is the base frame and s the travelling frame is @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "eqn(5.21 ) is obtained from ( 5.20 ) by exchange of primed and unprimed quantities .",
    "reciprocal experiments correspond to the special case where @xmath95 .",
    "thus , in special relativity , the rp should be replaced a ` kinematical reciprocity principle ' ( krp )  @xcite : ` the velocity of an inertial frame of reference s ' relative to another such frame s in a space - time experiment is equal and opposite to the velocity of s relative to s in the reciprocal experiment. this statement , which is actually the definition of a reciprocal experiment , rather than a relation between velocities in different frames in the same space - time experiment , is applicable in both special and galilean relativity .",
    "a straightforward application of the relative velocity transformation law ( 5.19 ) is to the analysis of the much - discussed train - embankment thought experiment@xcite .",
    "this was introduced by einstein in the popular book ` relativity , the special and general theory ' with the intention to illustrate , in a simple way , ` relativity of simultaneity ' .",
    "light signals are produced by lightning strikes which simultaneously hit an embankment at positions coincident with the front and back ends of a moving train .",
    "the signals are seen by an observer , o@xmath96 , at the middle of the train and an observer , o@xmath97 , on the embankment , aligned with o@xmath96 at the instant of the lightning strikes .",
    "the light signals are observed simultaneously by o@xmath97 who concludes that the lightning strikes are simultaneous .",
    "because of the relative motion of o@xmath96 and the light signals , the latter are not observed by o@xmath96 at the same time . invoking the constancy of the speed of light in the train frame",
    ", einstein concludes that o@xmath96 would not judge the strikes to be simultaneous , giving rise to a ` relativity of simultaneity ' effect between the train and embankment frames .",
    "this train - embankment thought experiment ( tete ) is now analysed in terms of the concepts and nomenclature introduced above .",
    "the observer o@xmath96 is replaced by a two - sided light detector , d , at the middle of the train .",
    "the latter moves to the right with speed @xmath35 .",

    "the velocity transformation formula ( 5.19 ) implies that the speed in s of the right - moving light signal relative to d is @xmath103 while that of the left - moving light signal is @xmath104 .",
    "the pattern of detection events in s and s is then the same , the only difference being that that the velocities of the light signals relative to d are greater in s by the factor @xmath105 a necessary consequence of time dilatation and the invariance of length intervals .",
    "the left - moving light signal is then observed in s at the time : @xmath106 and the right - moving one at the time : @xmath107 the time dilatation effect for the travelling frame s is manifest in these equations .",
    "it is seen to be a consequence of the relative velocity transformation formula ( 5.19 ) , not of lc .    on the assumption that an experimenter analysing the signals received by d knows the essential parameters of the problem , @xmath100 , @xmath35 , and @xmath99 , the measured times @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the train frame can be used to decide whether the left and right moving light signals were emitted simultaneously in this frame or not . if the right - moving and left - moving signals are emitted at times @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively then ( 6.1 ) and ( 6.2 ) are modified to : @xmath112 and @xmath113 subtracting ( 6.3 ) from ( 6.4 ) and rearranging : @xmath114 the observed time difference @xmath115 and knowledge of the value of @xmath116 then enables determination of @xmath117 so that the simultaneity of emission of the light signals can be tested . for the event configurations shown in fig . 1 it would be indeed concluded that @xmath118 , so the emission of the signals is found to be simultaneous in the train frame , contrary to einstein s assertion in ref .",
    "@xcite . the essential flaw in einstein s argument was the failure to distinguish between the speed of light , relative to some fixed object in an inertial frame , and the speed of light relative to some moving object in the same frame , which is what is relevant for the analysis of the tete .",
    "einstein s interpretation corresponds to replacing @xmath109 and @xmath108 by @xmath119 and @xmath120 , so that only events in the embankment frame are considered , and making the replacements , ( confusing the speed of light in an inertial frame , with the relative speed of light and a moving object in the same frame ) : @xmath121 in ( 6.1 ) and ( 6.2 ) giving : @xmath122 this leads to einstein s false conclusion that the light signal emission events would be found to be non - simultaneous in the train frame .",
    "an analysis of the tete in a previous paper  @xcite by the present author also concluded that the train observer would judge the lightning strikes to be simulataneous , but the reasoning leading to this conclusion was fallacious . at the time of writing ref .",
    "@xcite i had not understood correctly the distinction between an experiment and its reciprocal and the difference in physical interpretation of a space - time and a kinematial lt explained in sections 3 and 5 above .",
    "i incorrectly assumed that the kinematical lt relating two base frame velocities was valid in a single space - time experiment , that is , for transformation between a base frame and a travelling frame .",

    "1 of the present paper were assumed to be @xmath99 .",

    "it is clear that , for example , the times @xmath137 and @xmath140 must both be times of clocks at rest in s but observed in motion from s in the primary experiment shown in figs 1 - 3 , @xmath145 $ ] , and times of clocks at rest in s and observed in the same frame for the reciprocal experiment @xmath144 $ ] .    the argument given by sartori for ( 7.6 ) and ( 7.7 ) is that , for ( 7.6 ) ` the events 1 and 2 occur at the same position in s ' so that @xmath136 is a proper time interval , and for ( 7.7 ) that ` the events 1 and 3 occur at the same position in s ' so that @xmath140 is a proper time interval. actually all the times in the td relations shown in ( 7.1)-(7.3 ) are ` proper time intervals ' recorded by some clock . given the existence of an array of synchonised clocks in each frame , it is of no importance , for the timing of two events whether , or not , their times are both measured locally by the same clock .",
    "suppose that in fig .",
    "3 there is a clock c at rest in s , synchronised with a clock at t1 , distant l2 from it , such that event 2 in fig .",
    "3b is local at c. because c and a synchronised clock at t1 both record @xmath156 at the epoch of event 1 , the time interval in s , between events 1 and 2 in s , is correctly given by the epoch @xmath137 , as measured by c , of the event 2 which is local at c. since @xmath137 is a`proper time interval ' measured by the clock c , then if @xmath157 as in ( 7.6 ) , as measured by a local clock at t1 , then also @xmath158 as measured by the local clock c , in contradiction with sartori s assumption ( 7.6 ) .",
    "summarising , sartori s analysis assumes incorrectly that the base frames of an experiment and its reciprocal are related by the space - time lt and uses td relations in an inconsistent manner , ( 7.7 ) being applicable to the primary experiment shown in figs 2 - 4 : @xmath145 $ ] , and ( 7.6 ) to the reciprocal experiment : @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "that the algebraic manipulation of ( 7.4)-(7.7 ) yields the correct velocity addition formula ( 5.16 ) must then be considered as purely fortuitous .    in my previous analysis",
    "@xcite of sartori s thought experiment , the same mistake of principle was made as in that of the train / embankment experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite . in common with sartori",
    ", it was assumed that the the kinematical configurations of a primary experiment and its reciprocal correspond to the base and travelling frame configurations of the primary experiment . that is ( see figs . 1 and 2 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) that the velocities in the frame s in the experiment shown in figs . 2 - 4 and the first row of table 1 of the present paper , were given instead by the base frame velocities in s of the reciprocal experiment shown in the second row of table 1 .",
    "thus , it is falsely assumed that the base frame configurations of an experiment and its reciprocal are actually the base and travelling frame configurations of the primary experiment , and that events in these two frames are connected by the space - time lt .",
    "this leads to false predictions  @xcite of the breakdown of the lorentz invariance of spatial intervals in different inertial frames and ratios between time intervals observed in different inertial frames differing from the td effect .",
