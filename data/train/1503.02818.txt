    "helfrich hamiltonian provides successful framework for describing many features of bilayer membranes and vesicles , including their large - scale shapes and transformations between them @xcite , membrane - membrane interactions @xcite , and membrane - mediated forces between proteins ( `` inclusions '' ) @xcite . in light of this success and the wide acceptance off the model within the soft matter and biophysics communities ,",
    "it is surprising how poorly understood and confusing remains the surface tension term @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) .",
    "below we briefly review some of the complications associated with the concept of membrane surface tension .",
    "membranes are much more flexible to bending than stretching .",
    "therefore , in theoretical studies it is sometimes assumed that the lipids area density is fixed @xcite , and changes in the total area result in from changes in the number of lipids @xcite . in this picture , the surface tension is essentially the chemical potential of the surface lipids @xcite .",
    "lipids , however , are highly insoluble in water ( their critical micelle concentration is typically in the @xmath14 m range @xcite ) , which makes the above interpretation for the surface tension largely irrelevant as there is almost no exchange of lipids between the bilayer membrane and the embedding aqueous medium . more commonly , the surface tension is considered as a measure for the elastic response of a membrane with a fixed number of lipids to area variations @xcite .",
    "this view clearly differs from the meaning of the term `` surface tension '' for fluid / fluid interfaces , where it serves as a measure for the free energy penalty resulting from an exchange of molecules between the `` bulk '' phases and the `` interface '' @xcite .",
    "further complication arises from the fact that the membrane is a ( quasi ) two dimension manifold embedded in a three dimensional space .",
    "therefore , it has two characteristic areas - ( i ) the total physical area @xmath11 , and ( ii ) the area of its projection onto a planar reference frame , @xmath15 .",
    "helfrich hamiltonian involves an integral over the total area @xmath11 ; but this area ( whose determination , taking into account the molecular structure of the membrane , is not without ambiguity ) can not be fixed due to the membrane thermal undulations .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is not a valid thermodynamic variable @xcite .",
    "it is , in fact , the projected area @xmath15 that emerges as the computationally relevant quantity @xcite .",
    "the force per unit length that needs to imposed on the frame in order to fix its area to @xmath15 is known as the _ mechanical ( frame ) _ tension , and will be denoted henceforth by @xmath1 .",
    "theoretically , the mechanical tension can be identified with the derivative of the elastic free energy , @xmath16 , with respect to @xmath15 : @xmath17 ( where the differentiation is carried while holding the volume of the system , as well as the temperature and number of lipids , fixed ) .",
    "one can also fix @xmath1 and let @xmath15 fluctuate . in this case , the relevant free energy is @xmath18 , and the mean projected area satisfies @xmath19",
    "another confusing aspect associated with the concept of surface tension is the distinction between helfrich hamiltonian and the membrane free energy @xmath16 .",
    "the latter is often referred to as the _ helfrich free energy _ , and the confusion arises because it is assumed to have the same form as the helfrich hamiltonian @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : helffreee ] ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote , respectively , the area and total curvature of the _ mean profile _ of the membrane .",

    "( [ eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the statistical mechanics of thermal fluctuations around the mean profile are accounted for in the values of the renormalized elastic coefficients . for a membrane with a mean flat profile ( i.e. ,",
    "not subjected to normal bending forces ) @xmath25 and , @xmath26 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : helffreee ] ) takes the form @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "another quantity that can be identified as the membrane surface tension is the , so called , _",
    "@xmath29_-coefficient @xmath0 , also known as the _ fluctuation _ tension .",
    "the fluctuation tension is measured from the fourier spectrum of the membrane height function with respect to the plane of the frame . for a membrane with a mean flat profile ,",
    "the thermal average of the amplitude of a fourier mode with wavevector @xmath30 satisfies : @xmath31 , and @xmath32 } , \\label{eq : flucspect1}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is boltzmann constant , @xmath34 is the temperature , and @xmath35 is a microscopic cutoff length .",
    "some controversy surrounded eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucspect1 ] ) concerning the question whether @xmath0 , the @xmath29-coefficient in the denominator on the right hand side , is equal to @xmath6 or @xmath23 . this issue has been recently settled , and it now understood that the correct coefficient is the renormalized surface tension @xmath23 @xcite , or , according to some theoretical studies , a slightly modified version of this surface tension , @xmath36 @xcite . similarly , the @xmath37 coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucspect1 ] ) is equal to the renormalized bending modulus @xmath24 . combining this with the discussion about eq .",
    "( [ eq : helffreee ] ) , we conclude that both the measurable fluctuation and mechanical tensions coincide with each other ( and with the renormalized tension @xmath23 ) : @xmath38 .",
    "when the surface tension @xmath39 vanishes , the membrane is `` free to choose '' the equilibrium projected area @xmath15 that minimizes the free energy @xmath40 .",
    "the question we now wish to address concerns with the elastic response of the membrane to a further decrease in the frame area , which involves the application of a negative surface tension . based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucspect1 ] ) , one may argue that for @xmath41 , the membrane always becomes mechanically unstable because the amplitude of any mode with @xmath42 diverges .",
    "but such modes exist only in sufficiently large membranes , hence , small membranes can always sustain some negative surface tension .",
    "for instance , consider a square membrane of linear size @xmath43 with @xmath44 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucspect1 ] ) , one finds that such a membrane can withstand negative surface tension of size @xmath45 ( which is comparable in magnitude to the typical positive rupture tension ) , provided that @xmath46 .",
    "this is the characteristic size of real small liposomes , and of bilayers in highly coarse - grained simulations .",
    "thus , the above estimation highlights the fact that the question of elastic response to negative surface tension is both interesting and relevant to current experimental and computational studies .    the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucspect1 ] ) , and the proof that the fluctuation and mechanical tensions coincide with each other , involves several assumptions that do not necessarily remain valid when @xmath23 becomes negative . specifically , it is based on the investigation of the linear response of a mechanically _ stable _ flat membrane to small normal forces , and is restricted to configurations with smooth ( twice differentiable ) height functions @xmath47 .",
    "but when @xmath48 , the membrane can relieve the free energy cost of compression by buckling .",
    "we note that _ in the absence of normal forces _ ( which is the case under consideration here ) , the system is not expected to undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking similar to that occurring e.g. , in ising spin systems below the critical point .",
    "the reason is that the membrane height profile @xmath47 is a continuous field and , therefore , the transition between different buckled configurations ( e.g. , from buckled `` upward '' to `` downward '' ) does not require the crossing of a free energy barrier . thus , the system remains ergodic for negative tension , and due to the symmetry of the bilayer @xmath31 for all the fourier modes .",
    "the questions that remain are :    \\1 .",
    "does eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucspect1 ] ) still hold for @xmath48 ?",
    "we certainly do not expect it to remain valid for strongly compressed membranes since it is derived from a quadratic ( in the height function ) approximation to the full helfrich hamiltonian ( [ eq : helfhamiltonian2 ] ) .",
    "however , considering the fact that it holds for @xmath49 , there is no apparent reason why it should not hold for small negative @xmath23 .",
    "are the mechanical and fluctuation tensions still equal to each other ?",
    "( obviously , this question is relevant only if the answer to question no .",
    "1 is `` yes '' . )",
    "as noted above , the proof of this equality depends on the surface tension being positive",
    ". now that it is negative , the membrane prefers more buckled configurations with larger mean squared amplitudes .",
    "does this imply that the fluctuation tension @xmath0 drops faster ( i.e. , becomes more negative ) than the mechanical tension @xmath1 ?",
    "\\3 . what happens to the bending modulus @xmath24 under compression ? recall that the coefficient appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flucspect1 ] ) is the renormalized bending modulus which , just like the tension @xmath0 , may vary with the frame area @xmath15 . for positive tensions , the variations in @xmath24 are usually negligible , but this may not be the case for negative tensions when the membrane becomes increasingly more buckled .",
    "does the increase in the degree of buckling under larger compressive stresses involve a decrease in @xmath24 ?",
    "\\4 . does the membrane exhibit linear ( hookean ) elastic response to negative mechanical tension ? in response to a positive tension , the membrane becomes stretched , and the relationship between the change in the area ( strain ) and the stress is indeed linear .",
    "however , the lipids constitute a dense two - dimensional fluid and , therefore , the membrane can be barely compressed below its most favorable physical area @xmath50 .",
    "when , under the application of a negative tension , the physical area @xmath11 reaches @xmath50 , the negative tension causes the membrane to buckle and more and more area is `` stored '' in the out - of - plane fluctuations .",
    "this could lead to a highly non - linear elastic response .",
    "in what follows we will use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to address the above questions .",
    "to allow for large scale membrane simulations ( @xmath51 lipids per monolayer ) in a computationally feasible manner , we employ the cooke - deserno model @xcite , with model parameters used in our recent work on fluid charged membranes @xcite . in this highly coarse - grained model ,",
    "the lipids are represented as trimers with one hydrophilic and two hydrophobic beads , and the embedding solvent is handled implicitly via effective interactions between the hydrophobic beads .",
    "the membranes are simulated in a box of linear size @xmath52 , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath53 ( frame ) plane .",
    "initially , we place a pre - assembled flat membrane at the center of the simulation box , and we then allow it to equilibrate for @xmath54 mc time units .",

    "the membrane is simulated at constant frame tension @xmath1 , which is accomplished by incorporating several move attempts , per time unit , to change the frame area of the membrane @xcite .",
    "each time unit also includes several collective `` mode excitation '' moves @xcite that accelerate the slow dynamics of the long - wavelength fourier modes . for each value of @xmath1",
    ", the initial thermalization period is followed by a period of @xmath56 mc time units during which we sample quantities of interest at 200 mc units intervals .    in what follows ,",
    "we set the thermal energy @xmath57 to be the elementary energy unit , and the length parameter of the deserno - cooke repulsive potential @xmath58 to be the length unit .",
    "we simulate the membrane under frame tensions satisfying @xmath59 ( in @xmath60 units ) which , as revealed by our computational observations , is the stability range of the simulated membranes .",
