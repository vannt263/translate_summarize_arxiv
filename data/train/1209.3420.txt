    "the study of massive stars ( @xmath11 8 m@xmath10 ) is one of the most prolific areas of research in present day astronomy , a fact which can be attributed to the not - so - well understood processes and a range of theories ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "massive star formation , though a rare event in itself , can have a significant impact on its natal environment through processes such as strong stellar wind and supernovae explosions , which transfer large energy and momentum to the surrounding environment .",
    "features such as bright - rimmed clouds and h  ii regions ( owing to their large output of uv photons ) are hallmarks of massive stars in a region .",
    "sh2 - 297 @xcite is an optically visible ( see figure [ fig_region ] ) , classical galactic h  ii region ( @xmath12 @xmath4 07@xmath1305@xmath1413@xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath4 -12@xmath1719@xmath600@xmath18 ) , ionized by a massive star , and bounded by a cold , dark cloud to the west .",
    "it is associated with the reflection nebula and is a part of canis major ( cma ) ob1 association . in the literature , the distance estimates for from 1 to 1.4 kpc @xcite . in the present study , we have adopted the value of 1.1 kpc from @xcite . @xcite established the boundaries of as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "a host of features populate the association - more than 30 nebulae @xcite , the association containing a group of stars ( including ) embedded in a prominent reflection nebula @xcite , and the three interconnected h  ii regions of sh2 - 292 , sh2 - 296 , and ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite , based on the h  i morphology @xcite , emission nebulosity , and the distribution & properties of high - mass ob sources in the region , postulated that a supernova remnant ( snr ) could have induced star formation in .",
    "they estimated the age of the supernova shell to be about half a million years .",
    "the snr hypothesis was supported by the work of @xcite - who estimated a similar age for most of the stellar sources in using optical and infrared studies ; and that of @xcite , whose linear polarization survey of is consistent with the model of supernova induced compression of an initially uniform magnetic field , though , it must be noted that stellar winds too can produce a shell like structure .",
    "however , an alternate star formation hypothesis by @xcite - based on the study of gas velocities and the fact that uv fluxes from two hot stars ( hd 54662 and hd 53975 ) can account for the physical parameters of the shell - suggests that strong stellar winds or evolving h  ii regions are the cause of star formation in the region .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have suggested the same .",
    "@xcite have investigated this region using two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) data and concluded that it presents similar structural properties as typical young and low mass open clusters .",
    "@xcite found a deeply embedded , very young source of intermediate mass , named as uyso1 ( unidentified young stellar object 1 ) , that is driving a high - velocity bipolar co outflow at the interface of the h  ii region and the dark cloud .",
    "it was further resolved into two protostars , uyso1a and uyso1b @xcite .",
    "a recent herschel pacs and spire mapping of the region around these sources has identified five cool and compact far infrared ( fir ) sources , of masses of the order of a few m@xmath10 , hidden in the neighbouring dark cloud @xcite .",
    "continuing with our multiwavelength investigations of massive star - forming regions @xcite , in this paper , we explore the local star formation process around region .",
    "the presence of multiple facets ( like the ionizing star s radiation field , the nebulosity present in the region , and the dark cloud to the west ) necessitates a multiwavelength study to decipher the star formation scenario .",
    "hence , we carried out a detailed study of this region in optical , deep nir , mid infrared ( mir ) , and radio wavelengths to learn about the central ionizing source and its effect on the region , the physical characteristics of the region , the spatial distribution of the ysos and the nature of some selected individual ysos . based on the study of stellar population , their evolutionary status , and the morphology of the region ,",

    "the model gives the expressions for the time when the fragmentation starts ( t@xmath131 ) , and the radius at the time of fragmentation ( r@xmath131 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath132 ( isothermal sound speed in the shocked layer ) , which varies from 0.2 to 0.6 km s@xmath25 , was taken to be 0.2 km s@xmath25 for our calculations . using the values of @xmath72 and @xmath77",

    "this would suggest that fragmentation would start at a radius of 1.70 pc , whereas the stellar sources found are within a 1.70 pc radius of the massive star .",
    "however , the distance of the ysos is the projected distance and the actual distance could be larger . taking the present mean age of the ysos as @xmath4 1 myr and the fragmentation time as calculated",
    ", it would imply that the age difference between the ysos and ( @xmath4 5 @xmath35 3 myr ) is @xmath135 2 myr .",
    "though this @xmath133 calculation suggests that this h  ii region could be old enough to lead to star formation by collect - and - collapse process , the morphology of the region makes this process unlikely .",
    "moreover , we have assumed the lowest value of isothermal sound speed for our calculations ( 0.2 km s@xmath25 ) . a higher value of @xmath132 will only further increase the fragmentation time and radius and make a collect - and - collapse scenario unlikelier .",
    "also , the ysos are not exclusively associated with the pah emission that we see around this region ( figure [ fig_co3to2 ] ) .",
    "pah regions represent the compressed neutral matter between the ionization and shock fronts .",
    "the ysos extend well beyond the pah emission , as is evident from our msx 8.28 @xmath49 m contours ( which , in addition , contains continuum emission too ) .",
    "this is distinctly separate from the star forming regions of , for example , @xcite where young sources and condensations have been observed along the pah ring .",
    "it should be noted that , in an ideal case , one would expect regularly - spaced - clumps / protostars of very similar ages distributed along the periphery of the h  ii region , mostly along the material swept - up by the expanding ionization front .",
    "this is definitely not the case here .",
    "it therefore appears that the collect - and - collapse process due to the star hd 53623 is most likely not involved in the star formation in this region .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the star formation observed at the north - western border of sh2 - 297 is probably due to some other processes .",
    "the formation of ysos in the dark cloud area could partly be due to the influence of expanding h  ii region sh2 - 297 by rdi ( radiation driven implosion ) mechanism ( most likely upto the edge and its vicinity ) @xcite , and partly due to supernova induced star formation as discussed by @xcite ( the distant ysos possibly having formed by this process ) .",
    "the ysos are distributed along the concave arc ( see section [ subsection_spatial_distribution ] ) of the molecular cloud traced by @xmath90co , and seem to have an age sequence .",
    "it appears that the supernova might have swept the molecular material and led to its piling up along the arc .",
    "therefore , as the material might have collected along the arc , beginning from the edge of sh2 - 297 towards the north - west , star formation could have occured at different epochs .",
    "the plausible location of the supernova ( @xmath136 @xmath4 07@xmath1308@xmath14 , @xmath137 @xmath4 -11.2@xmath17 , * ? ? ? * ) and the derived age of the supernova remnant - 0.5 myr @xcite - lend weight to this hypothesis .    to better understand the star formation and the effect of the massive star on the region , we need much deeper , wider and longer wavelength observations for better statistics ( so as to constrain mass and luminosity functions of the embedded ysos ) , and to carry out a study of ysos along the arc of molecular material connecting to the larger region",
    ". it would also be helpful to carry out a radial velocity study and spectroscopic observations for a wider area to constrain the membership , age and spectral type of the ysos .",

    "the star formation seems to have propagated from the ionizing source towards the cloud , which is further supported by the presence of massive protostar uyso1 discovered by @xcite , and cool , compact sources discovered by @xcite , which are located away from the ionizing source .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a very thorough and critical reading of our manuscript .",
    "the useful comments and suggestions made by the referee greatly improved the scientific content of the paper .",
    "the authors thank the staff of hct , operated by indian institute of astrophysics ( bangalore ) ; igo at girawali , operated by inter university centre for astronomy & astrophysics ( iucaa ) , pune ; irsf at south africa in joint partnership between s.a.a.o and nagoya university of japan ; and gmrt managed by national center for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research ( tifr ) for their assistance and support during observations .",
