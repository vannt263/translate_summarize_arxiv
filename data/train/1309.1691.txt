    "for example , the type  1.8 agn ngc  1365 ( z  =  0.00547 ) , also known as the great barred spiral galaxy , is an intriguing source displaying the most dramatic x - ray spectral changes observed so far in an agn : the source switched from reflection - dominated ( compton - thick ) to transmission - dominated ( compton - thin ) and back in just a few days to week time - scales ( risaliti et al .",
    "ngc  1365 can be classified as one of the most extreme examples of  changing look  agn .",
    "this has been attributed to variation in the line - of - sight of cold absorber rather than to extreme intrinsic emission variability .",
    "such rapid time - scales of these x - ray eclipses suggest that these absorbers ( n@xmath0 10@xmath1  10@xmath2@xmath3 ) are located on compact scales consistent within the inner blr and the outer part of the accretion disc .",

    "complex absorption due to clouds of absorbing gas , partially covering the central agn source , is responsible for both the flux variability and the apparent broadening of the fe line ( inoue & matsumoto 2003 , miller , turner & reeves 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "continuum radiation transmitted and scattered through circumnuclear medium carves out the extended red wing , which leads to systematically lower measurements of the smbh spin than obtained by the relativistic reflection method .",

    "however , this can alternatively be explained by an increase of the column density of the cold absorber from 2008 to 2010 that would reduce the red wind of the line as pinpointed by brenneman et al .",

    "2013 ) puts forward a scenario in which the fe  k@xmath4 emission line originates from a cold accretion disc surrounding a smbh of mass @xmath5  m@xmath6 , associated with a dimensionless spin parameter @xmath7 ( extreme kerr bh ) .",
    "their model assumes that the x - ray source , illuminating the accretion disc , is localised on the rotation axis , at 2.5  gravitational radii above the black hole .",

    "the local , polarised reflection spectra are then combined with the _ ky_-code ( doviak et al .",

    ". an `` absolute orientation '' of the polarisation plane is difficult to measure , and we thus focus on the variation of @xmath12 with photon energy .    considering an inclination of @xmath13 = 60@xmath14 for ngc  1365 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2013 ) , the reflection model is found to produce relatively high degrees of polarisation ( p  @xmath15  1  % ) in the 3  100  kev band , with a maximum @xmath11 in the compton hump , where multiple scattering dominates .",
    "below 10  kev , @xmath11 decreases sharply , unlike an energy - independent newtonian case , as the local disc polarisation is affected by the relativistic energy shift of the photons and impacts the resulting polarisation seen by a distant observer ( doviak et al .",
    "the energy - dependence of @xmath11 in the soft x - ray band is accentuated by a dilution mechanism caused by the source , set to favour the production of soft x - ray photons : even if strong gravity effects tend to bend photons back to the disc , a fraction of the input , unpolarised radiation merges with the ( reprocessed ) polarised photons and dilutes the @xmath11 signal .",
    "thus , the minimum polarisation degree produced by disc reflection is @xmath16  % above 1  kev , @xmath17  % between 3 and 10  kev , and up to 10  % in the compton hump regime .",
    "interestingly ( fig .",
    "[ results ] , bottom , red dashed line ) , the relativistic reflection scenario exhibits an energy - dependent @xmath12 that varies significantly across the fe k@xmath4 line , a behaviour already expected from x - ray polarisation simulations in the type-1 agn mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( marin et al .",
    "the feature is related to the energy - dependent albedo and scattering phase function of the disc material .",
    "@xmath12 presents a smooth and continuous variation by @xmath18 around the iron line and increases monotonically upward 20  kev .",
    "taking into account that the changing nature of ngc  1365 is explained by the presence of a clumpy distribution of gas around the central engine , we now investigate the resulting polarisation signal arising from an absorption - dominated model .",
    "we rely on the parametrisation of miller & turner ( 2013 ) to produce a clumpy environment favourable to x - ray eclipses .",

    "( 2013 ) , reproducing both the flux variability and the apparent broadening of the fe line .",
    "we rather examine the polarisation induced by a cloudlet distribution that is supposed to be competitive with its relativistic counterpart .    using the latest version of stokes (",
    "goosmann & gaskell 2007 ; marin et al .",
    "2012b ) , we computed the resulting polarisation of a cloud distribution such as the ones presented in karas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and miller & turner ( 2013 ) .",
    "the model set - up is summarised in fig .  [ models ] ( right - hand panel ) .",
    "the central , x - ray source is defined as a geometrically thin , emitting slab that may represent the so - called hot inner flow .",
    "the emitting region is insensitive to scattering and does not reach down to the isco in order to avoid a possible confusion with relativistic disc reflection . inside a spherical shell constrained between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( in units of spheres radius ) from the model s origin ,",
    "a random distribution of 1 000 scale - independent , compton - thick , absorbing spheres with equal radius and constant density , was generated .",
    "the covering factor of the cloud distribution varies systematically from the poles towards the equator , as suggested by the unified scheme of agn , and is @xmath21 for @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for @xmath24 ( antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the column density of the absorbing , cold medium in a single cloud is equal to 1.5@xmath25  @xmath3 , a value chosen by to maximise the observed hard excess . for coherency , we restrain ourselves to the same input power - law spectrum as in sect .  [",
    "sec : reflect ] .",
    "this parametrisation is in perfect agreement with the modelling of miller & turner ( 2013 ) , allowing us , in the mean time , to examine the net polarisation of `` changing look '' agn and explore the polarimetric signatures of their theoretical , absorption - dominated model .",
    "we find that , in the case of an absorption - dominated model ( fig .  [ results ] , top ) , the resulting polarisation degree is energy - dependent ( solid black line ) , with a maximum @xmath11 observed in the compton hump ( @xmath26 0.5  % ) .",
    "close to 15  kev , the local polarisation strongly diminishes due to a flip of the photon position angle , as perpendicular and parallel photon s position angles cancel each other ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "finally , @xmath11 gradually decreases below the iron fluorescence line energy , as the dilution trend is strengthened by the absence of strong gravity effects bending photons back to the disc .",
    "as forward scattering dominates , we naturally find that the polarisation produced by a clumpy distribution of cold matter is about 15 times weaker than the relativistic model .",
    "the most interesting results come from the variation of the polarisation position angle ( fig .",
    "[ results ] , bottom ) .",
    "the cloud distribution examined in this letter ( solid black line ) shows an instantaneous @xmath12 transition by 90@xmath14 from the soft ( below 15  kev ) to the hard x - ray band , associated with a local diminution of @xmath11 . in the 1  15  kev band , radiation is not energetic enough to scatter through the highly covered equatorial plane and becomes absorbed .",
    "photons escaping from the system scatter on polar clouds , with their normal to the scattering plane perpendicular to the axis of the system , resulting in a polarisation position angle @xmath27 = 0@xmath14 ( marin & goosmann 2011 ; marin et al .",
    "above 15  kev , the compton scattering phase function favours scattering towards the forward direction and , at the same time , the albedo is strong so that photons escape along the observer s viewing angle without suffering from heavy absorption .",
    "the planes of each scattering are predominantly parallel to the equatorial plane of the system , aligning their normal to the projected axis of the system .",
    "thus , the polarisation vectors of the hard x - rays are orthogonal from those of soft x - rays , on average , and the net polarisation position angle @xmath27 is equal to 90@xmath14 ( see fig .  [ scattering ] ) . the competition between scattering in polar and scattering in equatorial clouds , leading to parallel or perpendicular polarisation angle , is energy - dependent and results in an orthogonal switch specific to the prescription . the energy of the @xmath27 rotation is a complex function of opacity and covering fraction , and will be different for other parametrisations .",
    "we showed , in a previous publication centred around mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( marin et al .",
    "2012b ) , that a small pathfinder mission could be able to distinguish between relativistic reflection and transmission through absorbing media .",
    "but , is this still true for ngc  1365 , a rather different object with a much higher ( 60@xmath14 ) inclination , a variable behaviour of its iron line red - wing , and extreme compton - thick to compton - thin regime transitions ? taking into account an average flux in the x - ray band ( @xmath28 1.0  mcrab in the 2  10  kev band , brenneman et al .",

    " 35  kev ) , for a total coverage of 2  35  kev . * the l - class international x - ray observatory _ ixo _ ( barcons et al .",

    "2006 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ predictions ] , we calculated the representative minimum detectable polarisation ( mdp , whose formula can be found in marin et al .",
    "2012a ) on the whole energy range of the instrument at 99  % confidence level that the mission concepts would have reached pointing at ngc  1365 .",
    "the observation time is estimated to 1  ms , taking into account that the background flux is negligible with respect to the source flux .",
    "we assumed a crab - like spectrum , that is a power law with an index of 2.05 and fluxes reported above .",
    "the rate of the source is calculated on a fine energy grid ( 0.1  kev ) by multiplying the telescope collecting area , the detector efficiency and the source spectrum .",
    "then , we multiply ( for each energy ) the square root of the rate by the modulation factor , adding the background ( which is negligible by orders of magnitude in this case ) and smearing the product for the energy resolution of the instrument . eventually , we sum up the values of the product in the energy range of interest to derive the mdp for the selected interval .",
    "the mdp evaluated over representative energy bands are : @xmath28  7  % ( 4  10  kev ) for _ xipe _ , @xmath28  3  % for _ mep / nhxm _ ( 6  35  kev ) and @xmath28  0.3  % for _ ixo _ ( 2  10  kev ) .",
    "we find that the predicted polarisation signal induced by relativistic reflection is below the polarisation detectability of _ xipe _ ( maroon line ) so , for an exposure time of 1  ms , a small , pathfinder mission such as _ xipe _ could not measure the polarisation unless the observed polarisation is significantly ( a factor of 2 ) higher than that predicted by the model .",
    "however , any detection would strongly support the relativistic model that produces a conservative polarisation degree ( see sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "further indications could be deduced from the variation of the polarisation position angle around the iron line if the observed polarisation signal is significant enough .",
    "the blue line , representing the mdp of _ mep / nhxm _ , indicates that the polarisation signal originating from the relativistic reflection case can be detected across the whole 6  35  kev band .",
    "it covers in particular the iron line domain , where the @xmath12 signature of strong gravity would be detected .",
    "finally , for longer observing time or higher flux levels , _ ixo _ ( green line ) would have been the only mission to potentially detect the low polarisation originating from a `` changing look '' agn in the complex absorption scenario .",
    "due to its transient nature , the distribution of gas clouds around the central region of ngc  1365 may vary , both in its covering factor and column density .",
    "lowering the covering factor would result in a decrement of the net polarisation as dilution from the unscattered input spectrum would be enhanced .",
    "a different density parametrisation would also affect the polarisation degree : optically thinner reprocessing clouds would reduce the probabilities of scattering , thus decreasing @xmath11 , while increasing the gas density would slightly increase the polarised flux until the circumnuclear matter becomes optically too thick for the radiation to escape .",
    "nonetheless , since absorption - dominated models are based upon continuum transmission through gas , the overall polarisation degree is expected to be weaker than for ( perpendicular ) scattering off an accretion disc .",
    "one must note that the energy at which the @xmath27 rotation occurs is also governed by the gas density , covering factor , and possibly inclination .",
    "we intend to investigate different realisations of a variety of `` changing look '' agn in future work in order to explore the complex inter - combination of parameters that may lead to similar @xmath27 rotation .",
    "this feature , if observable , could be used as a major constraint to probe the parameter space of the cold gas .    the relativistic reflection model employed to simulate the polarisation response of ngc  1365 is basic , yet instructive . in a forthcoming publication",
    ", we intend to improve our relativistic models by taking into account radially structured surface ionisation and intrinsically polarised , non - axisymmetric irradiation . both implementations are expected to increase the net polarisation , similarly to coronal emission that scatters off an ionised disc and disc return radiation over the potential well ( schnittman & krolik 2010 ; 2013 ) .",
    "therefore , the modelling presented in this letter produces a conservative , lower limit on the polarisation degree .",
    "the polarisation position angle across the iron line turns out to be a particularly strong indicator for the correct scenario  if it can be constrained with a sufficiently powerful x - ray polarimetry mission and/or long enough observations .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ results ] shows that in the case of relativistic reflection @xmath12 follows a characteristic `` s - shape '' between 2 and 9  kev , whereas in the absorption scenario the distribution of @xmath12 is only bipolar .",
    "the detection of a few degrees swing could be within the reach of a large mission , for which the mdp is significantly lower than the expected degree of polarisation .",
    "the fact that in the absorption case only `` parallel '' or `` perpendicular '' polarisation are allowed is related to the axial symmetry of the cloud distribution .",
    "the switch exists due to a change in the scattering albedo between the soft and the hard bands of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "goosmann & matt ( 2011 ) showed that a more gradual rotation of @xmath12 can be obtained in a non - relativistic scenario once the distribution of scattering clouds is no longer symmetric .",
    "however , in this case the rotation can only evolve monotonically with photon energy between two limiting values determined by the net soft and hard x - ray polarisation states .",
    "such a scenario could not reproduce the s - shape variation of @xmath12 seen in the relativistic model .     in conclusion , this work predicts the polarisation degree expected from `` changing look '' agn in their compton - thin state . the reflection - dominated scenario of ngc  1365 is found to be associated with strong polarisation degrees and a smooth variation of polarisation angle across the iron line emission .",
    "however , if the spectrum of ngc  1365 is dominated by cloud absorption , lower polarisation degrees are expected , associated with an orthogonal switch of the polarisation position angle between the soft and the hard x - ray band .",
    "we strengthen the conclusions drawn in marin et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , despite some fundamental differences between mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  1365 , and demonstrate that x - ray polarimetry measurement of ngc  1365 could discriminate between the two scenario using a hard polarimeter or a large , soft x - ray polarimetric mission .",

    "<S> `` changing look '' active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are a subset of seyfert galaxies characterized by rapid transitions between compton - thin and compton - thick regimes . in their compton - thin state , </S>",
    "<S> the central engine is less obscured , hence spectroscopy or timing observations can probe their innermost structures . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not clear if the observed emission features and the compton hump are associated with relativistic reflection onto the accretion disc , or complex absorption by distant , absorbing gas clouds passing by the observer s line - of - sight . here , we investigate these two scenarios under the scope of x - ray polarimetry , providing the first polarisation predictions for an archetypal `` changing look '' agn : ngc  1365 . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the resulting polarisation emerging from lamp - post emission and scattering off an accretion disc in the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the computed polarisation signatures are compared to the results of an absorption - dominated model , where high column density gas partially covers the central source . while the shape of the polarisation spectrum is similar , </S>",
    "<S> the two models differ in net polarisation percentage , with the relativistic reflection scenario producing significantly stronger polarisation . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the variation of the polarisation position angle is distinctly different between both scenarios : the reflection - dominated model produces smooth rotations of the polarisation angle with photon energy whereas circumnuclear absorption causes an orthogonal switch of the polarisation angle between the soft and the hard x - ray bands . by comparing the predicted polarisation of ngc  1365 to the detectability levels of x - ray polarimetry mission concepts proposed in the past , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that with a large , soft x - ray observatory or a medium - sized mission equipped with a hard ( 6  35  kev ) polarimeter , the correct interpretation would be unambiguous .    </S>",
