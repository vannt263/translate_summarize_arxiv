    "immediately after the discovery of quantum mechanics , it was realized that it contains an interesting feature in quantum correlations between two particles .",
    "it was first discussed in seminal paper of einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) for the coordinate and momentum of a pair of massive particles @xcite and after a time reformulated for spin - entangled systems @xcite . assuming a pair of maximally entangled spin-1/2 particles we can perfectly predict the results of the complementary measurements on one particle from an appropriate measurements of the other one .",
    "an ability of the precise prediction of complementary variables arises from quantum nature of the correlations between the particles . from a fundamental point of view",
    "it was proved that for such the particles the measurements of correlated quantities should yield a different result in the quantum mechanical case to those expected in local realism .",
    "a condition derived in a form of bell inequality has to be satisfied within the local realism @xcite .",
    "the predictions of quantum mechanics were satisfactorily experimentally proved using pairs of photons entangled in the polarization @xcite . from a practical point of view , such the entangled particles distributed at a distance can be used to securely distribute classical information .",
    "an experiment demonstrating the interesting attribute of the correlations between quantum systems can be build up assuming a generally mixed state @xmath7 of qubit @xmath4 and meter qubit @xmath6 .",
    "this experiment is schematically depicted in fig .  1 . performing two projective ( ideal ) measurements @xmath5 on the qubit @xmath6",
    ", the prediction of the results of the complementary measurements @xmath3 on the qubit @xmath4 can be improved .",
    "the complementarity of the measurements means that @xmath10 .",
    "for example , having maximally entangled state @xmath11 , the results of arbitrary measurement @xmath12 on the qubit @xmath4 can be precisely predicted performing the same measurement @xmath12 on the qubit @xmath6 . however , without this measurement we have vanishing knowledge since the state of @xmath4 is maximally random . the total ability to predict the result of measurement",
    "was quantified by a concept of _ knowledge _ defined in @xcite .",
    "generally , there are such states for which the both complementary knowledges @xmath13 and @xmath14 obtained from the measurements @xmath5 are larger than these @xmath15 and @xmath16 without the measurements .",
    "then corresponding knowledge excesses @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be introduced , respectively for the complementary measurements .",
    "a duality between the knowledge excesses for any mixed state @xmath7 can be derived , analogically as in ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the knowledge excesses satisfy the inequality @xmath20 . thus performing a single measurement on @xmath6 , the sum of the squares of knowledge excesses can not be larger than unity .    in this paper , we analyze a duality between knowledge excesses beyond the condition @xmath19 and derive the following restriction of the complementary knowledge excesses @xmath21 and @xmath22 , namely @xmath23^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is maximal violation of bell inequalities @xcite after optimal local filtering operations on a single copy of the state @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath9 restricts the ability to enhance both the knowledge excesses by the different measurements on @xmath6 . to overcome the unit value of sum of squares of the knowledge excesses we need a state violating the bell inequality . for any state having vanishing the a priori knowledge in any basis ( for example , bell - diagonal state )",
    "we achieve the equality only by choosing appropriate measurements @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "such the state , exhibiting the maximal accessible @xmath9 under local filtering on a single copy and unitary operations , can be probabilistically but uniquely obtained from an arbitrary two - qubit state using local single - copy filtrations @xcite .",
    "thus the inequality ( [ main1 ] ) with @xmath9 can be always saturated assuming an appropriate local filtration before the suitable measurements @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "we analyze simple and experimentally feasible examples covering such the cases in which noise prevents an maximal extraction of knowledge .",
    "in this section we define the complementary knowledge excesses @xmath1 and @xmath22 and discuss a duality between them which arises from a single measurement on @xmath6 .",
    "assume two - component projective measurement @xmath24 giving results either @xmath25 or @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we expand the state @xmath7 as @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the meter operators @xmath29 depend on a choice of the measurement @xmath30 . to predict a result of @xmath30 on @xmath4",
    "we can unambiguously discriminate the mixed states @xmath31 by a projective two - component measurement @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) on the qubit @xmath6 .",
    "after projection @xmath35 , the local state of the qubit @xmath4 collapses to @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the probability of the projection .",
    "thus after the meter measurement we obtain two sub - ensembles of the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 weighted with probabilities @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we denote @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    adopting maximum likelihood estimation strategy",
    ", we guess for each event that the measurement @xmath30 gave the most likely results either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "our strategy is maximize the likelihood function @xmath44 .",
    "the knowledge in a binary decision problem is the fractional excess of right guesses over wrong guesses in many experiments repeated under identical conditions @xcite .",
    "if we have @xmath45 of right guesses and @xmath46 of wrong guesses than our knowledge is @xmath47 . in our task a priori knowledge without the measurement @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "a sub - ensemble knowledge after the particular projection @xmath35 is @xmath50 .",
    "then after the meter measurement , an amount of the knowledge @xmath51 is the @xmath52-weighted sum of sub - ensembles knowledges @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the knowledge excess @xmath1 is that amount of knowledge which exceeds the apriori knowledge @xmath55 , explicitly @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the knowledge excess quantifies only a part of knowledge which is gained from the measurement on @xmath6 .",
    "if we are not able to extract any extra knowledge from the measurement on @xmath6 then the knowledge excess is vanishing . using the expansion ( [ state ] )",
    "we have @xmath58 the largest @xmath1 over all @xmath48 is the distinguishability excess @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and thus @xmath62 . the analogical quantities @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be defined for the complementary measurement @xmath65 .",
    "now we shortly prove a relation between the knowledge excesses for @xmath19 .",
    "the derivation is inspired by a similar one in ref .",
    "the sub - ensemble knowledge about prediction of the complementary projection along the state @xmath66 , after a particular projection @xmath35 , is @xmath67\\leq 2\\sqrt{w_{i}w_{i}^{\\bot}}|c_{i}|$ ] .",
    "since @xmath68 we have @xmath69 and using schwarz inequality @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 then using ( [ know1 ] ) and ( [ help ] ) we can straightforwardly derive that for @xmath72 the knowledge excesses satisfy @xmath73 using the same measurement on @xmath6 , the sum of squares of the knowledge excesses can never overcome unity . it is a duality between the knowledge excesses from a single meter measurement .",
    "accomplishing generally different @xmath74 , @xmath48 , the sum of squares of the knowledge excesses can be larger than unity if the state violates the bell inequalities .",
    "let us discuss in this case a limitation of the knowledge excesses for any mixed state of the two - qubit system @xmath75 where @xmath26 stands for the identity operator , @xmath76 are vectors in @xmath77 , @xmath78 are the standard pauli operators and @xmath79 , @xmath80 are the eigenstates of @xmath81 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath82 form a real correlation matrix @xmath83 and vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 determine the local states @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "we assume a subset of states @xmath88 with the diagonal correlation tensor @xmath89 , @xmath90 and with vectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "any mixed state @xmath7 can be uniquely converted to some @xmath88 using appropriate local unitary operations .",
    "further we have the following ordering of the diagonal elements @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "since the prove for @xmath94 is only analogical we will shortly discuss afterward .    according to the strongest correlation @xmath95",
    ", one measurement on @xmath4 is naturally chosen as @xmath96 and from the expansion ( [ state ] ) we obtain using ( [ dist ] ) we have @xmath97 and either @xmath98 or @xmath99 . and according to the second strongest correlation @xmath100 , the complementary measurement is chosen as @xmath101 , @xmath102 and then we analogically have @xmath103 and either @xmath104 or @xmath105",
    ". we can also express a violation of bell inequalities in a simple way for such states with a diagonal @xmath106 .",
    "adopting criterion in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) , a state @xmath7 violates a bell inequality if its maximal bell factor is @xmath107 since the factor @xmath108 is invariant under local unitary transformations @xmath109 of the state .",
    "similarly , we can derive analogical result for the case when @xmath94 , either we have @xmath110 or @xmath99 and for the complementary measurement , either @xmath111 or @xmath112 and maximum of the bell factor is @xmath113 .",
    "then we can generally obtain that @xmath114 for arbitrary state @xmath7 with diagonal @xmath83 , where @xmath115 corresponds to the two largest correlations .",
    "the equality is obtained for the states having vanishing priori knowledge in any basis .",
    "now we generalize the discussion for any state @xmath7 assuming arbitrary measurements @xmath116 .",
    "any mixed two - qubit state can be uniquely prepared from the set of states @xmath88 by appropriate local unitary transformations @xmath117 on the qubits @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "further , the transformation of the measurements @xmath118 and @xmath119 to the arbitrary but still complementary ones effectively corresponds the extra local unitary transformation @xmath120 of the state qubit @xmath4 . since the distinguishabilities @xmath59 , @xmath121 are generally invariant under any local unitary transformation on the meter @xmath6 , it is sufficient to implement a joint unitary transformation @xmath122 only on the qubit @xmath4 .",
    "further we can preserve the measurements @xmath118 and @xmath119 in a general prove .    for any unitary transformations @xmath123",
    "there are unique rotations @xmath124 such that @xmath125 .",
    "if a state @xmath7 with diagonal @xmath106 is subjected to the @xmath126 transformation its correlation matrix transforms as follows @xcite @xmath127 thus a joint unitary transformation @xmath128 can be represented as a transformation of the correlation tensor @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the matrix of rotation in @xmath77 space @xmath131 with the elements @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "we explicitly calculate @xmath59 and @xmath136 for the state after the previous transformation .",
    "first we assume that @xmath93 .",
    "for the first measurement from the complementary measurements we obtain either @xmath137 or @xmath138 for the second complementary measurement is either @xmath139 or @xmath140 and using the transformation @xmath129 we can derive that @xmath141 consequently , assuming @xmath142 we can prove the following inequality @xmath143    for @xmath94 , by repeating our calculation we have for the first measurement the result ( [ disc1 ] ) the second complementary measurement is either @xmath144 or @xmath145 using ( [ elem ] ) we derive @xmath146 and subsequently , @xmath147    finally , since @xmath148 and @xmath149 we prove that @xmath150 is generally satisfied .",
    "thus the maximum of bell factor represents an important bound on the squares of the excess of knowledge which can be extracted from the meter measurements . for class of the states with vanishing priori knowledge for any measurements @xmath3 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath151 , this inequality can be saturated only by an appropriate choice of the measurements @xmath116 . for a mixture of bell states ( [ mixbell ] )",
    "we can find that @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 which saturates the relation ( [ ineq1 ] ) .",
    "it was shown that local filtering operations on single copy of the state can increase the degree of violation of bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "there is a unique local ( stochastically reversible ) filtering operation @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) on single copy of the state @xmath159 which transforms with some non - zero probability any two - qubit mixed state into a state which is diagonal in bell basis @xmath160 having the largest @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "a two - qubit mixed state can be uniquely bring to this bell diagonal form with the maximal violation either with finite probability or asymptotically .",
    "for the bell diagonal states , the bell violation can not be increased by any local filtering on a single copy .",
    "naturally , after the local filtering the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is still satisfied also for the remaining state @xmath162 .",
    "the bell diagonal states have both the local states maximally disordered , both the apriori knowledges vanish and we can always saturate the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) with the upper bound given by @xmath163 only by an appropriate choice of the measurements @xmath116 . thus assuming that @xmath9 in the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is then maximum under local filtering and unitary operations on a single copy of the state , the inequality is satisfied for any mixed state and can be for any mixed state saturated if we use an appropriate local filtering .",
    "we analyze two interesting and experimentally feasible examples of the bell - diagonal states . in both cases",
    ", we can use as a source state the maximally entangled state @xmath164 produced by the spdc process .",
    "evidently , the source state maximally violates bell inequalities and has @xmath165 .",
    "in the first example , we simultaneously perform a depolarization by ( i ) random flip of linear polarizations @xmath166 with the probability @xmath167 and simultaneously , by ( ii ) phase - shift @xmath168 between linear polarizations @xmath169 . as a result of the depolarizing procedure",
    "we prepare a mixture of bell states @xmath170 for this case , the distinguishability excess is @xmath171 and vanishes only if the random polarization flip has larger probability , whereas the complementary distinguishability excess is @xmath172 and decreases only with an increasing probability of the random polarization phase - shift .",
    "the maximal value of bell factor is @xmath173 and the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) is saturated .",
    "thus we can independently control both the complementary distinguishability excesses .",
    "for @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) and changing @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) we are able to extract the maximal unit distinguishability excess @xmath178",
    "( @xmath179 ) irrespective to the complementary one @xmath180 ( @xmath178 ) . for @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) and controlling @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) , the depolarization prevents us to extract any knowledge excess since @xmath183 ( @xmath111 ) however we are still able to obtain the complementary knowledge excess @xmath184 ( @xmath184 ) .    in the second example",
    ", we show as both @xmath178 and @xmath185 can be gradually enhanced sharing separable state , entangled state which satisfies the bell inequalities and consequently , sharing entangled state violating bell inequalities .",
    "we assume a loss of both the knowledge excesses from the state @xmath186 by an extraction of the photon in the meter beam with probability @xmath187 and its substitution by another photon with a completely random polarization .",
    "thus we detect the results produced by a mixture of the bell states which is known as werner state @xcite @xmath188 in this case , a loss of the distinguishability excesses with decreasing @xmath189 are identical @xmath190 . we know that the werner s state is entangled only for @xmath191 and violates bell inequalities , having maximum of bell factor @xmath192 , only if @xmath193 .",
    "also in this case , the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) can be saturated .",
    "since we have an entangled state non - violating bell inequalities for @xmath194 and non - entangled state for @xmath195 it means that we can observe both non - vanishing distinguishability excesses @xmath196 and @xmath197 even in a case of classical correlated states .",
