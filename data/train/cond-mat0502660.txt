    "in order to investigate the fundamental properties of magnetic nanoparticles and the novelties they exhibit , new materials had to be made and characterized [ see , e.g. , the recent review articles @xcite ] . nowadays , there are mainly two prototypes of nanoparticle samples : i ) assemblies of , e.g. , cobalt , nickel or maghemite nanoparticles @xcite embedded in a non - magnetic matrix with volume distribution and randomly oriented easy axes , with negligible - to - strong dipole - dipole inter - particle interactions ( ddi ) , depending on concentration ; ii ) isolated single particles of cobalt or nickel measured by the technique of @xmath0-squid @xcite .",
    "technological applications require to some extent ever denser assemblies and thus smaller particles .",
    "however , this leads to a dilemma because small particles become superparamagnetic at even low temperatures , and an optimum material [ with appropriate anisotropy and other physical parameters ] has still to be devised .",
    "moreover , high density entails strong ddi among the particles , and in technological applications such as magnetic recording , this is an issue of special importance because ddi have been widely recognized as being responsible for the deterioration of the signal - to - noise ratio [ see e.g. , refs .   and references therein ] .",
    "experimentally , investigation of the effect of dipolar interactions in nanoparticle assemblies has revealed many new phenomena pertaining to the collective behavior of the particles , notably the so - called _ spin - glass state _ at low temperature in concentrated assemblies @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , owing to the long - range of inter - particle ddi .",
    "it has also been observed that the field behavior of the temperature @xmath1 at the maximum of the zero - field - cooled magnetization strongly depends on the concentration of the assembly  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "more precisely , the maximum of @xmath1 as a function of the applied field observed in dilute samples disappears when the concentration of the latter is increased . today",
    ", there arises a more fundamental issue about assemblies of nanoparticles that concerns the understanding of the interplay between the _ intrinsic _ properties , such as those pertaining to surface effects , and _ extrinsic _ or collective effects stemming from the long - range ddi .",
    "many research groups have experimentally studied this interplay in cobalt and maghemite particle assemblies .",
    "measurements of the magnetization at high fields performed on the @xmath2-fe@xmath3o@xmath4 nanoparticles @xcite,@xcite , [ see @xcite for cobalt particles ] have shown that the magnetization is strongly influenced by surface effects , depending on the particle size .",
    "for instance , fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that i ) there is a sudden increase of the magnetization as a function of the applied field when the temperature reaches @xmath5 k , and the magnetization does not saturate at the highest available field , i.e. , 5.5 t. ii ) there is an important increase of the magnetization at low temperature , iii ) the thermal behavior of the magnetization at 5.5 t is such that the smaller is the mean diameter of the particle the faster is the increase of the magnetization at very low temperature . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the situation involving both surface effects and dipolar interactions has never been considered so far mainly because of its tremendous complexities , and also because one has first to understand these two effects separately .",
    "needless to say that , already at the static level , no exact analytical treatment of any kind is ever possible even in the one - spin approximation , i.e. , ignoring the internal structure of the particles and thereby surface effects . only numerical approaches such as the monte carlo technique can relieve some of this frustration .",
    "indeed , applications of this technique to the case of ising dipoles can be found in ref  @xcite .",
    "the same technique has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to study hysteretic properties of monodisperse assemblies of nanoparticles with the more realistic heisenberg spin model , in the one - spin approximation where each particle carries a net magnetic moment . in ref .",
    ", the landau - lifshitz thermodynamic perturbation theory  @xcite is used to tackle the case of weakly dipolar - interacting monodisperse assemblies of magnetic moments with uniformly or randomly distributed anisotropy axes .",
    "the authors studied the influence of ddi on the susceptibility and specific heat of the assembly . in the present work",
    ", we use the same approach as in ref .   with the objective to study the effect of anisotropy and ( weak ) dipolar interactions on the field and temperature behavior of the magnetization of a monodisperse and polydisperse assembly of magnetic moments .",
    "for this purpose , we consider an assembly of magnetic moments whose magnitudes are distributed according to a gaussian or ( the more often observed ) lognormal law .",
    "the anisotropy is taken as uniaxial and either textured along some reference axis or randomly distributed .",
    "the statistical average of the assembly magnetization is obtained , for weak ddi , using the thermodynamic perturbation theory , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here the magnetic field is explicitly included in the assembly magnetic energy .",
    "the low field regime , dealt with in ref .",
    ", is generalized here so as to take account of polydispersity and ddi .",
    "in high fields , the magnetization as a function of temperature and field is computed using the steepest - descent approximation . in the general range of temperature , field , and anisotropy ,",
    "the magnetization of a non - interacting assembly is computed exactly by numerical integration of the single - moment ( free ) partition function or using the monte - carlo simulation technique . for interacting assemblies",
    ", we use the monte carlo technique .",
    "one of the objectives is to provide ready - to - use ( semi ) analytical formulae for the field and temperature dependence of the assembly magnetization that take into account moment and easy axes distributions , and weak dipolar interactions .",
    "moreover , we investigate the effect of anisotropy and ddi and discuss the validity of the langevin law , for both textured and random - anisotropy , which is invariably used in the literature to interpret the magnetization measurements on nanoparticle assemblies .",
    "the present work is also an extension of the study in ref .",
    "@xcite where anisotropy was ignored .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : section [ energy ] defines the energy and notation .",
    "the first new results of the present work appear in section [ magnetization ] where we use perturbation theory to derive an analytical expression for the magnetization taking account of ddi .",
    "then , we give approximate expressions in the limiting cases of low and high field regimes , for both a free and interacting particle , and for both monodisperse and polydisperse assemblies .",
    "we compare these expressions with the exact numerical calculation , and also discuss the effect of anisotropy .",
    "this section ends with a monte carlo calculation and discussion of the corresponding results of more realistic assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles , namely assemblies with the lognormal distribution for the magnetic moments derived from experimental data of nanoparticle assemblies with mean diameter @xmath6 and @xmath7 nm .",
    "the last section is a conclusion and statement of a few open problems to be dealt with in future investigations .",
    "consider an assembly of magnetic moments @xmath8 of magnitude @xmath9 and direction @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic moment @xmath12 is then defined in terms of the bohr magneton @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 , and the numbers @xmath15 are either all equal for monodisperse assemblies or chosen according to some distribution , the so - called polydisperse assemblies .",
    "each magnetic moment will have a uniaxial easy axis @xmath16 , and for an assembly these may be either all directed along some reference axis leading to a textured assembly , or randomly distributed .",
    "the latter case will be referred to as random anisotropy .",
    "hence , the energy of a magnetic moment @xmath12 interacting with all the others via ddi , in the magnetic field @xmath17 , reads [ after multiplying by @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vector joining the sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 and whose magnitude is measured in units of @xmath23 , a characteristic length on the lattice to be evaluated later on . since we are considering assemblies with moment instead of volume distribution , the volume @xmath24 in ( [ osp_energy_1 ] ) is rewritten in terms of @xmath15 via the saturation magnetization of the material per unit volume @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 . for convenience",
    "we introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath27 and define @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath29 is the commonly used notation for the reduced anisotropy - barrier height of the particle @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we rewrite ( [ osp_energy_1 ] ) as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the free particle energy . in what follows",
    "we also occasionally use the dimensionless magnetic moment vector @xmath32 , and the ddi term is rewritten as a quadratic form in @xmath33 @xmath34 where we have introduced the ddi tensor @xcite @xmath35",
    "in order to calculate the thermal - equilibrium average of any observable @xmath36 we have to average over each particle s moment direction @xmath10 , the direction of its easy axis @xmath16 , and the magnitude @xmath9 of its moment ( or equivalently @xmath15 ) . the average of @xmath37 with respect to spatial orientations of all spins is @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . in particular ,",
    "the magnetization component along the field taken , for instance , along @xmath42 , of a single particle @xmath21 is given by @xmath43 which is a function of the easy - axis direction @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the parameters @xmath46 ( or equivalently @xmath47 ) .",
    "next , we infer the magnetization of the assembly per particle as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is some distribution of the bohr magneton numbers @xmath15 .",
    "therefore one first has to compute the magnetization of a single particle defined in ( [ direction_average ] ) .",
    "analytically , this can only be done in the case of weak ddi using thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this operates by expanding the boltzmann distribution @xmath50 in powers of the interaction parameter @xmath51 , that is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the boltzmann distribution of the non - interacting ( free ) ensemble , and @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the directional partition function of the @xmath56 free particle . for the system considered here ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are some quadratic , respectively quartic , functionals of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the average of an observable @xmath37 is reduced to the calculation of averages with respect to the distribution @xmath60 of low powers of the spin variables .",
    "henceforth , the average with respect to @xmath60 will be denoted by @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , to second order in the interaction parameter @xmath62 , the average of any physical observable @xmath37 reads , @xmath63 with , @xmath64 where , @xmath65 @xmath66 with @xmath67 annihilating terms containing duplicate pairs : @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast with the situation in ref .  , the @xmath69-order averages @xmath70 do not vanish here due to the presence of the external field .",

    "confirmed in section [ subsec : ddi_effect ] below , for non spherical systems , the corrections to the magnetization are largely dominated by the first order contribution to the ddi .    upon examining eq .",
    "( [ mz_final ] ) one sees that the magnetization of an interacting particle is written in terms of the magnetization of the free particle and its derivatives . in order to render this expression more explicit and thereby more useful from a practical point of view",

    "so , next we compute the free - particle magnetization @xmath90 and its derivative with respect to @xmath91 .",
    "the free - particle ( reduced ) magnetization is given by @xmath92 this can be computed exactly by numerical integration upon changing to spherical coordinates .",

    "( [ average_m0_num2 ] ) is valid for all values of @xmath96 and @xmath91 ( or @xmath97 , and @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , numerical integration is very time consuming , and knowing that we have to do this for all particles and then average over the two distributions , renders this expression of little practical interest .",

    "for example , fig .",
    "[ asymp_num ] shows such a comparison for a monodisperse assembly and random anisotropy .",
    "it is clear that the asymptotic expressions are good enough .",
    "moreover , even at a relatively high temperature ( here small @xmath96 ) , for which the steepest - descent approximation is expected to work worst because @xmath91 becomes small , expression ( [ averaged_sda ] ) renders a good approximation .",

    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ osp_ass_unidist_rand ] .",
    "this clearly shows that as @xmath96 increases , or equivalently at a fixed temperature and increasing anisotropy constant , the magnetization drops . indeed",
    ", stronger anisotropy implies that it is more favorable for the magnetic moments to align along their randomly oriented easy axes , and so the zeeman energy is not sufficient to align them along the field direction , as is clearly shown by eq .",
    "( [ averaged_lf ] ) , ( [ averaged_sda ] ) .",
    "this holds for both monodisperse and polydisperse assemblies .",
    "note also that the zero or very weak anisotropy curves coincide with the langevin function @xmath145 , which simply confirms the fact that langevin s law is only rigorously valid in the absence of anisotropy or at high temperature , or more precisely in the superparamagnetic regime . on the contrary , for a textured assembly [ whose results are not shown here ] all easy axes are parallel and obviously stronger anisotropy leads to larger magnetization .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of anisotropy on the magnetization of some typical nanoparticle assemblies with the most often observed volume ( or @xmath146 ) distribution in samples of magnetic nanoparticles , namely the lognormal distribution with parameters @xmath147 , @xmath148.\\ ] ] we consider assemblies of , e.g. , cobalt or maghemite , nanoparticles with mean diameter @xmath149 and @xmath7 nm . we simulate the assembly as a collection of magnetic moments randomly assigned to the sites of a regular simple cubic lattice .",
    "the moment magnitude distribution is taken from experiments @xcite upon converting the volume or diameter to the corresponding number of bohr magnetons @xmath146 .    the magnetization of these assemblies is computed using the standard equilibrium monte carlo technique @xcite at arbitrary temperature , applied field , and ddi parameter @xmath62 . for a non - interacting assembly the field behavior of the magnetization , for different values of the parameter @xmath96 is shown in figs .",
    "[ poly_ass_size_effect ] . in fig .",
    "[ poly_ass_size_effect]a we observe that , in the high field regime , the conclusions drawn from fig .  [ osp_ass_unidist_rand ] are confirmed in the present case too .",
    "that is , the higher is @xmath96 , the lower is the magnetization .",
    "on the other hand , in low fields this is not globally so because the competition between zeeman , thermal and anisotropy contributions to the energy , for this distribution , results in a crossing between the various magnetization curves , as has been observed , e.g. , for maghemite particles [ see @xcite ( fig .",
    "10 ) and @xcite ] .",
    "in fact , this situation is reminiscent of the two phases [ blocked and superparamagnetic ] exhibited by the zero - field - cooled magnetization , and separated by the temperature @xmath150 at the peak .",
    "more precisely , at a given applied field @xmath136 , if @xmath91 is sufficiently large , @xmath151 is smaller than @xmath150 , and thus the larger is the anisotropy and/or particle volume , the higher is the energy barrier , and the smaller is the magnetization , because most of the particles remain in their blocked states with almost randomly oriented moments . in the opposite situation ,",
    "small @xmath91 corresponds to high temperature , and in this case anisotropy has a negligible effect , so that a higher volume corresponds to a higher magnetic moment ( or @xmath146 ) and thereby to a higher zeeman energy , which is necessary to take over the strong thermal fluctuations .",
    "higher zeeman energy , of course , builds larger magnetization .",
    "equally important is the observation of the related effect , also observed experimentally in maghemite particles [ see e.g. , fig .  10 of ref .  ] , that the magnetization as a function of field [ see fig .",

    "indeed , we recall that it was shown by luttinger and tisza @xcite [ see also the more recent work @xcite using the monte carlo technique ] that the ground state of a simple cubic lattice of dipoles is antiferromagnetic , while that of a face - centered cubic lattice is ferromagnetic .",
    "it is also seen that these curves deviate from the langevin law .",
    "however , we emphasize that the deviations induced by ddi are much smaller than those induced by anisotropy , as already discussed earlier [ see also ref .   for a related discussion of the effect of the system shape on the magnetic susceptibility of a monodisperse assembly ] . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ osp_ass_ddi_mc_sda ] the same results are magnified by plotting them in function of @xmath192 , i.e. , the ratio of zeeman energy to the ddi energy , which also makes it possible to distinctively plot the analytical expressions ( [ lfhf_ddi_mag ] ) for low field . in the case of high field",
    "only one curve ( @xmath193 , i.e. , relatively strong ddi ) is presented since for the other values of ddi parameter @xmath191 , the steepest - descent approximation is valid for much higher values of @xmath194 .",
    "note also that in function of the parameter @xmath194 the tendency with increasing ddi strength is reversed .",
    "we have provided simple approximate analytical expressions for the magnetization of a weakly interacting polydisperse assembly of magnetic moments with randomly distributed easy axes , in both low and high field regimes .",
    "these expressions have been checked against extact calculations using either numerical integration of the partition function or monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have also computed the magnetization of such systems for an arbitrary inter - particle separation , or equivalently arbitrary intensity of dipole - dipole interactions , using the monte carlo technique . however , in this case only assembly of limited sizes could be dealt with , as the calculation speed is reduced to a crawl by the long - ranged ddi .",
    "we have investigated the deviations caused by random anisotropy , ddi , and polydispersity , from the langevin law that is commonly invariably used in the literature to describe the magnetization of real materials .",
    "we have also found that more realistic assemblies with a lognormal volume distribution , render a magnetization that exhibits two different regimes as a function of the applied field , with different variation slopes , as has been observed in experiments on maghemite particles . moreover , as a byproduct , we find that the magnetization of an assembly of nanoparticles in the one - spin approximation considered here , i.e. , with each particle represented by a macro - spin , does saturate in high fields .",
    "this suggests that the magnetization non - saturation observed in experiments on small particles is most likely due to some intrinsic properties of the particles , such as surface effects , as has been argued in many publications [ see e.g. , @xcite and many references therein ] .    for future investigation",
    ", we intend to apply the fast - fourier - transform technique to speed up the monte carlo calculations especially for interacting assemblies of more reasonable sizes , and take account , _",
    "inter alia _ , of random spatial distributions of the particles on the lattice . using the kinetic monte carlo technique",
    ", we also intend to investigate the disappearance of the maximum in @xmath195 as the concentration of the assembly is increased , and also the appearance of the spin - glass like state at low temperature . for the latter purpose , we will most likely have to tackle the problem of an assembly of multi - spin particles .",
    "we thank yu .",
