    "several lines of evidence suggest that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are powered by accretion onto a super - massive black hole ( bh ) ( lynden - bell 1969 ; rees 1984 ) .",
    "the much higher volume - number density of agns observed at redshift @xmath4 than at @xmath5 , suggests that many quiescent ( or ` normal ' ) galaxies today must have gone through an active phase in the past , and therefore harbor a massive bh as well .",
    "such a bh will significantly influence the dynamics of the galaxy inside a radius of influence , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a characteristic velocity dispersion of the stars in the center .",
    "in particular , hydrostatic equilibrium requires that the rms velocities of the stars surrounding a massive bh follow an @xmath8 power - law ( bahcall & wolf 1976 ; young 1980 ) .    since the late 70s , combined imaging and spectroscopy of the central regions of galaxies has suggested that massive bhs should be present in a number of early - type galaxies ( see kormendy & richstone 1995 for a review ) .",
    "conclusive dynamical evidence for the presence of a central bh requires that a model with a bh can fit all observations ( photometric and kinematic ) , and that no model without a bh can provide an equally good fit .",
    "such conclusive evidence can only be inferred from observations that probe well inside the radius where the bh dominates the dynamics . up",
    "to a few years ago , most claimed bh detections were based on observations with spatial resolutions of similar size as the radii of influence of the inferred bh masses ( rix 1993 ) .",
    "this , together with the limited amount of freedom in the models used to interpret the data , has hampered an unambiguous proof for the presence of these bhs ( i.e. , the observed kinematics could not be confronted with all possible dynamical configurations without a bh ) .",
    "often spherical models were used even when the observed flattening was significant . if the models were axisymmetric , the distribution function ( hereafter df ) was often assumed to depend only on the two classical integrals of motion , energy and vertical angular momentum ; @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that the velocity dispersions in the radial and vertical directions are equal ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is well - known that strong radial anisotropy in the center of a galaxy results in a high central velocity dispersion , mimicking the presence of a massive bh ( cf .",
    "binney & mamon 1982 ) .",
    "conclusive evidence for a bh therefore requires that one can rule out radial anisotropy as the cause of the high velocity dispersions measured , and models must thus be sufficiently general .",
    "recently two major breakthroughs have initiated a new era in the search for massive bhs in normal galaxies .",
    "first of all , we can now obtain kinematics at much higher spatial resolution ( down to fwhm @xmath11 ) , using specially - designed spectrographs , such as the subarcsecond imaging spectrograph ( sis ) on the canada - france hawaii telescope , or the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and stis aboard the hst .",
    "this allows us to probe the gravitational potential much closer to the center , where the bh dominates the dynamics .",
    "not only has this improved the evidence for massive bhs in several old bh - candidate galaxies ( m31 , ford et al .  1998",
    "; m32 , van der marel et al .  1997 , 1998 ;",

    "1996b ) , but it has also provided new cases ( m84 , bower et al .",

    "ngc  6251 , ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1998 ; and ngc  7052 , van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ) . secondly",
    ", the revolutionary increase in computer power has made it possible to investigate a large number of fully general , three - integral models based on the orbit - superposition method ( schwarzschild 1979 ) . in the past decade , this method has been used to build a variety of spherical , axisymmetric and triaxial models ( e.g. , schwarzschild 1982 ; pfenniger 1984 ; richstone & tremaine 1984 , 1988 ; zhao 1996 ) .",
    "levison & richstone ( 1985 ) , richstone & tremaine ( 1985 ) , and pfenniger ( 1984 ) showed how to include rotation velocities and velocity dispersions as kinematic constraints . more recently , rix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and cretton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) extended this modeling technique even further by fitting to the _ entire _ velocity profiles ( see also richstone 1997 ) .",
    "van der marel et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) used this to build fully general , axisymmetric models of m32 , and showed convincingly that m32 harbors a massive bh .",
    "recent review papers on this rapidly evolving field include ford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , ho ( 1998 ) , richstone ( 1998 ) , and van der marel ( 1998 ) .    in many galaxies where the presence of a bh has been suggested , a nuclear disk , seen close to edge - on ,",
    "is present .",
    "these disks are either in gaseous form ( m84 , m87 , ngc  4261 , ngc  4594 , ngc  6251 , ngc  7052 ) , or made up of stars ( ngc  3115 ) .",
    "it is easier to detect bhs in edge - on systems with disks , where one can use both the measured rotation velocities and the velocity dispersions to determine the central mass density .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that bhs have predominantly been found in galaxies with nuclear disks .",
    "furthermore , nuclear disks allow a good determination of the central mass density of their host galaxies .",
    "gaseous disks have the advantage that their kinematics can be easily measured from emission lines .",
    "since gas in a steady - state disk can only move on non - intersecting orbits , the measured rotation velocities of a settled gas disk , in the equatorial plane of an axisymmetric potential , correspond to the circular velocities , @xmath12 .",
    "the rotation curve of a nuclear gas disk therefore provides a direct measure of the central potential gradient , and thus of the central mass density .",
    "however , often the gas disks are not in a steady state ; many show a distorted morphology ( e.g. m87 , see ford et al .",
    "1994 ) , and non - gravitational motion , such as outflow , inflow or turbulence can be present and complicate the dynamical analysis ( e.g. , ngc  4261 , jaffe et al .",
    "1996 ; ngc  7052 , van den bosch & van der marel 1995 ) . nuclear _ stellar _",
    "disks do not suffer from this , but have the disadvantage that their kinematics are much harder to measure .",
    "first of all , the kinematics have to be determined from absorption lines rather than emission lines , and secondly , the line - of - sight velocity distributions , or velocity profiles ( vps ) , measured are ` contaminated ' by light from the bulge component .",
    "however , van den bosch & de zeeuw ( 1996 ) showed that with sufficient spatial and spectral resolution one can resolve the vps in a broad bulge - component and a narrow disk - component . from these vps the rotation curve of the nuclear disk can be derived , providing an accurate measure for the central mass density .",
    "therefore , galaxies with an embedded nuclear disk ( either gaseous or stellar ) observed close to edge - on are ideal systems to investigate the presence of massive bhs .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the case of ngc  4342 ; a small , low - luminosity ( @xmath13 ) s0 galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "the galaxy is listed as ic  3256 in both the second and third reference catalogues of bright galaxies , since in the past it has occasionally been confused with ngc  4341 and ngc  4343 ( see zwicky & herzog 1966 ) . at a projected distance of @xmath14 se of ngc  4342",
    ", a small galaxy is visible .",
    "it is uncertain whether this is a real companion of ngc  4342 or whether it is merely close in projection .",
    "hst images of ngc  4342 revealed both an outer disk , as well as a very bright nuclear stellar disk inside @xmath15 ( van den bosch et al .",
    "1994 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "it is a normal galaxy , with no detected ism ( roberts et al .",
    "1991 ) , and with small color - gradients ( van den bosch , jaffe & van der marel 1998 , hereafter bjm98 ) . for its size and luminosity",
    ", it does however reveal a remarkably large central velocity dispersion and a very steep rotation - curve ( see bjm98 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral resolution of the available kinematic data is insufficient to actually resolve the vps in disk and bulge components . in order to determine the central mass density in ngc  4342",
    ", we thus have to construct dynamical models of the entire system : bulge and disk components . here",
    "we present simple two - integral jeans models as well as fully general three - integral models , and we provide evidence for the presence of a central massive dark object ( mdo ) of @xmath16 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the mdo to be a bh , but we discuss alternatives in section  7.2    in section  2 we briefly discuss the data used to constrain the models and in section  3 we describe our mass model . in section  4 we show the results of some simple two - integral modeling , and we discuss its shortcomings .",
    "section  5 describes the general outline of the three - integral modeling technique . in section  6",
    "we discuss shortcomings of the velocity - profile parameterization used when applied to dynamically cold systems , and present a modified approach .",
    "the results of the three ",
    "integral modeling are discussed in section  7 . finally , in section  8 , we sum up and present our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a distance of 15 mpc for ngc  4342 , consistent with the distance of the virgo cluster ( jacoby , ciardullo & ford 1990 ) .",
    "all data used in this paper are presented and discussed in detail in bjm98 . here",
    "we merely summarize .",
    "bjm98 used the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the hst to obtain @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 band photometry of ngc  4342 .",
    "the spatial resolution of these images is limited by the hst point spread function ( fwhm @xmath11 ) and the size of the pixels ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the full field - of - view covers about @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mge ] shows contour plots at two different scales of the @xmath19-band image .",
    "the presence of the nuclear disk is evident from the highly flattened , disky isophotes inside @xmath22 .      using the isis spectrograph mounted at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at la palma , bjm98 obtained long - slit spectra of ngc  4342 along both the major and the minor axis .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of @xmath23 , and were obtained with a slit width of @xmath22 under good seeing conditions with a psf fwhm of @xmath24 ( major axis ) and @xmath25 ( minor axis ) . after standard reduction , the parameters @xmath26 that best fit the vps were determined using the method described in van der marel ( 1994 ) .",
    "these parameters quantify the gauss - hermite ( gh ) expansion of the velocity profile @xmath27 as introduced by van der marel & franx ( 1993 ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the line - of - sight velocity , @xmath32 are the hermite polynomials of degree @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the gauss - hermite coefficients . the first term in equation  ( [ ghseries ] )",
    "represents a gaussian with line strength @xmath35 , mean radial velocity @xmath18 , and velocity dispersion @xmath7 .",
    "the even gh - coefficients quantify symmetric deviations of the vp from the best - fitting gaussian , and the odd coefficients quantify the asymmetric deviations .",
    "we have averaged the kinematic wht data at positive and negative radii . in this way we obtain sets of @xmath36 at 19 different positions along the major axis and 8 along the minor axis .",
    "bjm98 also obtained fos spectra at 7 different aperture - positions , all inside the central @xmath37 of ngc  4342 , using the circular @xmath38-diameter aperture ( the fos 0.3-aperture ) . due to the limited signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath39 ) of these spectra",
    ", only @xmath40 of the best - fitting gaussian could be determined .",
    "rotation velocities and velocity dispersions along the major axis of ngc  4342 for both the wht ( crosses ) and fos ( solid dots ) are shown in figure  [ fig : kinemdat ] .",
    "the central rotation gradient , as measured with the fos , is extremely steep ( @xmath41 at @xmath42 from the center ) .",
    "in addition , the velocity dispersion increases from @xmath43 at the outside ( the ` cold ' outer disk ) to @xmath44 in the center as measured with the wht .",
    "the central velocity dispersion increases to @xmath45 , when observed at four times higher spatial resolution with the fos .",
    "we have used the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) method developed by emsellem , monnet & bacon ( 1994 , hereafter emb94 ) to build a mass model for ngc  4342 .",
    "the method assumes that both the psf and the intrinsic surface brightness are described by a sum of gaussians , each of which has 6 free parameters : the center @xmath46 , the position angle , the flattening @xmath47 , the central intensity @xmath48 , and the size of the gaussian along the major axis , expressed by its standard deviation @xmath49 .",
    "the best - fitting parameters of the different gaussians are determined using an iterative approach in which additional components are added until convergence is achieved ( see emb94 for details on the method ) .",
    "this method is well suited for complicated , multi - component galaxies such as ngc  4342 .",
    "we fitted the hst @xmath19-band psf by a sum of 5 circular ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) gaussians ( see bjm98 ) . using this model psf we derived the parameters of the @xmath51 gaussians describing the intrinsic surface brightness ( i.e. , deconvolved for psf effects ) by fitting to the hst @xmath19-band image of ngc  4342 .",
    "we forced the @xmath51 gaussians to have the same position angle and center , which yields an axisymmetric mass model ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , the model is described by @xmath52 free parameters , which are simultaneously fit to the image .",
    "we achieved convergence with @xmath53 gaussian components .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in figure  [ fig : mge ] , where we show contour plots of the @xmath19-band image with superimposed contours of the convolved surface brightness of the mge model .",
    "the fit is excellent , except for a small discrepancy at the outside .",
    "this is due to slight twisting of the isophotes at large radii ( see bjm98 ) . since our model is axisymmetric",
    ", this can not be modeled . nevertheless , the discrepancy is small , and is unlikely to affect our conclusions on the dynamics of the central region .",
    "the parameters of the different gaussian components are listed in table  1 .",
    "the total luminosity of the mge model in the @xmath19-band is @xmath54 .",
    "this yields @xmath55 .",
    "the absolute blue magnitude of ngc  4342 , at a distance of 15 mpc , is @xmath13 ( sandage & tammann 1981 ) , and we thus find @xmath56 .",
    "this is consistent with the colors of ngc  4342 presented by bjm98 .",
    "they find @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we thus derive @xmath59 , in good agreement with the average value for early - type galaxies ( faber et al .",
    "if we assume that the luminosity distribution of the bulge corresponds to the gaussian components rounder than @xmath60 , we find that the bulge makes up @xmath61 per cent of the total luminosity of ngc  4342 .",
    "the outer disk , described by gaussian components  9 and  10 , makes up an additional @xmath62 per cent , and the nuclear disk ( modeled by gaussian component 4 ) adds only about @xmath63 per cent to the total luminosity . there is no reason that the mathematical components correspond to actual physical components , but at least this gives an order - of - magnitude description of the luminosities of the bulge and the two disk components . a more accurate disk - bulge decomposition , which yields similar results , is discussed in scorza & van den bosch ( 1998 ) .",
    "assuming that the density is built up from a sum of three - dimensional gaussians stratified on spheroids , one can , for any inclination angle @xmath64 , analytically calculate the density distribution from the mge fit to the intrinsic surface brightness .",
    "the mass density of such an mge model is given by @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the mass - to - light ratio , and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are related to @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath47 and @xmath64 ( see emb94 ) .",
    "the potential that corresponds to this density distribution follows from solving the poisson equation .",
    "this yields @xmath70   { { \\rm d}t \\over \\sqrt{1 - e_j^2 t^2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath71 .",
    "the inclination angle is well constrained by the thinness of the nuclear disk : @xmath72 ( scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) . throughout",
    "we assume that ngc  4342 is observed edge - on ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) .",
    "given the lower limit on the inclination angle of @xmath74 , this assumption does not significantly influence the conclusions presented in this paper .",
    "the three - integral modeling described in the next section requires large amounts of cpu time .",
    "we therefore decided to first explore parameter space of the models ( i.e. , mass - to - light ratio and mass of the possible bh ) by solving the jeans equations and assuming that the phase  space distribution function depends only on the two classical integrals of motion .",
    "the jeans equations for hydrostatic equilibrium are moment equations of the collisionless boltzmann equation ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "they relate the velocity dispersion tensor @xmath75 and the streaming motion @xmath76 to the density @xmath77 and potential @xmath78 . for an axisymmetric system with distribution function @xmath79 one",
    "always has @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and the jeans equations in cylindrical coordinates reduce to @xmath82 @xmath83 here @xmath84 denotes the local average over velocities . from equation  ( [ jeansequat ] ) and @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    ", one can , at every point @xmath87 in the meridional plane , calculate @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) by simple integration . by rewriting equation  ( [ jeanseq ] )",
    ", one can compute @xmath90 without the need of performing a numerical ( ill - conditioned ) derivative ( see e.g. hunter 1977 ; simien , pellet & monnet 1979 ; binney , davies & illingworth 1990 ) .",
    "the expressions for @xmath88 and @xmath91 for the density distribution of equation ( [ mgedens ] ) are given in emb94 ( their equations  [ 42 ] and  [ 44 ] ) .",
    "the jeans equations do not prescribe how @xmath91 splits in streaming motion @xmath92 and azimuthal velocity dispersion @xmath93 .",
    "we follow the approach introduced by satoh ( 1980 ) , and write @xmath94 such that we can control the anisotropy @xmath95 by means of the free parameter @xmath96 . for @xmath97",
    "the model is fully isotropic with @xmath98 .",
    "once @xmath96 has been fixed one can project the luminosity - weighted dynamical quantities on the plane of the sky @xmath99 to yield the projected rotation velocities @xmath100 and the rms velocities @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the luminosity density and @xmath103 is the projected surface brightness at position @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105 are the true first and second order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution .",
    "the projected velocity dispersion @xmath106 is simply derived from @xmath107 it is straightforward to include a bh in such a model , by simply adding @xmath108 to the stellar potential ( [ mgepot ] ) .",
    "we use the jeans equations to calculate the predicted rotation velocities and velocity dispersions for the luminosity distribution of ngc 4342 .",
    "we assume that the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath66 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath96 are constant throughout the galaxy .",
    "we calculate @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( using equations [ [ vroteq ] ] and [ [ vrmseq ] ] ) on a two - dimensional grid on the sky .",
    "the grid is logarithmic in @xmath109 ( in order to properly sample the strong gradients near the center ) , and linearly sampled in @xmath110 .",
    "once @xmath104 and @xmath105 are tabulated , we convolve them with the psf of the observations , weighted by the surface brightness .",
    "after pixel binning , taking the proper slit width into account , these are compared to the observations .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath7 determined from the gh fitting to the wht vps can not be compared directly to @xmath104 and @xmath111 derived from the modeling discussed above : the latter ones correspond to the true moments of first and second order of the vps , whereas the former ones correspond to the best - fitting gaussian .",
    "we therefore recalculated the vp from @xmath18 , @xmath7 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , from which we then estimate the first and second order moments for direct comparison with the jeans models .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : jeansmod ] , where we plot @xmath104 , @xmath114 and @xmath111 of the vps along the major axis for both the wht and the fos data .",
    "also plotted are predictions for four models , that only differ in the mass of the central bh ( 0 , 3 , 5 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "all models have @xmath73 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( i.e. , all models are fully isotropic ) . for this value of @xmath96 , we obtain the best fit to the observed velocity dispersion outside @xmath118 .",
    "however , @xmath104 is not very well fitted : the wiggles in the rotation curve are not reproduced by the model .",
    "one can alter @xmath96 , as function of radius , such that we fit these wiggles , but at the cost of introducing them in the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "this is due to the poor fit of the jeans models to the rms velocities ( see lower - left panel of figure  [ fig : jeansmod ] ) .",
    "@xmath105 depends only on the sum of @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( see equation  [ [ vrmseq ] ] ) and is therefore independent of @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , the jeans models can not simultaneously fit @xmath104 and @xmath111 along the major axis .",
    "this suggests that the assumption made , i.e. , @xmath121 , is wrong , and that three - integral models are required .",
    "the jeans models without a central bh clearly underpredict the central velocity dispersion ( for both the wht and the fos measurements ) , as well as the central rotation gradient measured with the fos .",
    "models with a massive bh provide a much better fit .",
    "the actual mass of the bh depends on the data set used to constrain the model : the wht data suggests a bh mass of @xmath122 , whereas the fos data are best fitted with @xmath123 .",
    "so although the two - integral jeans modeling can not fit all the observed kinematics , it does suggest that a bh of a few times @xmath124 may be present in the center of ngc  4342 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : jeanscorr ] we plot the ratio of the observed rotation velocity over the rotation velocity of the best - fitting isotropic jeans model , @xmath125 ( along the major axis ) , versus the local observed ellipticity ( in @xmath19-band ) of ngc  4342 .",
    "there is a clear correlation in the sense that the jeans models underpredict the rotation velocity in the strongly flattened region , and overpredict @xmath104 in the less flattened region .",
    "the ellipticity is a measure of the local disk - to - bulge ratio , and this therefore suggests that disk and bulge have different velocity anisotropies . since @xmath104 scales with @xmath126 , another possibility may be that the disk and bulge are made up of different stellar populations ( whose mass - to - light ratios are different by almost a factor two ) .",
    "however , the separate components ( bulge , nuclear disk and outer disk ) do not stand out as separate entities in either the @xmath127 or the @xmath128 color images ( see bjm98 ) , rendering this explanation improbable .",
    "in order to investigate the presence of a @xmath129@xmath130 bh as suggested by the jeans models , we now construct fully general , axisymmetric models of ngc  4342 .",
    "we use an extension of schwarzschild s ( 1979 ) orbit - superposition method ( see de zeeuw 1997 ) , developed by rix et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter r97 ) and cretton et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter c98 ) .",
    "the main method , but for spherical systems , is outlined in r97 .",
    "the application to axisymmetric systems is discussed in c98 . here",
    "we briefly outline the method , and we refer the interested reader to r97 and c98 for details and tests of this modeling technique .      the first step of the method is to integrate orbits in the combined potential @xmath131 . each orbit is then projected onto the space of observables , taking convolution with the psf and pixel binning into account .",
    "finally , a non - negative least - squares algorithm is used to determine the distribution of orbit weights that best fits the observational data ( taking the observational errors into account ) , while also reproducing the luminous density distribution of the model .    throughout",
    "we limit ourselves to models with an inclination angle @xmath132 , and we assume that the stellar population has a constant mass - to - light ratio . therefore ,",
    "each model is characterized by only two free parameters : the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath133 , and the mass of the black hole , @xmath134 .",
    "our aim is to find the set @xmath135 that best fits the available constraints ( surface brightness and velocity profiles ) .",
    "the motion of a star in an axisymmetric potential , for which @xmath136 and @xmath137 are conserved , can be reduced to motion in the meridional @xmath87-plane , in the effective potential @xmath138 .",
    "the orbit is constrained within a region bounded by the zero velocity curve ( zvc ) defined through @xmath139 .",
    "each orbit in an axisymmetric potential @xmath86 admits two integrals of motion : energy @xmath140 and vertical angular momentum @xmath137 .",
    "regular orbits admit one additional integral , @xmath141 , which in general is not known analytically . such an orbit is confined to a sub - space inside the zvc .",
    "we only found a very small fraction of our orbit catalog to be irregular .",
    "the orbit library has to be set up such that one properly samples the full extent of phase space .",
    "the sampling has to be sufficiently dense to suppress discreteness noise , but is limited by the amount of available cpu time . after some testing we have chosen to calculate orbits on a @xmath142 @xmath143-grid .",
    "each energy is uniquely defined by a circular radius @xmath144 according to @xmath145 the 20 energies are sampled logarithmically between @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",

    "the mass inside @xmath148 is only a fraction of @xmath149 of the total mass , whereas a fraction of @xmath150 of the mass is located outside @xmath151 . for each energy , we calculate the maximum vertical angular momentum @xmath152 which corresponds to the circular orbit with energy @xmath136 , and sample @xmath153 on a linear grid of 10 values between 0.01 and 0.99 . hence , the purely circular and radial orbits are presumed to be represented by their closest neighbors on the grid , but are not explicitly calculated . at each value of @xmath154 , only the orbit with positive angular momentum has to be integrated , since its counterpart ( @xmath155 ) is simply a mirror reflection around zero velocity . since the third integral @xmath141 can generally not be expressed explicitly in terms of the phase - space coordinates , we use the method suggested by levison & richstone ( 1985 ) , and take the starting point on the zvc as a numerical representation of the third integral ( see also c98 ) .",
    "for that purpose we first calculate , for each @xmath156-pair , the locus @xmath157 on the zvc of the ` thin tube orbit ' . for a certain value of @xmath136 and @xmath158 ,",

    "each orbit is integrated for 200 radial periods , using linear interpolation between grid points to evaluate the potential and forces .",
    "on average , the energy conservation over 200 radial periods is better than one part in @xmath170 , justifying the interpolation scheme adopted . in total @xmath171 orbits",
    "are integrated , resulting in a library of @xmath172 orbits ( when doubling for the @xmath173 orbits ) .    during the integration of each orbit",
    "we project its phase - space coordinates onto the space of observables @xmath174 , where @xmath99 is the plane on the sky , and @xmath175 is the line - of - sight velocity . in the following we use @xmath31 as shorthand for @xmath175 .",
    "we adopt a three - dimensional grid in the @xmath176-space , i.e. , our storage cube , in which we record the fractional time the orbit spends in each of the cells ( see r97 for details ) .",
    "once the orbit integration is finished , we convolve each of the velocity slices @xmath99 with the psf appropriate for the observations .",
    "since we have kinematic constraints obtained with three different instrumental setups and different psfs ( wht major axis , wht minor axis , and fos apertures ) we use three separate @xmath176-storage cubes each of which is convolved with the respective psf .",
    "we use two cubes with @xmath177 @xmath99-cells for the wht major and minor axes .",
    "for the fos - cube , @xmath178 cells are used to comply with the higher spatial resolution of the hst . for all storage cubes",
    "we use 101 velocity bins of @xmath179 .",
    "the final step is to calculate the contribution of the orbit to each of the positions in the plane of the sky where we have photometric and/or kinematic constraints .",
    "these positions are in general extended areas ( e.g. , determined by the pixel size of the ccd , the slit width and the pixel rebinning used to obtain spectra of sufficient @xmath39 ) . for each constraint position",
    "@xmath180 we therefore sum the fractional times over the area of @xmath181 ( see r97 for details ) .",
    "this gives us in the end , for each orbit @xmath96 and each constraint position @xmath181 , the properly psf - convolved velocity profile ` histogram ' @xmath182 , integrated over the area of position @xmath181 . by using _",
    "times we ensure that each orbit is normalized to unity .",
    "the final step of the orbit - superposition method is to find the set of non - negative weights , @xmath183 , of each orbit that best matches the kinematic constraints and reproduces the luminous mass density of the model . since we normalize each orbit to unity , the orbital weights @xmath183 measure the fraction of the total light of the galaxy that resides on orbit @xmath96 .",
    "we use the following sets of constraints :    the solution @xmath184 has to reproduce the luminosity density @xmath185 ( equation  [ [ mgedens ] ] ) .",
    "we have subdivided the first quadrant of the meridional plane in @xmath186 @xmath187-cells , with @xmath109 and @xmath110 the standard spherical coordinates .",

    "@xmath96 we store the fractional time @xmath190 spent in cell @xmath191 .",
    "since we integrate the orbits in the meridional plane , this is similar to the fractional time the orbit spends in the three - dimensional volume obtained by integrating the area of the cell over @xmath192 radians in the @xmath193-direction .",
    "therefore we have computed the total luminosity , @xmath194 , of the mge model inside each volume @xmath191 .",
    "we will refer to these constraints as the `` self - consistency constraints '' .    from the wht spectra we obtained sets of @xmath195 at 19 positions @xmath181 along the major axis , and 8 along the minor axis .",
    "the quantities are the luminosity - weighted averages over the areas of constraint positions @xmath196 . for each of these 27 positions",
    "we have calculated the surface brightness @xmath197 integrated over that area , and convolved with the appropriate psf .",
    "the quantities @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 parameterize the velocity profiles @xmath202 with @xmath203 one can rewrite this parameterization in the form @xmath204 , with @xmath205 where @xmath206 , @xmath207 is again the standard gaussian ( see equation  [ [ alphaweq ] ] ) , and @xmath208 with @xmath198 and @xmath199 the measured rotation velocity and velocity dispersion of the vp s best - fitting gaussian at constraint position @xmath181 .",
    "note that with this definition , @xmath209 and @xmath210 are zero for all constraint positions .",
    "this parameterization has the advantage that the orbit - superposition problem for the orbit weights is linear ( see r97 ) .",
    "in addition , we obtained @xmath211 at 7 fos aperture - positions .",

    "in total we thus have 140 self - consistency constraints @xmath194 , 34 constraints on projected surface brightness @xmath197 , and 122 kinematic constraints @xmath216 .      at each constraint position",
    "@xmath181 we have a measured velocity profile @xmath202 , which we parameterized by @xmath217 . for each of the observational constraints",
    ", we have the measurement errors @xmath218 and @xmath219 from which we can calculate the errors @xmath220 .",
    "as described in section  5.2 we determined , for each orbit @xmath96 and each position @xmath181 , the velocity profile @xmath221 at velocity @xmath31 .",
    "we parameterize each orbital vp by @xmath222 with @xmath206 using equations  ( [ sleq ] ) and  ( [ newsleq ] ) and with @xmath223 replaced by @xmath182 , and by changing the integration to a summation over all velocity bins .",
    "the orbit weights @xmath183 ( @xmath224 ) that result in the best fit to the observations can be determined by minimizing @xmath225 in addition to minimizing @xmath226 , we also want the solution to match the luminosity density in the meridional plane , i.e. , we also want to minimize @xmath227 where @xmath228 sets the accuracy for reproducing the luminosity density in the meridional plane . throughout , we set @xmath229 and @xmath230 , such that we aim for an accuracy of one per cent in reproducing both the projected psf - convolved surface brightness and the luminosity density in the meridional plane .",
    "it is in principle sufficient to fit only the luminous density in the meridional plane : the surface brightness should be fitted automatically .",
    "however , because of discretization this is in practice not necessarily so , and we thus include the surface brightness at the constraint positions @xmath181 as separate constraints .",
    "minimizing @xmath231 is a least - squares problem for a matrix equation ( see r97 for a detailed description of the matrices involved ) .",
    "it has to be solved under the physical constraint that @xmath232 .",
    "following pfenniger ( 1984 ) , r97 and c98 , we use the non - negative least squares ( nnls ) algorithm by lawson & hanson ( 1974 ) to solve for the orbit weights .",
    "the nnls matrix equation solved is numerically rather ` ill - conditioned ' giving rise to a distribution function with strong oscillatory behavior .",
    "such dfs are unphysical ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1967 ; spergel & hernquist 1992 ; merritt 1993 ) .",
    "smoothing in the solution space can be achieved via regularization ( e.g. , merritt 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "we follow the scheme used by zhao ( 1996 ) , which is based on a minimization , up to a certain degree , of the differences in weights between neighboring orbits .",
    "the technique is described in r97 , c98 , and van der marel et al .",
    "1998 , and we refer the interested reader to those papers for details .",
    "the extra regularization constraints result in a less good fit to the data .",
    "the amount of smoothing is set such that the regularized model is still compatible with the data in a statistical sense , i.e. , such that @xmath233 , with @xmath234 the value obtained without regularization . unless mentioned otherwise , we discuss results in which no regularization has been adopted .",
    "although the modeling technique outlined in the previous sections works well for dynamically hot galaxies ( e.g. m32 , see van der marel et al .",
    "1998 ) , some problems arise when trying to apply it to dynamically cold systems such as ngc  4342 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we do not include the zeroth - order moment @xmath235 in the fit .",
    "this quantity measures the normalization of the best - fitting gaussian to the normalized vp and is observationally inaccessible : it is directly proportional to the unknown difference in line strength between the galaxy spectrum and the template spectrum used to analyze .",
    "( in practice one uses the assumption @xmath236 to estimate the line strength from the observations . ) as we now show , excluding @xmath235 from the gh series and expanding the orbital vps around the observed vps up to fourth order only , can lead to artificial counter - rotation in models of cold systems .",
    "assume we have an observed velocity profile @xmath237 , at a certain position on the sky , that is perfectly gaussian .",
    "the gh moments @xmath238 with @xmath239 of such a @xmath237 will all be zero . in the method described above , we derive the orbital @xmath240 ( @xmath206 ) from equation  ( [ newsleq ] )",
    "in which the observed @xmath18 and @xmath7 enter in the weighting function @xmath241 . in the nnls algorithm we solve for the orbit weights by minimizing the difference between the gh moments of @xmath237 and @xmath242 . in principle , the differences between the @xmath243 and @xmath244 are minimized , but for simplicity we illustrate the problem with a one - orbit model .    in the ideal case , an orbit",
    "whose vp deviates more strongly from the observed vp will be assigned a smaller weight .",
    "however , this is not always the case with the vp parameterization described in section  5.3 . to illustrate this we calculated the gh moments @xmath238 ( @xmath245 ) of a gaussian expanded around another gaussian , both with the same dispersion @xmath7 . in figure",

    "@xmath249 the higher - order moments increase with increasing velocity - difference . for larger values of @xmath250",
    "they start to decrease again to reach approximately zero for @xmath251 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath235 equals unity when the vps are identical , and decreases monotonically for increasing @xmath252 .    in ngc  4342 , which is a dynamically cold system ,",
    "the major - axis kinematics reach @xmath253 at the outside ( see figure  [ fig : velsig ] ) .",
    "an orbital vp with approximately the same @xmath18 and @xmath7 as an observed vp with @xmath254 will have its @xmath255 and @xmath256 close to zero .",
    "consequently , it will likely be given a non - zero weight .",
    "the same orbit , but with opposite sense of rotation ( i.e. , with reversed vertical angular momentum ) , will also have @xmath255 and @xmath256 close to zero , since @xmath257 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath258 and @xmath173 orbits have the same @xmath259 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 and are therefore indistinguishable for the fitting algorithm .",
    "the @xmath258 and @xmath173 orbits have opposite values of @xmath112 , but if @xmath260 is small , the difference between the two orbits , in terms of the vp parameterization used , remains small .",
    "if it would have been possible to include @xmath235 in the fit , then the @xmath258 would have @xmath235 close to unity , and the @xmath173 orbit would have @xmath261 ( see figure  [ fig : gh ] ) : the two vps _ would _ have been easily distinguishable .",
    "in addition , if the observational data had been of sufficient @xmath39 to derive gh moments up to very high order , it would also have been possible to distinguish the vps of the @xmath258 and @xmath173 orbits . in practice",
    ", however , one requires unrealistic high @xmath39 spectra to be able to measure these moments .",
    "we can thus expect that our solutions will have significant amounts of counter - rotation at radii where @xmath262 .",
    "we indeed found solutions in which the reconstructed vps at large radii along the major axis have two peaks at positive and negative @xmath175 ( see section  7.1 ) .",
    "van der marel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) applied the same modeling technique to the dynamically hot system m32 , which has @xmath263 everywhere , and therefore did not encounter this problem .    to solve the problem outlined above",
    ", we use a ` modified approach ' in which we add some extra constraints to the models : we exclude counter - rotating orbits whose circular radius @xmath144 is larger than a limiting radius @xmath264 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath265 , since for larger radii @xmath266 ( see figure  [ fig : velsig ] ) and the vp parameterization used becomes poor in the light of the problem discussed above . as we show in section  7.1 , this solves the problem of the artificial counter - rotation at large radii along the major axis , but it has the disadvantage that our models are not fully general any more : we have imposed some a priori constraints on the amount of counter - rotating orbits in ngc  4342 . on the other hand",
    ", the actual observations do not reveal any counter rotation at large radii .",
    "critically , one may argue that the vp analysis of the spectra is not suitable to detect such counter rotation , since we do not go to sufficient high order in the gh expansion .",
    "we have therefore also analyzed our spectra with the unresolved gaussian decomposition ( ugd ) method ( kuijken & merrifield 1993 ) , which is not hampered by this limitation ( e.g. , merrifield & kuijken 1994 ) , and found good agreement with the results of the gh parameterization .",
    "this suggests that indeed ngc  4342 has a negligible amount of counter - rotating stars in its outer disk . the additional constraint imposed on the models ,",
    "when using the modified approach , is thus justified observationally .",
    "based on the bh mass and mass - to - light ratio suggested by the jeans modeling ( section  4.1 ) we construct three - integral models with @xmath267 in the range @xmath268 and @xmath269 . for each value of @xmath270 only one orbit - library",
    "has to be constructed : a change in mass - to - light ratio is equivalent to a scaling of the model velocities proportional to @xmath126 . we therefore calculate 10 different orbit libraries , all with @xmath271 , that differ only in the mass of the central bh . if one scales to another value of @xmath133 , the mass of the bh changes accordingly to @xmath272 .",

    "plot @xmath287 ( lower - left panel ) shows the resulting @xmath276-plot when all constraints , including the hst measurements are taken into account .",
    "these high spatial - resolution measurements allow us to rule out models without a bh at a confidence level better than @xmath2 per cent . finally , in plot @xmath284 ( lower - right panel ) we show the results when using the modified approach on the entire set of constraints .",
    "as can be seen , the exclusion of counter - rotating orbits with circular radii beyond @xmath288 puts some further limits on the allowed range of acceptable models , consequently contracting slightly the @xmath2 per cent confidence region .",
    "although the solutions we find with the standard approach can result in models with significant counter - rotation ( see section  6 ) , one can still meaningfully use the @xmath276 statistics to put confidence levels on @xmath134 and @xmath133 .",
    "the main requirement is that orbital vps and observed vps are parameterized in exactly the same way , which is the case .",
    "the counter rotation that we find is simply a consequence of our particular vp parameterization .",

    "all three models provide equally good fits to the projected surface brightness and the meridional luminosity density ( not plotted ) . the main difference between models",

    ".  panels @xmath283 and @xmath285 of figure  [ fig : chicont ] ) .    the large differences between the predictions of model  c at the outermost point along the major axis ( wht measurements ) and the actual observed values is due to the problem with the counter - rotation .",

    "however , for the larger radii , the vps of model c clearly reveal large amounts of counter rotation .",
    "the vp of the upper - right panel has such a large counter - rotating component , that the best - fitting gaussian no longer corresponds to the peak at positive velocities : it is very broad and centered around @xmath301 .",

    "although the dynamical evidence for the presence of a mdo of a few @xmath303 in ngc  4342 is compelling , it does not automatically imply evidence for a bh .",
    "alternatives to a point mass , such as a cluster of brown dwarfs or stellar remnants are not ruled out by the modeling presented above .",

    "we consider model b for which we replace the @xmath310 bh by a plummer potential with the same mass , but with different values of @xmath309 .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio is kept constant at 6.25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chieps ] shows the resulting @xmath276 as function of @xmath309 .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath311 ( model b ) , and the fit deteriorates with increasing scalelength of the plummer potential .",
    "the dotted line indicates the formal 99.73 per cent confidence level , and at this level of confidence we can rule out dark clusters with @xmath312 .",
    "this upper limit on the scale length of the plummer sphere corresponds to 5.1 pc at the assumed distance of 15 mpc , implying a central density of the cluster @xmath313 .",
    "we calculate the relaxation timescale @xmath314 , and the collision timescale @xmath305 in which we adopt the mass - radius relation for _ non - collapsed _",
    "objects used by goodman & lee ( 1989 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : lifetime ] we plot the characteristic timescales for core - collapse and collisional destruction of our dark cluster , as function of the mass @xmath315 of the cluster s constituents . as can be seen",
    ", the timescales for core collapse ( @xmath316 yr ) and evaporation ( @xmath317 ) for the inferred dark cluster in ngc  4342 exceed the hubble time for @xmath318 few @xmath319 , and neither of these processes thus allows us to rule out a dark cluster as an alternative to a bh .",
    "the collision timescale @xmath305 is the most restricting , and we are close to being able to rule out dark clusters of non - collapsed objects with masses less than @xmath320 . however , for clusters of brown dwarfs with masses of @xmath321 , @xmath305 is still of the order of @xmath322 yr , and such clusters can clearly not be ruled out by current observations .",
    "clusters of _ collapsed _ stellar remnants , such as white dwarfs or neutron stars , have collision timescales that are even much larger than the value of @xmath323 plotted in figure  [ fig : lifetime ] .",
    "this is due to the much smaller collisional cross - sections of these collapsed objects .",
    "in fact , the collapse time for a dark cluster can be made arbitrarily long by giving its objects an arbitrarily small mass , and the problems with collisions and mergers can be avoided by assuming the cluster to be a collisionless gas of elementary particles . however",
    ", another effect might allow one to rule out such a dark cluster : the trapping of stars by the cluster due to dynamical friction .",
    "if the time scale for this process is smaller than the age of the galaxy , enouh stars will get trapped such that the cluster can no longer be considered dark .",
    "alternatively , these trapped stars can merge and form a massive bh , thus spoiling the goal for which the cluster was introduced .",
    "the time scale for the trapping to occur is independent of the mass @xmath315 of the cluster constituents , but does depend on the mass @xmath324 of the stars being captured , and is given by @xmath325 ( as long as @xmath326 , see quinlan 1996 ) . for ngc  4342",
    "we thus find that this capture time scale is only smaller than @xmath327 yr for stars with @xmath328 .",
    "we can thus not use this trapping - mechanism to put an appreciable constraint on the nature of a possible dark cluster in ngc  4342 .    in conclusion",
    ", it is clear that we are still a long way from being able to rule out dark clusters as viable alternatives for a massive bh in the center of ngc  4342 .",
    "it has been argued that a bar observed end - on may mimic the presence of a bh ( gerhard 1988 ) .",
    "in particular , the nuclear disk in ngc  4342 may in fact be a ( very thin ) nuclear bar .",
    "however , there are several reasons why this interpretation is unlikely .",
    "first of all , axisymmetric models without bh fail to fit the central velocity dispersion , as measured with the hst / fos , by @xmath297 .",
    "it seems unlikely that the elongated orbits in a bar potential can fix this .",
    "furthermore , there are no indications that ( the center of ) ngc  4342 is triaxial .",
    "although van den bosch & emsellem ( 1998 ) have provided evidence that ngc  4570 , a galaxy with a double - disk morphology similar to ngc  4342 , has been shaped under the influence of a rapidly tumbling bar - potential , none of the characteristics found in ngc  4570 that led to this conclusion are apparent in ngc  4342 .",
    "in addition , no minor axis rotation is found , and the small amount of isophote twist observed ( see bjm98 ) is limited to the outer region of the galaxy , and is more likely to be associated with a small warping of the outer disk , probably induced by the small companion at @xmath14 se .",
    "finally , the steep cusp of the bulge of ngc  4342 makes the bar hypothesis unlikely , since the pressure support from this strongly cusped bulge probably assures stability against bar formation ( cf .",
    "van den bosch & de zeeuw 1996 ) .      during the orbit integrations we store , in addition to the fractional time spent by orbit @xmath96 in meridional cell @xmath191 , @xmath190",
    ", the time - weighted first and second order velocity moments averaged over cell @xmath191 . with the solution for the orbit weights",
    "@xmath35 we can compute the internal dynamical structure of the model averaged over each cell @xmath191 .",
    "these are given by @xmath329 and @xmath330 here we use the subscript @xmath283 to indicate either of the cylindrical coordinates @xmath159 , @xmath193 or @xmath331 .",
    "the cell - averaged velocity dispersions can be computed according to @xmath332 .    in order to suppress noise , we average @xmath333 and @xmath334 over cells @xmath191 that have the same radius @xmath109 but different @xmath110 ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 being the standard spherical coordinates ) . given the strongly flattened shape of ngc  4342 and its multi - component structure , we decided to split the galaxy in two parts : we determine the internal dynamical structure in two cones ; one with half - opening angle of @xmath335 centered around the equatorial plane , including the nuclear and outer disks , and the other one with half - opening angle of @xmath336 centered around the minor axis , representing the bulge of ngc  4342 .",
    "we investigate the dynamical structure of models a , b , and c using the modified approach ( see section  6.1 ) and regularization as described in section  5.5 in order to suppress noise . as a check",
    ", we compare the dynamical structures before and after regularization ( with the amount of smoothing chosen such that @xmath337 ) .",
    "the regularized model is found to have a smoother dynamical structure , but the main features are similar for both cases indicating that our results are not too sensitive to the particular method and amount of regularization adopted .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dynmaj ] we plot the dynamics in the ` equatorial cone ' as function of radius .",
    "the upper panels show the rms velocities for models a , b and c in the range between @xmath338 and @xmath339 ( corresponding to the regime where we have kinematic constraints along the major axis ) .",
    "the middle panels display the ratio @xmath340 for the same radial interval ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "since there is no streaming motion in the radial and vertical directions , @xmath342 and @xmath343 are equal to their respective rms velocities .",
    "the difference between @xmath344 and @xmath93 reflects the streaming motion of the model .",
    "the lower panels show the ratios @xmath345 and @xmath95 .",
    "the three models differ predominantly in the inner @xmath346 , reflecting the differences in bh mass , but are very similar outside of @xmath347 : clearly @xmath344 dominates the dynamics outside this radius in accordance with the rapid rotation of the outer disk .",
    "the rapid change in dynamical structure ( from azimuthally anisotropic to radially anisotropic ) going from @xmath348 to @xmath349 reflects the strong increase of @xmath350 over this radial interval ( see figure  [ fig : velsig ] ) : the dynamically cold outer disk , mainly built up of close - to - circular orbits with low @xmath93 , becomes the dominant mass component . over the same radial interval , the projected ellipticity increases from @xmath351 to @xmath352 , and",
    "this thus explains the observed correlation between ellipticity and @xmath125 of the best fitting isotropic jeans model plotted in figure  [ fig : jeanscorr ] . at @xmath353 , @xmath354 , not too different from the value in the solar neighborhood where @xmath355 ( dehnen 1998 ) .",
    "models b and c have @xmath356 remarkably constant at @xmath357 , and are thus not too different from two - integral models ( for which this ratio is exactly 1.0 ) .",
    "this is very different from the case without bh ( model a ) for which @xmath356 is a strong function of radius @xmath159 .",
    "this is the reason that the two - integral , isotropic jeans model discussed in section  4 , could not fit the hst rotation velocities without bh , whereas model a can .",
    "the main change going from model  a to model  c , is a strong increase of @xmath95 in the inner @xmath358 . in these inner regions",
    "the circular velocities increase strongly with increasing bh mass .",
    "nevertheless , all three models provide an almost equally good fit to the observed rotation velocities .",
    "we checked our solutions and found that going from model a to c , the ratio of @xmath173-orbits over @xmath258-orbits increases in the radial interval @xmath359 .",
    "this causes the net streaming motions of all three models to be roughly similar despite the large differences in circular velocities .",
    "furthermore , it explains the strong increase in @xmath93 observed when going from model  a to model  c.    the dynamics of the bulge ( represented by the cone with half - opening angle of @xmath336 centered around the minor axis ) is presented in figure  [ fig : dynmin ] .",
    "we only plot the results out to @xmath360 , corresponding to the radial interval where we have kinematic constraints along the minor axis .",
    "at @xmath361 the models are again similar , being dominated by rotation , albeit to a much lesser extent than along the major axis .",
    "model  a is radially anisotropic in the central region ( @xmath362 ) , and @xmath363 decreases steadily with bh mass going from model  a to model  c. the radial anisotropy of the central region of the bulge of model  a is required to fit the high central velocity dispersions observed as good as possible .",
    "close to the equatorial plane , the steep rotation curve observed prevents model  a from being too radially anisotropic ( see also section  7.4 ) .",
    "model  b is again remarkably close to two - integral form , having @xmath364 .",
    "we now investigate to what extent radial anisotropy can influence the central kinematics of ngc  4342 .",
    "we solve the orbit weights for the model with @xmath365 and @xmath366 using two different sets of constraints .",
    "the first one uses all constraints except the _ rotation velocities _ measured with the fos .",
    "the second one excludes only the fos _ velocity dispersions _ from the constraints .",
    "the results for both models are shown in figure  [ fig : radial ] , where we plot the predictions for the rotation velocities and velocity dispersions of both models .",
    "we only plot the predictions for the fos kinematics : both models have almost indistinguishable wht kinematics .",
    "the lower two panels in figure  [ fig : radial ] show the dynamics of the resulting models ; we plot both @xmath367 and @xmath368 as function of radius .",
    "these quantities are averaged between @xmath369 and @xmath370 .    the model with the fos rotation velocities excluded from the constraints ( solid lines ) reveals the highest central velocity dispersion achievable without a bh , while still fitting the wht measurements .",
    "the model predicts a central rotation curve that is too shallow to fit the observed rotation velocities , and is strongly radially anisotropic in the center .",
    "the model excluding the fos velocity dispersions ( dashed lines ) shows a very steep central rotation curve .",
    "the model is strongly azimuthally anisotropic in the center , resulting in a much smaller central velocity dispersion .",
    "clearly , a model without a central bh can not simultaneously fit the rotation velocities and velocity dispersions measured with the fos .",
    "the best - fitting mass - to - light ratio of @xmath371 is unusually large for the stellar population of an early - type galaxy ( e.g. , van der marel 1991 ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is mainly set by the large rotation velocities measured at the outside of ngc  4342 ( along the major axis ) .",
    "the large value found may indicate that ngc  4342 is embedded in a massive dark halo .",
    "we did not attempt to include such a component for two reasons : first , we are mainly interested in trying to fit the central kinematics and to examine the mass of a possible bh",
    ". the characteristics of a possible dark halo will not affect the central dynamics , and therefore will not alter our main conclusion that ngc  4342 harbors a massive bh .",
    "it may however result in a different dynamical structure of the outer bulge and disk . secondly",
    ", since we can fit all kinematics without having to infer a dark halo , including such a component in the models will merely lead to a large range of different models that can fit the observed kinematics equally well .",
    "only kinematics at much larger radii can constrain the presence and characteristics of such a possible dark halo ( cf .",
    "r97 ) .    since mass - to - light ratio scales with distance",
    "@xmath284 as @xmath372 , another explanation for the large value of @xmath133 derived might be an underestimate of the distance . in order to bring",
    "the inferred mass - to - light ratio in accordance with the average value for early - type galaxies , ngc  4342 has to be at about twice the assumed distance of 15 mpc .",
    "this is however hard to reconcile with the observed heliocentric velocity of ngc  4342 of only @xmath373 ( de vaucouleurs et al .  1976 ) .",
    "galaxies out to 15 mpc from the center of the virgo cluster can still experience a virgocentric infall of a few hundred @xmath374 : our local group falls towards virgo with @xmath375 ( tammann & sandage 1985 ) .",
    "a distance of 30 mpc for ngc  4342 , however , would imply a virgocentric infall velocity of @xmath376 ( where we have taken virgo to be at @xmath377 ) , which seems too large .",
    "so , the small recession velocity of ngc  4342 implies that it can not be too far behind virgo such as to have an appreciable effect on the inferred mass - to - light ratio .",
    "another problem related to the outer density distribution is that the mass model used ( the mge model ) falls off as @xmath378 at large radii .",
    "this is probably not correct , but since we only have photometry that is limited to a small radial extent , we can not examine this in more detail .",
    "the main requirement is that we have a proper mass model for the major part of the galaxy .",
    "our mge model has a total luminosity of @xmath379 .",
    "we have shown in section  3 , that for this luminosity we derive @xmath380 , in good agreement with the average value for early - type galaxies .",
    "this therefore suggests that our mge model covers the major part of the galaxy , and that the galaxy does not extend far beyond the radial extent of our mge model .",
    "in addition , as is the case with a dark halo , a change in the luminosity density profile in the outer parts of ngc  4342 will not affect our main conclusions regarding the presence of a central bh .",
    "there are now about a dozen bh candidates known .",
    "the best cases are the center of the mw , where a proper - motion study has revealed a @xmath381 bh ( eckart & genzel 1997 ) , and ngc  4258 , where water masers are found to be in keplerian rotation around a @xmath382 bh ( miyoshi et al .",
    "other strong evidence for the existence of massive bhs comes from the observation of the fe k@xmath207 line at 6.4 kev in a number of seyfert 1 nuclei : the x - ray emission line exhibits relativistic motions , interpreted as arising from the accretion disk surrounding a massive bh ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "most other bh detections ( or confirmations ) are based on observations with the hst .",
    "observations of nuclear gas disks with the hst has provided strong cases for massive bhs in m84 , m87 , ngc  4261 , ngc  6251 , and ngc  7052 .",
    "all other cases are based on stellar dynamical evidence : m31 , m32 , ngc  3115 , ngc  3377 , ngc  3379 , and ngc4486b . of these only m  32 ,",
    "ngc  3379 and ngc  4342 discussed here have been confronted with three - integral modeling thus far . as discussed in section  1",
    ", one can only hope to properly detect a bh if one can observe its kinematics inside @xmath383 .",
    "all currently detected bhs have @xmath384 , and since all these galaxies , except the nucleus of the milky way , have now been observed with the hst , all current bh - candidates fulfill this requirement .",
    "remarkable enough , most of these galaxies ( m31 , m32 , m87 , ngc  3115 , and ngc  4594 ) were already considered bh candidates when the angular resolution of the observations was still an order of magnitude larger , and similar to the angular size of the radius of influence of the inferred bh ( rix 1993 ) .",
    "the bh in ngc  4342 has a relatively small radius of influence , with an angular size of @xmath385 .",
    "indeed we have shown that only the hst / fos observations are of sufficient spatial resolution to rule out models without a central bh .",
    "kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) have suggested a relation between the mass of the bh and that of the bulge of its parent galaxy : @xmath386 . for more recent discussions on this relation , including more recent bh detections see kormendy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , ho ( 1998 ) , van der marel ( 1998 ) , and van der marel & van den bosch ( 1998 ) .",
    "ngc  4342 is the galaxy with currently the second - highest ratio of bh mass over bulge mass of @xmath387 , and is only superseded by the peculiar galaxy ngc  4486b , for which the case of a massive bh is less strong ( kormendy et al .",
    "ngc  3115 ( @xmath388 ) and the milky way ( @xmath389 ) are other clear deviants .",
    "clearly , the scatter around the suggested relation is considerable , seemingly as large as nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "spectra obtained with the wht and hst / fos of the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc  4342 have revealed a very steep central rotation curve and a strong central increase in velocity dispersion .",
    "these data suggest a large central mass concentration . in this paper we presented detailed dynamical models of ngc  4342 used to investigate whether its nucleus harbors a massive bh .",
    "we model the luminous density distribution of ngc  4342 with multiple gaussian components . after projection and psf convolution",
    "this model provides an excellent fit to the hst @xmath19-band surface brightness distribution .",
    "the parameters of this model were derived with the mge method .",
    "simple isotropic jeans models suggest that ngc  4342 harbors a massive bh of a few times @xmath303 .",
    "the actual mass of the bh depends on the data - set fitted : the wht data suggest @xmath390 ; the hst / fos data suggest a somewhat larger bh mass of @xmath391 .",
    "this discrepancy already suggests that the assumptions underlying the jeans models , i.e. , @xmath121 and therefore @xmath80 , are incorrect .",
    "this is also evident from the fact that the jeans models can not accurately fit the major - axis rms velocities measured with the wht .",
    "these rms velocities are independent of the freedom in the anisotropy @xmath392 allowed in the jeans modeling .",
    "we find that for a mass - to - light ratio @xmath393 and an isotropic velocity distribution ( @xmath394 ) the jeans model with @xmath395 provides the best fit to the observed wht velocity dispersions along the major axis .",
    "however , the rotation velocities are not very well fitted and we find a correlation between @xmath396 and the local ellipticity of the projected surface brightness , such that the model underpredicts the rotation velocities in the highly flattened regions ( dominated by the disk light ) and overpredicts them in the less flattened region ( dominated by the bulge light ) .",
    "this suggests that the different components in ngc  4342 have different velocity anisotropies .",
    "we thus constructed three - integral axisymmetric models of ngc  4342 in order to examine the mass of a possible bh and the dynamical structure of the different components .",
    "the modeling technique is an extension of schwarzschild s orbit - superposition technique , and is based on finding the ensemble of orbits that best fits the observations .",
    "these models make no assumption about the dynamical structure and are fully general .",
    "this technique , developed by rix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and cretton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , has previously been used to prove the existence of a massive bh of @xmath295 in the compact elliptical m32 ( van der marel et al .",
    "we have constructed a range of dynamical ( @xmath397)-models of ngc  4342 to determine a central bh mass of @xmath3 and an @xmath19-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath398 .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the hst / fos data allow us to rule out models without a bh to a confidence level better than @xmath2 per cent . with a similar confidence we can rule out models with a bh more massive than @xmath399 .",
    "this upper limit on the bh mass is mainly due to the vp shape parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 . with the current data we can not rule out alternatives to a massive bh , such as a cluster of brown dwarfs or stellar remnants",
    "nevertheless , the qso paradigm , together with the fact that the presence of massive bhs in galactic nuclei has unambiguously been demonstrated in a few galaxies were the inferred central densities are high enough to rule out dark clusters as alternatives ( see discussion in maoz 1997 ) , make the interpretation of the inferred mdo in ngc  4342 in terms of a massive bh the most likely .",
    "we computed the intrinsic mean velocities and velocity dispersions of the three - integral models .",
    "the dynamical structures of the best fitting models vary strongly with radius , reflecting the multi - component structure of ngc  4342 . between @xmath400 and @xmath349 in the equatorial plane the best fitting models change from azimuthally anisotropic to radially",
    "anisotropic , while @xmath401 .",
    "this explains the correlation between the projected ellipticity and the failure of the isotropic jeans models to fit the observed rotation velocities along the major axis .",
    "the bulge in the best fitting model without bh is radially anisotropic .",
    "however , we have shown that even without the constraints of the measured hst / fos rotation velocities , models without bh can not fit the central hst / fos velocity dispersion .",
    "the rotation velocities measured from the ground already constrain the amount of central radial anisotropy such that models without a bh can not fit the high central velocity dispersion measured with the hst / fos .",
    "the bh mass thus derived contributes a fraction of @xmath402 per cent to the total mass of the bulge ( @xmath403 ) . with this bh mass ,",
    "ngc  4342 has one of the highest ratios of bh mass over bulge mass .",
    "currently , the bh in our own galaxy has , with @xmath404 per cent , the lowest bh mass to bulge mass ratio known : the scatter in the @xmath134 vs. @xmath405 relation seems to be as large as two orders of magnitude .",
    "extremely high spatial resolution is required in order to investigate if other galaxies have even lower values of @xmath406 . in conclusion ,",
    "current data are consistent with a relation between bulge mass and bh mass , but the scatter is very large , and it is likely that the current @xmath407 ratios found are biased towards an upper limit . although the newly installed space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) is likely to detect many more bh cases in the coming years , detection of bhs with masses of the order of a @xmath404 per cent of the bulge mass or less in galaxies in virgo or beyond , will probably have to await a next generation space telescope .",
