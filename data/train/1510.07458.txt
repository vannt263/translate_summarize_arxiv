    "in the past few decades , the number of detected extrasolar planets around other main sequence stars has increased dramatically , so that at the time of writing , more than 1000 confirmed planets have been discovered among which @xmath1 have an observed measure of the angle between their orbital plane and the equatorial plane of their host star ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "well studied planet formation scenarios such as core accretion @xcite or disc fragmentation @xcite involve the planet forming in a disc with the natural expectation that the orbit should be coplanar .",
    "however , rossiter mclaughlin measurements of close orbiting hot jupiters indicate that around @xmath2 have angular momentum vectors significantly misaligned with the angular velocity vector of the central star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , new techniques have also been applied on the detection of the misalignment angles such as a technique involving asteroseismology ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or star - spot measurements @xcite .",
    "although firstly discovered in systems involving single hot jupiters , new observations indicate that significant misalignments can also occur in multi - planetary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as the stellar and disc angular velocities are naturally expected to be aligned , the observational results would imply an inclination of the planetary orbits relative to the nascent protoplanetary disc .",
    "this has been underlined by several recent studies of the interactions of planets with a range of initial orbital inclinations with respect to a disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these works the evolution of planets with masses up to a maximum of @xmath3 with different initial eccentricities and relatively small initial inclinations up to a maximum of @xmath4 interacting with three - dimensional isothermal and radiative discs",
    "are considered .",
    "they showed damping for both eccentricity and inclination with the planets circularising in the disc after a few hundred orbits .",
    "planets with higher inclinations have also been studied by e.g. @xcite and @xcite . a detailed survey of a range of planet masses and the full range of orbital inclinations interacting with a disc has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the timescale of realignment with the gas disc was found to be comparable with the disc lifetime for very high inclinations @xmath5 and planet masses of one jupiter mass . for smaller initial relative inclinations and/or larger planet masses ,",
    "the timescale for realignment is shorter than the disc lifetime .",
    "these results taken together imply that there is a need for an explanation for the origin of misaligned giant planets , if it is assumed that the discs angular momentum vector is always aligned with the spin axis of the central star .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of misalignments between the planetary orbital angular momentum vector and the stellar rotation axis as well as produce close in giant planets .",
    "the first involves excitation of very high eccentricities , either through the lidov - kozai effect induced by the interaction with a distant companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or through planet - planet scattering or chaotic interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the planet attains a small enough pericentre distance , this is then followed by orbital circularization due to tidal interaction with the central star , leaving the planet on a close inclined circular orbit .",
    "a method for producing high orbital inclinations with respect to the stellar equator has also been indicated by @xcite , who have studied the evolution of two giant planets in resonance , adopting an approximate analytical expression for the influence of a gas disc in producing orbital migration .",
    "their calculations suggest that resonant inclination excitation can occur when the eccentricity of the inner planet reaches a threshold value @xmath6 .",
    "inclinations gained by the resonant pair of planets can reach values up to @xmath7 .",
    "however in a recent study , @xcite find that large eccentricities , that are expected to be associated with such interactions for orbits too wide to be affected by stellar tides , are seen mostly in metal rich systems .",
    "accordingly they conclude that gentle disc migration and planet - planet scattering must both operate during the early evolution of giant planets . only systems packed with giant planets , which most easily form around metal rich stars , can produce large eccentricities through scattering .",
    "they also note a lack of a correlation between spin - orbit misalignment and metallicity that may indicate the operation of such a mechanism .",
    "an explanation for the origin of misaligned planets , that is consistent with formation in and inward migration driven by a disc may be connected with the possibility that the orientation of the disc changes , possibly due either to a lack of orbital alignment of the source material or to gravitational encounters with passing stars .",
    "this may occur either before or after planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that the capture of gas from accretion envelopes by a protoplanetary disc could cause it to become significantly misaligned with respect to its original plane .",
    "it is of interest to remark that misaligned gas discs can easily be produced when interactions with the environment out of which they form are considered .",
    "however , this result has been questioned recently by @xcite who studied the 3d evolution of circumstellar discs during stellar flybys including mass transfer between the two gas discs around the stars . in their simulations ,",
    "disc inclinations of @xmath8 were only generated .",
    "the effects of single close encounters on circumstellar discs can be very strong as the perturbing star can destroy the global structure and dynamics of a disc .",
    "these gravitational effects of a close stellar encounter on a circumstellar disc have been studied analytically as well as numerically by many groups in the past years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . for different perturber orbits",
    ", these studies have mainly concentrated on equal - mass stars , disc mass loss and disc sizes .",
    "@xcite studied the eccentricity and inclination changes of test particles for inclined perturber orbits through orbital integration and analytical calculations .",
    "though , the viscosity as well as self - gravity of the disc have not been taken into account making the results only partly applicable to realistic protoplanetary discs",
    ". one major lack of above studies is the assumption of equal - mass stars . in this regard",
    "we note that in general , protostars are not formed in isolation , but are bound in stellar clusters where gravitational interactions are common . in stellar clusters",
    ", there is a global function describing the distribution of the stellar masses - the initial mass function ( imf ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . taking into account the mass distribution in a stellar cluster",
    ", it can be very common that close encounters occur for different mass stars .",
    "so far , many studies of protoplanetary discs and planetary systems affected by single stellar flybys have investigated a parameter range spanning the entire imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several groups have performed n - body simulations of stellar clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in order to study rates and properties of close encounters and their influences on disc sizes and mass loss , but also on planetary systems .    the numerous , though fragmentary studies so far make it very difficult to predict the three - dimensional evolution of planets and their interaction with their host discs . in answering the question concerning the evolution of a circumstellar disc",
    ", one could make a major step in the discussions about the formation of misaligned hot jupiters .    in view of the above discussion about misaligned planets ,",
    "it is important to investigate the evolution of a protoplanetary disc experiencing gravitational perturbations of a stellar flyby event as previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that a gaseous circumstellar disc is able to control the evolution of the whole disc - planet system . in this paper , we study the three - dimensional evolution of a viscous protoplanetary disc which is perturbed by a passing star .",
    "the aim is to answer the question whether single stellar flybys are capable to generate significant total disc inclinations .",
    "furthermore , by surveying the parameter space of stellar close encounters we aim to find specific parameter domains which allow inclination generation of the disc .",
    "we make the simplification of neglecting the disc self - gravity which results in a significant reduction in computational resource requirements .",
    "this is mainly motivated by the fact that disc masses are usually very small compared to the central stellar mass .    in studying the disc inclination , we note that warping of protoplanetary discs can generally occur as a result of tidal interaction with a binary star or if the disc accretes matter with angular momentum misaligned with that of the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for stellar perturbers on parabolic orbits ,",
    "the extent of warping for different orbital parameters is still an open question due to lack of three dimensional studies .",
    "however the potential warping of a protoplanetary disc is relevant in the discussion of planets since it has direct consequences on the formation and three - dimensional evolution of planets in these systems ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown that smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations are capable of being applied to the problem of three - dimensional evolutions of gaseous discs rather than grid - based simulation methods .",
    "in contrast to grid - based methods , as they adopt a lagrangian approach , sph simulations can be readily used to simulate a gas disc with a free boundary that undergoes a large amount of movement in three dimensions with the disc having the freedom to change its shape at will . as it is suitable for the system that we aim to study ,",
    "we adopt this approach here . in section [ sec : sim_details ] , we describe our simulation technique , giving details of the equation of state ( eos ) , the smoothing length and artificial viscosity . in section [ sec : ic ] , we describe the general setup for the disc and the central star . for a better understanding of the results ,",
    "we discuss the properties of realistic close encounters in more detail in section [ sec : orbit ] .",
    "we go on to present the simulation results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we have performed simulations using a modified version of the publicly available code gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "gadget-2 is a hybrid n - body / sph code capable of modelling both fluid and distinct fixed or orbiting massive bodies . in our case the central star , of mass @xmath9 is fixed while the stellar perturber , of mass @xmath10 moves as a massive body .",
    "we adopt spherical polar coordinates @xmath11 with origin at the centre of mass of the central star .",
    "the associated cartesian coordinates @xmath12 are such that the @xmath13 plane coincides with the initial midplane of the disc .    the gaseous disc is represented by gasesous ( sph ) particles .",
    "an important issue for n - body / sph simulations is the choice of the gravitational softening lengths .",
    "the only gravitational softening that is included in our simulation is for the gravitational interaction between the sph particles and the two stellar particles .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath16 contributions from the central star and the stellar perturber of mass , @xmath17 with position @xmath18 , are included . because the origin of the coordinate system moves with the central star ,",
    "the well known indirect terms accounting for the acceleration of the coordinate system are present in equation ( [ eq : pot ] ) .    for the computation of the gravitational interaction between the massive bodies and the gas particles , the potential was softened following the method of @xcite .",
    "this was implemented with fixed softening lengths @xmath19 internal length units for both the central star and the stellar perturber .",
    "the disc s self - gravity was neglected .",
    "the stars are allowed to accrete gas particles that approach them very closely .",
    "we followed the procedure of @xcite .",
    "this was applied such that for the stars , the outer accretion radius was fixed during the simulation to be @xmath20 internal length units .",

    "as the disc is perturbed by a star on an inclined orbit , its initial orientation can change significantly . in order to find the exact direction of the rotational velocity vector",

    ", we adopt @xmath30 . for previous studies with a binary companion on an orbit inclined to the disc",
    ", it was found that for high initial inclinations @xmath31 , expansion of the outer regions of the disc could result in a small number of particles being induced to interact strongly with the companion . in order to avoid numerical problems arising from this , we adopted the following procedure .",

    "in addition , we include an routine to allow gas particles that become bound to the perturber to have an appropriate hydrodynamical treatment . in these cases ,",
    "the hydrodynamical parameters are computed by taking the distance of a gas particle to the perturber instead of its distance to the primary star .",
    "we found that the application of this procedure did not affect the global outcomes of the simulations .      for our sph calculations ,",
    "the smoothing length was adjusted so that the number of nearest neighbours to any particle contained within a sphere of radius equal to the local smoothing length was @xmath37 .",

    "a detailed discussion of our applied @xmath40 parameter can be found in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the artificial viscosity is modified by the application of a viscosity - limiter to reduce artificially induced angular momentum transport in the presence of shear flows .",
    "this is especially important for the study of keplerian discs .",
    "details are given in @xcite where we showed that runs with @xmath42 provided the best match to the analytic ring spreading solution with the @xcite viscosity parameter @xmath43 but note that this correlation with @xmath44 is only valid for keplerian thin discs without significant vertical expansion of the disc .",
    "we study a system composed of a central star of one solar mass @xmath45 , a gaseous disc surrounding the central star and a stellar perturber of mass @xmath10 .",
    "the disc is set up such that the angular momentum vector for all particles was in the same direction enabling a midplane for the disc to be defined .",
    "the primary central star is fixed at the origin of our coordinate system while the perturber follows a parabolic orbit about the primary central star .",
    "the gravitational effect of the disc on the perturber s orbit is neglected . in order to avoid transients arising from an abrupt introduction of the perturbing star",
    ", we allow its mass to increase linearly to @xmath10 during the first 5 internal time units , with the internal time unit being the orbital period at @xmath46 .",
    "corresponding to this , the internal unit of length is taken to be @xmath47 .",
    "these units of length and time are adopted for all plots shown in this paper . but note that for given sufficient resolution in the disc , our results can be generalized to larger disc radii since the problem studied here is scale - invariant . as we will discuss in the next section",

    "are modified by the softening of the potential due to the central star .",
    "the number of gas particles for most of our simulations was taken to be 2@xmath63 this enabled a large suite of simulations to be carried out .",
    "simulations were stopped when the disc inclinations and disc masses became constant after the stellar encounter .",
    "some of our simulations were also run with @xmath64 particles in order to test the effect of changing particle number .",
    "no significant changes occured .    in this paper",
    ", we will mainly concentrate on the evolution of a viscous gaseous disc which experiences a single stellar flyby .",
    "due to numerical reasons in the hydrodynamical simulations , the long - term evolution of the disc can not be followed accurately as we will discuss in section [ sec : longterm ] . for comparison ,",
    "we have also performed a set of simulations with a disc composed of collisionless particles with a purely n - body treatment .",
    "although the specific choice of simulation parameters relating to the initial disc and the perturber s orbit were chosen largely for numerical convenience , we point out that the results can be extended to apply to other configurations .    in the system that we aim to study , we are able to apply the usual scaling of lengths and times that leave gravitationally interacting systems invariant . more precisely , the numerical outcome is expected to scale with the ratio of the pericenter to the disc s outer radius . for systems with different disc s radii ,",
    "the results are identical as long as the pericenter is chosen such that its ratio to the disc s radius is unchanged and if the time is scaled accordingly .    in our study",
    ", the outcome is expected to depend on the stellar mass ratio .",
    "however , we do not expect a simple dependency of the final disc properties such as disc inclination on the mass ratio . this is",
    "because the disc is allowed to lose mass to the perturber and thus the number of disc particles that contribute to the disc properties can differ significantly between distinct simulation models .    beside the stellar mass ratio ,",
    "the possible effect of different three - dimensional orientations of the perturber s orbit on the final disc properties is a major issue that has not been studied yet and thus has to be investigated . in section [ sec:3dorbit ] , we will elaborately discuss the characterization of the orbit in our simulations .      in stellar clusters ,",
    "stellar masses follow a global distribution function which is called the initial mass function ( imf ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking into account the imf in a stellar cluster , it can be very common that close encounters occur for different mass stars .",
    "several numerical surveys have been performed to study the frequency of close encounters in different cluster types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied the encounter history and characteristics of different stellar clusters . in their work , they determined the probability of close encounters with the help of n - body simulations .",
    "for example , figure 6 of @xcite shows the probability distribution of close encounters for different perturber masses influencing solar - like stars . at @xmath65 ,",
    "the probability distribution shows two local maxima , one for low - mass perturbers and another one for massive perturbers with masses considerably higher than 1 @xmath66 .",
    "as we are interested in close encounters with perturber masses @xmath67 , it is important to determine the probability of a solar type star to have an encounter with a perturber with at least 5 @xmath66 in order to confirm the likelihood of such a scenario .",
    "this required probability is the sum over all probabilities in the range [ 5 : * ] @xmath66 in figure 6 of @xcite .",
    "given the numerical results for @xmath65 , we determined the probability for a solar - like star to have had at least one encounter with a perturber with at least @xmath68 between 100 au and 1000 au to be roughly 1/4 .",
    "thus , every fourth solar - like star is expected to have had at least one encounter with a massive perturber during the first 2.8 myr of its lifetime .",
    "as our results are length invariant , this relatively high propability also applies to our simuliations with smaller disc sizes .",
    "so far , numerical cluster simulations have not studied the likelihood of different three - dimensional orientations of the perturber s orbit relative to the initial disc plane making it difficult for us to make predictions of the probability of a stellar flyby with a specific orientation .    for this reason , we assume that the relative orientation between a perturber s orbit and a disc in a stellar cluster is randomn .",
    "hence , we could assume that prograde and retrograde orbits are equiprobable . applying this assumption ,",
    "the probability of a solar - like star to have at least one close encounter on a retrograde orbit is expected to be @xmath69 0.125 .    given this relatively high probability of close encounters between massive stars on retrograde orbits and solar - like stars",
    ", it would be interesting to study their effects on the three - dimensional evolution of circumstellar discs in order to better understand the possible formation of misaligned planets .",
    "thus , we will perform simulations with perturber masses in the range [ 5:100 ] .",

    "the location of the pericenter has a significant meaning with respect to the torque that the perturber acts on the disc .",

    "for example , in the case of a 100 au disc , a smoothing length @xmath33 of 1 length unit would imply a sphere with radius 20 au within which only 40 sph particles are present .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamical quantities for such a sph particle with @xmath187 are computed by considering an unphysically large region with a diameter of 40 au .    in these extremely low resolution regions ,",
    "the shakura sunyaev parameter is not 0.02 anymore .",
    "the viscosity is extremely overestimated making the viscous evolution in the outer disc regions much faster .",
    "for this reason , both the inward motion of the particles as well as the smearing out of the viscous disc happen on a short timescale which is mainly due to the low numerical resolution in the outer regions .",
    "the increase of sph particles can not solve this problem , but rather shifts it to larger radii . a solution for this numerical problem could be the implementation of test loops in the code to check the adequacy of the smoothing length of a sph particle . in the case of insufficient resolution ,",
    "the particle could be treated as a purely n - body particle by ignoring the hydrodynamical terms . however , the reinclusion of the particle into the hydrodynamical fluid has to be considered , too .",
    "these modifications should be investigated with more detail .",
    "given the current simulation results , we point out that the outer regions of an initial thin disc could be strongly affected by a stellar perturber making an appropriate hydrodynamical description of the gas particles challenging .",
    "it has to be investigated in a subsequent work to which extent the gas particles can still be studied as a hydrodynamical entity .",
    "to summarize , directly after the stellar flyby , the disc evolves into a warped structure with the inner part of the disc being less inclined than the outer part of the disc .",
    "both the inner and the outer part have constant inclinations while the intermediate region shows a sharp transition between the two inclined regions .",
    "this warped structure is smeared out by the viscous disc so that at the end of our simulation , the disc inclination is dominated by the inner part .",
    "but note that for large radii , the numerical resolution of the sph method is insufficient due to small mass densities .",
    "thus , the accurate time - dependent evolution of the warped structure can not be described appropriately by our simulations .",
    "most of the disc mass is concentrated in the inner region . at @xmath188 ,",
    "more than 70% of the total disc mass is located inside @xmath177 .",
    "because of gas accretion in the inner region , the mass fraction inside @xmath177 decreases to 50% at @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the relevant part of the disc which defines the total inclination and dynamics of the disc is located in the inner region .    for comparison , we show the azimuthally averaged surface mass density of the disc ( upper panel ) and the averaged inclination of gas particles ( lower panel ) for a purely n - body simulation and timesteps in the range @xmath171 internal time units in fig . [",
    "fig : structure_nbody ] .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be the same as in the hydrodynamical simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "again , we show the radial domain up to @xmath98 within which all disc particles are located .",
    "the only difference between the n - body and the sph simulation is the lack of hydrodynamical evolution and thus no communication between the gas particles in the n - body case .    at @xmath85 ,",
    "the surface mass density profile of the n - body run is similar to the sph case .",
    "the density in the vicinity of the pericenter of the perturber is slightly higher than in the sph case because in the sph simulation , the particles are bound to the each other and thus can not move as freely as in the n - body case .    due to angular momentum loss to the perturber",
    ", the gas particles move inwards and settle down on their new orbits within 10 time units as can be seen in the new density profile with a higher mass amount in the inner region . during this period",
    ", we also observe an inclination increase in the inner regions and an inclination decrease in the outer regions which , as discussed in the sph case , is a result of angular momentum loss of the disc particles and removal of particles by the perturber .",
    "as there are no additional angular momentum changes of the particles , the final disc configuration is reached at @xmath182 . in this context",
    ", we note that @xcite performed a more complete n - body parameter study of inclined parabolic perturber orbits and their influences on massless test particles in order to study the disc sizes of protoplanetary discs .",
    "the striking difference between the n - body and sph simulation is the absence of a warped structure in the n - body simulation .",
    "the warping can only be produced if gas particles are allowed to communicate with each other .",
    "hence , the inclusion of hydrodynamical interaction of gas particles inside the disc is crucial when the evolution of inclination inside a protoplanetary disc is studied .",
    "dependent on the evolutionary stage of a disc which determines whether hydrodynamical interaction is still active or not , different outcomes can be gained which lead to different radial inclination distributions inside the disc .",
    "these results have direct consequences on the formation of misaligned planets .",
    "as we have shown with the numerical simulations , a single stellar flyby which generates inclination in the outer parts of a viscous disc can trigger the formation of a warped disc and a significantly inclined inner disc . for such a warped disc , the inclination of the inner part can be as high as several tens of degrees .",
    "planets that are formed in the inner region are naturally expected to have an initial orbital inclination as high as the inner disc inclination .",
    "the scenario of a stellar flyby can therefore be understood as a method to produce inclined protoplanetary discs which , at a later stage , form planets with misalignment angles of up to @xmath7 . subsequent planet migration could lead to the formation of misaligned hot jupiters .",
    "the angle with the highest final disc inclination is determined to be @xmath154 which is a retrograde orbit with an inclination of 45 .",
    "note that the angle with the maximum final disc inclination is expected to depend on the specific parameters and might vary for different parameter sets .",
    "the aim of this work was to test whether single stellar flybys are capable to generate significant disc inclinations which would allow the natural formation of misaligned planets and to identify the parameter sets associated with high final disc inclinations .",
    "for this , we have performed sph simulations in order to study the influence of single stellar flybys on the evolution of viscous protoplanetary discs .",
    "we have run simulations with a stellar pertuber being on a parabolic inclined orbit and the stellar mass ratio @xmath83 in the range @xmath189 $ ] , the impact parameter ( periastron distance relative to the outer disc radius ) @xmath190 $ ] and the two angles @xmath79 and @xmath80 which characterize the three - dimensional orientation for the perturber s orbit .",
    "these parameter ranges enabled us to cover a large parameter space for stellar flybys .",
    "we first studied the two extreme cases of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "both cases showed the same outcome with respect to the disc evolution .",
    "a perturber on a prograde inclined orbit is able to remove a large fraction of the initial disc mass and angular momentum .",
    "this result agrees well with previous works done by e.g. @xcite which showed that prograde orbits are most destructive .",
    "this high disc mass loss has direct impact on the total final disc inclinations . in the prograde cases ,",
    "a stellar flyby fails to generate any significant disc inclinations independently on the perturber s mass since all particles with high orbital inclinations are removed from the initial disc .",
    "those particles which have not been significantly disturbed by the perturber only harbour minor orbital inclinations .    for retrograde orbits ,",
    "the disc mass loss and angular momentum loss are much less than in the prograde case . in these cases ,",
    "significant disc inclinations up to 60could be generated .",
    "thereby , the final disc inclination decreases with increasing impact parameter @xmath131 and decreasing stellar mass ratio @xmath119 .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of stellar flybys with sufficiently small perturbations to which a disc is able to response linearly , our simulations have to be assigned to the non - linear regime . in this regime ,",
    "the final orientation of a gas disc is not only determined by precession of its angular momentum @xmath104 about the orbital angular momentum vector of the perturber @xmath107 as is the case in the linear regime .",
    "but it is rather determined by both the precession and the orbital inclination change of the disc . in the case of rigid body precession without change of orbital inclination",
    ", it is expected that the relative inclination @xmath112 between @xmath104 and @xmath107 should stay constant . however , in the most extreme cases of the perturber being on a retrograde inclined orbit , our simulations have revealed relative inclination changes by several tens of degrees . this is a clear indication that during stellar flybys with strong perturbations , orbital changes of the disc make a significant contribution to the final disc orientation .    in a next study , we have performed simulations with both @xmath79 and @xmath80 being @xmath92 .",
    "the results suggest that for given stellar mass ratio and impact factor , the most important condition for the generation of high disc inclinations is that the perturber s orbit is retrograde and inclined .",
    "the specific orientation of the pertuber s orbit thereby does not play a major role .",
    "the condition of a retrograde and inclined orbit and the arbitrariness of the specific orientation taken together make it very probable for close encounters to generate disc inclinations .",
    "but note that because of significant mass removal , disc inclinations above @xmath0 could not be generated by a single stellar flyby .",
    "a detailed study of the internal form of the viscous disc has revealed a clear warping .",
    "two different radial domains occured with significantly different orbital inclinations . while in the outer parts ,",
    "the disc inclination was very high and the disc mass was very low , most of the disc mass was concentrated in the inner region with @xmath191 where disc inclinations could still reach values above 50 .",
    "we also remark that due to insufficient resolution in the outer parts , the hydrodynamical description is not appropriate and alternative methods should be introduced in future work .",
    "more precisely , with the numerical work shown in this paper , we succeeded in simulating the formation of inclined and warped discs .",
    "however , their long - term evolution can not be described accurately due to insufficient numerical resolution of widely spreaded particles in the three - dimensional space .",
    "the insufficient resolution resulted in an extreme overestimation of the artificial viscosity which led to unphysically fast viscous evolution of the gas medium .    in connection with misaligned hot jupiters",
    ", our results suggest that single flybys can be responsible for the existence of hot jupiters with misalignment angles up to 60 . for these angles ,",
    "stellar flybys with realistic mass ratios of @xmath192 and impact parameters as small as @xmath143 are required .",
    "in section [ sec : mass ] , we have determined the probability of a solar - like star to have at least one close encounter with a massive star on a retrograde inclined orbit to be @xmath69 0.125 . given this relatively high probability of 12.5 per cent for close retrograde encounters , large disc inclinations or misaligned planetary orbits could be a result of stellar flybys . since single stellar flybys can result in orbital inclinations in the range [ 0:60 ] ,",
    "a large fraction of observed misaligned hot jupiters with angles below @xmath0 could be the result of only one single stellar flyby . although the scenario of single flybys fails to explain the formation of planets with even higher misalignment angles , it could be possible that a sequence of stellar flybys is responsible for their existence .",
    "the scenario of several stellar flybys has to be studied in a future project .",
    "another mechanism which involves the generation of high disc inclinations with the help of stellar flybys is the inclusion of possible mass accretion between the gas discs around two stars . in the simulations shown in this paper , we have only studied one gaseous disc around the primary star . in stellar clusters ,",
    "all stars are generally expected to possess an own gaseous envelope / disc .",
    "the gas disc around the passing star has not been included in our simulations . for close encounters , mass accretion from one disc to the other can play a major role in understanding the evolution of the disc inclination ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in order to understand subsequent results of stellar flybys involving two protoplanetary discs and make comparisons between the results , it is of great importance to firstly understand the effects of a single stellar flyby without mass accretion for which we have made major contributions in this paper .",
    "another justification for our survey without mass accretion is the possibility that a star has lost its gaseous envelope during an earlier close encounter so that for future encounters , it only appears as one single massive body . by including a second protoplanetary disc , additional parameters have to be included into the study .",
    "as the orientation of the second disc is not necessarily correlated to the orbit of the second star , different orientations of the second disc have to be studied for a specific orbit of the perturber .",
    "close encounters between stars with different stellar mass ratios @xmath119 and two gas discs with arbitrary orientations will be studied in a subsequent paper .    to summarize , single stellar flybys with the perturber being on a parabolic retrograde inclined orbit are capable to generate significant disc inclinations and hence provide the natural formation of misaligned hot jupiters .",
    "in consideration of the numerical survey , this scenario is very promising in explaining misalignment angles up to 60 .",
    "however , our proposed scenario fails to generate higher misalignment angles with @xmath193 because of the large amount of disc mass loss to the perturber . for",
    "highly inclined or even retrograde hot jupiters , alternative formation scenarios have to be studied such as mass accretion or a sequence of stellar flybys .",
    "these scenarios could help to fully understand the formation of misaligned hot jupiters .",
