    "the formulation of susy gauge theories on the lattice is problematic since the discretization breaks the poincar invariance , a sector of the superalgebra . in the wilson approach the suppression of unphysical states in the fermionic sector",
    "is obtained by the introduction of an extra - term ( wilson term ) which explicitly breaks susy .",
    "the restoration of susy in the continuum limit can be verified by considering the related lattice ward identities ( susy wis )  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the n=1 su(2 ) susy yang - mills theory ( sym ) ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is the susy version of quantum gluodynamics where gluons are accompanied by fermionic partners ( gluinos ) in the same ( adjoint ) representation of the color group . as a consequence of the explicit breaking of the symmetry ,",
    "the susy wis assume in the lattice theory a peculiar form .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the on - shell regime  @xcite .",
    "a subtracted gluino mass @xmath0 appears ; in addition , the susy current @xmath1 gets a multiplicative factor @xmath2 and a new mixing term @xmath3 is added to the nominal wis of the continuum .    in this contribution",
    "we present the non - perturbative determination of the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 from the numerical analysis of the susy wis .",
    "preliminary results were presented in  @xcite .",
    "more details , including related theoretical issues , will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "this study is also complemented by a perturbative computation  @xcite .",
    "the numerical computations were performed on the cray - t3e computers at john von neumann institute for computing ( nic ) , jlich .",
    "we thank nic and the staff at zam for their kind support .",
    "we consider the zero momentum lattice susy wi with insertion @xmath6 @xmath7 this wi is valid in the on - shell regime where @xmath8 and for gauge - invariant operators @xmath9 ( see  @xcite for the general case ) .",
    "we explain briefly the meaning of the various quantities in  ( [ renormward ] ) .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( sink operators ) are lattice forms of the susy current @xmath13 , the mixing current @xmath14 and the soft breaking operator @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the trace is taken on color indices and @xmath16 is the adjoint majorana field of the gluino .",
    "we consider  @xcite a local and a point - split definition of the currents .",
    "the field tensor @xmath17 is replaced by a clover - symmetric lattice field tensor .",
    "the quantities @xmath2 and @xmath18 are renormalizations coming from the lattice susy breaking , @xmath0 is the gluino mass shifted by additive renormalization . the condition @xmath19 is supposed to correspond , in the continuum limit , to the physical situation where the gluino is massless and susy is restored .    in our analysis",
    "we consider the lowest dimensional insertion operators @xmath9 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "one has essentially two choices  @xcite .",
    "one is the time - slice operator obtained from @xmath12 by discarding time - like plaquettes , @xmath21 ; another possibility is @xmath22 , extended in the time - direction .",
    "we smear the insertion operators by combined ape and jacobi smearing on the gluon and gluino fields respectively . smearing",
    "significantly improves the signal for @xmath23 but not for @xmath24 .",
    "this is presumably because the latter contains temporal links , for which a multi - hit procedure is more appropriate than smearing .",
    "such a procedure is however computationally too expensive in our setup with dynamical fermions .    for a given insertion @xmath9 the wi  ( [ renormward ] ) results in two independent equations when composing the spins of sink and insertion operators .",
    "the solution of the @xmath25 linear system allows the non perturbative determination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for each time - separation @xmath26 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : m_time ] for an example .",
    "alternatively we solve the overdetermined linear system for several time - separations @xmath27 ) ; the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are obtained in this way through a least - square fit .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]      configurations were generated on a @xmath28 lattice at @xmath29 by means of the two - step multi - bosonic algorithm ( tsmb ) .",
    "see  @xcite and references therein for more details on the algorithm .",
    "see also  @xcite for an application to qcd with three dynamical quark flavors .",
    "the configurations at @xmath30 were produced in  @xcite .",
    "results concerning @xmath30 and 0.194 were already presented in  @xcite .",
    "we add here more statistics at @xmath31 and a new simulation point , @xmath32 .",
    "the algorithmic setup was optimized in order to reduce autocorrelations for light gluinos .    in table",
    "[ tab ] we report the complete results for the global fit over a range of time - separations . the smallest time - separation included in the fit @xmath33 was chosen such that contact terms in the correlations are absent ; this means @xmath34 for insertion @xmath23 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "discretization effects can be evaluated by comparing determinations from different insertions , see data for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath37 we also report results for different definitions of @xmath23 , namely for the simple - plaquette definition of the field tensor and for different smearing parameters .",
    "the deviation ranges between @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath4 .",
    "data from @xmath36 are however subject to large statistical fluctuations and thus @xmath41 effects can not be reliably estimated .     as a function of @xmath42 with insertion @xmath23 ( diamonds ) and @xmath24 ( triangles ) and point - split currents .",
    "the filled circle is the result of the extrapolation , the filled triangle is the determination of @xmath43 of  @xcite . ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig ] we report the determination of @xmath4 as a function of the inverse hopping parameter .",
    "the expectation is that @xmath4 vanishes linearly when @xmath44 .",
    "we see a clear decrease when @xmath45 is increased towards @xmath43 .",
    "an extrapolation using data from insertion @xmath23 gives as a result : @xmath46 for the point - split currents and @xmath47 for the local ones .",
    "the result can be compared with the estimate @xmath48 from the study of the first order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "an analogous analysis for the quantity @xmath5 ( fitting to a constant , in this case ) gives @xmath49 for the point - split currents and @xmath50 for the local ones .",
