    "a great deal of progress over many years has been made in understanding the _ physics _ of the bonding and electronic structure in pure magnetic iron@xcite and this has been used with great effect to advance the generation of schemes from density functional theory in the gradient corrected@xcite local spin density approximation@xcite ( lsda - gga ) through the tight binding approximation@xcite to classical interatomic potentials to be used for atomistic simulations by the _ materials science _",
    "community.@xcite of course the metallurgist is rarely interested in pure iron and so the challenge to the physicist has been to extend the theory to include interstitial carbon , which is the defining element whose presence distinguishes steel from iron .",
    "it is only in the last decade that real progress has been made ; first with some very extensive lsda - gga calculations,@xcite second with the generation of ( admittedly very complicated ) classical interatomic potentials based in the embedded atom method,@xcite and third , the subject of this paper , by some recent semi empirical quantum mechanical schemes based in the tight binding approximation .",
    "a particularly significant advance was made recently by hatcher , madsen and drautz@xcite who constructed a very simple orthogonal tight binding model for carbon and iron using a minimal basis of c-@xmath3 and fe-@xmath4 orbitals and a local charge neutrality condition .",
    "this model is a natural basis for a bond order potential,@xcite but we argue here that this basis may be too small to capture some of the physics of carbon in iron . instead we introduce a new model based in our earlier work on h  in fe@xcite employing a larger , non orthogonal basis of c-@xmath3 , fe-@xmath4 , and c  and fe-@xmath5 orbitals and treating charge transfer self consistently _ via _ an adjustable `` hubbard-@xmath6 '' parameter.@xcite the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_description ]",
    "we describe our new model for carbon in iron and in section  [ sec_predictions ] we demonstrate its predictive power in both the concentrated ( iron carbide ) and dilute impurity limits . in  [ sec_dimer ]",
    "we focus on the carbon dimer bound to a vacancy , taking in view the recent startling prediction from lsda - gga that this is a predominant point defect in steel.@xcite our discussion and conclusions are to be found in sections  [ sec_discussion ] and  [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "we take the same approach as in our earlier work on h  in fe@xcite which is similar to that of hatcher  @xcite on c in fe , namely to proceed from a given model for pure fe and generate a further parameterization for the interstitial element . in contrast to hatcher",
    "@xcite we do not use a direct projection of the lsda - gga hamiltonian onto a tight binding basis,@xcite instead we employ a genetic algorithm@xcite to fit the parameters to a small set of lsda - gga target data which enter an objective function , which is minimized . as a consequence of employing the simplest tight binding scheme , namely an orthogonal basis of only @xmath4-orbitals on the fe atoms and @xmath3-orbitals on the c  atoms , the model of hatcher  @xcite differs significantly from ours .",
    "one difference results from their underlying model for pure fe which includes an _ attractive _ bonding term in the total energy which is environment dependent and which accounts for a significant fraction of the total energy.@xcite this was intended as a surrogate for the missing @xmath5-electrons , but the fact that this term is large and _ negative _ is surprising as one expects the @xmath5-band to exert a _ positive _ pressure.@xcite another difference is that in the minimal basis having only @xmath3-orbitals on c  atoms the limit of pure carbon can only be approximately rendered since it is the @xmath7-hybridisation in carbon that leads to the rich variety of single , double and triple bonds and the competition between @xmath8-bonded graphite and @xmath9-bonded diamond .",
    "we will argue below that carbon @xmath7-hybridization plays a key role in the structural stability of iron carbides and also in controlling the configuration of the c@xmath0 dimer at an fe vacancy .",
    "therefore in the current work we employ a larger basis , namely @xmath5-  and @xmath4-orbitals on fe and @xmath5-  and @xmath3-orbitals on c  atoms from which we suppose that at the expense of greater computational cost we have a physically better motivated model .",
    "moreover we use a _ non orthogonal _ basis , and as we argued earlier@xcite we believe that this allows a more natural way to include environment dependence in the bond energy .",
    "the tight binding model that we present here is identical in its mathematical form to those we developed earlier.@xcite the functional forms of the bond and overlap integrals are @xmath10 and we tabulate all parameter values @xmath11 and @xmath12 in tables  [ tbl_intersite - parameters ] ( for fe  fe terms ) and  [ tbl_fe - ch - intersite - parameters ] ( for fe  c interactions ) .",
    "the fe  fe and fe  c pair potentials are @xmath13 noting the sign , so that in tables  [ tbl_intersite - parameters ] and  [ tbl_fe - ch - intersite - parameters ] parameter values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive .",
    "for fe  h the pair potential is @xmath16    0= = 0    0= = 0 -12pt    we take a rather sophisticated approach to cutting off the spacial dependence of these interactions .",
    "we require proper energy conservation in molecular dynamics and can not allow discontinuities in second derivatives of bond integral or pair potential functions .",
    "previously@xcite we implemented the cut off by _ augmenting _ ( that is , replacing ) the function with a polynomial of degree five within @xmath17 whose coefficients are chosen so as to match the function continuously and differentiably to its _ value _ at @xmath18 and to _ zero _ at @xmath19 .",
    "we chose @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the lattice constant of @xmath1-fe , so that functions are cut off to zero between second and third neighbors of the bcc lattice .",
    "subsequent improvements were introduced after making two observations.@xcite ( ) a smoother effect can be achieved using a _ multiplicative _ cut off ; that is , to multiply the function by a polynomial of degree five whose value is one at @xmath18 and zero at @xmath19 and whose coefficients again ensure that the function is everywhere continuous up to the second derivative .",
    "( ) because the multiplicative cut off `` inherits '' the shape of the function near @xmath18 better than the augmentative cut off , we found that we could move @xmath18 back to @xmath23 and achieve a smoother function overall .",
    "a second difference compared to our earlier work@xcite is that there we employed a volume dependent cutoff , whereas now we prefer to use a cut off that is fixed . because of this small modification it is necessary to obtain slightly amended pair potential parameters .",
    "we show these in table  [ tbl_intersite - parameters ] , and in table  [ tbl_pure - fe - properties ] some predicted properties of pure fe using both the canonical @xmath4-band model for fe and the non orthogonal @xmath24-model .",
    "our canonical model can be read from table  [ tbl_intersite - parameters ] simply by ignoring those parameters that do nt enter the hamiltonian .",
    "this model therefore differs from the canonical model that we published earlier.@xcite in fact it is worth pointing out that both these canonical @xmath4-band models reproduce the vacancy formation and migration energies better than our non orthogonal model ; although its @xmath25 is outside the experimental range it is in better agreement with published lsda - gga data . in our opinion",
    "the simplest canonical model is very appropriate for pure fe and we do not see the need for the additional , attractive `` embedding potential '' introduced by madsen  @xcite the inclusion of the @xmath5-band and non orthogonality in fe is only necessary once hydrogen or first row elements are included .",
    "the reason for this is that the valence @xmath5-band from these elements lies typically below the fe @xmath26-bands ; orthogonality constraints in the concentrated limit then push the fe @xmath27-band to above the fermi level . in the dilute limit",
    "the electronic structure has to differentiate between regions close to an impurity and those far from it where the iron @xmath27 local density of states returns to its position in pure  fe below the fermi level . to account properly for this effect",
    "the impurity and fe @xmath5-bands can not be neglected .",
    "of course in a minimal @xmath28 basis for fe  c tight binding models or bond order potentials _ both _",
    "@xmath5-bands are neglected which is internally consistent , but these models can not account for , say , the carbon @xmath7-hybridisation .",
    "0= = 0    0= = 0 -12pt      our approach to finding carbon on - site energy parameters , fe ",
    "c hamiltonian matrix elements and pair potential parameters is to fit these to just seven target data ( a refinement was done later to improve the model in the dilute limit , see section  [ sec_dilute ] ) .",
    "these data are taken from lsda - gga calculations and illustrated in figure  [ fig_fec - ev ] which shows the heat of formation of four compounds having the stoichiometry fec . these are either bcc @xmath1-fe or fcc @xmath2-fe with c interstitials in tetrahedral or octahedral sites . in the @xmath2-fe case",
    "these are identical to the zincblende and rocksalt crystal structures .",
    "we fitted our parameters to the four equilibrium volumes and three energy differences .",
    "the outcomes of the fitting are shown to the left of figure  [ fig_fec - ev ] and in table  [ tbl_properties - monocarbides ] .",
    "the resulting parameter values are tabulated in tables  [ tbl_intersite - parameters ] ,  [ tbl_on - site - parameters ] , and  [ tbl_fe - ch - intersite - parameters ] . for comparison and for completeness",
    "we also show parameters of our earlier model for hydrogen in fe.@xcite    it is important to make some comments about the energy ",
    "volume curves in figure  [ fig_fec - ev ] , also in relation to the equivalent data for the hydrogen interstitial.@xcite first , in the bcc structure both c  and h  prefer the tetrahedral site in the concentrated limit of fec and feh , and this remains the preferred site for h  into the dilute limit .",
    "in contrast carbon occupies the octahedral sites in both ferritic and austenitic steel . in @xmath1-fe , this is achieved at the expense of a local tetragonal distortion of the lattice so as to drive apart the two apical fe atoms in the irregular octahedron of the underlying bcc lattice .",
    "this is only possible if the c is sufficiently dilute , certainly more dilute than the stoichiometry fe@xmath29c , as we will see below , and in fact the crossover is around fe@xmath30c.@xcite second , in the fcc structure it is certainly striking that according to lsda - gga fec adopts the zincblende structure rather than the rocksalt structure , albeit at an expanded volume , as the tetrahedral interstice is much smaller than the octahedral .",
    "this is contrary to the behavior of hydrogen , even though its atomic radius is evidently smaller .",
    "again there is a crossover towards the dilute limit where c prefers the octahedral site in @xmath2-fe.@xcite we expect that the competition between the two sites in fec is driven by the @xmath7-hybridization which will be maximal in the four fold coordinated tetrahedral site , whereas the six fold octahedral site offers a bonding environment favorable to the 90@xmath31 bond angles of unhybridised @xmath3-orbitals .",
    "therefore it is surprising that the @xmath28-basis model@xcite reproduces this result correctly .",
    "we expect that this arises from the freedom of employing long ranged c  c interactions in that model.@xcite conversely we take the canonical point of view that c  c interactions should not extend beyond the first neighbor distance in diamond,@xcite as it is known that longer range terms do not improve tight binding models for diamond structure @xmath7-bonded elements.@xcite      taking the view that carbon ",
    "carbon interactions are to be curtailed beyond the usual definition of the chemical bond lengths of 1.21.5   , none of the tests that we will apply in section  [ sec_predictions ] will require us to specify the c  c bond integrals or pair potential .",
    "there is however one notable exception which we will be discussing in greater detail below .",
    "this is the observation from lsda - gga calculations@xcite that two carbon atoms bound to a monovacancy in fe will form a `` dimer molecule '' whose bond length is 1.44   . in our model",
    "we have the freedom to choose our c  c interactions at will since they do not affect any of the results in the concentrated limit .",
    "it would be desirable if an existing model for diamond could be adopted without modification and we have used a tight binding hamiltonian for diamond from harrison@xcite with parameters adapted by xu  @xcite ( our model is essentially that of harrison in terms of the scaling of the bond integrals and pair potential with bond length .",
    "we take over the bond integrals at the equilibrium volume in diamond from xu  but we do not adopt their scaling . ) in this way for the c  c parameters we use a simple power law model , namely @xmath32 with ( in rydberg a.u . ) @xmath33 @xmath34  a.u .",
    "leads to the correct lattice constant _ and _ bulk modulus in diamond carbon .",
    "unfortunately that choice of @xmath14 does not quite reproduce the energy and c  c bond length of the c@xmath0 molecule bound to the fe monovacancy .",
    "therefore we employ @xmath35  a.u .  which leads to about an 8% error in the diamond lattice constant .",
    "we have used the same value of @xmath14 to calculate the total energy of diamond which is the quantity we have used in figures  [ fig_fec - ev][fig_fe4c - ev ] to determine the heat of formation of fe  c compounds from elemental @xmath1-fe and diamond  c. this has the consequence that the tight binding theory consistently overestimates @xmath36 by 0.16  ry ( see for example figure  [ fig_fec - ev ] ) ; if we use the value @xmath34  a.u .",
    "the agreement with the lsda - gga is rather better . to keep the c",
    " c interactions to within the first neighbors as expected in diamond and in hydrocarbons , we apply a fixed multiplicative cut - off at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in this section we examine to what extent our model reproduces some previously published or our calculated lsda - gga data .",
    "we first compare tight binding with lsda - gga for a range of mostly fictitious fe ",
    "c compounds with stoichiometries fe@xmath0c , fe@xmath39c , and fe@xmath29c in figures  [ fig_fe2c - ev][fig_fe4c - ev ] .",
    "the lsda - gga calculations were done by means of the mixed - basis pseudopotential ( mbpp ) method.@xcite the pbe - gga exchange and correlation functional,@xcite optimally smooth norm conserving pseudopotentials@xcite for fe and c , * k*-points which are equivalent to @xmath40 chadi - cohen meshes for cubic structures , and a gaussian broadening by 0.2  ev were employed .",
    "the mixed basis consisted of plane waves up to a maximum kinetic energy of 340  ev and atom - centered basis functions with @xmath4-symmetry for fe atoms and with @xmath3-symmetry for c atoms which are confined to spheres with radii of 1.19  and 0.66respectively .",
    "the broad agreement between tight binding and lsda - gga is excellent and indeed in almost all instances the ordering in energy of the phases is correctly reproduced .",
    "0= = 0    we will focus most closely on the stoichiometry fe@xmath39c , figure  [ fig_fe3c - ev ] , which is the most significant composition in materials science due to the ubiquitous occurence of cementite in the microstructures of steels .",
    "it is also notable that a significant weakness in the tight binding model emerges here when trying to describe the hypothetical _ substitutional _ phases d0@xmath39 , l6@xmath41 , l1@xmath0 , and d0@xmath42 .",
    "this is not so surprising since this bonding environment is very different from the _ interstitial _ phases and fortunately the substitutional phases are not of particularly great interest .",
    "it is on the other hand very gratifying that the tight binding model reproduces with great fidelity the @xmath43  and @xmath44  iron carbide phases . at the same time",
    "the ordering of the unfavorable simple hexagonal tungsten carbide like structure is very well rendered ; this hypothetical structure is obtained from the hexagonal close packed @xmath43-fe@xmath39c by rotating alternate fe layers about the @xmath45-axis by 60@xmath31 and increasing the axial ratio by @xmath46 . to emphasise the suitability of the tight binding approximation in the modeling of steel microstructures , we show in table  [ tbl_epsilon - theta - carbides ] a detailed comparison of the calculated crystal lattice parameters of the important phases , @xmath43  and @xmath44  iron carbide , with experimental data .      of equal or even greater",
    "interest is the behavior of carbon in the dilute limit . in the case of hydrogen in fe",
    "we could claim a success in that a model fitted in the most concentrated stoichiometry transfers very well into the dilute limit.@xcite carbon in fe has been more problematic and subsequent to the fitting described in section  [ subsec_fec ] it was necessary to make further genetic optimizations of the fe  c parameters in order to render correctly the migration energy and the binding of c to a monovacancy  the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48(1 ) in the first two data columns of table  [ tbl_dilute - properties ] .",
    "0= = 0 -12pt    0= = 0 -12pt    our main results are presented in tables  [ tbl_dilute - properties ] and  [ tbl_dimer - properties ] .",
    "we have constructed cubic @xmath49 supercells for @xmath1-fe and @xmath2-fe in order to study , in particular , the energetics of the monovacancy in fe and its binding to carbon interstitials . as in the case of hydrogen",
    ", the impurity does not occupy a vacant fe lattice site , as is clear from figure  [ fig_fe3c - ev ] which shows a large positive heat of formation for the four substitutional phases considered .",
    "instead ( again , as does hydrogen ) carbon occupies a position close to its preferred interstitial site , in this case the octahedral interstice , at one of the cube faces bounding the vacancy .",
    "we follow the definitions employed by becquart  @xcite such that the binding energy of one or more interstitials to a vacancy is the difference in energy between that number of interstitials and the vacancy occupying separate , non interacting sites , and the interstitials bound to the vacancy . in this way",
    ", we have , from calculations based on a 128-atom supercell of pure fe , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the signs are employed such that a positive binding energy implies a preference for the two c  atoms to bind at a vacancy compared to the vacancy and two c  interstitials being widely separated .",
    "the total energies @xmath52 involved are calculated by relaxing supercells containing the numbers of atoms indicated in parentheses .",
    "we therefore show in table  [ tbl_dilute - properties ] @xmath53 , the binding energy of a single c atom to a monovacancy , and @xmath48(2k ) ( using the designations of becquart  @xcite ) the binding energy of two c  atoms to a vacancy .",
    "we have also calculated migration energies of carbon in @xmath1-fe and @xmath2-fe using static relaxations and also the nudged elastic band method.@xcite tb describes these correctly in both phases of fe as seen in the data columns 1 , 4 , and 5 in table  [ tbl_dilute - properties ] .",
    "in particular our tb model confirms the lsda - gga result that the diffusion path of c  in @xmath2-fe is _ not _ as one might suppose mediated by a `` double '' hop _ via _ a neighboring tetrahedral site as for h  in @xmath2-fe , but the carbon atom actually takes a direct route forcing itself through the bond center of two nearest neighbor fe atoms at the @xmath54  ( d ) saddle point .",
    "this is surprising in view of the high energy of the @xmath2-d crystal structures in figures  [ fig_fe3c - ev ] and  [ fig_fe4c - ev ] .",
    "however this tight binding prediction agrees with lsda - gga results.@xcite      several authors have made lsda - gga calculations for a carbon dimer bound to a vacancy in @xmath1-fe and described a number of possible atomic structures.@xcite we consider four here .",
    "if the dimer is orientated along a @xmath55 direction , then if the carbon atoms remain close to their original octahedral sites at opposite faces of the cube bounding the vacancy , this configuration is designated `` j '' by becquart  @xcite or `` oo '' by lau  @xcite this is a _ local minimum _ in the energy and in our tb model the two carbon atoms are outside their range of interaction in the hamiltonian ( see section  [ subsec_cc ] ) .",
    "the energy is lowered if the two carbon atoms approach each other along the @xmath55 direction and form a dimer bond , having a bond length of 1.46  which is very close to that in diamond and the c  c single bond in molecules .",
    "this configuration is denoted `` @xmath55 '' by lau  @xcite but was not considered in earlier work.@xcite this is not yet the global minimum energy for the dimer which is achieved by orientating the dimer along a @xmath56 direction with the two c  atoms close to octahedral positions , a situation denoted `` k '' by becquart  @xcite or `` ao '' by lau  @xcite the latter authors describe a further configuration , `` @xmath57 '' in which the dimer bond is centered at the vacant site and orientated parallel to `` k '' .",
    "this is of slightly higher energy than `` k '' .",
    "the four configurations are are illustrated in figure  [ fig_dimer ] . in table",
    "[ tbl_dimer - properties ] we compare predictions of the tb model with our own lsda - gga results.@xcite the only serious discrepancy is that the tb model overestimates the energies of the `` j '' and `` @xmath56 '' configurations with respect to lsda - gga .",
    "frst  @xcite made a very thorough study using lsda - gga of point defect complex energetics and found the remarkable result that under the conditions normally encountered in a steel , effectively _ all fe vacancies have a c@xmath0 dimer bound to them _ as illustrated in figure  [ fig_dimer ] .",
    "moreover , by just a few hundredths of an ev , the dimer prefers to be orientated along a @xmath58 direction .",
    "it would be of great interest to determine whether this phenomenon can be confirmed experimentally , possibly by internal friction measurements .",
    "it is notable that a similar prediction was made using dft concerning dimerization of boron in copper , a prediction that is consistent with thermodynamic assessment.@xcite        one can interpret the competition between the four configurations illustrated in figure  [ fig_dimer ] in terms of certain notional contributions to the total energy .",
    "these are ( )  the formation of a c  c covalent bond , ( )  the coordination of the carbon atoms to neighboring fe atoms , and ( )  the accompanying distortion of the host fe lattice containing a vacancy .",
    "( )  it is surprising that a c  c bond having the same length as in pure carbon is formed in view of the metallic electron gas destroying the single bond order ; the bond length inside the metal is the same as in the pure carbon or hydrocarbon , but the bond energy is about ten times smaller .",
    "( )  the fe  c coordination goes a long way to explain the stability of the most stable configuration `` k '' in which the carbon dimer makes three bonds of equal length ( 3.65 ) to fe atoms , thus forming an `` ethane '' molecule in which the fe atoms take the part of h  atoms ( see figure  [ fig_dimer](d ) ) . with the dimer orientated along @xmath55",
    "each carbon atom makes four bonds ( 3.73  long ) to neighboring fe atoms ( figure  [ fig_dimer](b ) ) .",
    "we take it that this is less favorable owing to carbon preferring a four fold coordination .",
    "configurations `` j '' and `` @xmath58 '' both display a planar configuration of fe ",
    "c bonds ; in `` j '' the carbon is bonded to four fe atoms in the plane of a cube face of the bcc lattice , in `` @xmath58 '' each carbon is bonded to two fe atoms .",
    "( )  in table  [ tbl_dimer - properties ] we give in parentheses values of the calculated total energies of the four configurations , _ having removed the two carbon atoms _ and leaving the fe atoms in their positions .",
    "this is intended to examine the elastic distortion energy accompanying the introduction of the dimer into the vacancy . in the lsda - gga",
    "these distortion energies are rather small and in fact `` @xmath55 '' has a slightly lower value than `` k '' .",
    "however the preferred four fold coordination of the carbon atoms in `` k '' is able to compensate for the increased distortion energy . whereas the tb model correctly predicts `` k '' to be the global minimum , the quantitative comparison with lsda - gga is rather poor .",
    "we suppose that this is a consequence of the small basis set of tb and more limited self consistency .",
    "thus tb _ overestimates _ effects based on covalent bonding and lattice distortions because the hamiltonian does not have the degrees of freedom of lsda - gga to find a lower energy in the case of an unfavorable structure .",
    "this is well illustrated in the case of `` @xmath58 '' in figure  [ fig_dimer](c ) .",
    "clearly there is a large distortion of the bcc cubic unit cell surrounding the vacancy .",
    "the lsda - gga given the constraint of this distortion in the _ atomic _ structure is yet able to find a low energy _ electronic _ structure that can accommodate the constraint .",
    "the tb finds this much more difficult .",
    "the tb model presented here is intended as a physically better motivated and more transferable scheme as compared to the recently published orthogonal @xmath28-model@xcite or to existing classical interatomic potentials .",
    "its transferability has been demonstrated using tests in both concentrated and dilute limits , for example successfully predicting the structure and energetics of cementite ( section  [ sec_concentrated ] ) and the migration path of c  in @xmath2-fe ( section  [ sec_dilute ] ) .",
    "it may be thought that this migration path particularly would expose the need for environment dependence in an empirical model@xcite our model , using only two - center parameters , is able to deal with this through the use of an overlap matrix between non orthogonal fe and c orbitals.@xcite    our model also correctly describes the structure and energetics of the carbon dimer bound to a vacancy in @xmath1-fe  a defect that is expected to take a central importance following the predictions of frst  @xcite apart from a large overestimation of the energy of the `` @xmath56 '' dimer , our tb model properly orders the structures and predicts `` k '' to have the lowest energy although we were forced to modify an existing simple model for carbon in order to achieve the correct c@xmath0 bond length ( see section  [ subsec_cc ] ) .",
    "it is notable that published classical potentials@xcite and the minimal basis tb model@xcite can not reproduce the stability of the carbon dimer .",
    "an exception is the recent classical potential of lau  @xcite although this model greatly _ overestimates _ the binding energy of the @xmath56 dimer .    in view of the apparent significance of carbon dimers",
    "existing in the microstructure of steel and their possible interactions with hydrogen@xcite it is now a matter of importance that plausible and efficient quantum mechanical models are produced . from this point of view",
