    "gro  j1849 - 03 is a periodic transient hard x - ray source in the direction of the 5-kpc arm ( zhang et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the source was discovered using the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory and shows recurrent hard x - ray ( 20100  kev ) outbursts with a period of @xmath0  days ( zhang et al .",
    "the source produced a hard x - ray outburst detected with batse in september 1996 lasting from mjd 50340 to mjd 50358 ( barret et al .",
    "the maximum of the outburst occurred near mjd 50347 .    in an effort to determine an accurate position for gro  j1849 - 03",
    ", an observation was made with the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the _ satellite italiano per astronomia x _",
    "( bepposax ) on 17 - 18 september 1996 ( mjd 50343 - 50344 ) .",
    "the observation was scheduled to occur during the predicted hard x - ray outburst .",
    "an integration of 7712  s was obtained in two spacecraft orbits .",
    "the data were analyzed using the standard wfc software ( version 101 - 104 ) and sources were extracted using the iterative removal of sources ( iros ) software ( hammerslay 1986 ; int zand 1992 ) .",
    "we chose to use a relatively hard band ( 521  kev ) for the analysis since the x - ray sources in the 5-kpc arm have high column densities ( koyama et al .",
    "1990a ) and also since the batse detection of the source extends down only to 20  kev .",
    "no sources were detected within the @xmath1 batse error box above a flux of @xmath2 for the 5 - 21  kev band at @xmath3 confidence .",
    "eleven sources were detected at high confidence in the wfc field of view .",
    "the only source detected near gro  j1849 - 03 is x1845 - 024 ( doxsey et al .",
    "the wfc source is within 3 of the known position of x1845 - 024 ; this is consistent with the position uncertainty from the wfc .",
    "the source flux is @xmath4 for the 5 - 21  kev band .",
    "x1845 - 024 lies within @xmath5 of the batse position for gro  j1849 - 03 ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ) as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "we produced a light curve for x1845 - 024 , shown in fig .",
    "2 , using the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) to search for transient behavior similar to that observed from gro  j1849 - 03 . the light curve was produced from the `` definitive data products '' provided by the asm / rxte teams at mit and at the rxte sof and gof at nasa s gsfc .",
    "each point represents the asm counting rate in the 512  kev band averaged over 4 days .",
    "points with errors larger than 0.3  c / s have been suppressed for clarity .",
    "inspection of the light curve ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows two outburst events .",
    "the first starts on mjd 50342 and lasts until approximately mjd 50366 .",
    "the peak occurs near mjd 50350 - 50354 .",
    "this x - ray outburst coincides with the september 1996 outburst of gro  j1849 - 03 detected by batse .",
    "the main parts of the x1845 - 024 and the gro  j1849 - 03 outbursts overlap . a second outburst in the x - ray light curve of x1845 - 024 occured during the interval mjd 50589 - 50598 with the peak near mjd 50591 - 50594 .",
    "hard x - ray emission was detected with batse from the direction of x1845 - 024 over the interval mjd 50585 - 50597 .",
    "the second outburst found in the asm is approximately 240 - 243 days after the first .",
    "the period between outbursts matches the known period of gro  j1849 - 03 ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "our wfc observation shows that x1845 - 024 is the only bright source within the @xmath5 error box for gro j1849 - 03 near the time of the september outburst .",
    "the detection of two x - ray outbursts from x1845 - 024 simultaneous with hard x - ray outbursts detected by batse from gro  j1849 - 03 lead us to conclude that gro j1849 - 03 and x1845 - 024 are the same object .",
    "the outburst of gs  1843 - 02 detected by ginga ( koyama et al .",
    "1990b ) occurred at a time only @xmath1 away from the extrapolation of the batse ephemeris for gro  j1849 - 03 ( zhang et al .",
    "it is likely that gs  1843 - 02 is also x1845 - 024 ( makino et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "the composite batse / asm spectrum for the interval mjd 50331.5 - 50358.5 is adequately fit by a exponentially cutoff power law with a photon index of @xmath6 , a cutoff energy of @xmath7 , and a column density of @xmath8 .",
    "these are consistent with the spectral parameters and column density found for gs  1843 - 02 ( koyama et al .",
    "this lends support to the identification of gs  1843 - 02 and x1845 - 024 .",
    "we searched for pulsations with periods near 94.8  s in the wfc data .",
    "however , the results were inconclusive due to the weakness of the source and the presence of the bright and highly variable source grs  1915 + 105 in the wfc field of view .",
    "we did not search for pulsations in the asm data as the 94.8  s period is nearly commensurate with the 90  s duration of individual asm dwells .",
    "pulsations at the 94.8  s period of x1845 - 024 have not been detected from gro  j1849 - 03 except for a marginal detection during the latter part of one outburst ( zhang et al .",
    "however , the upper limit of 35% pulsed fraction in the 2050  kev band is not strongly inconsistent with the 40% pulsed fraction observed by ginga at lower energies ( koyama et al .",
    "gs  1843 - 02 is an x - ray pulsar with a pulse period of 94.8  s ( koyama et al . 1990a ) .",
    "given the association of gro  j1849 - 03 , gs  1843 - 02 , and x1845 - 024 , we can classify the system based on its pulse and orbital period via the method of corbet ( 1986 ) .",
    "we assume that the 241  day outburst recurrence time is the orbital period . fig .",
    "3 shows a plot of pulse versus orbital period for high - mass x - ray binaries , a ` corbet diagram ' , indicating the position of x1845 - 024 .",
    "the object clearly lies in the region of the diagram occupied by be - star systems .",
    "the location of the source , coincident with the 5 kpc arm , lends some support to the be - star binary identification , as ir observations of the region show that it contains a population of young stars ( hayakawa et al .",
    "1981 ) with ages consistent with those estimated for be / x - ray binaries ( van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 ) .",
    "if the source lies within the 5-kpc arm , at a distance of 10  kpc , the unabsorbed luminosity of the source during outburst is @xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with luminosities observed from long orbital period be / x - ray binaries .",
    "x1845 - 024 lies slightly below the main track of be systems on the corbet diagram . the observed correlation between spin and orbital periods of x - ray pulsars in be - star binaries is believed to depend on the interaction between the neutron star magnetic field and the be - star outflow .",
    "x1845 - 024 may have a relatively small value of the density vs. radius index ( @xmath10 between 3 and 3.25 ) and/or a low initial outflow velocity ( @xmath11 ) compared to other be systems ( waters & van kerkwijk 1989 ) . since no centrifugal barrier is expected for a neutron star with a spin period of 94.8  s , the duration of x - ray outbursts should be directly related to the size or width of the be - star equatorial outflow .",
    "identification of the optical or ir companion of x1845 - 024 and a study of its mass outflow may help provide a better understanding of the spin and orbital period correlation ."
