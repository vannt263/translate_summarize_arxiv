    "the cooperative spontaneous emission of radiation ( superradiance ) from an ensemble was first introduced by dicke in 1954 @xcite , where an atomic ensemble exhibited enhanced coupling to a single electromagnetic mode .",
    "superradiance was initially suggested for sample dimensions @xmath0 much smaller than the wavelength @xmath1 of the resonant transition @xcite .",
    "however , the case in the opposite limit @xmath2 has also attracted extensive research @xcite because in quantum optics the sample is usually large compared to @xmath1 .",
    "in such a large - size sample , the superradiance is difficult to happen according to the standard argument that the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms is too weak to build a macroscopic dipole moment . to have enhancement in the limit of large - size sample with @xmath2 , the quantum coherence and interference",
    "must enter to play a role .",
    "typical example is to employ the quantum coherence to enhance some nonlinear optical processes @xcite .",
    "recently , our group observed an enhanced raman scattering effect by using an atomic spin wave , a coherence prepared between atomic ground - state sublevels @xcite . the subsequent theoretical analysis modeled the experiment where an early spontaneous raman scattering ( srs ) generated the atomic spin wave which causes enhancement of the raman light fields in the second raman scattering @xcite .",
    "the flipped atoms act as seeds to the second raman process which amplifies the light fields all the way through the atomic ensembles .    in this paper , based on our previous work @xcite",
    ", we propose a scheme to enhance the raman scattering , termed as correlation - enhanced raman scattering ( cers ) . in the scheme",
    ", a pump field leads to spontaneous emission of the stokes field , accompanying with the generation of atomic spin waves .",
    "then this stokes field used as a seeded signal , with the pump field together , is subsequently input into atomic ensemble to generate a second stokes field .",
    "a cers occurs due to the correlation of the seeding stokes field and atomic spin waves @xcite .",
    "such a light - atom correlation is a new mechanism to enhance raman scattering , which is different from the idea of the so - called super raman scattering initiated by the atom - atom entangled state @xcite .",
