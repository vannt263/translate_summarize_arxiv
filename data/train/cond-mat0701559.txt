    "<S> we study the spin polarization and its associated spin - hall current due to electric - dipole - induced spin resonance in disordered two - dimensional electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the disorder induced damping of the resonant spin polarization can be strongly reduced by an optimal field configuration that exploits the interference between rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a striking enhancement of the spin susceptibility while the spin - hall current vanishes at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> we give an interpretation of the spin current in geometrical terms which are associated with the trajectories the polarization describes in spin space .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability to coherently control the spin of charge carriers in semiconductor nanostructures is the main focus of spintronics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> band - structure and confinement effects in these systems lead to a strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) offering the possibility to efficiently access the charge carrier spin via the control of its orbital motion@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a versatile and efficient scheme of spin control is electric dipole induced spin resonance ( edsr)@xcite where electric radio frequency ( rf ) fields give rise to internal fields coupling to the spin . </S>",
    "<S> choosing an adequate configuration of the electric rf fields and a static magnetic field defining a quantization axis for the spin , arbitrary spin rotations can be realized . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to standard paramagnetic spin resonance techniques , has the advantage , however , that it can be integrated in gated nanostructures thereby avoiding magnetic rf coils .    in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with pure rashba </S>",
    "<S> soi the amount of spin polarization which can be achieved by edsr is severely limited by disorder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar limitations are found for pure dresselhaus soi . </S>",
    "<S> however , if both dresselhaus and rashba soi are present interference between the two soi mechanisms can occur and qualitatively new behavior emerges , such as anisotropy in spin relaxation@xcite and transport@xcite . for spin relaxation </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy is most pronounced if both sois have equal strength . in this case , the spin along the @xmath0 $ ] direction [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vectorfields ] ] is conserved@xcite , and the associated spin relaxation rates vanish , whereas they become maximal along the perpendicular direction @xmath1 $ ] . for the driven system considered here </S>",
    "<S> we show that similar interference effects occur and that not only the internal rf field but also the edsr linewidth becomes dependent on the direction of the magnetic field . in a microscopic approach we show then that due to this dependence an optimal configuration exists where the linewidth and the internal field simultaneously become minimal and maximal , resp . , and that , as a remarkable consequence , the spin susceptibility gets dramatically enhanced . in other words , this optimal configuration allows one to obtain a high spin polarization with relatively small electric fields and thus making the power consumption for spin polarization minimal .    due to spin - orbit interaction angular momentum can be transferred between spin and orbital degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this fact leads , in particular , to a dynamical coupling between spin and spin current described by the heisenberg equation of motion@xcite . exploiting this coupling </S>",
    "<S> we show that the spin current can be interpreted in geometrical terms : the spin dynamics generated by the rf fields describes an elliptical trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - hall conductivity can then be expressed entirely in terms of the semi - minor and semi - major axis and the tilt angle of this ellipse . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin dynamics ( trajectories ) is experimentally accessible , for instance with optical methods@xcite , this opens up the possibility for a direct measurement of the spin - hall current . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that for the optimal configuration the spin current vanishes , in stark contrast to the spin polarization which , as mentioned , becomes maximal .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a non - interacting 2deg consisting of electrons with mass @xmath2 and charge @xmath3 which are subject to a random impurity potential @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account linear soi @xmath5 of the rashba - and dresselhaus type where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices and @xmath7 is the canonical momentum . taking the coordinate axes along the @xmath8 , [ 010 ] , [ 001]$ ] crystallographic directions , the internal magnetic field @xmath9 is then given by ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vector potential associated with @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 the electron g - factor and @xmath23 the bohr magneton .    </S>",

    "<S> _ we turn now to the calculation of the spin polarization ( magnetization@xmath24 ) per unit area , @xmath25 , evaluated in linear response to an applied electric field @xmath26/2 $ ] and in the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus soi . due to the interference between these two soi mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> we need to carefully extend earlier calculations@xcite , which were restricted to rashba ( dresselhaus ) soi only , to this new situation . we will then be able to identify a configuration that allows one to obtain a maximum degree of spin polarization due to this interference .    </S>",
    "<S> working in the linear response regime , @xmath27 is obtained from a kubo formula averaged over the random distribution of impurities in the 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate this average with standard diagrammatic techniques assuming the impurities to be short - ranged , isotropic and uniformly distributed . in this case , the impurity average @xmath28 is @xmath29 - correlated and proportional to the momentum relaxation time @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we further take the fermi energy @xmath31 to be the largest energy scale in the problem . then , to leading order in @xmath32 with @xmath33 the mean free path , the averaged spin polarization is given by the diffuson diagram , giving rise @xcite to a correction @xmath34 of the spin vertex ( cf . ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) in the kubo formula . </S>",

    "<S> this regime is characterized by @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the components @xmath43 with @xmath44 of the vertex correction are then found to be given by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 . here , the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are second order in @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and depend on the frequency @xmath51 , the larmor frequency @xmath52 , and the angle @xmath53 and @xmath48 are too lengthy to be written down here . in the following , only @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the linear combination @xmath56 are relevant for the linewidth and the spin - hall conductivity , resp . , which are explicitly given below in eqs.([eq : damping2 ] ) and ( [ eq : spin - current - explicit ] ) . ] . in the edsr system , </S>",
    "<S> pauli paramagnetism gives rise to a constant equilibrium polarization @xmath57 along @xmath58 which is independent of the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization dynamically generated by @xmath59 , however , depends on the amplitude of the oscillating internal field perpendicular to @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus instructive to consider the longitudinal ( along @xmath60 ) and the transverse ( along @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) polarization components given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , resp .    as a result </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : vectorfields ] we plot the spin susceptibility at resonance , @xmath87 /\\gamma$ ] for the case @xmath88 measured in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath89 has been tuned to maximize @xmath90 which displays a pronounced dependence on the magnetic field direction . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : damping2 ] ) we note that @xmath85 scales with the mean square fluctuations of the internal magnetic fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes a uniform average over all ( in - plane ) directions @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with a simple model@xcite of spin relaxation ( bloch equation ) shows that the first term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : damping2 ] ) comes from pure dephasing , i.e. from disorder induced fluctuations of the internal fields along @xmath58 , while the second term is due to fluctuations along @xmath80 . choosing a configuration with @xmath95 and tuning the soi strengths to @xmath96 the first term vanishes while the second is subject to narrowing due to the magnetic field . </S>",

    "<S> increasing the frequency such that ( at resonance ) @xmath99 will lead to an increase of the inverse width @xmath100 and , hence , of the susceptibility at resonance , given by @xmath101 for comparison , we find the ratio to the resonance susceptibility @xmath102 in the pure rashba case as @xmath103 $ ] growing quadratically with @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spin polarization can be substantially enhanced by tuning the sois to equal strengths and by increasing the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the range of validity for the linear response regime can be estimated as follows . assuming full polarization ( @xmath105 ) and parameters for a gaas 2deg @xcite with spin - orbit splitting @xmath106 , fermi wavelength @xmath107 and @xmath108 </S>",
    "<S> , we find from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pol - res ] ) that the linear response is valid for electric fields with amplitudes up to @xmath109 .    _ polarization and spin current . </S>",

    "<S> using the heisenberg equation of motion the spin current components @xmath111 and @xmath112 along @xmath80 and @xmath113 can be expressed in terms of the polarization at frequency @xmath51 as @xmath114 ( i \\omega s'^1 + \\omega_l       s'^3 ) - i \\omega \\beta \\cos ( 2 \\theta ) s'^2\\\\   ( \\alpha + \\beta \\sin      ( 2 \\theta ) )   i \\omega s'^2    -   \\beta \\cos ( 2 \\theta ) ( i \\omega      s'^1 + \\omega_l       s'^3 )   \\notag     \\end{array } \\right ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider the configuration @xmath115 such that the soi induced internal rf field is perpendicular to @xmath58 and the longitudinal component @xmath116 is not altered in linear response in @xmath117 . note that in this case eq.([eq : spin - current - rd ] ) simplifies such that @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> this relation differs from the naive model of an average spin - orbit field equating the internal field @xmath119 with its average @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to eq.([eq : spin - current - rd ] ) , we then find @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a phenomenological transverse relaxation rate . </S>",
    "<S> discrepancies to the model of an averaged spin - orbit field occur similarly for other effects such as the generation of an out - of plane polarization@xcite and zitterbewegung@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by evaluating the spin - hall current @xmath111 in terms of the vertex correction eq.([eq : vertex - correction ] ) which was obtained in the diagrammatic approach and is valid up to second order in @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear combination @xmath123 cancels in lowest order ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> this limit depends only on the ratio @xmath130 of the strengths of the sois , but not on their absolute values , and agrees with the clean limit found in@xcite for @xmath131 . indeed , for the condition @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) </S>",
    "<S> , many cycles of the electric rf field pass through between subsequent scattering events such that the system effectively behaves as ballistic . </S>",
    "<S> this regime can be exploited to achieve high spin polarizations as described above .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the singularity in eq.([eq : spin - current - rd ] ) for @xmath96 is removed in eq.([eq : spin - current - explicit ] ) up to the accuracy @xmath134 considered here and we find that @xmath135 vanishes in the configuration where @xmath136 is maximal , i.e. for @xmath96 and @xmath137 .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to a geometrical interpretation of the spin hall current relating it to the trajectories @xmath138 followed by the tip of the polarization vector . for an applied electric field </S>",

    "<S> we can further determine the angle @xmath29 enclosed by the semi - major axis of @xmath149 and the @xmath152 direction since the matrix @xmath153 is diagonalized by a rotation @xmath29 around @xmath154 . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , we obtain the spin hall current ( eq.([eq : spin - current - rd ] ) ) at resonance ( @xmath160 ) as @xmath161 eq . ( [ eq : spin - current - ab - res ] ) provides a remarkable interpretation of the spin hall current in terms of the geometric properties of the orbit @xmath149 . </S>",
