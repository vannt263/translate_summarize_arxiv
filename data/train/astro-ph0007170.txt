    "stars with far - infrared excesses generated in circumstellar disks were discovered in abundance by the iras mission . since circumstellar material disappears over time due to processes such as stellar winds , radiation pressure , and accretion onto stars and planetesimals , most infrared excess stars are young , @xmath310@xmath4  yr @xcite . to develop an understanding of the evolution of circumstellar material and its relationship to the formation of planets , detailed studies of individual disks must be combined with information about stellar ages .",
    "however , stars which are nearing the main sequence are difficult to age because they lack traditional indicators such as lithium and x - ray emission and they move through the color - magnitude diagram very quickly .    the herbig aebe stars ( haebes )",
    "are thought to be in this transition phase , intermediate in evolution between protostars and stars on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "the classical definition of haebes , i.e. that they are of spectral type a or earlier , are found in clouds , and show emission lines and reflection nebulae @xcite almost certainly selects for such young objects .",
    "in addition , more recent studies @xcite use the presence of near or far - infrared excess to select haebes .",
    "thus , objects such as hd 141569 , a b9.5  ve star with h@xmath5 in emission and 12100  excess , which are not associated with any cloud or reflection nebula , fall into the haebe class .",
    "there have been attempts to date haebe stars within this general picture based on the strength of their infrared excesses @xcite , and authors have proposed an evolutionary sequence from the embedded haebes to the isolated @xmath0 pictoris or vega - like main sequence stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .",
    "the presence of lower mass companions to these objects represents an independent way of measuring their age , assuming they and the companions are coeval .",
    "lower mass companions may not yet be on the zams and their ages can be estimated from theoretical pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks . for early - type stars near the zams which also have circumstellar dust ,",
    "this is probably the most accurate way to determine the disk age .",
    "the well - studied disk stars , @xmath0 pic , fomalhaut , and hr 4796a , were all dated by their association with lower mass co - moving companions @xcite .",
    "hd 141569 is joining the ranks of well - studied dusty disk stars with the discovery of its large and morphologically complicated debris disk @xcite . in 1938 , rossiter identified hd 141569 as a member of a potential triple system with a second star 7.@xmath25 away ( b ) and a third star 1.@xmath25 from it ( c ) @xcite . in a study of haebes , @xcite measured the spectral type of hd141569b as g0  v , and @xcite concluded , based on its magnitude and color , that it was a background star .",
    "however , @xcite noted the presence of `` peculiar '' emission lines in the spectrum of hd 141569b , including ca h and k and h@xmath0 , which are often associated with young stars .",
    "the parallactic distance to hd 141569a was measured by the hipparcos mission as 99@xmath610 pc , which combined with its visual magnitude of 6.8 , makes it underluminous for its spectral type , just as are other young a - type infrared excess stars such as @xmath0 pic , 49 ceti and hr 4796a @xcite ( see also figure [ fig_hr ] ) .",
    "given the apparent proximity of two stars to hd 141569a , and given that the disk around hd 141569a extends to half of the projected distance between hd 141569a and b , this system could be dynamically interesting if the three stars are physically associated . in this paper ,",
    "we show , via comparison to previous astrometry plus new near infrared imaging and visual spectroscopy , that hd 141569 a / b / c form a triple system , and we estimate their ages .",
    "on 1998 september 27 , short integration time images of the hd 141569 system were obtained with the nicmos camera 2 on the hubble space telescope in order to acquire the primary star for coronagraphic observations .",
    "two simple accum mode images of 0.342 s each were taken with the f171 m filter ( @xmath7=1.721 , fwhm=0.071 ) and ten dark frames of the same integration time were taken two days earlier for calibration of those acquisition images .",
    "the two source images were used for cosmic ray rejection by taking the minimum of the two values for every pixel .",
    "the median of the dark images was subtracted from the science image to remove the effects of detector shading and bias .",
    "the resulting image was divided by an on - orbit flat field frame taken in the same filter .",
    "the best available photometric calibration was applied in which 0  mag=948 jy and 1 adu s@xmath8 = 1.071@xmath910@xmath10 jy .",
    "near - infrared j ( @xmath11=1.27 , @xmath12=0.25 ) , h ( @xmath11=1.65 , @xmath12=0.32 ) , k ( @xmath11=2.20 , @xmath12=0.40 ) , and l@xmath13-band ( @xmath14=3.45 , @xmath12=0.57 ) images were taken with the hale 200-inch telescope on 1999 may 25 and 28 .",
    "the infrared camera had a pixel scale of 0.@xmath2125 per pixel and a full field of view of 32@xmath15 32@xmath2 .",
    "the night of 25 may was cloudy , but the flux ratios of b and c to star a were measured at j , h , and k bands .",
    "short integration time , 0.374 s , images were taken in which all three stars appear in every full - field frame .",
    "the seeing was 0.@xmath282 at k band , so stars b and c were easily resolved .",
    "so as not to saturate hd 141569a at j and h bands , the chopping secondary was used to smear the light in a direction perpendicular to the position angle ( pa ) , 301.9  between components b and c.    the night of 28 may was photometric and measurements of hd 141569a at all four wavelengths were preceded by measurements of the photometric standard hd 129655 . for both target and standard , an 8@xmath2 square subframe of the full array was employed to allow fast readout and prevent the images from saturating the bright primary at j and h or the thermal background at l@xmath13 . at each filter ,",
    "100 integrations of 0.07  s were coadded for a total on - source integration time of 7  s. one 0.54  s image of hd141569 b and c was also obtained at l@xmath13 .",
    "sky frames of the same integration time were obtained after every set of exposures on the stars .",
    "after sky subtraction , the images were flat fielded and corrected for hot pixels .",
    "aperture photometry was then performed on the final images .",
    "resolution @xmath165000 spectra of stars b and c were taken with the lris @xcite instrument on 1999 february 25 covering the spectral range of 6250@xmath177550 .",
    "a long slit of width 0.@xmath27 was placed at a pa of 301.9 deg to obtain simultaneous spectra of both b and c , and two integrations of 120  s each were made .",
    "the amplifier bias was estimated from the ccd over - read areas and subtracted from the spectra .",
    "a spectral flat field was made from halogen lamp exposures taken immediately after the spectra and was divided into the spectra .",
    "the seeing was 1.@xmath21 , so b and c were not completely spatially resolved ; their spectra were deblended by fitting the spatial dimension at every spectral element with two 1-d gaussians plus a linear background .",
    "the two observed spectra of each star were then averaged .",
    "high resolution spectra of all three stars were obtained with hires @xcite on 1999 july 19 .",
    "the c1 decker was employed , which gives a slit 0.@xmath286 wide and 7@xmath2 long , yielding r=45,000 over 21 orders , from 5420 - 7880  with some gaps .",
    "the small separation of b and of c required attention to scattered light .",
    "hence , the image rotator was used to align the slit so that it was perpendicular to the vector separating the stars .",
    "because of the good ( 0.@xmath28 ) seeing , small slit width , and care in position of the slit , we believe that the individual spectra of b and c are uncontaminated by scattered light from the other components . a radial velocity standard , hr 6056 ( -19.9 km s@xmath8 ) , was observed immediately following the spectroscopy of hd 141569 a / b / c .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the makee package written by t. barlow ; however , equivalent widths and radial velocities were measured using the splot package in iraf .",
    "a summary of measurements of relative separation and orientation of hd  141569 a / b / c is given in table [ table_astromet ] and figure [ fig_astromet ] .",
    "the first point , from 1938 @xcite , averages four measurements of b  c and three measurements of a ",
    "b made in 1938 and 1943 . although no uncertainties were given for the measured separations and pas , we used the scatter in the measurements to estimate them .",
    "the 1998 data are from our nicmos acquisition images and the 1999 data from our palomar images .",
    "the uncertainties for the palomar positions were found from the standard deviation of many independent measurements as described in  [ photometry ] . from 1938 to 1998 , the motions of the three stars are negligible to within the uncertainties , and therefore they all have the same proper motion .",

    "this is not expected to be a stable triple system @xcite , although such young stars may not yet have had time to become unbound .",
    "the presence of three young stars unassociated with a star - forming cloud begs the question of how they formed .",
    "hd 141569 is located in projection near a complex of high latitude molecular cloud cores , mbm  34 - 39 associated with the dark clouds l169 , l183 - 4 , and l134 ( together called l134n ) .",

    "@xcite concluded , based on the strength of interstellar absorption lines toward hd 141569a , that it lies behind part of l134n / mbm 37 .",
    "however , these clouds have lsr radial velocities of 0.83.2 km s@xmath8 @xcite , compared to @xmath1720 km s@xmath8 for hd 141569a , which suggests that they are not co - moving with the star .",
    "the clouds are also quiescent and compact with internal temperatures of 3 - 12  k @xcite , which suggests that they are not undergoing protostellar collapse or being heated by nearby stars .",
    "the discovery of other young stars dispersed across the sky has prompted speculation about fast cloud dispersal mechanisms and runaway stars @xcite .",
    "one way to address the question of star formation in this region is to look for other nearby stars which may have formed at the same epoch as hd 141569 . as a first attempt to search for members of such an association ,",
    "we have queried the hipparcos catalog using the approximate characteristics of the tw hya association @xcite , a radius of 19 pc and a proper motion dispersion of 7 km s@xmath8 , which at the distance to hd 141569 correspond to a circle of radius 10  and a proper motion dispersion of @xmath169 mas  yr@xmath8 in each direction .",
    "in addition , we require the hipparcos parallaxes to agree with that of hd 141569a to within their uncertainties .",
    "this search produces 14 stars . in comparison ,",
    "a search of 20 other fields at the same absolute galactic latitude and a range of galactic longitudes produces an average of 7 @xmath6 5 stars using the same search parameters .",
    "the data suggest an overdensity of stars near hd 141569 .",
    "we note that at the distance of 100 pc , the hipparcos catalog is highly incomplete for stars fainter than v=9  mag ( later than f ) .",
    "two of the 14 stars near hd 141569 are spectral type a and lie below or along the zams ( figure [ fig_hr ] ) .",
    "this location in the hr diagram is populated by young a type stars @xcite including well known disk sources such as @xmath0 pic and hr 4796a as well as hd 141569 itself .",

    "this is within twice the velocity dispersion in the space motions of the local star formation associations such as @xmath21 chameleon , tw hya , and tucanae @xcite .",
    "so , the hd 141569 system may have formed as part of a larger episode of star formation near the sun .",
    "the pre - main sequence nature of stars b and c is confirmed by the presence of lithium in absorption . since m - type stars should be fully convective , lithium in the spectra indicates that these stars are not yet hot enough in their cores to burn it or have had insufficient time to burn all of it .",
    "the equivalent widths of 0.5  for b and c is very close to the boundary of 0.54  set by @xcite for separating weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) from post - t tauri stars .",
    "this sets an upper limit on their age of @xmath2210  myr @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath5 equivalent widths ( @xmath110 ) also argue for classifying these stars as wtts as opposed to classical tts .",
    "the strength of the double peaked h@xmath5 emission is within the distribution of chromospherically active main - sequence m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the central reversal of the line indicates a high level of chromospheric activity , which is generally associated with a variety of factors including youth and rotation . finally , @xcite classified the combined b / c spectrum as `` peculiar '' because he detected hydrogen and calcium emission lines , and pre - main - sequence stars often have such emission lines .",
    "the a / b / c system falls within the 90% confidence error circle of a rosat sky survey point - source detection .",
    "the pspc count rate of 0.093  s@xmath8 converts to an x - ray luminosity of 8.72  @xmath9  10@xmath23 erg  s@xmath8 assuming that it comes from stars at 100  pc with t - tauri - like x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the x - ray emission comes from the later - type stars , b and c rather than from the primary star .",
    "we estimate the bolometric luminosities of stars b and c as log(l / l@xmath24)=@xmath170.62 and @xmath170.95 respectively from their spectral types and j - band magnitudes using bolometric corrections from @xcite .",

    "we note that the temperature scale of @xcite gives a temperature 175  k hotter for m4  v.    shown in figure [ fig_tracks ] are tracks by @xcite with the effective temperatures and absolute j - band magnitudes of stars b and c plotted .",
    "the plotted magnitudes assume that stars b and c are at the same distance as a , 100  pc , and the uncertainties in the magnitudes correspond to the uncertainty in the hipparcos parallax to a. within the uncertainties , stars b and c appear to be the same age of 2 to 8 myr .",
    "star a is indistinguishable from the zams and is not shown on the figure .",
    "the tracks indicate masses for stars b and c of 0.5 and 0.25 m@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "tracks by other authors give the same basic result . for comparison ,",
    "figure [ fig_tracks ] also shows hr 4796b with an effective temperature of a m2.5 star from @xcite .",
    "this companion to hr 4796a , another star with a well studied circumstellar disk , was assigned an age of 8@xmath62 myr by @xcite using tracks from @xcite .",
    "the age given by the @xcite tracks is consistent with that determination and shows that hd 141569 b / c are about a factor of two younger than hr 4796b .",
    "based on all of the above arguments , we estimate an age for the hd 141569 system of 5 @xmath6 3 myr .",
    "the disk around hd 141569a has two features which suggest dynamical sculpting @xcite .",
    "first , the density of scatterers is as high at 360 au as 200 au from the star .",
    "if the companions are out of the plane of the disk , they could excite significant vertical velocities in the disk dust .",
    "second , there is a dip in surface brightness , or a `` gap '' in the disk at a radius of 250 au with a width of 60 au .",
    "no point source is seen in the gap to a limit of f110w=20.3 mag .",
    "the gap is as circular as the disk and must be cleared continually to remove particles drawn through it by radiation pressure and poynting - robertson drag . if the companion stars orbit each other and the primary and are in the plane of the disk , their center of mass is 1053 au from the primary .",
    "the 29:1 lindblad resonances between the orbital period of the companion center of mass and orbiting particles in the disk are shown with the dashed ellipses on figure [ fig_astromet ] .",
    "there is no obvious agreement between the resonances and the structure observed in the disk , even if the companions are assumed to be somewhat out of the plane and so the resonances shifted .",
    "the resonances closest to the gap lie at 243 au ( 9:1 ) and 263 au ( 8:1 ) from the star .",
    "it is not clear , however , why only these high order resonances and not any of the others would mold the disk . if the companions were in very eccentric orbits and currently near apastron , the locations of the resonances might change dramatically with time .",
    "however , the circularity of the gap implies a stable dynamical influence over long time periods .",
    "on the basis of common proper motion , common radial velocity and the low probability of a chance superposition of three young stars away from any known star - forming cloud , we conclude that hd 141569 a / b / c form a physical association which may or may not be bound .",
    "the age of the stars as determined from spectroscopic features , x - ray emission , and placement on pre - main sequence tracks is 5 myr .",
    "at least two other stars , hd 141693 and hd 140574 , may be members of this common proper motion group .",
    "hd 141569 has a now well studied disk with grains present from 25  500 au of the star .",
    "the inferred size of the grains , @xmath15 @xmath27 m @xcite , means that radiation pressure blows them away in at least an order of magnitude less time than our derived stellar age .",
    "thus , they must be continuously regenerated , probably through collisions of larger bodies .",
    "the timescales for the formation of planetesimal cores is 10@xmath28 - 10@xmath29 yr @xcite which is easily consistent with the age of the system . from measurements of co around hd 141569 , the remnant mass of h@xmath30",
    "is estimated as 20 to 460 m@xmath31 @xcite , so any gas giants present must have formed very quickly .",
    "the morphology of the disk , including a gap at 250 au , indicates the presence of dynamical sculpting .",
    "resonant interactions between the companions and the disk do not appear to account for the structure , and it would be hard given current models of planet formation to generate jupiter sized bodies in a disk of such young age at distances so far from the central star @xcite .",
    "the cause of the structure in the disk thus remains unknown .",
