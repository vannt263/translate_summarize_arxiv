    "since the fundamental work of stieltjes and chebyshev , among others , in the 19@xmath0 century , orthogonal polynomials ( ops ) have been an essential tool in the analysis of basic problems in mathematics and engineering .",
    "for example , moment problems , numerical quadrature , rational and polynomial approximation and interpolation , linear algebra , and all the direct or indirect applications of these techniques in engineering are all indebted to the basic properties of ops .",
    "mostly orthogonality has been considered on the complex unit circle or on ( a subset of ) the real line .",
    "orthogonal rational functions ( orfs ) were first introduced by drbaian in the 1960s .",
    "most of his papers appeared in russian literature , but an accessible survey in english can be found in  @xcite .",

    "other rational generalizations can be found in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "further , we refer to  @xcite and to  @xcite for the use of these orfs in respectively numerical quadrature and system identification , while several results about matrix - valued orfs can be found in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "of course , many of the classical ops are not defined with respect to a measure on the whole unit circle or the whole real line .",

    "in which this subset is a real half - line or an interval , we refer to  @xcite and  @xcite respectively , while some computational aspects have been dealt with in e.g.  @xcite .    by shifting",
    "the recurrence coefficients in the recurrence relation for ops and orfs , the so - called associated polynomials ( aps ) and associated rational functions ( arfs ) respectively are obtained .",
    "arfs on a subset of the real line have been studied in  @xcite as a rational generalization of aps ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , while aps on the complex unit circle , on the other hand , have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "however , so far nothing is known about arfs on the complex unit circle , and hence , the main purpose of this paper is to generalize  @xcite to the case of rational functions , following the ideas developed by professor franz peherstorfer .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . after giving the necessary theoretical background in section  [ sec : pre ] , in section  [ sec : fsk ] we recall some basic properties of orfs on the complex unit circle and their so - called functions of the second kind .",
    "although these properties are basic , they are partially new in the sense that we prove them in a more general context . next , in section",
    "[ sec : nc ] we use these orfs and their functions of the second kind to define a new class of orfs on the complex unit circle .",

    "the standard choice is @xmath21 , but in this paper @xmath20 will be free .",
    "the reason is that , even if we choose @xmath21 for the orthogonal rational functions , the corresponding associated rational functions involve a shift in the poles so that the related sequence @xmath22 starts at some @xmath23 which is not necessarily zero .",
