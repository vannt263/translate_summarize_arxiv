    "compact stellar objects are subdivided into three groups : usual neutron stars ( having only hadronic matter interiors and an extended crust ) , hybrid stars ( with quark core , hadronic shell and a crust similar to that in neutron stars ) and strange stars ( hypothetical self - bound objects composed of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 quark matter with only a thin crust if any ) .",
    "the possibility of strange stars has been extensively discussed in the literature , see @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are among the most intriguing phenomena in the universe , see @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "if the energy is emitted isotropically , an energy release of the order of @xmath11 to @xmath12  erg is needed to power the grb .",
    "however , there is now compelling evidence that the gamma ray emission is not isotropic , but displays a jet - like geometry . in the case of beaming a smaller energy , of the order of @xmath13  erg , would be sufficient to power the grb @xcite .",
    "although typically one may speak about a short grb with a time scale @xmath14 to @xmath15s and a long grb with a time scale @xmath16 to @xmath17   s , energies , durations , time scales involved in a burst , pulse shape structures , sub - burst numbers , etc , vary so much that it is hard to specify a typical grb .",
    "many scenarios for the grb have been proposed : the `` collapsar '' , or `` hypernova '' model linking the grb with ultra - bright type ibc supernovae ( hypernovae ) and the subsequent black hole formation @xcite ; neutron star mergers @xcite , or accretion of matter onto a black hole ; strange star collisions @xcite ; the model @xcite assuming a large surface magnetic field up to @xmath18  g of a millisecond pulsar produced in the collapse of a @xmath19 g white dwarf , with a powerful pulsar wind , as the source of the grb ; the model @xcite suggesting a @xmath20 plasma wind between heated neutron stars in close binary systems as consequence of the @xmath21 annihilation ; the model @xcite of a steadily accreting @xmath22 g white dwarf collapse to a millisecond pulsar with a @xmath23  g interior toroidal field , causing the grb ; an ( isotropic ) first order phase transition @xcite of a pure hadronic compact star to a strange star ( see also @xcite ) ; asymmetric core combustion @xcite in neutron stars due to the influence of the magnetic field generating an acceleration of the flame in the polar direction , etc .",
    "pulsars are rotating neutron stars with rather high magnetic fields causing observable radio dipole signals .",
    "most of the known pulsars are born in the neighborhood of the galactic plane and move away from it with natal kick velocities which are typically higher than those of their progenitors @xcite .",
    "this implies that the birth process of pulsars also produces their high velocities and thus can not be entirely isotropic @xcite . up to now , the mechanisms driving this asymmetry are far from clear .",
    "there are several hypotheses , ranging from asymmetric supernova explosions @xcite , neutron star instabilities @xcite and magneto - rotational effects @xcite to the model of an electromagnetic or neutrino rocket @xcite .",
    "it is also not clarified whether the distribution of pulsar kick velocities is bimodal with a low - velocity component of @xmath24 ( 20 % of the known objects ) and a high - velocity component of @xmath25 ( 80% ) as suggested by @xcite or whether it can be explained by a one - component distribution @xcite .",
    "most of the models are capable of explaining kick velocities of @xmath26 , but it is a nontrivial problem to explain the highest measured pulsar velocities around @xmath27 .    in this work",
    "we assume that a strongly magnetized strange star has been formed in the color superconducting color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) state with a large gap @xmath28 , @xmath29  mev , cf .",
    "@xcite , as the result of a phase transition .",
    "the latter could be caused by the accretion of the matter from a companion star , the neutron star angular momentum decrease owing to the gravitational and electromagnetic radiation after the supernova event had occurred , or during the collapse of a magnetized white dwarf to the neutron star state , the proto - neutron star collapse to the new stable state , or by some other reason .",
    "we also can deal with a hybrid star instead of the strange star .",
    "however , cf .",
    "@xcite , there is experimental evidence that the grb carries only a tiny baryon load of mass @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the hadronic shell and the crust should be rather thin or there should be a special reason for a low baryon loading .",
    "we suggest to explain the beaming by the presence of a strong magnetic field . _",
    "thus the beaming and the low baryon loading stimulate us to conjecture about a magnetized strange star , _ which has a tiny hadron shell , if any , and only a thin crust . varying the value of the surface magnetic field @xmath31 , we search for an optimal configuration to explain the grb characteristics and to estimate a range of velocities of the star kicks .",
    "we use units @xmath32 .",
    "* vortex structures in the cfl phase of the strange star in the magnetic field .",
    "* let us further assume that the bulk of the star is in the cfl phase with no hadronic shell and a tiny crust generating a surface magnetic field which may achieve the values @xmath33 .",
    "then , one may expect by flux conservation that the inner magnetic field ( at the crust - core interface ) @xmath34 can reach the values @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the corresponding densities at the surface and in the core , respectively . below we will vary @xmath38 within the interval @xmath39  g. from the bcs relation the critical temperature of the superconductivity is @xmath40 and the temperature dependent gap can be parameterized as @xcite @xmath41^{0.53}$ ] . for initial temperatures",
    "@xmath42mev and the gap @xmath29  mev we have @xmath43 .",
    "thus the strange star is formed in the superconducting phase .",
    "refs . @xcite",
    "have shown , that typical values of the ginzburg - landau parameter for color superconductors are @xmath44 .",
    "the coherence length @xmath45 and penetration depth @xmath46 for cfl matter can be estimated in the weak coupling limit as @xmath47 where we used the above @xmath28 dependence . in our case",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath48 , and the quark chemical potential is @xmath49mev .",
    "the critical ginzburg - landau parameter is @xmath50 distinguishes between type i ( @xmath51 ) and type ii ( @xmath52 ) superconductors .",
    "then for @xmath53 we deal with a type ii superconductor .",
    "the latter entails the existence of a mixed phase ( normal vortices embedded in superconducting matter ) for @xmath54 in a broad interval of magnetic fields @xmath55 .",
    "the value @xmath56 is @xmath57 , with @xmath58  g for @xmath0  mev .",
    "actually , even if @xmath59 , the magnetic field , in spite of the meissner effect , can not be expelled from the star interior within a pulsar lifetime @xcite , thus being concentrated in vortices aligned along the magnetic axis ( feasibly being parallel to the rotation axis ) .",
    "therefore , the mixed state exists for all @xmath60 . making below only rough estimates we will assume the simplest abrikosov vortex structure of the mixed phase .",
    "due to magnetic flux conservation the number of vortices in the strange star interior is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 with the magnetic flux quantum @xmath63g@xmath64 and the star radius @xmath65  km @xcite .",
    "superconductivity is expelled from the vortex interior , @xmath66 , where the matter is in the state of a strongly magnetized quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the magnetic field decreases on the scale of the penetration depth @xmath67 as @xmath68 , for @xmath69 , cf .",
    "typical values of the magnetic field in the vortex center are @xmath70 g , depending on @xmath67 .    in hadronic matter and in metals ,",
    "the pairing gap is rather small and the coherence length @xmath71 is larger than the debye screening length .",
    "therefore , charge neutrality is easily fulfilled for @xmath66 . in the quark matter case",
    "we have opposite situation @xcite . for both , quarks and electrons , @xmath72 with typical values of @xmath73 .",
    "the presence of the coulomb field diminishes the difference between the chemical potentials of quarks of different species since one does not need to fulfill the charge neutrality condition locally at distances @xmath74 but rather globally at @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that the cylindrical volume within distances @xmath76 from the vortex center is possibly filled by a 2sc+s phase plus a normal phase @xcite , also characterized by a still rather high magnetic field @xmath77  g. in case of the two - flavor superconducting ( 2sc ) phase quarks of two colors , e.g. , green and red , are paired with a large gap , whereas blue quarks are unpaired or paired with only a small gap @xmath78  mev @xcite .",
    "the 2sc+s phase emits neutrinos with a still high rate of about 1/3 of the emissivity of normal quark matter . in this phase at densities under consideration typical values of the electron fraction @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are electron and baryon densities , are @xmath82 ( for @xmath83 ) . the electron fraction in the cfl phase at @xmath84 vanishes @xcite , but at finite temperatures @xmath85 due to thermal @xmath20 excitations .",
    "the typical distance between vortices is @xmath86 the region near the magnetic vortex , where the magnetic field decreases by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the central value @xmath87 , has the volume @xmath88 the fraction of the total vortex volume @xmath89 ( @xmath90 is the total number of vortices , @xmath91 is the star volume ) varies from several @xmath92 to several @xmath93 for @xmath38 from @xmath94  g to @xmath95  g , respectively .",
    "therefore the condition @xmath96 is safely fulfilled .",
    "* goldstone transport*. the cfl ( and mcfl ) phase is also characterized by the presence of ( almost ) massless weakly interacting goldstone excitations ( like phonons ) . for @xmath97 mev of our interest",
    "the mean free path of goldstones is much shorter than the star radius @xmath98 km , cf .",
    "@xcite , and the typical time of their transport to the surface is very large . in the presence of a strong magnetic field",
    "generating vortices goldstones can not pass from cfl matter to the 2sc+s matter and to the normal quark matter phase of the vortex core , where they can not exist .",
    "thus , the mean free path of goldstone excitations @xmath99 in presence of vortices is still much shorter than in a homogeneous cfl strange star matter . for magnetic fields of our interest one",
    "finds @xmath100 fm .",
    "thus goldstones may efficiently equilibrate the temperature between the vortex interior and exterior regions .",
    "* neutrino radiation and beaming*. the emissivity of the quark direct urca ( qdu ) process in normal quark matter in absence of the magnetic field is very high @xcite @xmath101 correspondingly , the neutrino mean free path in normal quark matter becomes very short @xmath102 for @xmath103 one @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the compression .    in superfluid matter",
    "the suppression factor of the emissivity is roughly @xcite @xmath107 and the enhancement factor of the mean free path is then @xmath108 . in the cfl phase @xmath109 but there exist thermal @xmath20 excitations",
    ". then @xmath110 should be replaced by @xmath111 and we may use above expressions ( including approrpiate suppression and enhancement factors ) with @xmath112 .",
    "the emissivity remains virtually unaltered in the presence of a magnetic field when many landau levels are occupied @xcite and it is increased by @xmath113 times if only the first landau level is filled .",
    "however , the latter occurs only for @xmath114  g. with the field values which we have assumed this condition is satisfied only in the region of the vortex cores , @xmath66 , of a tiny volume . in the remaining part of the vortex volume @xmath115 ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) one can roughly neglect the influence of the magnetic field on eq .",
    "( [ qdu ] ) .",
    "also multiplying ( [ qdu ] ) by a factor @xmath118 we may estimate the emissivity of the 2sc+s + normal phase since due to the pairing in the 2sc phase the contribution of the red and green quarks is exponentially suppressed according ( [ supp ] ) .",
    "also in the region between the vortices occupied by cfl phase with the volume @xmath119 , the emissivity of the direct urca process is suppressed by ( [ supp ] ) .",
    "the neutrino mean free path increased by this factor exceeds the radius of the star for temperatures below @xmath120 mev ( for @xmath121  mev ) , whereas for the normal quark matter one gets @xmath122 few mev , cf .",
    "@xcite . for higher gaps the value @xmath123 still increases .",
    "for @xmath124 the heat transport is governed by the transport equation , @xmath125 , @xmath126 is the total specific heat of the matter and @xmath127 is the total heat conductivity . since goldstones ( phonons ) are efficiently captured by vortices one has @xmath128 , and thus @xmath129 .",
    "a typical time scale for the energy transport to the surface is @xmath130 . since @xmath131 ,",
    "the energy transport time is @xmath132 . using the above value @xmath133 for @xmath134mev",
    ", we get @xmath135s ( estimate is done for @xmath136  mev ) .",
    "for that time the star essentially losses its initial thermal energy .",
    "if initially ( for @xmath137  mev , @xmath0  mev ) the thermal energy is mainly concentrated in massless excitations , the energy falls by a factor @xmath138 for @xmath139mev .",
    "after the transport time @xmath140",
    "the cfl regions become transparent for neutrinos .    for @xmath141 ,",
    "the prominent difference between the neutrino mean free path in the 2sc+s+normal matter on the one hand and the cfl quark matter on the other hand leads to anisotropic neutrino emission via the direct ( no rescatterings ) qdu reaction from the star within a cone of the temperature - dependent opening angle @xmath142 around the magnetic axis , where @xmath143 .",
    "thus after @xmath144 the star begins to radiate the remaining energy @xmath145  erg within a narrow beam cone .",
    "* cooling evolution .",
    "numerical results*. the cooling evolution for @xmath146 within the opening angle can be described by inverting the solution of @xmath147 where @xmath148~\\zeta_{du}+ s { n_{vo}v_{vo}}/{v}\\ } c_v^q(t)+c_v^{ex}(t),\\ ] ] @xmath149 is the specific heat of the normal quark matter and @xmath150 is the contribution of ( almost ) massless goldstone excitations and electrons and positrons ( for the effective value of the degeneracy factor @xmath151 , we have assumed @xmath152 for the velocity of goldstones , the maximum fermi velocity for relativistic fermi liquids . if @xmath153 were @xmath154 , we would get @xmath155 . ) .",

    "the isotropic luminosity is @xmath157 we take the electron fraction @xmath158 for the 2sc+s + normal phase and a thermally produced electron fraction @xmath159 for the cfl phase .    here",
    "the goldstones play an essential role since they rapidly ( in a microscopic time ) equilibrate the temperature between the vortices ( of volume @xmath160 ) and their surrounding . in eq .",
    "( [ timecool ] ) we neglected this very short time assuming an instantaneous heat transport from the hotter cfl regions of vortex exteriors to the regions of the vortex volume which then cool down by the direct neutrino radiation within the beaming angle .",
    "results for the time evolution of neutrino luminosity , temperature and the neutrino beaming angle are shown in fig .",
    "they demonstrate the effect of the cooling delay due to neutrino beaming in a strong magnetic field . for gaps",
    "@xmath161 mev and @xmath162 g we get @xmath163 grad and the energy @xmath145  erg that remained in the star after the neutrino transport era has passed is radiated in the beam during several @xmath164  s. decreasing further the magnetic field one would get increase of the opening angle @xmath165 angle finally yielding inappropriate smearing of the beaming . for @xmath166",
    "g we obtain a narrow beam , @xmath167 grad , and the initial star energy is radiated in the beam during several seconds .",
    "* neutrino energy conversion to photons , grb*. the neutrino / antineutrino collisions produce @xmath20 pairs outside the star , which efficiently convert to photons .",
    "we use the result of @xcite for the @xmath168 conversion rate : @xmath169 to estimate that for a surface temperature @xmath170   mev most of the initial thermal energy can be converted in @xmath20 for an appropriate short time step @xmath171s .",
    "the advantage of the strange star model is that the strange star has a thin hadron shell and a tiny crust , if any . in this case",
    "we may assume that the surface temperature is of the same order of magnitude as the internal temperature .",
    "note that in the presence of beaming already @xmath172erg produced on a time scale @xmath173s could be sufficient to explain grb .",
    "thus , above estimates are very optimistic for the grb model dealing with a magnetized quark star , if @xmath174mev .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 pairs are accelerated in the strong magnetic field of the strange star exterior , increasing the hard component of the @xmath175 ray spectrum , in coincidence with experimental findings .",
    "* range of kick velocities*. parity non - conservation in the weak interaction neutrino induced direct processes in presence of a magnetic field leads to a violation of reflection symmetry since the neutrino flux is a polar vector while the magnetic field is an axial one .",
    "the magnitude of this asymmetry has been estimated considering different reactions in neutron stars as the modified urca reaction @xcite , see also @xcite ; @xmath176 decays on the pion condensate @xcite ; formation and breaking of nucleon pairs @xcite ; coherent neutrino electron scattering on nuclei @xcite ; neutrino - polarized neutron elastic scattering ; polarized electron capture @xcite ; the @xmath177 process @xcite ; the reaction @xmath178 ; etc .",
    "some of these reactions produce an asymmetry factor up to @xmath179 , where @xmath180 g. in our case of the strange star in the cfl phase with a strong magnetic field the direct qdu process and formation and breaking of quark pairs are relevant as well as the reaction @xmath178 near the star surface . here",
    "we assume that the qdu processes for @xmath181 within the beaming angle ( in accordance with the no go theorem @xcite ) produce an asymmetry factor of the same order of magnitude as has been estimated in the literature .",
    "this @xmath182 factor then leads to a net momentum transfer from the neutrino flux to the star of mass @xmath183 resulting in a time - dependent kick velocity @xmath184 which saturates at the magnetic field dependent asymptotic value @xmath185 as soon as the beaming ceases .",
    "numerical results are shown in fig .",

    "g , the early cooling evolution of strange stars with a color superconducting quark matter core in the cfl phase right after a short transport era is characterized by anisotropic neutrino emission , collimated within a beaming angle @xmath165 around the magnetic axis . initial temperatures of the order of @xmath192mev allow for the energy release @xmath193  erg .",

    "the range of strange star kick velocities is thereby in a qualitative agreement with recent observational data on pulsar kick velocity distribution .",
    "all our estimates are very rough and essentially vary with the parameters of the model .",
