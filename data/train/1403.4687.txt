    "when feynman discussed the two - path interferometer in his famous lectures @xcite , he noted that quantum systems ( quantons ) display the behavior of both waves and particles and that there is a sort of competition between seeing the wave behavior versus the particle behavior . that is",
    ", when the observer tries harder to figure out which path of the interferometer the quanton takes , the wave - like interference becomes less visible .",
    "this tradeoff is commonly called wave - particle duality ( wpd ) .",
    "feynman further noted that this is `` a phenomenon which is impossible ... to explain in any classical way , and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics .",
    "in reality , it contains the only mystery [ of quantum mechanics ] . ''    many quantitative statements of this idea , so - called wave - particle duality relations ( wpdrs ) , have been formulated @xcite .",
    "such relations typically consider the mach - zehnder interferometer for single photons , see fig .",
    "[ fgrmz ] .",
    "for example , a well - known formulation proven independently by englert @xcite and jaeger et al .",
    "@xcite quantifies the wave behavior by fringe visibility @xmath0 , and particle behavior by the distinguishability of the photon s path , @xmath1 .",
    "( see below for precise definitions ; the idea is that `` waves '' have a definite phase , while `` particles '' have a definite location , hence @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively quantify how definite the phase and location are inside the interferometer . )",
    "they found the tradeoff : @xmath2 which implies @xmath3 when @xmath4 ( full particle behavior means no wave behavior ) and vice - versa , and also treats the intermediate case of partial distinguishability .",
    "it has been debated , particularly around the mid-1990 s @xcite , whether the wpd principle , closely related to bohr s complementarity principle @xcite , is equivalent to another fundamental quantum idea with no classical analog : heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite . the latter states that there are certain pairs of observables , such as position and momentum or two orthogonal components of spin angular momentum , that can not simultaneously be known or jointly measured .",
    "likewise there are many quantitative statements of this idea , known as uncertainty relations ( urs )  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and modern formulations typically use entropy instead of standard deviation as the uncertainty measure , so - called entropic uncertainty relations ( eurs ) @xcite .",
    "this is because the standard deviation formulation suffers from trivial bounds when applied to finite - dimensional systems @xcite , whereas the entropic formulation not only fixes this weakness but also implies the standard deviation relation @xcite and has relevance to information - processing tasks .",
    "at present the debate regarding wave - particle duality and uncertainty remains unresolved , to our knowledge . yet",
    "feynman s quote seems to suggest a belief that quantum mechanics has but one mystery and not two separate ones . in this article",
    "we confirm this belief by showing a quantitative connection between urs and wpdrs , demonstrating that urs and wpdrs capture the same underlying physics ; see also @xcite for some partial progress along these lines .",
    "this may come as a surprise , since englert @xcite originally argued that `` does not make use of heisenberg s uncertainty relation in any form '' . to be fair ,",
    "the uncertainty relation that we show is equivalent to was not known at the time of englert s paper , and was only recently discovered @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will consider eurs , where the particular entropies that are relevant to are the so - called min- and max - entropies used in cryptography @xcite .    in",
    "what follows we provide a general framework for deriving and discussing wpdrs - a framework that is ultimately based on the entropic uncertainty principle .",
    "we illustrate our framework by showing that several different wpdrs from the literature are in fact particular examples of eurs . making",
    "this connection not only unifies two fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics , but also implies that novel wpdrs can be derived simply by applying already - proven eurs .",
    "indeed we use our framework to derive a novel wpdr for an exotic scenario involving a `` quantum beam splitter '' @xcite , where testing our wpdr would allow the experimenter to verify the beam splitter s quantum coherence ( see  ) .     and",
    "@xmath5 , at time @xmath6 , then the system interacts with an environment @xmath7 . finally at time",
    "@xmath8 a phase shift @xmath9 is applied to the lower arm and the two beams are recombined on a second beam splitter .",
    "( while this is the typical setup , our framework also allows @xmath10 to play a more general role , e.g. , being correlated to the photon before it enters the mzi . )",
    "our complementary guessing game proceeds as follows . in one game",
    "( colored red ) alice tries to guess which of the two paths the photon took given that she has access to a portion of @xmath10 denoted @xmath11 , which could be , e.g. , a gas of atoms whose internal states record information about the presence of a photon . in the other game ( colored blue ) , one of two phases , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , is randomly applied to the lower interferometer arm and alice tries to guess @xmath9 given that she has access to a different portion of @xmath10 denoted @xmath14 , which could be , e.g. , the photon s polarisation .",
    "we argue that wpdrs impose fundamental trade - offs on alice s ability to win these two games .",

    "[ fgrmz ] , this corresponds to either guessing which path the photon took , or which phase was applied inside the interferometer .",

    "binary _ , we mean any interferometer where there are only two interfering paths , i.e. , all other paths are classically distinguishable ( from each other and from the two interfering paths ) .",
    "in addition to the mzi , this includes as special cases , e.g. , the franson interferometer @xcite ( see fig .  [ fgrfran ] ) and the double slit interferometer ( see fig .  [ fgrds ] ) . note that binary interferometers go beyond interferometers with two physical paths .",
    "for example , in the franson interferometer there are four possible paths but post - selecting on coincidence counts discards two of these paths , which are irrelevant to the interference anyway .    ,",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 with @xmath18 = short path , @xmath19 = long path .",
    "two of these dimensions are post - selected away by considering only coincidence counts , i.e. , the photons arriving at the same time is inconsistent with the @xmath15 and @xmath16 paths . the remaining paths , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are indistinguishable in the special case of perfect visibility and they produce interference fringes as one varies @xmath22 .",
    "namely , the intensity of coincidence counts at detector pair ( @xmath23 ) oscillates with @xmath9 .",
    "interaction with an environment system , or making the beam splitters asymmetric , may allow one to partially distinguish between @xmath24 and @xmath17 , and our entropic uncertainty framework can be applied to derive a tradeoff , e.g. , of the form of .",
    "this tradeoff captures the idea that alice can either guess which path ( @xmath24 vs.  @xmath17 ) or which phase ( @xmath25 vs.  @xmath26 ) , but she can not do both ( even if she extracts information from other systems @xmath11 and @xmath14 ) . [ fgrfran ] ]    _ _ particle observable.__now we link wave and particle behavior to knowledge of complementary observables . in the case of particle behavior ,",
    "the intuition is that particles have a well - defined spatial location , hence `` particleness '' should be connected to knowledge of the path inside interferometer . for binary interferometers , there may be more than two physical paths but only two of these are interfering .",
    "hence we only consider the two - dimensional subspace associated with the two which - path states of interest , denoted @xmath27 and @xmath5 .",
    "this subspace can be thought of as an effective qubit , denoted @xmath28 , and the standard basis of this qubit : @xmath29 corresponds precisely to the which - path observable .",
    "for example , in the double slit ( fig .",
    "[ fgrds ] ) , @xmath27 and @xmath5 are the pure states that one would obtain at the slit exit from blocking the bottom and top slits respectively .    _",
    "_ wave observable.__wave behavior is traditionally associated with having a large amplitude of intensity oscillations at the interferometer output .",
    "indeed this has been quantified by the so - called _ fringe visibility _ , see , but to apply the uncertainty principle we need to relate wave behavior to an observable inside the interferometer .",
    "classical waves ( e.g. , water waves ) are often modelled as having a _ well - defined phase _ and being spatially _",
    "delocalized_. the analog in our context corresponds to the quanton being in a equally - weighted superposition of which - path states .",
    "hence eigenstates of the `` wave observable '' should live in the @xmath30 plane of the bloch sphere , so we consider observables on qubit @xmath28 ( the interfering subspace ) of the form @xmath31 in terms of the guessing game , guessing the value of the wave ( or which - phase ) observable corresponds to guessing whether a phase of @xmath12 or @xmath32 was applied inside the interferometer ( see , e.g. , fig  [ fgrmz ] ) .",
    "while @xmath33 is a generic phase , its precise value will be singled out by the particular experimental setup .",
    "when the experimenter measures fringe visibility this corresponds to varying @xmath33 to find the largest intensity contrast , and mathematically we model this by minimizing the uncertainty within the @xmath30 plane , see .",
    "our entropic view associates a kind of behavior with the availability of a kind of information , or lack of behavior with missing information , as follows :    [ eq : partwave ] @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the min- and max - entropies , defined below in , which are commonly used in quantum information theory , @xmath37 is the which - path observable in , @xmath38 is the which - phase observable in ( whose uncertainty we optimize over the @xmath30 plane of the bloch sphere ) , and @xmath11 and @xmath14 are some other quantum systems that contain information and measuring these systems may help to reveal the behavior ( e.g. , @xmath11 could be a which - path detector and @xmath14 could be the quanton s internal degree of freedom ) .",
    "note that we use the same symbols ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . ) for the observables as for the random variables they give rise to .",
    "full behavior ( no behavior ) of some kind corresponds to the associated entropy in being zero ( one ) .",
    "we formulate our general wpdr as @xmath39 this states that , for a binary interferometer , the sum of the ignorances about the particle and wave behaviors is lower bounded by 1 ( i.e. , 1 bit ) .",
    "constrains alice s ability to win the complementary guessing game described above .",
    "if measuring @xmath11 allows her to guess the quanton s path , i.e. , the min - entropy in is small , then even if she measures @xmath14 she still will not be able to guess the quanton s phase , i.e. , the max - entropy in will be large ( and vice - versa ) .     that has interacted with , and hence may contain information about , the quanton . in the second game ( colored blue ) , bob randomly chooses the source s vertical coordinate , and alice tries to guess where the source was located , given some other system @xmath14 and given where the quanton was finally detected .",
    "note that the source s location determines the relative phase between the which - slit states , @xmath27 and @xmath5 , and we assume bob chooses one of two possible locations such that the relative phase is either @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "here , the state @xmath27 ( @xmath5 ) is defined as the pure state at the slit exit that one would obtain from blocking the bottom ( top ) slit .",
    "our framework provides a wpdr that constrains alice s ability to win these complementary games .",
    "furthermore , one can reinterpret the probability to win the second game , for the case where @xmath14 is trivial , in terms of the traditional fringe visibility .",
    "the latter quantifies the amplitude of intensity oscillations as one varies the detector location @xmath42 .",
    "note that varying @xmath42 changes the relative path lengths from the slits to the detector and hence is analogous to applying a relative phase @xmath9 between the two paths .",
    "[ this assumes that the envelope function ( dashed curve ) associated with the interference pattern is flat over the range of @xmath42 values considered , which is often the case when @xmath19 is very large .",
    "] so the double slit fringe visibility is equivalent to the notion captured by @xmath0 in , where the detector is spatially fixed but a phase is varied , and we relate @xmath0 to our entropic measure of wave behavior in the methods section .

    "the usefulness of for cryptography is due to the clear operational meanings of the min- and max - entropies @xcite , which naturally express the monogamy of correlations as they give the distances to being uncorrelated ( @xmath36 ) and being perfectly correlated ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "one can replace these entropies with the von neumann entropy in and the relation still holds ; however , the min- and max - entropies give more refined statements about information processing since they are also applicable to finite numbers of experiments . from  @xcite ,",
    "the precise definitions of these entropies , for a generic classical - quantum state @xmath43 , are    [ eq : minmaxabsdef ] @xmath44    where all logarithms are base 2 in this article . here",

    "also , @xmath48 quantifies the secrecy of @xmath46 from @xmath47 , as measured by the fidelity @xmath49 of @xmath43 to a state that is completely uncorrelated .",
    "the fact that can be thought of as a wpdr , and furthermore that it encompasses the majority of wpdrs found in the literature for binary interferometers , is our main result .",
    "to illustrate this , we consider the celebrated mzi , shown in fig .  [ fgrmz ] , since most literature wpdrs have been formulated for this interferometer . in",
    "the simplest case one sends in a single photon towards a 50/50 ( i.e. , symmetric ) beam splitter , @xmath50 , which results in the state @xmath51 , then a phase @xmath9 is applied to the lower arm giving the state @xmath52 .",
    "finally the two paths are recombined on a second 50/50 beam splitter @xmath53 and the output modes are detected by detectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
