    "in recent years the study of light radioactive nuclei @xcite has intensified due to the significant progress made with radioactive beam facilities .",
    "it has led to a decrease of interest in the study of light stable nuclei such as @xmath15li and @xmath16be .",
    "it has been shown that in light nuclei the nucleons tend to group into clusters , the relative motion of which defines to a large extent the properties of these nuclei .",
    "consequently , the cluster structure of their ground as well as low - lying excited states became the focus of theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "for example , @xmath17li and @xmath18li nuclei are both well described by the two - body cluster models ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ) .",
    "due to its borromean structure , a special attention has been focused on the @xmath16be nucleus which may be considered as a nuclear system with the following two - body configurations : @xmath13be+@xmath11 or @xmath14he+@xmath12 .",
    "the breakup of @xmath2be via @xmath10be@xmath9 has been measured for many of the low - lying excited states of @xmath2be @xcite . however , the breakup branching via the first - excited 2@xmath21 state of @xmath10be and via @xmath5he remained uncertain .",
    "the three - body configuration ( @xmath22 ) of @xmath2be may have a significant astrophysical interest .",
    "the short lifetimes of @xmath10be@xmath9 , the first - excited state of @xmath10be and @xmath5he@xmath9 suggest that the sequential capture of a neutron or an @xmath12 particle is very unlikely .",
    "the formalism used to derive the ( @xmath22 ) rate by grigorenko  @xcite also suggested that any broad intermediate resonances will have little effect on the ( @xmath22 ) rate .",
    "however , according to another theoretical calculation @xcite the stellar reaction rate for this reaction proceeding via the @xmath5he@xmath9 channel is significant for the formation of @xmath2be .    in the measurement @xcite of the @xmath2be(@xmath8li,@xmath8li@xmath12)@xmath23 reaction it was unambiguously established for the first time that the @xmath2be excited states around 6.5 and 11.3 mev decay into the @xmath24he channel .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the structure of @xmath2be was discussed in the frame of isobaric analogue states of @xmath2b .",
    "charity et al .",
    "@xcite found that the decay of @xmath25b has the dominant branch @xmath12+@xmath26li implying that  the corresponding mirror state in @xmath16be would be expected to decay through the mirror channel @xmath12+@xmath14he , instead of through the @xmath11+@xmath13be(2@xmath21 ) channel the mirror state of @xmath2be at 2.429 mev is also reported to decay by @xmath12 emission \" . in this case",
    "it would decay to the unstable ground state of @xmath5he producing the @xmath11 + 2@xmath12 final state . on the contrary , another experimental work  @xcite claimed that this state decays almost exclusively by @xmath11 emission to the unstable first - excited state of @xmath10be .",
    "the excited states of @xmath2be have been populated in various ways including among others @xmath27-decay @xcite .",
    "most experiments confirm that the 2.429 mev state has a branching ratio to the @xmath10be@xmath9+@xmath11 channel of only @xmath287% @xcite , but could not determine whether the remaining strength was in the @xmath10be(@xmath29)+@xmath11 or the @xmath5he+@xmath12 channel .",
    "however , it was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ratio 2:1 could be assigned for the two channels , respectively .    the results of refs .",
    "@xcite along with the qualitative breakup data discussed above suggest the necessity of obtaining quantitative branching - ratio data for the low - lying states in the borromean nucleus @xmath2be .",
    "the present experiment was designed to study the breakup of @xmath2be in the attempt to determine the contribution of @xmath5he+@xmath12 and @xmath11+@xmath10be channels .",
    "our data are based on inclusive measurements , whereas the experimental results of refs .",
    "@xcite were obtained in exclusive measurements .",
    "the exclusive measurements require fully defined kinematics with complicated detector systems allowing the complete reconstruction and identification of the breakup event .",
    "the inclusive measurements , in spite of their simplicity , may also be useful in the study of clustering phenomena .",
    "for example , in our recent paper  @xcite the obtained large value of the deformation parameter might be considered as the confirmation of the cluster structure of the low - lying states of @xmath2be .",
    "however , the inclusive measurement did not allow us to give unambiguous preference to one of the possible configurations , e.g. ( @xmath12+@xmath12+@xmath11 ) or ( @xmath12+@xmath14he ) .",
    "another purpose of the present study was the attempt to find the cluster structure ( for instance , @xmath5he ) and how the cluster structure influences the nuclear reaction mechanism .    indeed , dtraz et al .",
    "@xcite argued that multi - particle - multi - hole structures are expected to occur at rather low excitation energies in nuclei .",
    "therefore , four - nucleon transfer reactions have been extensively studied .",
    "it is hoped that the major features of such reactions , in spite of the a priori complexity of such a transfer , may be understood assuming that the nucleons are transferred as a whole , i.e. strongly correlated in the cluster which has the internal quantum numbers of a free @xmath12-particle .",
    "whether one or several internal configurations of the transferred fragments contribute to the transition amplitudes of these transfer reactions is both a crucial and difficult question to address . in the present study",
    ", we tried to examine how , for instance , two protons and two neutrons merged into an @xmath12-cluster are transferred .",
    "the angular distributions of the @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath8be)@xmath5he and @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath7li)@xmath7li reaction channels were scrupulously measured at the energy of 60 mev for the transitions to the ground states of @xmath5he and @xmath7li by rudchik et al .",
    "the experimental data were analysed using the coupled reaction channels ( crc ) model including one- and two - step cluster transfer and cluster spectroscopic amplitudes calculated in the framework of the translation - invariant shell model .",
    "it was concluded that the cluster transfer is unimportant : in the @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath8be)@xmath5he reaction channel the @xmath12-transfer dominates only at small angles while the transfer of two neutrons dominates at large angles .",
    "nevertheless , the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite in general supports the idea of cluster transfer .    the second motivation for studying again the @xmath1he+@xmath2be reaction was the attempt to find evidence for the cluster structure of these nuclear systems by the analysis of the reaction products .",
    "the @xmath1he+@xmath2be experiments were performed at the k130 cyclotron facility of the accelerator laboratory of the physics department of jyvskyl university and at the nuclear physics institute ( npi ) , e , czech republic .",
    "the @xmath1he beam energy was 30 mev .",
    "the average beam current during the experiments was maintained at 10 na .",
    "the self - supporting be target was prepared from a 99% pure thin foil of beryllium .",
    "the target thickness was 12 @xmath30 m .",
    "peaks due to carbon and oxygen contaminations were not observed in the energy spectra .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ figure ]    in the third step ,",
    "the cross sections for the transfer reactions @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath8be)@xmath5he and @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath5he)@xmath8be were fitted simultaneously and the om potential parameters for the exit channel @xmath5he+@xmath8be were obtained ( table 1 ) . in the fitting process , the om potential parameters for the entrance channel @xmath2be+@xmath1he obtained in the first step were used . later in the calculations of the total cross section both transition amplitudes corresponding to the alpha - transfer mechanism ( the @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath8be)@xmath5he channel ) and the 2@xmath11-transfer mechanism ( the @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath5he)@xmath8be channel )",
    "have been taken into account .",
    "all calculations and fitting have been performed using the fresco code  @xcite in the framework of the cc method .    by fitting the experimental angular distributions , the attempt was made to determine which reaction mechanisms are the most important for the measured distributions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "5 for the following channels : a ) @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath3he + @xmath10be@xmath9 , b ) @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath5he + @xmath8be and c ) @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath7li + @xmath7li@xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that in the case of @xmath1he+@xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath8be+@xmath5he reaction channel the @xmath12-transfer ( long - dashed curve ) dominates at forward angles , whereas the transfer of the two neutrons ( short - dashed curve ) dominates at backward angles .",
    "the fit for @xmath1he+@xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath7li+@xmath7li ( solid curve ) was obtained assuming @xmath32 transfer from the target nucleus to the projectile . a good agreement between the experimental data and the calculations is observed .",
    "a similar situation may be expected for the case of @xmath1he+@xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath5li+@xmath8li where @xmath33 transfer dominates .    as could be seen from fig .",
    "5 , the main processes describing the angular distributions of the exit channels @xmath3he+@xmath10be@xmath9 , @xmath5he+@xmath8be and @xmath7li+@xmath7li@xmath9 are , respectively , the neutron , @xmath12 and @xmath32 transfer from the target nucleus to the projectile .      due to the borromean structure of @xmath2be the breakup of this nucleus may , in principle , proceed directly into two @xmath12 particles plus a neutron or via one of the unstable intermediate nuclei : @xmath10be or @xmath5he .",
    "the attempt was made to get some insights into @xmath11+@xmath10be , @xmath3he+@xmath5he , @xmath33+@xmath8li and @xmath32+@xmath7li cluster configurations inside of @xmath2be and especially to estimate the relative strengths of the most interesting @xmath10be+@xmath11 and @xmath5he+@xmath12 cluster configurations in @xmath2be .",
    "most likely the studied reaction channels result from the cluster transfer :    @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath1he + ( @xmath11 + @xmath10be ) @xmath31 ( @xmath1he + @xmath11)+ @xmath10be @xmath31 @xmath3he + @xmath10be    @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath1he + ( @xmath12 + @xmath5he ) @xmath31 ( @xmath1he + @xmath12 ) + @xmath5he @xmath31 @xmath8be + @xmath5he    @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath1he + ( @xmath32 + @xmath7li ) @xmath31 ( @xmath1he + @xmath32 ) + @xmath7li @xmath31 @xmath7li + @xmath7li    @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath1he + ( @xmath33 + @xmath8li ) @xmath31 ( @xmath1he + @xmath33 ) + @xmath8li @xmath31 @xmath5li + @xmath8li    @xmath1he + @xmath2be @xmath31 @xmath1he + ( @xmath1he + @xmath7he ) @xmath31 ( @xmath1he + @xmath1he ) + @xmath7he @xmath31 @xmath7be + @xmath7he    these reaction channels are of specific interest since they provide direct information on the cluster structure of the initial and final states .    based on the angular distributions shown in fig .",
    "3 , one may estimate the probability of cluster configurations in @xmath2be . to obtain the branching ratios ( brs ) for the observed channels , the angular distributions were integrated over the solid angle .",

    "@xcite where measurements showed that the @xmath5he+@xmath12 channel was not important for the low - lying excited states of @xmath2be , the discrepancy may be explained from the experimental point of view .",

    "the latter always requires fully defined kinematics allowing the complete reconstruction and identification of events .",
    "the values of the br given in ref .",
    "@xcite were corrected by the geometrical detector efficiency obtained using a special simulating code .",
    "additionally , it should be noted that the values of the branching ratios given in ref .",
    "@xcite are assigned especially to the excited states , whereas our values of the branching ratios are associated entirely with the overall nuclear system @xmath2be .",
    "this clearly calls for theoretical calculations of the @xmath10be+@xmath11 and @xmath12+@xmath3he reaction rate , which at the moment represents a great theoretical challenge .",
    "the direct triton pick - up process requires that @xmath2be has the ( @xmath7li+@xmath32 ) cluster configuration , which seems highly unlikely compared to the ( @xmath12+@xmath12+@xmath11 ) configuration .",
    "also , the interpretation of any ( @xmath1he,@xmath7li ) reaction in terms of triton pick - up requires that @xmath7li has the ( @xmath1he + @xmath32 ) cluster configuration , which seems equally unlikely compared to the ( @xmath12 + @xmath33 ) configuration .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for @xmath7li the ( @xmath1he+@xmath32 ) configuration is only slightly less probable than the ( @xmath12+@xmath33 ) configuration .",
    "since such cluster configurations are not mutually exclusive , one can not judge upon the relative importance of the ( @xmath7li+@xmath32 ) cluster configuration of @xmath2be without making careful cluster structure calculations .",
    "indeed , the differential cross section for the @xmath8li in the outgoing channel is higher than for the channel leading to @xmath7li .",
    "another objective in measuring the ( @xmath1he,@xmath7li ) channel was to evaluate the strength of the triton clustering .",
    "the present measurements imply that @xmath2be contains a significant fraction of the ( @xmath7li+@xmath32 ) cluster configuration .",

    "similarly , the @xmath1he+@xmath1he cluster structure could be assigned to @xmath7be , @xmath32+@xmath1he to @xmath7li , @xmath1he+@xmath3he to @xmath8be as well as @xmath5he+@xmath3he and @xmath1he+@xmath7he to @xmath2be .    as estimated above",
    ", the time for the energy equilibration is rather short .",
    "therefore , it could be assumed that the sequential multi - step reactions can not not take place and all transfers must happen rather suddenly .",

    "the performed analysis of the experimental data shows that the potential parameters are quite sensitive to the exit channel and hence to the cluster structure of the populated states , which allows to make general observations and conclusions regarding the internal structure of the target and residual nuclei .    in the first step",

    "the fitting result does not reflect any possible peculiarities in the om parameters in the case of the unbound @xmath5he nucleus .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath11 , @xmath33 , @xmath32 , and @xmath1he transfer channels were measured in the @xmath1he+@xmath2be collision at the incident energy 30 mev .",
    "the proposed om potential provides a good fit of the elastic scattering in the entrance channels .",
    "the dwba calculations agree well with the transfer reaction data .",
    "the spectroscopic factors needed to fit the transfer channels are close to unity , which confirms the significant contribution of the considered cluster configurations to the structure of the ground states .",
    "we also show the possibility to extract the structural information from the comparative analysis of the @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath7li)@xmath7li and @xmath2be(@xmath1he,@xmath7be)@xmath7he reaction channels .    the experiment was designed to study the breakup of @xmath2be in an attempt to determine the contribution of the @xmath10be+@xmath11 and @xmath5he+@xmath12 channels in the inclusive measurements .",
    "the ratio 2.7:1 may be assigned for the contributions of these two channels , respectively .",
