    "the interaction of electromagnetic fields with matter is one of the most fundamental problems in physics .",
    "the conventional way to introduce the interaction with the photon into the matter equation of motion is by perturbation theory . for this attitude to be adequate",
    ", the interaction term should be small with respect to the other terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , if the amplitude of the electromagnetic field under consideration exceeds a certain value , a different framework must be adopted . in order to quantitatively",
    "characterize the transition to the strong field regime ( where the standard perturbation theory fails ) , the non - linearity parameter is introduced @xmath0 natural units are used ( @xmath1 ) , e and m are the electron charge and mass respectively and @xmath2 is the amplitude of the vector potential @xmath3 .",
    "the intuitive interpretation of @xmath4 , which is the reciprocal of the known keldysh parameter @xcite , is the typical number of photons participating in the scattering process of the particle and the elecromagnetic wave ( from now on the initials em shall be used ) . as a result ,",
    "if @xmath5 , i.e. in the strong - field regime , it involves many photons absorption . in the opposite case ( @xmath6 ) , known as the perturbative regime , a non - linear process is possible but the rate @xmath7 decreases sharply with @xmath8 ( the number of the participating photons ) , namely @xmath9 . in practical units",
    "the non - linearity parameter is given by @xmath10}/\\omega[ev]$ ] , where @xmath11 are the laser intensity and frequency respectively .",
    "the failure of the standard perturbation technique in the strong field regime calls for a nonperturbative formalism .",
    "the essence of the nonperturbative attitude ( also known as the strong field approximation ) is that instead of treating the laser background perturbatively , we include it in the free lagrangian @xcite .",
    "therefore , nonperturbative calculations of qed processes in the presence of a laser field ( `` laser assisted '' ) are carried out by replacing the free electron wavefunction appearing in the quantum calculation with the solution of a particle interacting with an em plane wave traveling in vacuum ( known as the volkov wavefunction @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental exploration of the strong field regime became feasible due to the invention of the chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) technique 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "since then , the laser intensity has increased in 8 orders of magnitude to the up - to - date record @xcite of @xmath12 at infra - red wavelength ( @xmath13 ) , corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "several laser infrastructures with an expected intensity of @xmath15 are under construction worldwide , among which the 3 facilities of the eli project @xcite .",
    "several others are in the planning phase , such as the xcels @xcite in russia , hiper @xcite in the uk and gekko exa @xcite in japan",
    ".    concurrently , a breakthrough in free electron laser physics during the 80 s made it possible to achieve intense coherent x ray light .",
    "nowadays there are several operating xfel facilities ( e.g. lcls in standford @xcite , sacla in japan @xcite and flash in hamburg @xcite ) and one under construction ( xfel in hamburg @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum intensity produced in these facilities lies in the range @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "the experimental availability of such intense field sources creates exciting opportunities in many research fields related to strong field physics @xcite , such as attosecond spectroscopy @xcite , relativistic nonlinear optics and relativistic high - order harmonic generation @xcite , ultrastrong laser - plasma interaction and particle acceleration @xcite , laboratory astrophysics @xcite , laser - assisted qed processes @xcite , schwinger pair production @xcite and exotic nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this work is devoted to one of the most significant laser - assisted qed processes - the non - linear compton scattering . unlike the standard compton process",
    ", where a photon scatters off an electron , the non - linear compton describes the coherent interaction of many photons with an electron .",
    "the outcoming particles are the electron and a single energetic photon .",
    "this scattering is of particular significance for several reasons .",
    "first , it may be used to create gamma sources in the interaction of ultra - intense lasers with an energetic electrons beam .",
    "second , it is one of the main processes responsible to the electron radiation losses in the interaction of ultra - intense lasers with plasma . in particular ,",
    "the interplay between this process and the breit - wheeler process , involving a hard photon interacting with many laser photons to create an electron - positron pair , may result in a mechanism called `` qed cascade '' in the following way .",
    "the hard photon emitted during the non - linear compton decays into an electron - positron pair through the breit - wheeler scattering .",
    "the newly born particles also radiate hard photons through the non - linear compton , leading to the emergence of an avalanche .",
    "these qed cascades attract increasing scientific attention @xcite both for fundamental and practical causes .",
    "practically , spontaneous cascades may drain energy from the laser pulse and thus limit the utmost attainable intensity @xcite . from fundamental point of view",
    "the cascades are of interest as they result in a qed plasma ( namely electrons , positrons and gamma photons ) resembling many astrophysical scenarios @xcite .",
    "the most favorable configuration to achieve the qed cascade is a rotating electric field @xcite .",
    "it may realized in the vicinity of the antinodes of a standing wave formed by two counterpropagating laser beams .",
    "the standard kinetic modeling is consisted of a pic code to describe the plasma motion combined with a monte carlo qed module to account for the strong field qed emission processes listed above .",
    "the qed rates are those obtained by the volkov wavefunction , though the em field configuration is different than the one used in the volkov derivation .",
    "the justification to this approximation was formulated in the first treatment of the non - linear compton , carried out by ritus , nikishov and narozhny @xcite in the 60 s ( see also the comprehensive review @xcite ) . their derivation is established on the volkov solution and will be referred from now on as `` volkov - ritus '' .",
    "the explanation of their argument requires the introduction of the 4 dimensionless quantities on which the quantum rate depends .",
    "the first is the field strength @xmath4 introduced above .",
    "the second is the normalized acceleration experienced by the particle in its rest frame .",
    "it is known as the quantum parameter and takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the eigenvalue of the kinetic momentum operator @xmath20 and the em field strength tensor is given by @xmath21 the classical regime , i.e. the non - linear thomson scattering , corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "the next generation lasers are expected to enter the quantum regime , @xmath23 .",
    "two additional quantities are the em field invariants @xmath24 the symbol @xmath25 stands for the levi - civita tensor .",
    "ritus and nikishov argued that as long as the following conditions hold @xmath26 the rate is well described by the volkov - ritus expression ( coinciding under these conditions with the emission in a constant crossed field ) .",
    "however , it was recently demonstrated by the authors @xcite that the wavefunction of a particle in a rotating electric field exhibits significant deviation from the volkov solution even if ( [ eq : av assump ] ) is satisfied .",
    "consequently , we are motivated to explore the emission rate corresponding to our new wavefunction as compared to the familiar volkov - ritus rate . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the investigation was carried out for the scalar case , neglecting the spin effects .",
    "these were shown to be of secondary importance for ultra - intense laser particle interaction @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "a lagrangian formulation of the problem , including second quantization , is required .",
