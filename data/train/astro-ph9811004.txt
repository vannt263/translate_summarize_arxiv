    "one of the most fundamental problems in cosmology is to understand the formation and evolution of the large - scale structure in the universe such as galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies , etc . in order to understand the large - scale structure ,",
    "however , it is highly desirable to have an analytical framework within which theoretical predictions for structure formation can be made . the cosmological mass function",
    ", @xmath8 [ @xmath9 : defined as the comoving number density of gravitationally bound structures  dark halos with mass @xmath10 provides this analytical tool since different candidate models for structure formation predict different number densities of dark halos .    press & schechter ( 1974 , hereafter ps ) developed for the first time an analytic formalism to evaluate the mass function .",
    "finding a mass function requires both dynamics and statistics .",
    "dynamically ps adopted the top - hat spherical model , according to which the collapse condition for forming dark halos is determined purely by its local average density .",
    "statistically ps assumed that the initial density field is gaussian , and selected dark halos from the peaks of the linear gaussian density field .    the practical success of the ps mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and the absence of viable alternatives led many authors to use it routinely in the last decade(e.g .",
    ", @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "but , recently high resolution n - body simulations have shown the limitation of the ps theory : first , it has been clearly shown by several n - body simulations that the true gravitational collapse process must be nonspherical ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , indicating the weakness of the ps dynamical background .",
    "second , n - body simulations also showed that peaks of the linear density field are `` poorly '' correlated with the final spatial locations of dark halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although the ps formalism assumes that dark halos form in the peaks of the density field .",
    "third , recent high - resolution numerical tests have detected that experimental results are flatter than the standard ps mass function in shape ( e.g. , governato et al .",
    "1998 ; tormen 1998 and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "currently various attempts have been made to find a better - fitting mass function .",
    "one approach to better mass functions has been focused on finding phenomenological fitting parameters , keeping the original ps formula unchanged ; for example , regarding the density threshold as a function of redshift , etc ( see governato et al . 1998 ; @xcite ) .",
    "another approach has been on improving the dynamics of the ps formalism by implementing anisotropic collapse conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ; audit , teyssier , & alimi 1997 ) .",
    "a full analytical alternative of the ps mass function using this approach has been found by @xcite , in the frame of the zeldovich approximation .",
    "this approach goes along with the assumption that dark halos correspond to the third axis collapse .",
    "indeed the mass function we found in the previous paper is both a dynamically and statistically improved version of the ps one .",
    "first , it is based on a more realistic _ nonspherical _ dynamical model .",
    "second , the underlying statistical assumption that dark halos form in the local maxima of the smallest eigenvalue of the deformation tensor , @xmath11 ( see @xmath12 ) is in general agreement with the n - body results performed by @xcite .",
    "third , and most importantly our mass function was shown to have desired properties like a lower peak and more high - mass halos .",
    "that is , our mass function is flatter than the ps one .    in this letter we present numerical testing results of our mass function for the case of two fiducial models : the scale - free power - law spectra with spectral indices @xmath1 , and the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in @xmath12",
    "we briefly summarize the analytic mass function theories for the readers convenience .",
    "in @xmath13 we explain the n - body simulations used to produce the numerical mass functions , and compare the analytical mass functions with the numerical results . in @xmath14",
    "we draw a final conclusion .",
    "the ps theory assumes that dark halos of mass @xmath15 form hierarchically in the regions where the linear gaussian density field @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : mean density ) filtered on mass scale @xmath15 reaches its threshold value @xmath18 for collapse : @xmath19}.\\ ] ]    the density threshold @xmath18 for a flat universe is originally given by the spherical top - hat model : @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but in many numerical tests it has been detected that lowered @xmath18 ( roughly @xmath21 ) gives a better fit in the high - mass section ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that any ps - like formalism is least reliable in the low - mass section ( @xcite ) .",
    "this numerical detection can be understood in the following dynamical argument : although the top - hat spherical model predicts that the gravitational collapse to `` infinite '' density occurs when the density reaches @xmath22 , halos in realistic case can form earlier by a rapid virialization process due to the growth of small - scale inhomogeneities ( @xcite ) .    on the other hand , according to our approach ( lee & shandarin 1998 ) , dark halos of mass @xmath15 form from the lagrangian regions where the lowest eigenvalue @xmath11 ( @xmath23 ) of the deformation tensor @xmath24 ( defined as the second derivative of the perturbation potential @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the lagrangian coordinate ) reaches its threshold @xmath28 for collapse on the scale @xmath15 : @xmath29    in the original derivation of our mass function , the threshold @xmath28 for collapse has been empirically chosen to be @xmath30 .",
    "a similar logic used to give a dynamical explanation to the lowered @xmath18 of the ps formalism applies here .",
    "although a simple extrapolation of the zeldovich approximation to nonlinear regime predicts that the formation of dark halos corresponding to the third axis collapse occurs at @xmath31 , the first and the second axis collapse speed up the formation of halos , which would result in a lowered @xmath28 ( see also @xcite ) .    in @xmath32 3 , we witness that our mass function with the original suggested value of @xmath33 does agree with the numerical data quite well .",
    "the n - body simulations of a flat matter - dominated universe for power - law spectra @xmath34 with spectral indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 were run by @xcite using a particle - particle - particle - mesh code with @xmath37 particles in a @xmath38 grid with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "tormen ( 1998 , 1999 ) identified dark halos from the n - body simulations using a standard halo finder  the friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length @xmath39 [ hereafter fof ( 0.2 ) ] .",
    "numerical data for the @xmath35 power - law model were obtained for 10 different output times coming from two n - body realizations , and then a final @xmath4 numerical mass function was obtained by taking an average over the 10 output values . while for the @xmath40 model 4 outputs from one n - body realization were averaged to produce a final numerical mass function . for a detailed description of the simulations ,",
    "see @xcite . here",
    "we use the final average numerical mass functions for comparison data .    for the power - law spectra ,",
    "the mass variance is given by the following simple form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the characteristic mass scale .",
    "but here we use @xmath43 to notate a slightly different mass scale .",
    "readers should not be confused about this different notation of the characteristic mass . ]",
    "defined by @xmath44 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to define a filter - depending nonlinear mass scale @xmath43 related to @xmath42 by @xmath45 for a dimensionless rescaled mass variable @xmath46 such that @xmath47 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 plots the fraction of mass in halos with mass @xmath15 , @xmath48 : our mass function with @xmath49 ( solid line ) against the averaged numerical data with poissonian error bars , and the ps mass function with @xmath50 and @xmath21 ( dashed and dotted lines respectively ) as well .",
    "the upper panel corresponds to the @xmath4 power - law model while the lower panel to the @xmath5 model .",
    "as one can see , our mass function fits the numerical data much better than the ps ones for the @xmath4 model in the high - mass section ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "in fact @xcite also used the spherical overdensity algorithm [ so ( 178 ) ] as another halo finder , and showed that the numerical mass functions from fof ( 0.2 ) and so ( 178 ) are almost identical .",
    "we compared the analytical mass functions with his numerical data obtained from so ( 178 ) and also found similar results . whereas for the @xmath5 model , neither of our mass function and the ps one fits the numerical data well in the high - mass section . yet in the low - mass section @xmath52 our mass function fits slightly better than the ps one for this case .",
    "@xcite provided halo catalogs produced from one large n - body realization ( comoving box size of @xmath53 , @xmath54 million particles on a @xmath55 grid ) of scdm model with @xmath56 for four different epochs : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath7 which are respectively normalized by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "they adopted the transfer function given by @xcite and also used the fof ( 0.2 ) halo finder . for a detailed description of the simulations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we derived the numerical mass functions from the catalogs by directly counting the number densities of halos in logarithmic scale for each epoch . in accordance with @xcite",
    ", we consider halos more than @xmath64 particles ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) in order to avoid small - number effects of the n - body simulations .",
    "figure 2 shows the comparison results .",
    "our mass function with @xmath49 ( solid line ) fits the numerical data much better than the ps ones with @xmath50 and @xmath21 ( dashed and dotted lines respectively ) for all chosen epochs .",
    "we have numerically tested an analytical mass function recently derived by @xcite , and compared the results with that of the standard press - schechter one .",
    "our mass function is not just a phenomenologically obtained fitting formula but a new analytic formula derived through modification of the ps theory using a nonspherical dynamical model .",
    "it is based on the zeldovich approximation taking into account the nonspherical nature of real gravitational collapse process , while the ps mass function is based on the top - hat spherical model .",
    "consequently our mass function is characterized by the threshold value of the smallest eigenvalue of the deformation tensor , @xmath28 while the ps one by the density threshold , @xmath18 .",
    "we have shown that in the power - law model with spectral index @xmath4 and the four different epochs of scdm our mass function with @xmath49 is significantly better than the ps one with @xmath66 .",
    "it fits the numerical data well especially in the high - mass section ( corresponding to groups and clusters of galaxies ) for these two models .",
    "furthermore it is worth noting that in the testing results for scdm model our mass function agrees with the data well with a consistent threshold value of @xmath30 at all chosen redshifts .    on the contrary",
    ", the testing result for the @xmath5 power - law model has shown that there are considerable discrepancies between the analytical mass functions ( both of our mass function and the ps one ) and the numerical data in the high - mass section .",
    "the discrepancies with theory for the @xmath5 model , however , have been already detected ( @xcite ) . yet in the low - mass section our mass function fits the data slightly better for this case .",
    "although we have tested our mass function only for two different models , given the promising testing results of our mass function demonstrated here , we conclude that it will provide a more accurate analytical tool to study structure formation .",
    "further testings of the new mass function are obviously very desirable and will be reported in the following publications .",
    "we are very grateful to giuseppe tormen who provided the @xmath67 numerical mass functions , and also for serving as a referee in helping to improve the original manuscript .",
