    "in this paper , we discuss the high energy limit of hadron nucleus scattering and their influence on air shower properties , as described in ref .",
    "when approaching highest energies , we expect the differential scattering amplitude to become close to unity .",
    "the partons acquire a large transverse momentum of the order of the saturation scale , which leads to an steeper spectrum of forward scattered particles , the most important phase space region for air shower properties .",
    "all air showers in this paper have been computed with the seneca model @xcite using urqmd  1.3.1 @xcite as low - energy model below 100 gev .",

    "our approach is to consider the black disk limit ( or black body limit - bbl ) at high gluon densities within the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach@xcite , where the interaction probability is close to unity . within this model ,",
    "the scattering amplitude of a quark on a dense gluon field is resummed to all orders .",
    "this can be done since the typical scale of the gluon density , the so - called saturation momentum @xmath2 is larger than @xmath3 and weak coupling methods are applicable .    the monte carlo interaction model , which incorporates the physics discussed here has been introduced in ref.@xcite and discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "the most important feature is the suppression of forward scattering . as a consequence of energy conservation we also find an increase of particle production at lower rapidities .",
    "although less important for the longitudinal profile of an air shower , this results in an increased muon production and is therefore important to be considered when deducing composition from this observable .",
    "since this approach is only valid when the saturation momentum is large , we use this model only in the high energy / high density limit . for low energies and peripheral interactions we use the standard pqcd monte carlo model sibyll @xcite .",

    "right panel : inelasticity @xmath4 , evaluated in the forward phase space region @xmath5.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    results for the mean @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "the longitudinal profile is dominated by mainly two observables , the forward scattering , often described by the inelasticity ( @xmath6 of the fastest particle ) and the inelastic cross section which determines the mean free path . since we have used the inelastic cross sections from sibyll , differences to this model",
    "are due to the reduced forward scattering solely , whereas the difference to qgsjet01 @xcite comes from a combination of both different cross sections and inelasticity .",
    "also shown are the results for iron induced showers computed with the bbl model by simple superposition of nucleon - air collisions , just as in sibyll .",
    "this should give a good estimate , since the the running coupling evolution is less sensitive to initial conditions , i.e. the density of the projectile .",
    "the full implementation of nucleus - nucleus collisions with consideration of projectile saturation scale will be left for the future .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the inelasticity of the models , defined as mean @xmath7 of the fastest particle .",
    "the right panel shows @xmath8 , which corresponds to the inelasticity averaged over a larger region in forward phase space , not only the fastest particle .    the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows @xmath0 for sibyll and bbl when one applies inelastic cross - sections from qgsjet01 which are somewhat smaller , see e.g. @xcite . at largest energies",
    "the @xmath0 of sibyll and bbl get shifted by ca .",
    "15  g/@xmath9 and reach 50 and 30  g/@xmath9 larger depth than qgsjet , correspondingly . assuming the same inelastic cross - sections , bbl has a larger @xmath0 than qgsjet01 , despite a larger inelasticity of the former . but as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , qgsjet01 has a larger @xmath4 , as a consequence of a rather flat @xmath10-distribution at these energies . clearly , the inelasticity alone is not sufficient to characterize forward scattering . in ref",
    "@xcite is was shown that @xmath0 is sensitve to the forward region down to @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the @xmath4 , or even @xmath12 variable is more suitable to describe this specific range .",
    "left : rapidity of charged particles for p+air at @xmath13 ev . right : electron / positron and muon numbers in the intermediate energy range.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   left : rapidity of charged particles for p+air at @xmath13 ev .",
    "right : electron / positron and muon numbers in the intermediate energy range.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the major consequence of the implementation of the black body limit is the suppression of forward scattering .",
    "however , this also leads to an enhancement of the multiplicity in the mid - rapidity region , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nmne ] .",
    "this has almost no influence on the longitudinal profile , but increases the muon numbers as decay products of low - energy particles .",
    "a plot of mean electron / positron and muon numbers is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nmne ] . the bbl model seems to interpolate somewhat between the results of sibyll and qgsjet01 , with the transition happening at about @xmath14  ev .",
    "since the primary energy is shared between the nucleons of the projectile nucleus , this interpolation also happens as a function of mass number @xmath15 at correspondingly higher energy .",
    "this can be seen for the carbon projectile in the knee region . whether this model can help to resolve known problems of models in kascade ,",
    "is subject to a detailed comparison .",

    "ratios to the ldfs of sibyll are plotted .",
    "besides from a small decrease of the slope for electrons and photons , most noticeable is the increased muon number .",
    "qgsjet01 shows the same qualitative behavior as bbl . since muons dominate the vem signal at large distances , the combined ldf in vem units shows a significantly flatter slope .",
