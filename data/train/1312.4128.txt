    "however , from eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) , we find that the integral @xmath109 contains the factor @xmath7 , which means that the deflection angle @xmath114 for the photon traveling in the same direction as the rotation of the black hole is different from that traveling in converse direction .",
    "this tells us that although the black hole has the rotation paraters both in the @xmath68 and @xmath4 directions , in the equatorial plane @xmath61 the rotation of the black hole is really in the @xmath68 direction rather than in the @xmath4 direction , which is also shown in the induce metric ( [ l1 ] ) where the only cross - term is @xmath115 .",
