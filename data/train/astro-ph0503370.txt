    "kinematically - distinct cores ( kdcs ) occur in @xmath8 of elliptical galaxies ; a few tens of such systems are currently known @xcite .",
    "the kinematically - distinct regions have sizes ranging in radius from 0.06 to 2kpc and have been observed in galaxies which reside in environments ranging from loose groups to dense galaxy clusters .",
    "counter - rotating cores are a subset of kdcs and provide the strongest evidence that these regions are formed during merging events .",
    "@xcite investigated the formation of counter - rotating cores via the dissipationless merging of unequal mass elliptical galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "the dense core of the smaller galaxy survives the merger and sinks to the center of the primary galaxy via dynamical friction . for certain merging geometries , the surviving core will be kinematically misaligned and will occasionally counter - rotate with respect to its host galaxy . merging / interactions are not necessarily required to explain kinematically - distinct cores in all cases .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that projection effects in a dynamically - smooth triaxial system were able to explain a kdc in ngc  5982 which rotates about its minor - axis .",
    "projection effects , however , do not easily explain cores with counter - rotation about the major axis .",
    "the theories described above can not naturally explain the presence of faint stellar disks detected on the same scale as the kdcs in several galaxies .",
    "in these cases , the more likely formation scenario is the merging or interaction of two separate systems with available gas reservoirs . during the interaction ,",
    "a disk is formed via the dissipative infall of gas , which eventually cools to form stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented photometric evidence for underlying disks in roughly half of the 15 elliptical galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores they imaged with _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ wide field planetary camera  2 .",
    "these authors find no significant color difference between the disk and main galaxy body , although evidence of color differences and stellar population gradients has been presented in other systems . @xcite and @xcite find evidence for line - strength gradients in three separate systems in the sense that the kinematically - distinct cores have enhanced @xmath9-element to iron abundance ratios relative to the main galaxy , but similarly old ages .",
    "they interpret these gradients as evidence of rapid star formation during the formation of the kdc , however , similar gradients have been observed in ellipticals galaxies which do not host kdcs @xcite .",
    "in addition to the presence of disks , strong line - strength gradients argue further in favor of dissipational merging since dissipationless processes tend to weaken such gradients .    the majority of known kdcs reside in elliptical galaxies brighter than @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite recently presented evidence for kdcs in two dwarf elliptical galaxies ( @xmath11 ) found in galaxy - rich groups .",
    "the cores of these two dwarf galaxies rotate in the same direction as the main galaxy body , but with a slower rotation speed .",
    "these authors propose an alternative formation mechanism to the merging scenario in which kdcs are formed via flyby interactions between the dwarf and a more massive galaxy .",
    "angular momentum is transfered to the outer envelope of the dwarf during these interactions which results in a kinematic decoupling between the outer envelope and inner core .",
    "such a scenario is favored in dense galaxy environments where the probability of dwarf - dwarf galaxy merging is low due to the large relative velocities between galaxies .",

    "finally , in  [ sec_discuss ] , we discuss possible scenarios for the formation of the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 .    a true distance modulus to ngc  770 of @xmath13 , i.e. ,  a distance of 32.9  mpc , is adopted throughout this paper .",

    "the half - light effective radius , sersic index , and other photometric quantities agree with previous photometry by @xcite and are listed in table  1 .",
    "ngc  770 is classified by @xcite as an `` e3 : '' galaxy , the colon indicating uncertainty in the classification .",
    "the source of this uncertainty is due to the shape of the surface brightness profile of this galaxy , shown in figure  [ fig_sb ] .",
    "the profile is not well fit by either the de  vaucouleurs @xmath66 law , nor an exponential profile .",
    "rather , the best fitting sersic index for ngc  770 is @xmath64 , intermediate between a @xmath67 exponential profile typical for a dwarf elliptical and a @xmath68 de  vaucouleurs law typical of giant ellipticals .",
    "ngc  770 is half a magnitude brighter ( @xmath69 ) than the brightest classified dwarf elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster and three magnitudes brighter than elliptical satellites ngc  205 and m32 in the local group .",
    "it is best classified as a low - luminosity elliptical galaxy .",
    "close inspection of the inner photometric contours in figure  [ fig_sb2d ] ( left panel ) , shows elongated , disky central isophotes and boxy isophotes at larger radii .",
    "this is quantitatively confirmed by the @xmath61 profile in figure  [ fig_sb ] which is positive ( disky ) in the central @xmath28 , and negative ( boxy ) between radii @xmath70 to @xmath71 . to study the substructure implied by the one - dimensional profile , we plot in figure  [ fig_sb2d ] ( middle panel ) the result of subtracting a two - dimensional surface brightness model from the original image .",

    "both the model - subtracted and unsharp - masked images suggest a disk in the central region of ngc  770 whose major axis is slightly misaligned with the major axis of the galaxy at larger radii .",
    "the central disk extends out to a radius of @xmath28@xmath74 ( 0.50.6kpc ) , slightly less than the half - light radius of the galaxy ( @xmath75 ) . while the vertical extent of this disk is unresolved in the images ( @xmath25 seeing fwhm )",
    ", we can put an upper limit on this quantity of @xmath76 .",
    "the major axis of the disky region seen in the model - subtracted and unsharp - masked image is misaligned by @xmath5 with respect to the major axis of the main galaxy body , consistent with the isophotal twist between the inner and outer regions seen in the position angle profile in figure  [ fig_sb ] . to estimate the fraction of light contained in the disky region , we compare the flux in the model - subtracted image to that of the original .",
    "the model was scaled such that no negative flux was present in the inner @xmath71 of the model - subtracted image .",
    "the model - subtracted image contains 6% of the total galaxy light ; isolating the elongated disk region inside a radius of @xmath74 represents 3.5% of the total galaxy light .",
    "we show below that the inner disky region is co - spatial and aligned with the counter - rotating core .",
    "the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 is clearly seen in the major axis keck / esi velocity profile shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig_vpesi ] .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocity profile reveals a kinematically - distinct core rotating in a direction opposite to that of the main galaxy body . in these data ,",
    "the counter - rotating region has an average maximum rotation velocity of @xmath77 km  s@xmath1 , but is asymmetric with respect to the galaxy center .",
    "we show in  [ subsec_2d ] that this asymmetry is due to a @xmath78 misalignment of the esi slit with respect to the major - axis of counter - rotation .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity of the main galaxy body is larger than that of the counter - rotating region",
    ". we do not reach large enough radius to observe a conclusive turnover in the main galaxy rotation curve and measure a lower limit to the main body rotation of @xmath79 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile in figure  [ fig_vpesi ] is symmetric with respect to the galaxy center , peaking at @xmath80 km  s@xmath1at @xmath81 and declining gently in the central regions to a central value of 76 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this central drop in the velocity dispersion profile is observed in other counter - rotating core galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is usually interpreted as the central region being disk - like and kinematically colder than the outer regions .",
    "however , this is not the only interpretation as galaxies without counter - rotating cores often show similar drops in the central velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "if the main body of ngc  770 were supported by rotational motion then the expected ratio of the maximum rotation velocity to central velocity dispersion would be @xmath82 given a measured ellipticity of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the observed ratio is @xmath84 , but is a lower limit due to our limited radial coverage .",
    "it is likely that the main galaxy body of ngc  770 is rotationally supported , consistent with what is seen in elliptical galaxies of similar luminosity @xcite .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure  [ fig_vpesi ] show the radial profiles of the gauss - hermite moments @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these parameters measure the deviations of the line - of - sight velocity profile from a gaussian profile .",
    "the @xmath35 parameter measures asymmetric deviations , while @xmath36 measures symmetric deviations .",
    "the @xmath35 profile in figure  [ fig_vpesi ] has the same shape as the velocity profile , but with opposite sign .",
    "the @xmath36 parameter peaks at negative values ( a flatter than gaussian velocity profile ) where the counter - rotating velocity returns to zero .",
    "a plausible interpretation of the @xmath35 profile is the presence of two kinematically - distinct components : in the counter - rotating region , the lower velocity stars of the main galaxy produce an asymmetric tail in the velocity profile in a direction opposite that of rotation .",
    "however , this sign difference between the @xmath35 and velocity profiles is also seen in galaxies without counter - rotating cores ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "thus , although the higher - order moments suggest the presence of two kinematic components in the inner region of ngc  770 , it is hard to provide an unambiguous interpretation of these data .",
    "the two - dimensional gemini / gmos ifu velocity ( figure  [ fig_gmos_vel ] ) and velocity dispersion ( figure  [ fig_gmos_sig ] ) maps confirm the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 and provide evidence that stars in this region are moving in a disk .",
    "the velocity of the counter - rotating core is symmetric with respect to the photometric center of the galaxy , peaking at a maximum velocity of @xmath85 km  s@xmath1  at a spatial position of ( @xmath53 ,  @xmath54 )  =  ( @xmath86 ,  @xmath87 ) and ( @xmath88 ,  @xmath89 ) in figure  [ fig_gmos_vel ] .",
    "in the top panel of this figure , we show a one - dimensional velocity profile determined by averaging over a @xmath90 wide slit placed along the major axis of counter - rotation . unlike the single - slit keck / esi data shown in figure  [ fig_vpesi ] , the velocity profile is symmetric , peaking at a radial distance of @xmath91 .",
    "the velocity dispersion map in figure  [ fig_gmos_sig ] shows a colder , lower velocity dispersion central region which is slightly elongated along the axis of counter - rotation .",
    "we estimate the size of the counter - rotating region by fitting an ellipse to a zero - velocity contour in figure  [ fig_gmos_vel ] excluding the central half arcsecond .",
    "the best fitting ellipse has a semi - major axis of @xmath92 and semi - minor axis of @xmath4 .",
    "the seeing during these observations was @xmath50 fwhm .",
    "thus , we are able to put an upper limit on the scale height of the counter - rotating disk of @xmath4 = 130pc due to both seeing limitations and the unknown inclination angle .",
    "this is consistent with the photometric estimates of the disk size presented in  [ sec_disk ] .",
    "the position angle of the best - fitting zero - velocity ellipse in figure  [ fig_gmos_vel ] is @xmath5 relative to the major - axis of the main galaxy or @xmath93 east of north .",
    "this misalignment between the main galaxy body and the counter - rotating core is consistent with the isophotal twist measured between the inner and outer galaxy in ",
    "[ sec_disk ] .",
    "this misalignment is sufficient to explain the asymmetry observed in the single - slit esi velocity profile which was placed along the photometric major axis of the main galaxy body .",
    "we compute line - strength indices according to the lick / ids system @xcite in the wavelength region @xmath94 .",
    "lick indices are calculated only for the one - dimensional esi spectra since the two - dimensional gmos ifu data are confined to a narrow spectral region . a more detailed description of the procedures to measure line - strength indices for esi data is provided in @xcite .",
    "briefly , line - strength indices were computed by shifting the esi spectra to rest frame wavelengths and convolving with a wavelength - dependent gaussian kernel to match the spectral resolution of the lick / ids system .",
    "the size of the kernel ranged between @xmath95 ( 4045 esi spectral pixels , gaussian sigma ) .",
    "line - strengths were then calculated according to the index definitions of @xcite .",
    "error bars on the indices were computed via monte - carlo simulations which include contributions from photon noise , read - out noise and pixel - to - pixel correlations due to gaussian smoothing .",
    "we compare the weighted average line - strengths for the inner ( @xmath96 ) and outer ( @xmath97 ) counter - rotating core plotted as solid and open points , respectively , in figure  [ fig_index ] .",
    "we do not measure line - strengths beyond the counter - rotating region ( @xmath98 ) due to insufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "however , because the esi slit was slightly misaligned with respect to the counter - rotating disk , the outer measurement will contain more light from the main galaxy as compared to the inner measurement . to determine the luminosity - weighted stellar ages and metallicities , we plot the mgb and @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 ( fe5270 + fe5335)/2 ) indices against h@xmath101 in figure  [ fig_index ] .",

    "although the absolute ages and metallicities are subject to systematic errors in the models , the _ relative _ ages between the two components are more secure .",
    "the difference between the line - strengths measured in the inner and outer core may be due to a stellar population gradient within the counter - rotating region or represent contamination from the main galaxy in the outer measurement .",
    "we favor the latter interpretation since the age and metallicity for the outer core agree with the global line - strength measurements presented by @xcite of ngc  770 .",
    "the outer core is consistent with the average age and metallicity measured for a sample of dwarf elliptical galaxies of comparable and fainter luminosities presented by @xcite .",
    "the age of the inner counter - rotating region is younger than for typical dwarf elliptical galaxies .",

    "this deficiency can be interpreted as either a hole in the hi distribution , or the inner region of an hi arm which has wrapped around the primary galaxy .",
    "the asymmetry of the hi distribution requires a recent interaction , we discuss possible scenarios below .",
    "the discovery of a counter - rotating core in ngc  770 is unusual as this host is not the primary galaxy in this system and it lies in a region of on - going tidal interactions .",
    "ongoing star formation in the asymmetric arm of the primary galaxy ngc  772 , and the short dynamical lifetime of such a structure requires a triggering interaction in the past few 100myrs @xcite .",
    "the ngc  772/770 system is isolated  the lack of any other massive objects in this system strongly suggests that this most recent interaction involved ngc  772 and ngc  770 .",
    "the presence of a faint optical trail of material close to satellite galaxy ngc  770 ( figure  [ fig_dss ] ) and its position relative to the hi gas distribution ( figure  [ fig_hi ] ) support this hypothesis .",
    "the mass ratio between these two galaxies is 20:1 , assuming they have similar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "careful modeling is required to understand the details of this interaction .",
    "although it is likely that ngc  772 and ngc  770 are undergoing ( or have recently undergone ) tidal interaction , the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 could not have been formed during these most recent interactions .",
    "the inferred age of the counter - rotating core in the satellite galaxy ngc  770 is 3gyr , longer than a reasonable estimate for the orbital period of ngc  770 .",
    "the radial velocity difference between between ngc  772 and ngc  770 is 70 km  s@xmath1 . assuming a transverse velocity comparable to the measured radial velocity , the space velocity of ngc  770 is @xmath112 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "if the projected distance of ngc  770 is the radius of its orbit around ngc  772 , then its orbital period is 1.5gyr .",
    "if ngc  770 is currently on an unbound orbit , it would have been roughly 500kpc from ngc  772 at the time of the counter - rotating core s formation .",
    "thus , the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 was formed somewhere between the outskirts of this group or closer to the primary galaxy ngc  772 , two to three orbits ago .",
    "the lack of other large galaxies in this region limit the possible formation scenarios for the formation of the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 .",
    "we discuss several possibilities : ( 1 ) ngc  770 accreted a small dwarf galaxy during a very minor merging event , ( 2 ) ngc  770 accreted material from the primary galaxy during earlier orbital interactions , or ( 3 ) the counter - rotating region was formed via angular momentum transfer to the outer envelope of the galaxy via harassment .",
    "the age difference between the core and the main body of ngc  770 (  [ sec_lick ] ) suggest that the counter - rotating region was not formed concurrently with the main galaxy .",
    "the absolute age of the counter - rotating region of 3gyr suggests that it was not formed during the interactions which caused the disturbances seen in the primary spiral galaxy ngc  772 since these features have dynamical lifetimes of 100myr .",
    "observational evidence presented in  [ sec_disk ] and  [ subsec_2d ] suggests that the counter - rotating stars in ngc  770 are moving in a disk .",
    "thus , any plausible formation mechanism must explain the counter - rotation , the age difference between the core and main galaxy body as well as the presence of a central disk .",
    "a minor merging event which did not destroy ngc  770 but did provide material with very different angular momentum can explain the observed counter - rotating core in this galaxy .",
    "evidence that the counter - rotating stars rotate in a disk suggests that the merged galaxy contained a significant gas fraction .",
    "if the core was formed in such a scenario , the galaxy which merged with ngc  770 would necessarily be a small dwarf galaxy . in ",
    "[ sec_disk ] , we estimate that the inner disky region of ngc  770 contains @xmath113% of the total galaxy light .",
    "if we attribute this to the counter - rotating component , it corresponds to an absolute luminosity of @xmath114 or a mass of @xmath115 modulo the unknown gas fraction in such a progenitor and the efficiency of star formation in low - mass mergers .",
    "the abundance of hi gas in the ngc  772/770 system makes it possible that the counter - rotating core formed via gas accretion from the primary galaxy .",
    "it appears from figure  [ fig_hi ] that ngc  770 is affecting the hi gas distribution of ngc  772 .",
    "however , these current interactions have a dynamical timescale that is much shorter than the inferred age of the counter - rotating disk .",
    "thus , this gas accretion would have had to have occurred two to three orbits ago in ngc  770 s motion around its primary galaxy .",
    "although it may be possible , it is unlikely that gas from the primary galaxy would be accreted by the smaller perturbing galaxy far from the center of mass of the system .",
    "ngc  770 is the faintest known galaxy to host a core which counter - rotates with respect to the main galaxy kinematics .",
    "@xcite propose an alternative formation mechanism for kinematically - distinct cores in low luminosity ellipticals in which angular momentum is transfered to the halo of a dwarf galaxy during flyby encounters with more massive galaxies .",
    "these authors present observations of two dwarf elliptical galaxies ( @xmath116 ) with cores rotating in the same direction as the main galaxy body , but with slower rotation speeds .",
    "in these two systems , the kinematic decoupling observed between the core and halo can be explained via galaxy interactions . in the case of ngc  770 ,",
    "the maximum angular momentum transfer during its current encounter between ngc  770 and its parent galaxy is @xmath117 km  s@xmath1(assuming a relative velocity of 120 km  s@xmath1 , separation distance of 32kpc , and primary galaxy mass @xmath118 ; c.f .",
    "eqn.7 of @xcite ) . to explain the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 , which rotates with a maximum velocity of 21 km  s@xmath1  in a direction opposite the main galaxy , would require either an unreasonably large number of orbits at the current separation , or fewer orbits at a closer physical separation .",
    "thus , interactions are an unlikely formation mechanism for the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 .    of the above formation models , we favor the scenario in which the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 was formed during a minor merging event with a smaller dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite have noted that dwarf - dwarf merging is unlikely in galaxy - rich groups and clusters due to large relative velocities between galaxies . in the low galaxy density environment of ngc  770 , the low relative velocities ( @xmath119 km  s@xmath1 ) suggests that ngc  770 could have captured a smaller dwarf galaxy for impact parameters less than a few tens of kpc .",
    "if the merging scenario is correct , ngc  770 is an excellent example of merging at dwarf - sized galaxy scales .",
    "we present evidence for a counter - rotating core in the low - luminosity elliptical galaxy ngc  770 based on keck / esi and gemini / gmos ifu spectroscopy .",
    "the combined one- and two - dimensional kinematics argue for a kinematically - distinct core rotating counter to the main galaxy body with maximum rotation speed of @xmath120 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the counter - rotating region is misaligned with the main body of the galaxy by @xmath5 .",
    "we present evidence that stars in the counter - rotating region are confined to a disk with radius @xmath74 ( 0.6kpc ) and we estimate an upper limit to the scale disk height of @xmath4 ( 0.1kpc ) .",
    "we compute an age and metallicity of the inner counter - rotating region of @xmath6gyr and [ fe / h ] = @xmath121dex , based on lick absorption - line indices .",
    "we discuss several possible formation scenarios for the counter - rotating core in ngc  770 and favor one in which the core was formed in a minor merging event with a smaller dwarf galaxy .",
    "if this scenario is correct , it represents one of the few known examples of merging between two dwarf - sized galaxies .",
