    "optical surveys for quasars have often exploited the ultraviolet - excess ( uvx ) and power - law nature of the typical quasar spectrum .",
    "such searches have yielded tens of thousands of quasars with broad emission lines and blue optical colors ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "although all quasars _ may _ be intrinsically blue in color , the presence of dust along the line - of - sight to a quasar s central engine will redden the observed spectrum .",
    "furthermore , quasars that are dimmed due to extinction will be selected against in magnitude - limited optical surveys , further biasing quasar number counts and affecting both the observed quasar luminosity function and its apparent evolution over cosmic time .",
    "@xcite argue that the presence of dust is responsible for the redder than average spectral energy distributions of low - ionization broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos and has led to an underestimate of the fraction of these objects in the general quasar population .",
    "additionally , examples of low - ionization bal qsos with unusually high balmer decrements and red optical colors have supported a model in which quasars are buried in thick , dusty shrouds during an early phase of evolution @xcite",
    "@xcite have suggested that a large population of quasars has gone undetected as a result of such biased searches .",
    "they utilized a sample of sources from the parkes catalog brighter than 0.5 jy at 2.7 ghz with flat radio spectra ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 colors of their quasars range between 1 and 8 .",
    "this is a much broader color distribution than that of optically selected quasars whose optical to near - infrared colors are virtually all in the range @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite argue that if dust - obscured quasars are extinguished by several magnitudes in the optical ( @xmath10 ) , then a magnitude - limited optical survey would only detect intrinsically luminous red quasars .",
    "fainter quasars , extinguished by dust , will fall below a survey s magnitude limit and will not be detected .",
    "if the same amount of reddening occurs in radio - quiet quasars as is found in the 0.5  jy sources , then this extinction has caused @xmath11 of quasars to be missed by optical surveys .",
    "@xcite arrived at a similar conclusion for gravitationally lensed quasars after finding much redder optical to near - infrared colors in radio - selected lenses compared to optically - selected ones .",
    "they atribute the red colors partly to dust in the lensing galaxies and partly to dust intrinsic to the quasars .",
    "@xcite searched for the radio - quiet analog of the red quasar population using x - ray selection from rosat archival data .",
    "their results suggest that only @xmath12 of quasars at a given intrinsic x - ray flux are obscured .",
    "other studies have shown equally discrepant results leading to no firm conclusion on the matter @xcite    spectulation has also arisen as to the source of the reddening .",
    "@xcite argue that the reddening in their quasar sample is due to dust obscuration .",
    "however , the case has also been made for a red synchrotron component contributing to the near - infrared flux and causing the red colors in flat - spectrum radio - selected quasars @xcite .",
    "other constributions to the spread in @xmath8 colors may come from contamination by host galaxy starlight @xcite and/or an intrinsic spread in the optical continuum slope @xcite .",
    "the emergence of 2mass , a large - area near - infrared survey , provides the opportunity for a flux - limited @xmath13-band survey with the potential to at least partially recover this elusive quasar population .    in this paper",
    "we present a new approach to finding this obscured population of quasars by searching for sources that are detectable both in the radio and near infrared but are optically faint .",
    "we present an empirical method using optical to near - infrared colors to select out high - probablility quasar candidates .",
    "we provide an estimate for the spatial density of this missing population and compare it to the previously detected quasar spatial density function . in section 2",
    "we discuss the initial sample selection criteria , while our optical spectroscopic followup observations are presented in  3 .",
    "we go on to refine our color selection criteria (  4 ) and compare the surface density of the objects on the sky to previous quasar surveys (  5 ) , allowing us to assess quantitatively the missing component of the population . in section 6",
    "we discuss biases and incompletenesses in our , and previous , quasar surveys .",
    "we conclude (  7 ) with a discussion of future plans to improve and broaden our understanding of the red quasar population .",
    "we describe here our method to search for optically obscured quasars , incorporating information from radio , infrared , and optical catalogs .",
    "we begin by defining an initial sample using three criteria : ( 1 ) the object must be in the first catalog ; ( 2 ) it must be in the 2mass catalog , and ( 3 ) it must be fainter than the plate limit of the first generation palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - i ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the three surveys .    the first survey @xcite is a radio imaging project intended to serve as the 20-cm wavelength counterpart to the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) .",
    "the july 2000 catalog covered 7988 deg@xmath14 of sky and contained 722,354 primarily extragalactic sources with subarcsecond positions .",
    "the survey is ideal for selecting optically obscured quasars .",
    "its 1 mjy flux density limit gives us the advantage of detecting qso s down into the radio - quiet regime @xcite , allowing a search for optically obscured quasars over a broad range of radio luminosities .",
    "the positional accuracy of the survey ( @xmath15 ) allows us to reliably find optical counterparts to sources and/or to create a list of objects without optical counterparts .",
    "the optically faint radio sources are excellent candidates for highly obscured agn .",
    "the two micron all sky survey @xcite began imaging the sky in 1997 using two 1.3 meter telescopes at mt .",
    "hopkins , az , and ctio , chile . the final release has covered @xmath16 of the sky in three near - infrared wavebands : @xmath17m@xmath18 , @xmath19m@xmath18 , and @xmath20m@xmath18 . with 4  resolution and an astrometric accuracy of @xmath21 ,",
    "a signal - to - noise of 10 at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 mag has been achieved for point sources .",
    "these limits correspond to a flux density of about 1 mjy in each band .",
    "sources with fainter magnitudes down to @xmath25 are detected , but with lower signal - to - noise and considerable incompleteness .",
    "the second incremental release , which we have used in this experiment , reports a sky coverage of 19,681 deg@xmath14 containing more than 160 million point sources .",
    "the 2mass second incremental release is made up of 27,493 tiles .",
    "each tile represents a @xmath26 long scan from south to north and is @xmath27 wide in right ascension .",
    "the overlap between first and 2mass is broken up by these tiles which are not necessarily adjacent . to determine the coverage area of our survey we counted the first sources that fell inside the four corners of each 2mass tile .",
    "since the first sources are extragalactic and uniformly distributed on the sky , the fraction of first sources that fall inside a 2mass tile represents the fraction of the first coverage area included in both surveys .",
    "a total of 244,988 first sources lie in the 2mass survey area ( @xmath28 of the total july 2000 first catalog ) , establishing our survey size to be 2716 deg@xmath14 .",
    "we matched the first sources with the 2mass catalog out to offsets of 12  in order to determine the optimal search radius for selecting counterparts .",
    "we also matched the 2mass catalog to a false first catalog generated by shifting the entire first catalog by 5  to the north .",
    "figure 1 shows a histogram of first-2mass separations .",
    "integrating under the two curves out to 2  shows that @xmath29 of our matches to this radius are physically associated .",
    "this yields an optically unbiased sample of 12,435 sources ( denoted f2 m hereafter ) .",
    "given the relatively low resolution of 2mass data , we restricted our matches to objects with a stellar 2mass morphological classification ( ext_flg = 0 ) .    the cambridge automated plate machine @xcite has digitized the poss - i photographic plates at a resolution of 05 .",
    "the catalog produced by these scans includes all objects detected down to the plate limits , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we used the apm - first catalog which contains all matched objects with separations up to 20  @xcite to search for unidentified objects from our f2 m source list .",
    "we matched our f2 m list to the apm - first catalog with a search radius of 2 .",
    "a total of 10,500 sources had matches in the apm catalog , leaving 1,935 objects unmatched . a false catalog , produced by shifting f2 m by 5  to the north , produced 33 matches with a separation closer than 2 , a @xmath32 false rate .",
    "several factors cause optical sources associated with a f2 m object to be mistakenly listed as unmatched. the most common error is caused by objects that lie in parts of the sky not included in the apm catalog .",
    "we used the gsc2.2 catalog to help solve this problem for sources brighter than @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the guide star catalog ii ( gsc ii ) is an all - sky optical catalog from the second generation palomar observatory and uk schmidt sky surveys .",
    "a subset of this effort , gsc2.2 , is a magnitude - limited catalog which has been made publicly available .",
    "it contains about 450 million objects brighter than 18.5 in photographic @xmath35 and 19.5 in photographic @xmath36 .",
    "we used a subset of this catalog , produced by matching first against gsc 2.2 out to radius of 24 .",
    "we matched this catalog , containing 292,032 sources , to the 1,935 f2 m objects with no apm counterpart to remove bright optical sources .",
    "we used a matching radius of 2  which yielded 1354 matches . a false catalog , produced by shifting f2 m by 5  to the north produced 3 matches with a separation closer than 2 .",
    "since our objective was to find optically _ faint _ sources , our interest lies with the remaining 581 f2 m sources with neither apm nor gsc2.2 counterparts .",
    "sources fainter than the gsc2.2 magnitude limit and brighter than the poss - i plate limit had to be removed by hand .",
    "we conducted a visual inspection of all 581 sources using postage stamp cutouts from the first generation digitized sky survey to select sources which were not visible or are very faint on the plate images .",
    "we then compared the image statistics of both the undetected , apm- scanned sources and the unscanned , visually inspected sources . using a @xmath37 pixel square ( @xmath38 ) around the center of each apm - scanned source , we used the iraf task imstat to measure the brightest pixel and the number of standard deviations ( @xmath39 ) above background , to quantify the sensitivity of the apm scans .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of @xmath40 ( with a gaussian fit overplotted ) for the sources scanned but undetected by apm .",
    "we repeated these measurements on the sources from regions of the sky not covered in the apm catalog and removed sources which were brighter than @xmath41 above background , which , as shown in figure 3 , implies a @xmath16 probability that the apm machine would not have detected them .",
    "we also removed from our sample the six sources in figure 3 that had counts more than @xmath41 above the background .",
    "we also found , through visual inspection , that another common error involved f2 m objects whose separations from their optical counterparts were slightly greater than 2 .",
    "we removed by hand galaxies , several arcseconds in size , whose nominal optical positions were more than 2  away from the radio positions , but which were clearly associated with the same object . for fainter sources ( apm @xmath42 ) , we used statistics derived from @xcite to estimate the probability that a nearby apm source was in fact associated with the f2 m source .",
    "the probabilities of real association ranged from @xmath43 to @xmath16 depending on the separation and apm morphology of the source .",
    "we then summed the probabilities of association @xmath44 starting with the lowest until the total reached @xmath45 ; the addition of these ten sources to the sample would thus mean the mistaken inclusion of @xmath46 real optical detections to the list of putatively undetected radio - ir sources .",
    "the sum of @xmath47 for the remaining objects was @xmath48 , implying an incompleteness of @xmath49 sources ( objects that we take to be optically identified radio - ir sources but which are in fact chance coincidences ; all of these had probabilities of matching of @xmath50 ) .",
    "the final sample including the ten low - probability matches then includes 69 objects and is @xmath51 reliable ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath51 complete ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "spectroscopy of our candidate quasars was carried out in the optical and near - infrared at four different observatories .",
    "the majority of the optical spectra were obtained at the 10 m keck telecopes using the esi and , to a lesser extent , lris spectrographs .",
    "optical spectra were also obtained at the 3 m shane telescope at lick observatory .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy was performed at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) using spex @xcite and at the mdm observatory on kitt peak using the tifkam infrared camera in spectroscopic mode .",
    "we also obtained seven spectra from the sloan digital sky survey spectral database .",
    "the lris data were reduced and spectra extracted using standard iraf procedures .",
    "esi spectra were produced using a combination of iraf tasks and customized software developed by the authors .",
    "more details on the algorithms used in the esi software are given in @xcite .",
    "the near infrared spectra obtained at irtf with spex were reduced using spextool @xcite .",
    "we flux calibrated and corrected the data for telluric absorption using spectra of nearby a0v stars observed immediately before or after each object spectrum , following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "the near infrared spectra obtained with tifkam at mdm were extracted and reduced using standard spectral reduction tasks in the iraf package onedspec .",
    "we used both a0v and g2v stars ( to calibrate the hydrogen absorption lines in the a0v star ) when correcting these spectra for telluric absorption , following @xcite .",
    "we classified our spectra using algortihms in the radial velocity analysis ( rv ) package of iraf .",
    "we used the fxcor task to cross - correlate the spectra with a set of galaxy and star templates , implementing the technique illustrated in @xcite .",
    "our templates consisted of elliptical , s0 , sa , sb , sc and starburst galaxies from @xcite and @xcite . of the six available templates , this spectrum had the highest reddening ; it was chosen as most consistent with our survey s selection criteria . ] .",
    "this task was most useful in classifying and assigning redshifts for the absorption line galaxies .",
    "we used the tonry & davis @xmath54 value to determine the strength of the correlation , rejecting identifications with @xmath55 .",
    "some spectra with emission features were misidentified as starbursts , but were assigned correct redshifts ; others did not correlate at all . in the latter cases we used the rv task rvidlines to measure radial velocities from spectral lines using emission features present in the quasar composite spectrum from @xcite as well as the first three paschen lines .",
    "we then fit gaussian profiles to the emission lines and classifed objects with line widths @xmath56 km / s as quasars .",
    "objects with narrow lines were classified as starbursts or narrow - line agn based on [ o iii]/h@xmath57 and [ n ii]/h@xmath58 line diagnostics @xcite .",
    "table 2 summarizes all the data collected on our quasar candidates .",
    "columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) list the candidates j2000 coordinates from the first catalog . in columns ( 3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) we list the @xmath59 and @xmath54 magnitudes , respectively , from the complete guide star 2 catalog which reaches the poss - ii plate limits .",
    "we chose to present these magnitudes despite our selection criteria which required that the objects be fainter than the apm limit , in order to allow for near - infrared to optical color studies which we discuss in the following sections . in columns ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) we present 2mass @xmath36,@xmath60 , and @xmath61 photometry , followed by the peak and integrated first 20 cm flux densities in columns ( 8) and ( 9 ) . in columns ( 10 ) and",
    "( 11 ) we present @xmath62 and @xmath63 colors .",
    "we used the @xmath54 magnitude from gsc2 for @xmath63 .",
    "we argue in  4 that these near - infrared and optical to near - infrared colors can be useful diagnostics for efficient selection of red quasars .",
    "we note , however , that the non - simultaneity of the poss - ii and 2mass observations make our colors provisional at best .",
    "we report the redshift of the candidate when available in column ( 12 ) , followed by the classification we determined using the aforementioned analysis in column ( 13 ) ; any other references in the literature are provided in column ( 14 ) .",
    "we have obtained optical and/or near - infrared spectra for 50 of the 69 optically faint f2 m candidates .",
    "twenty - three of these objects are some kind of agn , eighteen of which are bona fide quasars ( with line widths @xmath64 km@xmath65 ) .",
    "one of these quasars has a blue optical spectrum and may have been included due to variability between the poss - i and 2mass epochs or photometric errors in one of the surveys ( sdss photometry is similar to the gsc2 values ) .",
    "nineteen are galaxies ( eighteen red ellipticals and one emission line galaxy ) , and eight are stars , mostly type m or later .",
    "the spectra for the quasars are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "we scaled the optical spectrum to the near infrared spectrum by measuring the median value in their overlapping spectral region ( @xmath66 ) and scaling the spectrum with the lower median flux to that with the higher median flux .",
    "this approach to combining the optical and near - infrared spectra is correct in the absence of spectral variability between the epochs of optical and near - infrared observations ; it also assumes that there are no significant color gradients in the sources which would produce color changes in the face of differing amounts of slit losses during the inevitable changes of observing conditions from run to run .    in figure 4",
    "we plot the 69 sources in @xmath62 vs. @xmath63 color space . as expected , there are more red quasars ( @xmath67 ) at redder @xmath62 and @xmath63 colors .",
    "more interestingly , galaxies ( @xmath68 ) tend to be found at bluer @xmath63 and slightly bluer @xmath62 colors .",
    "stars ( @xmath69 ) , on the other hand , have rather red @xmath63 colors similar to those of the red quasars , but are _ much _ bluer in @xmath62 .",
    "the agn ( @xmath70 ) occupy the same part of this space as the quasars .",
    "two of the red quasars , f2 m j082502.0 + 471651 and f2 m j165647.1 + 382136 ( plotted in figure 3 ) , showed only narrow emission lines in their keck esi spectra , but had clear broad paschen-@xmath57 in the near - infrared .",
    "had we not observed these objects in the near infrared , they would have been classified as narrow - line agn .",
    "another narrow - line agn for which we obtained both an optical and a near - infrared spectrum , f2 m j073806.0 + 214103 , showed only narrow pa-@xmath58 in the @xmath13-band .",
    "however , it is quite possible that one or more of the four remaining narrow - line agn found in our survey which have no corresponding near - infrared spectrum may have broad paschen lines and thus may in the future be promoted to red quasars ( cf .",
    "rawlings et al .",
    "1995 ) .    of the nineteen galaxies identified in this survey , only three have both an optical and a near - infrared spectrum : elliptical galaxies f2 m j011712.7 - 012755 and f2 m j144812.1 + 305614 , and the emission line galaxy f2 m j141736.2 + 225346 .",
    "the remaining sixteen objects only have optical spectra . since it is possible for a quasar to be reddened sufficiently that its host galaxy light dominates the optical spectrum , the lack of a near - infrared spectrum which could reveal broad paschen lines can lead to an incorrect classification ( similar to the case of the narrow - line agn discussed above ) .",
    "furthermore , galaxy light in such an object can affect its optical to near - infrared colors , preventing it from being targeted as a quasar candidate in a color - color selection scheme ( see below ) .",
    "if we separate the populations with a color cut at @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( the dotted lines in figure 4 ) we can analyze our quasar detection efficiency in color - color space .",
    "there are 31 objects with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "thirty of these objects have been classified : 14 red quasars ( @xmath75 ) , 1 blue quasar ( @xmath76 ) , 5 narrow - line agn ( @xmath77 ) , 9 galaxies ( @xmath78 ) , and 1 star ( @xmath76 ) . with these color criteria",
    "we have a success rate of nearly @xmath2 for finding red quasars .    for the 38 objects with @xmath79 or @xmath80 we have obtained 20 identifications : 1 emission - line galaxy ( @xmath81 ) , 9 galaxies ( @xmath82 ) , 7 stars ( @xmath83 ) , and 3 red quasars .",
    "all three quasars are consistent within the errors of lying inside the boundaries of the red quasar color space defined above .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that adopting our color cuts produces a high efficiency for detecting red quasars and largely avoids galaxies and stars .",
    "the @xmath62 color region in which the quasars in this survey lie is consistent with the results of @xcite who serched for red agn using a @xmath84 color cut on objects in the 2mass point source catalog with no optical or radio constraints and found @xmath85 red agn , mostly with @xmath86 .",
    "only two of these quasars have @xmath87 ; f2 m j092145.6 + 191812 is recovered in this survey .",
    "@xcite use quasars from the @xcite quasar catalog with 2mass counterparts to argue that a two - color selection method ( with one of the colors extending over a long wavelength baseline ) is an efficient way to select quasars .",
    "the addition of a second color - constraint may explain the higher redshift objects found in this survey .",
    "our results are also consistent with the ideas put forth by @xcite who argue that although optically red stars ( such as the m stars detected in our survey ) and red quasars will have similar spectral energy distributions in the optical , the blackbody shape of the stellar spectrum will deviate from the power law shape of the quasar spectrum in the infrared .",
    "they suggest using optical to infrared colors ( such as our @xmath63 ) in conjunction with infrared colors ( such as @xmath62 ) to separate stars from quasars in a manner insensitive to reddening .",
    "we note that the fraction of spectroscopically identified objects in our sample depends rather strongly on @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "figure 5 shows a histogram of the @xmath13 magnitudes binned by 0.25 magnitudes .",
    "the unshaded histogram includes all 69 candidates .",
    "we overplot a histogram shaded with vertical lines for the 50 spectroscopically identified objects .",
    "the bins containing the 17 red quasars are colored black .",
    "we have identifications for @xmath11 of the objects",
    "brighter than @xmath88 , but only @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "although the efficiency of finding red quasars decreases for objects with smaller @xmath63 values ( which necessarily have fainter @xmath13 magnitudes due to our @xmath91 restriction ) , it is possible that there are more quasars at fainter @xmath13 magnitudes . therefore , we restrict our comparison between this sample and optically selected samples to objects brighter than @xmath88 and account for this incompleteness in the following discussion .",
    "we wish to compare the spatial density of the red quasars in our sample to the general quasar population in order to determine the fraction of quasars missed by uvx selection methods . using a small magellanic cloud ( smc ) dust reddening law from @xcite , we find that a @xmath92 quasar with @xmath93 will suffer @xmath94 magnitudes of extinction in the observed - frame @xmath59-band while in the observed - frame @xmath13-band the amount of extinction is only @xmath95 magnitudes . at @xmath96",
    "the extinction in @xmath13 rises to @xmath97 magnitudes compared with @xmath98 magnitudes of extinction in @xmath59 . therefore ,",
    "if we compare spatial density distributions of quasars as a function of @xmath13 magnitude , as opposed to the traditional @xmath59 magnitude , we largely avoid comparing luminous dust - extinguished ( and therefore optically faint ) quasars with unextinguished blue quasars with much lower luminosities .",
    "although the surface density of uvx - selected quasars has been determined as a function of @xmath59 magnitude or its equivalent @xcite no such determination has been published to date in the @xmath13 band . in order to construct an optically selected sample that is comparable to our red quasars , we need to compare our sample with quasars whose optical magnitude limit approaches the plate limit of poss - i and which are also detected in first and 2mass .",
    "figure 6 compares the sky density of our f2 m red quasars to quasars selected in optical magnitude - limited surveys .",
    "we describe below the method by which we determine the @xmath13 magnitude surface density on the sky for quasars .",
    "the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) selects quasars by matching first sources to the apm catalog .",
    "the resultant samples are magnitude - limited in the optical photographic @xmath99 ( red ) band and obey the color criterion @xmath100 .",
    "we calculated their surface density as a function of @xmath13 magnitude by matching the fbqs to the 2mass all sky data release .",
    "the fbqs ii @xcite contains 636 quasars in 2682 deg@xmath14 at an optical limit of @xmath101 magnitudes in the apm catalog .",
    "there were 503 2mass matches to fbqs ii .",
    "its optically fainter analog , fbqs iii @xcite , contains 321 quasars in 589 deg@xmath14 and has a magnitude limit of @xmath102 .",
    "there were 134 2mass detections in this sample . in figure 6",
    "we plot the surface density of these samples separately , as a function of @xmath13 magnitude , in 0.5 magnitude bins .",
    "fbqs ii and iii are represented by @xmath68 and @xmath103 symbols , respectively .",
    "we also constructed a uvx - selected sample by combining the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) described in @xcite and the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) described in @xcite .",
    "we use the subset of first- and 2mass - detected sources within these quasar catalogs to serve as a uvx - selected sample that is comparable to the f2 m red quasars .",
    "the lbqs survey contains 58 such detections in 270 deg@xmath14 in the optical magnitude range @xmath104 .",
    "the 2qz sample was matched to first by @xcite who found 104 matches in 122 deg@xmath14 .",
    "this list had nine matches in 2mass in the optical range @xmath105 .",
    "removing the two of these already listed in lbqs , yields a total sample of 65 unique uvx - selected quasars with first and 2mass matches .",
    "we combine this sample and scale the number counts by their respective coverage areas in order to have a continuous uvx - selected sample that extends effectively to the plate limit of poss - i ( @xmath106 symbols in figure 6 ) .",
    "since the final release of 2mass covers the whole sky , the unmatched quasars from the above samples must have @xmath13 magnitudes fainter than the 2mass detection limit , and hence would not have been detected in any quasar survey based on 2mass detections such as our optically faint f2 m sample .",
    "therefore , comparing the spatial density of these known quasars in the @xmath13 band using a first plus 2mass filter enables us to compare samples with uniform characteristics .    by comparing the distribution functions in figure 6",
    "we can determine the fraction of quasars that a @xmath13 magnitude - limited sample would recover versus one that is optically selected .",
    "we see that radio - selected and uvx - selected , radio - detected quasars have comparable surface densities in the @xmath13 band .",
    "the shapes of the optically bright and optically faint ( f2 m ) quasar distributions are also similar , but the f2 m blank field sample constitutes only a small fraction of the blue quasars .    as a further check that we are comparing objects from the same overall population , we plot in figure 7 the redshift distribution of the f2 m blank field survey quasars along with the fbqs ii and iii quasars that have been detected by 2mass .",
    "all three surveys span the same redshift range , and none shows a correlation of reddening with redshift .",
    "the slight upturn at redder @xmath8 colors toward low redshifts in the fbqs ii sample is likely due to added @xmath13-band light from the quasars host galaxies .",
    "we list the qso surface densities from the optical surveys along with those of the f2 m sample in table 3 .",
    "we derive the uncertainties using poisson statistics for the fbqs ii and iii as well as the uvx selected quasars . since the f2 m sample has identifications for only @xmath107 of the candidates ( @xmath11 for @xmath108 ) we must adjust the error bars on our spatial density measurements .",
    "we account for the incomplete spectroscopic identifications by making the most conservative assumption possible : that all the unobserved objects are quasars .",
    "we make this the upper limit on top of the poisson uncertainties for the quasar counts in this sample .",
    "the last line in the table gives the integrated surface density of all quasars brighter than @xmath88 .",
    "if the red quasars in the f2 m blank field sample are red due to dust extinction , then the optical surveys are missing objects whose extinction - corrected magnitudes would put them above the survey threshold , leading to an underestimate of the population .",
    "if we assume that these are otherwise normal quasars , then the @xmath13-band surface density in each optical survey ( @xmath109 ) _ plus _ the surface density of the f2 m blank field red quasars ( @xmath110 ) ought to represent the total surface density of quasars . by adding up the surface densities from the table we can determine what fraction of this total",
    "is made up of red quasars missed by optically selected samples ; the percentage of red quasars is    @xmath111    applying this to the data in table 3 , we determine that the uvx selection method misses @xmath112 of the quasars in a @xmath13-magnitude - limited sample .",
    "the fbqs ii and iii miss @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "these are strict lower limits to the fractions of missing red quasars , since both the uvx method and the fbqs surveys impose a color criterion on their candidates as well , and it is possible that there are red quasars detected on the poss - i plates redder than the fbqs color cut of @xmath115",
    ". these would be luminous optical objects , which may experience several magnitudes of extinction , yet still be bright enough to show up on poss - i .",
    "the f2 m blank field sample thus does not contain all the red quasars in the first-2mass list and we are currently working on a program to create a more complete list of red quasars .",
    "we note , however , that the percentages of missed quasars are unlikely to change by more than a factor of four or so once this intermediate population is identified ( see below ) .",
    "the f2 m blank field sample reported here is unique in that it contains both very highly reddened objects as well as quasars that come from the fainter end of the optical luminosity function and have been reddened just enough to make it into our survey .",
    "we have compared the surface densities of optically selected , radio - detected quasars to near - infrared - selected , radio - detected quasars as a function of apparent @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "the fraction of missing quasars derived from this comparison is valid for such magnitude - limited surveys .",
    "eventually , however , we would like to be able to make statements about the fraction of red quasars in the overall quasar population , and how the missing group of objects identified here affects the luminosity function of quasars .",
    "in this case it is not enough to use apparent magnitudes . in the following section we discuss the limitations of magnitude - limited surveys in the near - infrared and the optical wavelength regimes due to redshift and reddening .",
    "though the effects of dust are reduced when number counts on the sky are compared in the infrared , the effect of dust on the detectability of red quasars in the near - infrared increases with redshift .",
    "if the dust is at the same redshift as the quasar then rest frame optical light from high redshift ( @xmath116 ) quasars will be shifted into the @xmath60 and @xmath13-bands and will generate incompleteness even in a near - infrared survey .",
    "we will find highly reddened low - redshift quasars , but as we look at higher redshifts we will be biased toward lower extinctions and intrinsically more luminous objects .",
    "this bias was noted by @xcite in an @xmath117-band survey for quasars which found five quasars with @xmath118 , all at @xmath119 .",
    "these were also the most luminous quasars at their respective redshifts , after dereddening .    to determine the reddening of the quasars in the f2 m sample , we fit a quasar composite spectrum which spans uv to near - infrared rest wavelengths to our red quasar spectra .",
    "we use the fbqs composite spectrum @xcite for the uv and optical wavelengths @xmath120 .",
    "we also obtained near - infrared spectra at irtf with spex for ten ordinary quasars chosen from the sloan digital sky survey quasar catalog for which an absorption of zero has been assumed .",
    "these quasars have @xmath13-magnitudes ranging between 12 and 14.5 and are in the redshift range @xmath121 .",
    "we doppler corrected the spectra , normalized them to the mean flux in the @xmath122 m wavelength range and averaged them ( glikman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we scaled the near - infrared composite to the optical composite by matching the flux in the wavelength range @xmath123  and attaching them at @xmath124 , to create one spectrum extending from @xmath125 .",
    "we followed the method outlined in @xcite to redden this composite with a small magellanic cloud dust law from @xcite and fit it to our spectra , thereby determining @xmath126 .",
    "we then deredden the seventeen f2 m red quasars and plot their intrinsic absolute @xmath13-band magnitudes as a function of redshift in figure 8 .",
    "we compare them to the absolute magnitudes of fbqs ii and iii quasars for which no intrinsic absorption has been assumed .",
    "the five red quasars found by @xcite were the most luminous quasars in their sample .",
    "furthermore they are all found at relatively low redshift as a result of the detection limit of the survey .",
    "figure 8 shows that in the case of near - infrared - selected quasars we are able to detect highly reddened objects @xmath127 with typical absolute @xmath13-band luminosities out to @xmath128 . at higher redshifts",
    "however , near - infrared selection also begins to be affected by extinction .",
    "the red quasars detected at @xmath129 are the most luminous ( as well as having the least amount of extinction ) . in a survey with no optical constraints , with a given @xmath13-band magnitude limit",
    ", our data suggest that we would be able to detect most or all of the red quasars at low redshifts , but at higher redshifts our detection limit would prevent us from finding highly reddened quasars with normal intrinsic luminosities . the dashed lines in the figure show our detection limits for quasars at a given absolute @xmath13 magnitude , redshift , and extinction .",
    "redder quasars must be more luminous intrinsically to make it into a magnitude - limited survey , especially at @xmath87 . to recover these objects",
    "a deeper @xmath13-band survey is necessary .",
    "the trend of finding red quasars with smaller extinctions and higher intrinsic luminosities with increasing redshift is clear from figure 8 .",
    "however the two highest redshift , most luminous quasars ( f2 m j013435.6 - 093102 and f2 m j100424.8 + 122922 ) are both gravitationally lensed , and hence their high absolute magnitudes are partly due to magnification and should be treated as upper bounds .",
    "furthermore , in the case of f2 m j013435.6 - 093102 , @xcite present a reddening model which places the dust in a @xmath130 lensing galaxy and results in @xmath131 .",
    "our composite fit places the dust at the quasar s redshift and computes @xmath132 ( lower than the value of 0.67 found by @xcite ) .    in table 4",
    "we list the parameters extracted from our composite fits to the seventeen f2 m quasars which we order by decreasing redshift .",
    "columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) list the quasars j2000 coordinates .",
    "column ( 3 ) lists the 2mass apparent @xmath13 magnitude followed by @xmath133 , the amount of absorption in @xmath13 , in column ( 4 ) .",
    "column ( 5 ) lists the fitted @xmath126 used in shading the points in figure 8 . in column",
    "( 6 ) we present the radio - loudness parameter followed by the redshift in column ( 7 ) .    for a given total extinction ,",
    "the amount of absorption in the observed @xmath13-band increases with redshift . correcting",
    "the @xmath13 magnitudes of the f2 m quasars by their fitted @xmath133 values shifts the apparent @xmath13 magnitudes by @xmath1340.3 - 1.2 magnitudes and lowers the intrinsic magnitude limit of our survey to @xmath13515.0 ( ignoring the nineteen candidates for which we do not have spectra ) .",
    "if we apply the spatial densities of the seventeen f2 m quasars ( 0.006 deg@xmath136 ) and quasars from fbqs i and ii brighter than @xmath137 ( 0.103 deg@xmath136 and 0.08 deg@xmath136 , respectively ) to equation ( 1 ) we find that the percentage of red quasars in this intrinsic - magnitude - limited sample increases .",
    "the fbqs ii and iii therefore miss @xmath138 .",
    "the radio - loudness distribution of the f2 m quasars listed in column ( 7 ) of table 4 was calculated using the definition @xmath139 as the ratio of radio to optical power : @xmath140ghz@xmath141 .",
    "the `` radio - loud '' regime is entered when @xmath142 , while `` radio - quiet '' objects are generally designated as those with @xmath143 . ] without including a @xmath13-correction .",
    "we computed @xmath144 by correcting the @xmath59 magnitude from table 2 by the @xmath145 values which we obtained from the composite fits .",
    "an @xmath54 value of 10 divides the radio - loud and radio - quiet regimes , though objects in the range @xmath146 are seen as radio intermediate .",
    "the majority of fbqs sources lie in this range , as do about two thirds of the f2 m quasars .    in this work",
    ", we have assumed that the red quasars in the f2 m sample are dust reddened .",
    "however , the spectral slope in the radio may provide further information on the source of a red quasar s optical to near - infrared colors .",
    "@xcite argued that enhanced synchrotron emission from relativistic jets lying in the line of sight contributes to a quasar s near - infrared flux and is responsible for the large spread of @xmath8 colors in the parkes half - jansky flat - radio - spectrum quasar sample of @xcite .",
    "@xcite looked for a synchrotron signature in the spectral energy distributions of the parkes red quasars and found evidence for a red synchrotron component in @xmath147 of the sources . to determine if the quasars in our survey have flat radio spectra , we are obtaining contemporaneous 3.6 cm and 20 cm flux density measurements of the 17 quasars in our survey with the vla , we reserve a detailed study of the reddening for a future publication ( glikman et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "unextinguished , normal blue quasars have a typical @xmath148 as was demonstrated by @xcite using the colors of 26 lbqs quasars .",
    "we find this to be equally true for the fbqs ii and iii samples . in figure 9",
    "we plot the @xmath13 band surface density function for the fbqs ii and iii quasars listed in table 3 .",
    "these points are plotted with @xmath106 and @xmath149 symbols , repectively , and connected with lines .",
    "we also calculated and plotted `` fake '' @xmath13 band magnitudes from the @xmath150 magnitudes listed in the fbqs ii and iii catalogs ( @xmath151 , @xmath69 and @xmath103 symbols , respectively ) .",
    "between @xmath152 the real and fake points are remarkably close .",
    "the discrepancies at @xmath153 arise due to the small number of bright quasars . at fainter magnitudes",
    "the functions diverge due to incompleteness in the 2mass catalog .",
    "the fake points therefore have slightly higher spatial densities at fainter @xmath13 since they were calculated from their measured optical magnitudes .",
    "this further bolsters the case that optical selection of quasars produces a uniform subgroup of objects not representative of the overall quasar population : it misses red quasars . in figure 10",
    "we plot the @xmath8 color distribution of the fbqs ii and iii quasars that were detected by 2mass .",
    "we scaled the number counts to each survey s respective coverage area so that we are again comparing surface densities , this time as a function of color .",
    "we compare this to the color distribution of the f2 m red quasars which seems to be the tail end of the @xmath8 color distribution for first-2mass quasars .",
    "the dearth of objects at @xmath154 is due to our survey s own selection criterion which requires that objects be too faint to show up on the poss plates .",
    "this restriction automatically forces @xmath155 .",
    "at a given extinction in the observed @xmath59-band , ( @xmath145 ) , we can determine the intrinsic @xmath59 magnitude range of quasars that would fall within and outside the f2 m blank field survey s optical constraints .",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic color of most quasar continua is @xmath156 then the intrinsic optical magnitude limit of the f2 m blank field survey , given the 2mass limit of @xmath4 , is @xmath157 . because these objects are not detected on the poss - i plates , @xmath158 .",
    "it is possible , however , for a @xmath159 magnitude object that is extinguished by 3 magnitudes to be missed by this survey , since it _ will _ appear on the poss - i plates .",
    "uvx selection methods will likely not find it because of its colors .",
    "figure 10 shows that fbqs iii does detect redder quasars than fbqs ii due to its deeper optical limit . however , an fbqs equivalent survey extending to the apm detection limit is unlikely recover any new 2mass detected sources .",
    "these objects would necessarily have @xmath160 , conflicting with the survey s @xmath100 color constraint .",
    "any incompleteness in the red quasar population that arises due to our optical constraints can be recovered in a survey for red quasars using the color selection discussed in  4 , without regard to their detection or non - detection by the apm scans of poss - i .",
    "these intermediate objects should fill in the gap between the fbqs and f2 m @xmath8 color distributions .",
    "we have begun a program to search for objects detected on the poss - i plates using the @xmath161 and @xmath73 color selection criteria developed here .",
    "we use preliminary results from this program to estimate the number of quasars that would be added to our survey and have found 137 objects in first-2mass , including the thirty - one objects found in this survey , meeting the aforementioned color criteria .",
    "we use the gsc2.3 catalog to obtain the @xmath54 magnitudes ( photographic @xmath35 ) for the @xmath63 color cuts .",
    "since two of our red quasars fall outside this region , this expanded catalog contains fifteen of the seventeen red quasars listed here .",
    "if we assume that half of these objects will be quasars , as was true for the optically faint subset , then we expect to find a total of about seventy red quasars in the same region of sky .",
    "this is roughly a factor of four more quasars than were found in this survey , which raises the percentage of red quasars in the overall quasar population to between @xmath162 and @xmath163 in a magnitude - limited sample . as we showed in section 6.1",
    ", these percentages should increase by a factor of about 1.5 after correcting for absorption in the @xmath13-band .",
    "we have conducted a survey to search for optically obscured , infrared - bright quasars , detected in both the first and 2mass surveys .",
    "we required that the objects be undetected by the apm scans of the poss - i plates . using these criteria we obtained a list of 69 candidates .",
    "of the 51 spectroscopically observed candidates , 17 were red quasars . from the optical and near infrared colors of the candidates we have shown that red quasar detection efficiency rises to @xmath164 when adopting the color criteria @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "while the near - infrared is helpful in finding red quasars because of its weaker sensitivity to dust extinction , its effectiveness diminishes with redshift and increased obscuration . to evaluate the significance of red quasars to the whole quasar population it is necessary to characterize the distribution of @xmath126 as a function of intrinsic luminosity and redshift . with a sample of seventeen quasars",
    "this can not yet be accomplished .",
    "we have made some estimates of the percentage of red quasars which range from a firm lower limit from directly detected and classified optically faint objects of @xmath165 , to an extinction- and survey - bias - corrected best estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "future work will include a wider survey for red quasars taking advantage of the all - sky coverage of the latest 2mass release .",
    "we will also eliminate optical magnitude constraints and will select candidates based solely on their optical and near - infrared colors .",
    "we intend to study the reddening of these objects in greater detail by calculating balmer decrements and comparing unreddened spectra to quasar composites made from optically selected samples to search for any intrinsic differences between the two populations .",
