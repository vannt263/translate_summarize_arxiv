    "the financial stocks are complex , nonlinear , open systems characterized by a large number of parameters . among other features , they present a _ multifractal _ behavior @xcite . whether or not the multifractality is intrinsic or apparent is still an open question @xcite .",
    "several interesting multifractal models @xcite have been developed over the last decade .",
    "for example , the multifractal random walk model , introduced by barcy and collaborators @xcite has been recently shown to explain , besides the multifractality , other features of financial time  series , such as the absence of correlations between price variations and long - range volatility correlations .",
    "other multifractal models have been proposed @xcite to account for the asymmetry of the volatility - return correlation function .",
    "an important step toward a better understanding of such intricate dynamical processes is to search for new methods that are able to provide information about their temporal evolution .",
    "one way to explore the temporal evolution of a stochastic system such as a fluctuating stock price , denoted by @xmath14 , is by measuring the _ persistence probability , @xmath3_. that is the probability of the stochastic variable @xmath14 not reaching its original value corresponding to the starting time @xmath15 up to a later time @xmath16 .",
    "this concept , closely related to the first  passage probability , has been successfully implemented in surface growth phenomena @xcite and has been used to determine the universality class and the nonlinear features of the underlying dynamical process through the exponent @xmath11 associated with the power  law decay @xmath10 of the persistence probability at large times .",
    "alternatively , one is interested in measuring the survival probability @xmath2 which is defined as the probability of the stock price remaining above a reference value up to time @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast with the persistence probability , we show that the survival probability depends independently on both the total measurement time @xmath9 and the time between successive recordings , i.e. , the sampling time @xmath4 .",
    "the concepts of persistence and first  passage time have been recently introduced in econophysics @xcite . despite the capacity of first ",
    "passage statistical tools to predict the degree of performance of a given stock ( i.e. , how long a stock remains above a certain value , what is the first time when it reaches a particular level ) , it is quite intriguing that their use in understanding the evolution of financial markets is rather scarce .",
    "our study emphasizes the potential of the survival and persistence probabilities in any time series investigations and shows how these concepts can be connected to the traditional analysis @xcite based on the time evolution of price",
    " price correlation functions .",
    "we also point out the _ extended self  similar _ behavior manifested by the stock price correlation functions .",
    "extended self ",
    "similarity was originally observed in fluid turbulence problems @xcite and subsequently in discrete stochastic surface growth models @xcite .",
    "therefore we combine features from very different fields , such as surface growth , econophysics of stock markets , and fluid dynamics in an effort towards understanding the temporal evolution of financial stocks .",
    "our statistical study of stock market temporal fluctuations is motivated primarily by the availability of the huge amount of quantitative data on the stock market prices both for individual stocks as well as for aggregate stock indices and both for instantaneous minute  to  minute price fluctuations as well as large ",
    "scale fluctuations over several years .",
    "such detailed and precise quantitative information about the time dependence of a far  from  equilibrium stochastic process is not easy to find in real physical systems . for example , temporal thermal fluctuations of steps on solid surfaces , which we have recently analyzed @xcite to study the persistence and survival properties of equilibrium step fluctuations , usually provide reliable time dependent data only over a couple of decades .",
    "similarly , experimental studies @xcite of kinetic surface roughening in interface growth , which have served as model problems for developing the concepts of dynamical scaling in nonequilibrium growth phenomena , usually have reliable data for a couple of decades in growth time .",
    "the availability of extensive quantitative information on stock prices , including minute  to  minute price fluctuations within a single day as well as prices spanning over years ( or even decades for some stocks and index averages ) , therefore provides an almost unique opportunity to statistically analyze a time ",
    "dependent non  markovian stochastic phenomenon using actual `` experimental '' data covering many decades in time , in contract to the corresponding experimental studies of real physical systems which span only a few decades in time .",
    "it should consequently be possible to obtain definitive information about the persistence and survival behavior of stock price fluctuations studied as a non  markovian stochastic phenomenon .",
    "the availability of extensive stock price data should also allow for a detailed multifractal analysis of stock price fluctuations , which could serve , in principle , as a quantitative measure of `` volatility '' in the stock market since multifractality is directly related to intermittency and intermittency arises from the finite probability for very large scale fluctuations .",
    "our work presented in this article should therefore be thought of as a detailed empirical `` experimental '' analysis of a non  markovian dynamical stochastic process , namely the stock market , from the specific perspectives of first ",
    "passage statistics ( i.e. , persistence and survival probabilities and exponents ) and intermittency ( i.e. , multifractality and volatility ) .",
    "our motivation for studying this specific problem is the existence of huge amount of experimental data ( i.e. , stock prices ) of very wide dynamical range .",
    "the fact that there is widespread current interest in the statistical physics community in the subject of `` econophysics '' , which is nothing but the study of economics using the principles and methodologies of statistical mechanics , gives our current work some broad context , but our own interest is , however , complementary  we are using the vast amount of available dynamical data on stock price fluctuations to carry out an `` experimental '' study of the important first ",
    "passage statistical concepts of persistence and survival in non  markovian stochastic phenomena .",
    "the current work is , in some sense , a continuation of our earlier work on understanding various stochastic phenomena ( i.e. thermal step fluctuations @xcite and nonequilibrium surface growth @xcite ) from the first ",
    "passage statistics perspective  here the stochastic process under consideration being an economic phenomenon ( i.e. stock price fluctuations ) rather than physical phenomena as in the past .",
    "our study of the multifractal character of price fluctuations is based on a multifractal version @xcite of the traditional detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite .",
    "we also use a standard dynamical scaling analysis , inspired from surface growth phenomena , to show the multifractal behavior of the financial stocks , quantitatively extracted from the @xmath0order price  price correlation functions .",
    "our results go in parallel with earlier analyses of other groups @xcite which succeeded in showing multifractality in several stock markets and commodities . on the other hand",
    "we investigate the persistence of price fluctuations described by the persistence exponent @xmath11 .",
    "the bridge between these two analyses is provided by the second order hurst exponent @xmath17 associated with the correlation function of the stock price , which has been shown @xcite to be simply related to the persistence exponent through @xmath18 . in this study",
    "we verify that this simple relation is satisfied by both low and high frequency fluctuating financial stocks .",
    "the data we use for our stochastic study comprise the daily intel ( intc ) stock value between january 1990 and december 2002 and the composite nyse index ( i.e. , nya index ) between january 1966 and december 2002 .",
    "this corresponds to 3355 and 9312 data points , respectively .",
    "we also analyze sets of data recorded every minute for the johnson and johnson stock ( jj 2000 ) and every five minutes for the intel stock ( intc 2000 ) during the year of 2000 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to 98280 and 19656 data points , respectively .",
    "the daily recorded stocks have an obvious exponential increase of their prices over several years .",
    "therefore the exponential drift of the background can be subtracted from the stock price and we define a new stochastic variable @xmath19 , where the stochastic variable @xmath20 associated with the evolution of the background depends on two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we analyze the persistence probability of both @xmath14 and @xmath24 . changing the background subtraction within reasonable limits does not affect our statistical conclusions about persistence exponents and/or multifractality .",

    "we conclude with some speculative thoughts on the possible development of `` understanding '' _ in the sense of physics _ with respect to stock price fluctuations . in physics ,",
    "e.g. step fluctuations @xcite or kinetic surface roughening @xcite , one typically looks for minimal ( in the renormalization group sense ) dynamical ( in general , nonlinear ) stochastic continuum partial differential equations underlying the stochastic phenomena , e.g. , the edwards  wilkinson equation @xcite , the mullins  herring equation @xcite , the kardar  parisi ",
    "zhang equation @xcite , the villain  lai",

    ", hoping to derive the long  time coarse  grained asymptotic power law behavior of the system arising from some simple minimal underlying dynamics ( which is often based on symmetry and universality considerations ) .",
    "it is unclear whether such an approach based on continuum nonlinear stochastic equations is at all meaningful for the understanding of the dynamical evolution of complex economic phenomena such as stock price fluctuations .",
    "it may be possible to empirically construct dynamical equations which are _ sufficient _ to reproduce the exponents and the related statistical stochastic behavior described in this paper , but the _ necessary _ conditions for obtaining such equations are simply unknown ( in fact , we do not know if such equations exist , except in some `` trivial '' data fitting sense ) .",
    "it is therefore quite intriguing that stock price fluctuation data are amenable to stochastic analyses based on first  passage statistics and multifractality ( as carried out in this article ) with results not that dissimilar from physical processes such as step fluctuations or nonequilibrium growth .",
    "our work demonstrates that the persistence and the multifractal behaviors of stock prices ( both individual and composite ) are subtle ( including extended self - similar properties not identified in the literature before ) .",
    "it will be of interest to investigate if the empirical behavior we report in this paper can be derived from the various multifractal stochastic models @xcite for stock price fluctuations proposed in the literature .",
    "such investigations , clearly beyond the scope of the current work , would , however , be quite difficult since both persistence and extended self  similarity are notoriously difficult concepts to derive theoretically , even when the underlying non  markovian dynamics is known for a process . at this early stage of our understanding of econophysics ,",
    "the fact that the stock price fluctuations seem to follow the persistence and the multifractal properties of well  studied surface fluctuation phenomena is by itself intriguing and interesting .    to summarize , in this study we have analyzed the multifractality , extended self ",
    "similarity , and first  passage properties of several financial stocks . while the second order hurst exponent and the persistence exponent characterizing the power  law decay of the average persistence probability are not able to explain the long  term correlations in the investigated price time series , higher order correlation functions reveal much richer information about the complicated dynamics of such systems .",
    "we have shown that the persistence exponent @xmath11 is in agreement with @xmath170 and does not depend on the sampling time and measurement time .",
    "however , the survival probability has a nontrivial dependence on both @xmath4 and @xmath9 , presenting scaling with @xmath85 only when the ration @xmath86 is a constant .",
    "the numerical simulations of persistence , survival , and extended self  similarity features using discrete models of financial stocks remain on interesting open problem .",
