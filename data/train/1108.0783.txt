    "<S> one often thinks that perfect knowledge of the pdf as a function of time ( achieved by better experimental techniques or by data mining ) completely determines the underlying stochastic model . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that this is not the case by revisiting two exactly solvable models often invoked when explaining anomalous diffusion in labyrinthine structures of percolation type : the comb model introduced in  @xcite ( which mimics trapping in the dangling ends ) and the rwrw introduced in @xcite ( which mimics the tortuosity of the chemical path ) . </S>",

    "<S> passing from the sum to the integral we get for large @xmath3 @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> for the comb we get @xmath102 , same as above .    </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize our findings . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed the behavior of two popular models of geometrically induced subdiffusion : the random walk on a comb ( the model of the ctrw class ) and the random walk on the random walk s trajectory , belonging to the class of anti - persistent random walks . </S>",
    "<S> although both models lead to _ exactly the same _ pdfs at all times , they are crucially different with any other respect like fpts or correlation functions , which mirror the fact that the rwrw model is stationary and the ctrw model is not .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference in these behaviors leads us to a following conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> we say that a model is described by some equation if several relevant properties of the model can be obtained by solving this equation with corresponding initial and boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the fractional diffusion equation describes the comb model because not only the green s function ( pdf @xmath103 , the solution for free boundaries ) , but also the fpt distribution to the point @xmath42 follows from the corresponding equation , now with the boundary condition @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> this is definitely not the case for the rwrw model , for which we have to admit that the knowledge of the green s function ( and of the equation for it ) is not enough to obtain the fpt , and the model is not fully described by this equation . </S>",
    "<S> any conclusions about the nature of the process based on the pdf ( or moments ) alone or on the knowledge of the equation for such a pdf may thus stand on a quite shaky basis . </S>"
