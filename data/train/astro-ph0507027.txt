    "the x - ray  spectrum of many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) viewed directly towards the central source ( e.g. , seyfert  1 galaxies ) shows the continuum flux absorbed by numerous absorption lines .",
    "these lines are generally shifted slightly to shorter wavelengths indicating an outflowing wind .",
    "the flux from the central source is believed to drive the wind and to ionize it to the high charge states observed .",
    "the x - ray  band is uniquely compact as it comprises absorption lines from the full range of charge states from neutral atoms to h - like ions of all elements with @xmath3 6 , which helps to constrain the column density distribution over a wide range in ionization .",
    "the less ionized species absorb by means of inner - shell photoexcitation processes , which play an important role in the formation of discrete features in the spectrum .    in particular , the @xmath4  = 2 to 3 absorption lines ( @xmath4 being the principal quantum number of the active electron ) by low charge states of fe , neutral through fe@xmath5 , fall in the soft x - ray band .",
    "each ion can produce dozens of overlapping lines forming unresolved transition arrays ( utas ) .",
    "@xcite reported the first astrophysical identification of these features in the spectrum of the luminous quasar iras 13349 + 2438 obtained with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on board _ xmm - newton_. the broad absorption trough observed between 1617    was attributed to a blend of lines from fe@xmath6 to fe@xmath7 .",
    "the basic atomic data needed for spectral modeling of the lines was subsequently given in @xcite . since its initial discovery , copious detections of fe m - shell absorption",
    "have been claimed in other soft x - ray  sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to name a few recent ones ) . since most instruments are not able to resolve the various ionic utas , for simplicity , the observed , blended feature was dubbed in the literature as the fe - m uta .",
    "perhaps the most conspicuous astrophysical fe - m uta  is the one found in ngc  3783 . both _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  have observed ngc  3783  for very long spectroscopic exposures ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "several detailed global models have been constructed to explain the rich absorption spectrum of ngc  3783  @xcite .",
    "owing to its ionization sensitivity , the fe - m uta  could have played a major role in constraining these models .",
    "however , it was realized that the standard photoionization balance models fail tremendously in their prediction of the fe charge state distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , the current models could not produce the fe - m uta  spectral features consistently with those of other elements .",
    "recently , @xcite have used heavy rebinning of the _ chandra_spectrum of ngc  3783  to show that the overall position of the absorption trough in the fe - m uta  region appears to shift between low and high states of the ionizing continuum . in none of these works",
    "were the individual ionic features studied closely .    in this paper , we revisit the integrated 900  ks observation of ngc  3783  obtained with the hetgs  spectrometer on board _",
    "chandra_over several months .",
    "the same data were used before by @xcite , @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "presently , hetgs  is the only instrument that can actually resolve the individual ionic features inside the fe - m uta .",
    "conversely , the spectral resolution of the rgs  on board _ xmm - newton _  is just insufficient @xcite .",
    "curiously , the details of the uta  in the hetgs  spectrum have yet to be studied in detail , perhaps because of the difficulties mentioned above in using the fe - m uta  in global models .",
    "the sole goal of this work is to use the hetgs  spectrum to identify the individual ionic features and to measure their velocity with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc  3783 .",
    "the results obtained are quite surprising .",
    "the spectrum used in the present work is the exact same one reduced in @xcite and shown in their fig .",
    "it consists of five 170  ks hetgs  observations of ngc  3783  obtained during the period 2001 february  june as well as an early 56  ks observation from 2000 january , all of which are co - added .",
    "the + 1st and @xmath81st diffraction orders of both the meg and heg grating assemblies are included .",
    "the spectra are fluxed and corrected for galactic absorption .",
    "the wavelength scale is de - redshifted to the rest frame of ngc  3783  using z  = 0.00976 . for more details on the data reduction",
    "see @xcite . for the obvious reason of improving the statistics , we use here the total 900  ks data set .",
    "notwithstanding , we have verified that all of the prominent absorption features , which we discuss below , appear in each short exposure . moreover , to the extent that it is possible to determine with the low statistics of each short exposure , we have found that the positions of the narrow absorption features , which are of interest for this work , do not vary between observations .",
    "the heavy line blending in the soft x - ray  band where the outflow absorbs most significantly makes the direct measurement of individual line positions very difficult . for a consistent measurement ,",
    "therefore , one needs to use an ad - hoc spectral model , which includes simultaneously many charge states and all of the absorption lines pertaining to these ions in the soft x - ray  band .",
    "interested solely in the absorption features of the fe - m uta , we have constructed a simple model to explain the observed spectrum in the limited range of 14.917.5   .",
    "the model includes a power - law continuum , all of the fe - m uta  ions , fe@xmath9 , and the two o - k ions : o@xmath6 and o@xmath10 , which also have lines in this range .",
    "for the fe ions , the model includes all of the @xmath4  = 2 to 3 spectral lines for absorption from the ground level of each ion .",
    "the present fe - m model includes the full set of absorption lines from @xcite and not only the abbreviated set given in table  1 of that paper .",
    "for the o - k ions , the model includes all of the @xmath4  = 1 to @xmath11 resonance transitions with @xmath12 15000 as well as the photoelectric edges , from the ground level .",
    "the present model is similar in spirit to those used in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "for the continuum , a power law was fit to the relatively featureless region of the spectrum between 26   .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained are a photon index ( @xmath13 ) of 1.45 and a normalization at 1  kev of 0.00936 photons  s@xmath14  @xmath15  kev@xmath14 , which are in good agreement with previous fits for the low - state spectrum that dominates the present data set ( e.g. , fig .  8 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath16 due to an absorption line ( @xmath17 ) is obtained by :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the calculated cross section for photoexcitation ( in @xmath20 ) from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the ionic column density towards the source ( in @xmath15 ) for which we fit .",
    "the photoexcitation cross section is given by :    @xmath24    here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath27 is the speed of light , @xmath28 is the line oscillator strength , which we have calculated with the hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , @xmath29 is the normalized line profile described here by a voigt function that is the convolution of the ( gaussian ) doppler broadening due to temperature and to turbulence , which we fit for , and the ( lorentzian ) natural width of the line , which we have calculated with hullac . in observed agn  outflows ,",
    "turbulence broadening ( @xmath30  100  km  s@xmath14 ) totally dominates over temperature broadening . here",
    ", we use @xmath31  = 170  km  s@xmath14 . generally , in the natural widths of inner - shell excited lines , the autoionization decay rate ( @xmath32 10@xmath33  s@xmath14 ) dominates over the radiative rate .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations include both .",
    "hullac  is a multi - configuration , relativistic code most suitable for the inner - shell excitations of the complex atoms of interest in this study . for more details on the fe - m atomic calculations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the mean velocity for the ngc  3783  outflow was found by @xcite to be @xmath8590 @xmath34  150  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "consequently , our first attempt to fit the absorption in the hetgs  spectrum of ngc  3783  in the vicinity of the fe - m uta  was carried out using a uniform outflow velocity of 590  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "indeed , the fit for o@xmath6 ( he  @xmath35 and he  @xmath36 most prominent at 17.40 and 17.20   ) , o@xmath10 ( ly  @xmath37 and ly  @xmath38 at 16.01 and 15.18   ) , and fe@xmath9 ( at 15.01 and 15.26   ) is seen to be very good . on the other hand , the velocity of 590  km  s@xmath14  is clearly inappropriate for the prominent fe - m troughs . the fe - m features in the model are seen to be systematically shifted towards shorter wavelengths compared with their observed positions , most evidently at 16.50 , 16.33 , and 16.15   .",
    "the above result is already a strong indication that the fe - m absorber is moving at a much slower velocity than the more highly ionized gas , if it is moving at all . in table  1",
    "we list the identifiable discrete absorption features in the spectrum . for the mere objective of obtaining centroids in order to get a rough idea of the velocities",
    ", we have fitted each feature with a local continuum and a gaussian - shaped trough employing the same method used for the wavelength determination in @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the positions of the best observed fe - m ions are consistent with outflow velocities that are significantly lower than @xmath8  590  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the velocities in the table have to be treated with caution for two main reasons : ( i ) the absorption line profile in many cases is not a simple gaussian , but rather a complex distribution of narrow velocity components ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( ii ) the fe - m wavelengths have not been confirmed in the laboratory as discussed in detail in  5 .",
    "the spectral resolution of the hetgs  is high enough so that blending among fe - m ions is negligible as can be seen by comparing the 3rd and 4th columns in table  1 , which show that the individual - ion fe - m wavelengths and the full - model wavelengths agree to within a few m .",

    "the best fit was obtained by setting the fe - m velocity to zero as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the individual contributions of fe@xmath10 to fe@xmath48 to the total model are plotted in fig .",
    "3 . despite some blending",
    ", individual ions can be easily discerned in the spectrum . as can be seen ,",
    "centroids of the strongest absorption features in the model are determined almost exclusively by a single uta , which reinforces the validity of the direct velocity estimates in table  1 .",
    "the most conspicuous fe - m ions in the data are fe@xmath0 , fe@xmath1 , and fe@xmath2 .",
    "these ions in particular produce utas that are only very weakly blended with o lines or with other fe ions as demonstrated in fig .",

    "on the other hand , from our own inspection of the hst and fuse spectra of ngc  3783  we find a much slower absorber , the most prominent lines of which are ly@xmath49 and ly@xmath37 observed at an infall velocity of about @xmath41100  km  s@xmath14  ( see also fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as far as we know , this together with the present x - ray  results represents the first discovery of a high column density , almost stationary x - ray  component in any agn . in the intensive _ xmm - newton _  study of ngc  3783 ,",
    "the low charge states of oxygen ( neutral o and o@xmath50 ) have actually been detected at zero velocity as well ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 therein ) .",
    "however , both lines were stated to be blends and in any event neither feature was statistically significant .",
    "the present detection is much more unambiguous .",
    "the stationary or low - velocity component could possibly be an extended , slightly ionized part of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of ngc  3783 .",
    "it might be absorption created by the extended narrow line region of ngc  3783 .",
    "it could also be gas evaporating off of the molecular torus .",
    "a scenario in which radiation pressure is inefficient has been suggested for ngc  3783  by @xcite .",
    "the outflow velocity has obvious consequences on the mass outflow rate , which for ngc  3783  has been estimated to exceed a solar mass per year @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite have estimated the mass loss rate in this target due to the low ionization component alone to be as high as 75 solar masses per year and scaling linearly with the radial filling factor of the flow , which could be as low as 0.1 @xcite .",
    "all of these estimates for the mass loss rate are based on the high velocity of the outflow ( @xmath51590  km  s@xmath14 ) .",
    "if indeed , much of this gas is not moving as fast , it would reduce the estimated mass loss rate considerably .",
    "outflow velocities for individual fe - m ions have not been carried out for other agn  targets , mostly because the available observations generally do not resolve the individual ions in the spectrum , even when the blended fe - m uta  feature is very clear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the present result raises the suspicion that perhaps in other targets as well , this component of the absorber is not part of the agn  outflow . of course , this will need to be checked in the future for each target separately .",
    "if indeed this is the case , the ionization state diagnosed for these absorbers based on the position of the utais underestimated , as the high velocities assumed for these targets are being confused with higher charge states that are actually moving at lower velocities .    before concluding , we need to mention one disturbing caveat about the present measurement .",
    "the rest frame wavelengths of the resonant @xmath4  = 2 to 3 absorption lines , which we use to determine the fe - m outflow velocity , are taken from theoretical calculations @xcite . measuring these wavelengths in the laboratory is rather challenging and indeed , they have not yet been confirmed .",
    "as far as we know , fe - m uta  absorption has been observed in the laboratory once by @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral resolution of that measurement was not sufficiently high to pin down the positions of individual charge states .",
    "the errors on the present velocity estimates stem directly from the position uncertainties of the strongest lines in each uta . at 16   , an uncertainty in the rest frame wavelength of 30  mtranslates into an uncertainty of 560  km  s@xmath14  in the outflow velocity . indeed ,",
    "the scatter among wavelength calculations by different state - of - the - art atomic codes , which is one way to get a rough idea of their expected uncertainty , can reach and even slightly exceed 30  m .",
    "this , e.g. , is the case for the inner - shell k@xmath49 absorption lines of oxygen @xcite .",
    "however , even if there are such uncertainties associated with the fe - m rest frame wavelengths that we use , there is no particular reason for them to all be off in the same direction as to indicate a uniformly erroneous velocity .",
    "quite the contrary , with the parametric potential method used by hullac  @xcite , the atomic potential is calculated _ ab initio _ and separately for each ion , so that errors can be expected to be unconnected . indeed , a comparison between ebit laboratory measurements and hullac  wavelengths for the strongest line ( the same 2p - 3d transition that dominates the fe - m utas ) in each of the fe - l ions reveals that @xmath52  = 0 , @xmath85 , @xmath416 , @xmath812 , @xmath418 , @xmath4112 , @xmath4127 , and @xmath412 m , respectively , for fe@xmath9  fe@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "note that the laboratory wavelengths themselves are associated with errors of a few m .",
    "in short , the hullac  errors are generally much smaller than 30  m  and are certainly not uniform .",
    "having said that , until the fe - m utawavelengths are measured directly , this possibility can not be rigorously ruled out .",
    "if it turns out that after all , the apparent discrepancy between the outflow velocities of the fe - m low charge states and faster components of the outflow is due solely to the inaccurate fe - m atomic data we have used , then the hetgs  data and table  1 could serve as ( the best currently available ) wavelength calibration for the fe - m wavelengths .",
    "we have measured the velocity of individual fe - m ions in the x - rayoutflow of ngc  3783  for the first time .",
    "this measurement has never been carried out before for ngc  3783  nor for any other target .",
    "based on the theoretical rest frame wavelengths available to us , we find that the fe - m ions are not moving as fast as the more ionized fe species , such as fe@xmath9 , or as other highly charged species , which comprise the high - velocity outflow of ngc  3783 .",
    "in fact , the fe - m absorber may not be moving at all along our line of sight .",
    "we speculate that this stationary gas may pertain to the ism of ngc  3783 , to its narrow line region , or it may be gas evaporating off of the skin of the molecular torus . in order to examine whether this is a distinctive quality of ngc  3783  or",
    "if there is a fundamental problem with the atomic data , more high - quality spectra will need to be obtained for similar targets , which show deep , resolved fe - m utatroughs .",
