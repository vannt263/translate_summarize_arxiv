    "the young s double - slit interference experiment is one of the powerful ways to exhibit the nature of optical field , both classical and nonclassical coherence effects . in the recent years , an interesting subject is devoted to the study of two - photon double - slit interference in the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc).@xcite-@xcite since in this process a pair of converted beams created by a pump beam is in entanglement , the two - photon double - slit interference may show some peculiar phenomena such as the quantum sub - wavelength lithography and the ghost interference . for the former , both signal and idler beams are set together to pass through a double - slit,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite-@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and for the latter , the double - slit is placed on the path for only one beam.@xcite-@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , gigi the original idea of the quantum lithography comes from the reduction of de broglie wavelength for combining two massive particles . in optical system ,",
    "the sub - wavelength interference occurs for a biphoton state.yama in addition to the two - photon double - slit interference , the quantum lithography can be carried out in a mach - zehnder interferometer.@xcite-@xcite due to the fact that this effect can overcome the rayleigh diffraction limit , it may have prospective application in photo - lithography technology .    in most of the theoretical analyses ,",
    "the sub - wavelength interference is explained by a two - photon entangled state which can be acquired in the spdc with very low gain . nevertheless , it is the obstacle in practical application due to the lower power .",
    "therefore , the exploration of these quantum effects in macroscopic regime makes sense.@xcite,@xcite in this paper , we study one - photon and two - photon double - slit interferences in both spontaneous and stimulated parametric down - conversions .",
    "we focus on the case in which a double - slit is inserted on the paths for both signal and idler beams .",
    "we find that the sub - wavelength lithography can occur at very high gain of spdc with substantial visibility .",
    "the discussion covers both type i and type ii crystals which exhibit different behaviors in two - photon interference . in the stimulated process",

    "6c is similar to the one - photon interference case with the exception of that of the spontaneous contribution . in fig .",
    "6d , we define @xmath164 as the transverse position for the detector sensitive to the polarization of the signal beam , so that it is comparable to the one - photon case for the signal beam ( the right part in fig .",
    "furthermore , in fig .",
    "6d , the spontaneous process contributes a homogeneous background instead of a sub - wavelength fringe in fig .",
    "if two detectors in the joint - intensity measurement are polarization - insensitive , one observes a symmetric patterns which is the mirror - symmetry of fig . 6d .",
    "in summary , we formulate the first- and second - order correlation functions in the young s double - slit interference for both spontaneous and stimulated parametric down - conversions .",
    "the results reveal the relations between the first- and second - order correlations , and hence it can explain the complementarity of coherence and entanglement .",
    "we show that the nonclassical sub - wavelength two - photon interference can occur macroscopically in a general spontaneous parametric process . for a high gain of spdc ,",
    "in which the converted beams contain a huge number of photons , the sub - wavelength interference pattern is intensive with a substantial visibility .",
    "this makes the quantum lithography technology in practicability .",
    "moreover , we find an alternative way to observe the sub - wavelength interference for only type i crystal , in which a joint - intensity measurement is performed by a pair of one - photon detectors placed at the symmetric positions .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the quantum lithography in type i of spdc can be performed by two one - photon detectors instead of a two - photon detector which could be unavailable .",
    "since , this effect occurs only in a higher gain of spdc , it reflects macroscopically quantum nature for the entangled beams containing a huge number of photons .",
    "the two ways of observations compete for the visibility , so that at the low gain of spdc of type i the interference of the first observation reaches perfectness while the second observation disappears . in the stimulated process , the one - photon and two - photon interference patterns generated by a pair of stimulated down - converted beams are alike . for type i crystal , since two converted beams are polarization - indistinguishable",
    ", the coherent superposition of two converted beams causes a secondary interference which may fade the fringe when two beams are not well apart .",
    "however , this effect does not exist for type ii crystal because of the distinguishability in polarization for the two stimulated beams .",
