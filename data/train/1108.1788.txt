    "nonlinearities in dna dynamics were first emphasized by englander et al .",
    "@xcite who interpreted the formation of temporary open segments of base pairs as mobile defects coherently propagating along the molecule backbone . that seminal paper put forward the idea that the open configuration , allowing for hydrogen exchange with the solvent , involved torsional oscillations of the base pairs around the backbone axis .",
    "hence the thermally activated excitations of the double helix could be _ twisted _ solitons spread over a length of about ten base pairs .",
    "successive works @xcite suggested that anharmonicity in hydrogen bond stretching modes could lead to self - trapping effects @xcite and solitary - wave energy concentration thus providing the energy flow required in rna transcription @xcite .",
    "thus , soliton - like excitations were proposed to carry energy along the double helix in a way similar to the transport of biological energy occurring in @xmath1 helical protein molecules @xcite .",
    "later on , it was pointed out @xcite that dna biological functioning does not necessarily requires energy transport whereas nonlinearities should be rather considered in the framework of models able to overcome the continuum approximation thus accounting for the discreteness of the structure @xcite .    a remarkable amount of studies published over the last decades @xcite",
    "has shed some light on the dynamics of dna and the formation of fluctuational openings , the bubbles , which affect the thermal properties of the double helix including eventually its melting at high temperature . to tackle these issues , two classes of theoretical methods",
    "have been developed .",
    "the _ first _ is based on the poland - scheraga model @xcite treating denaturing dna essentially as a two state ising - like chain of base pairs with regions of variable size , denaturated loops , opening temporarily due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "second _ class assumes an hamiltonian approach generally based on the peyrard - bishop model @xcite in which the transverse stretchings between complementary base pairs are represented by a one dimensional , continuous variable bringing the advantage that also intermediate states in the dna dynamics can be described .",
    "the hamiltonian approach , describing the system at the level of the base pairs , seems particularly convenient in heterogeneous systems where the relative content of _ adenine - thymine_(at ) versus _ guanine - cytosine_(gc ) pairs @xcite and sequence length @xcite are key to determine thermodynamics and melting of the double helix .",
    "however , inside both theoretical approaches , different interpretations persist regarding the classification of the denaturation with some investigators finding a smooth crossover @xcite whereas others point to a sharp transition driven _ either _ by self - avoidance effects @xcite _ or _ by nonlinear stacking along the molecule backbone @xcite _ or _ by the finite range of the stacking itself @xcite .",
    "denaturation in synthetic _",
    "dna displays a single melting temperature while _ heterogeneous _ dna fragments denaturate in multisteps between about @xmath2 and @xmath3 depending on the sequence and salt concentration of the solvent @xcite .",
    "microscopically , experiments based on proton - deuterium exchange methods @xcite have shown that the base pair lifetimes are of order of milliseconds at @xmath4 with at - pairs lifetimes being three times shorter than those of gc - pairs .",
    "fluorescence correlation spectroscopy @xcite has further revealed that the breathing modes have a time scale in the @xmath5 microseconds range and bubbles of @xmath6 to @xmath7 base pairs open at @xmath8 under low salt conditions .",
    "base pair openings are thus highly localized at biological temperatures and remain such also in homopolymers .",
    "theoretical modeling for dna has then to incorporate nonlinear dynamics and large fluctuational effects which lead to base pair disruption and formation of bubbles whose size varies with temperature and environment _ ph _ values @xcite .",
    "while fully atomistic descriptions become computationally very heavy even for short fragments , mesoscopic models have proven capable to capture the essentials of the interactions in dna molecules .",
    "as fluctuations are expected to be strong in finite size sequences , i have recently proposed to apply the path integral formalism @xcite to a one dimensional model , the dauxois - peyrard - bishop ( dpb ) hamiltonian @xcite , which incorporates nonlinearity also in the stacking potential .",
    "the idea underlying the method is that the base pair elongations with respect to the ground state are time dependent fluctuating paths which add to the partition function and cooperatively shape the denaturation transition in finite fragments .    including in the computation a great number of molecule configurations , i have found that the denaturation is a smooth crossover both in homopolymers and heterogeneous systems .",
    "the latter also display the well known multistep melting features in the specific heat plots mirroring the fact that segments of the molecule open at different temperatures with at - rich regions driving the bubble formation at relatively lower temperatures .",
    "interestingly a recent study @xcite , based on the extended transfer matrix method @xcite , which focusses on the same heterogeneous sequences considered in ref.@xcite , finds similar results regarding the temperature location of the main specific heat peaks .",
    "however the hamiltonian model proposed so far suffers of a serious shortcoming as it does not account for the helicoidal structure which would have the immediate effect of bringing closer to each other non - consecutive bases along the molecule backbone @xcite . as a first step to describe helicity in the path integral method one may generalize the stacking hamiltonian by introducing the angle of rotation between a base pair and the previous one . in b - dna at room temperature , one turn of the helix hosts about ten base pairs @xcite .",
    "accordingly the equilibrium _ twist angle _ , @xmath9 , is expected to provide the energetically most favorable configuration , the stablest one against thermal disruption of the base pair bonds .",
    "this ansatz is a relevant benchmark for the computational method based on path integrals and should be viewed as a constraint for dna theories . in this work",
    "i develop the formalism for a generalized dpb hamiltonian in which the twist angle between neighboring bases appears as a free parameter .",

    "the longitudinal base pairs displacements along the molecule backbone are neglected as they are much smaller than the transverse stretchings @xmath11 , hence the model hamiltonian is essentially one - dimensional .",
    "the dpb hamiltonian incorporates nonlinearities _ both _ in the inter - base pair interactions modeled by a morse potential _ and _ in the coupling between neighboring bases along the two strands . as these are viewed as two parallel chains , the dpb model does not account for helicity .",

    "this amounts to say that small twist changes , i.e. @xmath187 , do not perturb the thermodynamics of the relaxed molecule but once @xmath176 differ significantly from @xmath136 , i.e. for @xmath188 , it is the underwound configuration to be naturally preferred : a moderate helix unwinding can sustain local denaturation bubbles which absorb the released twisting strain thus allowing for an overall molecule stability .",
    "certainly , a too large unwinding ( @xmath189 ) favors the complete strand separation and leads to melting .",
    "these findings are consistent with careful single molecule micromanipulation experiments @xcite and theoretical predictions based on the poland - scheraga model @xcite , mostly in regard to the asymmetric system dependence on the sign of @xmath171 . at this stage",
    "however our method , applied to the sequence in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , does not display any relevant physical effect by varying the superhelical density in the biologically interesting range , @xmath190 .",
    "the thermodynamics of a short fragment of heterogeneous dna has been studied by the path integral method focusing on the temperature range in which denaturation takes place .",
    "the model hamiltonian contains a solvent interaction term that enhances the base pair dissociation energy and stabilizes the hydrogen bonds between complementary strands . overcoming the limitations intrinsic to previous investigations which model the double helix through two parallel chains , i have introduced as a free parameter a twist angle between two adjacent base pair stacked along the molecule backbone . in b - dna the strands twist , around the molecule axis , about once every ten base pairs hence",
    ", the equilibrium twist angle is @xmath191 .",
    "assuming an _ adenine - thymine _ rich sequence of one hundred base pairs , i have studied whether the path integral model can capture an energetic advantage for such equilibrium geometry .",
    "the base pair displacements are considered as imaginary time dependent paths and the ensemble of _ good paths _ which contribute to the system partition function has been built consistently with some physical constraints , markedly the shape of the hydrogen bond potential and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "such path ensemble is a temperature dependent representation of the possible molecule configurations and it accounts for those fluctuational effects which are key to the dna dynamics , mainly in short fragments . in general , close to the denaturation , the path ensemble size grows as the system becomes more cooperative and more paths participate to the transition .",
    "thus , the ensemble size measures the overall system stability against thermal disruptions of the hydrogen bonds . by varying the twist angle",
    ", it is found that the stability is higher precisely for the torsion defined by @xmath136 and this conclusion does not depend on the specific sequence .",
    "the ansatz made in the introduction is then proved in the light of the path integral approach here developed .",
    "two major physical effects appear in our model and compete on the energy scale : the base pair displacements should become large enough to yield those fluctuational openings which are peculiar of the double helix dynamics and , at the same time , too large base pair fluctuations should be discouraged as they destabilize the system already at room temperature .",
    "the stacking potential has the capability to select the appropriate fluctuation amplitudes as a function of the twist .    in _",
    "untwisted or small twist models _ , @xmath192 , even large fluctuations are possible as the corresponding stacking energies , @xmath23 , are low on the energy scale set by the one coordinate potential @xmath15 .",
    "hence , such large fluctuations do contribute to partition function and thermal properties .",
    "it follows that molecules with small twist have scarce stability and begin to denaturate below room temperature .    on the other hand , in _ large twist models _ with @xmath193 , even small fluctuations have stacking energies which are higher than the hydrogen bonds dissociation energy hence , their contributions to the partition function become vanishingly small .",
    "accordingly large twist models have scarce flexibility and do not account for those fluctuational openings that are vital to the molecule . in this view @xmath136 emerges from the path integral computation as the energetically most convenient twist for the double strand configuration since it provides a right balance among the competing tendencies of this complex system .    for @xmath194 ,",
    "the unwound double helix displays an energetic advantage over the overwound one indicating that the opening of local denaturation bubbles is a natural strategy to stabilize the system absorbing torsional strain .",
    "i have also computed the fractions of open base pairs with reasonable opening thresholds and the specific heat for various twist angles : all the obtained results provide as much independent as consistent indications that the helicoidal geometry of b - dna has indeed a higher stability , albeit maintaining that flexibility associated with the nonlinear character of the intra- and inter - strand interactions .",
    "further investigations on these issues are due to come . in particular the twist should be treated as a rotational degree of freedom in a two dimensional path integral description thus incorporating also torsional fluctuation effects around the equilibrium geometry .",

    "<S> the imaginary time path integral formalism is applied to a nonlinear hamiltonian for a short fragment of heterogeneous dna with a stabilizing solvent interaction term . </S>",
    "<S> torsional effects are modeled by a twist angle between neighboring base pairs stacked along the molecule backbone . </S>",
    "<S> the base pair displacements are described by an ensemble of temperature dependent paths thus incorporating those fluctuational effects which shape the multisteps thermal denaturation . by summing over @xmath0 base pair paths , </S>",

    "<S> the partition function is computed as a function of the twist . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the equilibrium twist angle , peculiar of b - dna at room temperature , yields the stablest helicoidal geometry against thermal disruption of the base pair hydrogen bonds . </S>",
    "<S> this result is corroborated by the computation of thermodynamical properties such as fractions of open base pairs and specific heat . </S>"
