    "even if this is done , however , the dynamics of the mean field will remain unchanged , as it is determined by the @xmath187 terms only .",
    "the system can be linearized if the initial conditions are such that @xmath202 . then , until the time @xmath203 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are of order one , the dynamics of the mean fields can be described by the linearized system            as for the quantum fluctuations , we can recast the heisenberg equations and in a more compact form using the quadrature operators @xmath206 as introduced in the main text . in the limit @xmath34 , we find            in our description the first moments are zero for every time , i.e. @xmath212 . the second moments are given by the covariance matrix @xmath116 , as mentioned in the main text .",
    "if the initial state is gaussian , then the covariance matrix completely characterizes the fluctuations around the mean fields .    in the linear transient regime , @xmath213 , we find that @xmath214 , so that the dynamics of the fluctuations are the same as the mean field ones . furthermore ,",
    "if the initial state is such that @xmath215 , then the mean fields will remain zero @xmath216 and , thus the dynamics of the fluctuations is described by @xmath217 at all times .    in general",
    ", @xmath218 has a parametric time dependence , as it contains @xmath219 .",
    "therefore , it inherits from @xmath220 a periodicity of @xmath221 .",
    "then , by the floquet theorem , we can write @xmath222 with a constant @xmath223 and a periodic @xmath224 . for us , @xmath225 , therefore also @xmath226 . as a result",
    ", we have that the so called monodromy matrix is @xmath227 .",
    "our description of the dynamics becomes exact for every finite time @xmath94 in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "anyway , it s crucial to understand what the limits of applicability of our approach are for finite @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that , during the time evolution , fluctuations ( assumed to be @xmath178 at @xmath81 ) can become very large and even unbounded .",
    "when this happens , the expansion of the square root in the hamiltonian may become incorrect .",
    "in other words , for finite but large @xmath0 our description stays accurate until the n - th moments become of order @xmath228 . to ensure that this is not the case ,",
    "it is enough to require that all of the elements of the matrix @xmath113 are small compared to @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , our description of the dynamics is accurate until a time @xmath163 , defined as the first instant for which        in order to characterize and estimate @xmath163 , we need to consider the initial conditions for the mean fields , @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "in particular , if we take @xmath233 , the first part of the dynamics is included in the linear transient .",
    "this implies that , for @xmath234 , the time evolution of both the fluctuations and of the mean - fields is determined by the linearized matrix @xmath217 .    in the absence of driving and in the linear transient ,",
    "the dynamics would be characterized by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath217 .",
    "two of them are always purely imaginary , i.e. @xmath235 .",
    "the other two are @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is real if @xmath238 , it is equal to @xmath239 if @xmath24 and it is purely imaginary if @xmath93 .",
    "this means that if @xmath238 the fluctuations and the mean fields stay always of the same order , i.e",
    "@xmath240 and @xmath241 . at the transition point , @xmath24 , fluctuations and mean - fields grow linearly in time ; while in the super - radiant phase @xmath93 , the fluctuations and the mean fields can experience an exponential growth , with an _ instability rate _ given by @xmath242 .",
    "this is true until @xmath243 .",
    "after @xmath203 , the nonlinear terms can not be neglected anymore and one has to consider the full non - linear equations .",
    "thus , within the linear regime , we can define the characteristic time @xmath244 as the inverse of the instability rate , i.e.      we can estimate @xmath203 as the time for which one of the mean fields ( either @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) becomes of order one , @xmath246 since @xmath247 , we expect @xmath203 to be much larger than @xmath244",
    ". the crucial point , however , is wether or not all of the linear transient is contained within our limit of validity .",
    "indeed , for this description to be valid for times of the order of @xmath203 , we have to require that              this means that if the initial state is not so close to the vacuum ( the difference from zero of @xmath31 and @xmath32 being larger than @xmath251 ) , then @xmath252 . in this case , our description makes full sense even outside the linear transient , and can be used even when the mean - fields take macroscopic values . in this case , @xmath203 can indeed be estimated by and is finite .",
    "on the other hand , for finite @xmath0 , it is not possible to give a simple expression for @xmath163 , as it depends on the non - linear terms appearing in the time evolution , and the only way to check the validity of our approach is to check the condition .    instead , if both of the mean fields start too close to zero , specifically if @xmath253 , then our description ceases to be good before the mean fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 reach macroscopic values . in this case , in fact , @xmath163 is inside the linear transient , and , from , we can make the simple estimate      these estimates and reasoning can be adapted also to the case of a driven system , since they are simply a consequence of the fact that the dynamics of the mean fields and that of the fluctuations are the same in the linear transient .    for instance , for a periodically driven hamiltonian , we can use the largest positive floquet exponent of the linearized matrix @xmath217 in order to estimate @xmath244 ; and then use again the equations above to estimate @xmath203 and @xmath163 . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath217 is periodic in time , with period @xmath255 , then the monodromy matrix ( in the floquet description ) is given by @xmath256 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath257 are the floquet multipliers @xmath258 . from these",
    ", we can calculate the floquet exponents , that are the complex numbers @xmath259 .",
    "so we can define the instability rate @xmath74 as the maximum among zero and the real parts of the floquet exponents , i.e.      as a result , the arguments above can be applied in this case too , even if , in a strict sense , the stability of the dynamics can not be fully characterized by the instantaneous eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath217 .      as discussed in the main text",
    ", we compare the instantaneous state of the global ( atom+field ) system with the two - mode squeezed coherent state @xmath261 obtained by applying the unitary squeeze operator of ( real ) degree @xmath158 , @xmath262 to the two - mode coherent state obtained by taking the instantaneous mean fields @xmath64 and @xmath80 as amplitudes , @xmath263 the fidelity that we obtain by optimizing the parameter @xmath158 , is very close to unity , as reported in fig .",

    "<S> we discuss symmetry breaking and photon generation in the driven dicke model , where the frequency of the field , the energy of the atoms , _ and _ their mutual coupling are all allowed to vary in time . while the dynamical behavior of the single - atom case has been recently studied  @xcite , we are interested in the thermodynamic limit . by non - adiabatically driving the system , and thoroughly analysing its stability conditions , we highlight implications that non - adiabaticity has on the evolution of both the mean fields and the residual quantum fluctuations . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , we study the thermodynamic work produced by driving the system , and the associated degree of irreversibility , thus addressing the non - adiabatic production of photons from the electromagnetic vacuum , a phenomenon akin to the dynamical casimir effect  @xcite , and the associated generation of atom - field entanglement , from a genuinely non - equilibrium perspective .    for a negligible mutual atomic interaction and for an atomic system occupying a linear dimension much smaller than the electromagnetic wavelength </S>",
