    "tightness is a fundamental notion in @xmath1-dimensional contact topology .",
    "it is characterized by the thurston - bennequin inequality ( see  1.1 ) .",
    "roughly , for a seifert ( hyper)surface @xmath0 in a contact manifold , this inequality compares the contact structure along @xmath0 with the tangent bundle of @xmath0 by means of relative euler number .",
    "an overtwisted disk is a @xmath2-disk equipped with a certain germ of @xmath1-dimensional contact structure , for which the inequality fails .",
    "a contact manifold is said to be tight if it contains no embedded overtwisted disks .",
    "then the inequality automatically holds for any @xmath0 ( eliashberg@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3-jet space @xmath4 for a function @xmath5 is tight ( bennequin@xcite ) .",
    "thus all contact @xmath1-manifolds , which are modelled on @xmath4 , are locally tight .    giroux@xcite smoothly approximated a given compact surface in a contact @xmath1-manifold by a surface with certain transverse monotonicity , i.e. , a convex surface ( see  1.2 for the precise definition ) .",
    "thus , in @xmath1-dimensional case , we may easily consider that the above inequality is only for convex surfaces .",
    "contrastingly , in higher dimension , we show the following theorem .    in the case where @xmath6 , any open subset of the @xmath3-jet space @xmath7 , which is the model space for contact @xmath8-manifolds , contains a hypersurface @xmath0 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath0 violates the thurston - bennequin inequality , and 2 .",
    "no convex hypersurface smoothly approximates @xmath0 .",
    "this leads us to seriously restrict the inequality to convex hypersurfaces ( see @xcite for a sequel ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact oriented hypersurface embedded in a positive contact manifold @xmath9 @xmath10 which tangents to the contact structure @xmath11 at finite number of interior points .",

    "_ characteristic foliation_. the singularity of @xmath18 coincides with @xmath19 .",
    "the restriction @xmath20 defines a holonomy invariant transverse contact structure of @xmath21 and determines the orientation of @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "we define the index @xmath23 of each tangent point @xmath24 by regarding it as a singular point of @xmath18 .",
    "assume that the boundary of each connected component of @xmath0 is non - empty and @xmath18 is outwards transverse to @xmath25 .",
    "then the boundary @xmath26 is said to be _ contact - type_.    the unit @xmath2-disk @xmath27 equipped with the germ of contact structure @xmath28 is called an ( the ) overtwisted disk , where @xmath29 is the cylindrical coordinates of @xmath30 . slightly extending @xmath27 , we obtain a disk with contact - type boundary such that the singularity of the characteristic foliation is a single negative sink point .",
    "a contact @xmath1-manifold is said to be _ overtwisted _ or _ tight _ depending on whether it contains an embedded overtwisted disk ( with the same germ as above ) or not .",
    "let @xmath0 be _ any _ surface with contact - type boundary embedded in the @xmath3-jet space @xmath31 equipped with the canonical contact form .",
    "then bennequin@xcite proved the following inequality which immediately implies the tightness of @xmath4 :    @xmath32    eliashberg proved the same inequality for symplectically fillable contact @xmath1-manifolds ( @xcite ) , and finally for all tight contact @xmath1-manifolds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inequality can be written in terms of relative euler number .",
    "let @xmath33 be the above vector field on a hypersurface @xmath34 with contact - type boundary . then , since @xmath35 , we can regard @xmath33 as a section of @xmath36 which is canonical near the boundary @xmath25 .",
    "thus we can define the relative eular number of @xmath36 by @xmath37\\rangle = \\sum_{p\\in s_+(\\sigma)}\\mathrm{ind}\\,p-\\sum_{p\\in s_-(\\sigma)}\\mathrm{ind}\\,p.\\ ] ] then the thurston - bennequin inequality may be expressed as @xmath38\\rangle \\leq -\\chi(\\sigma).\\ ] ] there is also an absolute version of the thurston - bennequin inequality which is expressed as @xmath39\\rangle|\\leq -\\chi(\\sigma)$ ] , or equivalently @xmath40 for any closed hypersurface @xmath0 with @xmath41 .",
    "this holds if the euler class @xmath42 is a torsion , especially if @xmath43 .",
    "note that the inequality and its absolute version can be defined for any oriented plane field on @xmath44 ( see eliashberg - thurston@xcite ) .",
    "they are originally proved for codimension @xmath3 foliations on @xmath44 without reeb components by thurston ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a vector field @xmath33 on @xmath9 is said to be _ contact _ if the lie derivative @xmath45 vanishes on @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the space of contact vector fields on @xmath9 .",
    "we can see that the linear map @xmath47 is an isomorphism .",
    "the function @xmath48 is called the contact hamiltonian function of @xmath33 .",
    "a closed oriented hypersurface @xmath49 is said to be _ convex _ if there exists a contact vector field @xmath50 on a neighbourhood @xmath51 of @xmath52 with @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , i.e. , @xmath50 is positively transverse to @xmath0 ( giroux@xcite ) . by perturbing the contact hamiltonian function if necessary",
    ", we may assume that @xmath55 is a hypersurface transverse to @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath56 separates @xmath0 into the _ positive region _",
    "@xmath57 and the _ negative region _",
    "@xmath58 so that @xmath59 .",
    "each interior @xmath60 has the positive exact symplectic form @xmath61 .",
    "we can modify the function @xmath62 near @xmath56 to obtain a function @xmath63 such that @xmath64 are symplectic and @xmath65 is @xmath50-invariant .",
    "( this is the `` transverse monotonicity '' of @xmath0 . )",
    "note that the dividing set @xmath66 is then the convex ends of the exact symplectic manifolds @xmath60 .",
    "a _ convex hypersurface with contact - type boundary _ is a connected hypersurface @xmath0 which admits a transverse contact vector field @xmath33 such that , for the associated decomposition @xmath59 , @xmath60 are also convex exact symplectic manifolds , and the contact - type boundary @xmath67 is non - empty .",
    "( changing @xmath33 if necessary , we can assume moreover that the dividing set @xmath66 contains @xmath25 . )",
    "then the thurston - bennequin inequality can be expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath68    slightly extending the overtwisted disk @xmath27 , we obtain a convex disk @xmath0 which is the union @xmath69 of a disk @xmath70 and an annulus @xmath71 surrounding @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath0 violates the thurston - bennequin inequality ( @xmath72 ) , and is called a convex overtwisted disk .",
    "a possible higher dimensional overtwisted convex hypersurface @xmath0 would also satisfy @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "particularly @xmath75 would have to be disconnected ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath76 be an overtwisted contact @xmath1-manifold and @xmath77 the @xmath78-ball in @xmath79 @xmath80 . then there exist a closed hypersurface @xmath81 and a hypersurface @xmath0 with contact - type boundary in the product contact @xmath8-manifold @xmath82 such that @xmath81 and @xmath0 are not convex , @xmath83 , and @xmath0 violates the thurston - bennequin inequality , where @xmath84 denotes the natural projection to @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the cylindrical coordinates of @xmath85 , and consider the functions @xmath86 then we see that the contact structure on @xmath85 defined by the contact form @xmath87 is overtwisted .",
    "an overtwisted disk in @xmath76 has a neighbourhood which is contactomorphic to @xmath88 .",
    "thus , by using the formula @xmath89 we can replace @xmath90 in proposition with @xmath91 .",
    "then we take the hypersurface @xmath92 and its subset @xmath93 we orient @xmath81 so that the characteristic foliation @xmath94 is presented by the vector field @xmath95 indeed the following calculations shows that the vector field @xmath33 satisfies @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 we see that the vector field @xmath33 also satisfies @xmath104 with attention to @xmath105 .",
    "thus @xmath26 is contact - type .",
    "the singularity of @xmath106 is the union of @xmath107 and @xmath108 they are respectively a source point and a sink point ( see figure 1 ) .        precisely , figure 1 depicts ( the fourfold covering of ) the well - defined push - forward @xmath110 of @xmath33 under the natural projection @xmath111 from @xmath81 to the quarter - sphere @xmath112 the vector field @xmath110 defines the singular foliation @xmath113 .",
    "the singularity consists of the following five points ; two ( quarter-)elliptic points @xmath114 whose preimages under @xmath111 are the above singular points ; other two ( half-)elliptic points @xmath115 whose preimages are the periodic orbits @xmath116 of @xmath33 @xmath117 ; and a hyperbolic point @xmath118 , which is the self - intersection of the leaf corresponding to @xmath119 . slightly changing @xmath78 if necessary , we may assume that the preimage @xmath120 of the hyperbolic singular point of @xmath110 is a union of periodic orbits of @xmath33 .",
    "now we assume that @xmath81 is ( approximately ) convex in order to prove proposition by contradiction .",
    "the assumption implies @xmath121 where @xmath122 are the @xmath123 regions of the convex surface @xmath81 devided by the transverse intersection with the level set @xmath56 of the contact hamiltonian function described in  1.2",
    ". then we can see that the intersection @xmath124 contain a spherical component .",
    "however the eliashberg - floer - mcduff theorem implies that @xmath125(other components ) can not be realized as the boundary of a connected convex symplectic manifold ( see mcduff@xcite ) .",
