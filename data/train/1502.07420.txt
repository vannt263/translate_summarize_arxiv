    "in @xcite kapouleas and yang constructed a sequence of embedded minimal surfaces in the round @xmath0-sphere @xmath1",
    "converging to the clifford torus @xmath2 counted with multiplicity @xmath3 ; each surface approximates two parallel tori coaxial with a nearby clifford torus ( not included in the surface ) in between them and joined by many small catenoidal tunnels centered on a square lattice on the central clifford torus .",
    "accordingly they called their surfaces _ doublings _ of the clifford torus .",
    "kapouleas announced these in @xcite as the first examples of a general class of gluing constructions to double given minimal surfaces , subsequently discussed further in @xcite , and he has recently @xcite produced embedded doublings of the equatorial @xmath3-sphere in @xmath1 .",
    "the surfaces of kapouleas and yang are highly symmetric , admitting many _ horizontal _ symmetries , which preserve as sets the two sides of the doubled clifford torus and permute the lattice sites , as well as _",
    "vertical _ symmetries , each of which exchanges the two sides of the doubled torus but fixes as a set a catenoidal tunnel .",
    "in fact all these symmetries are enforced throughout the construction and exploited to simplify its execution .",
    "the present article carries out less vertically symmetric doublings of the torus , with the symmetry broken in two ways .",
    "first , we allow the catenoidal tunnels to be arranged on rectangular rather than strictly square lattices .",
    "any isometry of @xmath1 exchanging the two sides of the doubled clifford torus will fail to preserve such a lattice , unless it is square .",
    "second , we interpret _ doubling _ in a generalized sense , realizing also triplings , quadruplings , and in fact embedded minimal surfaces resembling an arbitrary finite number of tori coaxial with a nearby clifford torus and connected to one another by many small catenoidal tunnels .",
    "whenever at least three tori are incorporated , even if these tunnels are centered on square lattices , there will be many tunnels admitting no symmetries that preserve each as a set but exchange its ends , nor will the symmetry group act transitively on the collection of tori .",
    "these new constructions add to the list of known closed minimal embeddings in @xmath1 , so far comprising those found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "( actually in this last reference marques and neves apply min - max methods to prove the existence of infinitely many minimally embedded hypersurfaces in every closed manifold having positive ricci curvature and dimension between @xmath0 and @xmath4 . ) a variety of further examples , to be obtained by sweepouts , have been described by pitts and rubinstein @xcite , some of which appear consistent with surfaces obtained elsewhere ( among the above references ) by alternative techniques ( but none look like the surfaces we introduce here ) .",
    "the survey article @xcite by brendle contains an outline of several of the constructions just mentioned .",
    "the constructions at hand should be of interest not only as providing new examples of minimal surfaces in @xmath1 but also as a basis for further doublings with asymmetric sides . while this work confronts configurations with less vertical symmetry than is present in @xcite , kapouleas sphere doubling @xcite addresses a situation with less horizontal symmetry .",
    "we anticipate applications demanding a synthesis of the two refinements .",
    "a program toward doubling constructions of increasing generality , including potential applications , is described in @xcite .",
    "the present work naturally emulates , with a few departures , the approach of @xcite and draws extensively from the general gluing technology developed by kapouleas , much of which can be found summarized in @xcite and was itself inspired by techniques from @xcite .",
    "although the current article can be read without reference to @xcite or any other gluing constructions , for the rest of this introduction we will make use , without detailed explanation , of terminology standardized by kapouleas , so that the reader already acquainted with it may easily appreciate the principal differences between this construction and @xcite .",
    "we now outline our procedure in very rough terms . as basic data we take positive integers @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 specifies the number of copies of @xmath2 to be made , while @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath7 determine @xmath11 rectangular lattices , with ratio @xmath12 of fundamental edges , on which are centered in total @xmath13 catenoidal tunnels .",
    "corresponding to a choice of such data , an _ initial surface _ is built as follows .",
    "we start with @xmath8 tori coaxial with @xmath2 that have small constant mean curvature and so lie near @xmath2 . from each of the two outermost tori we excise @xmath14 discs centered on certain rectangular lattices , and from each of the remaining intermediate tori we excise @xmath15 discs .",
    "using local coordinates for @xmath1 adapted to the tori , we take standard catenoids , truncated at a pair of large , opposite circles of revolution , shrink them , and glue them to the tori , along boundary circles of the components so as to bridge adjacent tori , bending the ends as necessary so that the resulting connected surface is smooth .    for",
    "@xmath7 large in terms of the other data , the tori approach @xmath2 and the catenoidal tunnels , after rescaling , converge to a standard catenoid in euclidean space .",
    "thus for large @xmath7 each such initial surface is , in a certain sense , approximately minimal , and the construction is completed by perturbing the surface to exact minimality .",
    "two mechanisms of perturbation are applied in tandem .",
    "one sort of perturbation is realized by considering graphs of small functions over the initial surface .",
    "to select the right function is then to solve the quasilinear elliptic differential equation prescribing zero mean curvature for the corresponding graph .",
    "the equation can be studied by comparing the linearization of the operator governing the mean curvature of graphs to certain large-@xmath7 limit operators on the limit catenoids and limit torus . in the simplest scenario",
    "one could solve the linearized operator on the toral and catenoidal components separately , combine these solutions through an iterative procedure , and finally invoke an inverse function theorem to solve the original nonlinear equation .",
    "however , the presence of nontrivial kernel to the limit operators gives rise to _ approximate kernel _ that thwarts the approach just described .",
    "the space of admissible perturbing functions is constrained to respect the symmetries enjoyed by the initial surface , and so their imposition has the effect of reducing the dimension of the approximate kernel .",
    "each torus turns out to carry one - dimensional approximate kernel of its own , but in @xcite the two tori can be exchanged by reflections through certain great circles , and so together the tori contribute just one dimension to the approximate kernel in @xcite versus @xmath8 dimensions more generally .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite these reflections through circles render trivial the approximate kernel on the catenoidal tunnels . following the approach of @xcite in the absence of these symmetries",
    ", each tunnel would feature one - dimensional approximate kernel , but we bypass this kernel altogether by altering , as compared to @xcite , the initial data at the tunnel s waist for the rotationally invariant mode of the solution .",
    "to overcome the obstruction posed by the approximate kernel , @xcite introduces _ substitute kernel _ , spanned by a single function supported on the tori away from the circles where they attach to the tunnels . by adding multiples of this function to the source term of the linearized equation , the so modified source can be made orthogonal to the approximate kernel , enabling the success of the above scheme , but at the cost of solving the original equation only modulo substitute kernel . for the same purpose the current construction introduces @xmath8-dimensional substitute kernel , spanned by functions each of which",
    "is supported on a single torus away from the tunnels .",
    "( actually , in this construction we never explicitly identify the approximate kernel , nor do we invoke the @xmath16 metric employed in @xcite for its analysis , but our application of substitute kernel is morally identical . )",
    "a further difficulty concerns the vast disparity in scale between the waist radii of the catenoidal tunnels on the one hand and the much greater spacing between the tori on the other .",
    "the initial surface s second fundamental form grows toward the waists of the catenoids from a small value bounded uniformly in @xmath7 on the tori to a value diverging with @xmath7 , and the embeddedness of graphical perturbations is most precarious near the waists . for these reasons as well as to ensure convergence of the iteratively defined global solution , it is necessary to arrange for solutions on the tori to decay toward the catenoidal waists .",
    "all of the catenoids attaching to each of the two outermost tori  the only type of torus appearing in @xcite  are equivalent modulo the symmetries , and adjustment of the source term by the substitute kernel suffices to achieve such decay on these catenoids .",
    "( again , our actual approach deviates somewhat from this description , applicable to @xcite , but just superficially . )",
    "however , each of the intermediate tori , @xmath17 in number , attaches to catenoids of precisely two classes , and so the appropriate decay of solutions requires the introduction of another @xmath17 functions , linear combinations of which are added to the source term to arrange decay , a device originating in @xcite but unneeded in @xcite . in total",
    "we arrive at a @xmath18-dimensional _ extended substitute kernel _ , the sum of the substitute kernel and the span of these functions , modulo which subspace we can , for large @xmath7 , invert the linearized operator .    thus an infinite - dimensional problem is reduced to a finite - dimensional one .",
    "the resolution of this latter problem requires the second type of perturbation and is best understood in terms of a correspondence , which kapouleas @xcite calls the _ geometric principle _",
    ", between the initial geometry and the analytic obstructions that the extended substitute kernel represents .",
    "coarsely put , elements of the extended substitute kernel can be generated , as components of the initial surface s mean curvature , by certain motions of its building blocks  here catenoids and tori  relative to one another .",
    "so motivated , the other type of perturbation is realized by incorporating parameters , one for each dimension of extended substitute kernel , into the definition of the initial surface whose variation repositions the component tori and catenoids .",
    "thus for each choice of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , we define not one initial surface but a @xmath18-parameter family of them .",
    "more specifically , two parameters may be associated with each of the @xmath11 classes of catenoids , one for each pair of adjacent tori .",
    "one set @xmath19 of parameters controls the waist radii , while the other set @xmath20 adjusts the heights of the centers , that is their signed distance from @xmath2 .",
    "a degree of rigidity , in the form of _ matching conditions _ , is maintained to reposition the tori in response to the parameters , and the surface is smoothed using cutoff functions as needed .",
    "a single parameter @xmath21 works for @xcite , since there @xmath22 and the symmetry between the sides of @xmath2 forces @xmath23 .    in the course of the construction",
    "it is necessary to solve for the proper selection of parameters along with the perturbing function .",
    "the dependence on the parameters of the `` extended '' components of the extended substitute kernel can be directly estimated with accuracy adequate for our purposes .",
    "it turns out that these components are primarily generated by _",
    "dislocations _ resulting from antisymmetric variation in pairs of @xmath24 parameters associated to catenoids adjoining a common torus .",
    "the parameter dependence of the substitute kernel itself is more conveniently monitored indirectly , as in @xcite , via _",
    "forces_. the approximate kernel , and",
    "so the substitute kernel , on each torus , may be identified with approximate translations of the torus relative to @xmath2 .",
    "in fact @xmath1 admits an exact killing field which does not generate this variation of the torus but does approximate it locally .",
    "the force in the direction of this killing field through certain neighborhoods of a given torus then serves as an estimate of the projection of the mean curvature onto the approximate kernel and thereby as a proxy for the corresponding component of substitute kernel itself .",
    "the _ balancing _ equations and the analysis of the parameter dependence of the forces here are substantially more complicated than those of @xcite but no different in principle .    finally , estimates for the initial geometry , the linearized equation , the nonlinear terms , and the parameter dependence of the forces and dislocations are applied in conjunction with the schauder fixed - point theorem to prove that given @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 , for sufficiently large @xmath7 there exists a choice of parameters and a smooth , appropriately symmetric perturbing function such that the resulting surface is minimal and a good approximation to the corresponding initial surface , so in particular embedded .",
    "this article presents the results of my phd thesis , supervised by nicos kapouleas , who suggested the problems studied therein ; i am deeply grateful for his guidance .",
    "additional thanks are due to scott field , for discussions that further stimulated my interest in @xmath25 stacking , and to christina danton , for help preparing the figures .",
    "we realize @xmath1 as the unit sphere @xmath26 in @xmath27 and set @xmath28 the clifford torus whose equidistant axes are simply the coordinate unit circles @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we define the covering map @xmath31 by @xmath32 which maps ( i ) horizontal planes to constant - mean - curvature tori having axes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 in particular , ( ii ) vertical lines to quarter great circles orthogonal to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath2 , ( iii ) vertical planes of constant @xmath36 to great hemispheres with equator @xmath34 , ( iv ) vertical planes of constant @xmath37 to great hemispheres with equator @xmath33 , and ( v ) vertical planes of constant @xmath38 to half clifford tori through @xmath33 and @xmath34 , orthogonally intersecting @xmath2 along great circles . writing @xmath39 for the round metric on @xmath1 and @xmath40 for the flat metric on @xmath41 we find @xmath42 the initial surfaces will be built by applying @xmath43 to a stack of horizontal planes connected by staggered catenoidal columns .",
