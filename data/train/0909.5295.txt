    "recent studies have also revealed a significant anisotropy in the zeeman spin - splitting in one - dimensional ( 1d ) hole systems fabricated on the ( 311 ) heterostructures  @xcite , but it is not trivial to separate the competing influences of 1d confinement and 2d crystallographic anisotropy on the spin - splitting  @xcite .",
    "hole systems fabricated on higher - symmetry planes such as ( 100 ) are not subject to such complex crystallographic effects , and are therefore a much better candidate for studying the spin physics of 1d hole systems . to achieve high quality 1d hole systems we use semiconductor - insulator - semiconductor field - effect transistor ( sisfet ) devices , where a 2d hole system is ` induced ' using a voltage applied to a degenerately - doped semiconductor gate rather than through modulation doping  @xcite .",

    "in order to discuss the two key results in fig .  4 , namely the @xmath3-factor anisotropy and the decrease of @xmath2 as the wire is made narrower , it is first necessary to review some of the complexities of zeeman splitting in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .    for electrons in free space , an applied magnetic field causes the spins to align along @xmath67 , with a spin splitting @xmath68 , with @xmath69 . in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the projections of spin and orbital angular momenta @xmath70 and @xmath71 are no longer good quantum numbers .",
    "only the total angular momentum @xmath72 is conserved , and an applied magnetic field causes @xmath73 to align along @xmath67 .",
    "however if the electron is in a non - symmetric environment , such as a polar gaas crystal , a quantum well , or a quantum wire , the quantisation axis for @xmath73 does not automatically align with the applied @xmath67 and it is rarely possible to find eigenstates of both @xmath67 and @xmath73 .",
    "this complicates the theoretical analysis of spin splitting considerably , since the microscopic details of the host crystal and the confinement due to the quantum well / wire must all be taken into account .",
    "the upper - most valence band in bulk gaas consists of ` heavy - hole ' ( hh ) and ` light - hole ' ( lh ) branches that are degenerate at the valence band edge ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "confinement to a quantum well breaks this hh - lh degeneracy , such that only the lowest hh subband ( @xmath75 ) is occupied in a 2d hole system .",
    "however a residual hh - lh coupling at finite wavevector not only results in highly non - parabolic bands , but also plays a significant role in determining the electronic properties in lower - dimensional hole structures .    in the simplest approximation , the 2d confinement forces the quantisation axis for @xmath73 to point out of the 2d plane . to lowest order",
    "there is only a spin - splitting of the hh states if @xmath7 is applied perpendicular to the quantum well , since @xmath76 for in - plane magnetic fields  @xcite . in practise",
    "however , the cubic crystalline anisotropy terms  @xcite , as well as higher order terms in the in - plane wave - vector @xmath77 , can result in a finite in - plane zeeman splitting . for quantum wells on the ( 311 ) gaas surface",
    ", the cubic anisotropy terms result in a linear in @xmath78 spin splitting at @xmath79 . for ( 100 ) oriented quantum wells the zeroth - order contributions due to cubic crystalline anisotropies are absent  @xcite , but a substantial linear spin - splitting",
    "can still be achieved due to lh - hh mixing at @xmath80 , as discussed in  7.4 of ref .  @xcite . because the zeeman splitting on ( 100 ) surfaces arises from @xmath77 dependent lh - hh mixing , it is hard to define a @xmath3-factor for ( 100 ) 2d holes since @xmath2 must be averaged over all occupied states , and is strongly dependent on carrier density .",
    "one of the main advantages of quasi-1d systems compared to 2d systems is the ability to perform energy spectroscopy , and thereby measure the @xmath3-factor directly  @xcite .",
    "we can predict the expected spin splitting in our quantum wire using a quasi-1d model in which we take the 2d results in ref .",
    "@xcite and add on the effects of quantisation of the transverse wave - vector by the 1d confinement .",
    "we define the components of the wavevector @xmath81 with respect to the axis of the quasi-1d wire , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the in - plane wave - vector components parallel ( longitudinal ) and perpendicular ( transverse ) to the quantum wire . in the experiments on 1d holes ,",
    "the spin - splitting is measured at the 1d subband edges , where @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath83 is quantised by the lateral 1d confinement , we can express the @xmath3-factor of the @xmath50 1d subband as :    @xmath85,\\parallel } ( n ) = g^{*}_{[01\\overline{1}],\\parallel } ( n ) = 3\\gamma_{3}|\\kappa z_{1 } - 4\\gamma_{3}z_{2}|k_{n}^{2 } \\\\",
    "g^{*}_{[011],\\perp } ( n ) = g^{*}_{[01\\overline{1}],\\perp } ( n ) = 3\\gamma_{3}|\\kappa z_{1 } - 4\\gamma_{2}z_{2}|k_{n}^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath86 is the quantised transverse wavevector @xmath83 of the @xmath50 1d subband , and we have rotated the expressions in eqn 7.22 of ref .",
    "@xcite to align along the @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] axes .",
    "the subscripts on @xmath2 indicate the direction of the wire relative to the crystal and the field relative to the wire , respectively .",
    "the terms @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are luttinger parameters  @xcite and @xmath90 are lh - hh coupling terms ( see p. 147 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the first inference we can draw from eqns 3 and 4 is that the @xmath3-factor for both @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] quantum wires should exhibit the same anisotropy with respect to the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath91 is the same for both wires .",
    "this is evident in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "for both qw@xmath19 and qw@xmath20 , @xmath2 is the same for @xmath7 parallel to the wire ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) ) and very small for @xmath7 perpendicular to the wire ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this behaviour is quite different to quantum wires on ( 311 ) surfaces , where the anisotropy depends both on the orientation of the quantum wire with respect to the magnetic field and on the orientation of the field with respect to the crystal axes  @xcite .",
    "however the quasi-1d theory disagrees with experiment on whether @xmath92 or @xmath93 . using expressions for @xmath90 for square quantum wells  @xcite and gaas bandstructure parameters , eqns  3 and 4",
    "predict @xmath94 .",
    "the experimental data exhibits exactly the opposite trend , @xmath94 , as shown in fig .",
    "this is a surprising result , and we have repeated our experiment to confirm that this is indeed the case , obtaining identical results ( to within @xmath95 ) . we can only surmise that this discrepancy lies in the dependence of @xmath90 on the quantum - well confinement , as our 2d holes are confined in a triangular potential well at a single heterojunction , not in a square quantum well",
    ". unfortunately @xmath90 are not available for a self - consistent triangular quantum well .",
    "a second conclusion we can draw from eqns  3 and 4 is that in the quasi-1d limit , the @xmath3-factor of the wires should decrease with decreasing @xmath96 . in the 1d constriction @xmath86",
    "is given by the difference between the fermi energy in the 2d reservoirs @xmath97 and the bottom of of the 1d saddle - point potential  @xcite . at large subband index",
    "@xmath86 approaches @xmath98 , and @xmath2 should saturate to a constant value ( as seen in fig .",
    "4 ) . at small subband index",
    "the wire becomes narrower , the saddle - point rises up in energy , @xmath86 decreases and so does @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , the increase in 1d confinement increases the lh - hh separation @xmath99 , which reduces the magnitude of the higher order zeeman terms , and thereby reduces @xmath2 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath2 with decreasing subband index is consistent with the data shown in fig .  4 , but is different to almost all other studies of 1d systems , where a strong exchange enhancement of @xmath2 is observed at low subband index  @xcite .",
    "it is also different to previous studies of 1d holes in ( 311 ) quantum wells , where the zeeman splitting is believed to be due to a combination of crystal anisotropies at large @xmath29 and re - orientation of the quantisation axis for @xmath100 at small @xmath29 .      in the quasi-1d description ,",
    "the 1d confinement is a weak perturbation , so that @xmath101 , the quantisation axis for @xmath100 , remains perpendicular to the 2d system .",
    "the lowest order terms for the spin - splitting are zero , since @xmath102 , and @xmath2 is only finite due to the higher order @xmath77 terms .",
    "it is thus interesting to consider what happens in the 1d limit where the wire width becomes equal to the width of the 2d confinement . in this case",
    "@xmath101 is aligned with the wire axis and the lowest order spin - splitting is large and positive for @xmath7 applied along the wire , but is zero for @xmath7 perpendicular to the wire .",
    "this is consistent with the anisotropy measured in fig .  4 , where @xmath92 .",
    "if the 1d confinement is causing a re - orientation of @xmath101 , then one might expect that @xmath2 would increase as the system is made more 1d , as seen in previous experiments on ( 311 ) based hole wires  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is predicted theoretically that the sign of @xmath2 is opposite for wires in the @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] orientations for a square 2d confinement , so one would expect the measured @xmath3-factors for the two quantum wires to show different behaviour as we go from the quasi-1d to the 1d limit .",
    "thus the quasi-1d model can explain the observed dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath77 , but not the anisotropy of @xmath2 , whereas the 1d - limit model can explain the observed anisotropy of @xmath2 , but not the dependence on @xmath77 , since the latter depends on the quasi-1d model . to be able to resolve this conundrum",
    "it will be essential to perform more detailed calculations in the quasi-1d limit for realistic 2d confining potentials .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the zeeman spin - splitting in hole quantum wires fabricated in ( 100)-oriented algaas / gaas heterostructures , and find two new results : firstly , if the applied in - plane magnetic field @xmath7 is aligned along the wire , we see strong spin - splitting , and if it is perpendicular to the wire , then we observe negligible spin - splitting up to @xmath61  t. this behaviour is independent of the orientation of the wire on the heterostructure surface .",
    "although this latter finding is consistent with theoretical predictions , our finding that the spin - splitting is maximized for @xmath7 aligned along the wire is at odds with a quasi-1d theory , which predicts maximum splitting instead for @xmath7 perpendicular to the wire . at present",
    "the only solution to this disagreement may lie in the sensitivity of the theoretical calculations on the 2d confining potential  theoretical results have only been obtained for a square potential well so far , whereas the single heterojunction in our device leads to a more triangular confinement . secondly , we report a decreasing @xmath2 as the 1d confinement is increased , which is at odds with previous experiments of both 1d electron systems in gaas and ingaas  @xcite , and 1d hole systems in ( 311)-oriented gaas heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that despite the strong hole - hole interactions there is no exchange enhancement in our 1d wires , consistent with recent measurements of ( 100)-oriented 2d hole systems  @xcite .",
    "these results highlight the complex and interesting spin - physics associated with @xmath103 hole systems , and suggest that much more theoretical work is needed before we understand the physics of holes , even on ` simple ' ( 100 ) surfaces .",
