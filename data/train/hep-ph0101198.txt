    "in the framework of the qcd - improved parton model , the inclusive production of single hadrons is described by means of fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , @xmath7 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 corresponds to the probability for the parton @xmath8 produced at short distance @xmath9 to form a jet that includes the hadron @xmath10 carrying the fraction @xmath11 of the longitudinal momentum of @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet possible to calculate the ffs from first principles , in particular for hadrons with masses smaller than or comparable to the asymptotic scale parameter , @xmath12 .",
    "however , given their @xmath11 dependence at some energy scale @xmath13 , the evolution with @xmath13 may be computed perturbatively in qcd using the timelike altarelli - parisi equations @xcite .",
    "this allows us to test qcd quantitatively within one experiment observing single hadrons at different values of centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath14 ( in the case of @xmath0 annihilation ) or transverse momentum @xmath15 ( in the case of scattering ) .",
    "moreover , the factorization theorem guarantees that the @xmath7 functions are independent of the process in which they have been determined , and represent a universal property of @xmath10 .",
    "this enables us to make quantitative predictions for other types of experiments as well .",
    "after the pioneering leading - order ( lo ) analyses of pion , kaon , and charmed - meson ffs in the late 1970s @xcite , there had long been no progress on the theoretical side of this field . in the mid 1990s ,",
    "next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) ff sets for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 mesons were constructed through fits to data of @xmath0 annihilation , mostly generated with monte carlo event generators @xcite . in 1994/95 ,",
    "the author , in collaboration with binnewies and kramer , extracted @xmath20 and @xmath21 ffs through fits to slac - pep and partially preliminary cern - lep1 data and thus determined the strong - coupling constant to be @xmath22 ( 0.122 ) at nlo ( lo ) @xcite ( bkk ) . however , these analyses suffered from the lack of specific data on the fragmentation of tagged quarks and gluons to @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 hadrons .    during the last five years",
    ", the experiments at lep1 and slac slc have provided us with a wealth of high - precision information on how partons fragment into low - mass charged hadrons , so as to cure this problem .",
    "the data partly comes as light- , @xmath24- , and @xmath25-quark - enriched samples without @xcite or with identified final - state hadrons ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 ) @xcite or as gluon - tagged three - jet samples without hadron identification @xcite .",
    "motivated by this new situation , the author , together with kramer and ptter , recently updated , refined , and extended the bkk @xcite analysis by generating new lo and nlo sets of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 ffs @xcite .",
    "functions for given values of @xmath11 and @xmath26 may be downloaded from the url http://www.desy.de/~poetter/kkp.html or obtained upon request from the authors . ] by also including in our fits @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 data ( without flavour separation ) from pep @xcite , with cm energy @xmath2  gev",
    ", we obtained a handle on the scaling violations in the ffs , which enabled us to determine the strong - coupling constant .",
    "we found @xmath27 at lo and @xmath3 at nlo @xcite .",
    "these results are in perfect agreement with what the particle data group currently quotes as the world average , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "our strategy was to only include in our fits lep1 and slc data with both flavour separation and hadron identification @xcite , gluon - tagged three - jet samples with a fixed gluon - jet energy @xcite , and the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 data sets from the pre - lep1/slc era with the highest statistics and the finest binning in @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "other data served us for cross checks .",
    "in particular , we probed the scaling violations in the ffs through comparisons with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 data from desy doris and desy petra , with cm energies between 5.4 and 34  gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we tested the gluon ff , which enters the unpolarized cross section only at nlo , by comparing our predictions for the longitudinal cross section , where it already enters at lo , with available data @xcite .",
    "finally , we directly compared our gluon ff with the one recently measured by delphi in three - jet production with gluon identification as a function of @xmath11 at various energy scales @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "all these comparisons led to rather encouraging results .",
    "we also verified that our ffs satisfy reasonably well the momentum sum rules , which we did not impose as constraints on our fits .",
    "very recently , we extended our previous tests of scaling violations @xcite to higher energy scales by confronting new data on inclusive charged - hadron production in @xmath0 annihilation from lep2 @xcite , with @xmath14 ranging from 133  gev up to 189  gev , with nlo predictions based on our ffs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we quantitatively checked the universality of our ffs by making comparisons with essentially all available high - statistics data on inclusive charged - hadron production in colliding - beam experiments @xcite .",
    "this includes @xmath4 data from the ua1 and ua2 collaborations @xcite at cern s@xmath4s and from the cdf collaboration @xcite at the fermilab tevatron , @xmath5 data from the h1 and zeus collaborations @xcite at desy hera , and @xmath6 data from the opal collaboration @xcite at lep2 .    in 2000 , alternative sets of nlo ffs for @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xcite , and charged hadrons @xcite have become available .",
    "they are based on different collections of experimental data and on additional theoretical assumptions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , power laws were assumed to implement a hierarchy among the valence- and sea - quark ffs . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the renormalization and factorization scales were identified and adjusted according to the principle of minimal sensitivity @xcite . in order to estimate the present systematic uncertainties in the ffs , we compare nlo predictions for inclusive charged - hadron production consistently evaluated with the three new - generation ff sets @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we summarize the key results obtained in refs .  @xcite . in section  [ sec : two ] , we present some details of our global fits and assess the quality of the resulting ffs . in section  [ sec : three ] , we discuss the determination of @xmath29 from the scaling violations in the ffs and compare our nlo result with those of different determinations . in section  [ sec : four ] , we present comparisons of our nlo predictions for inclusive charged - hadron production with @xmath0 data from lep2 @xcite , @xmath4 data from s@xmath4s @xcite and the tevatron @xcite , @xmath5 data from hera @xcite , and @xmath6 data from lep2 @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : five ] .",
    "the nlo formalism for extracting ffs from measurements of the cross section @xmath30 of inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 annihilation was comprehensively described in ref .",
    "we work in the @xmath31 renormalization and factorization scheme and choose the renormalization scale @xmath13 and the factorization scale @xmath32 to be @xmath33 , except for gluon - tagged three - jet events , where we put @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the gluon jet energy in the cm frame . here , the dimensionless parameter @xmath36 is introduced to determine the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath29 from scale variations . as usual , we allow for variations between @xmath37 and 2 around the default value 1 . for the actual fitting procedure , we use @xmath11 bins in the interval @xmath38 and integrate the theoretical functions over the bin widths as is done in the experimental analyses .",
    "the restriction at small @xmath11 is introduced to exclude events in the region where mass effects and nonperturbative intrinsic - transverse - momentum effects are important and the underlying formalism is insufficient . on the other hand , our analysis should be rather insensitive to nonperturbative effects at @xmath11 values close to 1 , since the experimental errors are very large there .",
    "we parameterize the @xmath11 dependence of the ffs at the starting scale @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "we treat @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 as independent fit parameters .",
    "in addition , we take the asymptotic scale parameter @xmath44 , appropriate for five quark flavors , as a free parameter .",
    "thus , we have a total of 46 independent fit parameters .",
    "the quality of the fit is measured in terms of the @xmath45 value per degree of freedom , @xmath46 , for all selected data points . using a multidimensional minimization algorithm @xcite",
    ", we search this 46-dimensional parameter space for the point at which the deviation of the theoretical prediction from the data becomes minimal .",
    ".cm energies , types of data , and @xmath46 values obtained at lo and nlo for the various data samples .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "owing to the high - statistics experimental information on how partons fragment into low - mass charged hadrons provided by the lep1 and slc experiments , the determination of nlo ffs advanced to a level of precision which is comparable to the one familiar from similar analyses for pdfs . in this presentation , we reviewed recent lo and nlo analyses of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 ffs @xcite , which also yielded new values for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "although these ffs are genuinely nonperturbative objects , they possess two important properties that follow from perturbative considerations within the qcd - improved parton model and are amenable to experimental tests , namely scaling violations and universality .",
    "the scaling violations were tested @xcite by making comparisons with data of @xmath0 annihilation at cm energies below @xcite and above @xcite those pertaining to the data that entered the fits .",
    "the universality property was checked @xcite by performing a global study of high - energy data on hadroproduction in @xmath4 collisions @xcite and on photoproduction in @xmath47 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite collisions .",
    "as is well known , the gluon ff enters the prediction for the unpolarized cross section of inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 annihilation only at nlo , while at lo it only contributes indirectly via the @xmath26 evolution . in order to nevertheless have a handle on it",
    ", we included in our fits @xcite experimental data on gluon - tagged three - jet events from lep1 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we checked that our predictions for the longitudinal cross section , where it already enters at lo , agree well with available data @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the gluon ff is known to play a crucial rle for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 scattering at low values of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the comparisons performed here provide another nontrivial test of the gluon ff .    as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] , the theoretical uncertainty of the nlo predictions due to scale variations significantly decreases as @xmath15 increases . in order to perform more meaningful comparisons ,",
    "it would , therefore , be desirable if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 experiments extended their measurements out to larger values of @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , in order to render such comparisons more specific , it would be useful if these experiments provided us with separate data samples of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 hadrons .",
    "we also estimated the current systematic uncertainties in the ffs by comparing our nlo predictions for flavour - tagged inclusive charged - hadron production with those obtained from two other up - to - date ff sets @xcite .",
    "apart from a difference in the @xmath25-quark ffs at medium to large values of @xmath11 , which may be traced to the incompatibility of two underlying @xmath25-quark - specific data samples @xcite , all three ff sets @xcite mutually agree within the present experimental errors .",
