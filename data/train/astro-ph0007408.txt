    "although there is a strong correlation between the x - ray and optical luminosities of elliptical and s0 galaxies ( @xmath4 ; canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ; white & davis 1997 ; brown & bregman 1998 ) , a large dispersion exists in this relation .",
    "two galaxies with similar blue luminosities might have x - ray luminosities that differ by as much as a factor of 100 ( canizares et al .",

    "hot ( @xmath5 k ) gas is believed to be responsible for the bulk of the x - ray emission in high @xmath3 galaxies ( e.g. , forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) .",
    "another possible source of x - ray emission in early - type galaxies is from discrete stellar sources , primarily low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "estimates for the stellar @xmath3 value are uncertain and vary by a factor of ten among various studies ( forman et al .",
    "1985 ; canizares et al .  1987 ) .",
    "although stellar x - ray sources are not expected to contribute significantly to the 0.12.0 kev x - ray emission in gas - rich , x - ray bright galaxies , this claim can not be made with any certainty for x - ray faint ( low @xmath3 ) galaxies . in these galaxies",
    ", it is possible that stellar x - ray sources are the dominant x - ray emission mechanism . for this to occur",
    ", the gas lost from stellar mass loss must be removed from the galaxy by galactic winds , by ram pressure stripping from ambient intracluster or intragroup gas , or possibly both ( see , e.g. , ciotti et al .  1991 ; mathews & brighenti 1998 ) .",
    "evidence is mounting that lmxb emission is detectable in nearly all early - type galaxies .",
    "matsumoto et al .  ( 1997 ) found a hard ( @xmath6510 kev ) spectral component in 11 of 12 early - type galaxies observed with _",
    "asca _ , which scaled roughly with the optical luminosity of the galaxy ( note , however , that buote & fabian ( 1998 ) found no formal need for a hard component in the x - ray brightest galaxies of their _ asca _ sample ) .",
    "the luminosity of this hard component was small compared to the soft , gaseous component in the x - ray brightest galaxies , but increased in importance as @xmath3 decreased .",
    "however , the _ asca _ observations did not resolve this component into discrete sources because of the insufficient spatial resolution of the instrument .",
    "previous studies have found that the spectra of the x - ray faintest early - type galaxies are significantly different than the spectra of gas - rich x - ray bright early - type galaxies . _",
    "einstein _ data revealed that the x - ray faintest galaxies exhibited a strong very soft x - ray excess ( kim et al .",
    "subsequent _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ studies found that the spectra of these galaxies were best fit with a two component model consisting of the previously mentioned hard @xmath6510 kev component ( generally attributed to the integrated lmxb emission ) , and a very soft @xmath60.3 kev component , whose origin is uncertain ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ; pellegrini 1994 ; kim et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "one recently proposed solution to the very soft x - ray excess problem in x - ray faint galaxies is that it might result from the very same collection of lmxbs responsible for the hard emission ( irwin & sarazin 1998a , b ) .",
    "little is known about the very soft x - ray properties of lmxbs since nearly all galactic examples lie in directions of high galactic hydrogen column densities , so their soft x - ray emission is heavily absorbed . however , two nearby galactic lmxbs that lie in directions of low galactic hydrogen column density ( her x-1 and ms1603 + 2600 ) exhibit significant very soft x - ray emission ( vrtilek et al .  1994 ; hakala et al .",
    "but perhaps the strongest evidence comes from the bulge of m31 .",
    "m31 is close enough that most ( @xmath775% ) of its bulge x - ray emission was resolved into point sources with the _ rosat _ pspc and hri ( supper et al .",
    "1997 ; primini , forman , & jones 1993 ) , a majority of which are probably lmxbs . both individually and cumulatively , these point sources in the bulge of m31 have x - ray spectral properties very similar to the integrated emission from x - ray faint early - type galaxies in the _ rosat _ band ( irwin & sarazin 1998a , b ) . a joint _ rosat _ pspc + _ asca",

    "_ spectra allows us to place useful constraints on both the hard and soft emission , something that is not possible using each instrument separately .",

    "from the heasarc archive we have extracted long _ rosat _ pspc ( rp600262a02 ) and _ asca _ gis and sis ( 62014000 ) observations of ngc  4697 .",
    "the pspc data were filtered such that all data with a master veto rate below 170 counts s@xmath8 were excluded from the data , yielding an observation time of 36,856 seconds .",

    "the sis observation was taken in 2-ccd mode .",
    "spectra from a 4@xmath9 radius were extracted from the pspc , gis , and sis data .",
    "an extraction area of this size provided a good compromise between the minimum suggested extraction region for sis data and achieving a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio for the pspc data .",
    "for the pspc we have chosen background from a source - free annular region @xmath10 in extent corrected for vignetting .",
    "for the _ asca _ data , background was extracted from the deep blank sky data provided by the _",
    "guest guest observer facility .",
    "we used the same region filter to extract the background as we did the data , so that both background and data were affected by the detector response in the same manner .    for the pspc data , only energy channels between 0.22.0 kev",
    "were included in the fits , and for the _ asca _ data we used energy channels between 0.810 kev .",
    "the energy channels were regrouped so that each channel contained at least 25 counts so that the @xmath11-test is a valid indicator of goodness of fit .",
    "for all the joint fits , we linked the normalizations of the pspc and gis , but let the sis normalization vary to account for the fact that some of the emission that fell on interchip boundaries of the sis was lost .",
    "using xspec version 10.0 , we first attempted to fit a single component thermal model to the pspc and _ asca _ data separately .",
    "when the pspc spectrum was fit alone with a mekal model with a variable absorption component , a good fit was obtained ( @xmath12 degrees of freedom ) for @xmath13 kev and @xmath14 ( 90% confidence level ) , in good agreement with the analysis of the same data by davis & white ( 1996 ) . a significantly different result was found for this same model when just the _ asca _ spectra were analyzed ; the best - fit values were @xmath15 kev and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 degrees of freedom .",
    "clearly , significantly different conclusions would be drawn from the spectra if data from only one of the satellites were analyzed .",
    "this result illustrates the necessity of using both _",
    "pspc and _ asca _ data when analyzing the spectrum of x - ray faint early - type galaxies .",
    "when a one - component mekal model with a variable absorption component was fit to the joint pspc+_asca _ spectrum , a poor fit was obtained ( @xmath18 degrees of freedom ) with @xmath19 kev and @xmath20 . following the work of kim et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and irwin & bregman ( 1999a ) , we added a bremsstrahlung model in the fit .",
    "the mekal+bremsstrahlung model provided an excellent fit to the data ( @xmath21 degrees of freedom ) with the absorption value fixed at the galactic line - of - sight value of @xmath22 @xmath23 ( stark et al .",
    "the mekal model had parameter values of @xmath0 kev and @xmath24 ( all errors are 90% confidence levels for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "the best - fit bremsstrahlung temperature was @xmath1 kev . freeing",
    "the absorption parameter led to only a slight improvement in the fit , and the 90% confidence value on @xmath25 was consistent with the galactic value .",
    "we hesitate to attach a physical significance to this mekal+bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the spectra of individual galactic lmxbs are often fit by a disk - blackbody+blackbody ( dbb+bb ) spectrum ( see , e.g. , mitsuda et al .  1984 ) .",
    "the mekal+bremsstrahlung , however , provided a good fit to the x - ray faint early - type galaxy ngc  4382 ( kim et al .",
    "1996 ) and the bulge of m31 ( irwin & bregman 1999a ; trinchieri et al .",
    "1999 showed that a raymond - smith+bremsstrahlung model adequately fit the _ bepposax _ lecs spectrum of the bulge of m31 ) , whereas the dbb+bb model did not provide a good fit to the _ rosat _ pspc + _ asca _ spectrum of the bulge of m31 .",
    "since we are interested in describing the spectrum of the a collection of lmxbs in the context of an elliptical galaxy and not of lmxbs on an individual basis , we will continue to use a mekal+bremsstrahlung model as has been done in previous studies of x - ray emission from early - type systems .",

    "the optical source near source 11 has been identified as a bright globular cluster of ngc  4697 ( hanes 1977 ) .",

    "given the the hri positional uncertainty of @xmath65@xmath50 , the additional uncertainty due to the crowding of sources 7 and 8 ( which might contain additional components ) , and the optical position uncertainty of about @xmath51 , it is possible that source 7 or even 8 might be coincident with the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "thus , one of these sources might be due to an active nucleus in the galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , there is no evidence for an agn in ngc  4697 ; for example , the nucleus is not a radio source ( e.g. , the nvss survey , condon et al .",
    "the positive detection of only 12 sources does not allow us to determine if the sources follow the de vaucouleurs stellar distribution , especially considering that one if not more of the sources is associated with a globular cluster of ngc  4697 , and crowding in the center will underestimate the number of detected point sources in this region .",
    "what is not evident from figure  [ fig : hri_opt ] is the presence of very faint unresolved x - ray emission within @xmath2 ( the contours of figure  [ fig : hri_opt ] were chosen to highlight the position of the x - ray point sources ) .",

    "the surface brightness profile of the x - ray emission follows the optical surface brightness profile derived by jedrzejewski , davies , & illingworth ( 1987 ) out to 4@xmath9 , suggesting that the x - ray emission is distributed like the stars .",
    "however , it was found that a @xmath52-model profile with a shallow slope ( @xmath53 ) also fit the data adequately .",
    "the faint unresolved emission is actually the dominant source of emission in the hri image , comprising 79% of the total emission .",
    "the nature of this unresolved emission is discussed next .",
    "the 12 point sources detected within @xmath2 of ngc  4697 constitute 21to whether the remaining unresolved emission is the summed emission from lmxbs below the detection threshold of the hri or is a low temperature ism with @xmath54 kev .",
    "the absorbed flux of the hard component found from the spectral fitting of the pspc and _ asca _ data sets a lower limit on the contribution of lmxbs to the unresolved emission . in the _ rosat _ band , the hard component contributes 40% of the total ( unabsorbed ) flux .",
    "thus , even if lmxbs possess only a hard x - ray component , another @xmath55 of the total emission must result from lmxbs below the detection threshold of the hri .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "lmxbs might also possess a soft x - ray component .",
    "this component would have gone unnoticed in most galactic disk or bulge lmxbs , where the high galactic column densities associated with the galactic plane would completely absorb any very soft emission .",
    "although there does not appear to be a soft component towards galactic globular cluster lmxbs that lie in directions of low column densities , this might be the effect of the low metallicities in which the lmxbs formed ( see irwin & bregman 1999b ) .",
    "the bulge of m31 , however , provides the nearest opportunity to study a sample of lmxbs in an environment most similar to that found in early - type galaxies .",
    "supper et al .",
    "( 1997 ) analyzed the _",
    "rosat _ pspc image of m31 and found 22 point sources within the inner @xmath56 of the bulge with luminosities in the range @xmath57 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "individually , these point sources had x - ray colors that indicated the presence of a significant soft component .",
    "seven of the 22 sources had enough counts for supper et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to perform spectral fitting .",
    "the best - fit bremsstrahlung temperatures ranged from 0.451.5 kev , very similar to the result found for ngc  4697 for the same model .",
    "although such a simplistic model is not physically plausible , it did indicate that the spectrum of the lmxbs were significantly softer than the canonical temperature of 510 kev previously assumed for lmxbs .",
    "we can search for such a soft component in the point sources suspected to be lmxbs in ngc  4697 .",
    "of the 12 point sources detected by the hri , sources 1 , 6 , 10 , 11 , and 12 were also detected and resolved in the pspc ( sources 10 and 12 were marginally resolved from each other in the pspc ) . as mentioned above , source 6",
    "might be associated with background / foreground objects .",
    "the counts from the other four sources were summed in three energy bands , and two x - ray colors ( c21 and c32 ) were defined from the ratio of the three bands : @xmath58 and @xmath59 note that these colors are not corrected for absorption .",
    "sources 1 + 10 + 11 + 12 combined yielded 359.5 background - subtracted counts , or 14% of the total x - ray emission within @xmath2 in the pspc image .",
    "the colors for the sources were ( c21,c32 @xmath60 .",
    "as a comparison , the colors for all emission within @xmath2 were ( c21,c32 @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the colors of the four resolved sources are consistent with the colors for the integrated emission from the galaxy .",
    "this argues that the four lmxbs must also possess a soft component similar to that found in the global spectrum .",
    "otherwise , the integrated emission would have had significantly different colors than the point sources .",
    "conversely , the colors predicted from a 5.2 kev bremsstrahlung model with an absorbing column density of @xmath22 @xmath23 were ( c21,c32 @xmath62 .",
    "this differs from the colors of the four point sources by 7.0@xmath44 and 6.0@xmath44 for c21 and c32 , respectively . clearly ,",
    "if lmxbs were described by only a hard component , the colors of the four point sources would be significantly harder than what they are .",
    "we have calculated the colors of ngc  4697 in elliptical annuli ( with ellipticity of 0.42 and a position angle of 67@xmath63 to match the optical profile ; figure  [ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "c32 peaks inside of @xmath64 but flattens at larger radii , while c21 is constant throughout the galaxy .",
    "the peak in c32 may result from the presence of an agn in ngc  4697 .",
    "the constancy of c21 and c32 outside of @xmath64 implies a single emission mechanism ( or two emission mechanisms with the same spatial distribution ) , with colors around 0.6 for both colors , in rough agreement with the colors of the four point sources .",
    "the c32 color of the diffuse emission is somewhat lower than the c32 value of the four point sources , possibly indicating the presence of an ism component , although the discrepancy between the two colors is only at the 2@xmath44 level .",
    "the colors predicted from a 0.2 kev , 20% metallicity ism are ( c21,c32 @xmath65 , whereas the colors for a 0.3 kev , 20% metallicity ism are ( c21,c32 @xmath66 .",
    "thus , if any ism is present in ngc  4697 , its temperature must be below 0.3 kev and at a low metallicity , or else the c21 color of the lmxbs+ism would be higher than the lmxbs alone , which is not observed . in conclusion , we can not rule out the presence of some low temperature ism in ngc  4697 , although it is certain that an ism can not constitute a majority of the emission .",
    "4.5truein    irwin & bregman ( 1999b ) found that galactic and m31 globular cluster lmxb x - ray colors were correlated with the metallicity of the globular cluster , in the sense that higher metallicity globular clusters had lmxbs with softer x - ray colors .",
    "if this correlation extended to all lmxbs , it would predict that the x - ray colors of ngc  4697 should harden with increasing radius , since metallicity decreases with radius in elliptical galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity of ngc  4697 is rather low .",
    "within half an effective radius , the average metallicity is only 50% solar ( trager et al .",
    "the metallicity - color relation of irwin & bregman ( 1999b ) would predict a c32 color of about 1.5 within half an effective radius , and an increase with increasing radius .",
    "the colors of the four resolved sources as well as the unresolved emission are at odds with this metallicity - color relation .",
    "apparently , if such a metallicity - color relation truly exists for lmxbs , it only applies to lmxbs that reside in globular clusters .",
    "the x - ray source in ngc  4697 associated with a globular cluster ( source 11 ) has a c32 color of @xmath67 , which would be consistent with the metallicity - color relation if the globular cluster has a high metallicity .",
    "we also investigated the possibility that lmxbs below the detection threshold of the hri could account for the unresolved emission given a reasonable lmxb luminosity distribution function for ngc  4697 .",
    "we assumed a luminosity distribution function @xmath68 , which is consistent within the errors with the luminosity distribution function of point sources in m31 with luminosities greater than @xmath69 ergs s@xmath8 ( primini et al .",
    "the function was normalized to yield the observed x - ray luminosity of ngc  4697 when integrated over all lmxb luminosities .",
    "this model predicted 11 sources with luminosities over @xmath70 ergs s@xmath8 , which contributed 18% to the total x - ray emission from lmxbs .",
    "this agrees well with what was observed with the hri ; neglecting the point source associated with an unidentified optical counterpart , the remaining 11 detected sources comprised 19% of the total emission .",
    "thus , if the luminosity distribution function of lmxbs of ngc  4697 is similar to that of the brighter lmxbs in m31 , the integrated emission from lmxbs below the detection threshold of the hri can account for most of the unresolved emission .",
    "4.5truein    interestingly , the detection limit of the hri observation of @xmath70 ergs s@xmath8 lies above the eddington luminosity limit for a @xmath71 neutron star .",
    "lmxbs of similar luminosities as the ones found here exist in our own galaxy .",
    "a compilation by christian & swank ( 1997 ) found eight galactic lmxbs with luminosities greater than @xmath70 ergs s@xmath8 ( we have converted their 0.74.5 kev luminosities to 0.25 - 10 kev luminosities using the spectral model of   [ sec : spectral ] ) .",
    "these high luminosities imply either that the compact object within the binary is a black hole ( with @xmath72 for the most luminous binaries ) or that the luminosities truly exceed the eddington limit for a neutron star .",
    "the former would imply that active binaries with massive black holes are fairly common in galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the bulge of m31 lacks the very high luminosity lmxbs that ngc  4697 has ; the brightest lmxb in m31 was only @xmath73 ergs s@xmath8 ( supper et al .",
    "however , this is likely the result of small number statistics .",
    "simulations of the bulge of m31 using a luminosity distribution function of the form @xmath68 indicated that only 13 sources with luminosities exceeding @xmath74 ergs s@xmath8 should be found in m31 . in five separate simulations of m31 , the peak luminosity for an lmxb did not exceed @xmath70 ergs s@xmath8 , in agreement with observation .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of at least some interstellar medium in ngc  4697 and x - ray faint early - type galaxies in general . using the x - ray temperature  optical velocity dispersion relation of davis & white ( 1996 ) , any ism present in ngc  4697",
    "would be expected to have a temperature around 0.3 kev .",
    "this would be very difficult to distinguish from the soft component from lmxbs on a spectroscopic basis alone .",
    "what is needed to separate the ism component from the lmxb emission is the high spatial resolution that can be afforded by _",
    "chandra_. below , we present a simulation of what we expect the emission from ngc  4697 to look like in the event that the emission is composed solely of lmxbs .",
    "we have an approved cycle 1 40,000 s _ chandra _ observation of ngc  4697 ; here we show that this observation should resolve the hard and soft x - ray emission into individual sources , assuming that the emission is from lmxbs .",
    "conversely , the observation should cleanly separate a truly diffuse emission from that of lmxbs . since the main goal is to resolve the issue of the very soft component , the soft x - ray sensitive backside - illuminated ( bi ) s3 chip of the acis - s array will be used for the observation .",
    "we have used the marx ( model of _ axaf _ response to x - rays ; wise , huenemoerder , & davis 1997 ) simulator to generate a synthetic image of ngc  4697 .",
    "the marx simulator takes as input the desired spectral model and spatial distribution model of an x - ray source and creates an image of the source as it would appear once having passed through the optics of _ chandra_. the spectral and spatial distribution models described below were fed into marx using the acis - s bi response to produce an image of ngc  4697 for a 40,000 s observation .    for the spectra of the lmxbs , we assume a model that best fit the joint _ rosat _ pspc + _ asca _ spectrum of ngc  4697 discussed in   [ sec : spectral ] . for the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission , we assume that the lmxbs have the same spatial distribution as the stellar light .",
    "we take the optical distribution to be a de vaucouleurs profile ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) with a mean half - light radius of @xmath75 , an effective semimajor axis of @xmath76 , an effective semiminor axis of @xmath77 , resulting in an ellipticity of 0.42 , and elongated at a position angle of 67@xmath63 .",
    "( jedrzejewski et al .  1987 ; faber et al .  1989 ; peletier et al .  1990 ) . as before",
    ", we assume a luminosity distribution function for the lmxbs of the form @xmath68 .",
    "the luminosity distribution function contained point sources with 0.2510.0 kev luminosities between @xmath78 and @xmath79 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "a model galaxy was created by drawing lmxbs at random from the luminosity distribution function and the spatial distribution until the sum of the luminosities of the lmxbs totaled the x - ray luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we did not use the observed positions and fluxes of the sources in table 1 in the model ; the sources are randomly drawn from the optical surface brightness distribution and x - ray luminosity distribution .",
    "we did not include background in this simulation .",
    "the background in the _ chandra _ acis s-3 chip is highly variable ( markevitch 1999 ) , and its level during the observation will affect the ability to detect the weakest sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : chandra ] shows the simulated image of ngc  4697 .",
    "the image shows the inner @xmath2 by @xmath2 of the galaxy .",
    "the excellent spatial resolution of _ chandra _ is evident .",
    "the dynamic range of the source brightness in this image is not clear from this greyscale representation , since all of the strong sources are nearly the same size ( set by the resolution ) and black .",
    "however , the sources cover a range of @xmath625 in flux . for our simulation , we assumed that 16 source counts would be needed to give a @xmath80 detection considering the variable background of the acis s-3 chip .",
    "this assumption predicts that @xmath6100 sources would be detected at @xmath81 with a detection threshold of @xmath82 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "these 100 sources comprise 50% of the total luminosity of the galaxy . in the 0.250.8 kev band ,",
    "@xmath650 sources were detected at @xmath81 .",
    "we have also simulated a _",
    "image where the lmxbs have only a hard ( 5.2 kev ) bremsstrahlung component that comprises 59% of the 0.2510 kev emission ( this was the relative contribution of the hard component to the total emission found in   [ sec : spectral ] ) . in this case , only about 12 lmxbs were detected in the 0.250.8 kev band .",
    "if lmxbs do possess a soft component , it will be immediately obvious from the 0.250.8 kev _ chandra _ image of ngc  4697 .",
    "x - ray spectra of some of the brighter sources , x - ray colors of fainter sources , the cumulative x - ray spectra of individual sources and of any remaining unresolved diffuse emission can be determined , and should resolve the question of the origin of the hard and soft x - ray components in x - ray faint ellipticals .",
    "a number of fundamental questions regarding the x - ray emission from early - type and sa galaxies will be answered with _",
    "chandra_. with the expected number of detectable lmxbs , accurate luminosity distribution functions can be determined .",
    "this is something that has been accomplished for only a handful of nearby galaxies , none of which are normal early - type galaxies .",
    "this will provide important clues to the stellar evolution of binary stars in galaxies .",
    "there is evidence that there may not be a universal stellar x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio .",
    "a range of @xmath83 values has been suggested by comparison of the x - ray emission of the bulge of m31 to that of cen a ( turner et al .",
    "1997 ) , and also to several very x - ray faint early - type galaxies in the irwin & sarazin ( 1998b ) survey .",
    "if nearly all the x - ray emission in ngc  4697 turns out to be stellar in nature , it would be difficult to explain why the early - type galaxy ngc  5102 , for example , has a 0.5 - 2.0 kev @xmath3 value that is 19 times lower than that of ngc  4697 ( irwin & sarazin 1998b ) , if @xmath83 is constant from galaxy to galaxy . without knowledge of the luminosity distribution function , it can not be determined if this difference is a result of a different slope in the distribution function among galaxies , or if the slopes are the same but the normalizations of the function ( relative to the optical luminosity of the galaxy ) are different .",
    "the separation of the stellar and gaseous components is necessary to resolve this issue .    since lmxb emission is expected to be present in all early - type galaxies , the magnitude of this component needs to be known accurately in order to subtract the lmxb contribution from the total x - ray emission in gas - rich early - type galaxies .",
    "this will make estimates of the mass of elliptical galaxies based on the assumption that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium more accurate .",
    "this is particularly important in the event that lmxbs possess a strong soft component .",
    "although , the contribution of lmxbs to the total x - ray emission from very x - ray bright virgo elliptical galaxies such as ngc  4472 and ngc  4636 will be small ( less than 10% in the 0.12.4 kev band ) , lmxbs might contribute a significant percentage of the x - ray emission in galaxies of intermediate x - ray brightness , and will have to be dealt with accordingly if the true amount of x - ray gas is to be determined .",
    "we have analyzed deep _ asca _ , _ rosat _ pspc , and _ rosat _ hri images of the x - ray faint early - type galaxy ngc  4697 .",
    "much like other x - ray faint early - type systems , the spectrum of ngc  4697 is characterized by hard ( 5 kev ) plus very soft ( 0.3 kev ) emission . whereas the nature of the hard emission is generally regarded as the integrated emission from lmxbs , we have provided additional evidence that much of the soft emission also emanates from lmxbs .",
    "four of the 12 hri point sources were resolved by the pspc and were found to have soft x - ray colors that were very similar to those of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "these colors were significantly softer than the colors predicted if only the hard component was attributed to lmxbs .",
    "the 12 point sources detected by the hri comprised 21% of the total x - ray emission within @xmath2 of ngc  4697 . given a luminosity distribution function consistent with that for",
    "the brighter point sources in m31 , the remaining unresolved emission could emanate solely from lmxbs below the detection threshold of the observation .",
    "however , the presence of a low temperature ism could not be completely ruled out .",
    "higher spatial resolution data afforded by _",
    "chandra _ should successfully resolve much of the lmxb emission , as we have shown in our simulations .",
    "the determination of the origin of the soft component will have important implications concerning our understanding of the fate of gas lost from stars in galaxies as well as the x - ray emission mechanism of lmxbs .",
