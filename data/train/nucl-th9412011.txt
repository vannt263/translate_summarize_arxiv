    "the purpose of this paper is to study the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 stands for @xmath16(1232 ) , @xmath17 stands for either the @xmath18 or the @xmath19 ) reactions for kaon productions in heavy ion collisions .",
    "one of the main goals of intermediate energy heavy ion physics is to determine the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter .",
    "theoretical studies show that the kaons produced in heavy ion collisions are sensitive to the eos @xcite@xcite . to calculate the kaon production in heavy ion collisions",
    "one needs two ingredients @xcite@xcite :    \\1 .",
    "a transport theory to describe the evolution of the heavy ion colliding systems .",
    "the elementary cross sections of kaon production in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 collisions ( here @xmath22 stands for either a nucleon @xmath23 or a @xmath24 ) .    therefore , in order to obtain a definite conclusion about the eos one needs the reliable elementary cross sections for the kaon production as well as the dynamical transport models .",
    "one usually uses transport models such as buu / vuu @xcite and qmd @xcite to simulate the dynamical evolution of projectile and target systems . in these models collision terms and the nuclear mean field are included . by including the nuclear mean field one hopes to determine the eos . in the collision terms ,",
    "the following reactions are included as main processes : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 then , kaons can be produced mainly through the following reactions : @xmath31 and @xmath32    the lorentz - invariant differential multiplicity for kaons for a given impact parameter @xmath33 in heavy ion collisions is connected with the elementary cross section by @xmath34 \\frac{d\\omega } { 4\\pi } \\nonumber   \\\\ &    & + \\sum _ { \\pi b_{coll } }   e '' \\frac{d^3\\sigma   _ { \\pi b\\rightarrow y k } ( \\sqrt { s_{\\pi b}})}{d^3 p''}/ \\sigma _ { \\pi b}^{tot}(\\sqrt { s_{\\pi b } } ) , \\label{basic1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the primed and the double - primed quantities are in the center - of - momentum ( c.m . )",
    "frames of the two colliding baryons ( @xmath20 ) and pion - baryon ( @xmath21 ) , respectively .",
    "the unprimed quantities are in the c.m .",
    "frame of the two nuclei .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the total cross sections for two baryons @xmath37 and the pion - nucleon system ( @xmath38 ) as functions of c.m .",
    "energy @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath41 $ ] stands for the pauli blocking correction for the final nucleon @xmath23 in the @xmath42 reaction due to the surrounding nuclear medium .",
    "the lorentz - invariant differential kaon - production cross section in heavy ion collisions is then given by : @xmath43 from eq.([basic1 ] ) we see that the elementary cross sections are directly related to the kaon yields in heavy ion collisions .",
    "thus , it is important to have good elementary kaon - production cross sections",
    ".    however , most elementary cross sections needed in studying heavy ion collisions are not well known experimentally .",
    "therefore one has to use the available experimental data as far as possible . in the case",
    "when no experimental data are available one has to rely on symmetry considerations and theoretical models to extrapolate the available experimental data .    the elementary kaon - production cross section in @xmath20 collisions used in eq.([basic1 ] ) are usually taken from randrup and ko@xcite . in their works ,",
    "the @xmath44and @xmath45 total cross sections are obtained from @xmath46 cross section by symmetry consideration in isospin space , and the @xmath16 is treated as spin-@xmath47 ( not @xmath48 ) and isospin-@xmath48 particle . moreover , the coupling constants relevant to the @xmath16 are assumed to be the same as for the nucleon @xmath23 .    the elementary @xmath49-production cross section in @xmath21 collisions needed in eq.([basic1 ] ) are usually taken from cugnon and lombard s parametrization@xcite . in this parametrization",
    "the isospin averaged cross sections are obtained from only three available experimental data assuming proton and neutron @xmath50 symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is , in principle , valid for the light nuclei , and not appropriate for collisions between heavy nuclei with a large neutron excess , i.e. @xmath51 . furthermore the parametrization for the reaction @xmath1 is not given , hence the contribution of this channel to kaon production in the heavy ion collision is unclear .    by using the elementary cross section of randrup and ko",
    ", one finds that @xmath52 gives the main contribution to the total kaon yield in heavy ion collisions@xcite .",
    "however , the elementary cross section for this channel is experimentally unknown .",
    "thus a more sophisticated study of this channel is still necessary . in order to determine the cross section for the reaction @xmath52",
    ", one needs at first to study the reaction @xmath53 according to randrup and ko s model@xcite@xcite .    since in heavy ion collisions many pions are produced , and the threshold of @xmath54 is lower than in @xmath42 , the reaction @xmath55 seems to be important as a secondary process besides the @xmath42 channel for kaon production .",
    "according to a study of the giessen group , the @xmath56 process is dominant for kaon production in proton - nucleus reactions@xcite .",
    "recently , in the simulation codes of buu and qmd the isospin dependence has been considered .",
    "one distinguishes the members of the nucleon isospin - doublet(@xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , of the pion isospin - triplet(@xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) and of the delta isospin - quartet ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65)@xcite@xcite .",
    "this enables us to calculate the kaon production in an isospin dependent way , hence one needs information on all the possible isospin channels for kaon production .",
    "this means that the isospin - averaged elementary cross sections of @xmath66 and @xmath67 can not be used for this purpose . for an isospin - dependent description of kaon production",
    ", one needs all the isospin channels .",
    "however , the cross sections for some isospin channels are not available in experiment",
    ". therefore one needs a theoretical model to evaluate all the unknown isospin channels .    on the other hand , in order to study medium effects for kaon production , a dynamical model for the elementary cross sections is needed , since one can not simply obtain the in - medium cross sections from a parametrization of experimental data of the corresponding cross sections in free space .    as a first step ,",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath68 reactions .",
    "once we know this cross sections we can calculate the second term in eq.([basic1 ] ) .",
    "this channel is also the basis to study @xmath69 , since the parameters of the @xmath68 reactions are ingredients for calculating the reaction @xmath69 in the present model .    in this paper",
    ", we present results for all @xmath15 reactions using a resonance model .",
    "part of this work has been briefly reported in @xcite . by a resonance model",
    "we mean that the @xmath70 reactions happen via intermediate resonance states , which decay both into @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the coupling constants in the meson - baryon - resonances can be determined from the relevant branching ratios of the resonances .",
