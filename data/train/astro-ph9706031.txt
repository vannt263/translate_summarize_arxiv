    "the double neutron star ( dns ) system containing psr 1913 + 16 , discovered in 1975 by hulse & taylor , was the first binary pulsar for which observational data strongly suggested that both components were compact objects . following psr 1913 + 16",
    ", additional dns candidate systems have been discovered : psr 2303 + 46 ( stokes , taylor , & dewey 1985 ) , psr 2127 + 11c ( anderson et al . 1990 ) , psr 1534 + 12 ( wolszczan 1991 ) , and psr 1518 + 4904 ( nice , sayer , & taylor 1996 ) .",
    "the high orbital eccentricities of these systems separate them from all other binary radio pulsars , which are found in circular orbits ( e.g. , van den heuvel 1995 ) . measured and derived orbital and pulsar properties of these five systems are given in table 1 .",
    "one of the two members in each binary is a neutron star since it is detected as a radio pulsar . using a variety of tests",
    ", the nature of the companion to the pulsar has been investigated in detail for psr 1913 + 16 ( taylor & weisberg 1982 , 1989 ) and to a lesser extent for the other systems .",
    "extended companions are excluded based on their radial size , their implied periastron advances , and their apparent visual magnitudes , while helium stars of the same mass are even brighter ( crane , nelson , & tyson 1979 ; van kerkwijk 1996 ; webbink 1996 ) . for three of the systems ,",
    "white dwarf companions of various temperatures can potentially be ruled out using deep optical observations ( see table 2 ) .",
    "for the two most distant systems , psr 1913 + 16 and 2127 + 11c , there is no current observational test that can rule out white dwarf companions .",
    "however , the evolutionary history and high orbital eccentricities of these systems require that the pulsar companions were formed in supernova explosions that occurred after the pulsar spin - up phase ( srinivasan & van den heuvel 1982 ) .",
    "this provides indirect evidence that all of the pulsar companions are either neutron stars or black holes .",
    "the evolution of double neutron stars after the second supernova explosion is governed only by angular momentum losses due to emission of gravitational waves , and is not complicated by effects of binary - star evolution ( e.g. , nuclear evolution , mass transfer , stellar winds ) .",
    "these systems , therefore , constitute an ideal diagnostic for neutron star kicks .",
    "natal kicks are thought to be imparted to neutron stars at the time of their formation as a result of some asymmetry in the supernova explosion .",
    "evidence for the existence of such kicks originates in observations of radio pulsar velocities ( caraveo 1993 ; harrison , lyne , & anderson 1993 ; frail , goss , & whiteoak 1994 ; lyne & lorimer 1994 ) , o , b runaway stars ( stone 1991 ) , and x - ray binaries ( van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 ; kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) , and estimates of their average magnitudes vary from @xmath2 to @xmath3km / s ( dewey & cordes 1987 ; bailes 1989 ; fryer , burrows , & benz 1997 ) .    in this paper , we thoroughly investigate the four double neutron star systems found in the galactic field to identify the allowed binary characteristics of their immediate progenitors and to constrain the nature of the natal kick required for their formation . in  2 , we examine the possibility that dnss are formed via symmetric supernova explosions . based on arguments related to orbital dynamics and , in contrast to previous work , accounting for orbital evolution due to gravitational radiation",
    ", we find that the first neutron star in the observed systems always lies within the envelopes of their exploding companions . in the past",
    ", similar conclusions were reached for some of the systems ( burrows & woosley 1986 ; yamaoka , shigeyama , & nomoto 1993 ) , although the fate of the engulfed neutron stars was not addressed in any detail .",
    "we use recent results on neutron - star common - envelope phases , and conclude that the second supernova explosions in dns systems could not have been symmetric . in  3 , we account for the effects of kicks imparted to nascent neutron stars and find that the observed systems can then be reproduced .",
    "previous studies ( burrows & woosley 1986 ; wijers , van paradijs , & van den heuvel 1992 ; yamaoka , shigeyama , & nomoto 1993 ) have considered kicks of specific magnitude or direction or have indicated plausible values of progenitor parameters and kick magnitudes . here , we are able to ( i ) identify the ranges of values within which the properties of the immediate progenitors of the observed dnss are restricted , and ( ii ) derive an absolute lower limit to the magnitude of the kick velocity needed for their formation . we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results for the intrinsic kick velocity distribution and the center - of - mass velocities of double neutron stars .",
    "the existence of double neutron stars has instigated studies of their origin and a variety of evolutionary sequences have been proposed for their formation ( flannery & van den heuvel 1975 ; webbink 1975 ; smarr & blandford 1976 ; srinivasan & van den heuvel 1982 ; van den heuvel , kaper , & ruymaekers 1994 ; brown 1995 ; terman & taam 1995 ) .",
    "regardless of the details of prior evolution , all mechanisms converge to the same configuration before the formation of the second neutron star : a binary consisting of a neutron star and a helium star in a circular orbit .",
    "the helium star then collapses to form the companion to the observed radio pulsar .",
    "a possible exception is psr 2127 + 11c , which is found in the dense stellar environment of a globular cluster and may have formed via dynamical interactions ( capture or exchange : anderson et al .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis to the four dns systems found in the galactic field .    in this section , we assume that the supernova explosion of the helium star is symmetric , its only effect being an instantaneous mass loss from the system . since the companion of the exploding star is a neutron star , we may neglect any interaction between the radio pulsar and the supernova ejecta . combining the results for the pre - sn configuration with recent developments on common envelope evolution of inspiraling neutron stars ,",
    "we conclude that the four double neutron star systems found in the galactic field could not have been formed if supernova explosions were symmetric .      in order to obtain the post - sn parameters for each of the known systems , we must account for orbital evolution due to gravitational wave emission ( wijers ,",
    "van paradijs , & van den heuvel 1992 recognized the distinction between present and post - sn characteristics , but did not include this effect in their analysis ) .",
    "for each system , the extent of orbital evolution depends on the time , @xmath4 , elapsed since the supernova explosion .",
    "since the radio pulsar has been recycled prior to the supernova explosion , its age sets an upper to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the difference between the two times is of the order of the lifetime of the helium star ( @xmath6yr ; see habets 1985 ) .",
    "the `` characteristic age '' of the pulsar defined as @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pulsar spin period and its derivative ) is often used as a measure of the pulsar age .",
    "however , this estimate is strongly model dependent ( assumptions about the form of the braking law , the pulsar magnetic field and the initial spin period ) , and hence the upper limit on @xmath4 , may be considerably different than the value of @xmath10 ( e.g. , lyne & graham - smith 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , in our calculations , we treat @xmath4 as a free parameter ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "we use the expressions derived by junker & schaefer ( 1992 ) for orbital evolution due to gravitational radiation to integrate backwards in time , and calculate the post - sn orbital separations , @xmath13 , and eccentricities , @xmath14 , from the observed values ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this effect is strongest for the two systems with short orbital periods , psr 1913 + 16 and psr 1534 + 12 ( see figure 1 ) .    for a given set of post - sn characteristics",
    ", we can calculate the corresponding parameters just prior to the explosion .",
    "we denote these parameters with a subscript `` @xmath16 '' .",
    "the radio pulsar mass , @xmath17 , remains the same before and after the explosion .      in the case of circular pre - sn orbits , the orbital separation , @xmath18 , and mass , @xmath19 , of the exploding star",
    "are given by ( see also blaauw 1961 ; boersma 1961 ) : @xmath20 and @xmath21    according to the current formation mechanisms , the exploding star is an helium star .",
    "during the course of their evolution , helium stars less massive than @xmath223.5m@xmath1 expand significantly .",
    "we use a fit for the maximum helium - star radius , @xmath23 , as a function of its mass , @xmath24 , ( kalogera & webbink 1996 ) based on helium star models calculated by habets ( 1985 ) ( which are consistent with the models of woosley , langer , & weaver 1995 ) : @xmath25    using equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) we calculate the pre - sn separations , @xmath18 , progenitor masses of the pulsar companions , @xmath19 , and the ratios of orbital separations over helium - star maximum radii , @xmath26 , as functions of @xmath4 .",
    "the results for psr 1913 + 16 and psr 1534 + 12 are shown in figure 2 , while the ranges of values for all systems are given in table 3 .",
    "it is evident that for all observed dnss and for a wide range of @xmath4 , the stellar radius of the helium star exceeds the orbital separation . in other words",
    ", if the explosion were symmetric , we find that in the progenitors of _ all _ the observed systems , the radio pulsar would lie within the envelope of its companion at the time of the supernova explosion ( see also burrows & woosley 1986 ; yamaoka et al . 1993 ) .",
    "all current formation scenarios for double neutron star systems lead to circularization of the pre - sn orbits as the first neutron star gets recycled .",
    "however , the pulsars may not be recycled or there may be a way to recycle the pulsar without circularizing the orbit of the system .",
    "hence , we examine our conclusion that the pulsar would be in a common envelope phase at the time of the explosion , in the case of eccentric pre - sn orbits .    in this general case ,",
    "the relations between the pre- and post - sn parameters have been derived by hills ( 1983 ) : @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the distance between the two stars with masses @xmath19 and @xmath17 , at the time of the supernova explosion .",
    "there are four unknown pre - sn parameters : the orbital separation , @xmath18 , the helium - star mass , @xmath19 , the pre - sn eccentricity , @xmath30 , and the distance , @xmath29 , between the two stars at the time of the explosion .",
    "since we only have two equations , we treat two of the above quantities , @xmath30 and @xmath19 , as parameters and solve for @xmath18 and @xmath29 . note that @xmath29 can acquire values only within a restricted range , between periastron and apastron of the pre - sn orbit .",
    "the ratio of the periastron distance to the maximum radius for the helium star as a function of @xmath19 and for a complete range of pre - sn eccentricities is shown in figure 3 for all four of the observed systems ( see also table 3 ) .",
    "we see that although for psr 2303 + 46 and 1518 + 4904 the ratio @xmath31 might exceed unity , for psr 1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 the pulsar would lie well within the envelope of the helium star . therefore ,",
    "if the supernova explosions were symmetric , the pulsars in at least two of the observed dns systems would experience common envelope evolution , even in the extreme case of eccentric pre - sn orbits .      for a symmetric explosion , the immediate progenitors of double neutron star systems must evolve through a common - envelope phase . in this section",
    ", we use recent results on rapid accretion onto neutron stars to examine their fate in the envelopes of evolved helium stars .",
    "we conclude that survival of neutron stars through such phases is not possible .",
    "accretion of matter onto the neutron star in common envelope phases has been recently studied by various investigators ( chevalier 1993 , 1996 ; brown 1995 ; fryer , benz , & herant 1996 ) . in common envelope situations ,",
    "the bondi - hoyle accretion rate ( bondi 1952 ) typically exceeds @xmath32m@xmath33 , which is much greater than the photon eddington limit for neutron stars . for such high accretion rates , neutrino emission dominates the cooling processes .",
    "accretion is not limited by the photon eddington limit , but instead by the corresponding limit for neutrinos , which is 20 orders of magnitude greater than the photon eddington limit . for the calculated bondi - hoyle rates , neutrino emission carries away the energy released by accretion , a steady state accretion flow at high rates",
    "is achieved , and the pulsar collapses into a black hole on time scales of hours or months .",
    "depending on the conditions in the common envelope , other physical processes can facilitate the survival of the neutron star .",
    "chevalier ( 1996 ) showed that the angular momentum of the accreted material may prevent rapid accretion and hence collapse of the neutron star into a black hole .",
    "also , fryer et al . ( 1996 ) found that the neutrinos emitted close to the neutron star may be able to heat a region of the infalling atmosphere , and ultimately drive a small scale explosion which temporarily halts mass accretion .",
    "a series of such explosions may also prohibit the collapse of the neutron star into a black hole if a sizable amount of the atmosphere can be blown off of the neutron star instead of being accreted .",
    "both of these effects depend sensitively on the bondi - hoyle infall rate onto the neutron star and they become more important as the infall rate decreases .",
    "the envelopes of hydrogen - rich giant stars ( with masses @xmath34m@xmath1 ) are less dense ( by at least one order of magnitude ) than those of helium - rich giants and have correspondingly lower infall rates .",
    "although , in helium giants , the infall rates are too high for angular momentum to limit the flow , it may well limit the accretion for some hydrogen giants ( see table 1 in fryer et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this section ,",
    "we calculate the time , @xmath35 , needed for a neutron star to collapse into a black hole ( for zero and maximum angular momentum of the material ) , and compare it to the evolutionary time , @xmath36 , from maximum radial extent of the helium star to its explosion .",
    "only if @xmath36 is shorter than @xmath35 the helium star will explode in a supernova before the neutron star collapses into a black hole .    for each of the observed systems and under the assumption of symmetric supernova explosions",
    ", we have derived the mass of the progenitor of the second neutron star as well as the pre - sn orbital separation , that is the position of the pulsar in the envelope of its companion at the time the core of the helium star collapses . using helium star models by woosley ( 1996 ) we calculate the bondi - hoyle accretion rates , @xmath37 , appropriate for the physical conditions in the helium envelopes ( see table 4 ) .",
    "we have assumed that the neutron star velocity in the envelope is equal to the pre - sn relative orbital velocity .",
    "these bondi - hoyle rates are too high for the explosions found by fryer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to occur . in the extreme case that angular momentum",
    "has no effect on accretion , matter is accreted by the neutron star at the bondi - hoyle rate .",
    "thus , we can calculate the corresponding time scale for collapse , @xmath35 , into a black hole , assuming that the amount of mass required for collapse is @xmath38m@xmath1 ( see table 4 ) .",
    "matter accreted onto the neutron star is expected to have angular momentum due to density and velocity gradients in the envelope . as a result ,",
    "infall of material is halted at all polar angles except in a cone around the poles defined by the angular momentum symmetry axis . for the extreme case of negligible angular momentum transport ,",
    "we derive a lower bound to the accretion rate onto the neutron star . for a given value of the specific angular momentum , @xmath39",
    ", there is a critical polar angle , @xmath40 , within which angular momentum does not affect the inflow appreciably .",
    "this angle is set by the balance between the centrifugal and gravitational forces at the neutron star radius ( in the newtonian limit ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the gravitational mass and radius of the neutron star , assumed here to be equal to @xmath44m@xmath1 and @xmath45 cm , respectively .",
    "for the specific angular momentum we use the analytical estimates by ruffert & anzer ( 1995 ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the velocity of the neutron star , @xmath48 is the bondi - hoyle accretion radius ( bondi 1952 ) , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the velocity and density gradient parameters , as defined in ruffert & anzer ( 1995 ) .",
    "we note that their numerical calculations indicate that the above expression ( eq . [ 7 ] ) overestimates the amount of angular momentum accreted onto the neutron star , and therefore the corresponding mass accretion rate we derive is an underestimate . using the helium - star models by woosley ( 1996 ) we calculate @xmath39 and @xmath40 . for accretion restricted within the polar regions ,",
    "we obtain an extreme lower limit to the accretion rate onto the neutron star and a corresponding upper limit to the characteristic time scale for collapse , @xmath35 .",
    "the neutron star will avoid the collapse into a black hole only if @xmath35 is longer than the evolutionary time interval , @xmath36 , between the time the helium star acquires its maximum radial extent and the time it explodes as a supernova . for all of the observed systems ( with the possible exception of psr 1518 + 4904 ) , the collapse time scale is many orders of magnitude _",
    "shorter _ than the evolution time scale , which clearly indicates that the pulsar becomes a black hole long before the sn explosion .    in view of the above analysis",
    ", we conclude that the pulsar can not survive a common - envelope phase with its helium star companion .",
    "nevertheless , such a phase could not be avoided if the explosion were symmetric , and hence would not lead to the formation of the double neutron star systems .",
    "we have already shown that if supernovae explosions were symmetric , the first - born neutron stars would have collapsed into black holes during a common - envelope phase with their helium - star companions , thus aborting dns formation . in this section , we find that asymmetric explosions , during which kicks are imparted to nascent neutron stars , allow the formation of the observed double neutron star systems ( see also yamaoka et al .",
    "the pre - sn parameters of their progenitors are still restricted within relatively narrow ranges , which depend on the magnitude of the kick velocity , the time elapsed since the sn explosion , and the eccentricity of the pre - sn orbits . for each of the systems we are able to evaluate the minimum kick magnitude required for its formation .",
    "first , we study the case of circular pre - sn orbits , consistent with all current dns formation mechanisms . using the orbital energy and angular momentum equations for eccentric orbits , and for a kick velocity of specific magnitude and direction , expressions for the pre - sn orbital separation , @xmath18 , and mass of the helium star , @xmath19 , as a function of the post - sn binary characteristics",
    "can be derived ( e.g. , hills 1983 ; kalogera 1996 ) : @xmath51 @xmath52~=~g\\,(m_p+m_c)\\,a\\ , ( 1-e^2)\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the relative orbital velocity before the explosion , @xmath54^{1/2}\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] @xmath55 is the magnitude of the kick , @xmath56 is the polar angle of the kick with respect to the pre - sn orbital velocity of the helium star relative to the pulsar , and @xmath57 is the corresponding azimuthal angle , so that @xmath58 represents a plane perpendicular to @xmath18 .",
    "for each of the observed dns systems , the post - sn parameters are known .",
    "first , we calculate the orbital evolution due to gravitational radiation assuming @xmath59 ( table 1 ) , and discuss how variations in @xmath4 affect our results at the end of this section . for a specified kick magnitude in any direction ,",
    "we calculate the two unknown pre - sn parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the region of allowed pairs of values is restricted by a set of constraints that dns progenitors must satisfy .",
    "the first of the constraints arises from the fact that the post - sn orbit must include the position of the two stars at the time of the explosion ( e.g. , flannery & van den heuvel 1975 ; yamaoka et al . 1993",
    "; kalogera 1996 ) , hence the pre - sn separation must be within the bounds set by the periastron and apastron distances in the post - sn orbit @xmath60 these two limits follow from equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) with the constraint that @xmath61 , where the equality corresponds to kicks restricted to the plane perpendicular to @xmath18 .",
    "a second constraint is set by demanding that @xmath62 remains always positive .",
    "using equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) we find that for a specific pre - sn separation the mass of the helium star is restricted to : @xmath63 - 4 \\alpha^2 ( 1-e^2)^{1/2 }   \\left [ \\alpha^2 \\ , ( 1-e^2 ) - k \\right]^{1/2 } } - m_p \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath64\\ ] ] and @xmath65 .",
    "the extreme case of @xmath66 corresponds to kicks restricted to the plane of the orbit before the explosion .",
    "the final constraint arises from the condition that the pulsar must avoid a common envelope phase with the helium star .",
    "the ranges of allowed values for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are then restricted by the condition that the helium star must fit within its roche lobe when its radius is at a maximum ( eq . [ 3 ] ) . at a given value of @xmath18",
    ", a lower limit is derived for the mass of the helium star , since the maximum radii decrease with increasing helium - star mass .",
    "the limits imposed on pre - sn orbital separations , @xmath18 , and helium - star masses , @xmath19 , are shown in figures 4 and 5 for the two observed systems for which the individual masses are accurately known ( psr 1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 ) . for the close dns systems , the value of @xmath18 is restricted in the range @xmath67 r@xmath68 and that of @xmath19 must exceed @xmath69m@xmath68 , whereas , for the two wide systems ( psr 2303 + 46 and 1518 + 4904 ) , it is @xmath70r@xmath68 and @xmath71m@xmath68 .",
    "the solid thick vertical line corresponds to the geometrical constraint ( eq.[11 ] ) and sets an upper limit on the pre - sn orbital separation .",
    "although there also exists a lower limit to @xmath18 , its value is too low to restrict the parameter space .",
    "the thin lines correspond to kicks imparted in the pre - sn orbital plane ( @xmath66 ) , and thus to maximum helium star masses ( eq.[12 ] ) ; of the three limiting constraints this is the only one that depends on the assumed kick magnitude .",
    "as the magnitude of the kick velocity increases , the relative orbital velocity of allowed dns progenitors also increases , and systems with shorter separations and more massive helium stars are included in the progenitor parameter space ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "for the two close systems , psr 1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 , and for a dns age equal to @xmath10 , the pulsar companions must have been imparted a kick of at least 260 and 220km / s , respectively . for the wider systems , psr 2303 + 46 and 1518 + 4904 , the minimum kick magnitudes are lower , 70 and 50km / s , respectively .",
    "the parameter space allowed to dns progenitors depends also on the time , @xmath4 , elapsed since the supernova explosion , during which significant orbital evolution due to gravitational wave emission possibly occurs .",
    "the limits on the ranges of pre - sn parameters are altered with the exception of the limiting curve related to the size of evolved helium stars ( thick solid lines in figures 4 and 5 ) . as the value of @xmath4 increases , post - sn separations and eccentricities increase too , and hence the maximum allowed pre - sn separations",
    "are shifted to higher values ( eq.[11 ] ) . the consequent decrease in relative orbital velocity before the explosion also results in a decrease of the minimum kick magnitude required for the formation of the observed systems . for @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 )",
    "the minimum kick magnitude required decreases to 170km / s and 190km / s ( increases to 290km / s and 225km / s ) for psr 1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 , respectively .",
    "for the two wide systems ( psr 2303 + 46 and 1518 + 4904 ) the effect of orbital evolution due to gravitational wave emission is negligible , and therefore the minimum kick magnitudes remain unaffected .",
    "although none of the current formation mechanisms requires an eccentric orbit for the pulsar - helium star binary , as in the case of symmetric explosions , we explore such a possibility and its effect on the pre - sn binary parameters . in the case of eccentric orbits ,",
    "the pre - sn parameter space becomes four - dimensional : the eccentricity , @xmath30 , and the position along the orbits at the time of the explosion expressed by the eccentric anomaly , @xmath74 , are added to the orbital separation , @xmath18 , and helium - star mass , @xmath19 .",
    "we sample the complete range of values for both @xmath30 ( 0 to 1 ) and @xmath74 ( 0 to @xmath75 ) , and calculate the outer envelope of the limits imposed on pre - sn separation and mass of the exploding star , based on the three constraints discussed above .",
    "these limits are shown in figure 6 for psr 1913 + 16 and psr 1534 + 12 for two different values of the kick magnitude and for post - sn parameters corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "the area of the parameter space allowed to dns progenitors is enclosed by the limiting curves",
    ". the lower limit on @xmath19 represents the constraint that the helium star at its maximum extent must fit within the orbit .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to kicks restricted to the orbital plane ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath77 is no longer restrictive for the progenitor parameters .",
    "since the explosion is instantaneous , the distance , @xmath29 , between the two binary members before and after the supernova remains unchanged : @xmath78 in the limit of nearly parabolic pre - sn orbits and for @xmath79 , no upper limit can be set to the orbital separation , @xmath18 . as the magnitude of the kick increases , wider and more eccentric progenitor orbits and more massive helium stars are allowed .",
    "however , we note that helium stars are known to lose mass in strong stellar winds and thus their masses at collapse are expected to be relatively small ( @xmath80m@xmath1 ) ( woosley , langer , & weaver 1995 ) . despite the expansion of the parameter space allowed to dns progenitors , the minimum kick magnitude required to form the observed systems remains practically unaltered .",
    "a careful account of the change in orbital characteristics of binary systems experiencing symmetric supernova explosions , of the sizes of helium stars approaching collapse into a neutron star , and of recent results concerning the fate of neutron stars within the envelopes of helium stars , led us to conclude that the observed double neutron star systems in the galactic disk could not have been formed if the sn explosions forming the pulsar companions were symmetric .",
    "natal kicks imparted to neutron stars are required to explain the observed parameters of dns systems , even if they have experienced significant orbital evolution after their formation due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "in fact , only when kicks have magnitudes exceeding some minimum value can the progenitor orbits be sufficiently wide to accommodate evolved helium stars , and yet produce the small separations measured in these systems . for the observed double neutron stars in close orbits ,",
    "the minimum kick velocities required are in excess of 200km / s .",
    "the analysis presented here has enabled us to constrain the orbital parameters of the immediate progenitors of the observed dns systems . however , obtaining the most probable of the parameters within the allowed ranges requires modeling of the evolutionary history of the dns progenitors up to the formation of the pulsar / helium - star binaries .",
    "we have used the population synthesis code ( monte carlo ) described in fryer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to obtain an estimate of the most probable kick velocities , and hence progenitor parameters , for the observed systems .",
    "the standard dns formation mechanism ( srinivasan & van den heuvel 1982 ) is modeled , including the constraint that the helium stars must be accommodated in their orbits prior to collapse .",
    "the formation rate of dns systems with separations @xmath81 peaks at @xmath82km / s ( @xmath83yr@xmath84 ) , and falls off sharply beyond @xmath85km / s .",
    "although higher kicks are allowed by our analysis , they disrupt most of the binaries and do not contribute significantly to dns formation . for double neutron star systems with separations @xmath86 r@xmath68 , the formation rate ( @xmath87yr@xmath84 ) peaks at kicks lower than 100km / s , and is consistent with the rate inferred observationally ( van den heuvel 1995 ) .",
    "these results indicate that kick velocities close to the derived lower limits are favored .",
    "consequently , progenitor orbital separations and masses of @xmath88r@xmath1 and @xmath88m@xmath1 are favored for the close systems ( psr 1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 ) .",
    "separations of @xmath89r@xmath1 and @xmath90r@xmath1 are more probable for the progenitors of psr 2303 + 46 and psr 1518 + 4904 , respectively , with helium - star masses of @xmath91m@xmath1 in each case .",
    "we use our knowledge of the parameters of dns progenitors to calculate the center - of - mass velocities , @xmath92 , acquired by the systems after the explosion ( equation 34 in kalogera 1996 ) , for a specific kick magnitude . for each observed system",
    ", the lowest possible value of @xmath93 corresponds to the minimum kick magnitude needed for its formation , and to the progenitor binary with the lowest orbital relative velocity ( widest orbit and least massive helium star ) .",
    "for the two systems in close orbits ( psr 1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 ) we find minimum center - of - mass velocities of 200km / s and 225km / s , respectively .",
    "since the results of our synthesis calculations of dns formation favor low kick magnitudes , these minimum center - of - mass are also the most probable .",
    "we note that if the age of the system is longer than @xmath10 , for example is equal to 10@xmath10 , then the center - of - mass velocities are reduced to 100km / s and 185km / s , respectively .",
    "for the two wider systems , the minimum values of @xmath92 are considerably lower , @xmath94km / s .",
    "measurements of proper motions of the observed dnss have been reported in the literature the past few years ( taylor 1993 ; arzoumanian 1995 ; frail 1996 ; nice 1996 ) .",
    "the inferred values of _ transverse _ velocities for the two close systems , psr 1913 + 16 and 1534 + 12 , are @xmath95110km / s and @xmath95160km / s . for psr 1518 + 4904",
    "only an upper limit of 40km / s can be set , while for psr 2303 + 46 there is no significant measurement .",
    "we note , however , that these values depend sensitively on the distance estimates .",
    "moreover , these measurements include only the transverse component of the space velocities and the number of systems is too low for any statistically significant conclusions to be drawn .",
    "although we should bear in mind that many uncertainties are involved and the current proper motion data do not allow any reliable conclusions to be drawn , we note that our results are consistent with the trend of close systems having higher center - of - mass velocities .",
    "we are grateful to dimitrios psaltis for invaluable discussions and comments on the manuscript .",
    "we thank ron webbink for a critical review of the manuscript , and also fred lamb , doug swesty , and icko iben for participating in a discussion about kicks at the early stages of this work .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank stan woosley for kindly providing us with unpublished helium star models .",
    "we much appreciate dale frail s and david nice s efforts to collect and provide us with current measurements of dns proper motions , as well as helpful discussions with paul harding and jim liebert on the observational prospects of the pulsar companions .",
