    "in the last years a widespread attention has been devoted to the role played by the isospin degree of freedom in the heavy  ion reaction physics .",
    "the interest on this subject is twofold : the knowledge of the symmetry term in the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter , which is a fundamental ingredient in astrophysical investigations @xcite , and the thermostatistical properties both at equilibrium and out of equilibrium of systems with two strongly interacting components @xcite . both the interests concern systems faraway from the physical conditions of ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "thanks to the availability of high  performance @xmath1detectors for the investigations of heavy ",
    "ion collisions at intermediate energy @xcite , recent experimental results can provide new insights about isospin effects on the nuclear dynamics .",
    "in particular , for multifragmentation processes we can obtain information about highly excited two  component systems and their subsequent decomposition .",
    "statistical models have been extensively applied to the description of experimental data , also for isospin observables @xcite , and some conclusions have been drawn on the behavior of charge asymmetric systems .",
    "these models , however , imply the achievement of the statistical equilibrium for the nuclear system .",
    "then , it would be highly desireable to have some insight on the path followed by the system to attain equilibrium , if this occurs .",
    "further , it would be of great advantage to envisage some observable , which preserves memory of the dynamical processes occurred during the fragmentation .",
    "in this paper we present an analytical description of the disassembly of excited nuclear systems formed during the collision of heavy ions , in terms of the occurrence of nuclear matter instabilities .",
    "our approach accounts for the source of the density fluctuations occurring when the system enters the spinodal instability region of the density  temperature phase diagram , and describes the growth of the fluctuations with time until they cause the decomposition of the system .",
    "this approach is a generalization to include the isospin degree of freedom , of the model developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for symmetric nuclear matter basically .",
    "this gives rise to a substantial improvement of the model , with new valuable results .",
    "such extension allows us to investigate separately fluctuations of the neutron and proton densities and their interplay . following the procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , we identify the pattern of the domains containing correlated density fluctuations , with the fragmentation pattern , and can make predictions on the isotopic distributions of the fragments .",
    "moreover , we include in the present treatment the coulomb force according to the approach outlined in ref .",
    "its effects on the isotopic distributions turn out to be sizeable .",
    "our results essentially refer to the distributions of the fragments just after the early break  up of the system .",
    "so our approach can be considered complementary to dynamical model calculations based upon semiclassical kinetic equations for one  body phase ",
    "space density , ( for a review on dynamical models see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , as far as the description of the early fragmentation mechanism is concerned .",
    "the advantage here is that one can make significant predictions on observables of experimental interest on an analytical basis .",
    "this allows us to directly relate the results obtained to the eos properties and the features of the spinodal mechanism . in our scheme",
    "the onset and the growth of the fluctuations about the mean phase  space density in unstable situations , are self  consinstently treated .",
    "the self  consistency condition is provided by the fluctuation  dissipation theorem . whereas all the processes , which take place before the system enters the spinodal instability region and after the break  up , are beyond our approach .",
    "therefore the mean values of density , temperature and asymmetry of the nuclear medium when the system starts to break up are taken from calculations performed within dynamical models .",
    "on the other side , a dynamical model , which appropriately incorporates the effects of the fluctuations , might give a detailed description of the whole history of a collision between heavy ions .",
    "therefore , it can be of interest to compare the results of our approach with those obtained by numerical solutions of microscopic transport equations , also to connect the results of the simulations to what is expected in a pure spinodal decomposition scenario .",
    "the comparison will be done with the isotopic distributions for the primary fragments , calculated in the dynamical stochastic mean  field ( smf ) approach of refs .",
    "in particular , we will consider the ratio , for a given value of the proton number , between the isotope yields from two different reactions .",
    "this quantity represents a straightforward mean to compare isotopic distributions , since it is experimentally found to obey a simple relationship ( isoscaling ) , as a function of the proton number and neutron number @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss the dependence of the isoscaling parameters on the eos considered .    in sec .",
    "ii we outline the extension of the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite only for isoscalar density fluctuations , to include the isospin degree of freedom . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the results of our calculations and their comparison with the calculations performed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the smf approach .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "iv a brief summary and conclusions are given .",
    "we study the density fluctuations by introducing a self  consistent stochastic field acting on the constituents of the system .",
    "the time evolution of the fluctuations is described by a kinetic equation , within a linear approximation for the stochastic field .",
    "the growth of fluctuations is essentially dominated by the unstable mean field .",
    "thus we focus our attention on the behavior of the mean field and neglect the collision term in the kinetic equation .",
    "collisions would mainly add a damping to the growth rate of the fluctuations and should not change the main results of our calculations , at least at a qualitative level .    the additional stochastic mean field , which we assume having a vanishing mean , will induce fluctuations of the proton and neutron densities , @xmath2 , with respect to their uniform mean values @xmath3 (  @xmath4 for protons and neutrons respectively  ) .",
    "we assume that at the time @xmath5 , given density fluctuations @xmath6 are present in the system .",
    "the equations for the fourier coefficients of @xmath7 for @xmath8 are given by a generalization of the equation for the isoscalar density fluctuations of ref .",
    "they read @xmath9 where the @xmath10 matrix in the isospin space , @xmath11 , is the density ",
    "density response function and @xmath12 its time fourier transform . for symmetry reasons the response function and its fourier transform depend only on the magnitude of the wave vector . in the last integral",
    "@xmath13 gives the contribution of the @xmath14component of the stochastic field in the interval @xmath15 . since the stochastic field is real @xmath16 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the fourier coefficients @xmath17 are indipendent components of a multivariate stochastic process @xcite , with @xmath18 defining the correlator for the stochastic field .",
    "angular brackets denote ensemble averaging .    in the mean  field approximation",
    "the response function obeys the following set of equations @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the non  interacting particle  hole propagator and @xmath21 is the fourier transform of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon effective interaction .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that , in the case of isoscalar fluctuations in symmetric nuclear matter , a white  noise hypothesis for the stochastic field can be retained for values of temperature and density sufficiently close to the borders of the spinodal region . in such situations",
    "the imaginary part of the response function displays a sharp peak dominating the particle ",
    "hole background at a value of @xmath22 .",
    "this is due to the occurrence of a pole on the imaginary axis of @xmath23 , that corresponds to isoscalar fluctuations , at a distance from the origin that is much smaller than the values of @xmath24 .",
    "the position of this pole determines the time scale characteristic of the response function .",
    "however , when one wants to investigate the properties of neutron and proton distributions , as we do in the present study , one should consider also the effects due to the isovector fluctuations .",
    "even though isoscalar modes are the dominant ones , since they are unstable , isovector fluctuations contribute to the width of the isotopic distributions of the fragments formed in the spinodal decomposition process .",
    "in asymmetric nuclear matter isovector and isoscalar fluctuations are coupled .",
    "however one can still distinguish oscillations with neutrons and protons moving in phase ( isoscalar - like ) or out of phase ( isovector - like ) .",
    "let us first concentrate on the properties of the isoscalar - like modes .",
    "the position of the pole @xmath25 for the unstable isoscalar - like mode is given by the imaginary root of the equation @xmath26 the quantity @xmath27 is the damping or growth rate ( depending on its sign ) of the density fluctuations . in evaluating it , we use the expression of @xmath20 for @xmath22 @xcite @xmath28 where the effective chemical potential @xmath29 of neutrons or protons is measured with respect to the uniform mean field @xmath30 of the unperturbed initial state and @xmath31 is the function @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the inverse temperature ( we use units such that @xmath34 ) .    substituting into eq .",
    "( [ wiener ] ) the response function @xmath11 calculated with these approximations , the equation for the fluctuations @xmath35 becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the residues , times @xmath38 , of the components of the response function at the pole @xmath25 .",

    "the probability distribution of density fluctuations , @xmath43 $ ] , is given by a product of gaussian distributions .",
    "each single factor corresponds to the stochastic process of eq .",
    "( [ ornul ] ) for a given wave number @xmath44 @xcite , with the covariance matrix @xmath45 for simplicity , we have assumed that the initial fluctuations are negligible @xmath46 . whenever it is necessary",
    ", a nonvanishing covariance can be easily introduced .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath43 $ ] is completely determined once the covariance matrix @xmath47 is known . according to",
    "the procedure usually followed when treating instabilities by exploiting the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , we determine the coefficients @xmath48 as functions of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the system at equilibrium , then we extend the expressions so found to non  equilibrium cases . since the relevant values of the wave vector @xmath44 turn out to be such that the quantity @xmath24 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath51 , the limit @xmath52 also implies @xmath53 . in such case , the classical limit @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) can be taken when evaluating both sides of the fluctuation  dissipation relation .",
    "then , we get @xmath55 the equation for the equilibrium fluctuations can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ wiener ] ) by shifting the initial time @xmath5 to @xmath56 . by exploiting eq .",

    "following refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite on this point ) we assume that the relation ( [ fdt1 ] ) is valid also in instability situations . in such a way , the covariance matrix ( [ variance0 ] ) acquires the form @xmath59 and is completely determined both for stable and unstable situations . we notice that , for the isoscalar - like mode , @xmath60 is positive .",
    "in fact proton and neutron densities oscillate in phase , although with different amplitudes in general .",
    "however , the ratio between amplitudes , @xmath61 , is found to be larger than the initial proton to neutron ratio , thus leading to the formation of more symmetric fragments , the so - called isospin distillation effect @xcite .",
    "now we turn to consider the isovector - like modes . in this case",
    "the frequency of the modes , @xmath62 is real , i.e. we have stationary oscillations .",
    "the position of the pole is given by the other solution of eq .",
    "( [ det ] ) . however , we add a small negative imaginary part @xmath63 to the position of the pole , taking into account that here we are neglecting nucleon - nucleon collisions and finite size effects .",

    "this is due to the fact that the `` soft '' asymmetry term , at the considered density , is more effective to drive fragments closer to the average asymmetry value , with respect to an asymmetry term with a stronger density dependence .",
    "indeed we find that , in spite of the competition with coulomb and surface effects , the isospin distillation mechanism does not change much with the wave number @xmath44 , in the `` soft '' case .",
    "the counterpart in our formalism is that in this case the behaviors of the components of the covariance matrix , as functions of @xmath44 , are more similar each other reducing the width of the isotopic distribution .",
    "however , adding the contributions due to the isovector - like fluctuations , the total width obtained in the `` soft '' case ( triangles ) becomes closer to the `` superstiff '' results .",
    "it is also possible to observe that the contribution of the isovector - like fluctuations to the full width is more important at smaller asymmetry .",
    "this is because isovector - like fluctuations become weaker when increasing the asymmetry of the matter .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows that the width of the isotopic yields increases with asymmetry .",
    "this corresponds to the general property that for more neutron  rich systems the density ",
    "density response function of neutrons is enhanced with respect to that of protons .",
    "in addition , we can see that the more neutron  rich system ( @xmath144 ) produces the more neutron ",
    "rich isotopes , as expected .",
    "it is worth to remark that both the overall behavior and the widths of the distributions of fig .",

    "in addition , the isoscaling relationship has been reproduced by smf ",

    "[ fig3 ] we compare the values of @xmath178 as a function of @xmath98 , obtained with the `` superstiff '' symmetry term and with the `` soft '' symmetry term .",
    "the linear behavior , in logaritmic scale , with the same slope for every @xmath97 is reproduced in both cases within a satisfying approximation .",
    "because of the smaller value of the width parameter @xmath91 , the `` soft '' symmetry term gives a steeper slope with respect to the `` superstiff '' term .",

    "[ fig4 ] the ratio @xmath178 is displayed for two values of the density of the system at the break  up . in order to obtain fluctuations of similar magnitude in the two cases , two different times the system spends in the instability region are considered .",

    "in this article we discuss relevant observables of multifragmentation processes in charge asymmetric nuclear matter , such as the isotopic distribution of intermediate ",
    "mass fragments , as obtained within the spinodal decomposition scenario , on the basis of an analytical approach .",
    "fragmentation happens due to the development of isoscalar - like unstable modes , i.e. unstable density oscillations with also a chemical component , leading to the formation of more symmetric fragments .",
    "we find that the isotopic distributions are peaked at a value given by the average distillation effect , while the width is determined by the dispersion of the chemical effect among the relevant unstable modes and by isovector - like fluctuations present in the matter that undergoes spinodal decomposition .",
    "the size of this dispersion is mostly due to the competition between symmetry energy effects ( that favour the formation of symmetric fragments ) and the coulomb repulsion , that acts against the concentration of protons in large density domains , expecially for modes with large wavelength .",
    "clearly the net result of this competion also depends on the eos used .",
    "smaller widths are obtained with a `` soft '' symmetry energy term .",
    "however , the contribution due to isovector - like fluctuations is more important in the `` soft '' case , indeed in the `` superstiff '' case isovector oscillations are suppressed . hence finally the isotopic distributions are quite similar when using the two parameterizations of the symmetry energy .    in particular , we find that , when considering two systems with different asymmetry , the isotopic ( or isotonic ) yields obey an approximate isoscaling , with a slope connected to the difference betwen the asymmetries of the two systems and to the differences between the widths of the isotopic distributions . hence isoscaling properties can be recovered in a dynamical picture .",
    "we notice that isoscaling has been found in dynamical simulations of heavy ion collisions , such as stochastic mean field @xcite and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics calculations @xcite .",
    "the isoscaling parameters are also connected to the properties of the symmetry term in the eos .",
    "indeed we have seen that a stiffer behavior of the symmetry energy term yields larger isotopic widths , leading to smaller values of the slope ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . however , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also observe that in collisions of charge asymmetric systems , pre - equilibrium emission is less neutron rich when using a stiffer parametrization of the symmetry term ( thus leading to more asymmetric fragments ) , with respect to the `` soft '' case .",
    "therefore , in the isoscaling analysis , there could be a compensation between the average asymmetry of fragments ( larger in the `` stiff '' case ) and the width of the distribution ( also larger in the `` stiff '' case ) .",
    "in fact , for the systems considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , similar values of the slope are obtained for the two parameterizations considered for the symmetry energy .",
    "it may also be interesting to notice that the values obtained in our calculations are larger than the predictions of statistical multifragmentation models , see ref .",
    "of course this picture can be modified by the secondary de - excitation process , that reduces the asymmetry of fragments and , consequently , the slopes deduced from isoscaling . hence the final distributions can be quite different from the primary ones . a more detailed study , aiming to extract information on the primary distributions and on the fragmentation mechanism , would require the introduction of more sophisticated observables , probably based on an event by event analysis , in line with the recent investigations of correlations between intermediate ",
