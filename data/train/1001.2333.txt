    "the appearance of background galaxies are subtly distorted due to weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) by mass along the line of sight .",
    "this wl effect is detectable as a breaking of symmetries in the intrinsic background scene , in particular a shearing that breaks the isotropy of the galaxy ellipticity distribution . because this `` cosmic shear '' is a direct measure of the metric fluctuations in the universe , it is readily used to constrain the dark matter and energy that dominate the gravitational behavior of our universe .",
    "a review of the cosmic shear method is provided by @xcite and the role of wl in the context of dark energy studies is summarized in @xcite .",
    "the cosmic shear signal is subtle and difficult to measure to high accuracy .",
    "the shear along a typical line of sight on cosmological scales causes a @xmath5 change in axis ratio of a background source .",
    "propagation of shear - estimation errors into cosmological parameter inferences suggests that systematic errors in shear estimation must be held below @xmath6 part in 1000 of the expected shear to avoid significant degradation of cosmological inferences @xcite . roughly speaking",
    "this means that systematic errors in the ellipticity @xmath7 of individual galaxies must be held below 1 part in 1000 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 . in community - wide blind tests of shear recovery from simulated data @xcite ,",
    "no methods have yet achieved this level of accuracy , even for simulated simplified images with unrealistically high signal - to - noise ( @xmath3 ) levels and perfect knowledge of the point spread function ( psf ) . as most recently reported by @xcite , methods that could be practically applied to real survey data produced shear estimates that were in error by @xmath9 or more of the typical cosmic shear signal .",
    "a biased and/or noisy shape measurement method can nonetheless be applied to real data if its biases are calibrated and compensated .",
    "a simple scheme is to fit the measured shear @xmath10 to the true ( simulated ) shear @xmath11 via @xmath12 the multiplicative and additive error terms @xmath13 and @xmath14 derived from simulations could then be applied to measured data . as a scalar , for simplicity . in practice",
    "the shear , ellipticities , additive and multiplicative error coefficients all have two components .",
    "we will also ignore the distinction between the shear @xmath15 and the reduced shear @xmath16 . ]",
    "the difficulty is that @xmath13 and @xmath14 will depend upon sets of parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 describing the properties of the source galaxies and point - spread function ( psf ) , respectively .",
    "if the simulation does not properly mimic the real populations , then the empirical correction will be in error  and we may not even know which parameters are the critical ones to emulate properly .",
    "a bayesian formalism can be used to derive an unbiased shear estimator @xmath19 from a collection of potentially biased shape estimates @xmath20 _ if _ we know all three of : the intrinsic distribution of galaxy shapes @xmath21 ; the change @xmath22 of the shape distribution under applied shear ; and the conditional probability @xmath23 of the measurement process @xcite .",
    "the need for such knowledge was previously noted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "the calibration is difficult , however , because the measurement process noise and bias will depend upon galaxy and psf properties , @xmath24 , so we need to know this function and also the distribution @xmath25 of all galaxy subsets of interest . characterizing all of these functions by simulation will be hard because of the wide variety of galaxy shapes on the sky and psf variation , especially if we do not know exactly what parameters are important .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to produce a shape - measurement algorithm that is minimally biased , and which produces distributions @xmath23 that are robust , _",
    "i.e. _ characterized by a few well understood properties of the galaxy or psf .",
    "any corrections that must be derived empirically ( via simulation ) should be as small as possible to minimize errors that arise from differences between the simulations and the real observations .",
    "furthermore the calibration depends on knowing the response @xmath22 of the noise - free , unsheared ellipticity population @xmath21 to an applied shear .",
    "if the shape - measurement methodology misestimates @xmath26 even in the absence of noise , then the calibration will be in error even if @xmath23 is known .",
    "if @xmath26 depends upon the detailed parameters @xmath17 and/or @xmath18 , then the calibration will depend upon knowledge of the complete distribution @xmath27 at all points in the survey .    in this context",
    "it is worrisome that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vb ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mblb ) demonstrate that shape - measurement techniques based on model - fitting to the observed data can be biased by @xmath28 part in 100 even in the absence of measurement noise .",
    "these biases arise when the models being fit are not well matched to the galaxies being measured , for example if an exponential - disk model or gauss - laguerre expansion is being fit to a devaucouleurs profile galaxy . in principle",
    "the shape measurement bias can be reduced by adding degrees of freedom to the model so that it spans all possible galaxy shapes , for example by using a complete set of basis functions to model the galaxy .",
    "this will , however , come at the expense of increased uncertainty on the inferred shear as the model fits become increasingly degenerate .",
    "in this paper we examine these `` underfitting '' biases more closely , and devise a shape - measurement technique that avoids the issue .",
    "then we investigate a more general effect revealed by the vb tests , in which a galaxy that has ellipticity varying with radius ( or more precisely , with the scale of the weight function ) leads to a mis - estimation of the applied lensing shear .",
    "we will show how this `` ellipticity gradient bias '' can be quantified and corrected using our newly proposed shear - measurement method .",
    "after controlling these two biases we are able to measure shear from high-@xmath3 galaxies to the desired accuracy .",
    "bj02 introduced a geometric definition of galaxy shape which is intended to eliminate the need for empirical shear calibration factors , at least for high-@xmath3 objects .",
    "this shape definition renders the derivative @xmath22 a universal function of @xmath21 , independent of any galaxy or psf parameters .",
    "we briefly summarize the notion of `` geometric '' shape assignment .",
    "the shearing action of lensing that we seek to detect is a mapping of the unlensed galaxy appearance @xmath29 to the apparent surface brightness @xmath30 via @xmath31 we take a unit - determinant version of the shear , so that for a shear along the @xmath32 axis , @xmath33 for shear at an angle @xmath34 to the @xmath32 axis , we apply the appropriate rotation matrices to @xmath35 and define @xmath36 @xmath37 it is more common to write a traceless magnification matrix @xmath38 the two variables for shear are related by @xmath39 .",
    "a shear - measurement method must infer the components of the applied shear @xmath40 from a collection @xmath41 of shapes assigned to galaxies @xmath42 .",
    "one crucial question is : how do we define @xmath41 for a galaxy with some @xmath30 ?    we will call a galaxy `` perfectly elliptical '' if all of its isophotes are true ellipses with constant axis ratio @xmath43 and position angle @xmath34 . for perfectly elliptical galaxies",
    ", the galaxy @xmath7 is straightforwardly defined as the isophotal ellipticity @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore an applied shear @xmath40 maps every such galaxy into another perfectly elliptical galaxy with ellipticity @xmath45 , and the map @xmath46 has the desired property of being independent of all other galaxy parameters . for an applied shear @xmath47 and an unlensed galaxy ellipticity oriented along the @xmath32 axis",
    ", the map can be linearized to ( bj02 ) : @xmath48 hence if all galaxies were perfectly elliptical and it were possible to observe their pre - seeing shapes @xmath49 at infinite @xmath3 , then a perfect shear estimator would arise from simply measuring the ellipticity of any single isophote .    among the many problems with the above method",
    "is that galaxies do not have perfectly similar elliptical isophotes .",
    "bj02 show that one can assign an ellipticity @xmath7 to a generic galaxy @xmath30 such that it is transformed by shear under the same model - independent formulae as the perfect ellipticities above . to do",
    "so we define a pair of _ roundness tests _",
    "@xmath50 for which :    1 .",
    "there is one and only one shear @xmath51 for which @xmath52 = t_2 [ i_a({\\bf s}_{\\eta_t}{\\bf x } ) ] = 0.\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "if @xmath53 holds for some @xmath54 , then it also holds after any rotation @xmath55 is applied to @xmath54 .",
    "the form of the roundness test is invariant under shear of the target galaxy .",
    "the first two conditions mean that a galaxy which nulls @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be considered `` round '' in the sense that any rotated version of the galaxy is still round , and any sheared version of the galaxy is no longer round .",
    "if a chosen galaxy nulls @xmath56 and @xmath57 at test shear @xmath51 , we assign the galaxy the ellipticity @xmath58 , since it is a `` round '' galaxy sheared by @xmath51 .",
    "the third condition then guarantees that this assigned ellipticity will transform under shear as in .",
    "it is often desirable for the form of @xmath59 to depend upon properties @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the galaxy and psf , _",
    "e.g. _ adjusted for galaxy and psf sizes to improve the measurement @xmath3 level .",
    "we will emphasize later however that it is critical that the roundness test be the same for sheared and unsheared versions of the same galaxy .",
    "we will assume that the roundness test is a linear function of @xmath30 , and hence is also a linear function of the fourier - domain intensity @xmath60 .",
    "it is typical to adopt a roundness test that has a quadrupole form , since shear induces a quadrupole on a circular galaxy .",
    "a radial weight function @xmath61 remains free : @xmath62    the result of the roundness tests will usually depend upon the choice of origin for the coordinate system  although there are methods for which this is not true , which work on the autocorrelation function or power spectrum of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "to fix the coordinate origin @xmath63 we can create two additional null tests . these tests must satisfy the three conditions given for the shear null test , with the difference that they are null for a unique translation @xmath63 rather than a unique shear .",
    "the obvious choices for linear centroid null tests are dipole moments with some radial weight @xmath64 : @xmath65 w_x(x^2+y^2 ) x = 0,\\\\ t_y(i_a ) & \\equiv & \\int dx\\,dy\\ , i_a[{\\bf s}_\\eta({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}_0 ) ] w_x(x^2+y^2 ) y = 0 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the centroid and ellipticity are hence determined by searching the @xmath66 space for the point where @xmath67 and @xmath57 are all nulled . when all null tests are linear functions of @xmath54 , the process can be equivalently cast in either real or fourier space .",
    "the _ observed _ galaxy image @xmath68 is always the lensed galaxy image convolved with some instrumental transfer function ( psf ) @xmath69 .",
    "we must however access the pre - seeing function @xmath54 somehow to apply the roundness tests .",
    "the technique proposed by bj02 is to assume that the roundness ( and centroid ) tests are all weighted integrals over @xmath54 with weight functions that are members of a set @xmath70 of functions that form a complete basis for functions on the plane .",
    "if the @xmath71 are orthonormal and complete , then there is a unique set of coefficients @xmath72 such that @xmath73.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the assignment of galaxy shape @xmath7 thus proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "for some trial @xmath40 ( and centroid choice ) , shift and shear the basis functions @xmath71 and convolve them with the psf .",
    "2 .   using the last of the equations above ,",
    "execute a linear least - squares fit to the observed galaxy to determine the coefficients @xmath72 . in the absence of noise , the @xmath72 that provide the decomposition in the first line must be a solution of this fit with @xmath74 , hence a best fit .",
    "3 .   iterate the trial shear and centroid to null the four @xmath72 which embody the roundness and centroid tests . from the second equation we see that these @xmath72 would be the result of applying the centroid test to the pre - seeing image @xmath54 .",
    "the galaxy is assigned an ellipticity corresponding to the shear that nulls the tests .",
    "[ more generally the null tests are four functions of the @xmath72 , but the principle remains similar . ]    an obvious drawback to this method is that the basis set must be infinite to span the full variety of all the galaxies on the sky .",
    "real data will not yield a unique solution to an infinite coefficient vector @xmath75 because the data are sampled on a bounded region .",
    "furthermore there must be regions where the transform @xmath76 of the psf is identically zero , which will induce degeneracies into the fit of an infinite basis set , even when there is no noise in the observations .",
    "we must therefore apply the method with _ a finite , incomplete basis set .",
    "_ @xcite notes that fitting methods can become biased estimators of shear when the models do not fit the galaxies exactly . here",
    "we explore the conditions under which biases develop .",
    "we simplify the situation by assuming that there is one coefficient @xmath77 that serves as a roundness test , and another coefficient @xmath78 that we will consider `` hidden '' because we will later truncate it from the model .",
    "assume that the galaxy is round in some coordinate system , which means that a complete decomposition of @xmath54 would yield values @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ covar ] , the the fitting process may induce non - zero correlation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .     for a fit to a galaxy with a model having two degrees of freedom , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath81 is a `` roundness test '' , _",
    "i.e. _ an indicator of shape , while @xmath82 is some additional parameter needed to obtain a complete model of the galaxy .",
    "the true values @xmath79 and @xmath83 are obtained from a full fit .",
    "however if we truncate the model so that @xmath82 is fixed to zero , then the best fit moves to @xmath84 , producing a bias in the measured shape . fitting to the full @xmath85 model",
    "may be disfavored , or even impossible to execute , because the resultant uncertainty on @xmath81 can become larger .",
    "however the truncated model will be biased . ]",
    "next consider that truncating the fit is equivalent to setting @xmath86 and seeking the best fit for @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath87 and @xmath83 , then the best - fit value @xmath88 will be non - zero .",
    "_ this will be manifested as an error in the assigned ellipticity . _",
    "note that the uncertainty on @xmath81 will be larger when @xmath82 is free than when @xmath82 is truncated ; in cases with finite noise , this may eventually produce some upper limit to the number of basis functions that can be included in the model .",
    "hence when the measurement process correlates the roundness test with other members of the basis set , there is an inevitable tradeoff between accuracy and bias in this fitting method .    in an ideal case of basis - function fitting ,",
    "( 1 ) the noise in the image is white , ( 2 ) there is no psf , and ( 3 ) the data is available over the full plane . in this case",
    "the coefficients of an orthonormal basis will be uncorrelated , so @xmath89 and there will be no bias from fitting a truncated basis set .",
    "correlations between basis coefficients are induced , however , by finite sampling , bounded data range , and especially by convolution with the psf ( bj02 , * ? ? ?",
    "the roundness test is typically a quadrupole , with @xmath90 azimuthal symmetry , in the sheared coordinate frame where the object is round .",
    "introduction of a covariance between @xmath81 and a hidden parameter with azimuthal order @xmath91 requires that the psf have elements with azimuthal order @xmath92 .",
    "`` selection rules '' for covariances induced by finite sampling and data range are more complex .",
    "we can tolerate biases in the measurements of individual galaxy ellipticities if we can be assured that they will go to zero when averaged over the full ( isotropic ) population of pre - lensing galaxy shapes .",
    "for the shear derived from a full population to be biased due to truncation of some parameter @xmath82 , we need @xmath93 both @xmath80 and the covariance must be evaluated in the sheared coordinate system in which the galaxy is round .",
    "consider the case when @xmath82 is the coefficient of a monopole basis function with high radial order , which is truncated from the fit to the data .",
    "for example vb attempt to fit a devaucouleurs - profile elliptical galaxy with a basis set consisting of one ( or a few ) gaussian ellipsoids . in the frame where these galaxies appear round , the galaxies have a monopole residual to the gaussian fit . if the psf is circular in the observed frame , then it is elliptical in this sheared frame , with an ellipticity 90@xmath94 out of phase with the original galaxy ellipticity .",
    "the @xmath95 components of this ( sheared ) psf will induce correlations between the amplitude @xmath82 of the truncated monopole basis function and the quadrupole component of the fit .",
    "these induced biases will always be aligned with the galaxy ellipticity .",
    "the result will be a multiplicative shear calibration error .",
    "underfitting can also result from unmodelled galaxy terms beyond the monopole .",
    "for example if galaxies tend to be disky , they have @xmath96 components with a well - defined phase relation to the galaxy ellipticity .",
    "these terms are coupled to the roundness test by the psf , potentially causing systematic over- or under - estimation of the ellipticity .",
    "a circular psf acting on an isotropic population of galaxies has no preferred direction and hence can not induce an additive shear error . if , however , the psf has anisotropic components , particularly at @xmath95 , then underfitting can induce additive errors by correlating the quadrupole roundness test with unmodelled monopole components of the galaxies .",
    "several shear - measurement methods assign ellipticities to galaxies by fitting the observed data with models of perfectly elliptical galaxies .",
    "we note that these are subject to the same underfitting biases .",
    "these methods work as follows :    1 .",
    "select a circularly symmetric model galaxy function @xmath97 .",

    "4 .   find the shear , centroid , and flux that maximize the likelihood of the data .",
    "the galaxy is assigned an ellipticity equal to the model shear that maximizes the likelihood .",
    "some methods choose to estimate the likelihood - weighted mean values rather than the maximum - likelihood values , but for the high-@xmath3 cases we consider now , the difference is unimportant .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use a method in which the circular model is a sum of gaussians ; @xcite have an exponential or devaucouleurs profile circular model .",
    "the method will clearly succeed without bias ( for high @xmath3 ) when the galaxies are indeed sheared versions of the proffered models .",
    "however for more general galaxies , these methods will be subject to the same biases as the truncated - basis - set methods described above .",

    "the circular - model - fitting technique will consider @xmath103 to be the correct center and shape for this galaxy if the likelihood @xmath104 of the fit of ( [ circbasis ] ) to the observed data satisfies @xmath105 and likewise for derivatives with respect to @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "however we can also view the five functions in ( [ circbasis ] ) as the first elements of some complete basis set , with the coefficients of the last four terms serving as our centroid and roundness null tests .",
    "the basis - set method will consider the galaxy to be round and centered in this frame if the likelihood of the fit of ( [ circbasis ] ) to the data is maximized by nulling the coefficients of the last four terms .",
    "this is exactly the same condition for shape assignment as in the circular - model - fitting technique .",

    "mblb report that these large errors may be attributable to a degenerate behavior of the fitting method : with very well - resolved devaucouleurs - profile galaxies , the condition used to defined the size scale of the gauss - laguerre basis set may lead to attempts to measure shapes by fitting the central intensity spike of the galaxy .",
    "the basis functions can then be poorly resolved by the image pixel scale .",
    "we do not investigate in this paper the domain where the psf - convolved image has structure well below the pixel scale , leaving this for future work .",

    "we see that galaxies with low sersic indices , close to the gaussian value of @xmath110 , are measured with shape biases below the 1 part in @xmath2 threshold , as long as they are well resolved",

    "all three of these factors lead the galaxy to be more poorly represented by the finite gl basis set , opening the door to underfitting biases .",
    "one way to avoid the underfitting bias would be to find a basis set in which all galaxies are compact and represented without significant bias by a finite number of coefficients , _ e.g. _ @xcite propose a basis set generated from sersic profiles , which may represent hubble - sequence galaxies more compactly than the gauss - laguerre basis sets used by nb07 and @xcite . a viable methodology from a sersic basis",
    "has not yet been reported , however .",
    "the less regular morphology of fainter galaxies may make it difficult to obtain a sufficiently general basis .",
    "we will not pursue this approach in this paper .",
    "a second strategy is to simply extend the basis set to higher order until the biases are reduced to desired level .",
    "the dashed lines in the left panel of figure  [ biases ] show the impact of increasing the gl expansion from order @xmath112 ( 45 basis functions ) to @xmath113 ( 91 basis functions ) .",
    "the biases are indeed substantially reduced in most cases , but remain unacceptably high for poorly resolved objects and for objects with higher @xmath114 and high ellipticity .",
    "we note however that a price has been paid , particularly for the poorly resolved objects , in that the resultant uncertainties in the ellipticity have risen substantially ( see lower row of plots ) .",
    "while this is not a problem for an object with @xmath115 , it will be a problem for real observations , where @xmath3 is expensive to obtain .",
    "why does going to higher order lead to higher noise primarily in the poorer - resolution cases ? recall that in the basis - set - fitting method , four basis functions are designated as the centroid and roundness tests . considering just one of these coefficients @xmath72 and its associated function @xmath71 , we know that as the basis set becomes more complete , the least - squares solution will converge ( at high @xmath3 ) to the desired limit @xmath116 we express the integral in fourier space because it is easier to understand the noise properties of convolved images in fourier space .",
    "we also work in a coordinate system where the object is nearly round , so that we are testing for @xmath117 and we can for the moment omit the @xmath118 matrices for clarity . for background - limited images ,",
    "the _ observed _ image @xmath119 has a uniform ( white ) noise spectrum @xmath120 .",
    "however to retrieve the pre - seeing image @xmath54 , we must divide by the modulation transfer function ( mtf ) , which is the fourier conjugate of the psf : @xmath121 .",
    "this means that the effective noise power on the pre - seeing image is @xmath122 , rising to infinity at higher @xmath1 .",
    "we thus expect that as the basis becomes complete , the measurement of the roundness test @xmath72 will acquire noise level @xmath123 if we have chosen a roundness test @xmath124 which goes to zero before the inverse mtf @xmath125 blows up , then the noise on @xmath72 will remain bounded as we increase the fit to high order .",
    "we can reduce bias by fitting to higher order without paying a stiff noise penalty only if we have chosen our roundness test to roll off more quickly than the mtf in @xmath1-space .",
    "if , however , we are using a roundness test that extends to regions where @xmath126 is large , then we will find the error on @xmath72 climbing higher and higher as we use more complete basis sets .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ kbias ] , this is precisely what happens when using a model - fitting technique on an unresolved galaxy .",
    "one would like to choose a basis function @xmath71 which is of similar size to the ( pre - seeing ) galaxy @xmath54 so that the representation of this galaxy is compact in the basis .",
    "however if the galaxy is smaller than the psf , then in fourier domain , the roundness test @xmath127 will extend to higher @xmath1 than the mtf @xmath128 , and the roundness test noise will diverge as the basis set becomes complete .",
    "space the image is very noisy .",
    "if we are testing galaxy roundness with a filter that is matched to the galaxy size , we will obtain a very noisy answer because the filter extends into the degraded zone . ]    when we use a roundness test that extends to @xmath1 values where the @xmath126 deconvolution term becomes large , we face a tradeoff between noise and bias : as we truncate the basis set to avoid fitting degeneracies at high @xmath1 , we become subject to bias if the truncated basis does not properly extrapolate behavior to high @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that underfitting bias stems , at root , from an attempt to measure galaxy shapes using information at high @xmath1 which is not present in the data .",

    "note that the roundness test goes to zero at any radius where the mtf drops to zero , so our roundness test never requires extrapolation into unmeasured regimes .",
    "assuming that we have access to a fourier representation of our observed galaxy , we _ do not need to fit the galaxy to any basis set _ to execute the roundness test .",

    "then we iterate the coordinate origin and the shear components @xmath140 until all the tests are zero .",
    "we assign the galaxy an ellipticity @xmath141 at the null .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ biases ] shows the results of applying fdnt shape measurements to the same perfectly elliptical sersic - profile galaxies measured with the gl basis - set technique .",
    "there is dramatic improvement : in nearly all cases the biases are too low to even appear on our plots .",
    "note in the lower panels of figure  [ biases ] that more elliptical galaxies have higher shape noise levels ( expressed as errors in @xmath40 ) , _ i.e. _ are less sensitive to applied shear .",
    "there is a subtle reason for this .",
    "the fdnt weight function contains a circularized mtf term @xmath137 defined in .",
    "this averaging must be done in the sheared coordinate system where we are testing for roundness .",
    "even if the psf is circular on the observed image , it will not be circular in the sheared coordinates .",
    "furthermore the function @xmath142 as defined in will change subtly as we test for roundness at different @xmath40 values .",
    "in particular , if the mtf goes to zero at some @xmath143 in the observed frame , then the function @xmath142 should go to zero at a smaller radius @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is a `` shrink factor '' given by @xmath146^{1/4}$ ] .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ psfshrink ] , shearing the coordinate system makes the psf broader in one dimension , effectively degrading resolution in this direction .",
    "but since our roundness test requires a circularly symmetric weight function , we must shrink the entire weight function to fit it into the useful region of the now - elliptical mtf . because there is now less @xmath1 space to use for the roundness tests ,",
    "the shape measurement becomes noisier .",
    "space for elliptical galaxies .",
    "we schematically draw the size of a galaxy and psf in real space , in the fourier domain , and in fourier domain after shearing the coordinates to make the galaxy appear round .",
    "it is in this last frame that we want to apply a circular `` roundness test '' weight function in order to have well - behaved shape assignments . in the bottom row",
    "we see how a more elliptical galaxy forces the shaded roundness test to be smaller ( in @xmath1 space ) if it is to remain inside the mtf where the data are not degraded . ]    rather than recompute the circularized @xmath142 via ( [ t0def ] ) at every shear being tested , we simplify by computing and tabulating a function @xmath147 defined to be @xmath142 in the observed coordinate frame ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "then for non - zero @xmath40 we just calculate the shrink factor @xmath145 and use the function @xmath148 for the psf part of the weight .",
    "a second effect of the distortion of the mtf as we change @xmath40 is that the roundness tests are _ not _ invariant under shear of the underlying galaxy .",
    "a galaxy that is sheared to become more elliptical will be nulled by a roundness test that is slightly smaller ( in @xmath1 space ) than the unsheared galaxy .",
    "this violates one of our original criteria for roundness tests and leads to potential multiplicative shear biases when the source galaxies have radial ellipticity gradients , a problem which we elaborate and solve in  [ eg ] .",
    "these problems are not specific to the fdnt method ; all practical shape measurements apply some kind of psf - dependent weighting to galaxies , and this weight will vary under shear unless we specifically design the weighting scheme to avoid this",
    ".      the fdnt measurement can be quite fast , requiring an fft of the pixelized @xmath54 into fourier domain , and the evaluation of the four weight functions at each point in the transformed image .",
    "the derivatives of the null tests with respect to centroid position are easily calculated ; we solve for the centroid position by assuming linear response to centroid shifts relative to the starting position .",
    "the search for the shear that then nulls @xmath56 and @xmath57 can use standard nonlinear root - finding techniques , in our case powell s `` dogleg '' method @xcite .",
    "if the observed image has stationary noise , then the covariance matrix of the fourier components is diagonal , and it is also very fast to propagate the image noise into a covariance matrix for the 4 null tests .",
    "it is however computationally expensive to propagate a non - uniform noise map into fourier domain , and therefore the ft method is ill - suited to estimating uncertainties on the null tests in this case .",
    "other shape - measurement methods make use of fourier - domain representations of galaxy images @xcite .",
    "it may prove difficult , however , to turn such methods into practical weak - lensing algorithms , because the fourier transform is not robust to missing pixels , _",
    "e.g. _ from cosmic rays .",
    "furthermore , galaxies have neighbors , so we have a limited region over which to perform a transform without running into neighbor galaxies , which places a limit on the @xmath1-space resolution one can obtain .",
    "zero - padding a small postage stamp can increase the resolution of the ft , but one is then assuming that the galaxy flux drops identically to zero outside the postage stamp , which may induce a bias in the shape measurement .    we need some way to interpolate in real space to missing pixels or extrapolate to large radii .",
    "we can call upon fitting methods again to do this .",
    "if we fit the _ observed _ image to a finite basis set such that @xmath149 , then in fourier domain the galaxy is @xmath150 .",
    "the roundness ( or centroid ) test @xmath151 is @xmath152 \\tilde \\psi_i({\\bf k } ) , \\\\ { \\rm cov}(t_j , t_k ) & = & \\sum_{lm } \\beta_{jl } { \\rm cov}(b_l , b_m ) \\beta_{mk}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we need fit the observed image @xmath139 just once to obtain the @xmath72 and their covariance matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ we project the pixel data onto a description @xmath72 and execute the tests on the @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath72 is of lower dimension than the pixel count , we have made the propagation of errors easier than in the ft method , and we become robust to missing pixels .    we have implemented a version of the fdnt tests which uses the elliptical gl functions as a basis set .",
    "these basis functions have the advantage of being their own fourier transforms ( up to a power of @xmath153 ) , which makes the gl basis fit a fast way of bringing the galaxy into the fourier domain .",
    "the fit is robust to missing pixels if the order of the gl decomposition is not too high , and the gl functions are compact in real ( and fourier ) space so they do not need very large postage stamps to fit successfully .",
    "the central panel of figure  [ biases ] shows the result of executing the fdnt method with fourier transforms done by the gl decomposition .",
    "we see that for sersic indices @xmath154 and @xmath111 , the gl transform induces biases that are worse than our fdnt - ft method and exceed the desired @xmath155 threshold when the source ellipticity gets high .",
    "these galaxies are of course the ones that are least compactly represented by the elliptical gl basis , and hence the execution of the fourier transform via gl decomposition leads to biases .",
    "we would find larger biases if the psf were an airy function instead of a gaussian , because it is known that the gl decomposition requires very high order to reproduce the @xmath156 cusp of the airy mtf ( nb07 ) .",
    "we have once again the situation that the use of a finite basis set to fill in missing galaxy information can lead to biases if the basis set is not well matched to the galaxies",
    ".    however we should note that the performance of the fdnt - gl method , while worse than fdnt - ft , is much better than the performance of the nb07 implementation of the basis - set fitting method .",
    "note that the biases are much smaller than for the nb07 method , and also the shear noise level remains stable when we increase the order of the gl decomposition from 12 to 16 , even for poorly resolved galaxies , and the noise levels are generally lower .",
    "the fdnt - gl method differs from basis - set - fitting in that we are fitting the _ observed _ object profile , not attempting to fit the _ pre - seeing _ image .",
    "this makes the fit more stable so we can go to higher order .",
    "we can also use a basis that is matched in size and shape to the object , making the galaxy more compact in the basis . and by using the fdnt roundness test instead of one of the basis coefficients , we make our shape measurement immune to noise that comes from attempting to fit the pre - seeing galaxy at @xmath1 values suppressed by the mtf .",
    "we are not constrained to using the gl basis set ; one can execute the fourier transform by fitting any desired basis set to the observed image .",
    "the direct ft method has the advantage of lower biases ( and faster execution ) than the gl fdnt method .",
    "however the benefit of projecting the pixel data onto a basis set before transforming is that we can compress the pixel data to a smaller number of parameters , making propagation of errors more tractable , and also making the measurement robust to missing pixels or smaller measurement apertures .",
    "vb find that a galaxy composed of a superposition of bulge and disk components with different ellipticities was measured with 2% multiplicative shear error , and that this error was not reduced by increasing the radial freedom of their circular - model - fitting method ( see their figure 7 ) .",
    "this multiplicative error is a consequence of two circumstances .",
    "first , the galaxy s measured ellipticity varies with the scale of the weight function applied to the calculation of its quadratic moments , _",
    "i.e. _ its core is rounder than its outskirts , or vice - versa in fourier space .",
    "second , the effective weight function of the circular - model - fitting method changes implicitly with the ellipticity @xmath40 being applied to the model as the mtf gets sheared in the frame where the model is circular . as discussed above",
    ", this violates the prescription that our roundness test should be invariant under applied shear .",
    "we reiterate that this implicit change in the shape weighting function under shear is present in nearly every shape - measurement methodology published to date , with the choice of weight scale often buried deep in the implementation details .",
    "the resultant biases are probably endemic to current shape measurements . here",
    "we investigate the problem and its solution in more detail within the context of the fdnt method .",
    "consider an unlensed , pre - seeing galaxy that when measured with a null test of scale @xmath145 yields an ellipticity @xmath157 .",
    "if the galaxy is not perfectly elliptical , it may have nonzero derivatives @xmath158 and @xmath159 with respect to a change in the weight scale factor .",
    "we will say that such a galaxy has `` ellipticity gradients '' even though its isophotes need not be ellipses .",

    "we show that shape biases can be generated when fitting with the basis sets are ( necessarily ) truncated to finite size or with perfectly elliptical galaxy models .",
    "a multiplicative shear bias will typically occur when the radial profile of the galaxy is not well matched by the finite basis set .",

    "if the `` roundness test '' being applied to the pre - seeing image extends to regions of @xmath1 space that have been highly or fully suppressed by the mtf of the image , then any attempt to fully eliminate the bias will cause the noise in the shape determination to diverge .",
    "this will occur whenever one is trying to use a basis set that is size - matched to a pre - seeing galaxy image that is smaller than the psf .",
    "we propose a new shape measurement , `` fourier - domain null tests '' ( fdnt ) , which constructs linear functions of the galaxy s fourier representation that are explicitly designed to maintain bounded noise in the presence of an mtf , and which are pure dipole and quadrupole functions of the pre - seeing galaxy intensity pattern . following the bj02 and nb07 prescriptions for `` geometric '' shape measurements ,",
    "the centroid and shear of the fdnt functions are varied until the tests are nulled , and the galaxy is assigned a shape according to the shear that nulled the tests .",

    "this one occurs when the measured ellipticity of the underlying galaxy varies with the scale of weight function applied by the measurement .",
    "when we measure the shape of such an `` ellipticity gradient '' galaxy we must be sure that the weighting function stays fixed if the galaxy is sheared . in forward - fitting shape measurement methods ,",
    "the effective weighting function arises implicitly from a combination of the fitted galaxy model , the noise distribution , and the psf .",
    "this implicit function _ does _ typically change as a galaxy is distorted , inducing a shear measurement bias .",
    "since our fdnt method controls the weighting function explicitly , we can determine and correct the ellipticity gradient effect on shear measurement .",

    "since the @xmath191 correction are smaller to start with , they do not need to be determined to as high relative accuracy as the ksb polarizabilities .",
    "we have investigated an idealized case in this paper , with well - sampled images having no missing pixels , no crowding , uniform white noise , gaussian psfs , and very high @xmath3 on a single image . even in this case",
    "we note that obtaining @xmath230 multiplicative errors requires great care , _",
    "e.g. _ the use of nonlinear shear responsivities as described in the appendix , and knowledge of the psf to very high accuracy . in a future paper",
    "we will extend the fdnt method to finite noise .",
    "we note that extension of the fdnt method to measurement of a galaxy imaged in multiple exposures is straightforward ",
    "one simply creates a null test that is the @xmath3-weighted sum of the null tests for the individual exposures .",
    "we iterate the common centroid and shape of these tests until the summed test is nulled .",
    "each exposure can have its own psf , and unlike fitting methods , we need not even assume that the galaxy has the same underlying appearance in each exposure .",
    "so fdnt is easily applied to the full collection of multicolor images collected for a single galaxy .",
