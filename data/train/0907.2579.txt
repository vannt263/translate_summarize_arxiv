    "the only known method today to apply qcd in a rigorous way is based on the factorization of the dynamics and the isolation of a short - distance part that becomes this way accessible to perturbative techniques of quantum field theory ( see , @xcite and for a review , for instance , @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "then , the conventional systematic way of dealing with the long - distance part is to parameterize it in terms of matrix elements of quark and gluon operators between hadronic states ( or the vacuum ) .",
    "these matrix elements stem from nonperturbative phenomena and have to be either extracted from experiment or be determined on the lattice . in many phenomenological applications they are usually modeled in terms of various nonperturbative methods or models .",
    "generically , the application of qcd to hadronic processes involves the consideration of hard parton subprocesses and ( unknown ) nonperturbative functions to describe binding effects .",
    "prominent examples are hard exclusive hadronic processes which involve hadron distribution amplitudes ( das ) , generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) , and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite . applying such a framework , collisions of a real and a highly - virtual photon provide a useful tool for studying a variety of fundamental aspects of qcd .",
    "recently , nonperturbative quantities of a new kind were introduced ",
    "transition distribution amplitudes ( tdas ) @xcite  which are closely related to the gpds .",
    "in contrast to the gdas , the tdas appear in the factorization procedure when the mandelstam variable @xmath3 is of the same order of magnitude as the large photon virtuality @xmath4 , while @xmath5 is rather small .",
    "remarkably , there exists a reaction where both amplitude types , gdas and tdas , can overlap .",
    "this can happen in the fusion of a real and transversely polarized photon with a highly - virtual longitudinally polarized photon , giving rise to a final state which comprises a pair of pions .",
    "the key feature of this reaction is that it can potentially follow either path : proceed via twist-@xmath2 gdas , or go through the leading - twist tdas , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gdavstda ] .",
    "such an antagonism of alternative factorization mechanisms in this reaction seems extremely interesting both theoretically and phenomenologically and deserves to be studied in detail .",
    "the intimate relation between these two mechanisms in the production of a vector - meson pair was analyzed in @xcite and it was found that these mechanisms can be selected by means of the different polarizations of the initial - state photon .",
    "in contrast , for ( pseudo)scalar particles , such as the pions , this effect is absent enabling us to access the overlap region of both mechanisms and their duality as opposed to their additivity .    in this talk , we will report on the possibility for duality between these antagonistic mechanisms of factorization , associated either with gdas or with tdas , in the regime where _ both _ mandelstam variables @xmath3 and @xmath5 are rather small compared to the large photon virtuality @xmath4 .",
    "consider first the factorization of the scalar @xmath0 model in euclidean space . to study the four - particle amplitude in detail ,",
    "it is particularly useful to employ the @xmath6-representation  see @xcite . then , the contribution of the leading `` box '' diagram can be written as ( while details can be found in @xcite ) @xmath7,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 serves as a infrared ( ir ) regulator , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the mandelstam variables in the euclidean region , and @xmath11 . assuming that @xmath12 is large compared to the mass scale @xmath8 ( which simulates here the typical scale of soft interactions )",
    ", the amplitude ( [ amp1 ] ) can indeed be factorized .",
    "as regards the other two kinematic variables @xmath3 and @xmath5 , one can identify three distinct regimes of factorization : ( a ) @xmath13 while @xmath5 is of order @xmath4 ; ( b ) @xmath14 while @xmath3 is of order @xmath4 ; ( c ) @xmath15 .",
    "* regime ( a ) * : the process is going through the s - channel . in this regime , the main contribution in the integral in eq .  ( [ amp1 ] ) arises from the integration over @xmath16 when @xmath17 : @xmath18^{-1}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] schematically this means that the propagator , parameterized by @xmath16 , can be associated with the partonic ( hard ) subprocesses , while the remaining propagator constitutes the soft part of the considered amplitude , i.e. , the scalar version of the gda .",
    "* regime ( b ) * : here we have to eliminate from the exponential in eq .  ( [ amp1 ] ) the variables @xmath4 and @xmath3 , which are large .",
    "this can be achieved by integrating over the region @xmath19 . performing similar manipulations as in regime ( a ) , we find that the scalar tda amplitude can be related to the scalar gda via @xmath20 .",
    "* regime ( c ) * : the relevant regime to investigate duality is when it happens that both variables @xmath3 and @xmath5 are simultaneously small compared to @xmath4 , i.e. , when @xmath21 . in this case , there are two possibilities to extract the leading @xmath4-asymptotics , notably , we can either integrate over the region @xmath22 , or integrate instead over the region @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , these two options can be associated with ( i ) the gda mechanism of factorization with the meson pair scattered at a small angle in its center - of - mass system or , alternatively , ( ii ) with the tda mechanism of factorization .",
    "we stress that we may face double counting when naively adding these two contributions .",
    "we interpret such a behavior as a signal of an ingrained tendency for duality between the gda(s - channel ) and the tda ( t - channel ) factorization mechanisms .    in order to verify the appearance of duality",
    "we carry out a numerical investigation of the exact and the asymptotic amplitudes . in doing so , we introduce the following ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 .     and @xmath26 as functions of @xmath27.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    appealing to the symmetry of these ratios under the exchange of the variables @xmath28 , we take @xmath29 to be @xmath30 and look for the variation of the ratios with @xmath27 .",
    "this variation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - rat-1 ] from which one sees that in the region where @xmath27 is rather small , i.e. , in the range @xmath31 , both asymptotic formulae are describing the exact amplitude with an accuracy of more than @xmath32 .",
    "this behavior supports the conclusion that , when both mandelstam variables @xmath27 and @xmath29 assume values in the wide interval @xmath33 , duality between the tda and the gda factorization mechanisms emerges .",
    "having discussed the appearance of duality between the gda and the tda factorization schemes within a toy model , we now turn attention to real qcd . to analyze duality , we consider the exclusive @xmath35 production in a @xmath36 collision , where the virtual photon with a large virtuality @xmath4 is longitudinally polarized , whereas the other one is quasi real and transversely polarized .",
    "notice that the gda and the tda regimes correspond to the _ same _ helicity amplitudes .",
    "given that the considered process involves a longitudinally and a transversally polarized photon , we are actually dealing with twist-3 gdas @xcite . on the other hand , for the twist-2 contribution , related to the meson da ,",
    "we use the standard parametrization of the @xmath37-to - vacuum matrix element which involves a bilocal axial - vector quark operator @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath38 axial - vector matrix elements can be parameterized in the form , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xmath39\\psi(z/2 )     |\\gamma(q^\\prime , \\varepsilon^\\prime )     \\rangle \\stackrel{{\\cal f}}{= }     \\frac{e}{f_\\pi}\\varepsilon^\\prime_t     \\cdot\\delta_t p_\\alpha a_1(x,\\xi , t)\\ , , \\label{eq : gpimea}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , and noticing that the symbol @xmath42 means fourier transformation and that the vector matrix element does not contribute here . to normalize the axial - vector tda , @xmath43",
    ", we express it in terms of the axial - vector form factor measured in the weak decay @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the helicity amplitude associated with the tda mechanism reads @xmath45 with @xmath46\\frac{c_f}{2\\,n_c }     \\biggl ( { \\rm tw-}2 \\,\\,\\ , { \\rm da}\\biggr )     \\biggl ( { \\rm tw-}2 \\,\\,\\ , { \\rm tda}\\biggr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 employing the 1-loop @xmath48 in the @xmath49-scheme with @xmath50  gev for @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "[ note that there is only a mild dependence on @xmath52 . ]    turning now to the helicity amplitude , which includes the twist-@xmath2 gda , we anticipate that it can be written as ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath53 with @xmath54 where @xmath55 with the partial derivative being defined by @xmath56 . in deriving ( [ gdahelam ] ) ,",
    "we have used for the twist-@xmath2 contribution the wandzura - wilczek approximation .",
    "duality between expressions ( [ tdahelam ] ) and ( [ gdahelam ] ) may occur in that regime , where both variables @xmath3 and @xmath5 are simultaneously much smaller in comparison to the large photon virtuality @xmath4 .",
    "more insight into the relative weight of the amplitudes with tda or gda contributions can be gained once we have modeled these non - perturbative quantities .",
    "we commence our analysis with the tdas and , assuming a factorizing ansatz for the @xmath5-dependence of the tdas , we write @xmath57 , where the @xmath5-independent function @xmath58 is normalized to unity . to satisfy the unity - normalization condition",
    ", we introduce a tda defined by @xmath59 and continue with the discussion of the @xmath5-independent tdas . recalling that we are mainly interested in tdas in the region @xmath60 @xcite , it is useful to adopt the following parametrization @xmath61 where @xmath62 are free adjustable parameters , encoding nonperturbative input , and the standard notations for gegenbauer polynomials are used .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the tda expressed by eq .",

    "we close this section by summarizing our numerical analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "we calculated both functions @xmath76 and @xmath72 , and show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig - tda - gda1 ] .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the function @xmath76 , where we have adjusted the free parameters to @xmath77 .",
    "the results , obtained for rather small values of these parameters , are displayed by the broken lines in the same figure .",
    "the dotted line denotes the function @xmath76 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , whereas the dashed - dotted line employs @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for comparison",
    ", we also include the results for @xmath72 . in that latter case",

    "( 20 ) of @xcite , while the solid line represents the simplest ansatz for @xmath82 with @xmath83 . from this figure",
    "one may infer that when the parameter @xmath82 , which parameterizes the gda contribution , is estimated with the aid of the breit - wigner formula ( provided @xmath84 ) , there is duality between the gda and the tda factorization mechanisms .",
    "hence , the model for @xmath75 , which takes into account the corresponding resonances , can be selected by duality .",
    "we have provided evidence that when both mandelstam variables @xmath3 and @xmath5 turn out to be much less than the large momentum scale @xmath4 , with the variables @xmath27 and @xmath29 varying in the interval @xmath85 $ ] , the tda and the gda factorization mechanisms are equivalent to each other and operate in parallel .",
    "we have also demonstrated that duality may serve as a tool for selecting suitable models for the nonperturbative ingredients of various exclusive amplitudes entering qcd factorization . in this context , we observed that twist-3 gdas appear to be dual to the convolutions of leading - twist tdas and das , multiplied by a qcd effective coupling .",
