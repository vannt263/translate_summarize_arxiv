    "a reliable description of the dynamics of fermi - systems is commonly achieved in the quasiclassical ( qc ) limit , which is based on the concept of a classical particle moving in the mean field and along a classical trajectory between successive instantaneous collisions .",
    "the qc picture assumes a hierarchy of time - scales ; the time - scales on which the renormalization of the excitation spectra and collisions occur are expected to be smaller than the mean time - scale between encounters of dressed quasiparticles .",
    "a similar assumption applies to the length - scales .",
    "as well known , such a separation is possible in the limiting cases of a classical dilute gas and a highly degenerate fermi - liquid ( for a review see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical information in quasiclassical approximation ( qca ) is contained in the single particle distribution function ; the higher order distributions ( determined form the bgkky hierarchy ) appear as time - dependent functionals of single particle distribution ( for a review see , e.g. ,  @xcite )",
    ". a second element of kinetic description of fermi - systems is the quasiparticle approximation ( qpa ) , which assumes a sharp functional dependence of the energies of the quasiparticles on their momenta .",
    "the qpa is sufficient to constrain the time - scale ( but not the length - scale ) hierarchy to the qc limit ; it does not , however , appear to be a necessary condition .",
    "the need of extension of kinetic description of fermi - systems beyond qpa arises in a number of physical situations .",
    "an example is the excited nuclear matter produced in heavy - ion collision experiments at energies @xmath0  mev / nucleon ( for a review see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the expanding nuclear system traverses a broad region in the density - temperature plane and , in particular , the temperature could be of order the fermi temperature . in such situations",
    "the spectral function of the single particle excitations acquires a finite width .",
    "if the half - width of the spectral function is small compared with the amplitude , the corrections to the qp picture are small , and the hierarchy of the time - scale still holds ( in other words , a distinction can be made between the renormalization effect leading to the broading of the qp peak and the elementary collision events between the single particle excitations with renormalized spectra ) .",
    "the finite width of the spectral function introduces in the system correlations _ beyond _ the renormalization of the single particle spectrum , which lead to the so - called virial corrections , and in particular to formation of bound states ( in nuclear collisions - deuterons  @xcite , tritons , alpha particles , etc . ) and",
    "off - mass - shell propagation ( such as landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect in the particle radiation processes  @xcite ) .",
    "situation , similar to the one described above , is encountered also in the astrophysical context ; e.g. in the finite temperature isospin asymmetical nuclear matter in the supernova collapse and proto - neutron stars .",
    "the picture above suggests seeking a kinetic equation for fermi - systems that accommodates the separation of the time and length - scales ( and hence the qc approximation ) while allowing for effects beyond the qpa .",
    "[ formally this means that the time - scales of variation of the self - energy functions ( providing the renormalization and transport vertex ) are small compared to the evolution time - scales for the propagators related to the quasiparticle distribution function ] .",
    "initial studies of the virial corrections to the boltzmann equation were carried out using the density matrix approach  @xcite ; progress in this direction is represented by snyder s kinetic equation  @xcite , where bogoliubov s ansatz of the weakening of the initial correlations is used to close the bgkky hierarchy at the two - particle level .",
    "the partition of the virial corrections between the collision integral and the drift term is not unambiguous  @xcite , however the kinetic equation reproduces the correct form of the lowest order ( second ) virial coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the formation of the bound states and three - body processes within the density matrix approach has been considered e.g. by mclennan  @xcite , klimontovich et al  @xcite and rpke and schulz  @xcite , who derive coupled kinetic equations for a gas viewed as a reacting mixture of atoms and diatomic molecules or nucleons and their bound states ( the authors do not consider the third virial coefficient , however ) .",
    "the transport theory , which is based on the real - time green s functions formalism and is largely due to kadanoff and baym  @xcite and keldysh  @xcite , provides an alternative to the density matrix approach , and allows systematic diagrammatic approximations to the propagators and self - energies . the reduction scheme for the double - time integro - differential kadanoff - baym equations for the green s functions to a single - time boltzmann - type kinetic uses the qca , which , as discussed above , separates the time and length - scales associated with individual collisions from those characterizing the inter - collision dynamics , and the qpa , which assumes a delta - shaped spectral function .",
    "the form and further approximations for the scattering - in and -out rates , represented by the feynman diagrams of elementary scattering processes , vary considerably depending on the specifics of the dynamics and composition of the underlying system ; cf . , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the quantum kinetics beyond qpa has been addressed in a number of recent works  @xcite .",
    "the memory effects in the non - markovian kinetic equations , as shown in  @xcite , provide a sufficiently general description of correlations in quantum systems ; the second order virial corrections emerge when the time - retarded spectral function is expanded to the next - to - leading order in retardation .",
    "this form of second - order quantum virial correction agrees with the equilibrium result derived for semiconductors  @xcite , coulomb plasmas  @xcite and finite temperature nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the second order virial corrections in the local - time description and for the electron - impurity system have been given in  @xcite in terms of the next - to - leading order expansion of the spectral function with respect to the width  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the three - body problem for an isolated system is well know , and is represented by the faddeev  @xcite or ags  @xcite equations .",
    "the kadanoff - baym formalism has been applied to derive kinetic equations including triple collisions by bezzerides and dubois  @xcite ; their study , however , has been restricted mainly to the born approximation , and consequently the collision integrals contain singularities due to the non - fredholm type kernels of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "a different motivation for studying the three - body equations comes from the problem of the imaginary nuclear potentials , where the 2-particle - hole channel dominates ground state correlations in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a self - consistent random phase approximation to the respective three - body problem at zero - temperature has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the the finite temperature discussion of the latter problem is contained in refs .",
    "@xcite as an example of the application of the cutting rules for the multi - contour ordered green s functions due to danielewicz  @xcite . in the near - equilibrium situation",
    "the nucleon - deuteron system has been studied at finite temperatures in the ags formulation in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the progress mentioned above , the subject of the kinetics with three - body correlations needs further attention since ( i )  one would like to arrive at a kinetic equation which in the equilibrium limit leads to third order quantum virial corrections to the equation of state , ( ii )  the three - body collision processes should be free of singularities , therefore the appropriate faddeev or ags amplitudes should be used in the collision integrals ( see also  @xcite ) ; ( iii )  the scattering amplitudes in the medium should reduce to the three - body faddeev equations which are exact in the vacuum limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address these items and to provide a link between the kinetic description beyond the qpa and three - body correlations .",
    "we adopt the familiar methodology of next - to - leading order expansion of the spectral function with respect to the spectral width , however instead of the decomposition of green s functions into pole and off - pole terms  @xcite , we use a decomposition in powers of the width . in the introduction to section 2",
    "we discuss the double - time kinetic equation and the gradient approximation to this equation ( readers familiar with the formalism may skip this part of the section ; the notation is as in kadanoff and baym  @xcite ) .",
