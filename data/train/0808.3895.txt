    "high angular resolution observations of molecular gas have revealed the presence of dense equatorial discs and tori towards several late asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and young planetary nebulae ( pne ) : for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the post - agb wind and such equatorial structures has been proposed as one of the possible physical mechanisms in shaping the bipolar and multipolar morphologies seen in pne and proto - pne ( ppne ) @xcite .",
    "the origin of molecular discs and tori around late agb stars is not completely clear , but a possible explanation is the presence of a binary system @xcite . in this case , when one of the stars enters the agb phase , some of the ejected material can be retained , generating an extended torus .",
    "however , in the case of the high velocity jets observed in some late agb stars , post - agb stars , and young pne @xcite it is believed that a more effective collimation mechanism(s ) should be present in the innermost region of the object , such as an accretion disc @xcite or a stellar magnetic field produced by a rotating star @xcite . furthermore",
    ", recent observations reveal compelling evidence for magnetic fields in post - agb stars and pne , associated with equatorial discs and/or jets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the process for the formation of accretion discs in ppne has been investigated in detail by @xcite .",
    "they find that a disc forms when a close binary system ( with a substellar companion ) undergoes common envelope evolution .",
    "for the case in which a low - mass secondary is disrupted during a dynamically unstable mass transfer process , an accretion disc , with a radius of @xmath310  au and a mass of @xmath32@xmath4  m@xmath5 , forms within @xmath3100  yr .",
    "recently , @xcite from their 3d simulations based on a two - wind model with a warped disc , suggested that , in order to explain the observed multipolar and point - symmetric shape of pne , the required discs are quite small ( @xmath310100  au ) .",
    "furthermore , these disc - like structures should be dense ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) and in keplerian rotation .",
    "interferometric co observations show larger toroidal molecular structures with sizes in the range of @xmath010006000 au in ppne and young pne .",
    "these structures seem to be systematically in expansion with a mean velocity of @xmath37  km  s@xmath2 , such as in m  1 - 92 @xcite , m  2 - 9 @xcite , @xcite , or kjpn  8 @xcite .",
    "these velocities are comparable to or below those found in expanding agb envelopes @xcite .",
    "importantly , rotation has been observed in the red rectangle as well as slower expansion ( @xmath30.8  km  s@xmath2 ) , superimposed on rotation , according to @xcite .",
    "note that the sizes of the tori are about one or two orders of magnitude more than the sizes of the disc - like structures proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "maps of water maser emission allow the identification of a disc - like structure with a radius of 012 in iras 17347 - 3139 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath0100750  au at the source distance @xcite . in this case",
    ", the gas kinematics suggests the presence of both rotation and expansion in the disc traced by the water masers . in this context",
    ", it is very important to study in detail the kinematics of much smaller disc - like structures that might be related to the collimation of the observed bipolar outflows in some pne .",
    "k3 - 35 is a young pn that shows a bipolar outflow in optical images @xcite . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "k3 - 35 exhibits a bright core and two bipolar lobes with an s - shape @xcite .",
    "the distance to this object has been estimated to be @xmath35  kpc @xcite , using an statistical method .",
    "however , we note the large uncertainty of this type of estimate , since the application of different statistical methods could give distances varying by factors of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic s - shape morphology of the radio lobes can be successfully reproduced by a precessing jet evolving in a dense circumstellar medium @xcite .",
    "water maser emission has been found in three regions : two regions located at the tips of the bipolar radio jet about @xmath01@xmath8 from the centre ( regions",
    "n and s ) , and another region towards the core of the nebula within @xmath0002 ( region c ) , suggesting the presence of a torus @xcite .",
    "in addition , oh maser emission has been detected towards the centre of k3 - 35 ( within @xmath0004 ) , showing circular polarisation that suggests the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we decided to study the spatio - kinematical distribution of the water masers reported by @xcite towards the centre of k3 - 35 in order to identify possible expansion and/or rotation motions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a simple kinematical model of a ring including both expansion and rotation , and we calculate the pattern delineated in the position - velocity diagrams . we also describe the least - squares fit procedure that we used . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the current observational data of h@xmath9o masers in the pn k3 - 35 .",
    "we then apply our model to the h@xmath9o masers located towards the centre of the pn k3 - 35 , making a comparison between the results and the observations .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "we assume a narrow , uniform , rotating , and expanding ring of radius @xmath10 , arbitrarily oriented with respect to the line of sight .",
    "its projection on the plane of the sky is an ellipse with semimajor and semiminor axes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "we define the two frames of reference shown in fig .  1 .",
    "both coincide with the plane of the sky , one of them has its origin at the centre of the ellipse and is oriented such that the @xmath13-axis is along the major axis of the projected ellipse , and the other one has the axes parallel to the ra and dec axes .",
    "the semimajor and semiminor axes are related to the ring radius by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the inclination angle between the line of sight and the normal to the ring plane as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the equation of the ellipse is given by @xmath17 and the transformation equations between the coordinate systems are @xmath18 @xmath19 where ( @xmath20 ) is the position of the centre of the ellipse , and @xmath21 is the angle between the @xmath22-axes of the two frames of reference , and is defined as positive clockwise .",
    "the angle @xmath21 is related to the position angle ( pa ) of the major axis of the ellipse by @xmath23 .    - and the @xmath24-coordinate systems are in the plane of the sky .",
    "the @xmath25-system has its origin at the centre of the ellipse ( @xmath26 ) , and @xmath21 is the angle between the @xmath22-axis and the @xmath13-axis .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath27 axes are parallel to the ra and dec axes.,width=272 ]        let @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 be the local standard of rest ( lsr ) systemic velocity , the rotation velocity , and the expansion velocity of the ring , respectively . then the observed lsr velocity of a point in the ring can be expressed as @xmath31 hence the observed @xmath32 will be a linear function of either @xmath13 or @xmath33 , if only one type of motion ( rotation or expansion , respectively ) is present in the ring @xcite . using equation ( 1 ) , equation ( 4 )",
    "can be written either in terms of the @xmath13 or @xmath33 coordinate as @xmath34 ^ 2}{(v_{\\rmn{exp}}\\sin i)^2}+\\frac{x'^2}{a^2}=1,\\ ] ] @xmath35 ^ 2}{(v_{\\rmn{rot}}\\sin i)^2}+\\frac{y'^2}{(a\\cos i)^2}=1.\\ ] ] therefore , equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) indicate that the observed @xmath32 has a quadratic form ( ellipse ) expressed in terms of @xmath13 or @xmath33 , when both motions are present .    in this model , we do not solve the radiative transfer through the ring , but we assume that the emission at a given @xmath32 comes from the point of the ring having this line - of - sight velocity component .",
    "we then use this information to construct position - velocity diagrams .",
    "the orientation of the major axis of the ellipse in the position - velocity ( @xmath13-@xmath32 or @xmath33-@xmath32 ) diagrams changes depending on the value of the inclination angle and on whether the sense of rotation is clockwise or counterclockwise as seen from the observer s point of view , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "accordingly , we are able to distinguish between a positive or negative value of the inclination angle and the sense of the rotation by doing a comparison between the position - velocity diagram delineated by the maser emission and the position - velocity diagrams expected for a rotating and expanding ring .",
    "it is important to note that similar position - velocity diagrams can be obtained considering contraction instead of expansion in the ring , but changing the sign of the inclination angle and the sense of rotation",
    ". this ambiguity can be solved by constraining the value of the inclination angle ( positive or negative ) with additional information ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "we carried out a least - squares fit of an ellipse to the observed emission , to estimate its spatial distribution on the sky . in order to do this",
    ", we considered the curve on the @xmath24-plane given by equations ( 1)(3 ) for a given set of values of the parameters @xmath36 ( the centre of the ellipse on the plane of the sky ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the semimajor and semiminor axes , respectively ) and @xmath21 ( the angle between the @xmath22-axes of the two frames of reference ) .",
    "we then compute the minimum distances @xmath37 between the position @xmath38 of each of the masers and the ellipse ( these distances are measured along straight lines that pass through the maser and intersect the ellipse at right angles to the curve ) .",
    "with these distances , we define the @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of data points ( i.e. the factor @xmath42 is the number of degrees of freedom ) , and @xmath43 is the error associated with the position of the maser spots .",
    "we then find the set of parameters @xmath44 ( see above ) which give the minimum of @xmath39 .    as a first approximation",
    ", we began by setting the values of @xmath43 equal to the observational uncertainties @xmath45 for the measured positions of the masers , and then finding the ellipse that gives the minimum value of @xmath46 ( see equation [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "the actual structure of the maser - emitting region could be a ring of finite width , for which a broad ellipse is a rough approximation of its projection on the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , we do not expect maser spots to exactly trace an ellipse .",
    "we can characterise the width of the ring , assuming that the fitted ellipse traces the mean projected angular distance of the maser emission to the central star , and the actual emission will be distributed around this ellipse , with a dispersion @xmath47 .",
    "we treat @xmath47 as a source of error for the ellipse fit , additional to the measured error , so that @xmath48 .",
    "we then try different values of the width parameter ( @xmath47 ) , until we obtain a fit with a minimum @xmath49 .",
    "we consider @xmath50 as the characteristic width of the maser ring .",
    "the @xmath44 parameters obtained from the minimization of @xmath46 give the best elliptical fit to the observed positions of the masers .",
    "with these spatial parameters , we carried out a kinematical fit , using the lsr velocities of the maser components in order to define a @xmath51 of the form @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of degrees of freedom , and @xmath55 are given by equations ( 2)(3 ) . here",
    "@xmath56 is the uncertainty in the observed lsr velocity that we adopt as the spectral resolution of the observations .",
    "the minimization of @xmath51 yielded the best values for the systemic ( @xmath28 ) , rotation ( @xmath29 ) , and expansion ( @xmath30 ) velocities .",

    "+ @xmath59 coordinates of the centre of the ellipse relative to the position of the 1.3  cm continuum emission peak .    in the case of k3 - 35",
    ", the water masers may be delineating an ellipse on the plane of the sky with a semimajor axis of @xmath0100 au and a pa@xmath0158@xmath6010 , suggesting the presence of a disc or torus projected on the sky .",
    "the major axis of the ellipse is almost perpendicular ( within the uncertainties ) to the direction of the bipolar emission traced by the innermost region of the jet , with a pa@xmath065observed by @xcite , suggesting that the disc or torus could be physically related to the collimation of the bipolar outflow .",
    "recently , @xcite found that jets typically appear a few hundred years after the torus formation in ppne and young pne .",
    "this time sequence provides evidence that jets and tori are physically related . in the case of k3 - 35 ,",
    "@xcite modelled its radio continuum emission as a precessing dense jet with an age of @xmath340  yrs . on the other hand ,",
    "our estimate of the dynamical age of the ring traced by the maser emission is about @xmath3350 years , using its radius ( @xmath3100  au ) and assuming a uniform expansion velocity of @xmath31.4  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these values would , in principle , suggest a lag in time similar to the value found by @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical age we derive is not reliable enough as an age estimate .",
    "proper motion studies of the water maser emission ( e.g. using e - merlin and vlba ) could provide better estimates .",
    "the kinematics of the ring in k3 - 35 suggests the presence of both expansion and rotation .",
    "a rough estimate for the central stellar mass can be obtained by assuming that the total energy ( kinetic plus gravitational ) of the masing gas is close to zero . in this case ,",
    "@xmath61 , where @xmath62  au , is the radius of the ring .",
    "hence , @xmath63~\\rmn{m}_{\\sun}$ ] , where @xmath64 is the source distance .",
    "the error in the mass only includes the errors in the fitted parameters .",
    "this estimate of the central mass is in agreement with the core mass required for a pne , according to evolutionary models @xcite .",
