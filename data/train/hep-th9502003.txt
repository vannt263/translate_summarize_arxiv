    "the concept of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry with the attendant goldstone phenomenon of massless scalar excitations has deeply influenced many developments in field theory and statistical physics .",
    "the existence of massless modes can already be demonstrated in landau - ginzberg mean field analysis ( or tree level , in the field theory jargon ) .",
    "however , it is not sufficient to stop at this level .",
    "precisely because they are massless , the quantum / statistical fluctuations of the goldstone bosons may significantly alter the conclusions drawn from mean field theory.proofs of the goldstone theorem @xcite in quantum field theory have traditionally been used only to establish the existence of massless poles coupling to the currents of broken symmetry .",
    "they have not usually focussed on the correlation functions .",
    "most of the applications in quantum field theory have been based on the understanding at tree level .",
    "notable exceptions are the soft pion theorems @xcite combining pcac with current algebra.these are mostly applied to extract the leading infrared behaviour .",
    "a general analysis of these issues based essentially only on symmetry arguments was given some time ago by weinberg @xcite .",
    "in that article he also proposed methods to go beyond the leading order results .",
    "he also applied renormalization group methods to understand some universal features of these results . quite recently , some of weinberg s ideas have been extensively used in the context of the so called `` chiral perturbation theory''@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in statistical physics , powerful techniques have been developed for handling the fluctuations in this context .",
    "these are of importance for quantum field theory also.some examples are : i)the finite temperature chiral symmetry restoring transition in qcd , where goldstone phenomenon in three eucilidean dimensions is of relevance @xcite ; ii)qcd at temperatures below the chiral transition temperature as well as zero temperature qcd , where goldstone phenomenon in 4 euclidean dimensions is of relevance , and iii)the problems that are handled by chiral perturbation theory at present , i.e. effects of pion loops on various processes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we point out various complimentary concepts and techniques for handling the effects due to quantum fluctuations of goldstone bosons .",
    "we develop techniques for computing correlation functions away from the infrared regime.we show that there are certain universal features , valid even in four space - time dimensions.our approach provides an alternate procedure for chiral perturbation theory which is closer in its spirit to what has been proposed by weinberg on the basis of rg equations .",
    "this aspect is elaborated upon in section 7 .",
    "often the paradigm in quantum field theory is what is seen from a tree level analysis of the o(n ) linear and non - linear @xmath3-models .",
    "the linear @xmath3-model is given by the action @xcite , @xmath5 @xmath6 transforms as the fundamental representation of o(n ) . if @xmath7 , the minimum of the classical potential is at @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the vev @xmath9 is no longer zero in a tree level analysis.choosing the vacuum @xmath10 , among the equivalent vacua , we get ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 .",
    "therefore at tree level , we have @xmath13 massless pions and a massive @xmath3 with a mass @xmath14 .    precisely because the goldstone bosons are massless , loop corrections",
    "may drastically alter the above picture .",
    "now it is well known that infrared divergences due to massless fluctuations drastically alter the conclusions of a semi - classical analysis , especially if the spacetime dimension d is less than four @xcite.already , way back in 1940 , holstein and primakoff @xcite argued that not only the transverse mode ( i.e. @xmath15 ) but also the longitudinal mode ( @xmath3 ) is soft in a quantum ferromagnet in three dimensions .",
    "their arguments can be understood , as follows , in terms of the non - linear @xmath3 -model .",
    "the non - linear @xmath3- model is relevant to the infrared dynamics of goldstone bosons @xcite .a simple heuristic argument is that if @xmath3 is massive , then for the study of the infrared dynamics of the pions , we may use an effective lagrangian obtained by integrating over the heavy @xmath3 degree of freedom .",
    "also for leading infrared behaviour we may retain only the lowest ( two ) derivative terms in the effective action.the result is simply the heisenberg model ,    @xmath16    with the constraint , @xmath17 .",
    "statistical physics in d space dimensions is simply the euclidean quantum field theory in @xmath18 space - time dimensions . in statistical physics",
    "@xmath19 is proportional to the temperature , whereas in quantum field theory it is related to the pion decay constant , @xmath20(in what follows , we set @xmath21 ) .",
    "if the spins are ordered in the direction of @xmath22 , then eliminating this field using the constraint , the action can be written entirely in terms of @xmath23 .",
    "they describe the spin waves or the transverse fluctuations.at the tree level for the @xmath15 propagator we get ,    @xmath24    we may also consider the correlations for longitudinal fluctuations i.e. of the field @xmath25 ( : refers to any ordering prescription that makes products of fields at the same point meaningful ) .",
    "this means , @xmath26 .",
    "we may expect the leading infrared behaviour to come from the first term .",
    "this would mean that so far as the leading infrared behaviour is concerned , @xcite , @xcite @xmath27 .",
    "if we ignore self - interactions of @xmath28 , and use the above propagator for @xmath28 we get , for the @xmath3 propagator ,    @xmath29    this gives , atleast for @xmath30,in momentum space , @xmath31 ignoring the self interactions of @xmath15 s will later be seen to be justified because these are soft in the infrared region a consequence of the soft pion theorems.the result is that in @xmath32 the @xmath3propagator is @xmath33 , to be contrasted with the @xmath15-propagator.this means that @xmath3 also has long range correlations .",
    "this appears to negate the naive deduction of the non - linear @xmath3 model obtained by integrating over the heavy @xmath3 field in the linear @xmath3 model @xcite .",
    "one could dismiss these results as artifacts of a 1-loop calculation .",
    "in fact the infrared divergences grow with the loop order .",
    "therefore it is imperative to tackle this issue in a framework that transcends loop expansion.there is an exactly solvable model , the berlin - kac model @xcite which goes beyond loop - expansion and again gives precisely the same diverging longitudinal susceptibility and also a massless @xmath3 in @xmath30 .",
    "again it is not clear whether this is an artifact of the model .    in order to get a handle on the infrared dynamics of the @xmath3 field , pokrovsky and patashinky @xcite proposed a `` conserved modulus principle '' ( cmp).this principle holds that the fluctuations are such as to maintain the modulus of the n- component order parameter . in mathematical terms cmp",
    "states that + @xmath34 now the expectation value of @xmath35 is given by the ornstein- zernike form : @xmath36 it is convenient to use susceptibility to describe the infrared behaviour.the longitudinal and the transverse susceptibility in presence of an external magnetic field @xmath37 are given by ,    @xmath38    using eqns .",
    "[ pp1 ] and [ pp2 ] , we get , for @xmath30 ,    @xmath39    thus the longitudinal suceptibility also diverges .",
    "patashinsky and pokrovski have offered a proof for cmp in @xcite .",
    "they express the change in the thermodynamic potential u computed to quartic order in the fluctuations as + @xmath40\\ ] ] and interpret this as implying cmp .",
    "though to quartic order the correct form of this variation , which differs from the one given above ( and which can be verified using the ward identities discussed later ) , is @xmath41 + { 1\\over 2 \\chi_{l}}[{(\\delta \\vec\\phi^2)^2\\over 4 \\bar \\phi^2}]\\ ] ] the fact that cmp is equivalent to the correct statement that the extreme ir behaviour is governed by the non - linear @xmath3-model indicates the possibility of a better proof of cmp .",
    "+ the new era for understanding the role of fluctuations of goldstone bosons started with the renormalization group techniques .",
    "brezin , wallace and wilson @xcite computed the equation of state for o(n ) @xmath3model using the @xmath42expansion.they found important differences from the corresponding calculation for the n=1 case ( i.e. the ising model).this could be traced to the infrared singularities due to the goldstone bosons that are present everywhere in the coexistence region for @xmath43 .",
    "in particular it meant that the conclusions of the tree level analysis could not be right ( atleast for @xmath30 ) .    at the critical point ( @xmath44 ) ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath15 are on the same footing .",
    "both their susceptibilities diverge with vanishing magnetic field as ,    @xmath45    governed by the critical exponent @xmath46 .",
    "the question of interest is the behaviour for @xmath47 as @xmath48.the assumption that the singularities due to goldstone bosons exponentiate in the @xmath42expansion suggested that ,    @xmath49    holstein -primakoff @xcite , berlin - kac @xcite , and patashinski - pokrovski @xcite models have all made the same prediction .",
    "such a result has also been proved rigorously for o(2 ) case using correlation inequalities in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a deeper understanding can be obtained by considering the renormalization group flows shown in the figure below :    at the critical point , @xmath44 , the infrared dynamics is governed by the o(n ) non - gaussian fixed point @xmath50 when @xmath1.everywhere on the critical surface the renormalization group ( rg ) trajectories flow from the the o(n ) gaussian fixed point @xmath51 ( which is infrared unstable ) to the o(n ) non - gaussian fixed point @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath52 we have the symmetric phase with massive ( and degenerate ) @xmath3 and @xmath53.the infrared behaviour is governed by the trivial fixed point @xmath54 which corresponds to zero correlation length.@xmath47 presents a new feature compared to n=1 case ( i.e.the ising model ) .",
    "the theory has long range correlations for all @xmath55 as a consequence of the goldstone phenomenon.hence the infrared behaviour must be determined by a fixed point of infinite correlation length.what is this fixed point ?",
    "@xmath56 , the deviation from the critical temperature in statistical mechanics , is to be identified with the square of the renormalized mass @xcite in the linear @xmath3-model .",
    "in particular they are parameters with positive mass dimensionality . under rg flow",
    "they necessarily scale.thus , once @xmath57 , the flow is towards @xmath58.this means that we are interested in the zero temperature fixed point .",
    "an indication as to the nature of this fixed point came from a study of @xmath59expansion of o(n ) non  linear @xmath3model by brezin and zinn - justin @xcite .",
    "the o(n ) non - linear @xmath3- model in d=2 is renormalizable .",
    "even though the renormalized perturbation is in terms of the spin wave modes , mermin - wagner theorem @xcite requires that the system is never in a phase with spontaneously broken o(n ) symmetry .",
    "a hint of this is contained in the renormalized perturbation theory : the theory is asymptotically free.the coupling constant grows with the distance so that the long distance structure of the theory could be drastically different from the perturbation theory spectrum.indeed the spectrum is believed be that of massive and degenerate @xmath3 and @xmath15 s in the fundamental representation of o(n ) .",
    "a consequence of the asymptotic freedom in @xmath60 is that in @xmath61 , the @xmath62-function @xmath63 has a non - trivial zero ( say at @xmath64 ) in addition to the trivial zero , @xmath65 , corresponding to the theory of ( n-1 ) free scalars.at @xmath64 the theory is scale invariant and corresponds to the critical theory with n massless scalars and with anomalous dimensions ( denoted by @xmath66 ) .it should be noted in fig .",
    "1 that the fixed point @xmath50 of the linear @xmath67-model is identified with the fixed point @xmath66 of the non - linear model .",
    "this follows essentially from a remark made in @xcite that at @xmath50 the correlation functions of the linear model are identical to those of the non - linear model where in the latter one includes correlation functions of composite operators also .",
    "the coincidence of these two fixed points can also be established in the @xmath4-expansion scheme @xcite . for @xmath68",
    ", the coupling constant grows with the distance , and as in @xmath60 , the theory is in the unbroken phase .",
    "@xmath69 is of interest to us.in this case the infrared flow is towards @xmath65 .",
    "the infrared behaviour is of o(n-1 ) gaussian theory ( this fixed point is denoted by @xmath70 in fig.1 . ) and the ultraviolet behaviour is of the critical theory with anomalous dimensions .",
    "the fact that the infrared behaviour for @xmath69 is governed by the o(n-1 ) gaussian fixed point gives exhaustive information on the effects of quantum fluctuations of the goldstone bosons.it means that the pions decouple from each other at low momenta , and their propagators behave as the free propagators for small momenta.it also allows us to obtain the non - leading ir - behaviour as well as the effects of an external magnetic field.in particular we now understand why various heuristic considerations all gave the correct answer : it was the fortuitious behaviour of a free massless theory.anything more complicated would have been much more difficult to handle .",
    "upto what dimension d is the analysis of @xmath61 calculation correct?in particular is it applicable to d=4?the case d=4 is somewhat different because of the absence of the non - gaussian fixed point @xmath50.at the critical temperature the infrared behaviour is believed to be given by free massless theory of n scalars as the beta function is positive for small couplings ; there is no evidence for a non - gaussian fixed point.this appears to exclude the validity of the @xmath59 analysis to this case.we need an alternate technique to handle this situation.this is provided , for example , by the @xmath4 expansion .",
    "the @xmath4 expansion provides results which agree with the above analysis for all d.(the berlin - kac model @xcite is a variant of this technique . )",
    "it yields the non - gaussian fixed point for @xmath1 and shows its absence for @xmath2.in either case it shows that the leading infrared behaviour anywhere in the broken phase is given by n-1 free pions.the only handicap of this technique is that it does not provide non - anomalous dimension for the non - gaussian fixed point @xmath50 in the leading n approximation.however even this is overcome once one takes higher order ( in @xmath4 ) corrections .",
    "there are also indications that the technique gives qualitatively correct and quantitatively reasonable results for all @xmath71 .",
    "the fact that even in d=4 the pion dynamics is governed by the o(n-1 ) gaussian fixed point @xmath70 in the infrared has important implications.in particular the propagator of @xmath3 ( to be interpreted as the o(n ) partner of the pions ) has an universal logarithmic singularity in the infrared region ,    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the renormalisation scale .",
    "this follows from the same arguments as for @xmath30 , in particular because @xmath27 in the infrared.this feature is present whether @xmath3-propagator has a pole at some @xmath74 or not .",
    "the precise location of the pole is a non - universal feature depending on the microscopic dynamics .",
    "it could have interesting implications for nuclear forces at low energies in the sigma-channel ( i.e. , spin j=0,isospin i=0 ) as will be discussed elsewhere .    in sec . 3 and 4",
    "we develop a new formalism for @xmath75 which will allow for explicit calculation of all correlation functions even away from the infrared regime.we will explicitly demonstrate all the properties mentioned above.our formalism gives the same results in the leading infrared limit whether one starts with the linear or the non - linear @xmath3- model .    that the pions behave like free massless bosons in the infrared limit , in any @xmath76 , is such a general phenomenon that there should be an easier way of understanding it .",
    "a careful analysis of the proof of the goldstone theorem along with current algebra and pcac provide one such non - perturbative argument.another is the treatment based on ward identities given in sec 5.low energy theorems based on pcac and current algebra do imply that pions decouple from each other and with other matter at low momenta , but they do not directly imply that the pion has a canonical dimension in the infrared.current algebra requires that the current coupling to the pion has canonical dimension @xmath77 .",
    "however , the canonical dimension ( for the @xmath78 behaviour of the pion ) is @xmath79 .",
    "this only means that the pcac relating the two needs a dimensionful parameter , but does not directly relate the two dimensions .",
    "consider the time ordered correlation function of a current in a broken direction and the corresponding @xmath15 field :    @xmath80    we get ,    @xmath81 \\mid 0 > \\not = 0\\ ] ]    since @xmath82 = \\sigma(0 ) $ ] has a non - zero expectation value .",
    "this means for the fourier transform of this correlation function ,    @xmath83    this requires that in the spectral representation of the correlation function there is necessarily a @xmath84 contribution implying a _ simple pole _ at zero mass.any other singularity , such as a branch point will not satisfy the above equation .",
    "the fact that the @xmath3 channel also has an infrared singularity is equally general and should be understandable in a general way . in sec .",
    "5 and 6 we provide two proofs which rely essentially on symmetry arguments .",
    "the first uses ward identities , and the second , the schwinger- dyson equations .",
    "it was argued in sec .",
    "2 that the leading term in @xmath4 expansion retains all important effects of the goldstone boson fluctuations .",
    "analytic calculations are possible in this limit and therefore we can analyse such effects in detail.there is an extensive literature on this technique @xcite.in this section we provide a new arsenal to this technique.we define a generalized generating functional of one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertices and obtain an explicit expression for it in the large n limit .",
    "this is made possible by involving an auxiliary field .",

    "our large - n derivation , which links the divergence of the @xmath186 to the special properties of the auxiliary field also demonstrates the universal features in a very straightforward manner .",

    "this is precisely the same quantity that governs the universal divergence of @xmath186 .",
