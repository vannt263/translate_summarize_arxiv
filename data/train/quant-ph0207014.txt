    "blanchard and jadczyk @xcite have proposed an extension of standard ( non - relativistic ) quantum mechanics called event - enhanced quantum theory ( eeqt ) which main idea is to view the total system as consisting of coupled classical and quantum part .",
    "the pure states of the quantum part are wave functions which are not directly observable , whereas the pure states of the classical part can be observed without disturbing them",
    ". changes of the classical pure states are discrete and irreversible , they are called events .",
    "a review about applications of eeqt is for example @xcite .",
    "blanchard and jadczyk have also introduced a relativistic extension of eeqt @xcite using the idea of a proper time and an indefinite scalar product .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have presented an alternative approach for a relativistic extension of eeqt .",
    "we summarize this approach in .",
    "the question when a particle arrives at a given point can not be answered unambiguously in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a lot of approaches to answer the question of `` time - of - arrival ''",
    ". a review about `` time - of - arrival '' can be for example found in muga , sala , and palao @xcite and an extensive review including a lot of references is muga and leavens @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a two dimensional spacetime .",
    "we examine the following operational definition of the time - of - arrival : the particle is prepared in a space - time point @xmath1 and moves freely ( except of the influence exerted on it by the detector ) in positive @xmath2 direction .",
    "a detector is put at @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "it measures the time - of - arrival of the particle at @xmath3 . because it is possible that the particle is never detected , the experiment or simulation should be stopped after a reasonable and finite period of time .",
    "this definition of time - of - arrival has been examined in the framework of non - relativistic eeqt @xcite . in of this paper",
    ", we will compute the time - of - arrival using our relativistic extension of eeqt and we will compare the results to those obtained by using classical relativistic mechanics of a point particle .",
    "the question how long a particle needs to traverse a given finite region can not also be answered unambiguously in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this time is called traversal time .",
    "it is often examined if a potential is in the given region and the particle must tunnel through the region .",
    "reviews about `` traversal time '' and `` tunnelling time '' including a lot of references are for example @xcite .",
    "`` tunnelling time '' has been also examined using the non - relativistic eeqt @xcite .    in of this paper",
    ", we examine the `` free traversal time '' for an always freely moving particle ( again except of the influence exerted on the particle by the detectors ) .    using two detectors at rest one behind the other",
    ", we can measure the traversal time through the region located between the two detectors : the particle is again prepared in a space - time point @xmath1 and moves in positive @xmath2-direction .",
    "we put a detector @xmath5 at @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this detector can detect the particle without destroying it . a second detector @xmath8 is put at @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "it destroys the particle after detection .    at the beginning of the measurement ,",
    "both detectors @xmath5 and @xmath8 are active . if detector @xmath5 detects the particle ( without destroying it ) , it turns itself off , but detector @xmath8 stays turned on . if detector @xmath8 detects the particle , the experiment is finished .",
    "thus , the particle can be detected by detector @xmath5 at a time @xmath11 and then by detector @xmath8 at a time @xmath12 .",
    "if this happens , the time difference @xmath13 is defined to be the `` traversal time '' .",
    "it is also possible that the particle is detected by @xmath8 without prior detection by @xmath5 , but this situation should not contribute to traversal times .",
    "moreover , it is possible that the particle is never detected or only detected one time by detector @xmath5 . for this reason",
    "the experiment or simulation should be stopped after a reasonable and finite period of time .",
    "we will compute the traversal time using our relativistic extension of eeqt .",
    "again we will compare the results to those obtained using classical relativistic mechanics of a point particle .",
    "we recall the extension of eeqt which we have proposed in @xcite .",
    "it describes one spin @xmath0-particle in a relativistic way and in four dimensional spacetime . here , we restrict ourself to consider two dimensional spacetime .    as in eeqt",
    ", we postulate that the total system consists of a classical and a quantum part which are coupled . because of that",
    ", at a given proper time @xmath14 , the ( pure ) state of the total system is a pair @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the state of the classical part and @xmath17 is the state of the quantum part .",
    "we assume that a ( pure ) state @xmath16 of the classical part is a number : @xmath18 .",
    "we also call a change of the classical ( pure ) state `` event '' as in non - relativistic eeqt .",
    "the ( pure ) states of the quantum part shall be ( heuristically ) solutions @xmath19 of the dirac equation .",
    "because we examine only free particles in this paper , we use the free dirac equation : @xmath20 with @xmath21 . we denote the space of quantum states by @xmath22 .",
    "a more precise definition of @xmath22 can be found in @xcite .",
    "we use the dirac or standard representation of the @xmath23-matrices .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "we now introduce a positive - definite scalar product between two quantum states @xmath27 : @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denotes the differential `` surface '' element of @xmath32 .",
    "this scalar product is well defined because it is independent of @xmath33 .",
    "this follows from gauss theorem and the fact that @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , one can show that this scalar product is covariant , its value being independent of the reference frame .",
    "we introduce the operators @xmath35 with @xmath36 : @xmath37 an interesting property of a quantum state is that it is uniquely given by its values on a space - like hyperplane @xmath32 . therefore ,",
    "the operators @xmath35 are invertible .",
    "@xmath38 is the solution of the free dirac equation ( [ sec2_dirac ] ) fulfilling the initial condition @xmath39 .",
    "we get @xmath40    now , we want to formulate an algorithm for modelling continuous relativistic measurements , indeed we will propose in the following an algorithm to simulate detections of the particle . in principle , we will do this by rewriting the algorithm of eeqt , replacing @xmath41 with @xmath14 and using our hilbert space of `` solutions . ''",
    "we denote the reference frame by @xmath42 .",
    "the particle is prepared at proper time @xmath43 in a point @xmath44 .",
    "we consider @xmath45 detectors with trajectories @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the trajectories start at proper time @xmath48 from the backward light - cone of the space - time point of the `` preparation event '' : @xmath49    we allow detections which happen in the past of the preparation time .",
    "but we do not allow detections , if the detection space - time point is located in the backward light - cone of the space - time point of the preparation event .",
    "each detector is characterized by operators @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the adjoint operator .",
    "the total coupling between the quantum and the classical part is given by @xmath52 .",
    "we define a detection algorithm in the following way :    * the particle is prepared in a space - time point @xmath44 at proper time @xmath53 .",
    "the quantum state is @xmath54 with @xmath55 and the classical state is @xmath56 .",
    "* choose uniformly a random number @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "* propagate the quantum state forward in proper time by solving @xmath58 until @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 let @xmath62 until @xmath63 , a detection happens at proper time @xmath59 .",
    "* we choose the detector @xmath64 - which detects the particle - with probability @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "* let @xmath67 be the detector which detects effectively the particle .",
    "the detection happens at the point @xmath68 .",
    "the detection induces the following change of the states : @xmath69    the algorithm can start again perhaps with other detectors at position ( ii ) .    because the scalar product is covariant , this algorithm is covariant .",
    "moreover , its non - relativistic limit reduces to the algorithm of the non - relativistic eeqt .",
    "if we `` charge conjugate '' the initial state @xmath70 and the detector functions @xmath71 with @xmath72 , then the algorithm will give the same detections as if we start with @xmath54 and @xmath73 ( if we choose the same random numbers ) .",
    "the quantum state in the `` charge conjugated '' world @xmath74 and the quantum state in the `` normal '' world are always connected by @xmath75 .",
    "note , that we have also formulated an algorithm for modelling ideal measurements of infinitesimal small duration in @xcite .",
    "it can be seen as playing the role of a relativistic , covariant reduction postulate .",
    "the particle is prepared at proper time @xmath48 in the space - time point @xmath1 with a mean momentum @xmath76 .",
    "we examine three different initial states of the particle in this paper .",
    "remember that a initial states of the particle must be a solution of the dirac equation ( [ sec2_dirac ] ) .",
    "the first state corresponds to a state with only positive energies : @xmath77 with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 being a normalization factor so that @xmath83 .",
    "this state describes an electron with charge @xmath84 .",
    "the second one corresponds to a state with only negative energies : @xmath85 with @xmath86 being a normalization factor so that @xmath87 .",
    "remember that the above algorithm is invariant under charge conjugation .",
    "if we consider the charge conjugate of the initial state and the detector functions , we get the same events .",
    "because the `` charge conjugated '' world and the `` normal world '' should describe the same physical situation and because the charge conjugation of @xmath88 describes a particle with charge @xmath89 in the `` charge conjugated world '' , we demand that the initial state @xmath88 describes a positron with charge @xmath89 also in the `` normal '' world .    as third initial state ,",
    "we want to use a mixed state : @xmath90 ( ct , x)\\\\ \\fl = \\frac{{\\sqrt{2\\eta } \\,}}{(2\\pi)^{3/4 } } \\int \\rmd k \\ , \\frac{1}{2\\hat{e } } { \\exp \\left ( -\\eta^2 \\left(k - \\frac{p_0}{\\hbar } \\right)^2 \\right ) } \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{e}+\\hat{m}\\\\0\\\\0\\\\k\\end{array}\\right ) \\cdot { \\exp \\left ( \\rmi k ( x - x_0 ) - \\rmi \\hat{e } ct \\right)}\\\\ \\fl + \\frac{{\\sqrt{2\\eta } \\,}}{(2\\pi)^{3/4 } } \\int \\rmd k \\ , \\frac{1}{2\\hat{e } } { \\exp \\left ( -\\eta^2 \\left(k + \\frac{p_0}{\\hbar } \\right)^2 \\right ) } \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{e}-\\hat{m}\\\\0\\\\0\\\\k\\end{array}\\right ) \\cdot { \\exp \\left ( -\\rmi k ( x - x_0 ) + \\rmi \\hat{e } ct \\right)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath91 .",
    "the constants are chosen in such a way that @xmath92 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the mixed state is the following : we assume that the particle ( a single particle ) can be in an `` electron - state''(solution with positive energies ) and in a `` positron - state '' ( solution with negative energies ) , in analogy to the case , that a particle can be e.g. in a spin @xmath93-state or in a spin @xmath94-state .",
    "superpositions as @xmath95 of the two states should be ( in analogy to the spin - case ) possible and allowed .",
    "in this section , we apply the above algorithm to simulate the detection of the particle by one detector which is at rest .",
    "we want to compare the results to those which we obtain by using classical relativistic mechanics of a point - particle .",
    "let us use the reference frame @xmath96 in which the detector is at rest . in this reference frame ,",
    "the particle is prepared at proper time @xmath97 in the space - time point @xmath1 with a mean momentum @xmath76 .",
    "the detector is put at @xmath3 , its trajectory is @xmath98 .",
    "the coupling operator should be given by @xmath99 with @xmath100 characterizing the sensitivity of the detector : @xmath101 the adjoint operator is @xmath102 .",
    "because it is possible that the particle is never detected , we stop the algorithm at @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 large ) .",
    "we want to recall that the algorithm is covariant . the choice of @xmath96 as the reference frame is arbitrary .",
    "the algorithm can be applied in any reference frame , and it will result ( if we choose the same random numbers ) the same events in all reference frames",
    ".    using our algorithm , the probability that the detector detects the particle at all is given by @xmath105 the probability density for a `` proper time - of - arrival '' at the detector is given by ( @xmath106 ) @xmath107 it is zero for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "using this probability density for `` proper time - of - arrival '' , we can calculate the probability density and the expectation value for the time - of - arrival in an arbitrary reference frame .",
    "let us first look at the detector s rest - frame @xmath96 .",
    "if a detection happens at proper time @xmath14 , then it happens in space - time point @xmath110 .",
    "this implies a time - of - arrival of @xmath111 .",
    "so we get the following probability density for the time - of - arrival in the detector s rest - frame @xmath96 : @xmath112 the expectation value ( or mean time - of - arrival ) is @xmath113    now , we want to calculate these values in a reference frame @xmath114 which moves with velocity @xmath115 with respect to the detector s rest - frame @xmath96 .",
    "the poincar - transformation @xmath116 has the following form : @xmath117 the detector trajectory in @xmath114 is @xmath118 so the normalized probability density for the time - of - arrival in the reference frame @xmath114 is given by @xmath119 and the expectation value ( or mean time - of - arrival ) in @xmath114 is given by @xmath120 \\label{sec4_conn_diff_rf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we use the reference frame @xmath96 to compute @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath122 if @xmath17 is a solution of ( [ sec2_dirac ] ) and ( [ sec2_dgl ] ) , then we get @xmath123 we have to solve this equation with the initial condition @xmath124 . using @xmath125",
    ", we can calculate @xmath126 and @xmath121 if we know @xmath127 .",
    "using @xmath121 , we get @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
