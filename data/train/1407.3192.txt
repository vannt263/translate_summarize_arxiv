    "non - perturbative qcd is a rather complicated subject , whose solution remains elusive . in particular , analytic approaches to the dynamics of the lowest - lying light - flavored resonances",
    "have proved to be way more difficult than to the lightest pseudoscalar mesons , for which an effective field theory dual to qcd at low energies ( chiral perturbation theory , @xmath2 ) exists @xcite .",
    "the main reason behind is the difficulty to find a suitable expansion parameter in the resonance region , where the @xmath2 one , in powers of momenta and light meson masses over the chiral symmetry breaking scale , is no longer small and thus non - applicable . +",
    "a formal expansion for a large number of colours @xcite in powers of @xmath3 succeeds to explain the most salient features of meson phenomenology , both at the fundamental and at the effective field theory levels @xcite with a typical accuracy that turns out to be much better than the naive @xmath4 estimate . +",
    "a concrete realization of these ideas are resonance chiral lagrangians ( @xmath5 ) @xcite , which are built adding to the lowest order @xmath2 lagrangian ( which corresponds to the realization of the chiral anomaly in @xmath2 @xcite in the odd - intrinsic parity sector ) operators with an increasing number of resonance fields and chiral operators appearing already in the @xmath2 framework .",
    "chiral symmetry for the latter and @xmath6 symmetry for the former determine the allowed operators , leaving however their couplings unrestricted . + it is useful to recall at this point that not only the low - energy limit of meson dynamics is known . on the other end ,",
    "the operator product expansion ( ope ) of qcd @xcite allows to derive its short - distance behavior as well .",
    "@xmath5 are thus thought to provide a bridge between these two known regimes .",
    "this interpolation is more reliable for the so - called order parameters of chiral symmetry breaking ( the perturbative contribution to them vanishes to all orders ) , where more precisely we will be considering green functions and related form - factors . in some sense , this procedure implements at the lagrangian level pad and related rational approximants studied in previous works  @xcite .",
    "thus , one should be aware of the uncertainties and caveats raised therein when the infinite large-@xmath0 spectrum is truncated and one just keeps the lightest resonances .",
    "+ a well - known example that illustrates all the above easily comes from the weinberg sum rules @xcite .",
    "according to them , qcd predicts that the two - point vector correlator between left- and right - handed quark fields vanishes at least as fast as @xmath7 when the squared euclidean momentum , @xmath8 , goes to infinity .",
    "the corresponding evaluation within @xmath5 @xcite restricted to the lightest meson multiplets ( single resonance approximation corrections will be neglected . ] ) yields , in the chiral limit , @xmath9 and the high - energy limit mentioned above imposes @xmath10 giving the _ a priori _ free coupling of the ( axial-)vector resonance to the ( axial-)vector current , ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 in terms of the corresponding masses and the pion decay constant , @xmath13 . + we will finish this introduction by recalling that there are two ways of approaching the asymptotic behavior of qcd in order to demand the correct short - distance limit :    * the high - energy qcd limit of a given green function ( @xmath14 in what follows ) is computed using the ope and this behavior is required for the corresponding computation using a @xmath15 . *",
    "the qcd one - loop result for the imaginary part of the ( axial-)vector(axial-)vector correlator @xcite predicts that , at high energies , it must go to a definite constant value . by the optical theorem",
    ", this absorptive contribution can be equivalently obtained through a sum over the infinite number of possible intermediate on - shell cuts , given by the corresponding form - factors .",
    "a plausible assumption for recovering a constant through the infinite sum is that the contribution from each channel vanishes as @xmath1 asymptotically , reproducing the celebrated brodsky - lepage prediction @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the latter also fixes the corresponding coefficient of the @xmath1 term .",
    "a seeming discrepancy between some of the constraints in the anomaly sector was found depending on whether one used one or the other procedure sketched above  @xcite .",
    "this situation led us to a reanalysis of the compatibility of both approaches : our results @xcite showed that they were indeed equivalent , as it was also shown in the normal parity case @xcite .",
    "specifically , we show the existence of a consistent set of short - distance constraints on the anomalous resonance couplings within the single resonance approximation and in the @xmath16 limit  . representing the spin - one fields with antisymmetric tensors",
    "turns out to be crucial for this result . +",
    "new results appear in sec .",
    "[ new ] , where we use ultraviolet constraints to test the precise coefficient of the leading @xmath1 term in the high - energy expansion of the neutral and charged one - pion vector form - factors , related to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays , respectively .",
    "our results are in much better agreement with the brodsky - lepage coefficient than with other predictions .",
    "ref .  @xcite showed that , in the even - intrinsic parity sector , it was possible to match the qcd short - distance behavior ( for a selected set of green functions and form factors ) with a resonance chiral lagrangian .",
    "noteworthy , it showed that representing spin - one resonances in the antisymmetric tensor formalism , local operators of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath2 lagrangian were not needed for this matching .",
    "these operators without resonance fields were nevertheless needed if one chose the four - vector proca representation for the spin - one mesons .",
    "this suggested the convenience of the antisymmetric tensor formalism , as it provided a simpler @xmath5 .",
    "+ conversely , refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the anomalous sector was more complicated . specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that the four - vector representation could not match the ope results even including higher - order @xmath2 operators , an important result which casted serious doubts on the usefulness of the resonance lagrangians in the anomalous sector .",

    "we note that the reduced uncertainty comes basically from the appearance of new data on the meson transition form - factors extending to larger energies and not from our refined theoretical setting .",

    "we consider now our consistent set of asymptotic constraints on the anomalous resonance couplings ( [ eq.consistent-set-of-relations ] ) from another perspective that sheds light on the coefficient of the leading @xmath1-term in the asymptotic high - energy expansion of meson form - factors .",
    "we will in particular consider three predictions , using light - cone perturbation theory @xcite , the ope @xcite and the bjorken - johnson - low theorem @xcite .",

    "a consistent minimal set of short - distance constraints on the anomalous @xmath5 couplings which applies to the vvp green function and related form - factors has been found solving a seeming discrepancy in the literature .",
    "interestingly , although eq .",
    "( [ eq.consistent-set-of-relations ] ) derives only from the @xmath14 green function analysis and the requirement of the vanishing of the anomalous form - factors at high energies , one can extract a prediction for the leading term in the expansion , @xmath52 : the coefficients we obtained in the two form - factors studied here , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , reasonably agree with the brodsky - lepage result  @xcite , which is preferred with respect to alternative high - energy behaviors from other works  @xcite .",
