    "globular clusters in our galaxy do not define a single homogeneous population with a single history . in his pioneering work , zinn ( 1985 ) subdivided the globular clusters into the  halo \" and the  thick disk \" groups at [ fe / h ] = @xmath00.8 .",
    "the halo clusters have an essentially spherical distribution about the galactic center and they constitute a pressure supported system ( a small rotational velocity and a larger velocity dispersion ) , while the thick disk clusters have a highly flattened spatial distribution and constitute a rotational supported system ( a larger rotational velocity and a smaller velocity dispersion ) .",
    "searle & zinn ( 1978 ) and lee , demarque , & zinn ( 1994 ) suggested that the inner halo globular clusters exhibit a tight horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology versus [ fe / h ] relation , while the outer halo globular clusters show the second parameter phenomenon ( i.e. , a larger scatter in hb typer)/(b+v+r ) , where b , v , r are the numbers of blue hb stars , rr lyrae variables , red hb stars , respectively ( lee , demarque , & zinn 1990 ) . ] at a given [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "subsequently , zinn ( 1993 ) subdivided the halo clusters into two groups .",
    "the  old halo \" group obeys the same hb type versus [ fe / h ] relationship as the inner halo clusters while the  younger halo \" group deviates from this relationship by a significant amount ( see figure  [ fig : hbiso ] ) .",
    "zinn ( 1993 ) and da costa & armandroff ( 1995 ) argued that the old and the younger halo groups have different kinematic properties that the old halo group has a prograde mean rotation velocity with a smaller velocity dispersion while the younger halo group has a retrograde mean rotation velocity about the galactic center with a larger velocity dispersion .",
    "they suggested that the old halo group formed during the collapse that led ultimately to the formation of the galactic disk and the younger halo group were accreted later in time .",
    "if so , one would expect to see signatures of different chemical enrichment history carved in spectra of stars in globular clusters .",
    "for example , one might be able to investigate the early form of the initial mass function ( imf ) by studying abundances of stellar mass - sensitive elements ( see discussion and references in mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "an alternative perspective on  younger halo \" and  old halo \" clusters is that of dissolved and accreted dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , freeman ( 1993 ) suggested that the massive and chemically unusual globular cluster @xmath5  cen might be the remnant nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy .",
    "lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) noted the possible alignments of orbital poles of some globular clusters such that they might comprise a  spoor \" ( more commonly referred to as a stream ) of clusters . while the specific details have not found support , the idea has been demonstrated very nicely by dinescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who found a clear dynamical relationship between the space motions of the young globular cluster palomar  12 and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .",
    "indeed , other globular clusters may also be associated with this particular accretion event ( ngc 5634 : bellazzini , ferraro , & ibata 2002 ; ngc  4147 : bellazzini et al .",
    "2003 ; palomar  2 : majewski et al .  2004 ) .",
    "yoon & lee ( 2002 ) have similarly speculated on a dynamical relationship between some metal - poor globular clusters , including m68 .",
    "yoon & lee ( 2002 ) suggested that m68 was a member of a satellite galaxy and accreted later in time to our galaxy , resulting in a planar motion of several metal - poor clusters including m15 and m92 .    dynamical evolution in the galaxy",
    "can eventually dissolve streams , making their detection difficult . however , an interesting alternative exists , called  chemical tagging \" .",
    "as freeman & bland - hawthorn ( 2002 ) discussed , stars born in galaxies whose star formation histories differ from those that have created the bulk of the galaxy s stars may still be discernible in unusual element - to - iron ratios .",
    "indeed , cohen ( 2004 ) has found a compelling link between palomar  12 and the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "detailed chemical abundances of globular clusters may yet become the principle means of identifying historical links between stars and clusters that are now widely dispersed in our galaxy .",
    "m68 ( ngc  4590 ) is part of the younger halo , according to its hb type with respect to its metallicity , and is located 10 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "dinescu , girard , & van  altena ( 1999 ) have found that the cluster s galactic orbit carries it rather far from the galactic center , perhaps as far as 30 kpc .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : hbiso ] , globular clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 @xmath02.0 have hb types that are greater than 0.6 with the exception of m68 . if age is the second parameter , m68 represents the low metallicity tail of the younger halo globular clusters .",
    "the absolute age of m68 does appears to be slightly younger than those of the oldest globular clusters in our galaxy .",
    "rosenberg et al .  ( 1999 ) argued that m68 is coeval to or slightly younger than those of the oldest halo globular clusters while vandenberg ( 2000 ) discussed that the age of m68 is less than that of m92 , one of the oldest globular clusters in our galaxy , by @xmath7 15% .",

    "however , the lower resolving power of the observations reported by gratton & ortolani ( 1989 ) , about 15,000 , appears to have led to systematically larger equivalent widths , as figure  [ fig : compew ] reveals .",
    "the mean difference is @xmath17 m .",

    "the abundance analysis depends mainly on the reliability of the oscillator strength values of the fe  i and fe  ii lines , since not only the metallicity scale but also the stellar parameters , including the spectroscopic temperature , surface gravity , and microturbulent velocity , will be determined using these lines . as discussed by lee & carney ( 2002 ) , we mainly relied upon the extensive laboratory oscillator strength measurements by the oxford group ( blackwell et al .",

    "it has been suspected by others that the traditional spectroscopic surface gravity determination method which requires the same elemental abundances derived from neutral and singly ionized lines ( preferentially fe  i and fe  ii lines ) suffers from non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) effects ( see , for example , nissen et al .",

    "nissen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) claimed that surface gravities of metal - poor dwarfs and subgiants derived from the spectroscopic method , which demands that fe  i and fe  ii lines should provide the same iron abundance , are a factor of two or three ( @xmath28 0.3  0.5 ) smaller than those from the hipparcos parallaxes .",

    "( 1997 , 2000 ) , and then discuss these in turn compared to other ensembles of field stars and clusters .",
    "we select m15 because it is one of the few metal - poor globular clusters with comparable data for the neutron capture elements lanthanum , barium , and europium , and partly because of the hypothesized common origin ( yoon & lee 2002 ) .",
    "many globular clusters appear to show anticorrelations between the abundances of oxygen and sodium , and of magnesium and aluminum .",
    "the subject was reviewed by kraft ( 1994 ) , and has been revisited by numerous authors .",
    "the approach often taken has been that these anticorrelations arise from deep mixing , whereby material whose chemical compositions have been altered by proton captures within the cno cycle have been brought to the stellar surface .",
    "this concept has become less plausible with the discovery that such anticorrelations are seen in relatively unevolved stars in the metal - poor clusters ngc  6397 and ngc  6752 ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) and in the metal - rich cluster 47  tuc ( carretta et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the variations seen in some of these elements in table  5 nonetheless warrant a quick look at these possible anti - correlations in m68 , and we show them here in figure  [ fig : ona ] , in comparison with the results for m15 from sneden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "there are three relatively interesting results here .",
    "first is that m68 does show a variation , especially in sodium .",
    "the second is that the large range in sodium abundances is matched by a correlated ( or anti - correlated ) variation in the oxygen abundances , as appears to be the case for m15 . finally , the post - agb star 117 , indicated by an open square in the figure , is consistent with no signs of deep mixing , despite it clearly being the most evolved star in our study .",
    "the lack of an anti - correlation and the lack of variations seen in star 117 are consistent with a primordial variation for the differences in elemental abundances , presumably due to pollution during the earliest stages of the cluster formation and evolution by agb nucleosynthesis and mass loss .",
    "table  5 shows that the other light elements , silicon , calcium , and titanium , do not show any detectable variation in their abundances .",
    "these elements are of considerable interest nonetheless because they provide us with an opportunity to compare the nucleosynthesis histories of clusters , and , in principle , a means to compare the rate of star formation and , possibly , relative ages .",
    "if star formation began everywhere in the galaxy at about the same time , then the abundances of elements that emerge from type ii supernovae , including these light elements and @xmath4-process elements such as europium , will be enhanced relative to the abundances of elements that emerge from nucleosynthesis sites that appear more gradually , including @xmath58-process elements from agb stars , and iron - peak elements from type  ia supernovae .",
    "the details are complex , but this basic picture is consistent with the basic behavior of these  @xmath3 \" elements abundances ( see the discussions of wyse & gilmore 1988 ; wheeler et al .",
    "1989 , and carney 1996 ) .",
    "if we compute unweighted averages for silicon , calcium , and titanium , we find for m68 that [ @xmath3/fe ] = @xmath59 , which is roughly consistent with that found in m15 and other globular clusters . in table  [ tab : alpha ] , we summarize the [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] , and the mean [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios of m68 , other globular clusters ( gratton 1987 ; gratton & ortolani 1989 ; kraft et al .",

    "the mean values of [ @xmath3/fe ] do not appear to vary much , and are probably consistent within the internal errors ( the simple averages ) and any lingering systematic errors .    a closer examination of the abundances of these elements",
    "does reveal some interesting differences , however .",
    "the silicon abundance of m68 appears to be similar to that found in m15 , and both are enhanced relative to those of other clusters and field stars .",
    "the calcium abundance of m68 is likewise similar to those found in m15 , and both are similar to other halo stars and clusters .",
    "there may , however , be a modest difference ( @xmath7 0.15 dex ) between m68 , m15 , and other ",
    "old halo \" clusters and  younger halo \" and thick disk clusters .",
    "note that this contradicts the assignment of m68 to the  younger halo \" category .",
    "on the other hand , the titanium abundance of m68 appears to be much lower than all other clusters .",
    "is this effect real ?",
    "the titanium abundance of the metal - poor rgb stars using the neutral titanium lines may suffer from nlte effects , such as an over - ionization , and the resultant ti abundance may be spurious . however , our ti abundance analyses using the ti  ii lines also yield a lower titanium abundance for our program stars , indicating that they are truly titanium deficient . in figure",
    "[ fig : synspec ] , we show comparisons of observed spectrum of the star 93 with those of synthetic spectra near si  i @xmath27 5665.56and ti  i @xmath27 6258.11 , 6258.71 , and 6261.11 . in the figure , the observed spectrum is presented by histograms , synthetic spectra with [ si / fe ] = + 0.68 , [ ti / fe ] = + 0.06 by solid lines ( see also table  [ tab : abundph ] ) , and synthetic spectra with [ si / fe ] = + 0.30 , [ ti / fe ] = + 0.30 , which elemental abundances have long been thought to be _ normal _ ( if there exists normal elemental abundances among globular clusters ) for globular clusters , by dotted lines . the observed spectrum clearly shows that the si  i absorption line is too strong to be [ si / fe ] = + 0.30 , while the ti  i absorption lines are too weak to be [ ti / fe ] = + 0.30 .",
    "so the deficiency appears to be real .    while we have included this element because its abundances often track those of the lighter elements , including oxygen , magnesium , silicon , and calcium , titanium",
    "may also be considered to be an iron - leak element .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis calculations of the massive stars ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) predict that one of the major sources of the sne  ii titanium yield is @xmath62cr via the consecutive electron capture processes . further , their models predicted that sne  ii with masses in the range 25 - 40 @xmath63 are likely to overproduce si compared with ti .",
    "we turn , therefore , to a more detailed comparison between m68 and m15 , concentrating on the light element silicon , thought to be mostly produced in type  ii supernovae , and nickel , mostly associated with type  ia supernovae .",

    "our seven stars reveal @xmath30[ni / fe]@xmath56 = @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) dex .",
    "we are uncertain how to compare our results to those from sneden et al .",

    "sneden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) commented on the difficulties in establishing truly reliable stellar parameters and abundances , and , alas , this difference is yet another aspect of that problem .",
    "we conclude our discussion of these elements with the possibility that the stars we have studied in m68 sampled a relatively high end of the initial mass function and the resultant supernovae .",
    "the elements heavier than the iron - peak elements can not be efficiently produced by the charged - particle interactions due to the large coulomb repulsion between the nuclei , and they are thought to be produced through both slow ( @xmath58- ) and rapid ( @xmath4- ) neutron capture processes .",
    "the @xmath58-process occurs mainly in low- ( 1 - 3 @xmath63 ) or intermediate - mass ( 4 - 7 @xmath63 ) agb stars , while the @xmath4-process is thought to occur in type ii supernovae explosions .",
    "therefore , comparisons between the @xmath4-process ( europium ) and @xmath58-process elements ( barium and lanthanum ) provide a clue to the history of the galactic nucleosynthesis , since @xmath4- and @xmath58-processes are thought to occur in stars with very different masses and , therefore , in different evolutionary timescales .    burris et al .",

    "( 1997 , 2000 ) warn us that we can not assume all supernovae produce the same heavy element abundance yields . in the case of m15",

    "that process produced different absolute amounts of the neutron capture elements in stars in m15 , but the process itself yielded the same relative abundances of the two elements .",
    "our results for the stars in m68 are consistent with this general picture , in that the barium and europium abundance ratio is constant , and essentially the same in m68 and in m15 .",
    "sneden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the  low barium \" and  high barium \" groups of stars in m15 had similar [ ba / eu ] ratios , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) dex for all eighteen stars .",
    "our seven stars , including the post - agb star 117 , yield @xmath30[ba / eu]@xmath56 = @xmath71 ( @xmath70 ) dex . what different between the two clusters , however , is that both barium and europium are lower in abundance in m68 than the stars in m15 , even the  low barium \" stars .",
    "thus m68 was slightly less enriched in @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis , relative to iron .",
    "we could interpret our results in an alternative fashion , that iron is enhanced relative to the @xmath4-process elements , in this case including barium and europium .",
    "for [ la / eu ] we must turn to the smaller sample of sneden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who studied three stars in m15 with very different [ ba / fe ] ratios , @xmath72 , + 0.05 , and + 0.05 .",
    "the [ la / fe ] values also vary greatly for these three stars : @xmath73 , + 0.38 , and + 0.61 , yet the variation seen in [ la / eu ] is much smaller , and consistent with the measurement uncertainties : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , for a mean value of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) dex .",
    "we were able to estimate [ la / eu ] values for three of our program stars , and we find @xmath30[la / eu]@xmath56 = @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) dex .",
    "thus for both lanthanum and barium , it appears the @xmath4 process is dominating the nucleosynthesis enrichment in both m68 and in m15 , and yielding constant relative abundances of the elements . but as in the case of barium and europium , there is an underabundance of lanthanum relative to iron in m68 compared to m15 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : compm15 ] , we summarize graphically the many similarities between the abundances of various elements , relative to iron , in m68 compared to m15 .",
    "perhaps the two most striking differences are in the much lower titanium abundances in m68 , which , as we have seen , might be explained by a greater contribution from more massive stars and their supernovae events in m68 relative to m15 . on the other hand , while it appears that the @xmath4-process has dominated the production of the  traditional \" @xmath58-process elements lanthanum and barium , and that the [ la / eu ] and [ ba / eu ] ratios are the same for all the stars in both clusters , the overall @xmath4-process enrichment varies within m15 ( sneden et al .  1997 ) and between m68 and m15 . the clusters have clearly experienced somewhat different chemical enrichment histories , and it will be interesting to see if models of supernovae enrichment ultimately prove successful in explaining these differences and what this means for the histories and , perhaps , ages of these clusters .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : cabaeu ] we show the results for individual stars in the abundance ratio of barium and europium , plotted against [ ca / h ] rather than [ fe / h ] . as",

    "there are two notable differences between m68 and the comparably metal - poor cluster m15 .",
    "while both show enhanced [ si / fe ] ratios relative to other clusters and comparably metal - poor field stars , m68 is quite deficient in titanium compared to m15 or any other cluster .",
    "it is possible that this arose because nucleosynthesis enrichment of the stars in m68 was provided by supernovae resulting from the deaths of somewhat more massive progenitors .",
    "this would be difficult to reconcile with the nominal younger age for m68 compared to m15 , based on the morphologies of their horizontal branch stars distribution in temperature / color .",

    "<S> m68 shares the same [ ba / eu ] ratio as the stars in m15 , but the average abundance ratio of these elements , and lanthanum , are lower in m68 relative to iron than in m15 , implying a slightly weaker contribution of @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis in m68 . </S>"
