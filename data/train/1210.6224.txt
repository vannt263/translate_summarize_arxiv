    "we focused on branch - ii@xmath208 hm solutions because a branch - i hm solution is shown to be equivalent to a branch - ii solution with a different set of the model parameters .    the euclidean action of the hm instanton is found to have two distinct terms .",
    "in addition to the standard contribution determined by the hubble parameter of the hm solution , we obtained a mass - dependent non - standard term . to study the effect of this latter non - standard contributions , we compared the tunneling rate to that in gr for the same value of the hubble parameter .    for branch ii@xmath209 , the enhancement or suppression of the tunneling rate relative to gr",
    "is determined by the sign of a quantity , denoted by @xmath120 , and it depends on the model parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we found that in a wide area of the parameter space the tunneling rate is enhanced for branch ii@xmath128 and suppressed for branch ii@xmath129 .",
    "we also found that the solution can exist only if the hubble parameter of the ratio of the physical metric to the fiducial one is greater than @xmath139 . as a result",
    ", the form of the potential is constrained .",
    "this seems to imply that tunneling from or to a vacuum whose energy density is less than a critical value is prohibited .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast to gr for which there is no bound on the minimum value of the potential .",
    "as tunneling mediated by a hm instanton is considered to be equivalent to stochastic process of going over the barrier due to large vacuum fluctuations intrinsic to light scalar fields in de sitter space  @xcite , it is interesting to understand the role of the graviton mass terms in the context of stochastic dynamics .",
    "we found that the tunneling rate can be enhanced or suppressed depending on the model parameters for a simple case of a tunneling field minimally couples with gravity .",
    "though we discussed this simple case as a first step , it will be interesting to see how the tunneling process proceeds when the model parameters such as the graviton mass depend on the tunneling field . in this case",
    ", the effective cosmological constant of a vacuum can be larger than the other while its potential energy is smaller because of the tunneling field dependence of the graviton mass .",
    "finally , let us comment on the limitation of our analysis . since massive gravity exhibits the strong coupling at high energy scales , it requires uv completion above its cutoff scale .",
    "namely , our analysis can not apply to an arbitrarily small size instanton nor to the potential of an arbitrarily high energy scale , though the limitation depends on how massive gravity is uv completed .",
    "the cutoff scale of massive gravity is determined by the graviton mass and it is very low if the graviton mass is of the order of the present hubble parameter to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe . however , as mentioned above , the graviton mass may depend on the tunneling field and may have a larger value in the early universe . in this case , our analysis can be applied to the tunneling process at high energy scales .",
    "in the text , we focused on hm solutions based on branch ii constraint ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) . here , we show that the hm solution in branch i is equivalent to the one in branch ii with a different set of the model parameters .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdefinition ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) , we obtain @xmath210 hence @xmath211 inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom0 ] ) and setting @xmath212 , we obtain an algebraic equation , @xmath213 where @xmath214\\ , , \\quad \\theta\\equiv\\frac{\\sqrt{k - a^{\\prime2}}}{fa}=\\frac{b}{a}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath215 becomes constant .",
    "the hm solution in branch i is obtained as @xmath216 comparing this with eqs .  (",
    "[ eq : ii ] ) and ( [ eq : ahmsol ] ) , we see that the form of the solutions are the same except that @xmath69 and @xmath102 are replaced by @xmath217 and @xmath218 , respectively .",
    "we note that the quantity corresponding to @xmath219 in branch i is unity .",
    "thus , we conclude that the analysis of the hm solutions for branch ii can be directly applied to those for branch i if we make the replacement @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "note that @xmath217 depends on @xmath28 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 , as well as @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the dependence on the model parameters becomes more complicated in branch i than in branch ii .",
    "throughout the paper , there appear many parameters which are denoted by various symbols . for convenience , we list some of them who play important roles in the table [ tab : symbols ] .",
