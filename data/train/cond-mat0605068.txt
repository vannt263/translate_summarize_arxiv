    "fabrication of micro- and nano - sized structures such as quantum dots , wires and rings has made it possible for physicists to examine new ideas in electronic devices .",
    "these small size devices act as artificial atoms with spectra and shell structures similar to those of real atoms@xcite .",
    "however it is possible to control the properties of these synthetic atoms in a way that is impossible with real ones .",
    "for example , a regular atomic orbital is three dimensional and one has limited control over the electronic wavefunction .",
    "in contrast , by controlling the shape of a quandum dot we can distort the wavefunction , controlling its polarizability and its interaction with adjacent dots . while the properties of periodic arrays of atoms are well understood in solid state physics , we have new playing field  periodic arrays of nanostructures  in which we have an unprecedented control of the `` atomic states . ''",
    "the focus of this paper is on the periodic one dimenstional ( 1d ) arrays of nano - rings .",
    "we chose this system for two reasons .",
    "first , quantum rings display interesting phenomena ( e.g. persistent currents@xcite . ) which are not found in dots .",
    "the basic difference between the ring geometry and a quantum dot is the excluded middle which confines the electron in a ring to a narrow spatially periodic channel .",
    "this compact , periodic geometry can allow dynamics not found in other systems.@xcite second , it has been become possible to create extremely small rings .",
    "these arrays of nano - rings can be fabricated either by dry etching @xcite or by using mbe techniques to foster self assembled ingaas / gaas rings .",
    "the size of these nano - rings is @xmath030  nm for outer radius and @xmath010  nm for inner radius for self - assembled ingaas / gaas rings @xcite .",
    "such techniques not only produce extremely small rings , they also make it easy to make _ periodic _ arrays of small rings .",
    "in this paper we consider an ideal array of 1d rings at zero temperature , each carrying a single charge .",
    "the rings are sufficiently close together that there is a coulomb interaction between the electrons , but separated enough so that the tunneling between rings can be neglected,@xcite as discussed in section [ sec : model ] . in section",
    "[ sec : classical ] we consider the classical case in section and see how different assumptions allow for symmetric or symmetry breaking ground states .",
    "section [ sec : quantum ] contains the main results of this work , where we show that there is a _ quantum phase transition _ in a 1d array of rings for @xmath1 .",
    "we show this both through monte carlo simulation of @xmath2d classical statistical respresentation of the problem as well as mapping it on to the 1d transverse field ising model .",
    "the polarization pattern is antiferroelectric . in section",
    "[ sec : bfield ] we examine how this transition is affected by magnetic fields .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] by summarizing results and discussing possible applications .",

    "we consider a one dimensional array of singly charged narrow quantum rings with radius @xmath5 and center - to - center separation of @xmath6 ( fig.[fig : ring1d ] ) .",
    "the width of each ring is much smaller than its inner radius so that we need only consider the one dimensional movement of the electron around the ring .",
    "while the rings are isolated from each other so there is no charge transfer between rings , the rings still interact electrostatically with their nearest neighbors.@xcite while in principle the coulomb interaction is long range , we assume that there is sufficient screening that next nearest neighbor interactions can be neglected",
    ".    we also neglect tunneling between rings .",
    "this is reasonable since the physical realizations discussed above produce rings that are not in tunneling contact .",
    "tunneling will be exponentially suppressed with @xmath6 , so that for spatially distinct rings it will be minimal .",
    "all the phenomena explained in this article only will appear in experiments if the electrons do not lose their quantum mechanical phase , i.e. the ring s perimeter has to be smaller than the electron s coherence length ( @xmath7 ) and the temperature has to be lower than the dephasing temperature ( @xmath8 ) . in each ring",
    "the confinement energy of the electron scales as @xmath9 ; this energy opposes localization of the wavefunction in the ring . the inter - ring coulomb repulsion , which scales as @xmath10 , tries to localize the wavefunction .",
    "electrons are repelled from regions of the ring where it is too close to the charges on neighboring rings .",
    "the competition between these two physical scales creates a _ quantum phase transition _ in the array from a localized state to extended state as we will see below .",
    "before solving a quantum mechanical problem it is often helpful to look at the similar classical case which is usually easier to solve . below we consider two classical models , one in which the classical charges are treated as ideal points , and the second in which they are treated as a continuous fluid .",
    "the classical model considers one charged point particle per ring with only nearest neighbor coulomb interaction . unlike the quantum mechanical case there is only one energy scale in the classical problem which is the coulomb energy @xmath10 .",
    "the energy of a 1d array is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the location of the @xmath13-th electron as measured from horizontal axis .",
    "in the dipole approximation we can write this as : @xmath14   \\nonumber \\\\   & = & { \\epsilon^2 e^2 \\over d}\\sum_i\\left[{\\vec s}_i\\cdot { \\vec s}_{i+1}+{3\\over 2}({\\hat d}\\cdot({\\vec s}_i-{\\vec s}_{i+1}))^2\\right ] .   \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a constant , @xmath17 . in the second expression",
    "we identify the position of each charge by a vector @xmath18 in the 2d plane pointing from the center of the @xmath13-th ring to the charge on that ring .",
    "the unit vector @xmath19 lies on the horizontal axis .",
    "the @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) term explicitly breaks the rotational symmetry , driving the system from xy to ising - like behavior .",
    "the heisenberg term in the last line of equation ( [ eq:1du ] ) drives the system ferroelectric at zero temperature while the second and larger term favors states where neighbors point in opposite direction .",
    "thus the system at zero temperature orders in an antiferroelectric ( afe ) pattern ( fig.[fig : ring1d ] ) in one dimension .",
    "our numerical monte carlo simulations of the exact coulomb interaction also verifies the existence of such a minimum energy configuration in the classical finite size arrays .    ) .",
    "scaling is required since the analytic result neglects all higher fourier modes .",
    "inset : a sketch of the charge distribution that corresponds to this fourier mode .",
    "note that the symmetry of the array is not broken by the charge distribution.,title=\"fig:\",width=326,height=259 ] +    we can examine the stability of the afe state by finding the higher energy modes of the system .",
    "we expand the energy function ( [ eq:1du ] ) to quadratic order in displacement angle around the afe configuration using @xmath22 .",
    "the afe configuration has a basis with two sites so we find two independent normal modes with frequencies : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "both the modes are gapped since the ising - like term provides the harmonic restoring force at each site .",
    "the modes are shown in fig.([fig:1dmodes ] ) .",
    "normal modes are found to be independent of the ring radius .",
    "another interesting classical limit of our ring problem is when there is a classical _ self - interacting _ fluid of charge on each ring while the nearest neighbor fluids are still interacting with each other . to find the minmum energy distribution of charge density on each ring we define an angular dependent charge density @xmath25 on each ring where:@xmath26 .",
    "we are looking for the minimal solution to the variational quantity : @xmath27 for a 1d ring this expression is divergent due to self energy .",
    "we can regularize this in several ways .",
    "one method is to introduce a short distance cutoff @xmath28 to the coulomb interaction , discretize the integral equation and then solve the problem numerically .",
    "an approximate analytic solution can then be obtained by fourier expanding the distribution , keeping only the first three modes .    for 1d array with periodic boundary condition",
    "we find that the amplitude of the non - trivial fourier mode as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath15 for @xmath29 is given by : @xmath30 we compare this analytic result with the numerical diagonalization of ( [ eq : fluid ] ) in fig.([fig : fluidplot1d ] ) .",
    "as we can see in fig.([fig : fluidplot1d ] ) the minimum energy configuration of the 1d array of charge fluid does not break the up - down symmetry of the system .",
    "at first glance the quantum mechanical wavefunction of a charged particle resembles the classical charge fluid .",
    "although the wavefunction does not have a self - interaction , the quantum particle has a kinetic energy which opposes localization , making the analogy to charge fluid even stronger . unlike the classical case , the quantum problem has two competing energy scales : the quantum kinetic energy , @xmath31 , preventing localization and the coulomb interaction energy , @xmath32 , trying to force the charges away from each other . at @xmath33",
    "we expect charge localization on each ring and at @xmath34 we expect no localization of charge .",
    "however it is not _ a priori _ obvious whether the charge localization ( system polarization ) breaks symmetry or not , whether this localization is a smooth function of the external parameters , and if it is a phase transition , what is the exact nature of this transition .      as a first step we can use a simple variational wavefunction to find the polarization behavior of the system in ground state .",
    "the dimensionless hamiltonian of an array of one dimensional rings with radius @xmath5 is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the interaction strength and the energy is measured in units of @xmath37 .    to find the ground state energy of the 1d array",
    "we employ a simple ansatz for the wavefunction of each sublattice : @xmath38 and @xmath39 alternately .",
    "the ground state values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is obtained by minimizing the energy ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) using dipole approximation for coulomb interaction we find : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where the critical value of the interaction is given by @xmath44 . to find out the degree of polarization we define the _ staggered polarization _ vector as : @xmath45 using variational results the staggered polarization of the system is as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the unit vector perpendicular to the common axis of the rings ( fig.[fig : ring1d ] ) and @xmath48 is defined in equation ( [ eq:1dalalytic ] ) .    as we can see",
    "variational calculation suggests that the ground state of the 1d array of rings antiferroelecrically polarizes in perpendicular direction at high interaction strengthes while at lower values the wavefunctions are not localized , hence the system has no polarization .",
    "the validity of this result will be confirmed in next sections using more exact and reliable methods of calculation .     in a 1d quantum ring array obtained in the hartree approximation .",
    "the numerical results are for the case include fourier modes @xmath49 ( triangles ) and @xmath50 ( boxes ) .",
    "the solid line is the analytic result assum- ing @xmath49 .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is a measure of the competition between the coulomb interaction and the quantum kinetic energy [ fig : hartree1d],title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +      the rings considered here are well separated with exactly one electron on each ring . under this condition and because of strong coulomb repulsion",
    "the effect of inter - ring transfer of electrons and overlap of wavefunctions is small .",
    "we can therefore neglect the inter - ring transfer from our calculations . since without overlap",
    "the electrons do not have any exchange interaction , the hartree approximation is exact for this problem.@xcite    we can decompose the wavefunction in each ring into a limited number of fourier modes , @xmath52 , and then solve the system numerically in the hartree approximation .",
    "we impose the periodic boundary conditions on the array and by an iterative self - consistent method we find the ground state wavefunction of the rings . in fig.([fig :",
    "hartree1d ] ) we can see the numerical results of the polarization and energy change of the 1d array of rings for different number of fourier modes using exact coulomb interaction and also its agreement with the variational calculation when we restrict the number of fourier modes to @xmath53 . the results are little changed when we increase the number of fourier modes mostly in the high coupling regime .",
    "all the above results suggest that there is transition from unpolarized to polarized state at zero temperature by changing the coupling . by looking at the behavior of polarization when the number of fourier modes increases",
    "we realize that this transition tends to be sharper and sharper for higher number of fourier modes suggesting a true phase transition in the system .",
    "if true , this transition would be a sudden change of ground state of the quantum system at zero temperature , known as _ quantum phase transition_.@xcite we demonstrate that this is the case and determine the universality class of the transition in the next section using the monte carlo simulation .",
    "it is well - known that we can write the quantum partition function of a quantum system , @xmath54 as the sum over all paths taken by the system in imaginary time defined by the scale @xmath55 .",
    "if the quantum system is d - dimensional then the partition function will look like the path integral of a d+1-dimensional classical system in which the extra dimension is the time direction @xmath56 . at zero temperature @xmath57",
    "the classical system is truly d+1-dimensional .",
    "one can derive an effective hamiltonian for such a classical system from the quantum hamiltonian using a complete set of basis states . in this classical system the parameters of the quantum system ( in our case @xmath51 ) is a control knob like temperature .",
    "we can use monte carlo simulation of such a classical system and find out the universal behavior of the quantum system .    to develop a 1 + 1-dimensional classical theory for our 1d ring array",
    "we first stagger the order parameter , @xmath58 so that we can analyze the monte carlo results easily .",
    "we also use dipole approximation for the coulomb interaction .",
    "consequently we can write the hamiltonian of the system as : @xmath59 in which @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "it can be shown that the field @xmath67 obeys the periodic boundary condition , @xmath68 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will also assume periodic boundary condition in space direction all over the simulation .    by defining the spin vector @xmath69 we can interpret eq.([eq:1 + 1d ] ) as a two dimensional classical spin model .",
    "our early calculations suggested that the system of 1d rings has a transition from the unpolarized to the afe state . in this classical analogue",
    "because we have already staggered the order parameter we expect to see a transition from unpolarized to ferromagnetically polarized state ( fe ) .",
    "close to this transition the spatial variation of the order parameter @xmath70 is smooth so we can approximate ( [ eq : pot ] ) as follows : @xmath71 using the above potential finally the classical partition function looks like : @xmath72 where i and j run over an infinite 2d square lattice and we have determined @xmath73 to identify the two couplings in eq.([eq:1 + 1d ] ) as @xmath74 . equation ( [ eq : apph ] ) is a 2d xy model with a symmetry breaking field which is @xmath75 the xy coupling .",
    "our monte carlo analysis shows that this model has a continuous phase transition .",
    "the order parameter of this system is the total magnetization density equivalent to the total staggered polarization of the 1d ring array : @xmath76 where the average on the left hand side is the thermodynamic average over the infinite size lattice .",
    "the fluctuations in this system is controlled by @xmath77 which is the analogue of @xmath78 in real classical systems .",

    "also an extrapolation of @xmath89 for different values of @xmath77 in fig.([fig : mextrapolate ] ) shows that a real continues phase transition happens in the infinite size system .",
    "the effective classical system derived here does not fully explain all the physical aspects of the 1d quantum system mainly because of the approximations used to derive the path integral .",
    "however , we believe that , close to the critical region , these approximations do not play any role in the general behavior of the system and the universality class remains unchanged . hence using the finite size scaling method we can determine the critical exponents of the classical system and determine the universality class of the actual quantum system .",
    "one of the best parameters for examining the phase transition and find the universal exponents with finite size scaling is the dimensionless binder ratio : @xmath90    = 1.45(empty boxes ) , 1.32(triangles ) , 1.03(polygons ) , 0.74(filled boxes ) , 0.45(stars ) and 0.16(crosses ) .",

    "for example at half filling , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 levels are degenerate unlike the case of zero magnetic field in which the ground state is unique and at @xmath168 . by adding the symmetry breaking term @xmath122 in the zero flux the electron gains enough energy to excite to the next higher level .",
    "this excitation causes the electron to destroy any localization in the range where @xmath126 is not strong enough yet .",
    "however when there is a finite magnetic field the @xmath20 can not lift the degeneracy between @xmath168 and @xmath169 levels in the range of small @xmath51 s .",
    "that is why in this case the ground state of @xmath123 remains degenerate(fig.[fig : enbplot ] ) .",
    "as long as @xmath51 is small the perturbative two body potential in ( [ eq : dipole+gauge ] ) can not excite the electron to higher levels and the kinetic energy of the electron freezes .",
    "when this happens the electrons behave classicaly and choose a wavefunction that minimizes the potential @xmath126 . in fig.([fig : bpotential ] ) we can see a 3d plot of the two body potential @xmath170 in which it has two stable minima at @xmath171 and @xmath172 indicating the preferred state of the quantum ring array at low @xmath51 being the ferreoelectric right or left state .",
    "it is surprising that the system orders ferroelectricallly along the chains .",
    "this occurs because the charge distribution is quite broad . using only the two lowest fourier modes the charge distribution can be written in general as @xmath173 , which nearly wraps around the ring . if we change this to an ( unphysical ) flat charge distribution with an artificially varying width , the fe state has a lower energy than the afe state when the width @xmath174 , while for a triangular distribution the fe distribution is favored when @xmath175 .",
    "while the exact transition depends of course upon @xmath132 , these calculations help explain why the fe phase wins out at half filling .",
    "in this paper we have shown that there is a phase transition in a periodic array of electrons each confined to a 1d ring .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 determines if the array will spontaneously polarize ; in 1d the transition is at @xmath176 .",
    "it is easy to achieve small values of @xmath51 simply by choosing the ring separation to be large .",
    "thus the  quantum \" limit where the kinetic energy dominates is simple to obtain . to obtain the antiferroelectrically ordered state we need large @xmath51 .",
    "we may write this as @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the bohr radius and @xmath179 is the effective mass of the electron . if @xmath180 and @xmath181 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 measured in nanometers , and @xmath182 , then @xmath183 .",
    "we require that the rings do not intersect , so that @xmath184 . thus the ability to achieve large values of @xmath51 in semiconductors will depend upon the value of the effective mass .",
    "if we set @xmath185 , then for gaas ( @xmath186 ) 1d arrays of rings with a radius greater than @xmath010 nm will be polarized .",
    "for alas ( @xmath187 ) the crossover radius is about 70 nm .",
    "rings with a smaller radius will not spontaneously polarize , but instead be isotropic    it is well known that in 1d there is no ordered state for @xmath188 for the ising model .",
    "however , for small arrays over finite time intervals the system can order . to observe this behavior",
    "we want the characteristic energies of the system to be greater than the temperature . for the coulomb energy @xmath189 , which we may write as @xmath190 where @xmath191 is in kelvin . for the kinetic energy this means @xmath192 ; if we measure @xmath193 in the same units .",
    "for gaas we can choose @xmath5 to be about 14 nm at 4k ; choosing materials with a smaller effective mass or going to lower temperature allows us to increase the radius .",
    "an afe polarized ring array will scatter light at a wavelength commensurate with the inter - ring separation , @xmath6 . in 1d",
    "there is a gap @xmath194 , which we may write as @xmath195 . for gaas rings with a separation @xmath196",
    "nm this gives @xmath197 .",
    "the 2d arrays have a similar sized gap at zone center , but the gap vanishes at one zone edge .",
    "the excitation spectrum can be probed optically , but scattering at the edge of the zone is difficult due to the constraints imposed by conservation of energy and momentum . typically in such cases raman scattering can be used to investigate the excitations .    while we have not explicitly addressed the 2d case here ,",
    "much can be gleaned from our results .",
    "the 2d classical problem obviously has a finite temperature phase transition , as shown by our monte carlo simulations .",
    "the 2d quantum problem can be mapped on to the 3d xy model , which is known to order .",
    "we have performed simulations on the 2d case and find that it orders in a striped phase.@xcite    finally these calculations assume that each ring is singly occupied .",
    "this might be obtained by fabricating the rings upon a thin insulating layer covering a gate . by tuning the gate voltage",
    "we can bias the system so that it is energetically favorable for an electron to tunnel to the rings .",
    "the gate will also serve to cutoff long distance interactions between the rings , supporting the assumption of the nearest neighbor interactions used here .",
    "moreover , this letter serves to start investigation into a broad class of problems , such as rings occupied by an optically excited exciton / hole pair or perhaps by a small , varying number of electrons created by a random distribution of dopants .",
    "the topic of quantum dot arrays and their correlations has obvious and useful analogies with solid state models of crystalline arrays of atoms . in this paper",
    "we wish to point out that experimentalists have at their disposal a host of `` unnatural atoms '' analogs : rings , quantum dot quantum wells , quantum rice , etc .",
    "the electrons in these nanoscale constituents are confined to orbitals that may not have atomic analogs .",
    "morever , it may be possible to tune the shape of the constiutent to optimize some desired collective property such as frustration in electric or magnetic polarization , high susceptibility or sensitivity to optical polarization of light",
    ". even more rich behavior will develop if we allow electrons to tunnel between these nanoscale periodic structures .",
    "the authors wish to thank steve girvin , herbert fertig , and matthew johnson for several useful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by nsf mrsec dmr-0080054 ( br ) , and nsf eps-9720651 ( km ) .",
    "in this section we explain how one can write the projection of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1dtfi ] ) into ground and first excited state subspace of @xmath123 as a 1d transverse field ising model ( eq.[eq : tfihamiltonian ] ) . in order to make the analysis easier we change the variables @xmath12 to staggered one , @xmath198 . defining @xmath199 and @xmath200 as ground and first excited states of @xmath123 and @xmath160 and @xmath201 the corresponding eigenenergies we can write the up and down states ( fig.[fig : pot ] ) as : @xmath202 and one can show that : @xmath203=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}.\\ ] ] so we can write the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1dtfi ] ) as : @xmath204 in which @xmath205 are spatial indices and : @xmath206 where @xmath207 and @xmath208 . to calculate matrix elements of the potential we use a simple numerical schrodinger equation solver to find the following quantities : @xmath209 in the above diagonal matrix elements of @xmath210 are approximately zero because must of the wavefunction is localized around @xmath211 .",
    "for the same reason the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath212 are @xmath213 . using the above we can derive the potential in the following second quantized form : @xmath214",
    "now we can use the holstein - primakov transformation @xcite to construct the following su(2 ) covariant operators for each lattice point : @xmath215 using the above definitions and the fact that : @xmath216 for each lattice point we arrive at the following expression for the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1dtfi ] ) : @xmath217 in which : @xmath218 .",
