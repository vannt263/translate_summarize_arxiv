    "a number of wide - field ground - based mm / submm imaging arrays have been commissioned during the past 15 years , including scuba @xcite , mambo @xcite , bolocam @xcite , sharc ii @xcite , apex - sz @xcite , laboca @xcite , act @xcite , and spt @xcite . since these cameras are operated at ground - based telescopes , they all see emission from water vapor in the atmosphere . in almost all cases ,",
    "the raw data from these cameras is dominated by atmospheric noise caused by fluctuations in this emission .",
    "all of these cameras make use of the fact that the atmospheric water vapor is in the near field , and therefore most of the fluctuations in the atmospheric emission are recorded as a common - mode signal among all of the detectors .",
    "most of the atmospheric noise can be removed from the data by subtracting this common - mode signal , and this method has been shown to be at least as effective as the traditional beam - switching or chopping techniques @xcite .",
    "however , this subtraction does not allow recovery of blip performance on scales where the atmospheric signal is largest ( _ i.e. _ , at low frequencies in the time - stream data ) . in the case of bolocam",
    ", the majority of the atmospheric fluctuations can be removed by subtraction of the common mode signal ; but the residual atmospheric noise still limited the sensitivity of our data , thus motivating further study of these atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "this study focused on two main topics : 1 ) determining the phenomenology of the atmospheric noise ( _ i.e. _ , could it be modeled in a simple and robust way ) and 2 ) finding more effective ways to remove the atmospheric noise based on this modeling .",
    "bolocam is a large format , millimeter - wave camera designed to be operated at the cso , and @xmath7 optical detectors were used for the observations described in this paper .",
    "cylindrical waveguides and a metal - mesh filter are used to define the passbands for the detectors , which can be centered at either 143 or 268  ghz with a @xmath8% fractional bandwidth .",
    "note that , for either configuration , the entire focal plane uses the same passband .",
    "a cold ( 4  k ) lyot stop is used to define the illumination of the 10.4  m primary mirror with a diameter of @xmath9  meters , and the resulting far - field beams have full - width half - maximums ( fwhms ) of 60 or 30 arcsec ( 143 or 268 ghz ) .",
    "the detector array , which utilizes silicon nitride micromesh ( spider - web ) bolometers @xcite , has a hexagonal geometry with nearby detectors separated by 40  arcsec , and the fov is approximately 8  arcmin .",
    "the optical efficiency from the cryostat window to the detectors is 8% at 143  ghz and 19% at 268  ghz ; at each frequency approximately half of the loss in efficiency is due to coupling to the lyot stop and half is due to inefficiencies ( reflection , standing waves , or loss ) in the metal - mesh filter stack . at 143",
    "ghz the typical optical load from the atmosphere is relatively small ( @xmath0  pw or 10  k ) , but the total optical load is @xmath10  pw ( 80  k ) , most of which is sourced by warm surfaces inside the relay optics box .",
    "the atmosphere contributes an optical load of @xmath11  pw ( 20 - 60  k ) per detector at 268  ghz , and there is an additional load of @xmath12  pw ( 40",
    "k ) due to the warm and cold optics . optical shot and bose noise contribute in roughly equal amounts to the total photon noise at each observing frequency , with the blip @xmath13  mk/@xmath14 ( 2.3  mk@xmath15/@xmath14 ) at 143  ghz and the blip @xmath16  mk/@xmath14 ( 4.5  mk@xmath15/@xmath14 ) at 268  ghz .",
    "is used throughout this paper to denote cmb temperatures ; all temperatures given without a subscript refer to rayleigh - jeans temperatures . ]",
    "more details of the bolocam instrument can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the data we describe in this paper were collected during three separate observing runs at the cso : a 40 night run at 143  ghz in late 2003 , a 10 night run at 268  ghz in early 2004 , and a 50 night run at 268  ghz in early 2005 . for the 143  ghz observations , we focused on two science fields , one centered on the lynx field at 08h49m12s , + 44d50m24s ( j2000 ) and one coinciding with the subaru / xmm deep survey ( sxds or sds1 ) centered at 02h18m00s , -5d00m00s ( j2000 ) .",
    "the 268  ghz observations were all focused on the cosmos field at 10h00m29s , + 2d12m21s ( j2000 ) .",
    "all three of these fields are blank , which means they contain very little astronomical signal .",
    "therefore , our data are well suited to measure the signal caused by emission from the atmosphere .",
    "to map these fields , we raster - scanned the telescope parallel to the ra or dec axis at 4 arcmin / sec for the 143  ghz observations and 2 arcmin / sec for the 268  ghz observations .",
    "] throughout this paper , we will refer to single scans and single observations ; a scan is one raster across the field and is @xmath8 seconds ( @xmath17 arcmin ) in length and an observation is a set of @xmath18 scans that completely map the science field , which takes @xmath12  minutes .",
    "our total data set contains approximately 1000 observations at each observing frequency , with the 143  ghz data split evenly among lynx and sds1 .",
    "flux calibration was determined from observations of uranus , neptune , and mars , and nearby quasars were used for pointing reconstruction .",
    "a more detailed description of the data is given in @xcite and @xcite .      since",
    "atmospheric noise from water vapor is generally the limiting factor in the sensitivity of broadband , ground - based , millimeter - wave observations , the premier sites for these observations , which include mauna kea , atacama , and the south pole , are extremely dry . on mauna kea",
    ", the cso continuously monitors the atmospheric opacity with a narrow - band , heterodyne @xmath19-meter that measures the optical depth at 225  ghz ( @xmath20 )  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath20 is a monotonically increasing function of the column depth of precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere , these @xmath20 measurements can be used to quantify the dryness of the atmosphere above mauna kea .",
    "historically , the median value of @xmath20 is 0.091 during winter nights , which corresponds to a column depth of precipitable water vapor of @xmath21  mm @xcite .",
    "the 25th and 75th centiles at mauna kea are 1.00 and 2.92  mm .",
    "note that the 25th , 50th , and 75th centiles of our data sets closely match these historical averages , so our data are a fair representation of the average conditions on mauna kea . for comparison , the median value of @xmath22 at the alma site in atacama is @xmath23  mm during winter nights , while the median value at the south pole is around 0.25  mm during the winter  @xcite .",
    "and opacity is different at the three sites due to the different atmospheric conditions at each location .",
    "see figure  [ fig : tau_vs_pwv ] . ]",
    "the k - t model of turbulence provides a good description of air movement in the atmosphere  @xcite . according to the model , processes such as convection and wind shear",
    "inject energy into the atmosphere on large length scales , of order several kilometers @xcite .",
    "this energy is transferred to smaller scales by eddy currents , until it is dissipated by viscous forces at kolmogorov microscales , corresponding to the smallest scales in turbulent flow and of order several millimeters for the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "for a three - dimensional volume , the model predicts a power spectrum for the fluctuations from this turbulence that is proportional to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a three - dimensional spatial frequency with units of 1/length .",
    "the same spectrum holds for particulates that are passively entrained in the atmosphere , such as water vapor  @xcite .    for our analysis",
    ", we adopted the two - dimensional thin - screen model described by @xcite , and a schematic of this thin - screen model is given in figure  [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "this model assumes that the fluctuations in water vapor occur in a turbulent layer at a height h@xmath26 with a thickness @xmath27h , where h@xmath28h .",
    "this layer is moved horizontally across the sky by wind at an angular velocity @xmath29 .",
    "given these assumptions and following the notation of @xcite , the three - dimensional kolmogorov - taylor power spectra reduces to @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the amplitude of the power spectrum at zenith , @xmath32 is the elevation angle of the telescope , @xmath33 is the two - dimensional angular frequency with units of 1/radians , and @xmath34 is the power law of the model ( equal to 11/3 for the k - t model ) . note that @xmath31 has units of mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 for @xmath35 .",
    "if the angular wind velocity , @xmath29 , is assumed to be constant and the spatial structure of the turbulent layer is static on the time scales required for the wind to move the layer past our beams @xcite , then detectors aligned with the angular wind velocity will see the same atmospheric emission , but at different times  @xcite . making reasonable assumptions for the wind speed ( 10  m / s ) and height of the turbulent layer ( 1  km ) yields an angular speed of approximately 30  arcmin / sec for the layer . note that this is much faster than our maximum scan speed of 4  arcmin / sec . since the diameter of the bolocam focal plane is 8  arcmin ,",
    "the angular wind velocity and spatial structures only need to be stable for a fraction of a second to make our assumption valid .",
    "to look for these time - lagged correlations , we computed the relative cross power spectrum between every pair of bolometers , described by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the relative cross psd between bolometers @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the fourier transform of the data time - stream for bolometer @xmath38 at fourier space sample @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the frequency ( in hz ) of sample @xmath41 .",
    "if two bolometers see the same signal at different times , then the cross psd of these bolometers will have a phase angle described by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the frequency in hz and @xmath45 is the time difference ( in sec ) between the signal recorded by the two bolometers .",
    "therefore , the slope of a linear fit to @xmath46 versus @xmath44 will be proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "if the simple atmospheric model we have assumed is correct , then @xmath47 should be a sinusoidally varying function of the relative angle on the focal plane between the bolometer pair , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the angular separation of the two bolometers ( _ i.e. _ , if one bolometer is located at position @xmath50 and another bolometer is located at position @xmath51 , then @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "some examples of @xmath54 versus @xmath48 are given in figure  [ fig : gamma_hist ] .",
    "in general , the model provides an excellent fit for roughly half of our data ( typically the data collected in better weather as quantified by the time - stream rms ) .",
    "the remaining data tend to contain several outliers and/or features in addition to the underlying sinusoid given by the model .",
    "the model fits also provide an estimate of the angular wind speed , with @xmath55 where @xmath56 arcsec for adjacent detectors on the bolocam focal plane .",
    "histograms showing the angular wind speed for all of our observations at both 143 and 268  ghz are given in figure  [ fig : wind_speed ] .",
    "note that the median angular wind speed is 31 arcmin / sec for the 143  ghz data and 35 arcmin / sec for the 268  ghz data , which is approximately what we expected for a physically reasonable model of the atmosphere .",
    "equation  [ eqn:2_d_atm_psd ] can be converted from a power spectrum in angular frequency space to a correlation function as a function of angular separation .",
    "since the power spectrum is azimuthally symmetric , we can write @xmath57 as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 . this power spectrum will produce a correlation function according to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the angular separation in radians , @xmath62 is the maximum length scale of the turbulence , and @xmath63 is the 0@xmath64-order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "to compare our data to this model , we calculated the correlation between the time - streams of every bolometer pair according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the correlation between bolometer @xmath38 and bolometer @xmath39 in mk@xmath1 , @xmath67 is the number of time - stream samples , and @xmath68 is the time - stream data for bolometer @xmath38 at time sample @xmath69 .",
    "a single correlation value for each pair was calculated for each @xmath8-second - long scan made while observing one of the science fields , and then averaged over the twenty scans in one complete observation of the field .",
    "therefore , we have assumed that the atmospheric noise conditions do not change over the @xmath12-minute - long observation and are independent of the scan direction , which is reasonable given that the typical angular wind speed is much larger than our scan speed .",
    "the @xmath66 were then binned as a function of angular separation between bolometer @xmath38 and bolometer @xmath39 to give correlation as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "ideally , we would like to compare our data directly to the theoretical model using equation  [ eqn : atm_corr ] .",
    "however , evaluating the integral in equation  [ eqn : atm_corr ] is non - trivial , especially when the effects of bolocam s finite beams , data processing , etc .",
    "are included .",
    "therefore , we have determined the theoretical correlation function based on the k - t model via simulation .",
    "first , we generate 50 two - dimensional projections ( _ i.e. _ , maps ) of the atmospheric fluctuation signal according to the power spectrum given in equation  [ eqn:2_d_atm_psd ] . in each of these realizations ,",
    "the phases of the different spatial frequency components are taken to be random .",
    "next , we convolve each map with the profile of a bolocam beam . then , we generate time - stream data by moving the atmospheric fluctuation map across our detector array at a rate given by the angular wind speed we calculated in section  [ sec : time_lag ] .",
    "these simulated time - streams are then processed in the same way as our real data , including removing the mean signal level from each @xmath8-second - long scan . finally , we determine the values of @xmath66 for the simulated data , averaging over all 50 realizations , and bin these @xmath66 as a function of bolometer separation .",
    "the shape of the theoretical @xmath70 determined from these simulations will depend not only on the value of the power law index , @xmath34 , but also on the height of the turbulent layer , @xmath71 .",
    "any reasonable value of @xmath71 will be in the near field for bolocam , so the physical size of the beam profiles ( in meters ) will be approximately independent of @xmath71 , which means that the angular size of the beams in the turbulent layer will be a function of @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , a change in the height of the turbulent layer will cause a change in the way that the angular emission profile of the atmosphere is smoothed by the bolocam beams , which will result in a different profile for @xmath70 .",
    "thus , in principle , our measured correlation profiles as a function of separation are sensitive to both @xmath34 and @xmath71 ( along with @xmath31 ) . however , as we explain below and show in figure  [ fig : power_law_hist ] , we obtain no meaningful constraint on @xmath71 because our measurement uncertainty on @xmath70 is large compared to the variations in @xmath70 with @xmath71 . initially , we assumed that both the height @xmath71 and the power law index @xmath34 were unknown , and ran simulations over a grid of values for each parameter . in our grid the values of @xmath34 ran from 2/3 to 20/3 in steps of 1/2 , and the values of @xmath71 were 375 , 500 , 750 , 1000 , 1500 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 , and 6000  m. note that we used an irregular step size for @xmath71 because the beam size is proportional to @xmath72 . since the computation time required for our simulation is substantial , we were only able to run the full grid of 121 different parameter values over a randomly selected subset of 96 143  ghz observations ( approximately 10% of our 143  ghz data ) .",
    "after computing the best fit value of @xmath31 for each observation and each grid point , we determined what values of @xmath71 and @xmath34 provided the best fit to the data .",
    "note that the data from adjacent bolometer pairs is discarded before fitting a model , due to the excess correlations between these pairs ( see section  [ sec : bolo_corr ] ) . additionally , the constraints on @xmath34 or @xmath71 for a single observation are not very precise because there is a wide range of combinations of @xmath34 and @xmath71 that will produce very similar model profiles .",
    "some examples of data with model fits overlaid are given in figure  [ fig : corr_plots ] .",
    "we found the average best fit value of the power law @xmath34 is 3.3 with a standard deviation of 1.1 , indicating that our data are consistent with the k - t model prediction of @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xcite previously found the atmosphere above the south pole to be consistent with the k - t model ( @xmath73 when only high signal to noise scans are included , @xmath74 when all scans are included ) using acbar data that was sensitive to much different physical scales in the atmosphere ( @xmath75  m beams and a @xmath76 deg fov ) .",
    "m in diameter and adjacent detectors are separated by 16 arcmin . as a result ,",
    "the typical separation between acbar beams is larger than the diameter of a single beam as they pass through the water vapor in atmosphere ( _ i.e. _ , each acbar beam passes through a different column of atmosphere ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath12 m primary at the cso and 40 arcsec separation between adjacent bolocam detectors means that there is significant overlap between the beams as they pass through the water vapor in the atmosphere . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : power_law_hist ] shows that the best - fit values of @xmath71 were uniformly distributed over the allowed range , indicating our data do not meaningfully constrain @xmath71 .",
    "we have so far assumed that the beams have a tophat profile while passing through the atmosphere .",
    "if the profile is not a tophat and/or varies among pixels , then our simulation will predict a @xmath70 that is too flat . however , given that the data are consistent with the k - t model prediction of @xmath35 , there is no indication that such an effect is significant .",
    "after showing that our data are consistent with the k - t model , we repeated the analysis of section  [ sec : time_inst_model ] for all of our data . for each observation we generated 50 simulated atmospheric noise maps with the value of @xmath34 fixed at 11/3 and the value of @xmath71 fixed at 1000  m. we set @xmath35",
    "because this is the power law predicted by the theory and is consistent with our data .",
    "the value of @xmath71 was chosen based on independent measurements of the water vapor profile above mauna kea ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite , estimated from hilo radiosonde data ) .",
    "note that our primary result , a measurement of the distribution of @xmath31 , does not depend strongly on the choice of @xmath71 because the best - fit value of @xmath31 is fairly insensitive to @xmath71 .",
    "over the physically reasonable range that we allowed in section  [ sec : time_inst_model ] ( @xmath77  m ) causes @xmath31 to vary by @xmath78% compared to the value of @xmath31 at @xmath79  m. this variation is comparable to the uncertainty in @xmath31 due to our flux calibration uncertainty .",
    "] for the 143  ghz data , the quartile values of @xmath31 are 100 , 280 , and 980  mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 , and for the 268  ghz data the quartile values are 1100 , 4000 , and 14000  mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 .",
    "note that the uncertainty in these values due to our flux calibration is approximately 12% .",
    "plots of the cumulative distribution function of @xmath31 at each frequency are given in figure  [ fig : cdf ] .",
    "a reasonable phenomenological expectation is that the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of water vapor are independent of the amount of water vapor ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath80 ) .",
    "since @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the emissivity of the atmosphere and @xmath83 is the brightness of the atmosphere in the rayleigh - jeans limit , this means that @xmath84 note that @xmath85 is the total opacity of the atmosphere at observing frequency @xmath86 . to test the validity of this expectation , we first considered the data in each observing band separately .",
    "the data sets for each observing band spanned a wide range of weather conditions , and in general our predicted scaling fit the data fairly well over the entire range .",
    "mm , and the value of @xmath87 varies by almost two orders of magnitude over this range of @xmath22 . ]",
    "see figure  [ fig : b_nu_vs_pw ] .",
    "additionally , we can test our assumption that @xmath80 by comparing the values of @xmath31 at 143  ghz to the values at 268  ghz . for our bands ,",
    "the median value of @xmath87 , based on the pardo atm model  @xcite , is approximately 16 times larger for the 268  ghz data compared to the 143  ghz data .",
    "the ratio of the values of @xmath31 for the two frequencies is 11 , 14 , and 14 for the three quartiles , indicating that most of the observed difference in @xmath31 between the two observing bands can be accounted for by assuming that @xmath80 .      at the south pole ,",
    "the median column depth of precipitable water vapor is @xmath88  mm , roughly @xmath89 times lower than the median value at mauna kea .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the atmospheric noise at the the south pole is expected to be much lower than the amplitude at mauna kea .",
    "using our data , along with acbar data collected at the south pole , we can make a direct comparison of the amplitude of the atmospheric noise between the two locations .",
    "acbar had observing bands centered at 151 and 282 ghz , very close to the bolocam bands , along with a third band centered at 222  ghz .",
    "for the 2002 observing season , @xcite determined that the quartile values of @xmath31 for the 151  ghz band are 3.7 , 10 , and 37  mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 , and the quartile values of @xmath31 for the 282  ghz band are 28 , 74 , and 230  mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the atmospheric noise is a factor of @xmath90 different for the bolocam and acbar bands at @xmath91  ghz , and a factor of @xmath92 different for the bands at @xmath93  ghz . additionally , the ratio of @xmath31 between bolocam and acbar is similar for all three quartiles in both observing bands , indicating that the relative variations in @xmath31 are comparable at both locations .",
    "see table  [ tab : noise_amp ] .",
    "our phenomenological expectation of constant fractional fluctuations in @xmath22 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath94 is on average the same at both locations ) implies that the ratio of @xmath87 should predict the ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "this prediction , again based on the pardo atm model  @xcite , is that the ratio of @xmath31 should be 12 for the @xmath91  ghz bands and 21 for the @xmath93  ghz bands . for each instrument for the median observing conditions at their respective sites .",
    "although the bolocam and acbar bands are similar , there are important differences ; not only are the bolocam bands centered at lower frequencies than the acbar bands , but the @xmath91  ghz bolocam band is significantly narrower as well . since the value of @xmath95 is in general a strong function of observing frequency , these subtle differences in the observing bands produce noticeable differences in the predicted value of @xmath31 .",
    "additionally , differences in the atmosphere above each location can cause significant differences in the value of @xmath95 for a given value of @xmath22 . specifically , the ratio of @xmath95 between bolocam and acbar is @xmath96 for the @xmath91  ghz bands and @xmath97 for the @xmath93  ghz bands . ] these predicted scalings are much lower than the observed scalings of 25 and 50 , indicating that the value of @xmath98 is a factor of @xmath99 lower at the south pole compared to mauna kea .",
    "consequently , in addition to the south pole being on average much drier than mauna kea , we conclude that the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of water vapor are also lower by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , because @xmath100 is a factor of @xmath99 larger at mauna kea compared to the south pole , and because the median value of @xmath101 is a factor of @xmath102 larger at mauna kea compared to the south pole , we find that @xmath31 is a factor of @xmath3 larger at mauna kea compared to the south pole for mm - wave observations .",
    "additionally , @xcite , using the results in @xcite , found that the value of @xmath31 is a factor of @xmath103 lower at the south pole compared to the alma site in atacama .",
    "therefore , we can infer that @xmath31 is a factor of @xmath104 lower at the alma site compared to mauna kea . since the value of @xmath87 is a factor of @xmath105 lower at the alma site than mauna kea for the median observing conditions at each location , we find that the value of @xmath100 is similar for mauna kea and the alma site . at the cerro chajnantor site under consideration for the cornell - caltech atacama telescope ( ccat )",
    "is approximately 0.83  mm , so the median value of @xmath31 should be about 30% lower at the ccat site compared to the alma site . ] therefore , the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of precipitable water vapor appear to be the same at mauna kea and the alma site , but they are significantly lower at the south pole ; these lower fluctuations at the south pole may be due to the lack of diurnal variations at that site .",
    "we emphasize that these are statements about the fluctuations in @xmath22 , and thus relate only to atmospheric noise . in shorter wavelength bands with higher opacity",
    ", it may be that signal attenuation and photon noise due to the absolute opacity are more important than atmospheric noise in determining the quality of a given site .      although it is useful to determine the amplitude of the fluctuations in atmospheric emission , the quality of our data is characterized by the residual noise level after removing as much atmospheric noise as possible .",
    "we will use the difference between the measured map variance , @xmath106 , and the expected map variance in the absence of atmospheric noise , @xmath107 , as a proxy for this residual noise level . note that these maps are produced after removing most of the atmospheric noise using the average subtraction algorithm given in section  [ sec : avg_skysub ] , and @xmath107 is estimated from the noise level of the map at high spatial frequency where the atmospheric noise is negligible .",
    "as expected , we find a correlation between @xmath108 and @xmath31 , although there is quite a bit of scatter in the amount of residual atmospheric noise for a given value of @xmath31 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : map_var ] .",
    "most of this scatter is likely due to the fact that the residual noise is inversely proportional to the amount of correlation in the atmospheric signal over our fov ; this correlation depends not only on the value of @xmath31 , but also on the the height and angular wind speed of the turbulent layer .",
    "since the atmosphere is in the near field for bolocam , an increase in the height of the turbulent layer reduces the overlap of the beams from individual detectors .",
    "thought of in a different way , a decrease in the height of the turbulent layer implies that the beam smoothing of the atmospheric signal is extended to larger spatial scales , making the atmospheric signal more uniform over the fixed angular scale of our fov .",
    "therefore , for a fixed value of @xmath31 , there will be less correlation in the atmospheric signal over the fov as the height of the turbulent layer increases .",
    "additionally , the angular wind speed of the turbulent layer will influence the amount of atmospheric noise in the data because our scan speed is much slower than the angular wind speed .",
    "this means that a higher angular wind speed will modulate the atmospheric noise to higher frequencies in the time - stream data ; at higher frequencies more of the atmospheric noise will be in our signal band and less of the noise will be removed using the subtraction algorithms described in section  [ sec : atm_noise_rem ] .",
    "also , note that , in the best conditions , our data approach the white noise limit , and these conditions can occur over a relatively wide range of values for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we find that while @xmath31 ( and also @xmath22 based on our assumption that @xmath109 ) is not a precise predictor of @xmath110 , there is a general trend of less residual map noise at lower values of @xmath31 ( @xmath22 ) .      in summary , the k - t thin - screen model appears to provide an adequate description of the atmospheric signal in our data .",
    "we find the angular speed of the thin - screen to be approximately 30 arcmin / sec , although roughly half of our data contain some features that can not be explained with a single angular wind velocity .",
    "the turbulent layer has a power law exponent of @xmath111 , consistent with the k - t prediction of @xmath35 . if we assume that @xmath112 , then the median amplitude of the atmospheric fluctuations is 280 mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 at 143 ghz and 4000 mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 at 268 ghz .",
    "these amplitudes are @xmath3 times larger than the amplitudes found at similar observing frequencies at the south pole using acbar  @xcite .",
    "most of the scaling in @xmath31 between observing frequencies and locations can be accounted for by assuming that the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of precipitable water vapor , @xmath94 , are constant .",
    "however , the data indicate that @xmath94 is a factor of @xmath4 smaller at the south pole compared to mauna kea .",
    "we thus find that the bulk of the reduction in atmospheric noise at the south pole is due to the consistently low value of @xmath22 at that site , and the lower fractional fluctuations in the precipitable water vapor only reduce the rms of the atmospheric noise by an additional factor of @xmath4 .",
    "additionally , after removing as much atmospheric noise as possible , we find a correlation between the value of @xmath31 and the amount of residual atmospheric noise in our data , although it is likely that the height and angular speed of the turbulent layer also influence the amount of residual atmospheric noise .",
    "in this section we describe various atmospheric noise removal techniques , including one based on the relatively unsophisticated common - mode assumption and several based on the properties of the atmospheric noise determined from our fits to the k - t model .",
    "additionally , we summarize the results of subtracting the atmospheric noise using adaptive principle component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "note that in this section , along with section  [ sec : resid_corr ] , our analysis focuses entirely on the 143  ghz data .      our most basic method for removing atmospheric noise is to subtract the signal that is common to all of the bolometers .",
    "initially , a template is constructed according to @xmath113 where @xmath69 is the sample number , @xmath114 is the number of bolometers , @xmath115 is the relative responsivity of bolometer @xmath38 , @xmath68 is the signal recorded by bolometer @xmath38 at sample number @xmath69 , and @xmath116 is the template .",
    "the relative responsivity is required to account for the fact that the bolometer response ( in nv ) to a given signal ( in mk ) is slightly different from one bolometer to the next .",
    "a separate template is computed for each @xmath8-second - long scan .",
    "after the template is computed , it is correlated with the signal from each bolometer to determine the correlation coefficient , with @xmath117 @xmath118 is the correlation coefficient of bolometer @xmath38 and @xmath119 is the number of samples in the @xmath8-second - long scan .",
    "next , the @xmath115 in equation  [ eqn : avg_template ] are set equal to the values of @xmath118 found from equation  [ eqn : skysub_corr ] , and a new template is computed .",
    "the process is repeated until the values of @xmath115 stabilize .",
    "we generally iterate until the average fractional change in the @xmath115s is less than @xmath120 , which takes five to ten iterations .",
    "if the @xmath115s fail to converge after 100 iterations , then the scan is discarded from the data .",
    "this algorithm generally removes the majority of the atmospheric noise , as shown in figure  [ fig : avg_skysub ] .      since the moving screen atmospheric model given in section  [ sec : time_lag ] provided a fairly good description of our data , we attempted to improve our atmospheric noise removal algorithm by applying the appropriate time delay / advance to every bolometer prior to average subtraction .",
    "the angular wind velocity for each observation was determined using the formalism described in section  [ sec : time_lag ] , and from this angular wind velocity we computed the time delay / advance for each bolometer based on its location on the focal plane . if the spatial structure of the atmospheric emission is static on the timescales of the delay / advance , then the shifted beam centers will be pointed at the same location in the turbulent layer for bolometers aligned parallel to the angular wind velocity . therefore , the atmospheric signal in these shifted time - streams will be identical for these bolometers , modulo uncertainties in the angular wind velocity , slight differences in the beam profiles , etc .",
    "see section  [ sec : time_inst_model ] for a discussion of the impact of the latter . for the typical angular speeds of the turbulent layer , the shifts are of order 1 sample , and we used a linear interpolation to account for shifts that are a fraction of a sample . note that this linear interpolation acts as a low - pass filter on our data ; to preserve the psds of our time - streams , we correct for this attenuation in frequency space . see appendix  [ sec : appen ] .",
    "we applied the appropriate shift to the time - stream of each bolometer before performing average subtraction , but this did not seem to reduce the post - subtraction noise psd relative to time - instantaneous average subtraction . see figure  [ fig : avg_skysub ] .",
    "therefore , we abandoned this atmospheric noise subtraction algorithm .",
    "based on the k - t model fits , we were able to determine which spatial fourier modes cause the atmospheric emission to become uncorrelated over our 8 arcmin fov .",
    "our time - stream psds show that most of the atmospheric noise signal is at frequencies below 0.1  hz , and the atmospheric noise becomes negligible at frequencies above 0.5  hz .",
    "therefore , most of the atmospheric fluctuations occur on long time - scales , which correspond to large spatial scales . to convert these temporal frequencies to angular frequencies , we divide by the the angular wind speed we determined for the thin - screen model , which we found in section  [ sec : time_lag ] to be approximately 30  arcmin / sec .",
    "this means that most of the atmospheric noise is at small angular frequencies with @xmath121  arcmin@xmath122 , and the atmospheric noise is negligible for angular frequencies larger than @xmath123  arcmin@xmath122 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that very little atmospheric signal is sourced by spatial modes with wavelengths smaller than our fov .",
    "note that @xcite , based on the atmospheric noise in scuba data and making reasonable assumptions for the height and angular speed of the turbulent layer , found a similar scale for the atmospheric fluctuations .    since most of the atmospheric signal is caused by power in spatial modes with wavelengths much larger than our fov , the signal will be slowly varying over our focal plane .",
    "therefore , we decided to model the atmospheric fluctuations using a low - order two - dimensional polynomial in detector position .",
    "this is similar to the method used by sharc ii to remove atmospheric noise  @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite attempted a similar planar subtraction with scuba , although with limited success .    for planar and quadratic subtraction , including the special case of average subtraction described in section  [ sec : avg_skysub ] ,",
    "the algorithm is implemented as follows .",
    "the data are modeled according to @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a vector with @xmath126 elements representing the bolometer data at time sample @xmath69 , @xmath127 is a diagonal @xmath128 element matrix with the relative responsivity of each bolometer , @xmath129 is an @xmath130 element matrix , and @xmath131 is a vector with @xmath132 elements .",
    "@xmath126 is the number of bolometers , @xmath69 is the sample number within the @xmath8-second - long scan , and @xmath132 is the number of fit parameters .",
    "@xmath129 is based on the geometry of the focal plane , with @xmath133 for average / planar / quadratic subtraction and @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are vectors with @xmath126 elements that contain the @xmath137 and @xmath138 coordinate of each bolometer on the focal plane .",
    "the @xmath131 are the @xmath132 atmospheric noise templates , which are obtained by minimizing @xmath139 with respect to @xmath131 .",
    "are not correlated with each other so that the covariance matrix is diagonal .",
    "the noises of the different bolometers are sufficiently similar , once corrected for relative responsivity via @xmath127 , that the noise covariance matrix can in fact be taken to be a multiple of the identity matrix .",
    "the @xmath140 statistic is thus proportional to a statistically rigorous @xmath140 , though it is not normalized correctly .",
    "the normalization is unimportant for our purposes .",
    "if these assumptions are incorrect , then our estimators of the atmospheric templates will not be minimum variance estimators ; they will , however , be unbiased .",
    "we also have implicitly assumed that we should determine @xmath131 at each point in time independently , which relies on the assumption that the intrinsic noise of a given bolometer is uncorrelated with itself in time ( _ i.e. _ , white in frequency space ) .",
    "this is also a reasonably valid assumption , and , again , if it is incorrect , then our estimators are not maximally efficient but remain unbiased . ] for a given time sample @xmath69 , the values of @xmath131 give the coefficients for each term in the polynomial expansion of the atmospheric signal over the focal plane at that particular time .",
    "a single element in the vector @xmath131 , when considered over all the samples in a scan , gives the time dependence of that particular coefficient .",
    "essentially , each element in @xmath131 can be thought of as a data time - stream that gives the amplitude of the atmospheric signal with a particular spatial dependence over the focal plane .",
    "minimizing equation  [ eqn : skysub_chi ] yields @xmath141 once @xmath131 is known , we can construct an atmospheric template analogous to equation  [ eqn : avg_template ] for each bolometer according to @xmath142 note that @xmath143 varies from bolometer to bolometer as prescribed by the assumed two - dimensional polynomial form and the best - fit polynomial coefficients @xmath131 .",
    "a correlation coefficient is then computed for each bolometer according to equation  [ eqn : skysub_corr ] , a new matrix @xmath127 is computed according to these correlation coefficients , and a new template is computed according to equations [ eqn : template_1 ] and [ eqn : template_2 ] .",
    "the process is repeated until the fractional change in the values of the correlation coefficients is less than one part in @xmath144 .    in general ,",
    "the psds of the higher - order templates are @xmath145 times smaller than the psd of the @xmath146-order template for bolometers halfway between the center and the edge of the focal plane .",
    "as expected , the ratio of the higher - order templates to the @xmath146-order template increases as the weather becomes worse .",
    "some typical power spectra of the @xmath147 are shown in figure  [ fig : skysub_templates ] .",
    "compared to average sky subtraction , a slight reduction in noise , most noticeable at low frequencies , can be seen in the time - streams .",
    "see figure  [ fig : avg_skysub ] . however , the difference in the noise level of a map made from co - adding all @xmath148 observations of the lynx science field is far more dramatic .",
    "see figure  [ fig : map_psd_ave_plane ] .",
    "the reason such a small change in the time - stream psds produces such a large change in the map psds is because planar and quadratic subtraction reduce the amount of residual atmospheric - noise correlations remaining in the time - streams of the bolometers .",
    "figures  [ fig : cross_psd_neighbor ] and [ fig : cross_psd_neighbor_2 ] illustrate this reduction in the bolometer - bolometer correlations with quadratic subtraction .",
    "however , the higher - order templates also remove more astronomical signal compared to average subtraction .",
    "therefore , a single observation of a given astronomical source shape will have an optimal subtraction algorithm based on the noise level of the data and the amount of signal attenuation .",
    "for an extended source , ( _ e.g. _ , a cmb anisotropy , which is usually modeled as flat in @xmath149 at large @xmath150 , where @xmath150 is angular multipole ) , we found that average subtraction was optimal for @xmath92% of the observations , planar subtraction was optimal for @xmath151% of the observations , and quadratic subtraction was optimal for @xmath9% of the observations .",
    "average and planar subtraction provide very similar sensitivity to a flat cmb power spectrum , likely because the cmb signal is nearly indistinguishable from the atmospheric noise signal for linear variations over our 8 arcmin fov .",
    "see figure  [ fig : map_psd_ave_plane ] . for point - like sources",
    ", we found that average subtraction was optimal for @xmath152% of the observations , planar subtraction was optimal for @xmath153% of the observations , and quadratic subtraction was optimal for @xmath154% of the observations .",
    "most observations were optimally processed with the same algorithm for both point - like and extended objects , indicating that weather is the primary factor in determining which subtraction algorithm will be optimal for a given observation .",
    "however , observations of point sources show a slight preference for planar and quadratic subtraction compared to extended sources .",
    "this is because the higher - order subtraction algorithms attenuate signal primarily on large scales , so extended objects are more sensitive to the signal loss caused by these algorithms .",
    "we have also used an adaptive pca algorithm to remove atmospheric noise from bolocam data  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this algorithm is to produce a set of statistically independent modes , which hopefully convert the widespread spatial correlations into a small number of high variance modes .",

    "is then formed from the eigenvectors according to @xmath164 this transformation matrix is used to decompose the data into eigenfunctions , @xmath165 , with @xmath166 these eigenfunctions are the time - dependent amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the time - stream data ; the eigenvalue @xmath159 is the variance of that time - dependent eigenfunction . at this point",
    ", we compute the logarithm for all of the eigenvalues , and then determine the standard deviation of that distribution .",
    "all of the eigenvalues with a logarithm more than three standard deviations from the mean are cut , and then a new standard deviation is calculated .",
    "the process is repeated until there are no more outliers with large eigenvalues .",
    "next , all of the eigenvector columns @xmath167 in @xmath163 that correspond to the cut eigenvalues are set to zero , yielding a new transformation matrix , @xmath168 .",
    "when reconstructing the data , setting these columns in @xmath163 equal to zero is equivalent to discarding the cut eigenvectors .",
    "finally , we transform back to the original basis , with the adaptive pca cleaned data , @xmath169 , computed according to @xmath170 in general , the eigenfunction , @xmath165 , corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is nearly equal to the template created for average sky subtraction .",
    "therefore , the physical interpretation of the leading order eigenfunction is fairly well understood .",
    "however , it is not obvious what signal(s ) the lower - order eigenfunctions correspond to .",
    "typically , adaptive pca only removes one or two eigenvectors from the 143  ghz data . in good weather ,",
    "adaptive pca produces slightly better time - stream noise psds than average subtraction , while average subtraction produces slightly better noise psds in bad weather .",
    "see figure  [ fig : avg_skysub_2 ] .",
    "however , adaptive pca attenuates much more signal than average subtraction at low frequencies , which means that average subtraction produces a better post - subtraction s / n compared to adaptive pca subtraction in all conditions . therefore , adaptive pca was never the optimal subtraction algorithm for our analysis of blankfield data .",
    "note that for observations of bright sources an iterative map - making technique can be used to recover a substantial amount of the signal that is lost in the process of subtracting the atmospheric noise @xcite .",
    "such flux recovery may change which subtraction algorithm that is optimal for a given observation .",
    "although none of our subtraction algorithms allow us to reach blip limited performance with bolocam below @xmath0  hz , this does not mean that blip performance is impossible from mauna kea .",

    "the initial subtraction of the spatial common mode signal was obtained by differencing detectors separated by @xmath10  arcmin and removed the atmospheric noise to within a factor of two of the instrument noise level below a couple hundred mhz .",
    "in addition , suzie i.5 had three observing bands ( 143 , 217 , and 269  ghz ) per spatial pixel , which allowed determination of the correlated signal over a range of frequencies .",
    "the remaining atmospheric noise at low frequency was removed down to the instrument noise level by subtracting this spectral common - mode signal .",
    "suzie ii was able to employ a similar subtraction method , using observing bands at 143 , 221 , and 355  ghz for each spatial pixel  @xcite . additionally , suzie ii had a much lower instrument noise level at 150  ghz compared to suzie i.5 , within 50% of the blip limit .",
    "similar to bolocam , suzie ii reached the instrument noise level at frequencies above a couple hundred mhz by subtracting a spatial common mode signal .",
    "however , by subtracting the spectral common mode signal , suzie ii achieved instrument noise limited performance below 100  mhz , and was within a factor of 1.5 of the instrument noise limit at 10  mhz . therefore , spectral subtraction of the atmospheric noise does provide a method to achieve nearly blip performance from the cso .",
    "the mkidcam cso facility camera , due to be deployed in 2010 , will make use of these lessons ; it will have 576 pixels each sensing 4 colors , thus providing the ability to perform both spatial and spectral subtraction of the atmospheric noise @xcite .    additionally , scanning the telescope more quickly can increase the amount of astronomical signal band that is free from atmospheric noise . as long as the telescope scan speed is slower than the angular wind speed of the turbulent layer",

    "there is a large excess correlation , above what is predicted by the k - t model of the atmosphere , between the time - streams of adjacent bolometers for 143  ghz bolocam observations .",
    "this excess correlation appears mainly at low frequencies in the time - stream data ( @xmath176  hz ) , and can be seen in the data in both of the following ways : 1 ) a residual offset between the correlation value for adjacent bolometers and the k - t model ( see figure  [ fig : corr_plots ] ) and as 2 ) a non - zero fractional correlation between adjacent bolometers after subtracting most of the atmospheric noise ( see figures  [ fig : cross_psd_neighbor ] and [ fig : cross_psd_neighbor_2 ] and table  [ tab : correlations ] ) . on average , this excess correlation between adjacent bolometers is @xmath99  mk@xmath1 for @xmath176  hz .",

    "the source of this correlated noise appears to be atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "in addition to the excess correlation between adjacent bolometers , there is also excess noise in the bolometer time - streams at low frequencies . after accounting for the electronics noise , photon noise , and atmospheric noise",
    ", there is an excess of @xmath10  mk@xmath1 for @xmath176  hz .",
    "this excess noise increases when the value of @xmath31 increases , so it also appears to be sourced by the atmosphere , and thus we interpret it as excess correlation at zero spacing that should be considered together with the excess correlation between adjacent bolometers .",
    "given this @xmath10  mk@xmath1 of excess low - frequency time - stream noise , we speculate that the @xmath99  mk@xmath1 of excess correlated noise between adjacent detectors is explained by the fact that adjacent detectors are separated by less than the smallest possible size of a spatial mode of the electromagnetic field ( em ) field that propagates through the optical system and arrives at the focal plane .",

    ", atmospheric noise and photon noise ( both the shot noise and wave noise terms ) will be correlated for pixels separated by @xmath5 .",
    "we discuss this correlated photon noise below . ]",
    "the 143  ghz bolocam optics provide a detector spacing of @xmath179 , compared to the diffraction spot size of @xmath6 , which means there will be significant correlations in the signal recorded by adjacent detectors . using the optical properties of the telescope and bolocam optics , along with the geometry of the focal plane",

    "the result is that approximately 50% of the 143  ghz power received by adjacent bolometers is completely correlated , which is what we observe in this excess low - frequency noise .",
    "although this excess noise appears to be caused by atmospheric fluctuations , we do not have an adequate model to explain its source .",
    "the excess noise appears in single detector time - streams ( along with adjacent detectors for the reasons argued above ) , which means it must be localized to a single beam .",
    "additionally , since the noise appears at low frequencies in the time - streams , it must be sourced by fluctuations larger than @xmath172  arcmin .",
    "arcmin / sec , noise appearing below 1  hz must be sourced by modes larger than @xmath172  arcmin . ]",
    "but , the bolocam beams for adjacent pixels are only separated by 40  arcsec ; dozens of pixels are separated by less than @xmath172  arcmin .",
    "therefore , fluctuations with an angular size of @xmath172  arcmin will cause correlations between a large number of bolocam detectors , not just adjacent ones .",
    "an alternate explanation is motivated by the fact that the median amount of excess low - frequency noise ( @xmath10",
    "mk@xmath1 ) is much less than the total amount of atmospheric noise in the bolocam data below 1  hz ( @xmath180  mk@xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , this excess noise could be explained by atmospheric fluctuations at a reasonable height if there is an optical non - ideality that couples @xmath181% of the beam to the atmosphere in a manner that is uncorrelated across the array , excluding the adjacent bolometer correlations discussed above .",
    "this excess correlated noise is difficult to remove because it is only correlated among bolometers that are close to each other on the focal plane .",
    "we have attempted to remove this noise by constructing localized templates using the data from a bolometer and the @xmath182 bolometers that are adjacent to it on the focal plane .",
    "we have removed these localized templates from the data both before and after applying our atmospheric noise removal algorithm to the data . unfortunately , subtracting these templates from the data resulted in an unacceptable amount of signal attenuation , and not all of the locally correlated noise was removed .    additionally , as a consequence of the bolocam detector spacing , we expect the atmospheric photon noise will also be @xmath92% correlated between adjacent detectors .",
    "since the photon noise has a white spectrum , these correlations will have a larger effect at high frequencies in the time - stream data where there is almost no contamination from atmospheric noise .",
    "for bolocam , the median white noise of 5  mk@xmath1/hz is composed of 2.5  mk@xmath1/hz of detector plus electronics noise and 2.5  mk@xmath1/hz of photon noise . at frequencies above 2.5 hz ,",
    "well above the sky noise , the median correlation between adjacent bolometer time - streams is 5% , which means the median correlated noise is @xmath183  mk@xmath1/hz . as mentioned above , em - field overlap between adjacent pixels implies that 50% of the photon noise should be correlated , yielding an expectation of 1.3  mk@xmath1/hz of correlated white noise , roughly 4 times the observed value .",
    "we speculate that this deficit of correlation in the photon noise is explained by the fact that high - angle scattering to warm surfaces in the relay optics is the dominant source of optical loading .",
    "such scattering does not necessarily preserve the correlation of the em - field between adjacent pixels in the way that it is preserved for the transmitted beam .",
    "the em - field correlations between adjacent pixels are only guaranteed to be preserved for the 10% of our optical loading that is received from the atmosphere via the transmitted beam . however , we caution that we have no positive evidence supporting this scattering hypothesis for the observed deficit of correlated photon noise between adjacent detectors .",
    "finally , our hypothesis of em - field overlap between adjacent detectors implies that the atmospheric noise will also be @xmath92% correlated between adjacent detectors as a result of our spacing .",
    "however , since most of the fluctuation power in the atmosphere is at large scales , the atmospheric noise in these detectors is already highly correlated .",
    "therefore , the excess adjacent bolometer correlations will only appear in the atmospheric noise that the k - t model predicts will be uncorrelated ( _ i.e. _ , the difference between the k - t model prediction for adjacent bolometers and bolometers with zero separation ) .",
    "the median amount of noise predicted by the k - t model to be uncorrelated between adjacent bolometers is @xmath184  mk@xmath1 , which means there will be @xmath185  mk@xmath1 of correlated noise between adjacent bolometers that is not predicted by the k - t model .",
    "this means that the atmospheric noise will only cause an excess correlated noise signal of @xmath185  mk@xmath1 between adjacent detectors .    in summary",
    ", there is an excess noise that appears at low frequencies in the bolocam time - stream data .",
    "the amount of excess noise depends on the amplitude of the atmospheric fluctuations , and it is approximately @xmath92% correlated between adjacent detectors .",
    "we hypothesize that this correlation is due to the em - field overlap engendered by the geometry of the optical system and the physical separation between adjacent detectors .",
    "the available evidence suggests that this excess noise is due to the atmosphere , but we emphasize that we do not have a physical model to explain it , nor do we have direct evidence for our em - field overlap hypothesis .",
    "ideally , the noise in our data would be uncorrelated between bolometers and have a white spectrum .",
    "this is approximately what we would expect if instrumental or photon noise was the dominant source of unwanted signal in our data time - streams .",
    "however , our data contains a significant amount of noise with a rising spectrum at low frequency .",
    "some of this noise is due to residual atmospheric noise , and some is due to the excess low frequency noise described in section  [ sec : bolo_corr ] . as mentioned in section  [ sec : bolo_corr ] , the excess low frequency noise ( along with some residual atmospheric noise and photon noise ) is highly correlated among adjacent bolometers .",
    "additionally , there are correlations between all bolometer pairs on the focal plane due to the residual atmospheric noise .",
    "finally , the atmospheric template used in our subtraction algorithms is constructed as a superposition of all the bolometer time - streams , so removing this template from each bolometer time - stream will cause it to be slightly correlated with every other bolometer time - stream . to understand how these non - idealities affect our data , we have generated two sets of simulated data .",

    "at high spatial frequency ( @xmath187 ) , the simulated data sets produce noise levels that are similar to our actual data , which implies that the correlations between detectors occur at low frequency and are caused by the atmospheric noise .",
    "however , both simulated data sets have a much lower noise level than our actual data at low spatial frequencies . to quantify the difference between the simulated data sets and our actual data set , we have estimated the uncertainty in determining the amplitude of a flat cmb power spectrum ( see @xcite for details of the calculation ) .",
    "additionally , we estimated the uncertainty in determining the amplitude of a flat cmb power spectrum for the data set that contains our actual data for 36 detectors .",
    "this uncertainty was multiplied by 36/115 to account for the degradation caused by masking off 79 detectors .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : sim_noise ] .",
    "the simulated data indicate that our uncertainty on the amplitude of a flat cmb power spectrum would be improved by a factor of @xmath188 if the detector time - streams were uncorrelated , and by another factor of @xmath189 if the time - streams had a white spectrum instead of a rising spectrum at low frequency due to the residual atmospheric noise .    additionally , after correcting for the loss of 79 detectors , the data set with 36 detectors produces a similar result to the simulated data set based on our actual noise spectra .",
    "this indicates that the correlations between time - streams of non - adjacent bolometers are negligible .",
    "the implication is that , if we had used larger horns ( in @xmath190 ) while maintaining the same number of detectors , we would have improved our sensitivity in @xmath191k@xmath192 by a factor of 1.6 . by going to larger horns",
    ", we would also have had a larger fov , which would have had both positive ( _ e.g. _ , sensitivity to larger scales ) and negative ( _ e.g. _ , less uniform map coverage ) effects on our data . ) , the correlation over an 8 arcmin subregion of the fov would be approximately equal to what we observed . therefore , similar atmospheric noise removal could be obtained by performing the atmospheric noise subtraction algorithms on subregions of the larger fov and/or subtracting higher - order polynomials . ]",
    "it seems likely that these negative effects would have been small compared to the large gain in sensitivity we would have obtained by eliminating the excess correlations between adjacent bolometer time - streams .",
    "another implication is that , at fixed detector count , it is more advantageous from the atmospheric noise point - of - view to use @xmath193 pixel spacing and increase the fov than it is to hold the fov fixed and sample it more finely with @xmath194 pixel spacing . increasing the bolocam fov was not possible by the time this effect was observed , but this lesson is being applied for mkidcam .",
    "we have studied the atmospheric noise above mauna kea at millimeter wavelengths from the cso using bolocam . under all observing conditions , the data time - streams are dominated by atmospheric noise at frequencies below @xmath0  hz .",
    "the data are consistent with a k - t turbulence model for a thin wind - driven screen , and the median amplitude of the fluctuations is 280  mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 at 143  ghz and 4000  mk@xmath1 rad@xmath2 at 268  ghz . based on a comparison to the acbar data in  @xcite , we conclude that these atmospheric noise fluctuation amplitudes are a factor of @xmath3 larger than they would be at the south pole for identical observing bands .",
    "this large difference in atmospheric noise amplitudes is due primarily to the south pole being a much drier site than mauna kea , with a small factor of @xmath99 arising from the fact that the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of water vapor are a factor of @xmath4 lower at the south pole .",
    "based on our atmospheric modeling , we developed several algorithms to remove atmospheric noise , and the best results were achieved when we described the fluctuations using a low - order polynomial in detector position over the 8  arcmin focal plane .",
    "however , even with these algorithms , we were not able to obtain blip performance at frequencies below @xmath0  hz in any observing conditions .",
    "therefore , we conclude that blip performance is not possible from mauna kea below @xmath0  hz for broadband @xmath174 mm receivers with subtraction of a spatial atmospheric template on scales of several arcmin .",
    "we also observed an excess low - frequency noise that is highly correlated between detectors separated by @xmath5 ; this noise appears to be caused by atmospheric fluctuations , but we do not have an adeqaute model to explain its source .",
    "we hypothesize that the correlations arise from the classical coherence of the em field across a distance of @xmath6 on the focal plane .",

    "in order to account for the time lags and advances between bolometer time - streams that are described by the k - t thin - screen model , we in general have to shift the time - streams by a fractional number of samples .",
    "for example , if a given bolometer time - stream is advanced by @xmath195 seconds , then we will account for this advance by shifting the time - stream according to @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the interpolated data time - stream , @xmath198 is the original data time - stream , @xmath45 is the time between samples , and @xmath69 is the sample number .",
    "note that we have assumed that @xmath199 , since shifts by integer multiples of @xmath45 are trivial .",
    "alternatively , this shift can be performed in frequency space by applying @xmath200 to the fourier transform of the time - stream data , where @xmath42 is frequency in hz and @xmath41 is the frequency - space index .",
    "@xmath201 acts like a filter , and , for all non - zero frequencies , @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , to preserve the noise properties of our data , we divide the fourier transform of the shifted time - stream by @xmath203 . in summary",
    ", we shift the time - stream data according to equation  [ eqn : das_shift ] , then correct for the filtering effects of this shift in frequency - space by dividing by @xmath203 .",
