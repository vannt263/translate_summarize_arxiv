    "the recently undertaken extensive experimental searches for baryon states that can not be constructed with triplets of u , d and s quarks ( exotic states ) seem to have revealed significant positive results @xcite .",
    "consequently , the models predicting baryon states constructed out of more complicated quark configurations have been brought into focus .",
    "the most popular recent models are the chiral soliton @xcite and @xmath7 strong color - spin correlated models @xcite .",
    "both models have fixed the scale by using the mass of the non - strange member of the pentaquark anti - decuplet , and octet @xmath8 anti - decuplet configurations as the input .",
    "the first , chiral soliton model @xcite , has assumed that the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance exists , and has used its the mass as a scaling value for their non - strange pentaquark state .",
    "after the discovery of the @xmath9 exotic state , the authors have improved the original model . in the original paper by diakonov et.al .",
    "@xcite the pdg n(1710 )  p@xmath0 has been directly identified as the member of the pentaquark anti - decuplet , and the model predictions for the partial width of that state have been compared with the experimentally established ( pdg ) values . in spite of the achieved reasonable agreement , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have left the possibility of simultaneous existence of two nearby 1/2@xmath10 resonances open , and justified it by referring to the findings of a possible degeneration of the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state made in the coupled channel multi - resonance pwa done by zagreb group @xcite .",
    "as the exotic pentaquark states seemed to be confirmed , and the original identification of the cryptoexotic 1/2@xmath10 state with the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance does not seem to pass the theoretical scrutinization  @xcite , the search should be continued to find a signal for the new 1/2@xmath10 anti - decuplet resonance corresponding either to the n(1646 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ( which in that model mixes with the n(1440 ) , @xmath11(1600 ) , @xmath12(1660 ) and @xmath13(1690 ) octet ) or to the n@xmath14(@xmath151700 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases the standard n(1710 )",
    "p@xmath0 pdg - resonance belongs to a pure n(1710 ) , @xmath11(1810 ) , @xmath12(1880 ) and @xmath13(1950 ) octet , and exhibits no mixing with the pentaquark anti - decuplet . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 strong color - spin correlated model @xcite has fixed its scale by identifying the the first - ( @xmath16 ^ 2 \\bar{s}}$ ] ) state as @xmath9 , the second - ( @xmath16 ^ 2 \\bar{d}}$ ] ) state as n(1440)-roper resonance , and the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state is identified with the third - ( @xmath16 [ su]_+ % % @ \\bar{s}}$ ] ) hidden strangeness state n@xmath14 .",
    "contrary to the fact that the exotic states can be unambiguously experimentally confirmed , the distinction between any three quark baryon state and a non - strange pentaquark configuration is a completely open , model dependent problem .",
    "namely , the pentaquarks , @xmath17(1540 ) and @xmath18(1862 ) consist of solely of a @xmath6 wave function because a wave function does not produce baryons with their quantum numbers . as we may write down the fock space expansion of any / each baryon as a linear combination of @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , we are left with a problem of defining a criteria to distinguish between a three quark state with the diquark contribution coming from the sea quarks , and the genuine pentaquark states .",
    "it can be done only by comparing the experimentally established characteristics of the resonant state with the corresponding values coming from the @xmath5 and @xmath6 model predictions , and defining some selection rules @xcite .",
    "it is completely clear that we can only give a positive hint that a state is a pentaquark state , and not a definite proof .",
    "the analysis of the p@xmath0 resonant structure in the whole energy range , consequently , becomes the issue of prime importance .",
    "this study is motivated by the search for a non - strange partner of the exotic pentaquark @xmath9 state .",
    "since the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state is one of such candidates its properties are of prime interest .",
    "let us point out that the extraction of the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance parameters from experiment is very important even if the existence of @xmath9 state would not be confirmed in future because of variety of other issues related to the analytic structure of pion - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "we shall approach this problem by trying to understand the origin of the prominent , and quite narrow peak in the total cross section data which is not yet fully understood .",
    "simple breit - wigner resonance models using the pdg parameters @xcite and the more sophisticated coupled - channel models @xcite do give certain level of peaking around 1700 mev , but far from enough as indicated by data . in this paper",
    "we give a mechanism how the structure of the data ( strong peaking of the total cross section data of @xmath19 900 mb ) can be accounted for in details without disturbing measured observables elsewhere .",
    "we show that it is necessary to increase the branching ratio of the p@xmath0 resonance to the @xmath20 channel simultaneously with reducing the n(1710 )",
    "p@xmath0 total width , but then the agreement of the model predicted total cross section at energies of w @xmath15 1750 mev is significantly spoiled .",
    "one way out is to allow for the existence of the second resonant state which we identify to be as well in the p@xmath0 partial wave .",
    "the functioning of the mechanism is demonstrated in a simple breit - wigner resonance model , but we expect it to work when extended to a coupled channel calculation .    in our simple breit - wigner resonance model",
    "we are focused to the cross section data only , but as a comparison we show the model predictions for the longitudinal polarization data as well .",
    "that aspect of our publication requires an additional discussion .",
    "as it is well known , even the elastic channel polarization data are presently hard to be understood , and the need still exists to create an `` improved program ' a la kh80 which also gives good results for spin rotation data above 1 gev and large angles '' @xcite .",
    "so it is no miracle that our simple breit - wigner resonance model quite poorly reproduces the longitudinal polarization @xmath20 data .",
    "it better be so , because otherwise no one would believe that our calculation is correct .",
    "this paper relies upon the belief that something else , and not reproducing the data is important : the same pattern of behavior , seen in cross section data , is followed for polarization as well .",
    "namely , i ) model based on the standard type of p@xmath0 resonance ( branching ratio @xmath21 - 30 % , partial width @xmath15 100 - 200 mev ) only tolerably reproduces the data ; ii ) the modification ( reduction ) of @xmath20 partial width required for reproducing the 1700 mev peak in the total cross section spoils the level of agreement of the breit - wigner resonance model with experiment ; iii ) the addition of a second resonance in that energy range restores the agreement of model predictions for longitudinal polarization to the initially achieved level .",
    "our intention in case of polarization is not to discuss the level of consistency with experiment , but the dynamics of the procedure : if one wants to improve on one part , something else is spoiled , so a new mechanism ( a new resonance in our case ) is needed to repair the damage .",
    "this paper contains : the detailed explanation of the prominent , and yet not fully understood total cross section peak in the process @xcite in terms of sometimes questioned n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance @xcite and another , not yet discussed p@xmath0 resonant state ; the discussion of the proper interpretation of these states upon its acceptance ; and finally advocating new experiments in order to improve the experimental situation in the channel which is the most sensitive process for analyzing the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance .",
    "the problem of the width of the p@xmath0 resonant state will be addressed in particular . as the width of the physical n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state is fairly undetermined ( @xmath22  mev ) - @xcite and quark models predict different ranges for the p@xmath0 width ( of the order of 200  mev for the standard three quark models , and of the order of 40  mev for the pentaquark models ) , we wonder if it is possible that the observed physical state is the admixture of both , three quark and a pentaquark states .    an attempt of finding the new 1/2@xmath10 state has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was based on admixing an additional narrow 1/2@xmath10 resonance to the gwu pwa of ref .",
    "@xcite in a way to make a standard pwa sensitive to narrow resonances .",
    "it has revealed two possible candidates for a new 1/2@xmath10 state at 1680 and 1730 mev .",
    "without the @xmath20 data even the sole existence of n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance is seriously questioned in the energy - dependent coupled - channel chew - mandelstam k matrix analysis @xcite . however , due to the constraints coming from the crossed channels , the fully analytic karlsruhe - helsinki pwa @xcite undoubtedly sees it , and qualifies it as being strongly inelastic . very little doubt about its existence is left when the inelastic data are included in the analysis .",
    "the coupled - channel t - matrix carnegie - mellon berkeley ( cmb ) type models report it and claim that it is strongly inelastic @xcite .",
    "the coupled channel k - matrix analyses ( university of giessen ) agrees with the existence of the n(1710 ) p@xmath0 state , but the status of its importance for the process varies from important @xcite to dominant @xcite .",
    "another coupled channel k - matrix analyses @xcite also reports the n(1710 ) p@xmath0 state as one of the important contributions , but does not offer the separation into individual resonance contributions so we have no information about its relevance in that model .    putting aside the fact that the problem of identifying resonances seems to be more of fundamental then of technical nature pole in the energy range where the energy - dependent coupled - channel chew - mandelstam k matrix method does not see anything , when fitting the identical set of single energy t - matrices .",
    "it has been explicitly concluded that the differences in pole structure in the two afore described models arise from the different parameterization of the energy dependence , rather than differences in the data .",
    "the answer to this puzzle is yet to be given , but it is conceivable that the used number of channels is insufficient , and that more rigorous inclusion of @xmath20 channel is needed . ]",
    "it is important to stress that the very strong peak , formed when the @xmath15 1700 mev data points from refs .",
    "@xcite are taken seriously , is not reproduced in any of these models .",
    "all models do see the peaking structure , but is definitely too low .",
    "no attempts have been made in these models to give a physical explanation about what is the possible physical origin of a serious underestimation of the peak value ( @xmath15 70 % ) .",
    "our intention is to show how it can be accounted for in a simple breit - wigner resonance model .",
    "the experimental data sets for the process are available for quite some time @xcite .",
    "the total cross section data clearly show a distinct structural behavior in the vicinity of 1700 mev and the differential cross sections @xcite show a clearly recognizable linearity in cos@xmath23 up to 1850 mev .",
    "as the experiments admit the systematic error of 8 - 15 % in absolute normalization , the observed structure is smeared in energy making any conclusions about the profile of the structure very difficult .",
    "even when the agreement about the position and the width of the structure is achieved , the interpretation of its origin remains unclear .",
    "it can be interpreted either as a genuine t - matrix pole , namely the signal of a resonance , or as a cusp effect resulting from the opening of the @xmath24 channel .",
    "the distinction between the resonant and the cusp effect interpretations is as well non - trivial . to claim that the structure is a genuine t - matrix pole requires a full scale coupled - channel analysis which manifestly incorporates the appearance of cusp effects , and a clear and unambiguous search for the poles in the complex energy plane via well defined analytical continuation .",
    "anything less ( argand diagrams , fits to different single - resonance models , .. ) fails on the basis of first principles as it has been demonstrated in the search for the dibaryon resonance hidden in the @xmath25d@xmath26 and @xmath27f@xmath28 partial waves in the pp @xmath29 pp elastic scattering @xcite . partly because of data dissipation , and partly because of technical complexity , the process has not yet been included as the part of the data base in the existing coupled - channel @xmath30-nucleon partial wave analyses ( pwa ) @xcite until late 90-es @xcite , and even then , according to the authors themselves , play a minor role because of large errors and are included for completeness only .",
    "the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance parameters have been for the first time extracted from the data in a single - channel energy - dependent phase shift analysis @xcite , which was soon afterwards upgraded using the new set of data @xcite . because of using only one channel , the extracted resonances for the s@xmath0 , p@xmath0 and p@xmath1 partial waves do not necessarily describe all @xmath30-nucleon channels at the same time , so the single - channel result should be coordinated with the values obtained in the multi - channel pwa .",
    "that has been attempted in ref .",
    "in this article we only use a simple s - channel breit - wigner resonance model with no background and no t - channel contributions taken into consideration .",
    "this is a very strong simplification of reality , but we do believe that the main conclusions of the paper are of qualitative and not of quantitative nature , and that such a simple model suffices . for getting the proper quantitative answers the full coupled channel calculation will be undertaken in near future .",

    "+ the t - channel resonant contribution of @xmath57(892 ) meson is in this calculation neglected , because the product of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 coupling constants , which enters the model , is poorly determined , and due to the kinematic behavior of the @xmath57(892 ) propagator influences the shape of the differential cross section significantly only at energies far above the domain of interest of 1650 - 1750 mev @xcite .",
    "the square root recipe for the @xmath60 matrix is generally valid in a single resonance approximation , but is believed to be a fair approximation within a resonance energy domain for any full calculation .",
    "therefore , the use of a breit - wigner resonance model should be sufficient to establish the relevant resonance parameters near the top of the resonance .",
    "the collection of data sets which we have used for a comparison with the predictions of our model @xcite declare an 8 - 15 % systematic error in the absolute normalization , therefore an overall normalization of absolute scale is in order .",
    "the smearing of the structure in the total cross section , due to the normalization uncertainties in the reported experiments has been lessened by creating the amalgamated data set . because three out of four experiments @xcite report the peak of 920 @xmath61b at the energy of 1694  mev , we have chosen to normalize all data accordingly . in addition , we have shifted the whole knasel et al .",
    "data set @xcite up in energy for 9 mev .",
    "that step is open for criticism because it implicitly questions the energy calibration of that particular experiment .",
    "that is not our intention . at this point , we are primarily interested in the shape of the structure , namely its width , because we tend to interpret it as a possible narrow non - strange pentaquark candidate .",
    "the mass of the resonance is not of our prime concern . by shifting the peak of the structure to the same energy we automatically extract the common width from all experiments , because otherwise the width is smeared and comes out bigger then actually extracted from each experiment separately .",
    "we could have shifted other three experiments 9 mev down in energy and obtain the same width , but lower mass .",
    "the breit - wigner resonance model calculation has been repeated using the standard set of parameters for the n(1650 )  s@xmath0 , n(1710 )  p@xmath0 and n(1720 )  p@xmath1 resonances of ref .",
    "@xcite , the parameters are given in table 1 denoted as `` pdg '' , and the agreement with experiment is given in figures [ fig:1 ] through [ fig:3 ] as thin solid line .",
    "that choice of parameters gives the overall reproduction of the absolute value of the total cross section , and manages to reproduce the shape of the angular distribution only at w=1683 mev .",
    "however , it fails miserably in reproducing the @xmath19 900 nb peak and the shape of differential cross section data at other energies .",
    "the agreement for the polarization data is , as expected for the breit - wigner resonance model , poor but qualitatively correct .",
    "that should not come as a surprise because the breit - wigner resonance model is only a crude approximation of reality because the polarization , being an amplitude interference effect , is very dependent on the @xmath62/@xmath63 relative phase .",
    "the experimental data are tolerably reproduced at energies lower then 1700 mev , but the disagreement is strong for the forward angles , and especially at higher energies .    being dissatisfied with the predictions of the breit - wigner resonance model with pdg resonance parameters we have repeated the fit in order to obtain a good description of the absolute value of the total cross section maintaining the shape of the differential cross sections of the ( linear in cos@xmath2 as indicated by experimental data of ref .",

    "we conclude that only the reduction of the @xmath65 partial width from 180 mev to 68 mev , as obtained in @xmath70 , is not enough to consistently explain the size of the total cross section peak of @xmath15 900 nb together with the correct overall energy behavior .",

    "the change in differential cross section in figure [ fig:2 ] is in practice indistinguishable from values of @xmath70 .",

    "we remind the reader that no breit - wigner resonance solution ( see table 1 and figure [ fig:1 ] ) is able to follow the trend of experimental data ; the solution either reproduces the size of the 1710 mev peak and under - shoots the 1780 mev range ( _ sol  2 _ ) or the other way around ( _ sol 1 _ ) .    as we have mentioned in the introduction",

    "we emphasize that the existing data are of extremely poor quality , even inconsistent and controversial in the w @xmath15 1700 mev range , exactly where a signal from the 1700 mev resonant state should be visible .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid model dependent amalgamation procedure , we call for a fast re - measurement of the process having in mind the failure of standard models to reproduce the @xmath88 900 nb peak .",
    "such measurements are already proposed @xcite , but unfortunately not yet approved .",
    "in previous chapter we have demonstrated that within the scope of the breit - wigner resonance model the experimental data support the existence of the p@xmath0(1710 ) resonant structure .",
    "we do expect that such a conclusion will be confirmed within the framework of the more complex coupled - channel calculation revealing new quantitative information about partial wave resonant structure .    addressing the @xmath5 or @xmath6 nature of the expected @xmath65 resonant structure",
    "is a tough problem because we have to determine what is the signal that distinguishes whether the resonant state is of three or five quark nature . as we may write down the fock space expansion of any / each baryon as a linear combination of @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , we are left with a problem of distinguishing between a three quark state with the diquark contribution coming from the sea quarks , and the genuine pentaquark states . as for yet",
    ", we can not give a firm and unique definition of such a signal so we can only draw attention to some indications which of the configurations , three or five quark , is more probable for the established p@xmath0(1710 ) resonant structure .",
    "such an analysis is presently based only on the similarity of the mass , total width and branching ratio of the physically observed p@xmath0(1710 ) resonant structure to either of the quark model predictions .",
    "we suggest that the decisive factor is the size of the branching ratio to inelastic strange channels , to @xmath20 channel in our case .    as a start",

    "they are summarized in table 2 .",

    "first , model predicted total widths of the p@xmath0 resonance are bigger then 100 mev ( @xmath89 mev ) .",
    "second , the branching ratio of the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state to the @xmath20 channel is much lower then the branching ratio to the @xmath43 channel ( @xmath90 ) . that is the consequence of the fact that these models do not have any direct mechanism of strange particles production so they both have difficulty to make the branching ratios to the @xmath20 channel comparable to the experimental value ( @xmath91 ) @xcite .",
    "other quark models do not even give any predictions for the decay to strange channels .",
    "on the other hand , pentaquark models predict the total width of the non - strange pentaquark to be lower then 40  mev and the branching ratio to the @xmath20 channel to be comparable to the branching ratio to the @xmath43 channel ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "let us summarize : the pentaquark models predict the total width of the p@xmath0 state to be lower , and the branching ratio to the @xmath20 channel to be much higher then standard three quark models . and",
    "that is the only criterion we can offer to determine whether the physical n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state @xcite is of a @xmath5 or @xmath6 nature .",

    "they partly follow the trend of the three quark models for the width , but the trend of the pentaquark model for the branching ratio .",
    "the width of the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state is rather undetermined but bigger the 100 mev ( @xmath22  mev ) , while the branching fraction to the @xmath20 channel is not low , but quite comparable to the branching fraction to the @xmath43 channel .",
    "the afore discussed criteria are summarized in table [ table2a ] .",
    "the criteria are indecisive for @xmath68 and @xmath96 , and are qualitatively the same as for pdg results .",
    "for @xmath69 the branching ratio to @xmath20 channel gets bigger , but the partial width is so big that the resonant states should be of three quark origin .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath71 are definitely closer to what would one expect that the pentaquark state should look like .",
    "the branching fraction to the @xmath20 channel exceeds the branching fraction of the @xmath43 channel ( @xmath97 ) , and the width tends to go below 90 mev .",
    "we believe that the _ sol 3 _ is not acceptable because of problems of the total cross section in the 1750 mev range , and to our `` taste '' the @xmath71 looks very much like a mixture of a pentaquark ( low @xmath98 and high @xmath95 ) , and a standard three quark state ( high @xmath98 and low @xmath95 ) .",
    "however , we can not offer any proof that one of the two suggested states indeed is a pentaquark .",
    "accepting the arguments of ref . @xcite that it is impossible to produce the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 state as a pure pentaquark state , one of the solutions to the problem is that the physically observed p@xmath0 state is a mixture of two states : one of three - quark and second of pentaquark nature .",
    "however , the nature may complicate matters even more because the hybrid baryons of the type @xmath99 may easily contribute to the p@xmath0 wave as well , so this state can be a simultaneous admixture of both , pentaquarks and hybrid baryons to the @xmath100 state .",
    "the whole problem of hybrid @xmath99 barons is extensively discussed in literature .",
    "we refer the reader to the summary presentation of the topic given in ref .",
    "the breit - wigner resonance model calculation using the standard set of parameters for the n(1650 )  s@xmath0 , n(1710 )  p@xmath0 and n(1720 )  p@xmath1 resonances of ref .",
    "@xcite is not able to understand the @xmath101 900 nb peak .",
    "it reproduces the overall absolute value of the total cross section reasonably well , and manages to reproduce the shape of the angular distribution only at w=1683 mev .",
    "however , it fails miserably in reproducing the shape of the differential cross section at other energies .",
    "the new breit - wigner resonance model fit with only one p@xmath0 resonance has improved the shape of the differential cross sections at all energies , and indicates that the contribution of the n(1720 )  p@xmath1 resonance is negligible .",
    "the 900 nb total cross section peak is not yet understood .",
    "the faithful reproduction of the 900 nb total cross section peak of the amalgamated total cross section data can be achieved only if the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonance is fairly narrow ( @xmath102 68  mev ) , but then the agreement with the total cross section data at higher energies is spoiled .    the simultaneous reproduction of the @xmath19 900 nb peak and the higher energy total cross section values can within the breit - wigner resonance model be only achieved if the existence of another p@xmath0 resonance is assumed .    addressing the @xmath5 or @xmath6 nature of the resonant structure of total cross section in the energy range of 1700  mev we re - open the possibility that the additional p@xmath0 resonance present in 1700  mev energy range in addition to the standard n(1710 )  p@xmath0 pdg - resonance @xcite is a cryptoexotic pentaquark state .",
    "the second p@xmath0 state is the prediction of the zagreb group made in 1995 .",
    "@xcite , and already mentioned as a possible physical realization of the pentaquark model in the original diakonov et .",
    "publication @xcite .    in order to confirm that the n(1710 )  p@xmath0 resonant state is , or at least has the admixture of a non - strange pentaquark , the proper distinguishing criteria between @xmath5 or @xmath6 have to be developed .",
    "the present qualitative considerations are only indicative .    the precise measurement of the total cross section and angular distributions of the @xmath30n @xmath29 @xmath20 process in the energy range is urgently needed and strongly recommended , because no serious theoretical analysis can be performed on the basis of present data set .",
    "the decisive conclusion about the existence of the @xmath65 non - strange pentaquark will be possible only when the improved set of data is fully incorporated in one of the existing coupled - channel partial wave analyses @xcite using all , elastic and inelastic experimental data in the 1650 - 1850 mev energy range",
    ". only then the minimal necessary number of p@xmath0 resonances will be unambiguously determined .",
    "the elimination of a cusp effect as a source of the observed structure will be as well achieved in the framework of a coupled - channel , multi - resonance theoretical analysis . as the the @xmath76 channel is the most probable reason for the cusp effect it has to be included in such an analysis .",
    "the data for the @xmath30n @xmath29 k@xmath103 process in the energy range are scarce @xcite so the measurement of the total cross section and angular distributions for that process are badly needed as well . in this article , using the breit - wigner resonance model only , we show a strong indication that a standard , wide p@xmath0 resonance is incompatible with the existing data , and that a narrow p@xmath0 state weakly coupled to the @xmath104 channel is quite probable",
    ".      we are grateful to k. kadija from rudjer bokovi institute , a member of na49 collaboration , for a constant encouragement to link our `` p@xmath0 '' problems with the new pentaquark states .",
