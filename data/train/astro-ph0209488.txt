    "for small variations in @xmath1 , the relative wavelength separation between the transitions of an alkali doublet ( ad ) is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "savedoff @xcite first utilized this to constrain possible variations in @xmath1 from ad separations seen in galaxy emission spectra .",
    "the advantage of this technique is the large look - back times inherent in such cosmological observations ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "absorption lines produced by intervening clouds along the line of sight to qsos are substantially narrower than intrinsic emission lines and so yield tighter limits on @xmath1-variation @xcite .",
    "spectrographs on 810-m optical telescopes can record high resolution ( @xmath11 ) , high signal - to - noise ( @xmath12 ) spectra of high redshift qsos over most of the optical range ( i.e. 30008000 ) in several @xmath13 exposures .",

    "@xcite have recently used spectra of 16 siiv ads with a mean redshift @xmath14 to obtain a value for the fractional difference between @xmath1 in the laboratory and in the qso spectra , @xmath15 .",
    "the systematic error term arose from uncertainties in the laboratory wavelengths of the siiv transitions : the astronomical spectra were of comparable quality to uv laboratory spectra .",
    "significant improvements in the laboratory wavelengths @xcite reduce this systematic error to @xmath16 .",
    "we have analyzed 21 high quality siiv doublets observed with the hires spectrograph on the keck i 10-m telescope in hawaii , finding @xcite @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "the factor of 3 improvement in precision is due to the high spectral resolution of the hires data .",
    "this is currently the strongest constraint on @xmath19 from the ad method .",
    "the ad method is simple , but inefficient .",
    "the @xmath20 ground state is most sensitive to changes in @xmath1 ( i.e. it has the largest relativistic corrections ) but is common to both transitions ( fig .",
    "a more sensitive method is to compare transitions from different multiplets and/or atoms , allowing the ground states to constrain @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "this is the many multiplet ( mm ) introduced in @xcite .    to illustrate the mm method ,",
    "consider the following semi - empirical equation for the relativistic correction , @xmath21 , for a transition from the ground state with total angular momentum , @xmath22 : @xmath23\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is nuclear charge and many - body effects are described by @xmath25 . to obtain strong constraints on @xmath19 one can ( a ) compare transitions of light ( @xmath26 ) atoms / ions with those of heavy ( @xmath27 ) ones and/or ( b ) compare @xmath20@xmath28 and @xmath29@xmath28 transitions of heavy elements .",
    "for the latter , the relativistic corrections will be of opposite sign which further increases sensitivity to @xmath1-variation and strengthens the mm method against systematic errors in the qso spectra ( see section [ sec : syserr ] ) .",
    "more formally , we may write the following equation for the rest - frequency , @xmath30 , of _ any _ transition observed in the qso spectra at a redshift @xmath31 : @xmath32\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the frequency measured in the laboratory on earth ( we omit higher order terms here for simplicity ) .",
    "laboratory measurements @xcite of @xmath33 for many transitions commonly observed in qso spectra now allow a precision of @xmath34 to be achieved .",
    "the @xmath35 coefficient contains all the relativistic corrections and measures the sensitivity of each transition frequency to changes in @xmath1 .",
    "these have been calculated in @xcite to @xmath36 precision using the dirac - hartree - fock approximation and many - body perturbation theory .",
    "note that the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : omega ] ensures one can not infer a non - zero @xmath19 due to errors in the @xmath35 coefficients .",
    "3 shows the distribution of @xmath35 coefficients in ( rest ) wavelength space .",
    "our sample conveniently divides into low- and high-@xmath31 subsamples with very different properties .",
    "note the simple arrangement for the low-@xmath31 mg / feii systems : the mg transitions are used as anchors against which the large , positive shifts in the feii transitions can be measured .",
    "compare this with the complex arrangement for the high-@xmath31 systems : low - order distortions to the wavelength scale will have a varied and complex affect on @xmath19 depending on which transitions are fitted in a given absorption system . in general , the complexity at high-@xmath31 will yield more robust values of @xmath19 .",
    "for each absorption system we fit multiple velocity component voigt profiles to all available ( typically @xmath375 ) mm transitions .",
    "we minimize @xmath38 for all velocity components _ simultaneously _ to obtain the best fitting value of @xmath19 .",
    "the 1@xmath9 error is derived from the diagonal terms of the final parameter covariance matrix .",
    "monte carlo simulations demonstrate the reliability of both @xmath19 and the errors .    the mm method was first applied to 30 low-@xmath31 mg / fe systems and provided a tentative non - zero @xmath19 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we extended the sample of @xcite to 49 absorption systems , finding 4.1@xmath9 evidence for a smaller @xmath1 in the redshift range @xmath39 .",
    "we have now increased our sample to 128 absorption systems , all observed with keck / hires .",
    "our new preliminary weighted mean is @xmath40 for @xmath41 , i.e. 5.7@xmath9 statistical evidence for a smaller @xmath1 in high redshift absorption systems .",
    "we plot @xmath19 versus @xmath42 in fig .",
    "4 . note the overall internal consistency of the results .",
    "5 suggests possible evolution of @xmath1 with cosmological time , although see section [ sec : limits ] for further discussion and caveats of fixing @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "the statistical error in this result is now small : we do detect line shifts in the qso spectra . but are the line shifts due to systematic errors or really due to varying @xmath1 ?",
    "we have thoroughly searched for possible systematic errors in our previous results @xcite , finding none which provide an alternative interpretation of the data .",
    "we have extended this search to the new data in fig .",
    "4 with similar results .",
    "currently , our two largest sources of possible systematic error are :    1 .",
    "atmospheric dispersion effects : before 1996 keck / hires had no image rotator and so the effects of atmospheric dispersion on the wavelength scale could not be avoided .",
    "effective compression of the spectra may result , possibly mimicking a negative @xmath19 at low-@xmath31 .",
    "77 of our 128 absorption systems could have been affected .",
    "however , we find _ no evidence for these effects _ : the `` affected '' and `` unaffected '' subsamples yield the same @xmath19 . nevertheless , we modeled the potential effect and correct the 77 affected systems in fig . 6 ( top panel ) .",
    "this correction reduces the significance of the low-@xmath31 points but increases the significance of those at high-@xmath31 , enhancing the apparent trend in @xmath19 with @xmath31 .",
    "isotopic ratio evolution : we fit mg and si absorption lines with terrestrial values of the isotopic ratios .",
    "if the isotopic abundances in the absorption clouds are different to the terrestrial values then we may introduce artificial line shifts , potentially leading to @xmath45 .",
    "galactic observations @xcite and theoretical models @xcite strongly suggest that only the @xmath46 mg and @xmath47si isotopes will exist in the absorption clouds with significant abundances .",
    "the middle panel of fig . 6 shows that the low-@xmath31 points become _ more _ significant when we fit only these isotopes to our data .",
    "the above two effects can not explain our results .",
    "indeed , applying both corrections ( lower panel of fig .",
    "6 ) , yields a more significant result .",
    "comparing absorption lines of the hydrogen hyperfine ( 21-cm ) transition and millimetre - wave molecular rotational transitions offers an order of magnitude gain in precision over the mm method ( per absorption system ) .",
    "the 21-cm / mm frequency ratio is @xmath48 @xcite : @xmath49 manifests itself as a difference between the 21-cm and mm absorption redshifts .",
    "a similar difference may arise between 21-cm and optical absorption lines , in this case constraining @xmath5 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the proton @xmath7-factor and @xmath8 is the electron - proton mass ratio .",
    "however , systematic errors in these techniques are more difficult to quantify than for the optical mm method . since the radio and mm continuum emission come from separate regions of the background qso , the 21-cm and mm absorption may occur along slightly different sight - lines .",
    "thus , a statistical sample of such measurements is required .",
    "unfortunately , due to the paucity of known absorption systems , only two 21-cm / mm comparisons @xcite and one 21-cm / optical comparison @xcite presently exist ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "we summarize the strongest current constraints on @xmath1-variation in fig . 7 . for brevity , we do not discuss the reliability of the ` local ' constraints , and refer the reader to @xcite for a review .",
    "instead we focus on a comparison of the local and cosmological constraints . despite the tight limits on @xmath19 from laboratory atomic clocks , the oklo phenomenon and meteoritic @xmath50-decay",
    ", a simple non - linear evolution of @xmath1 with time can explain all results simultaneously .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that it is dangerous to compare local and cosmological limits without a better understanding of possible spatial variations in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for example , absorption spectroscopy of @xmath51 absorption clouds in our galaxy may not yield @xmath52 ( cf . fig 5 ) . even comparing the different qso absorption constraints",
    "is difficult since the mm and ad methods constrain @xmath1 whereas the 21-cm / mm and 21-cm / optical methods constrain @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "although the results in fig . 4 would have tremendous theoretical implications , confirming or refuting them is an observational issue .",
    "we are taking two main steps to check our recent results :    1 .   independent optical data .",
    "the greatest present concern is that only one instrument has been used for all our observations .",
    "qso spectra of similar quality to the keck / hires data are now becoming available .",
    "data from other telescopes / instruments ( e.g. vlt / uves ) will provide an important check on our results .",
    "2 .   further 21-cm / mm / optical comparisons .",
    "we are carrying out observations aimed at identifying new hi 21-cm and mm - band molecular rotational absorption systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) . obtaining a statistical sample of 21-cm / mm and 21-cm / optical comparison",
    "is vital for negating the line - of - sight velocity differences discussed above .",
    "if step ( 1 ) confirms our keck / hires results then step ( 2 ) will be a crucial check with entirely different systematic errors .",
    "we acknowledge the continued support of chris churchill , jason prochaska and arthur wolfe who provided the previous keck / hires datasets .",
    "we are indebted to wallace sargent for the new keck / hires dataset .",
    "we are grateful to the john templeton foundation for supporting this work .",
