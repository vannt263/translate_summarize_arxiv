    "<S> the magnetic properties of matter under extreme conditions are of particular importance to understanding the neutron star interior . </S>",
    "<S> one contributing factor to the magnetic field of a neutron star could be the ferromagnetic phase of nuclear matter . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present a self - consistent , relativistic description of ferromagnetism in dense matter , within which the ferromagnetic phase diagram for neutron matter is calculated .    </S>",
    "<S> ferromagnetism , relativistic mean - field , neutron matter    the properties of dense nuclear matter are of interest to various branches of topical research . </S>",
    "<S> one area of interest is the description of the constituent matter of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> neutron stars are extreme laboratories : extremes in pressure , density and magnetic field are just some of the factors that need to be considered when studying neutron star matter . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron star interior is believed , at least in part , to consist of nuclear ( baryonic ) matter . </S>",
    "<S> since charge neutrality of the star is required ( a nett charge would result in a coulomb force that will rip the star apart ) the majority of the baryonic matter should be neutrons @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the very strong magnetic field of neutron stars has been a topic of discussion for some time . </S>",
    "<S> brownell and callaway @xcite as well as silverstein @xcite proposed that the ferromagnetic phase of nuclear matter can make a significant contribution to the magnetic field of a neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> this idea was investigated by various authors , using both non - relativistic and relativistic models , most recently modarres and pourmirjafari @xcite , which also provides references to previous investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of these investigations seems to be inconclusive regarding the existence of a ferromagnetic phase of neutron matter and appear to be very model - dependent .    due to the extreme densities encountered in the neutron star interior </S>",
    "<S> relativistic effects become more pronounced and thus it has been argued @xcite that a relativistic description for the interior of the star may be necessary . thus , to investigate ferromagnetic effects in the baryonic part of the neutron star interior a relativistic description of ferromagnetism in neutron and nuclear matter needs to be considered . </S>",
    "<S> such a description of ferromagnetism was investigated by maruyama and tatsumi @xcite , which based their work on that of niembro et al ( see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to further this work by presenting a self - consistent calculation of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that a self - consistent approach is well - suited to this problem since the origin of the magnetic field in the ferromagnetic phase is the nucleon magnetic dipole moments , which in turn reacts to the presence of a magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform this self - consistent calculation in the relativistic mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by coupling the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron to the magnetic field of the ferromagnetic phase within the relativistic description pioneered by walecka @xcite called quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) . </S>",
    "<S> qhd is an effective field theory model for nuclear matter with mesons as degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it had undergone various extensions and modifications , as reviewed in @xcite and has been used extensively to study the properties of nuclei , nuclear matter and neutron stars ; see for instance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the coupling between the dipole moment and the magnetic field which was introduced by broderick et al @xcite to investigate the interaction between the magnetic dipole moment of nucleons and an external magnetic field . within the relativistic mean - field approximation we use the euler - lagrange equation to derive an equation of motion for the ferromagnetic magnetic field ( [ mft1bz ] ) , which we then solve self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> as far as we can establish such a self - consistent calculation using this coupling has not been performed previously .    to describe the interaction between the neutrons we couple the nucleon field @xmath0 to a scalar ( sigma ) @xmath1 and vector ( omega ) @xmath2 meson field and to the photon field tensor @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 meson describes the long - range attraction of the nn - potential , while the @xmath4 mesons accounts for the short - range repulsion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this description is valid for cold , neutral neutron matter , since the neutron matter is considered to be at zero temperature and the included mesons have no charge . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian is @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the free field component of the lagrangian for the neutrons , @xmath7 is the klein - gordon lagrangian for the scalar mesons and likewise @xmath8 is the proca lagrangian for the massive vector mesons . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the free - field component of the electromagnetic lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the mesons to the different nucleon densities is the standard coupling as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 are the generators of the lorentz group . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath11 there is no electric field and @xmath12 reduces to @xmath13 in a co - moving frame of reference , with @xmath14 the components of the magnetic field and @xmath15 the three spatial four - component spin matrices .    for the coupling strengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 the values of the qhd1 parameter set given in @xcite were used </S>",
    "<S> these coupling constants are chosen to fit various properties of nuclear matter at the nuclear saturation point ( @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the nucleon and electromagnetic coupling @xmath19 is left as a free parameter with the units of the nuclear magnetic dipole moment ( @xmath20 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is solved for in a co - moving frame of reference chosen , without loss of generality , so that the magnetic field lies in the @xmath21-direction .    in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) </S>",
    "<S> approximation the nucleon and meson operators are replaced by their groundstate expectation values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion of the various fields are then found to be @xmath22\\psi\\label{mft1nucleon}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the equation of motion of the @xmath4 meson field in ( [ mftomega ] ) , the rmf approximation results in the spatial components being zero and thus only the zeroth component is considered @xcite .    from ( [ mft1nucleon ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the equation of motion of the nucleons is a modified version of the dirac equation : @xmath23\\psi=\\big[-i{\\bm \\alpha}\\cdot\\nabla   + g_bb_z\\beta\\,\\sigma_z +           \\beta m^*\\big]\\psi,\\label{dirac }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 the effective mass and @xmath25 and @xmath26 the dirac matrices .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the nucleon ( dirac ) field @xmath0 can be constructed in analogy to the free particle solutions of the dirac equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath0 is assumed to have the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 the single particle energy . </S>",
    "<S> since a non - zero magnetic field would break the spherical symmetry of the ground state it is convenient to express @xmath29 in cylindrical coordinates as @xmath30 as pointed out by previous authors , @xcite and references therein , care has to be taken when considering the magnetic dipole moment ( spin ) of nucleons in the context of the dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the spin operator does not commute with the dirac hamiltonian , the matrix on the right hand side of ( [ dirac ] ) , and therefore spin is not a good quantum number . using the form of the wavefunction in ( [ kexpand ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the single particle energies are found to be @xmath31 here @xmath28 is labeled by @xmath32 , which refers to the contribution of the magnetic field to the single particle energies . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 will serve to differentiate between the two species of neutrons , but this should not be mistaken for a spin label . as in the case of the unmodified dirac equation both positive ( particle ) and negative ( antiparticle ) energies are found .    using the notation of ( [ kexpand ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the unnormalised dirac spinors for particle are @xmath34                                  [ m^*+\\lambda\\sqrt{k_\\bot^2+{m^*}^2 } ] }                                  { [ k_x+ik_y][e({\\bm k},\\lambda)+g_b b_z+\\lambda\\sqrt{k_\\bot^2+{m^*}^2}]}$\\\\                                  \\\\                                  </S>",

    "<S> the magnetic field therefore lifts the degeneracy between the states of the two neutron species . </S>",
    "<S> this splitting is illustrated in fig.@xmath38([fig : fermi ] ) for positive energy states , but also applies to the negative energy states . </S>",
    "<S> however the groundstate we consider only has positive energy nucleon states , which is filled to a certain energy , the fermi energy .        using ( [ kexpand ] ) to calculate the nucleon densities on the right hand side of equations ( [ mft1sigma ] - [ mft1bz ] ) , it can be shown that these equations are equivalent to the minimization of the energy density of the system , @xmath39 , @xmath40   + \\frac{1}{2}m_{\\sigma}^{2}\\phi^{2}+ \\frac{1}{2}m_\\omega^{2}\\omega_{0}^2           + \\frac{1}{2}e^2b_z^2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 the chemical potential and @xmath42 a step function to ensure that only energies below the fermi energy are considered .    </S>",
    "<S> we used the equations of motion to calculate the values of the different fields at a given density and value of the coupling @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant was increased at a fixed density until a non - zero value of the magnetic field was found . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig.@xmath38([fig : gb ] ) . in this figure </S>",
    "<S> the solid line represents the coupling strength @xmath19 at a specific density which would effect a ferromagnetic phase transition when no mesons are present . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line represents the case when mesons are included .    . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line represents the phase boundary when no mesons are included in the description and thus the neutrons only interact with the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line represents the phase boundary when mesons are also included . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath43 indicates the point where @xmath19 is at the value of the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron at a density which is equal to nuclear saturation density @xmath44 .,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we note that the vector mesons do not influence the phase transition since they couple to the nucleon density and merely shift the energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in the expression for the single particle energies ( [ singlepate ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the scalar meson is to reduce the mass of nucleon resulting in an effective mass @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction in the mass implies that for the same density the coupling constant @xmath19 has to be stronger than in the case when no mesons are present . </S>",
    "<S> fig.@xmath38([fig : gb ] ) clearly shows that the inclusion of the scalar mesons result in the phase transition occurring consistently at larger values of @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the curve in fig.@xmath38([fig : gb ] ) at low densities and with mesons included , results from the interplay between the contributions from the scalar and nucleon fields to the energy density .    from fig.@xmath38([fig : </S>",
    "<S> gb ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent that for the ferromagnetic phase to present itself in cold neutron matter the coupling between the nucleon field and the magnetic field has to have some density dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling at normal nuclear density ( the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron ) is just not strong enough to affect a phase transition even at very high densities . </S>",
    "<S> the density dependence of @xmath19 might be calculated by including renormalization effects , but this was not investigated in the current work .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the densities at which the ferromagnetic phase of neutron matter is stable can be reached in neutron stars . in the calculation </S>",
    "<S> done here such a stable phase generates a magnetic field of the order of @xmath45 gauss . </S>",
    "<S> this magnitude of the field in itself is not enough to explain the origin of the magnetic field of neutron stars , which are calculated to have surface magnetic fields of the order of @xmath46 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model presented here is a first approximation for neutron star matter , since only neutrons are included and only infinite matter considered . </S>",
    "<S> further work would entail studying the effects of including other hadrons and leptons in the model to obtain a more realistic description for neutron star matter . </S>",
    "<S> with such a model it might be possible to investigate the effects of a ferromagnetic phase on the equation of state of neutron star matter . </S>"
