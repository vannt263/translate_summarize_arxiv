    "experimental data obtained at hera @xcite clearly demonstrated rising behaviour of the structure function @xmath1 at small @xmath2 which is translated to the rising dependence of the total cross  section @xmath5 on center of mass energy @xmath6 .",
    "this effect is consistent with various dependencies on @xmath6 and has been treated in different ways , e. g. as a manifestation of hard bfkl pomeron @xcite , a confirmation of the dglap evolution in the perturbative qcd @xcite , a transient phenomena , i.e. preasymptotic effects @xcite or as a true asymptotical dependence of the off  mass  shell scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "this list is far from being complete and other interpretations can be found , e.g. in the review papers @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note here that the essential point in the study of low-@xmath2 dynamics is that the space - time structure of the scattering at small values of @xmath2 involves large distances @xmath7 on the light ",
    "cone @xcite and the region @xmath8 is sensitive to the nonperturbative contributions .",
    "inelastic scattering in this region turns out to be a coherent process where diffraction plays a major role and nonperturbative models such as regge or vector dominance model can be competitive with perturbative qcd successfully applied for description of the experimental data .    the strong experimentally observed rise of @xmath9 when @xmath10 with @xmath4 rising with @xmath11 from about @xmath12 to about @xmath13 was considered to a somewhat extent as a surprising fact on the grounds of our knowledge of the energy dependence of total cross  sections in hadronic interactions , where @xmath14 .",
    "the above comparison between photon  induced and hadron  induced interactions is quite legitimate since the photon is demonstrating its hadronlike nature for a long time .",
    "the apparent difference between the hadron and virtual photon total cross  section behaviours however has no fundamental meaning since there is no froissart  martin bound in the case off  shell particles",
    "@xcite . only under some additional assumptions this bound can be applied @xcite .",
    "this problem was addressed in @xcite on the basis of unitarity for off ",
    "shell scattering starting from the eikonal representation for the scattering amplitude .",
    "it was argued that the observed rise of @xmath9 can be considered as a true asymptotic behaviour and extension of the eikonal representation for off - shell particles does not provide limitations for @xmath9 at large @xmath6 .",
    "it was claimed that hera data can be described by the classical universal ( with @xmath11independent intercepts ) regge trajectories .    in the present paper",
    "we treat similar problems on the basis of the off  shell @xmath0matrix approach to the amplitude unitarization .",
    "it is shown that the unitary representation for off  shell particles and the respective extension of the chiral quark model for the @xmath0matrix can lead to eq .",
    "( [ wlq ] ) , where the exponent @xmath15 is related to the @xmath11dependent interaction radius of a virtual ( off  shell ) constituent quark .",
    "it is to be stressed here the importance of the effective interaction radius concept @xcite .",
    "the study of the effective interaction radius dependence on the scattering variables seemed very useful for understanding of the relevant dynamics of high energy hadronic reactions @xcite .",

    "the extension of the @xmath0matrix unitarization for the off - shell scattering was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was supposed that the virtual photon fluctuates into the virtual vector meson states which afterwards interact with a hadron .",
    "we considered a single effective vector meson field and used the notions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the amplitudes when both initial and final mesons are off mass shell , only initial meson is off mass shell and both mesons are on mass shell , correspondingly .",
    "the virtualities of initial and final vector mesons were chosen to be equal @xmath11 since we need the amplitude of the forward virtual compton scattering .    the equations for the amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 have the same structure as the equation for the on  shell amplitude @xmath21 but relate the different amplitudes .",
    "in the impact parameter representation ( @xmath22 ) they can be written as follows @xmath23 the solutions are @xmath24 ^ 2-u^{**}(s , b , q^2)u(s , b ) } { 1-iu(s , b)}.\\label{**}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also assumed the following relation @xmath25 ^ 2-u^{**}(s , b , q^2)u(s , b)=0.\\label{zr}\\ ] ] which can be identically fulfilled if the following factorization occurs : @xmath26 such factorization is valid , e. g. in the regge model with factorizable residues and the @xmath11independent trajectory .",

    "we consider the latter further in detail .",
    "thus , we have for the amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath19 @xmath27 and unitarity provides inequalities @xmath28 we consider off  shell extension of the model for hadron scattering @xcite , which is based on the ideas of chiral quark models",
    ". valence quarks located in the central part of a hadron are supposed to scatter in a quasi - independent way by the effective field . in accordance with the quasi - independence of valence quarks",
    "we represent the basic dynamical quantity in the form of product : @xmath29 in the impact parameter representation , @xmath30 is the total number of constituent quarks in the initial hadrons .",

    "fock approximation for the constituent quark scattering in the mean field .",
    "the picture of hadron structure implies that the overlapping of hadron structures and interaction of the condensates occur at the first stage of collision .",
    "due to excitation of the condensates , the quasiparticles , i.e. massive quarks arise .",
    "these quarks play role of scatterers . to estimate number of such quarks one could assume that part of hadron energy carried by the outer condensate clouds is being released in the overlap region to generate massive quarks .",
    "then their number can be estimated by the quantity : @xmath34 where @xmath35  constituent quark mass , @xmath36  hadron energy fraction carried by the constituent valence quarks .",

    "thus , @xmath41 quarks appear in addition to @xmath42 valence quarks .",
    "those quarks are transient ones : they are transformed back into the condensates of the final hadrons in elastic scattering .",
    "it should be noted that we use subscript @xmath32 to refer the constituent quark @xmath32 and the same letter @xmath32 is used to denote a virtuality @xmath11 .",

    "the @xmath38dependence of @xmath41 is weak compared to the @xmath38dependence of @xmath59 @xcite and therefore we have taken this function to be independent on the impact parameter @xmath38 .",
    "dependence on virtuality @xmath11 comes through dependence of the intensity of the virtual constituent quark interaction @xmath60 and the parameter @xmath61 , which determines the quark interaction radius ( in the on - shell limit @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .    following these considerations , the explicit dependencies of the generalized reaction matrices @xmath64 and @xmath65 on @xmath66 , @xmath38 and @xmath11",

    "similar result is valid also for the off mass shell particles when the interaction radius of virtual quark does not depend on @xmath11 and is equal to the interaction radius of the on  shell quark , i.e. @xmath77 . the behaviour of the total cross  section at large @xmath6 @xmath78 ^ 2    \\ln ^2 \\frac{w^2}{m_q^2},\\ ] ] corresponds to the result obtained in @xcite .    for the off  shell case ( and @xmath79 ) the situation is different and we have at large @xmath6 @xmath80 where @xmath81 we shall further concentrate on this as we currently think the most interesting case .",
    "however , it should be noted that for @xmath82 @xmath83 ^ 2,\\ ] ] i. e. asymptotically cross  section would be energy - independent and this option can not be excluded in principle , since we are dealing with the limit @xmath84 .",
    "the last scenario would mean that the experimentally observed rise of @xmath85 is transient preasymptotic phenomena @xcite .",
    "it can be realized when we replace in the formula for the interaction radius of the on  shell constituent quark @xmath86 the mass @xmath35 by @xmath87 in order to obtain the interaction radius of the off - shell constituent quark and write it down as @xmath88 , or equivalently replace @xmath61 for @xmath89 .",
    "all the above expressions for @xmath90 can be rewritten as the corresponding dependencies of @xmath1 at small @xmath2 according to the relation @xmath91 where @xmath92 . in particular , the eq .",
    "( [ totv ] ) will appear in the form @xmath93",
    "it is interesting that the value and @xmath11 dependence of the exponent @xmath4 is related to the interaction radius of the virtual constituent quark .",

    "it is clear that experiment leads to @xmath61 rising with @xmath11 .",
    "this rise is slow and consistent with @xmath100 extrapolation .",

    "( [ lamb ] ) , we predict saturation in the @xmath11dependence of @xmath4 , i.e. at large @xmath11 the flattening will take place .",
    "we considered limitations unitarity provides for the @xmath101total cross - sections and geometrical effects in the model dependence of @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the constituent quark s interaction radius dependence on @xmath11 can lead to a nontrivial , asymptotical result : the behaviour of @xmath85 will be @xmath3 , where @xmath4 will be saturated at large values of @xmath11 . this result is valid when the interaction radius of the virtual constituent quark is rising with virtuality @xmath11 .",
    "the reason for such rise might be of a dynamical nature and it could originate from the emission of the additional @xmath102pairs in the nonperturbative structure of a constituent quark . in the present approach constituent quark",
    "consists of a current quark and the cloud of quark  antiquark pairs of the different flavors @xcite .",

    "unitarity transforms this strong energy behaviour into the one , which depends on energy mildly @xmath106 when @xmath79 .",
    "it can even lead to the asymptotically constant cross ",
    "section @xmath85 when @xmath82 .",
    "the available experimental data for the structure functions at low values of @xmath2 continue to demonstrate the rising total cross - section of @xmath101interactions and therefore we currently consider rising with virtuality interaction radius of a constituent quark as a most relevant option , however , it does not mean that the other possibilities are principally excluded .",
