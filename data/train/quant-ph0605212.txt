    "the one - way model for quantum computation ( qc )  @xcite is an appealing alternative to the standard quantum circuit approach for physical systems where multipartite entangled resources , known as graph states  @xcite , can be generated with a minimal amount of dynamical processes . a certain class of these states , known as _ cluster states _ , have proven to be useful as universal resources upon which adaptive measurement based qc can be carried out .",
    "recently , considerable attention has been focused on cluster state based qc , in both theoretical  @xcite and experimental contexts  @xcite .",
    "the standard one - way model relies on the use of entangled two - dimensional systems ( qubits ) and adaptive single - qubit measurements to propagate information and simulate quantum gates .",

    "many physical setups exist that could be tailored to embody systems with the correct entanglement structure for qudit cluster states .",
    "these include ion - traps  @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamical ( cavity - qed ) settings  @xcite and linear optical setups  @xcite . compared to qubits , @xmath0-dimensional systems ( @xmath3 ) provide improvements in channel capacities for quantum communication  @xcite , better levels of security in quantum bit - commitment and coin - flipping protocols  @xcite and violations of local realism are much stronger for two maximally entangled qudits  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional systems ( qutrits ) are also known to optimize the hilbert space dimensionality for qc power @xcite .",
    "however , so far it is not clear if the use of @xmath0-dimensional information carriers provides any substantial advantage in one - way qc .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the use of @xmath0-dimensional systems in this context to see if advantages can be given by accessing a larger hilbert space .",
    "the accuracy of quantum information processing ( qip ) protocols using qubit cluster states is known to be affected significantly by sources of environmental decoherence and imperfections  @xcite and removing all but only the most essential qubits in the cluster state is key to effective simulations  @xcite .",
    "the central aim of this work is the study of the behavior of qip carried out when an environment affects single - mode @xmath0-dimensional systems that comprise the qudit cluster states .",
    "we find that disadvantages appear , in terms of robustness of qip protocols , when moving to higher dimensions ; the accuracy of simulations decreases as the dimension increases .",
    "in addition , entangled pairs of qubit linear clusters appear to be more resilient to environmental effects in comparison to qudit clusters .",
    "our study questions the worthiness of efforts made toward the extension of one - way qc to higher - dimensional systems , where global properties of the entangled resources are crucial for the performance of a given qip protocol .    in section",
    "ii we provide an overview of @xmath0-dimensional one - way qc . in section iii , we introduce the decoherence models used in our analysis and determine their overall effect on qudit cluster states using the state fidelity .",
    "entanglement decay is also studied using techniques for deducing concurrence in bipartite mixed states of arbitrary dimension  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not straighforward to compare properties such as the strength of entanglement or fidelity for states from different dimensions .",

    "in this section we consider linear qudit cluster states of length @xmath97 subject to the decoherence models of ad and pd introduced in the last section .",

    "a logical state is encoded on the first physical qudit and measurements are performed in order to propagate the state across the cluster : see fig .",
    "[ figu1a ] * ( a)*. this simple model gives an idea of how information flow is affected in general and the range of lengths of clusters considered allows us to see the effects on logical states rotated ( spread ) across the hilbert space .",

    "if the fidelity behaviors discussed above carry over to information transfer , we consider in fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] the average fidelities of arbitrary encoded logical qudits propagated along qudit cluster states of lengths @xmath97 when ad individually affects the physical qudits .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] * ( a ) * , * ( b ) * and * ( c ) * corresponding to dimensions @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , it becomes clear that there is a splitting effect seen only for dimensions @xmath2 , where clusters of even length suffer a more pronounced fidelity decay than those of odd length .",
    "in addition to this , for even lengths there is a noticeable drop in the fidelities as @xmath130 for increasing dimension . in fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] * ( d ) * we show these final even and odd fidelity values against increasing dimension . in fig .",
    "[ figu4 ] * ( c ) * , regardless of the splitting effects , we see that a @xmath131 linear cluster always outperforms a @xmath93 one .",
    "the reason for the splitting in odd and even lengths is the following .",
    "the state of a logical qudit propagated across a cluster of length @xmath132 in the limit @xmath130 becomes equal to that of the final physical qudit in the same limit ; _ i.e. _ it becomes @xmath133 .",
    "when the fidelity is taken and averaged over the configuration space , we obtain @xmath134 .    for odd length clusters ( even powers of @xmath135 )",
    "we have @xmath136 because @xmath137 and for even length clusters ( odd powers of @xmath135 ) we have @xmath138 .",
    "therefore for odd lengths , only the @xmath139 entry of the logical qudit state @xmath69 takes part in the overlap .",
    "when the average is performed over the configuration space only @xmath140 is averaged . in the even length case",
    "we have the integral @xmath141 . for qubits",
    "this gives @xmath142 , which matches the odd length integral .",
    "for pd , no splitting effects arise because as @xmath143 the final logical qudit state becomes @xmath144 , giving a fidelity of @xmath145 for all lengths @xmath146 . for @xmath147 , the final state of the qudit ( entangled pair ) as",
    "@xmath143 becomes @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) leading to higher final fidelity values than in the case of arbitrary @xmath61 , as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ figu3 ] * ( b ) * with fig .",
    "[ figu5 ] * ( a)*. in fig .",
    "[ figu5 ] * ( a ) * we show the average fidelity decay for arbitrary qudits propagated along linear clusters of length @xmath97 for dimensions @xmath150 and @xmath73 . here",
    "it is evident that as the dimension increases , the fidelity decays becomes faster for all length clusters . for clarity , we separate the @xmath151 case and",
    "compare it with the @xmath93 case in fig .",
    "[ figu5 ] * ( b)*. for each @xmath61 the @xmath151 cluster outperforms the @xmath93 qudit cluster .    to explain the robustness of the entangled qubit pair one needs to consider how the environment acts on each physical cluster qudit .",
    "due to the nature of the pd environment which scatters off each qudit system in the cluster , the terms @xmath152 of the density matrix decay faster for larger values of @xmath153 .",
    "one can see this from the time dependence of these terms by using eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) in the kraus operator evolution to obtain the relation @xmath154 .",
    "the behaviors shown above suggest that it is best to restrict logical qudit simulations to lower levels in smaller dimensional physical qudits that are entangled , rather than using the same dimension for the physical qudits in the cluster . in this way",
    "we exclude faster decay terms due to larger differences in the levels between low and high number states .",
    "thus , when pd is considered , @xmath155 will always outperform @xmath93 .    for ad the elements of @xmath38 decay in favor of @xmath156 ( @xmath157 as @xmath158 ) .",
    "in these dynamics , the slowly decaying elements for @xmath93 are @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "for @xmath131 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the slowly - decaying ones .",
    "the last two elements give an additional contribution to the fidelity with respect to the @xmath93 case . their presence",
    "is understood by inspecting @xmath38 in the qubit basis where we can see that the last two terms have the same total energy as the second and third terms and are identically affected by the ad environment , which can not distinguish between them . for higher dimensions ,",
    "similar considerations can be made for pd and ad .",
    "we conjecture that , based on the arguments described above , @xmath163 systems will have slower average fidelity decay than their @xmath0-dimensional equivalents .      from the analysis of information flow it seems that moving to higher dimensions greatly decreases the transfer quality , characterized by the state fidelity , when decoherence is present . as the one - way model is based on the ability of transferring information across linear subclusters comprising the entangled resource , this sets a serious hindrance on the use of higher - dimensional systems .",
    "however , the previous analysis did not exhaust the possibilities offered by the employment of @xmath0-dimensional elements .",
    "some advantages could come by encoding a logical qubit within the logical qudit being propagated .",
    "the average fidelity decays shown so far cover the entire hilbert space for a particular @xmath0 .",
    "qubits encoded in these spaces do not necessarily make use of the full space and some advantage could be obtained by ( in some sense ) _ hiding _ the information from the environment .    in order to introduce the encoding techniques , we look back at the hurwitz parameterization .",
    "a qubit state @xmath164 can be described simply as a state within the subspace of a @xmath91 dimensional hilbert space @xmath165 where @xmath166 . in general ,",
    "any @xmath167-dimensional state @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) can be described as a state within a particular subspace of a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xmath170 .",
    "we can thus take a state @xmath171 and use a unitary transformation @xmath172 to encode the state into the entire hilbert space . to apply an operation @xmath173 to a state encoded in a larger hilbert space , we use",
