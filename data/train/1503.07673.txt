    "observations of emission lines from be - like ions , such as c  iii , o  v , ca  xvii and fe  xxiii , provide useful diagnostics for density and temperature of astrophysical plasmas  see for example , @xcite . considering c  iii , early observations of strong emission",
    "( @xmath4 : 5696 @xmath5 ) and absorption ( @xmath4 : 4647 @xmath5 ) features in hd  192639 were reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite deduced electron densities using several line pairs arising from the @xmath6 = 2 transitions of c  iii in solar spectra obtained by the naval research laboratory s s082b instrument on board _",
    "skylab_. more recently , strong emission lines of c  iii ( @xmath7 4647 - 4650 - 4652 @xmath8 ) have been detected in spectroscopic survey of galactic o - type stars by @xcite .",
    "similarly , among ultraviolet emission lines in young low - mass galaxies at redshift z @xmath9 2 , @xcite noted that the strongest ( other than ly@xmath10 ) is always the blended c  iii @xmath41908 doublet .",
    "many observed lines of c  iii below 4700 @xmath5 are listed in the chianti database at http://www.chiantidatabase.org/. similarly , numerous transitions in the 2702070 @xmath5 wavelength range are included in the _ atomic line list _",
    "( v2.04 ) of peter van hoof at @xmath11 .    for the reliable interpretation of observations ,",
    "accurate atomic data are required for several parameters , such as energy levels , einstein coefficients or radiative rates ( a - values ) and excitation rates  see section 6 .",
    "energy levels for c  iii have been calculated by several workers ",
    "see for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "measurements of energy levels have been compiled and critically evaluated by the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) team @xcite and are available at their website http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm .",
    "similarly , a - values have been reported by numerous workers ",
    "see for example , @xcite .    since c  iii is an important ion in astrophysical ( and fusion ) plasmas , a few workers have reported data for collision strengths @xmath12 , or more importantly _ effective _ collision strengths @xmath13 , which are directly related to the excitation rates ( section 6 ) .",
    "early @xmath3-matrix calculations were mostly performed by berrington and his colleagues - see in particular @xcite and references therein .",
    "these included 12 states among @xmath0 3 configurations and were in @xmath14 coupling ( russell - saunders or spin - orbit coupling ) .",
    "subsequently , @xcite extended the calculations to 24 states ( including additional states of the @xmath6 = 4 configurations ) , and made other improvements , particularly in the generation of wavefunctions .",
    "however , their results for @xmath13 have been shown to be overestimated ( by up to 50% , particularly at lower temperatures ) for several important transitions , such as 2s@xmath15 @xmath16s@xmath17 ",
    "2s2p @xmath18p@xmath19 and 2s@xmath15 @xmath16s@xmath17 ",
    "2p@xmath15 @xmath16d@xmath20  see fig . 3 of @xcite .",
    "the calculations of @xcite are not only the most recent but also the most extensive , because they have reported data for transitions among 238 _ fine - structure _ levels , belonging to the @xmath0 7 configurations of c  iii .",
    "to determine energy levels and a - values , @xcite adopted the _ autostructure _ ( as ) code of @xcite .",
    "the wave functions generated were subsequently employed in the @xmath3-matrix code of @xcite for the calculations of @xmath12 , primarily obtained in @xmath14 coupling .",
    "corresponding results for desired fine - structure transitions were determined through their intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) method .",
    "furthermore , they resolved resonances in the thresholds region to finally determine values of @xmath13 . since c  iii is a comparatively light ion , higher - order relativistic effects ( neglected in the as and @xmath3-matrix codes ) are not very important , and hence their approach should give comparable results with a fully relativistic version , such as the dirac atomic @xmath3-matrix code ( darc ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case as recently demonstrated by us @xcite for five other be - like ions , namely al  x , cl  xiv , k  xvi , ti  xix and ge  xxix . for about 50% of the transitions ( of all ions )",
    "the @xmath13 of @xcite are overestimated , up to more than an order of magnitude , and over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "therefore , considering the importance of c  iii , we decided to perform yet another calculation so that atomic data can be confidently applied to the modelling of plasmas .",
    "as in all our earlier work on be - like ions , we have employed the fully relativistic grasp ( general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ) code , originally developed by @xcite , but significantly revised by one of its authors ( dr .",
    "p. h. norrington ) , and available at the website http://web.am.qub.ac.uk/darc/ , to determine the atomic structure , i.e. to calculate energy levels and a - values .",
    "similarly for the scattering calculations , we have adopted the unpublished darc code of p. h. norrington and i. p. grant , freely available at http://web.am.qub.ac.uk/darc/ ) .",
    "this is a relativistic version of the standard @xmath3-matrix code and is based on the @xmath21 coupling scheme .",
    "[ cols=\">,<,<,>,>,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     darc : present results with the darc code + icft : results of @xcite with the icft code +    our calculated values of @xmath13 are listed in table  8 over a wide temperature range up to 10@xmath22 k , suitable for applications to a wide range of astrophysical ( and laboratory ) plasmas .",
    "corresponding data at any intermediate temperature can be easily interpolated , because ( unlike @xmath12 ) @xmath13 is a slowly varying function of t@xmath23 .",
    "as already noted in section  1 , the most recent , extensive and perhaps best available corresponding data for @xmath13 are those by @xcite .",
    "similar to ourselves , they have adopted the ( semi - relativistic ) @xmath3-matrix code , resolved resonances in a fine energy mesh , averaged @xmath12 over a maxwellian distribution , and reported results for transitions among 238 levels , over a wide range of electron temperature up to 1.8@xmath110@xmath24 k. therefore , we undertake a comparison only with their results .    in table  9 we compare our results for @xmath13 with those of @xcite at three temperatures of 1800 , 90  000 and 450  000 k , for resonance transitions up to level 78 .",
    "the first and the third are the lowest and the highest _ common _ temperatures between the two calculations whereas the second is the most appropriate for applications to astrophysical plasmas , as already mentioned in section  5 .",
    "comparisons of @xmath13 for all transitions among the lowest 78 levels at these three temperatures are shown in fig .  3 ( a , b and c ) in the form of the ratio r = @xmath25/@xmath26 .",
    "note that negative values of r represent @xmath27/@xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "at the two higher values of t@xmath23 , the two sets of @xmath13 generally agree within 20% for most of the transitions listed in table  9 .",
    "however , differences are larger ( up to a factor of two ) for a few , particularly those with upper levels @xmath30 60 .",
    "unfortunately , the discrepancies are larger ( up to a factor of two ) at the lowest temperature of 1800 k , for about half the transitions , and in a majority of cases @xmath31",
    ". such discrepancies at low temperatures are not uncommon and mostly arise due to the position of resonances , because 1800 k is equivalent to only @xmath90.011 ryd , whereas our adopted energy mesh is 0.001 ryd . to reliably calculate @xmath13 at such low temperature(s ) , the energy mesh needs to be _ finer _ because our tests show that the uncertainty introduced by our ( comparatively ) coarse mesh is @xmath920% at t@xmath23 = 1800 k.    @xcite adopted a comparatively finer energy mesh of 0.000  04 ryd , but only for @xmath32 11.5 for which they performed the _ electron - exchange _ calculations . for higher partial waves , up to @xmath33 = 45",
    ", they adopted a coarser mesh of 0.004 ryd in a _ no - exchange _ calculation .",
    "these two different meshes should not normally matter for calculations of @xmath13 at low temperatures , such as 1800 k , because @xmath32 11.5 should be sufficient for the convergence of @xmath12 at low energies .",
    "therefore , their reported @xmath13 _ may be _ comparatively more accurate at this t@xmath23 . for transitions among all levels , in most cases the @xmath13 of @xcite are larger as shown in fig .",
    "3a , but in a few instances @xmath34 .",
    "examples where our data are larger include transitions 3856 , 3956 and 4056 , which are _ forbidden _ and have resonances close to the thresholds .",
    "as the calculations of @xcite are primarily in @xmath14 coupling , there is a possibility of these resonances being missed .",
    "nevertheless , this low temperature of 1800 k is not generally expected to be important for applications in plasma modelling and therefore we focus our attention on comparison at the two higher temperatures .    as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( b and c ) the discrepancies between our calculations and those of @xcite increase with increasing temperature . for about one fifth of the transitions ,",
    "the differences are larger than 20% , and in a majority of cases @xmath31 , by up to a factor of 20 .",
    "these discrepancies between the two independent calculations are consistent with those already found for other be - like ions , namely al  x , cl  xiv , k  xvi , ti  xix and ge  xxix @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the main source of inaccuracy in the calculations of @xcite for @xmath13 is the use of a limited energy range for calculating @xmath12 , up to only 11 ryd which is insufficient for the determination of @xmath13 up to 1.8@xmath110@xmath24 k ( or equivalently to 114 ryd ) , because the integral in eq .",
    "( 3 ) will not converge , although they have extended the energy range of @xmath12 following the suggested formulae of @xcite .",
    "however , in our work there is no requirement for such an extension because calculations for @xmath12 have already been performed up to sufficiently high energies , as detailed in section  5 .",
    "therefore , based on the comparisons discussed here as well as for other be - like ions and shown in fig .  3 , the results of @xmath13 by @xcite appear to be overestimated for at least 20% of the transitions among the lowest 78 levels of c  iii .",
    "energies for the lowest 166 levels of c  iii belonging to the @xmath0 5 configurations have been calculated with the grasp code . for the lowest 10 levels ,",
    "discrepancies with measurements are up to 8% , but agreement is better than 1% for the remaining 156 .",
    "radiative rates are also listed for four types of transitions ( e1 , e2 , m1 and m2 ) and no large discrepancies are noted for a majority of strong e1 transitions .",
    "these rates have been further employed to calculate lifetimes which are found to be in good agreement , for most levels , with other theoretical work as well as experimental values . based on several comparisons ,",
    "including the velocity and length ratios , our results for radiative rates , oscillator strengths , line strengths and lifetimes are judged to be accurate to better than 20% for a majority of strong transitions .",
    "collision strengths are reported for resonance transitions , at energies above thresholds , to facilitate future comparisons as at present no similar data exist .",
    "however , results for the more useful parameter @xmath13 are listed for _ all _ transitions among the 166 levels of c  iii and over a wide range of temperature up to 10@xmath22 k. this range of t@xmath23 should be sufficient for the modelling of a variety of plasmas , such as astrophysical and fusion .",
    "comparisons of @xmath13 have been made with the most recent results of @xcite , which are of comparable complexity and are available for a wider range of transitions and temperatures .",
    "for over one fifth of transitions , among the lowest 78 levels , the @xmath13 of @xcite differ with our results by more than 20% and by up to a factor of 20 . in most instances",
    "the @xmath13 of @xcite are larger , consistent with the pattern found for other be - like ions with 13 @xmath35 z @xmath35 32 @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of our @xmath12 and @xmath13 data is assessed to be better than 20% , for a majority of transitions , forbidden as well as allowed .",
    "this assessment is made partly based on comparisons with available results and our experience with other be - like ions , and mainly because : ( i ) we have included a large range of partial waves to achieve convergence of @xmath12 at all energies , ( ii ) have included the contribution of higher neglected partial waves through a top - up , ( iii ) have resolved resonances in a fine energy mesh to account for their contribution , and more importantly ( iv ) have calculated @xmath12 over a wide range of energy which allowed us to determine @xmath13 up to the highest temperature of our calculation , without any extrapolation .",
    "hence , we see no apparent limitations in our data and hope these can be confidently applied to the modelling of plasmas .",
    "nevertheless , scope remains for improvement , as for any calculation .",
    "this can perhaps be achieved by the inclusion of levels of the configurations with @xmath36 5 in the generation of wave functions and the scattering process .",
