    "in the framework of qcd , the spin of the nucleon is composed of the contributions from the quark spin , @xmath5 , and the gluon spin , @xmath6 , as well as the orbital angular momenta of quarks , @xmath7 , and gluons , @xmath8 : @xmath9 .",
    "the discovery , that the quark contribution @xmath5 is small @xcite , led to a series of measurements to determine the other spin contributions . since qcd fits only give weak constraints on @xmath6 , it has to be measured directly .",
    "first investigations were performed by the hermes @xcite and the smc@xcite collaborations using high @xmath10 hadron pairs in the final state .",
    "the primary goal of the compass experiment is to perform a precise measurement of @xmath11 also with a new approach .",
    "therefore charmed meson production is studied , since the selection of charmed mesons in the final state provides an event sample of photon - gluon fusion ( pgf ) events with no background from other physical processes .",
    "the pgf process is the main reaction for the production of charm quarks in dis . due to the high charm mass , the charm content of the nucleon",
    "can be neglected as well as the production of charm quarks during fragmentation . in the independent fragmentation of a @xmath13 pair most",
    "frequently @xmath12  mesons are produced .",
    "on average 1.2 @xmath3  mesons are produced per each @xmath13 pair @xcite . +",
    "the @xmath3  mesons are reconstructed from their @xmath14 decay which has a branching ratio of @xmath15 .",
    "the reconstruction is done using tracks reconstructed in the compass spectrometer .",
    "a detailed description of the spectrometer can be found in @xcite .",
    "the thick nucleon target of the compass experiment does not allow a separation of production and decay vertex of the charmed meson .",
    "thus , the reconstruction of @xmath12 mesons is done on a combinatorial basis . for each",
    "oppositely charged track pair in a given event the invariant mass is calculated using    l0.5    ( 6,5.6 ) ( 0.2,-0.5 )    the kaon mass hypothesis for one of the tracks . + to suppress the high combinatorial background several cuts are applied on the track pair .",
    "the most important requirement is the particle identification for the kaon candidate from the ring imaging cherenkov detector .",
    "the rich allows to separate @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a momentum range from the particle s cherenkov threshold to about @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rich ] shows the rich response for these three particle types as a function of their momenta . as can be seen , kaons can be identified starting from the kaon threshold around @xmath20 .",
    "+ due to the large charm mass the fraction of energy from the virtual photon that is carried by the meson , @xmath21 , is expected to be higher for a real charmed meson than for combinatorial background .",
    "therefore a cut of @xmath22 is applied on the @xmath3  candidates . a third cut to reduce the combinatorial background is applied on the angle between the @xmath3  flight direction and the @xmath17 momentum vector in the @xmath3  rest frame , @xmath23 . + with these cuts the ratio of open charm events to combinatorial background is still in the order of @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : dssig ] ) .",
    "therefore , a second more exclusive channel is also studied : @xmath25 . due to the small mass difference between @xmath2  and @xmath3 , combinatorial background",
    "can be very much suppressed by a cut on the mass difference : @xmath26 .",
    "here , @xmath27 denotes the mass of the @xmath2  candidate and @xmath28 the mass of the @xmath3  candidate . since this so - called @xmath2tag is very effective in the reduction of combinatorial background , the @xmath21 and the @xmath29 cuts can be relaxed . with @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath2",
    "tagged @xmath3  mesons a signal to background ratio of 1:1 can be obtained ( cf .",
    "[ fig : dssig ] ) .",
    "the @xmath6 measurement at compass is based on the photon gluon fusion ( pgf ) process . in this process",
    "the photon emitted by the incoming muon interacts with a gluon embedded in the nucleon .",
    "the interaction occurs via the exchange of a virtual quark resulting in a @xmath32 pair in the final state .",
    "studying the scattering of a polarised muon beam off a polarised target gives access to experimental muon - nucleon asymmetries of the tagged pgf process . to access the gluon polarisation @xmath6 information about the hard subprocess",
    "is needed , which is combined in the analysing power @xmath33 .",
    "it contains the information about the partonic asymmetries from the muon - gluon scattering process . to determine @xmath33",
    "the kinematic variables of the hard subprocess are needed .",
    "+ since only one of the two mesons is reconstructed , the full kinematics of the pgf process is not known for each single event .",
    "thus , a parametrisation based on measured quantities was introduced , providing an estimation of @xmath33 for each open charm event .",
    "the parametrisation was obtained by training a neural network with an event sample generated with the    l0.5    ( 10,6.5 ) ( -0.7,-0.3 ) ( 1.8,3.1 ) ( -0.7,3.1 ) ( 1.8,6.5 )    aroma generator in leading order qcd . for these events",
    "the full pgf kinematics were available as well as the reconstructed observables from the @xmath3  mesons .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath33 values coming directly from the generated quantities and the reconstructed @xmath33 from the parametrisation is about @xmath34 .",
    "this procedure allows an evaluation of the analysing power for every event entering the @xmath4 determination .",
    "the data analysis leading to @xmath4 is based on event rates for scattering from a polarised muon beam off a polarised target . since",
    "a separation between the remaining background events and the signal events in the final event sample is not possible , the signal purity of the event sample , @xmath35 , has to be introduced .",
    "it is determined from a fit to the final mass spectra . to optimise the description of the signal purity ,",
    "this fit is done separately for events from the two target cells and for different bins of @xmath33 .",
    "+ the observed event counting rates @xmath36 in the two oppositely polarised target cells of the compass target are related to @xmath4 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) denotes the beam ( target ) polarisation and @xmath40 the number of nuclei in the target .",
    "the dilution factor @xmath41 describes the fraction of polarisable material in the target . for @xmath42",
    "this dilution factor is about @xmath43 .",
    "the beam particle is required to cross both target cells providing a cancellation of the beam flux @xmath44 . to cancel out the acceptance difference for the two cells ,",
    "the target spin orientation is reversed every eight hours , leading to a total of 4 counting rates . from their double ratio @xmath45 @xmath4 can be determined assuming a negligible background asymmetry @xmath46 and a stable detector performance leading to a cancellation of the acceptance factors , @xmath47 this method is applied to the events from every data taking period as well as for the two channels separately . to improve the statistical significance of the result ,",
    "event weighting is used .",
    "the final result is then calculated as the weighted mean of the results for each channel and data taking period .",
    "r0.55    ( 8,3.45 ) ( -0.0,-0.4 )    with the 2002 - 2004 data the preliminary result for the compass open charm analysis of @xmath48 was obtained . for the measured sample",
    "the average @xmath49 is @xmath50 with rms 0.08 and the hard scale at which this result was obtained is @xmath51 .",
    "+ the largest contributions to the systematic uncertainty of this result are possible false asymmetries ( 0.10 ) , the choice of the fit function for the signal purity ( 0.09 ) and possible background asymmetries ( 0.07 ) .",
    "there was no observation of any background asymmetry or false asymmetry from detector instabilities , so the actual values of these contributions are dominated by the statistical precision of the study .",
    "the influence of the choice for the fit function to describe the signal purity was estimated using different fit functions in the determination of @xmath4 .",
    "+ further contributions to the systematic uncertainty are coming from the choice of monte carlo parameters ( 0.05 ) , the number of bins for the signal - purity fit ( 0.04 ) and the uncertainties of the dilution factor ( 0.03 ) and the polarisation measurements ( both 0.03 ) .",
    "the result for the first @xmath11 measurement from the open charm channel is presented .",
    "this is the most direct measurement of @xmath11 since it is only weakly dependent on monte carlo simulation .",
    "a comparison of the compass results and other existing results is given in figure  [ fig : dgg ] .",
    "the measurements are compared with the parton parametrisations from @xcite .",
    "the data points give an indication that curves corresponding to small values of @xmath6 are favored .",
