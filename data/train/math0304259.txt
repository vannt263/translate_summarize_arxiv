    "already difficulties arise : although the vacuum einstein equations @xmath0 for the lorentz metric @xmath1 suggest ( by analogy with the wave equation , for example ) that a mass ( energy ) which includes contributions from the gravitational field , should be built from the first derivatives of the field @xmath1 , it is clear that this is incompatible with coordinate invariance .    the schwarzschild vacuum spacetime metric , for @xmath2",
    ", @xmath3 provides an important clue , since the parameter @xmath4 governs the behaviour of timelike geodesics and may be regarded as the total mass . note that @xmath5 ensures the boundary @xmath6 is smooth and totally geodesic in the hypersurfaces @xmath7 .",

    "the discussion here is restricted to @xmath19 riemannian 3-dimensional geometry .",
    "this corresponds to the case of time - symmetric initial data : @xmath8 is a totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface in a lorentzian manifold , and we can identify the local matter ( equivalently , energy ) density with the scalar curvature @xmath20 .",
    "this simplification entails a small loss of generality : most , but not all , of the results we describe have been extended to general asymptotically flat space - time initial data @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the second fundamental form of a spacelike hypersurface @xmath11 .",
    "some results also generalize to the closely related bondi mass , which measures mass and gravitational radiation flux near null infinity , and to mass on asymptotically hyperbolic and anti - desitter spaces cf .",
    "@xcite , but these involve additional complications which we will not discuss here .    the positive mass theorem ( pmt ) in its simplest form",
    "is    suppose @xmath8 is a complete asymptotically flat 3-manifold with non - negative scalar curvature @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath23 , and @xmath24 iff @xmath25 .",
    "the rigidity conclusion in the case @xmath24 shows that @xmath26 for @xmath8 scalar flat ( `` matter - free '' ) but non - flat , so @xmath17 does provide a measure of the gravitational field .",
    "three distinct approaches have been successfully used to prove the pmt : with stable minimal surfaces @xcite ; with spinors @xcite and the schrdinger - lichnerowicz identity @xcite ; and using the geroch foliation condition @xcite .",
    "a number of other appproaches have produced partial results : using spacetime geodesics @xcite ; a nonlinear elliptic system for a distinguished orthonormal frame @xcite ; and alternative foliation conditions @xcite .",
    "the connection between these approachs remains mysterious ; the only discernable common thread is mean curvature , and this is quite tenuous .",
    "the application of the positive mass theorem to resolve the yamabe conjecture @xcite is well known .",

    "gluing two copies of @xmath8 along the totally geodesic boundary @xmath40 and conformally changing to @xmath41 where @xmath42 on the two copies of @xmath11 , gives a complete af manifold with @xmath43 and vanishing mass .",
    "the pmt shows @xmath44 is flat and it follows without difficulty that @xmath8 is schwarzschild .",
    "this extends previous results @xcite which required the boundary to be connected .",
    "-5 mm    a boundary component @xmath40 with mean curvature @xmath45 is called a _ black hole _ or _ horizon _ , since if @xmath8 is a totally geodesic hypersurface then @xmath40 is a trapped surface and hence , by the penrose singularity theorem @xcite , lies within an event horizon and is destined to encounter geodesic incompleteness in the predictable future .    the spatial schwarzschild metric @xmath46 with @xmath47 shows that the completeness condition in the pmt is important , but it can be weakened to allow horizon boundary components of @xmath11 .",
    "this follows immediately from the minimal surface argument @xcite ; or by an extension to the witten argument @xcite , imposing one of the boundary conditions @xmath48 on the spinor field @xmath49 , where @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 .",
    "an interesting extension is obtained by imposing the spectral boundary condition @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the projection onto the subspace of positive eigenspinors of the induced dirac operator @xmath54 . using the remarkable hijazi - br estimate @xcite @xmath55 for the eigenvalues of @xmath54 when @xmath56 , herzlich showed @xcite    if @xmath8 is asymptotically flat with @xmath20 and boundary @xmath56 with mean curvature satisfying @xmath57 where @xmath58 , then @xmath59 , with equality iff @xmath60 .",

    "it follows from ( [ hijazi ] ) and ( [ p+psi ] ) that @xmath67 and the result follows .",
    "observe that in each case , equality leads to flat @xmath68 .",
    "an elegant physical argument lead penrose to conjecture an analogous inequality , but which distinguishes the schwarzschild metric instead @xcite , see also @xcite .    if @xmath8 satisfies the conditions of the pmt , except that @xmath69 is compact with vanishing mean curvature and such that @xmath40 is the `` outermost '' closed minimal surface in @xmath11 , then @xmath70 with equality only for the schwarzschild metric .",
    "a closed minimal surface is said to be an _",
    "outermost horizon _ or _ outer - minimizing horizon _ if @xmath11 contains no least area surfaces homologous to @xmath40 in the asymptotic region exterior to @xmath40 .",
    "the outermost condition is essential , since examples of non - negative scalar curvature manifolds can be constructed by forming the connected sum of @xmath11 and large spheres by arbitrarily small and large necks .    the penrose conjecture has been established by huisken and ilmanen @xcite using a variational level set formulation of the inverse mean curvature flow @xcite , and by bray @xcite by a very interesting conformal deformation argument .",
    "bray s proof is more general since it takes into account contributions from all the connected components of the boundary .",
    "-5 mm    thus it is natural to consider @xmath71 as the mass of a black hole ( minimal surface ) @xmath40 .",
    "more generally , the correspondence with newtonian gravity suggests that any bounded region @xmath72 should have a _ quasi - local _ mass , which measures both the matter density ( represented in this case by the scalar curvature @xmath20 ) , and some contribution from the gravitational field .",
    "the rather satisfactory positivity properties of the total mass , as established by the pmt , motivate the properties we might expect such a geometric mass to possess @xcite .    1 .   * ( non - negativity ) *   @xmath73 ; 2 .   * ( rigidity / strict positivity ) *   @xmath74 if and only if @xmath72 is flat ; 3 .   *",

    "( adm limit ) *   @xmath77 should be asymptotic to the adm mass ; 6 .   *",
    "( black hole limit ) *   @xmath77 should agree with the black hole mass ( [ penrose ] ) .",
    "many candidates have been proposed for quasi - local mass ( see for example @xcite for a comparison of some definitions ) , the most significant being that of hawking @xcite , @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this equals @xmath80 for standard spheres in schwarschild .",
    "although @xmath81 for surfaces in @xmath68 , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath82 for a stable constant mean curvature 2-sphere @xmath40 in a 3-manifold of non - negative scalar curvature . thus for such `` round '' spheres , @xmath83 is nonegative , and the black hole limit condition is trivially satisfied .",
    "however the remaining properties , in particular rigidity and monotonicity , are rather problematic .",
    "although the twistorially - defined penrose quasi - local mass @xcite is well - behaved in special cases @xcite , it is defined unambiguously only for surfaces arising from embedding into a conformally flat spacetime , and even then numerical experiments @xcite strongly suggest that monotonicity is violated .    in fact , of the various proposals for @xmath77 , only the definitions of @xcite are known to satisfy positivity .",
    "dougan and mason @xcite show that the integral @xmath84 of the nester - witten 2-form ( [ nwform ] ) is positive for spinor fields @xmath49 on @xmath40 which satisfy a certain elliptic system on @xmath40 .",
    "however , bergqvist @xcite shows that positivity holds under much weaker conditions on @xmath49 , and there are many variant definitions with similar properties",
    ". it would be useful to understand these dm - style definitions better , and in particular whether any satisfy monotonicity .",
    "monotonicity and adm - compatibility imply @xmath85 for any region @xmath86 embedded isometrically in an @xmath8 satisfying ( as always ) the pmt conditions .",
    "this motivates the following definition @xcite    [ qlmass ] let @xmath87 denote the set of all asymptotically flat 3-manifolds @xmath8 of non - negative scalar curvature , with boundary which if non - empty , consists of compact outermost horizons , and such that @xmath8 has no other horizons . for any bounded open connected region @xmath72 , let @xmath88 be the set of @xmath89 such that @xmath86 embeds isometrically into @xmath11 , and define @xmath90 we say that @xmath11 satisfying these conditions is an _ admissible extension _ of @xmath86 .",
    "the horizon condition serves to exclude examples which hide @xmath86 inside an arbitrarily small neck , which would force the infimum to zero .",
    "this is a refinement @xcite of the original definition @xcite , which prohibited horizons altogether .",
    "clearly @xmath91 is well - defined and finite , once the region @xmath86 admits just one admissible extension .",
    "the pmt with horizon boundary implies non - negativity , and monotonicity follows directly .",
    "strict positivity of @xmath77 was established in @xcite , with the slightly weaker rigidity conclusion that if @xmath74 then @xmath86 is locally flat .",
    "agreement with the spherical mass , and the adm limit condition , follows also from @xcite .",
    "bray s results imply that @xmath91 agrees with the black hole mass in the limit as @xmath86 shrinks down to a black hole .",
    "in addition , @xmath92 for any admissible extension @xmath11 , so @xmath77 is the optimal quasi - local mass definition with respect to this condition .",
    "the optimal form of the horizon condition remains conjectural .",
    "bray has suggested an alternative condition , that @xmath86 be a `` strictly minimizing hull '' @xcite in @xmath11 , so @xmath93 has the least area amongst all enclosing surfaces in the exterior . in this case",
    "we say @xmath40 is _ outer minimizing _ , and denote by @xmath94 the quasilocal mass function defined by restricting admissible extensions to those @xmath11 in which @xmath40 is outer minimizing . for this modified definition",
    "the penrose inequality @xcite applies to show that if @xmath95 embeds into the schwarzschild 3-manifold with the same induced metric and mean curvature ( cf .",
    "( [ 2ndvar ] ) , ( [ staticbndry ] ) ) and encloses the horizon , then @xmath96 .",
    "it is not clear how to establish this natural result for the unmodified definition @xmath91 .",
    "-5 mm    although in many respects the definition of @xmath77 is quite satisfactory , it is not constructive , and thus it is important to determine computational methods .",
    "the key is the following @xcite    [ staticconjecture ] the infimum in @xmath77 is realised by a 3-metric agreeing with @xmath86 in the interior , _ static _ ( [ static ] ) in the exterior region , and such that the metric is lipschitz - continuous across the matching surface @xmath40 , and the mean curvatures of the two sides agree along @xmath40 .    a similar conjecture for the space - time generalisation of the quasi - local mass , asserts that the exterior metric is _ stationary _ , ie .",
    "admits a timelike killing field @xcite .    as motivation for this conjecture ,",
    "note first that if @xmath97 in some region , then a conformal factor @xmath98 can be found such that @xmath99 has less mass and @xmath100 .",
    "thus a mass - minimizing metric for ( [ qlmass ] ) , if such a metric exists , must have vanishing scalar curvature . now",
    "if the linearization @xmath101 is surjective then @xmath28 admits a variation which produces positive scalar curvature . the formal obstruction to surjectivity is non - trivial @xmath102 , which leads to the static metric equations ( [ static ] ) .",
    "corvino @xcite shows that if @xmath102 is trivial in @xmath103 then there are compactly supported metric variations in @xmath104 which increase the scalar curvature .",
    "this gives    if @xmath8 realizes the infimum in definition [ qlmass ] , then there is a @xmath105 such that @xmath31 satisfy the static metric equations ( [ static ] ) in @xmath106 .",
    "this suggests a computational algorithm for determining @xmath91 : find an asymptotically flat static metric with boundary geometry matching that of @xmath95 . to determine the appropriate boundary conditions , recall the second variation formula for the area of the leaves of a foliation labelled by @xmath107 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 are respectively the second fundamental form , mean curvature and gauss curvature of the leaves , @xmath110 is the lapse function , @xmath111 is the normal vector and @xmath112 is the laplacian on the leaves .",
    "our conventions give @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the volume element of the leaves .",

    "if true , this would give a prime candidate for the minimal mass extension .",
    "it is known ( pengzi miao , private communication ) that the boundary conditions ( [ staticbndry ] ) are elliptic for ( [ static ] ) .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that mass - minimizing sequences for @xmath77 should converge to a static metric .",

    "* theorem 5.2 ) shows that a sequence of metrics @xmath119 , close in the weighted sobolev space @xmath120 , @xmath121 , to the flat metric @xmath122 on @xmath68 and such that @xmath123 , converges strongly to @xmath122 in @xmath124 .",
    "similar results , under rather different size conditions , are given in @xcite , and a discussion of the general `` weak compactness '' conjecture may be found in @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    to estimate @xmath77 from above , it suffices to construct admissible extensions  metrics with non - negative scalar curvature and satisfying ( [ staticbndry ] ) .",
    "these boundary conditions exclude the usual conformal method .",
    "instead , metrics in _ quasi - spherical _",
    "form @xcite @xmath125 satisfy a parabolic equation for @xmath126 on @xmath127 evolving in the radial direction , when @xmath128 , with @xmath129 freely specifiable . since the metric 2-spheres @xmath130 have mean curvature @xmath131 , ( [ qsmetric ] ) provides admissible extensions for @xmath132 with mean curvature @xmath133 .",
    "the underlying parabolic equation derives from ( [ 2ndvar ] ) , and has been generalized to non - spherical foliations in @xcite . as an application ,",
    "choosing @xmath134 we can show        finding lower bounds for @xmath91 is more difficult .",
    "bray s definition of _ inner mass _ ( * ? ? ? * p243 ) gives a lower bound , but for @xmath94 .",
    "the difficulty here as above lies in showing that a horizon inside @xmath86 remains outermost when the inner region is glued to a general exterior region @xmath138 .",
    "this follows easily when @xmath139 is outer - minimizing in @xmath140 , as guaranteed by the definition for @xmath94 .    on physical grounds",
    "one expects that if `` too much '' matter is compressed into region which is `` too small '' , then a black hole must be present .",
    "the geometric challenge lies in making this heuristic statement precise , and the only result in this direction has been @xcite , which gives quantitative measures which guarantee the existence of a black hole .",
    "an observation by walter simon ( private communication ) is thus very interesting : if @xmath141 ( say ) and @xmath86 embeds isometrically into a complete asymptotically flat manifold @xmath11 without boundary and with non - negative scalar curvature , and such that @xmath142 , then @xmath11 must have a horizon .",
