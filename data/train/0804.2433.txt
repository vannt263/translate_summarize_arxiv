    "in many technical devices and machines possessing rotors , i.e. turbines , pumps , compressors , etc . , their actual dynamic condition determines their proper and safe operation",
    ". often , these machines have to work over the extended periods of time in various temperature regimes under large variable loading . as a consequence",
    ", the components of the machine are exposed to potential damage , such as for example transverse crack @xcite . for reliable and safe operation of such machines their rotors",
    "should be systematically monitored for presence of cracks and tested using non  destructive tests or vibration based techniques @xcite",
    ". structural health assessment of the rotating components may be performed by examining the dynamical response of the system subjected to external excitation applied to the rotating shaft .",
    "such a strategy requires solution and study of the dynamical behaviour of the rotor @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the cracked and uncracked rotors can appear in the region of internal or combination resonances @xcite .",
    "one should notice that the dynamics of the rotor is related to the coupling of torsional and lateral vibrations and the whole system is nonlinear .",
    "the crucial point is related to the model of the `` breathing '' crack , indicating that cracks involve additional parametric excitations with the frequency equal to an angular velocity of the rotor rotation @xcite .",
    "the crack introduces extra nonlinearity terms and produces coupling terms of lateral and torsional modes .",
    "tondl @xcite , cohen and porat @xcite and bernasconi @xcite showed that typical lateral excitations , such as unbalance , may result in both lateral and torsional responses of uncracked rotor . continuing these works muszynska et al .",

    "@xcite discussed rotor coupled lateral and torsional vibrations due to unbalance .",
    "their experimental results exhibited the existence of significant torsional vibrations , due to coupling with the lateral modes .",
    "further reported works have used this coupling under external excitation as a means to identify the presence of cracks @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that the spectral components of the shaft response under radial excitation can be used to identify the presence of transverse shaft cracks . in particular ,",
    "@xcite considered the vibrations of a slowly rotating shaft subject to either periodic or impulsive excitation .",
    "they identified specific harmonics in the response spectrum , which are combinations between the rotation speed and excitation frequency and they can be used to detect the presence of the crack . also , iwatsubo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite noted that the sensitivity of the response to the magnitude of the damage depends on the value of the excitation frequency chosen for the detection .",

    "the stiffness matrix for a jeffcott rotor with a cracked shaft in rotating coordinates can be written as : @xmath25    where the first matrix , on the left hand side , refers to the stiffness of the uncracked shaft , and the second defines the variations in shaft stiffness @xmath26 and @xmath27 in @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath30 is a crack steering function which depends on the angular position of the crack @xmath5 .",

    "using a simple model of the breathing crack we have showed that the response to periodic torque applied at the ends of rotating shaft is complex . in our results we observe on one hand the multi - frequency synchronization , and on the other hand quasi - periodic motion and nonlinear beats in the regions of resonances .",
    "especially the beats are characteristic as far as the nonlinear coupling of lateral and torsional modes induced by the crack is concerned .",
    "the beats are visible in both channels .",
    "they are also the signatures of interplay of external and parametric excitations , which arise from the crack existence .",
    "interestingly the beats causing the intermittency of the laminar phases introduce the non - periodic element of vibrations .",
