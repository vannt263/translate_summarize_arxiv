    "in the last few years magneto - optics started to become of prime interest in dealing with magnetic multilayer systems and magnetic nanostructures ( submonolayer coverages of substrates with magnetic material ) : kerr measurements not only turned out to be one of the standard experimental tools applied , new applications , in particular in the context of time - resolved techniques , are presently believed to lead to fast magnetization switching devices . in many cases , however , theoretical descriptions even for time - integrated magneto - optical effects are lagging behind the experimental efforts mainly because relevant schemes to deal with semi - infinite systems  not to speak of nanostructured materials  are not commonly used .",

    "unfortunately the experimental data @xcite are not specified with respect to surface orientations , i.e. , no surface normal is listed .",

    "[ fig : ref4ni - ptb12 ] in the vicinity of very low photon energies reveals that the fine structure around 0.5 ev seen in the experimental reflectance is missing in the theoretical curves although the maximum in the refractive index as a function of the photon energy is well reproduced .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiments is caused by an intrinsic feature of the applied approach : the finite lifetime broadening @xmath74 that enters luttinger s formula smears out possible fine structures for @xmath75 ( the value of @xmath76 is indicated in figs .",

    "[ fig : ref4ni - ptb12 ]  [ fig : eps - ptb12 ] the theoretical data refer to a total of @xmath77 pt layers , because from calculations for @xmath78 pt layers ( not shown in here ) no significant @xmath29 dependence of optical constants was found : the optical constants obtained for @xmath79 are almost as good as those obtained with @xmath80 pt layers in the system .",
    "an extensive analysis of the inter and intra  layer contributions to the permittivity @xmath81 showed that in the case of periodic layered systems ( simple lattices ) the @xmath82-like contributions to the permittivity are only functions of the relative position of layers @xmath3 and @xmath83 , i.e. ,  @xmath84 ; the layer  resolved permittivities @xmath85 are dominated by the corresponding intra  layer contribution @xmath86 . thus is not surprising that in the case of periodic layered systems , the following approximative form applies @xmath87 see fig .",
    "[ fig : err - ptb111 ] .",
    "it was also found that the difference between the exact permittivity and the approximated one defined above , not only is independent of @xmath29 , but also of @xmath88 .",
    "thus a semi  infinite periodic layered system can be simply modeled as a sequence of seven layers ( a central one plus three layers above and below this ) in a constant dispersionless permittivity background , the contribution of which to the total permittivity is negligible . because of the fast convergence in @xmath89 calculations for periodic layered systems restricted to @xmath79 layers can already yield reasonably accurate optical constants .",
    "it was shown analytically and numerically that in polar geometry and normal incidence the complex reflectivity coefficient of the right and left  handed polarized light for periodic _ ( _ layered _ ) _ systems is given by the fresnel formula : only in the case of periodic ( layered ) systems the @xmath0 matrix technique and the two  media approach become equivalent , i.e. , they lead to identical kerr spectra . this in turn clearly marks the limitations of the two  media approach , since applied to inhomogeneous layered systems , the corresponding kerr spectra are dominated entirely by the optical activity of the surface layer .",
    "inter and intra  layer contributions to the optical conductivity for fcc pt@xmath90/pt layered systems as calculated within the framework of the spin  polarized relativistic screened korringa  kohn ",
    "rostoker ( skkr ) method by means of a contour integration technique lead to optical constants , which are in very good agreement with available experimental data for photon energies @xmath91 ( @xmath74 _  _ being finite lifetime broadening_)_. the calculated optical constants for fcc pt@xmath90/pt do depend on the surface orientation ; for @xmath92 ( number of pt layers ) they become virtually independent of @xmath29 .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn for magnetic multilyer systems is rather simple : only the @xmath0  matrix technique that includes all multiple reflections and optical interferences can produce reliable spectra for this kind of systems .",
    "this in turn implies that a computational scheme such as the skkr method designed especially for systems with only two - dimensional translational symmetry has to be applied exclusively in order to evaluate the elements of the optical conductivity tensor .",
