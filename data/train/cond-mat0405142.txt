    "crystal growth by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) involves processes on quite different physical scales , from atomic to micrometer scales . to capture the large scale features it may be appropriate to represent the surface as a continuous height field @xmath0 above a set of so called base points @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "the surface dynamics is then modelled by a parabolic pde for @xmath0 , which often is a starting point interesting mathematical problems , and in some cases for rigorous results @xcite , which were an important part of this workshop .",
    "their mathematical tractability somehow contrasts with the lack of rigour in their derivations , as we shall see below .",
    "it would be nice to `` prove '' a certain pde to be the appropriate large scale model for some underlying more elementary model , typically a stochastic model of the solid  on  solid type .",
    "this would connect the result for large scales with the microscopic model which is much closer to physical reality .",
    "nevertheless , often this chain can be closed in a heuristic sense , and this lecture presents some examples .",
    "it is organised as follows : first , the heuristic procedure of deriving a continuum model is motivated and its structure is explained .",
    "then , two examples of applications are presented , covering in some sense extreme cases of applicability of continuum models ; ( i ) coarsening of mound patterns in homoepitaxy and ( ii ) damping of width oscillations in the transition from layer  by  layer to rough growth .",
    "last , the general applicability of continuum models to mbe growth is discussed , in particular those features of discreteness of the underlying process which can only be covered incompletely by a continuum model .",
    "open questions in the derivation which have not been addressed so far , but appear to be solvable , are mentioned here .",
    "the main purpose of this introductory lecture is to recollect the physical motivation of the class of models which deal with the largest spatial and temporal scales involved in mbe growth , and to give some intuition to other more mathematical approaches .",
    "continuum models for surface growth are comparable to the hydrodynamic limit of microscopic models of fluid dynamics . behind the continuous macroscopic height field @xmath0",
    "one has to imagine an ensemble of microscopic configurations which are locally in a steady state .",
    "figure  [ fig : ensemble ] illustrates this relationship .",
    "the local state is subject to changes on time scales , ideally longer than the relaxation times into those states , which leads to the dynamics of the height field .     as a representation.,width=302 ]",
    "the structure of the pde governing the dynamics of @xmath0 reflects different elementary processes and their symmetries . in growth from molecular beam epitaxy",
    "there is    * a deposition flux @xmath3 , i.e. , the deposited volume per time and surface area , * possibly an evaporation loss @xmath4 , again volume per time and area , * a surface current @xmath5 on terraces and along steps , transported volume per time and length , i.e. , cross section on the surface",
    ".    multiplied with a volume density @xmath6 these quantities become mass fluxes and currents .",
    "all three depend on the actual surface configuration @xmath7 , e.g. , on local slopes , their orientations and curvatures .",
    "elastic interactions and terrace adatom detachment with subsequent redeposition couple the dynamics at a surface point _ nonlocally _ to surface configurations at other places .",
    "there may also be an _ explicit _",
    "space dependence beyond the influence of the height configuration , e.g. , for a non  uniform deposition with pulsed flux .",
    "deposition , evaporation , and surface current are combined into a _ continuity equation _",
    "@xmath8 note that small local slopes are assumed , such that any geometric prefactors to the divergence of the surface current typically are neglected .",
    "a full derivation from local steady states in the sense postulated above is of course impossible in almost any case , apart from some one - dimensional examples @xcite .",
    "one therefore has to rely on heuristically justified ( _ reasonable _ ) assumptions for the dynamic quantities involved .",
    "the connection to the more detailed models on smaller scales is given by length scales which influence the surface morphology and become visible .",

    "@xmath69 is linearly unstable to fluctuations of wave lengths @xmath70 which therefore initially grow exponentially .",
    "once slopes of @xmath71 are reached the surface organises itself into a pattern of regular mounds and troughs which keep the symmetry @xmath72 of eq .",

    "plane isotropy of ( [ eq : siegert ] ) is locally broken by the need to arrange the mounds and troughs into a regular pattern and facets with sharp wedges form @xcite .",
    "subsequently the pattern of mounds and troughs coarsens keeping a single typical length scale and a statistically self similar pattern at every time .",
    "the average mound size is found to increase with time as @xmath73 @xcite . in a weak sense",
    "this can be proved as an upper bound for an appropriate time average of the length scales @xmath74 observed up to a give time @xmath75 @xcite . here",
    "only a quick handwaving argument is given following @xcite :    .",
    "the only macroscopic length scale is the domain size @xmath74.,width=302 ]    [ fig : csketch ]    the spatial average of the interface width @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 ) increases due to eq .",

    "[ fig : csketch ] the contributions of these terms are estimated to be of order @xmath79 : the facets are flat and the curvature is restricted to narrow strips of with @xmath71 at the domain boundaries , which have a relative weight of @xmath79 . also , here the slopes are smaller than the stable value @xmath80 attained at the facets .",
    "so all terms give a contribution of @xmath81 and because of the stable slope @xmath82 the increase in width leads to the estimate @xmath83 the same rough heuristic argument holds for anisotropic surface currents with discrete minima , i.e. , a discrete set of preferential surface orientations , but the four  fold symmetry ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : es ] ) plays a special role because two kinds of edges occur , such that in general the assumption of a single length scale @xmath74 in the system is wrong @xcite .",
    "layer by layer growth is technologically interesting because one can monitor the subsequent deposition of layers by oscillations in the surface width .",
    "it is nearly flat around integer fillings and the roughness takes maxima at half integer fillings . during growth the interface roughens and the width oscillations decay @xcite .",
    "the ehrlich  schwoebel barrier and",
    "mounding instability is one prominent mechanism destroying layer  by  layer growth , and so can be any inhomogeneity in the deposition intensity @xmath84 .",
    "although weaker , even the fluctuations of shot noise have this effect , and it can be captured by a simple renormalisation group calculation .    the simplest way to implement layer lattice effects into an continuum surface equation like eq .  ( [ eq : surfdyn ] ) is pursued by the conserved _ sine ",
    "gordon_equation @xmath85 among other the surface current is driven to regions of incomplete fillings such that @xmath86 is favoured to take integer values @xcite .",
    "the notation distinguishes between the lattice constant normal ( @xmath87 ) and parallel ( @xmath88 ) to the surface terraces which will be used in the following analysis .    in a momentum shell renormalisation",
    "one can average over the fluctuations caused by the short wavelength components of the noise , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 only contains modes of wavenumber smaller than some cutoff @xmath91 and @xmath92 the others .",
    "one now tries to approximate the dynamic equation for the averaged height field @xmath93 by an equation like ( [ eq : csg ] ) with suitably adjusted parameters .",
    "after rescaling , an effective _ renormalised _ equation is obtained .",
    "three important physical interpretations can be obtained from the renormalised parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : csg ] ) .",

    "\\(ii ) the strength of the lattice potential @xmath96 is damped out decays exponentially with coverage @xmath97 like @xmath98    \\(iii ) in a finite size sample smaller than the so called _ layer coherence _",
    "length @xmath99 renormalisation has to stop before the lattice potential has decayed .",
    "shot noise fluctuations can not accumulate to the point where width oscillations are completely blurred .",
    "in presenting the model derivations and examples of their application it becomes clear that continuum models are a good tool for questions where the inherent _ simplifications _ are justified .",
    "the insight gained from partial differential equations is different from results of more microscopic model .",
    "last not least continuum equations can handle larger systems and longer times than monte carlo simulations or even molecular dynamics .    in many cases",
    "the phenomena of particular technological interest can not be captured by continuum equations of the type described in this lecture .",
    "magic island shapes , surface reconstruction , step bunching , formation of quantum dots and wires are just a few examples .",
    "even if one is nt interested in these inherently discrete phenomena themselves they nevertheless carry over to the behaviour on larger scales and a naive straightforward derivation of large scale continuum models may be wrong .",
    "the implementation of noise for some questions , such as roughening , is one such example .",
    "also , the effective `` large scale '' ehrlich  schwoebel barrier of a step is influenced by kinks along the step which may serve as channels for downward incorporation of a terrace adatom .",
    "obtaining the correct effective barrier , dependent on orientation and curvature of the step certainly is a nontrivial task .",
    "an important part of the surface current @xmath58 flows along steps , as has become clear in the above derivation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the step current due to kink es barriers is derived as a function of the surface orientation or slope .",
    "an open question is the role of step curvature and therefore of surface curvature on the step current .    also on the surface itself , the regularising term as it is derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mullins ] ) , should be derived from true nonequilibrium arguments .",
    "to do so , one would have to incorporate island nucleations , the creation and annihilation of steps .",
    "one possible approach is to introduce fields for the densities of adatoms , advacancies , steps , kinks , and for their orientations .",
    "locally they could be treated as mean field densities with certain effective `` reaction '' rates , but in their spatial interaction , by diffusion and advective transport , one could obtain a conceptually more fundamental continuum model for surface growth .",
    "in this lecture an overview of continuum models for mbe surface growth has been given which includes    * the conceptual foundation of continuum models as a limit of more detailed small scale approaches , * heuristic derivations due to lack of rigorous or even exact ways to obtain them , * the structure and the symmetry of the equations obtained in that way , * two examples emphasising two opposite time limits in the growth process with the application of two contrary methods , * criticism of weak points in continuum modelling , open questions and some speculations about answers to them .",
    "the main purpose was to highlight the physical background and give some intuition of possible approaches to it as a basis for mathematical treatments , both rigorous and numerical .",
    "it should be seen as a complement of the lectures @xcite and @xcite which give a similar introduction to lattice and burton  cabrera  frank models respectively . although continuum models seem to fail in some important physical aspects they nevertheless are a good tool and subject for mathematical approaches .",
