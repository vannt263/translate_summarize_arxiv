    "2@xmath22@xmath22 supercells are built , and reciprocal spaces of the supercells are sampled by 2@xmath22@xmath22 meshes . to compute lattice thermal conductivities ,",
    "the reciprocal spaces of the primitive cells are sampled using the 20@xmath220@xmath220 meshes .",

    "the optimized lattice constants @xmath20=6.27 @xmath21 is used to do our dft calculations , and present energy band structures and density of states ( dos ) by using gga and gga+soc in and .",
    "@xmath0 is a indirect - gap semiconductor , with the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) at high symmetry point x and valence band maximum ( vbm ) at the @xmath22 point , and the energy band gap value is about 0.37 ev by using both gga and gga+soc .",
    "the dos s show that the strong hybridization of d states of zr and ni atoms produces the energy band gap .",
    "the bottom of the conduction bands are constructed mostly by zr - d and ni - d states , while the valence bands near the fermi level are dominated by the zr - d state hybridized with the ni - d and pb - p states .",
    "the soc can remove the band degeneracy .",
    "it is clearly seen that soc leads to a remarkable spin - orbital splitting value of 0.73 ev at high symmetry x point of valence bands near the fermi level , and 0.07 ev at @xmath22 point .",
    "the soc has weaker effect on the conduction bands near the fermi level than on the valence bands .",
    "compared to half - heusler @xmath23 ( a = ti , hf , sc , y ; b = sn , sb , bi)@xcite , a major difference is that the energy between vbm and the extremum of valence at x point is more close , which leads to different soc effects on seebeck coefficient .    here",

    "shows the seebeck coefficient s , electrical conductivity with respect to scattering time @xmath24 and power factor with respect to scattering time @xmath25 as a function of doping levels at the temperature of 300 k by using gga and gga+soc .",
    "the negative doping levels , being related with conduction bands , imply the n - type doping with the negative seebeck coefficient , and the positive doping levels , being connected with valence bands , mean p - type doping with the positive seebeck coefficient .    in narrow - gap semiconductors ,",
    "the large slope of dos near the energy gap may give rise to a large seebeck coefficient@xcite .",
    "calculated results show that the slope of dos by using gga+soc near the energy band gap is larger than that by using gga for both valence and conduction bands .",
    "calculated results show , in both p - type and n - type doping , soc has a enhanced influence on the seebeck coefficient s ( absolute value ) .",
    "this is different from half - heusler @xmath23 ( a = ti , hf , sc , y ; b = sn , sb , bi)@xcite , which is due to closer valence extremum between @xmath22 and x points(band degeneracy , namely band convergence , can enhance seebeck coefficient@xcite , and here is soc driven degeneracy . ) .",
    "however , the soc has a detrimental influence on the @xmath24 for both p - type and n - type doping , which can be explained by that soc leads to more localized bands .",
    "when soc is nt considered , the best power factor in p - type doping is larger than that in n - type .",
    "however , including soc , the best n - type power factor is larger than the best p - type one in considered doping range .",
    "similar soc effects on best power factor can be found in @xmath26@xcite , which agrees well with experimental results . in n - type doping",
    ", soc can reduce the power factor in low doping levels , but can also enhance one in high doping levels . in p - type doping , soc has more obvious effect on power factor , leading to a detrimental influence in the considered doping levels .",
    "the maximum power factor ( mpf ) by using gga+soc in p - type doping is about 13.8% smaller than that with gga .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider soc in the theoretical prediction of thermoelectric properties of @xmath0 .",
    "calculating @xmath27 from the first principles is challenging , but it can be attained by comparing the related experimental results . at room temperature , the measured electron conductivity and seebeck coefficient of @xmath0 are 220.1 @xmath28 and -153.9 @xmath29 , respectively , which gives a power factor 5.2 @xmath9@xcite . by comparing measured and calculated seebeck coefficient ,",
    "the doping level is determined to be -0.0097 , and the @xmath27 is attained for 0.333 @xmath2 @xmath3 s by making a comparison between experimental and theoretical electron conductivities . the power factor @xmath30 with the doping level -0.0097",
    "is calculated by using @xmath27=0.333 @xmath2 @xmath3 s , and the attained valve is 5.16 @xmath9 , being in agreement with experimental value 5.2 @xmath9 , which confirms the reliability of our calculated results .     as a function of doping levels with temperature being 200 , 400 , 600 , 800 and 1000 ( unit : k ) , and the scattering time @xmath14 is 0.333 @xmath2 @xmath3 s.,width=264 ]    here , we assume that the relaxation time @xmath27 is temperature and doping level independent .",

    "the power factor is as high as 24.3 @xmath9 for n - type doping , and 20.7 @xmath9 for p - type doping .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity can be assumed to be independent of doping levels , and typically goes as 1/t . at room temperature ,",
    "the corresponding lattice thermal conductivity is 14.5 @xmath1 , which is among the reported room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of half - heuslers ( 6.7 - 20 @xmath1)@xcite . at low t",
    ", the total thermal conductivity @xmath10 is dominated by the @xmath12 , but lattice thermal conductivity @xmath12 and electronic thermal conductivity @xmath11 have the same order of magnitude at high temperature region . at t=1000 k ,",
    "the @xmath4 is as high as 0.30 for n - type doping , and 0.27 for p - type doping .",
    "the high lattice thermal conductivity leads to relatively small @xmath4 value .",
    "finally , the power factor @xmath30 , electronic thermal conductivity @xmath11 and @xmath4 as a function of doping levels with temperature being 200 , 400 , 600 , 800 and 1000 ( unit : k ) are plotted in .",
    "it is found that electronic thermal conductivity increases with the increasing temperature .",
    "calculated results show that the higher @xmath4 can be attained in high doping levels at high temperature region .",
    "for thermoelectric device applications , although half - heusler @xmath0 has high power factor , high lattice thermal conductivity ( 14.5 @xmath1 at room temperature ) is a major disadvantage .",
    "it has been shown that lattice thermal conductivity can be reduced by point defects and boundaries .",
    "the binary or ternary alloying of hf , zr and ti in m site of n - type mnisn and p - type mcosb ( m = hf , zr and ti ) can reduce the thermal conductivity compared with a single element mnisn@xcite .",
    "the smaller grain size can effectively suppress the thermal conductivity .",
    "the thermal conductivity of @xmath32 is about 3.7 @xmath1 with an average grain size of 50 nm@xcite , and the room temperature thermal conductivity is also 3.7 @xmath1 at grain sizes below 200 nm for p - type @xmath33@xcite .",
    "therefore , experimentally , it is possible to reduce the thermal conductivity of @xmath0 by point defects ( doping @xmath0 with hf ) and boundaries ( reducing grain size ) .    in summary , we investigate thermoelectric properties of @xmath0 based mainly on the reliable first - principle calculations , including not only electronic but also lattice part .",
    "the electronic part , including power factor and electronic thermal conductivity , is calculated by using gga+soc , while lattice thermal conductivity is performed with gga .",
    "it is found that soc is very important for p - type power factor calculations , and has a obvious detrimental influence .",
    "calculated results show that @xmath0 has high power factor , but high thermal conductivity is a fatal disadvantage to gain high @xmath4 value .",
    "so , reducing the lattice thermal conductivity is very key to attain better thermoelectric performance .",
