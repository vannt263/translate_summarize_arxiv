    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering is essentially a deep core level spectroscopic method which is increasingly becoming an essential technique in understanding the complex electronic dynamics of a wide class of novel materials like cuprates , manganites and various other transition metal oxide compounds . in the rixs process",
    ", a highly energetic x - ray photon ( with energy @xmath0 ) excites a deep core level electron into the unoccupied states of the conduction band .",
    "the excited electron then undergoes inelastic scattering processes with various intrinsic excitations present in the system and finally , a conduction band electron fills up the core - hole and emits a photon with relatively lower energy .",
    "so , this is a two photon inelastic process with no core - hole present in the final state .",
    "the transfered energy and momentum to the intrinsic excitations of the system as well as the change in the polarization of the scattered photon can provide important information regarding these excitations . also , rixs being a resonant technique , the incident photon energy can be chosen to coincide with , and hence resonate with , certain intrinsic x - ray atomic transitions which in effect can greatly enhance the inelastic scattering cross section and hence can be used as a probe for charge , magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom on selective atomic sites .",
    "rixs has several advantages over other spectroscopic techniques like angle resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and neutron scattering .",
    "first , in arpes , the incident photon knocks out an electron from the system and hence can only probe the occupied states in a system but rixs , being a high - energy process can excite a system into unoccupied intermediate states ( like the upper hubbard band in a mott insulator ) and hence can be used as a probe for understanding complex electron dynamics in those strongly correlated intermediate states .",
    "inverse photo - emission techniques , in which an electron is injected into the system , can also access the unoccupied states of a system , but this method will charge the system and so far no momentum resolved inverse arpes with sufficient energy resolution has been developed . secondly , the scattering phase space , _ i.e. _ the range of energies and momenta that can be transfered in the rixs process , is much larger than other available photon scattering techniques involving visible or infrared light . as a result , rixs can probe low - energy excitations over a wider range of the brillouin zone and most importantly it can be used to probe all three directions of the brillouin zone , and hence can be used even for materials which are intrinsically three dimensional in nature as compared to the arpes which , because of the in plane momentum conservation , is widely used for materials which are inherently two dimensional in nature and for three dimensional materials analysis of arpes spectra are much more complicated ( the perpendicular component of momentum is integrated over in the arpes spectra ) .",
    "also , photons can much more strongly couple with the electronic system through coulomb interaction as compared to the neutron - electron interaction arising through the spin exchange interaction . as a result",
    ", rixs can be used on very small volume samples , thin films , surfaces and nano - objects in addition to bulk single crystal or powder samples .",
    "also , for materials for which growing large volume single crystals is a difficult task , rixs has significant advantage over neutron scattering .",
    "besides these , rixs is polarization dependent and hence can be used to probe magnetic excitations and also it can be used as a probe for certain specific elements or orbitals in a system .",
    "the main disadvantage of rixs over other techniques is , it requires substantially large incident photon flux in order to have comparable or better energy and momentum resolution . but",
    "recent progress in rixs instrumentation has dramatically improved upon this situation and rixs is beginning to become an important probe for condensed matter physics .    over the past decade or so , rixs has been carried out over large classes of transition metal oxide compounds like cuprates , manganites , irridates _ etc . _",
    "( see ref .   for a detailed review ) .",
    "most notably , rixs measurements have been performed at the @xmath1 k - edge  @xcite over a large class of cuprates like the undoped @xmath2 ,  @xcite @xmath3 ,  @xcite @xmath4 ,  @xcite @xmath5 ,  @xcite quasi one dimensional cuprates like @xmath6 ,  @xcite @xmath7 ,  @xcite hole - doped cuprates @xmath8 ,  @xcite @xmath9 ,  @xcite and electron doped cuprates @xmath10 ,  @xcite as well as at the @xmath1 @xmath11-edge  @xcite over various undoped cuprates @xmath12 ,  @xcite @xmath4 ,  @xcite @xmath2 ,  @xcite and doped systems @xmath13 , @xmath14 ,  @xcite @xmath8 ,  @xcite . besides these , rixs measurements at the @xmath15 @xmath16-edge in the orbitally ordered manganite @xmath17 ,  @xcite at the @xmath15 @xmath18 absorption edge in @xmath19  @xcite at the @xmath20 @xmath21-edge in @xmath22  @xcite and at the @xmath23 @xmath21-edge in the @xmath24 mott insulator @xmath25  @xcite have also been performed .",
    "a common feature of these materials is that all of them are either mott insulators or doped mott insulators and have interesting magnetic ground states .",
    "rixs measurements on these materials have probed energy and momentum resolved features of charge transfer excitations  @xcite , @xmath26 excitations  @xcite ( arising due to transitions between crystal field split @xmath27 orbitals ) , orbitons  @xcite in orbitally ordered systems and even magnetic excitations like magnons  @xcite and bi - magnons  @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches in understanding the rixs response are mainly either based on exact diagonalization of model hamiltonians over finite but small clusters  @xcite or based on a single particle approach  @xcite which includes realistic band structure effects but treats the correlation effects perturbatively under the random phase approximation  @xcite ( rpa ) or under a self consistent renormalization  @xcite ( scr ) approach and the effect of scattering from the core - hole in the first order born approximation or multiple scattering approximation .",
    "the exact diagonalization method treats the strong correlation effects exactly but because of the exponentially growing basis problem this method is limited to small size clusters and small number of orbitals and hence has limited momentum resolution .",
    "also , the effects of the core - hole in this approach as well as in the scr based calculations are taken either through an input core - hole lifetime , arising due to auger and fluorescence effects , which broadens the intermediate states or under the ultrashort core - hole lifetime ( ucl ) approximation  @xcite which is found to be perturbatively exact for small as well as large core - hole potentials .",
    "but the effect of the core - hole lifetime arising solely due to intrinsic strong correlation effects in a mott insulator on the rixs response has not been addressed so far and in this work we use the falicov - kimball  @xcite ( fk ) model to address this issue .",
    "the main motivation in choosing the fk model is that the fk model is one of the simplest models of strongly correlated electron systems which can be exactly solved  @xcite under the single site dynamical mean field theory  @xcite ( dmft ) approximation and most notably shows a mott insulating ground state for large interaction strength between the itinerant and the static electrons .",
    "also , the fully renormalized two particle dynamic charge correlation function involving the itinerant species as well as the finite temperature core - hole propagator in this model can be calculated exactly . in the following sections , we show that the calculated rixs response in the limit of large core - hole energy is  exact \" provided we : ( 1 ) neglect some momentum independent background contributions and ( 2 ) calculate the charge vertex for exchange processes ( see below ) under the hartree - fock approximation , which is correct in leading order .",
    "we believe this model specific calculation can shed some light onto our understanding of the strong correlation effects in the rixs response and the charge dynamics in a mott insulator in general .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "it is interesting to mention that the intermediate state @xmath50 has a core - hole while the initial and final states , @xmath51 and @xmath52 have no core - hole .",
    "the first - order amplitude is in general dominant over the second - order contribution except near resonance when the incident photon energy is nearly equal to a specific atomic transition in a material ; _ i. e. _ , @xmath53 . at resonance ,",
    "the second - order term becomes overwhelmingly large compared to the first - order term and hence the second - order term causes resonant scattering while the first order term gives rise to nonresonant scattering .    the diamagnetic term proportional to @xmath54 as well as the spin - orbit coupling term proportional to @xmath55 in eq .",

    "the latter is smaller than the former by a factor of @xmath56 and also , at resonance , the contribution from the diamagnetic term is negligibly small compared to the resonant term and hence their contribution will be neglected .",

    "it is interesting to mention that at zero temperature in the half - filled mott - insulating ground state , the chemical potential as well as the fermi level lies within the mott gap which results in a completely filled lower hubbard band ( lhb ) and a completely empty upper hubbard band ( uhb ) . as a result ,",
    "when the incident photon energy is within the lhb the rixs response will vanish due to the unavailability of any unoccupied state in the lhb to which the core electron can be excited and when the incident photon energy is within the upper hubbard band the rixs response will have a single peak structure arising due to particle - hole excitations across the gap in the presence of the core - hole potential . at finite temperature",
    "some of the states near the top of the lhb thermally excite across the gap and occupy the bottom of the uhb .",

    "this peak corresponds to the interband relaxation processes across the mott gap and grows very rapidly with increasing @xmath158 while the other two peaks decrease in intensity until we are finally left with a lone peak .",
    "hence , we can infer that in a mott insulator , interband relaxation processes across the mott gap are dominant over intraband relaxation processes .",

    "this behavior is quite different from the resonant response where the two - peak structure is most prominent near the zone corner and also the midinfrared peak in @xmath136 is much smaller and much less dispersive than the high - energy peak observed in the resonant response and most importantly the position of the peak can not be identified with any particular x - ray transition process .",

    "the height of the quasielastic peak close to the zone center decreases with increasing @xmath165 , which is related to the reduction of the overall rixs response with decreasing core - hole lifetime , while its width and dispersive features remains similar to the @xmath201 case .",

    "we have considered both the particle - hole symmetric half - filled case as well as the general particle - hole asymmetric case .",
    "we find that when the incident photon energy is lying within the upper hubbard band , the resonant response shows a two - peak structure arising from the intraband ( low - energy peak ) and interband ( high - energy peak ) relaxation processes ( as expected since the  gap \" is larger but the temperature is the same as before ) .",

    "<S> the calculated rixs response is accurate up to a local background correction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that on resonance the rixs response is greatly enhanced over various other non - resonant background effects and the response systematically evolves from a single peak structure , arising due to relaxation processes within the lower hubbard band , to a two peak structure , arising due to relaxation processes within the upper hubbard band as well as across the mott gap into the lower hubbard band , as we vary the incident photon frequency to access states from the bottom of the lower hubbard band to the top of the upper hubbard band . </S>",
    "<S> the charge transfer excitations are found to disperse monotonically outwards ( as a function of transfered energy ) as we go from the center of the brillouin zone towards the zone corner . </S>",
