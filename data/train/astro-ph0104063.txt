    "during its operational lifetime ( 26 january 1978 to 30 september 1996 ) the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ satellite observed over 3700 objects outside the solar system in its high dispersion mode . because a high percentage of these objects have been regularly observed by other satellites and from the ground ,",
    "a comparison of radial velocities obtained from this instrument is of considerable value to multi - wavelength and time - monitoring investigations that utilize _ iue _ data .",
    "however stable a spectrograph might be , its calibration is susceptible to systematic wavelengths errors , usually arising from such real - world complications as the differing paths of the stellar and emission - line calibration beams through the spectrograph , dispersion nonlinearities , and in the case of the _ iue _ , both image placement in the aperture and a wandering of its echelle spectral format on the detector surface . in this paper one of our goals will be to examine several potential sources of systematic error as a function of various instrumental parameters by means of standard cross - correlation tools .",
    "our purpose is to give a general evaluation of the robustness of the wavelength calibration of the _  newsips \" _ which , in contrast to its predecessor  iuesips \" software , is not known to produce wavelength errors as a function of time or other relevant variables .",
    "unlike other wavelength comparisons of the _ iue _ calibration , our study relies on cross - correlations of like spectra , that is , of the same star .",
    "cross - correlation studies have a high internal accuracy and offer safeguards against systematic errors in the measurement process .",
    "however , they also have the disadvantage of referring the measurements to a reference spectrum template for which the zero - point itself must be determined .",
    "thus , a second goal will be to evaluate the  absolute \" wavelength zero - point errors of the _ iue _ cameras in high - dispersion .",
    "this assessment has been carried out with respect to instruments on other space - borne platforms , specifically the _ goddard high resolution spectrograph ; ( ghrs _ ; operational period 19901997 ) and the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis _ ; 1997present ) on board the _ hubble space telescope_. we will also compare zero - points of the _ iue / swp _ wavelength  system \" with ground - based measurements of reference stars and absolute ( laboratory ) values compiled in the literature ( brandt et al .",
    "a list of actual camera sequence numbers for observations used in this work are available by request from the _ mast_. the spectra utilized were the ",
    "absolute calibrated \" flux extensions of the  mxhi \" fits files .",
    "a cross - correlation analysis offers both a convenient and efficient method of determining wavelength shifts for a series of test spectra with respect to a reference spectrum .",
    "this is largely because it utilizes the aggregate signal contained in the spectrum .",
    "no pre - conditions are required in terms of the shapes or positions of individual spectral features .",
    "thus , the presence of practical problems such as line blending or continuum placement do not degrade the accuracy of the solution as long as these as errors are independent of wavelength .",
    "even a limited signal - to - noise ratio will decrease the precision of the result , but it does not introduce a bias . to implement the cross - correlation analysis we used the _ iuedac _ idl routine _",
    "crscor_. this program is itself a  wrapper \" for a small idl collection of programs .",
    "it computes the cross ( auto ) correlation function according to its definition : that is , by shifting iteratively a test spectrum with respect to the reference by a series of regularly spaced wavelength increments and computing the sum of the product of the flux differences of the shifted and unshifted spectrum at each pixel within a specified wavelength or velocity range .",
    "this maximum of this function is located by least - squares polynomial fitting . for echelle data the natural unit is velocity , and",
    "so the pixel shift produced by the program is converted to km  s@xmath0 as an output option . as implemented , _ crscor _ truncates the start and ending wavelengths of the spectral array to the same values , thereby avoiding the generation of any false  noise \" due to wrap - around of shifted arrays .",
    "the program interpolates the test spectrum to the wavelength grid of the reference template to accommodate subpixel wavelength shifts .",
    "this step also facilitates comparisons with spectra from other instruments . to test these interpolations we cross - correlated several test spectra against copies of themselves by using a similar ( but not identical ) set of wavelengths from other observations of the same target .",
    "this comparison tests the accuracy of interpolating spectra observed at discrete wavelengths .",
    "we found that interpolations to one set of wavelengths produce false shifts of always less than @xmath3 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "our procedure was to run _ crscor _",
    "iteratively for each echelle order and to evaluate the net shift of the order as a whole wavelength segment . in our procedures we took care to screen the data for known pathologies of the _ iue _ cameras . for example",
    ", fluxes near the edges of the order ( particularly the long - wavelength end for the _ swp _ camera ) were avoided because the noise is high and also because systematic errors can be large in the blaze  ripple correction \" ( gonalez - riestra et al .",
    "such errors often mean sloped continua , which can lead to a small bias in line centroid positions .",
    "we also excluded small groups of pixels with negative data quality flags ( usually associated with instrumental",
    " reseaux \" ) because their fluxes are generally meaningless . in these cases",
    ", we interpolated the fluxes from neighboring pixels .",
    "this step has the effect of adding incrementally to random noise but does not introduce a random shift unless the interpolated regions in the two spectra being compared are extensive and have different slopes .",
    "apart from specific tests on zero - point shifts of interstellar line systems ( @xmath4[part2 ] ) discussed below , we did not exclude interstellar lines from our cross - correlations .",
    "although these lines are formed in a velocity frame shifted from the photospheric lines , the resulting wavelength shift can be assumed to be the same for different instruments because the cross - correlation routine does not distinguish between features formed in various velocity frames .",
    "for example , we did not have to exclude  wind \" lines because the shifts from orders including these lines did not differ noticeably from shifts of adjacent orders .    in comparing _",
    "spectra with spectra from the _ hst _ _ ghrs _ and _ stis _ instruments , we convolved the _ hst",
    "_ data by gaussian broadenings to make their resolutions equivalent to _ iue _ spectra .",
    "when all these steps were carried out , we experimented with _ crscor _ in an interactive mode for the investigations discussed in @xmath4[part2 ] . after finding that shifts arising from unflagged data pathologies are rare , we automated the program in order to compare large groups of spectra efficiently .      before an analysis of the zero - point errors of wavelengths in the _ iue _",
    "cameras can proceed , it is necessary to review the steps taken in the wavelength calibration of _ newsips _ data ; some of the following details have not been published in any form .",
    "the calibration of wavelengths in an echelle system requires the prior mapping of pixels from a two - dimensional detector surface to a series of one - dimensional arrays each of which is represented as a smoothly varying function of wavelength . in the raw detector geometry the echelle orders fall at unique angles relative to the electronic scan axis , and thus together they run nonparallel to one other . in addition , in certain places on the detector the spectral format can be displaced by local shears from slight nonuniformities within the optical coupling elements .",
    "all of these factors necessitate a detailed geometrical resampling of the raw echellogram image to a new surface in which the orders run parallel along a common dispersion axis and in which their fluxes have been reevaluated at a constant velocity increment .",
    "_ newsips _ maps the raw positions to a rectilinear geometry , thereby simplying the extraction of spectral fluxes ( for details see chapters 79 of garhart et al .",
    "wavelength calibration (  wavecal \" ) observations of the three cameras were made monthly during the mission through the small aperture by means of on - board platinum - neon ( pt - ne ) lamp source .",
    "early in the mission a tungsten flood lamp (  tflood \" ) exposure was added to the emission - line exposure in order to enable process software to determine the positions of reseau more easily . in april , 1990",
    "this practice ceased when studies within the _ iue _ project demonstrated that these pre - exposures added a noise component to the signal which effectively reduced the instrumental dynamic range and thus the number of measurable emission lines .",
    "with the linearized fluxes extracted , the wavelength system of each spectrograph camera could be calibrated by means of a reference calibration spectrum by remapping the @xmath5 positions of its emission lines from the original geometry to the rectilinear detector surface .",
    "for this step one may think of the dispersion axis as  @xmath6 \" and of the spatial ( or echelle order @xmath7 ) axis as  @xmath8 .",
    "\" wavelengths of the emission lines were taken from the study of reader et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , which was commissioned for the purpose of calibrating wavelengths of the _ hst _ spectrographs .",
    "the first of four steps in the _ newsips _ wavelength calibration procedure was interactive and consisted of running the _ iraf _ routine _ ecidentify _ to map the positions of a set of lines to wavelengths for a reference _ wavecal _ echellogram . in this step a quadratic cheybshev polynomial functon was used to map the @xmath5 pixel locations in the reference echellogram to a wavelength table .",
    "the second step was to utilize the _",
    "routine _ ecreidentify _ chebyshev solution determined for the reference echellogram in to determine predicted pixel positions for a few hundred lines in all the _ wavecal _ observations for a given camera .",
    "a polynomial fit was performed for each of the echellograms , resulting in a set of wavelength zero - points and mean pixel - to - pixel wavelength increments for each order . in practice , the wavelength zero - points for each  science echellogram \" were fit to a cubic polynomial in both time and camera - head temperature (  thda \" ) .",
    "these fits were adopted for all science data but of course not for the _ wavecal _ calibration observations themselves .",
    "this last step compensated for image shifts statistically by means of a previously derived least squares correlation of wavelength shift as a function of time and temperature .",
    "note that the wavelength calibration of the _",
    "wavecal_s technically applies to observations made through the small aperture .",
    "however , this calibration can be readily applied to large - aperture observations from prior measurements of the offset between the two apertures in the dispersion direction .",
    "we should pause to point out that whereas the wavelength calibration for _ newsips _ was performed with a simultaneous polynomial fit in both the wavelength and echelle order dimensions , the number of _ wavecal _ emission lines was sufficient to permit a calibration of wavelengths for most echelle orders separately ( smith 1991 ) .",
    "the first (  global \" ) approach is clearly the preferred one if pixel - to - pixel spacings on the detector are regular because a large number of lines can contribute to the solution for any individual order .",
    "however , during the _ iue _ lifetime the cameras suffered both electro - optical distortions and differential shifts arising from shears between fiber - optical bundles within the coupling - plate of the camera .",
    "a global wavelength solution tends to smooth over these small - scale distortions , causing correlated order - to - order errors in derived wavelengths .",
    "consequently , with exceptions noted by garhart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the _ ecidentify _ steps described above were implemented for individual spectral orders in the _ newsips _ calibration .      in this section",
    "we discuss various time - dependent characteristics of the _ wavecal _",
    "echellograms used to calibrate the science data .",
    "it should be emphasized that most of the following results were initially derived for use in removing low - order time - trends in the science data within the pipeline _ newsips _ processing of science spectra .",
    "the characteristics for _ wavecal _ spectra discussed below have only an indirect effect on the systematics and accuracy of the zero - points of science observations .    starting with the cross - correlation software described in @xmath4[xcr ] , we compared wavelengths for some 50 echelle orders in all small - aperture , optimally exposed _",
    "wavecal _ spectra ( 278 for lwp , 291 for lwr , and 468 for swp ) against the reference spectra used by garhart et al . ( 1997 ) in the _ ecreidentify _ step of their calibration .",
    "the cross - correlations showed that the zero - point shifts found for the _ swp _ data have the most complicated dependences of all three cameras and , in particular , that they exhibit fluctuations in wavelength as well as time .",
    "an example of the dissimilar dependences with time at different wavelengths for this camera is depicted in figure  [ ms1fig1 ] and requires some discussion . in analyzing the _ wavecal _ data",
    ", we found that it was necessary to discard the pre-1979.0 ( satellite commissioning period ) _ swp _ camera _ wavecal_s from further analysis because the zero - points otherwise showed a very steep increase during 1978 .",
    "we then fit the shifts for the remaining sample of 415 spectra with 7th - degree polynomial both in time and echelle order .",
    "no such complications were found for the long - wavelength cameras .",
    "the cross - correlation results for all three cameras are plotted with time in figures  [ ms1fig2 ] and [ ms1fig3 ] .",
    "figure  [ ms1fig2 ] was constructed by averaging the wavelength shifts such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ ms1fig1 ] over echelle orders .",
    "the complicated dependence of the _ swp _ camera wavelength zero - points as a function of time and spatial direction ( echelle order ) is reminiscent of the complicated decay of this camera s  null flux \" surface with time , as recently documented by gonzlez - riestra ( 1998 ) and smith ( 1999 ) . during 197980 the zero - point of the _ wavecal _ spectra increased smoothly by @xmath9 + 15 km  s@xmath0 ( about 2 pixels ) for order @xmath7 = 70 ( @xmath101170 ) , decreased by about -4 km  s@xmath0 during the mid-1980 s , and decreased rapidly during the last 23 years of the mission . for @xmath7 = 118 ( @xmath101970 ) , at the other end of the camera , the corresponding changes in zero - point are + 4.5 km  s@xmath0 , 0 km  s@xmath0 , and -2 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "one sees that the greatest changes occur in the  short - wavelength \" corner of the echelle surface , primarily during both the early and late stages of the _ iue _ mission . since changes occurred in the raw background flux at about the same epochs and in the same region of the camera as the changes we report here , it is possible that changes in the camera characteristics influenced the positions of the echelle format as well as the net fluxes of these orders as a function of time .",
    "in contrast , the _ wavecal _ zero - points for the long - wavelength cameras can be fit with low order polynomials , and they do not have a marked dependence on position on the detector .",
    "the _ lwp _",
    "camera is particularly well behaved in this respect since its wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ ms1fig2]a ) change linearly by + 3 km  s@xmath0 over the interval 19801996.8 .",
    "for the _ lwr _ camera ( fig .",
    "[ ms1fig2]b ) the wavelengths change by about + 4 km  s@xmath0 during 19781980 and remain almost constant thereafter .",
    "low - order ( cubic ) fits for the zero - point dependences of the _ wavecal_s for the three cameras were hard - coded into _",
    "newsips _ in order to remove such trends from the science data . for the _ lwp",
    "_ camera data the dependence on time is linear , so the trends could be removed completely .",
    "for the _ lwr _ camera the removal of trends is probably very good except for fitting the rapid increase during the first 23 years of the mission .",
    "a cubic polynomial can not fully remove this early - epoch trend . as implied above , the complex dependence for the _ swp _ camera can not be accurately fit with a cubic polynomial function , particularly either early or late in the mission .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the cubic fit to the shifts in figure  [ ms1fig2 ] .",
    "the differences between this line and the zero - points of the individual _ wavecal _ spectra imply that , independent of other error sources , _ swp _ data can be expected to have small ( @xmath11 @xmath12 km  s@xmath0 ) epoch - dependent errors .    aside from temporal trends in the mean shifts , one can see from figures  [ ms1fig2 ] and [ ms1fig3 ] that the r.m.s .",
    "scatter characteristics of zero - points among _ wavecal _ spectra also change with time .",
    "considering the _ swp _ camera results first , fig .",
    "[ ms1fig2 ] shows that starting sometime in 198890 the scatter decreased to only about 60% of its initial value of @xmath13 km  s@xmath0 . also , the statistical outlying points ( defined as those differing from the epochal mean by at least 1 pixel or 8  km@xmath0 ) decreased in occurrence from over 10% of all obervations to only about 4% .",
    "it is possible that these changes are caused by the termination of adding _ tflood _ lamp exposures onto the _ wavecal _ spectra .",
    "other changes were made during this period , such as taking these observations under more tightly defined constraints in thda and focus , might have contributed to the improved scatter characteristics as well .",
    "the scatter for _ lwr wavecal _",
    "data seems to decrease well before 1990 , so the practice of adding _ tflood _ does not seem to be important . also , notice that the scatter for the _ lwp _ camera actually seems to have _ increased _ markedly in 1990 .",
    "the suddenness of this change , particularly in the _ lwp _ camera , suggests that the change in adding _ tflood _ flux _ might _ have contributed to the scatter of the _ wavecal _ zero - points for the calibration of this camera .",
    "there is no doubt that for radial velocity or wavelength studies involving _ iue _ data , the _ newsips _ processing is much superior to that of _ iuesips_. the wavelength calibration coefficients were periodically updated during the mission in _ iuesips _ , so datasets spanning several years can not have consistent wavelengths . in this section",
    "we quantify the zero - point differences between _ iuesips _ and _ newsips _ calibrations during the mission .    for this purpose we chose hot stars that the _ iue _ observed over nearly the entire satellite lifetime .",
    "the first two stars , 10  lac ( 09  v ) and @xmath14  sco ( b0.2 v ) , are sharp - lined spectral standards with no known radial velocity variations .",
    "we obtained all _ swp _ high - dispersion observations from the _ mast _ database after 1979.0 ( except for swp  01205 , 01765 , & 02051 for which _",
    "iuesips _ data were not available ) and cross - correlated pairs of _ iuesips _ and _ newsips _ fluxes in spectrum segments in orders @xmath7 = 50119 .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ ms1fig4 ] .",
    "the series of dotted vertical lines mark the dates in which then newly - derived wavelength calibrations were implemented into _ iuesips _ processing .",
    "we also cross - correlated 33 echellograms from both processing systems for six white dwarfs which were analyzed by holberg , barstow , & sion ( 1998 ; hereafter  hbs \" ) .",
    "these stars are wd 0005 + 511 , wd0044 - 121 , wd0621 - 376 , eg-102 , gd-394 , and wd2211 - 495 , and in all cases their spectral lines are sparse and broad .",
    "thus , we found it advantageous to cross - correlate the same 50 orders of these spectra as those utilized for our study of 10  lac and @xmath14  sco .",
    "we also cross - correlated a few orders dominated by interstellar lines .",
    "we found a mean zero - point difference , _ iuesips _ - _ newsips _",
    ", among the sample of hsb white dwarfs of + 9.5 @xmath15 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this compares rather well with the difference of + 9.1 km  s@xmath0 given by hsb ( referred to @xmath101400 ) .",
    "the dependences of zero - point with time for both white dwarfs and hot main sequence stars in fig .",
    "[ ms1fig4 ] are likewise similar to the hbs results .",
    "thus , the form of this zeropoint - difference curve is insensitive to the sample of stars chosen .",
    "rather , it is largely determined by the dates of the revisions of the _ iuesips _ calibration constants were implemented ( see vertical dotted lines in the figure ) .",
    "notice that the net difference , _ iuesips - newsips _",
    ", is positive for all epochs and increases during the late-1980 s to a rather well determined maximum of + 18@xmath15 km  s@xmath0 at 1992.5 .",
    "it then decreases quickly during 1993 and is perhaps constant thereafter .",
    "the _ iuesips _",
    "wavelength calibration was unsettled prior to 1983 , producing a large scatter compared to the homogeneously - calibrated _ newsips _ system .",
    "we also compared _",
    "iuesips__newsips _ wavelength zero - point differences for the two long - wavelength cameras ; we believe this is the first such study of its kind .",
    "this endeavor turned out to be far more difficult because of the paucity of data over an extended time for any given star . as a result",
    ", we were unable to extract information on the time evolution of the wavelength zero - point differences for these two cameras . to determine a _ iuesips _ - _ newsips",
    "_ mean difference for the two long - wavelength cameras , we considered the k2  iii star @xmath16  boo as well as three of the four photometric calibration (  _ phcal _ \" ) standards for the _ iue _ mission , @xmath17  cas , @xmath14  sco , and @xmath18  uma .",
    "a number of echelle orders of spectra of the hot stars do not contain many lines in this spectral region , so we selected several orders interactively that gave a reasonable signal in the cross - correlation function and used them alone .",
    "the averages of the _ iuesips _ - _ newsips _ differences can be summarized as follows .",
    "for the _ lwp _ camera invesigation we obtained + 0.5 km  s@xmath0 for @xmath17  cas ( 126 spectra ) , + 3.2 km  s@xmath0 for @xmath14  sco ( 91 spectra ) , + 3.6 km  s@xmath0 for @xmath18  uma ( 165 spectra ) , and 4.6 km  s@xmath0 for @xmath16  boo ( 19 spectra ) .",

    "values from the _ lwp _ camera to the _ lwr _ camera .",
    "the shift for the _ lwr _ camera is almost certainly significantly different from zero . as with the _ swp _ camera , the difference(s ) are likely to arise from periodic changes in the _ iuesips _ wavelength calibration .",
    "each of the three _ iue _ cameras included a pair of science apertures in the telescope plane , a small (  _ smap _ \" ) and large (  _ lgap _ \" ) aperture .",
    "the smap was used primarily during the first few years of the mission because of concerns about the wavelength stability for large - aperture observations .",
    "thus , acquisition / guiding errors might result in light losses , but they would not so seriously affect wavelength accuracy as they would for the _ lgap_. with experience in acquiring objects in the _ fine error sensor _",
    "( _ fes _ ) , the _ iue _ project realized that better wavelength precisions could be obtained than initially anticipated , and observations through the large aperture eventually became routine .",
    "a related operational issue was the different centroiding modes in which the _ fes _ was used to acquire targets prior to guiding . in particular , the so - called  underlap \" and",

    "although the underlap mode in principle causes an offset in the target position , pains were taken to correct for this offset . to optimize these complimentary acquisition strategies ,",
    "the project settled on a suitable magnitude demarcation of m@xmath25 = 4.5 .",

    "the mean shift for any one of these stars is accurate to about @xmath12 km  s@xmath0 or better .",

    "the quoted errors are sums ( added in quadrature ) of both _ lgap _ - _ smap _ differences and zero - points of individual _ smap _ observations . from this work it is clear that no major systematic aperture - to - aperture differences are detectable for any of the three cameras .",

    "the _ swp _ data for two well - observed stars , hd  60753 and bd+75@xmath30325 in table  [ tab2 ] , show clear negative trends with time ( see figure  [ ms1fig5 ] ) that can not be readily attributed to observational practices or instrumental conditions .",
    "a similar trend may also be present in the data of the a5  v star hd  11636 ( not shown ) , for which the far - uv fluxes are faint .",
    "we might speculate that this apparent trend is actually the norm for uv - faint sources .",
    "for example , it is possible that these trends , if real , are by - products of an unexplained source of scattered light , i.e. ,  the streak , \" which appeared in 1991 .",
    "in fact , the scattered light from this artifact introduced a gradient in the light admitted across both the small and large apertures required that _ iue _ telescope operators to adopt a new acquisition reference point in the _ fes _ to avoid shifts in the spectra of several km  s@xmath0 ( pitts 2000 ) .",
    "this displacement is similar to the change in zero - points documented for hd  60753 and bd+75@xmath30325 .",
    "overall , we find that all but one of the 11 stars in the sample represented in table  [ tab2 ] shows a negative slope . when subjected to a statistical  sign test `` ( dixon and massey 1951 ) , '' the signs of these slopes are weakly significant at the 2@xmath29 level .",

    "this sequence of events led to a curtailment in the camera s use and an abbreviated time interval used to monitor instrumental trends of well observed objects . among our sample of program bright stars and white dwarfs",
    ", we were able to find only two stars , @xmath17  cas and @xmath14  sco , with an appreciable number of same - aperture observations before and after the flare .",
    "of these two targets , @xmath17  cas is the better sampled in time .",
    "its cross - correlation shifts exhibited no trend with time , but they did exhibit a pronounced increase in scatter ( about a factor of two ) after 1984.0 . the data for @xmath14  sco showed an apparent slope of -1 km  s@xmath0  yr@xmath0 , but this could be an artifact of a greatly increased scatter after 1984.0 .",
    "an examination of the shifts as a function of wavelength for this star revealed no wavelength - dependence",
    ". this would be surprising if the flare were the cause of wavelength shifts .",
    "our conclusion from this investigation is that the wavelength zero - points of _ lwr _ observations taken after the 1983 flare event are less reliable than before .",
    "however , this may not be a direct consequence of the flare itself .",
    "rather , we suspect that the increased scatter arises from the decreased usage of the camera and the resulting lower accuracy of the necessary redetermination of positions in the _ fes _ used to acquire an object .",
    "early in the _ iue _ mission it was discovered that the camera image format shifts frequently in both the spectral and spatial directions with time and camera temperature .",
    "camera temperature was measured roughly by thermistors located in any of several areas of the camera head amplifier ( not an ideal location to measure the temperature of the spectrograph bench itself ) , and one of these was selected to provide a consistent refererence .",
    "this provided a ",
    "thda \" index which could be used to calibrate wavelength zero - point shifts and apply them to the processing of a particular observation in _ iuesips _ and _ newsips_. motion of the spectral format on the detector was generally caused by telescope flexures and , under routine operating conditions , secondarily by changes in electro - optical properties of the camera .",
    "thus , fluctuations in satellite temperature ( which was primarily a function of the telescope s orientation angle with respect to the sun ) caused the telescope to expand or contract and the focus to change .",
    "the focus was usually controlled indirectly by turning on or off a heater located behind the primary mirror .",
    "an alternate control procedure consisted of toggling a heater mounted on the spectrograph deck .",
    "although the camera temperature and detector image shifts were correlated , a hysteresis arising from the instrument s thermal history tended to weaken the efficacy of controlling the focus by commands to the spacecraft .",
    "this control was weakened further by other environmental factors , such as the earth s eccentric orbit around the sun and earthglow .",
    "consequently , the _ iue _ operations team developed a conservative strategy of maintaining the thda temperature within certain limits . during the course of the _ iue _",
    "mission statistical correlations were derived from shifts of _ wavecal _ spectra as a function of the _ thda _ and focus parameters .",
    "these shifts were parameterized by means of a polynomial fit , so _",
    "newsips _ could remove them to first order in its assignment of wavelengths .    as part of our cross - correlation analysis , we searched for a correlation between zero - point shifts and _ thda _ and focus values at the time of an observation . generally , we were unable to find a convincing correlation . except for an accident of an unrelated contemporaneous research program",
    ", this search might have stopped with this null result .",
    "however , while investigating spectral variations in b stars for another research program , we used the cross - correlation tools from the present study to shift spectra to the same wavelengths before manipulating the data further . in doing so , we noticed a time - dependent cycle of about a day ( see figure  [ ms1fig6 ] ) in the results for a time series of 22 observations conducted in 1995 on the b3ve star @xmath16  eri .",
    "in searching through the _ iue _ archival database further , we found an extraordinary set of 181 continuous observations on the b0.5v star @xmath32  per in 1996 obtained by dr .",
    "figure  [ ms1fig7 ] shows that the same one - day cycle is present in the data for this star .",
    "a string of observations of hd  93521 at 1994.2 ( not shown ) exhibits a similar 1-day period and few km  s@xmath0 semiamplitude over three days .    because the cycle lengths in these shifts are all close to one day , we investigated first whether the satellite s orbital motion might have somehow been neglected in determining wavelengths for an individual observation .",
    "however , we were able to discount that possibility .    a more successful attempt to explain the apparent 1-day velocity cycles of @xmath16  eri , @xmath32  per , and hd  93521 was to investigate the effects of varying the instrument temperature by adjusting the telescope focus . cycling the camera - deck heater produced correlated responses of the thda and telescope - focus values , especially when the ambient spacecraft temperature was lower than nominal , as for the 1996 observations of @xmath32  per . during this particular monitoring series , the good correlation between temperature and",
    "focus indicates that the focus was controlled by the deck heater . in the time series on @xmath16",
    "eri the temperature was not quite so low .",
    "then an adequate means of controlling the focus was to cycle the more distant telescope mirror heater .",
    "since the telescope heater was isolated from the spectrograph , the locally measured _ thda _ value did not correlate well with the focus changes of the telescope ( see lower dashed line in figure ) .",
    "however , in either case the principle was the same , that heating could be applied to prevent the focus from drifting to large negative values .",
    "the important point is that this application caused an overcorrection of the focus .",
    "the focus values would then swing ( relatively ) positive until a low ambient temperature again reversed the change of the focus , causing a new thermal - focus cycle to ensue .",
    "all told , the changes in focus from either thermal - control technique caused the velocity to become first too negative and then too positive by a few km  s@xmath0 .",
    "although we have found the velocity - focus correlation only in _ swp _",
    "camera datasets so far , it is probably present in long - wavelength data as well .",
    "figure  [ ms1fig8 ] exhibits the correlation explicitly between telescope focus value and zero - point for the observing campaign on @xmath32  per .",
    "a similar plot can be constructed for thda instead of focus , but the @xmath16  eri data imply that the correlation of velocity with thda for the @xmath32  per data is a result of temperature excursions changing the focus , and _ not _ a shift caused by the temperature variation within the camera . note especially that fig .",
    "[ ms1fig8 ] shows that the correlation arises only in the limited focus range of -2.0 to -3.7 ( instrumental units ) .",
    "as noted above , we also searched our results for a dependence on focus and thda values in our study of time - dependent correlations , but we found none .",
    "we suspect the reason is that _ iue _ observations of most objects were obtained at different epochs and with different target - centering practices .",
    "this would tend to conceal any correlation over a small critical subrange of focus values in our searches for trends in the stars of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "however , we expect the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ ms1fig8 ] is present in all high - dispersion data to some extent .",
    "if so , it is a a secondary source of radial velocity error .",
    "in our earlier discussion we focused only the temporal results because we did not find any systematic dependences on wavelength . in figure  [ ms1fig9 ]",
    "we demonstrate this further by exhibiting the averages and confidence belts ( @xmath33 ) of shifts for 16 stars at each wavelength interval in our _ swp _ camera study . the mean r.m.s . over wavelength for all stars",
    "is @xmath34 km  s@xmath0 while the adjacent order - to - order shift is only @xmath3 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "these errors are generally wavelength - independent except below @xmath351230 . below this wavelength",
    "the errors increase because the detector loses its sensitivity to flux .",
    "because there is no clear trend in wavelength , we will refer to the zero - point error in terms of apparent _ velocity _ rather than wavelength .",
    "a comparison of the velocity fluctuations resulting from the cross - correlations among different stars suggests that the precision of a zero - point determination varies as a weak power of the reciprocal of the _ net _ flux ( detector counts ) .",
    "in addition , we find that order - to - order shifts are measurably larger for spectra of white dwarfs and rapid rotators ( e.g. , @xmath18  uma , @xmath17  cas ) .",
    "this fact suggests that the random cross - correlation errors increase slightly with line broadening , namely from about @xmath28 km  s@xmath0 ( e.g. , @xmath14  sco ) to @xmath36 km  s@xmath0 ( e.g. , @xmath18  uma ) .",

    "2000 , holberg , barstow , & sion 1998 ) have reported that _",
    "newsips_-processed , high - dispersion _ swp _ images have negative zero - points errors relative to other standards .",
    "both rely upon measurements of centroids of individual interstellar lines , generally in spectra of ob stars .",
    "gonzlez - riestra et al .",
    "reported differences of -17.7@xmath59 km  s@xmath0 for the _ swp _ camera with respect to ground - based measurements of interstellar lines in the optical spectra of the same stars .",

    "a correction of + 17.7 km  s@xmath0 was applied to all _ swp _ high - dispersion spectra in the _ iue newly extracted spectra _ (  ines \" ) system ( gonzlez - riestra et al .",
    "2000 ) .    upon investigation we are unable to support the conclusion by gonzlez - riestra et al . that a significant difference in radial velocities exists for _ newsips swp _ spectra",
    "we have attempted without success to reconcile the differences between their results and ours .",
    "these authors kindly provided us with program data lists , so we were able to compare cross - correlation shifts from their samples with those from entire sets of obervations of these stars in the archives .",
    "a comparison of the results showed no noticeable difference between the two samples of observations , and thus one must look elsewhere to resolve the difference .",
    "next , we cross - correlated the same interstellar lines used in the gonzlez - riestra et al .",
    "analysis for in a sample of 145 large - aperture _ swp _ spectra of 10  lac with the interstellar lines in the brandt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) _ ghrs _ atlas .",
    "for the three sets of lines they measured ( si  ii @xmath10125960 , o  i @xmath101302 , si  ii @xmath101304 , and c  iii @xmath1013356 ) , we found a difference rv@xmath39 - rv@xmath43 = -0.9 @xmath50 km  s@xmath0 . thus , there is essentially no difference between the systemic velocities of these interstellar lines and the photospheric lines in the _ iue _ spectrum for these two instruments .",
    "gonzlez - riestra et al .",
    "did not measure _ swp _ observations of 10  lac , but their measurements of lines in hd  93521 and hd  60753 spectra suggest that the wavelengths in these stars typify the zero - point offsets they found for their total sample of six stars : -18.8 km  s@xmath0 for hd  93521 and -12.9 km  s@xmath0 for hd  60753 . in @xmath4[simtyp ]",
    "we reported that the relative velocities of the _ photospheric _ lines for these three stars were in agreement with ground - based studies , so in this important respect all our comparisons are self - consistent ( as are those of gonzlez - riestra et al . ) .    since we can find no other discrepancy among our results with respect to the atlas results or with respect to photospheric lines of the stars in our common sample , we are left with the possibility that the measurement positions of the interstellar lines by gonzlez - riestra et al .",
    "are misleading for some subtle reason .",
    "one possibility is that the multi - component nature of the interstellar clouds toward these stars gives different centroid velocities for some groups of lines than for others . in particular",
    ", differing degrees of saturation among interstellar lines at low spectral resolutions can give rise to rather large centroid velocities differences among various interstellar line complexes in the spectrum of a given star .",
    "for example , differences between the @xmath101304 and @xmath1013356 complexes are quite large in the spectrum of hd  93521 , as was indeed noted by gonzlez - riestra et al . themselves .    in @xmath4[iuenew ]",
    "we noted a very similar time - dependence of apparent velocities between _ iuesips _ and _ newsips _ spectra with respect to the dependence noted by holberg , sion , & barstow ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors also found a mean difference of -8.3 km  s@xmath0 @xmath60 between _ newsips _ -derived and ground - based radial velocities for four white dwarfs .",
    "this finding appears to contradict the conclusion from our work on 10  lac and other bright b stars ( @xmath4[swpan ] ) that the velocity zero - point for _ swp _ _ newsips _ is correct within -1 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we have attempted to track down the source of this discrepancy in a number of ways .",
    "first , in @xmath4[aperr ] we discussed the possibility that the mode of centering on bright stars and faint stars could lead to different results ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . yet , we found no such effect",
    ". we may also consult fig .",
    "[ ms1fig4 ] for clues of an apparent velocity difference between white dwarfs and bright ob stars .",
    "the figure implies that the mean of the white dwarf velocity offset should agree within about @xmath15 km  s@xmath0 of our 10  lac result .",
    "this statement holds true for the velocity average of the four white dwarfs selected by hsb .",
    "we have also cross - correlated the groups of interstellar lines considered by hsb in selected echelle orders .",
    "these comparisons produce a mean _ iuesips _ - _ newsips _ velocity shift of -1.3 @xmath61 km  s@xmath0 relative to differences derived from orders containing only photospheric lines .",
    "thus , there is nothing special or  peculiar \" about the spatial mapping of the ism lines in _ newsips _ that would give results systematically different from an analysis of photospheric features over the whole spectrum .",
    "unable to resolve a disagreement with hsb s results in this manner , we proceeded with another test . in their discussion of the apparent wavelength error ,",
    "hsb compared their results with two earlier studies of interstellar lines in their white dwarf sample .",
    "the more accurate of these was a study by lemoine et al .",
    "( 1996 ; small science aperture observations ) of the ism line spectrum of the white dwarf g191-b2b . to make a comparison with _ newsips _ wavelengths , we acquired the lemoine et al .",
    "data from the the mast archives .",
    "these observations were originally made by substepping the grating to minimize fixed pattern detector noise , so we made corrections for these shifts by comparing emission line spectra obtained at nearly the same time for wavelength calibration ( this comparison was made by measuring centroid line positions of the two groups of spectra interactively ) .",
    "the differences we determined were applied to the raw data in order to form high - quality , co - added spectra .",
    "we next cross - correlated 13 _ swp lgap _ spectra of the star with the mean _ ghrs _ spectrum in narrow wavelength regions centered on 12 interstellar features studied by these lemoine et al .",
    "these cross - correlations gave a mean shift , rv@xmath22 - rv@xmath43 , of -2.3 @xmath62 km  s@xmath0 , i.e. zero within the errors ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "this finding is at mild variance with the hsb prediction of -8.2 km  s@xmath0 , but it is consistent with our other results .",
    "cross - correlation tools have been used to determine whether systematic trends in wavelength zero - points exist with respect to camera aperture , time , focus , and thda for high - dispersion _ iue / newsips _ data for all three cameras .",
    "not surprisingly , a major residual error source is in an implied inconsistency in target - centering / guiding among different observations , some of which could arise from different thermal histories of the telescope .",
    "even so , the wavelength calibration of the _ swp _ high - dispersion data is surprisingly good .",
    "in fact , it can rival the wavelength precision of the _ large _ aperture _ ghrs _ spectra for stars observed many times over several epochs and in consistent instrumental conditions . even over 1015 years , we found evidence of significant velocity trends for only one or two stars ( @xmath4[timetr ] ) . at most these trends",
    "could amount to @xmath3835 km  s@xmath0 over this duration , and they may actually be smaller .",
    "we have also found that dedicated time - series observations of bright stars can substantially reduce apparent velocity errors . yet , even for such data strings , changes in the spacecraft environment can produce spurious variations of @xmath28 km  s@xmath0 over a timescale of a few hours .",
    "it is not clear that series of long - wavelength spectra exist in _",
    "iue _ database to detect such effects , but we expect that they are present nonetheless .    using the _ ghrs _ atlas of 10 lac as an secondary standard , we have found that the apparent radial velocity determined from high - dispersion images of the _ iue _ _ swp _ camera is zero , within the errors of measurement , with respect to the ultraviolet wavelength system defined by contemporary laboratory catalogs ( brandt et al .",
    "this result has been checked by lower - accuracy comparisons such as the difference between apparent radial velocities from _ swp _ echellograms of two other presumed constant early - type stars with similar spectral type , hd  93521 and hd  60753 , and also by comparing wavelengths of several interstellar lines with those measured by the _ ghrs_. additionally , and for all three _ iue _ cameras , we have confirmed the accuracy of the zero - points with more limited sets of lines with the _ ghrs _ and _ stis _ atlases of procyon and arcturus , respectively .",
    "we have compared the zero - points of the two _ iue _ long - wavelength cameras by means of the arcturus and procyon atlases and also by compared wavelengths within a common narrow wavelength order among the three cameras .",
    "neither of these comparisons led to a siginificant radial velocity offset between the _ iue _ and _ hst _ instruments .",
    "the long - wavelength camera results are also in agreement with the ground - based velocity of procyon , but less precisely so .",
    "our estimate of the accuracy of in the zero - point error for the _ lwp _ and _ lwr _ cameras is itself imprecise , but judging from its consistency with the _ arcturus _ and _ procyon _ atlas wavelengths , it is probably no worse than @xmath53 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "our findings are in apparent disagreement with those of gonzlez - riestra et al .",
    "their results led to shifts in the wavelength scales of the _ swp _ high - dispersion and _ lwp / lwr _ low - dispersion data for the _ ines _ ( _ iue newly extracted spectra _ ) data product produced by the _",
    "european space agency_.    we have found no noticeable wavelength - dependent differences in zero - point between _ iue swp _ camera data for 10  lac and the _ ghrs _ atlas of this star . however , note that this finding does not address possible errors within a particular order or measurements of a common feature appearing in adjacent orders , such as the mg  ii h line ( see gonalez - riestra et al .",
    "although we have not examined the data for this purpose , we have noticed occasional mismatches of 510 km  s@xmath0 from one end of an echelle order to another compared to theoretical spectral line syntheses .",
    "such errors probably originate from an inadequacy of the calibration algorithms to determine dispersion nonlinearities accurately because only a few lines were available in individual orders of _ wavecal _ echellograms .",
    "finally , because the _ ghrs _ atlas of 10  lac has a broad wavelength coverage and shows good correspondence in its wavelengths compared to laboratory data , we recommend the use of this atlas as a reference standard for comparison of astronomical mid - uv wavelengths with data from other missions .",
