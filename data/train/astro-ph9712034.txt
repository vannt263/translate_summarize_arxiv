    "galaxies in rich clusters at low redshifts have stellar and structural properties significantly different from objects in the nearby field . although it is well established that galaxy evolution _",
    "depends on the environment , it is still not clear which / how / when / how - much environmental effects determine or influence the main galactic properties . in clusters",
    "an unexpected strong evolution from intermediate redshifts to @xmath2 has been detected regarding the star formation activity ( from a large number of studies beginning with those of butcher & oemler ) and , more recently , the relative fractions of the various morphological types .",
    "_    the `` morphs '' group  amy barger , harvey butcher , warrick couch , alan dressler , richard ellis , gus oemler , ray sharples , ian smail and myself  has used images from the hubble space telescope wide field and planetary camera 2 to study the evolution of galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "the catalog with positions , photometry and hubble types is presented in smail et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , while the morphological evolution and the morphology - density relation are discussed in dressler et al .",
    "constraints on the formation epoch of the early type galaxy populations can be placed from their colour homogeneity ( ellis et al . 1997 ) and their structural parameters ( barger et al . 1997 ) .",
    "an analysis of gravitational lensing by the clusters is given in smail et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .    here",
    "we report on some first results from a large optical spectroscopic survey of 10 clusters ( see table ) , which should be cited as preliminary results of the morph s collaboration .",
    "the spectral catalog and some basic properties of the sample will be described in dressler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; the analysis of the dataset and the interpretation in terms of the star formation history will be given in poggianti et al .",
    "redshifts and equivalent widths of the main lines have been measured for the @xmath3 new spectra , as well as for the sample of dressler & gunn ( 1992 , dg92 ) .",
    "the spectra have been classified into 6 main spectral classes according to their emission and absorption line properties and have been compared with both our spectrophotometric model ( barbaro & poggianti 1997 ) and a local sample of field galaxies ( kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "in particular we identified the cases with a recent ( post  starburst ) or current ( starburst ) strong episode of star formation .    for a subsample of @xmath4 galaxies ,",
    "the _ spectral type can be compared with the _ morphological type determined with the hst : a major goal is to investigate the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of their hubble type and explore the connection between the strong _ morphological evolution observed ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) and the stellar population content .",

    "the main preliminary results for cluster members are the following :    @xmath7 as in previous spectroscopic surveys of clusters at intermediate redshifts ( couch & sharples 1987 , dg92 ) , a large population of post - starburst objects is found : about a third of the sample show evidence of a recent starburst which ended during the last 2 gyr .",

    "@xmath7 a large number of spectra ( 10% ) exhibit exceptionally strong higher order balmer lines in absorption _ and the [ oii]@xmath83727 line in emission . on the basis of our model",
    "we interpret them as objects which have had a recent intense starburst and present some current ( residual ) star formation activity at a much lower level .",
    "there is a number of low redshift examples of similar spectra , such as those of some merging galaxies ( fig .",
    "_    @xmath7 the bulk of the early type galaxies ( ellipticals and the few s0 s found in these clusters ) have passive spectra , with no obvious signs of current or recent star formation .",

    "@xmath7 of the many spirals , the majority have spectra which are either `` too active '' or `` too passive '' as compared to low  redshift field spirals .",
    "the entire population of starburst galaxies and most of the post - starburst population is composed of spirals ( fig.2 ) .",
    "another significant fraction of the late type galaxies present a level of star formation activity which is too low for their hubble type compared to local field spirals .",
    "@xmath7 morphologically disturbed objects  asymmetric or distorted  are numerous in these clusters ( smail et al . 1997 ) but except for a few clear cut examples of mergers , the interpretation of the cause of the disturbance remains subjective .",
    "most of the starburst spectra and a large fraction of the post - starburst spectra belong to galaxies which appear morphologically strongly disturbed .",
