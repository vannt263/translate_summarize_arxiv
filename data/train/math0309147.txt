    "the original motivation for this paper was to understand the results about a chaos decomposition for general lvy processes obtained by nualart and schoutens @xcite . a relation between multiple wiener integrals for the brownian motion and the symmetric fock space , and its role in the chaos decomposition ,",
    "are well known . for more general lvy processes , a representation on a symmetric fock space was introduced by parthasarathy , see @xcite .",
    "we will show that in this representation , the chaos decomposition has a very natural interpretation , and its proof becomes more immediate .",
    "a recent preprint @xcite , which came to our attention when the paper was nearing completion , handles a number of related questions , although by quite different methods .",
    "a number of preceding papers which deal with related topics are cited in the references .",
    "our second goal was the extension of these results to certain non - commutative stochastic processes . here",
    "the starting point is the @xmath0-fock space construction introduced by boejko and speicher @xcite .",
    "they also introduced the @xmath0-brownian motion , which reduces to the usual brownian motion for the bosonic case @xmath1 , to the fermionic brownian motion for @xmath2 , and to the analog of the brownian motion in free probability for @xmath3 . in a previous paper @xcite , following the ideas of parthasarathy and schrmann @xcite",
    ", we introduced lvy processes on the @xmath0-deformed fock spaces .",
    "since we are able to express the chaos decomposition property in the fock space language , the same method gives the corresponding result for the @xmath0-deformed processes .",
    "moreover , this decomposition can then be used to obtain a number of consequences .",
    "combinatorial stochastic measures were introduced for the usual stochastic processes by rota and wallstrom @xcite . in this paper , we obtain an explicit formula for such measures for the @xmath0-lvy processes , unifying a number of previous results .",
    "@xmath4th power of a process can be expressed as a sum over stochastic measures . on the level of operators ,",
    "this turns out to be precisely the decomposition of the product of operators in terms of their wick products .",
    "since the @xmath0-lvy processes consist of non - commuting operators , they generate non - commutative von neumann algebras , and any information about these algebras is of interest .",
    "it was known that for the @xmath0-brownian motion , or for the free probability case @xmath3 , these algebras are ii@xmath5-factors . we show that in contrast , in all other cases these algebras have no normal tracial states , and thus are infinite algebras .",
    "further information about these algebras awaits discovery .",
    "there are three standard classes of infinitely divisible distributions ; see @xcite for one interpretation of these classes .",
    "the intermediate one , with fourier transforms @xmath6\\ ] ] for @xmath7 a finite measure , was considered by kolmogorov .",
    "it consists of the distributions with mean @xmath8 and finite variance .",
    "this is the class whose @xmath0-analogs are treated in this paper . for simplicity",
    "we treat only one - dimensional such processes , although there is no real difficulty in extending the results to @xmath4 dimensions .    the narrowest class , with fourier transforms @xmath9,\\ ] ] for @xmath7 a finite measure , consists of the compound poisson distributions , considered by de finetti . in this case",
    "there is a more natural construction in which the starting object is an algebra with a fixed state .",
    "the analogs of some results of the paper for this class are treated in the appendix .",
    "finally , all infinitely divisible distributions have fourier transforms of the form @xmath10\\ ] ] for @xmath7 a finite measure , by the lvy - khinchine theorem .",
    "representations of all of the corresponding lvy processes on the symmetric fock space are described in section 21 of  @xcite .",
    "there is no difficulty with extending the definitions to the general @xmath0 case , but since the usual treatment involves measures which are no longer finite , we do not treat this case in this paper .    *",
