    "multi - antenna wireless systems have become very popular due to their high spectral efficiencies and improved performance compared to single - antenna systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "practical multi - antenna systems are faced with the problem of maintaining multiple radio frequency ( rf ) chains at the transmitter and receiver , and the associated rf hardware complexity , size , and cost @xcite .",
    "spatial modulation , a transmission scheme which uses multiple transmit antennas but only one transmit rf chain , can alleviate the need for multiple transmit rf chains @xcite-@xcite . in spatial modulation , at any given time , only one among the transmit antennas will be active and the other antennas remain silent .",
    "the index of the active transmit antenna will also convey information bits , in addition to the information bits conveyed through the conventional modulation symbol ( e.g. , chosen from qam / psk alphabet ) sent on the active antenna .",
    "an advantage of spatial modulation over conventional modulation is that , for a given spectral efficiency , conventional modulation requires a larger modulation alphabet size than spatial modulation , and this can lead to spatial modulation performing better than conventional modulation @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we take the view that spatial modulation is an instance of the general idea of ` index modulation ' . unlike in conventional modulation",
    "where information bits are conveyed only through symbols from modulation alphabets defined in the complex plane ( e.g. , qam , psk ) , in index modulation ( i m ) , additional information bits are conveyed through indices of certain transmit entities that get involved in the transmission .",
    "transmit antennas in multi - antenna systems , subcarriers in multi - carrier systems , and precoders are examples of such transmit entities that can be used to convey information bits through indexing .",
    "indexing in spatial domain ( e.g. , spatial modulation , and space shift keying which is a special case of spatial modulation ) is a widely studied and reported index modulation technique ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "much fewer works have been reported in frequency and precoder index modulation techniques ; e.g. , subcarrier index modulation in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and precoder index modulation in @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is twofold : @xmath0 generalization of the idea of spatial modulation , which we refer to as generalized spatial index modulation ( gsim ) , and @xmath1 generalization of the idea of index modulation to both spatial domain ( multiple - antennas ) as well as frequency domain ( subcarriers ) , which we refer to as generalized space - frequency index modulation ( gsfim ) .    in spatial modulation ,",
    "the choice of the transmit antenna to activate in a channel use is made based on a group of @xmath2 bits , where the number of transmit antennas is @xmath3 .",
    "on the chosen antenna , a symbol from an @xmath4-ary modulation alphabet @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xmath4-qam ) is sent .",
    "the remaining @xmath6 antennas remain silent .",
    "therefore , the achieved rate in spatial modulation , in bits per channel use ( bpcu ) , is @xmath7 .",
    "the error performance of spatial modulation has been studied extensively , and it has been shown that spatial modulation can achieve performance gains compared to spatial multiplexing @xcite,@xcite .",
    "space shift keying is a special case of spatial modulation @xcite , where instead of sending an @xmath4-ary modulation symbol , a signal known to the receiver , say + 1 , is sent on the chosen antenna .",
    "so , the achieved rate in space shift keying is @xmath8 bpcu . in spatial modulation and space shift keying , the number of transmit rf chains is restricted one , and the number of transmit antennas is restricted to powers of two . the first contribution in this paper",
    "consists of generalization of spatial modulation which removes these restrictions @xcite-@xcite , an analysis of achievable rate , and proposal of a detection algorithm . in generalized spatial index modulation ( gsim ) , the transmitter has @xmath9 transmit antenna elements and @xmath10 transmit rf chains , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 out of @xmath9 antennas are activated at a time , thereby @xmath12 additional bits are conveyed through antenna indexing .",
    "spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing turn out to be as special cases of gsim for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we derive the expression for the achievable rate in gsim and easy - to - compute upper and lower bounds on this rate .",
    "we show that the achievable rate in gsim can be more than that in spatial multiplexing , and analytically establish the condition under which this can happen .",
    "it is noted that gsim achieves this higher rate using fewer transmit rf chains compared to spatial multiplexing .",
    "we also propose a gibbs sampling based detection algorithm for gsim and show that gsim can achieve better bit error rate ( ber ) performance than spatial multiplexing .    in the second contribution in this paper , we introduce gsfim which uses both spatial as well as frequency domain to encode bits through indexing .",
    "gsfim can be viewed as a generalization of the gsim scheme by exploiting indexing in the frequency domain as well .",
    "index modulation that exploits the frequency domain alone  referred to as subcarrier index modulation ( sim )  has been studied in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these works have shown that ofdm with subcarrier index modulation ( sim - ofdm ) achieves better performance than conventional ofdm , particularly at medium to high snrs .",
    "these works have not exploited indexing in the spatial domain in mimo systems .",
    "our contribution addresses , for the first time , indexing both in space as well as frequency in mimo systems .",
    "in particular , we @xmath15 propose a signaling architecture for combined space and frequency indexing , @xmath16 study in detail its achieved rate in comparison with conventional mimo - ofdm , and @xmath17 show that better performance compared to that in conventional mimo - ofdm can be achieved in the medium to high snr regime .",
    "the proposed gsfim system has @xmath18 subcarriers , @xmath9 transmit antennas , and @xmath10 transmit rf chains , @xmath19 . in the spatial domain , @xmath10 out of @xmath9 transmit antennas are chosen for activation based on @xmath20 bits . in the frequency domain , in a space - frequency block of size @xmath21 , information bits are encoded in multiple sub - blocks where each sub - block is of size @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the number of sub - blocks .",
    "we characterize the achievable rate in gsfim as a function of the system parameters .",
    "we show that gsfim can offer better rates and less transmit rf chains compared to those in conventional mimo - ofdm .",
    "it is also shown that gsfim can achieve better ber performance than mimo ofdm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ gsm_1 ] , we present the gsim system model , and a detailed analysis of achievable rate and rate bounds in gsim .",
    "we quantify rate gains and savings in transmit rf chains in gsim compared to spatial multiplexing . the proposed detection algorithm for gsim and its ber performance",
