    "obtaining a consistent notion of probabilities is a fundamental problem in quantum cosmology .",
    "the usual copenhagen interpretation is inadequate for a quantum universe since there is no possible division of a quantum cosmos into an observed quantum system and a classical external observer .",
    "measurement by the latter or a classical detector which plays an essential role in copenhagen interpretation by killing the interference between alternative histories and hence leads to the assignment of probabilities , no longer remains meaningful in a closed quantum system .",
    "the consistent histories approach is based on generalizing the above procedure of eliminating the interference between alternative histories without the baggage of observer based measurement .",
    "@xcite instead , this task is achieved by a decoherence functional which measures the interference between different alternatives .",
    "these sets of alternatives define histories , specified by class operators constructed from a time sequence of projection operators . in case",
    "the interference vanishes , histories decohere and consistent probabilities can be assigned .",
    "recently , we have used the consistent histories formulation to compute the probability for a non - singular bounce to occur in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) .",
    "@xcite loop quantization of various cosmological spacetimes has been performed,@xcite and the result that these cosmological models bounce at small volume , first seen for the spatially flat isotropic model , @xcite has been generalized in various directions .",
    "however , in most of the works , analysis of the quantum theory essentially stops with computation of expectation values of observables and associated fluctuations .",
    "the consistent histories approach has filled an important gap in lqc by providing precise answers to compute quantum probabilities in lqc .",
    "the probability of a bounce in the spatially flat isotropic model sourced with a massless scalar turns out to be unity , @xcite in striking contrast to the wheeler - dewitt theory where the probability of a bounce is zero for an arbitrary superposition of expanding and contracting universes ( analogous to schrdinger s cat states ) .",
    "@xcite instead , the probability of a wheeler - dewitt universe to encounter a singularity turns out to be unity .",
    "so far , these computations were performed in the conventional canonical formulation of lqc using an exactly solvable model .",
    "@xcite the goal of this work is to extend these results to a covariant formulation using a spin foam avatar of lqc .",
    "@xcite our analysis is based on earlier works building on this relationship between lqc and spin foams . @xcite    the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the primary construction expressing lqc in langauge of spin foams",
    ". @xcite starting from the quantum hamiltonian constraint @xmath0 in solvable lqc , @xcite we write the hadamard propagator treating @xmath0 as a hamiltonian .",
    "the hadamard propagator is equal to the physical inner product obtained using group averaging , and can be written as a sum over volume transitions by a careful rearrangement of summation in a vertex expansion of the inner product . in sec .",
    "iii , computation of the theory s class operators and probabilities is summarized ( see craig and singh ( 2016)@xcite for details )",
    ". using the hadamard propagator , decoherence functionals are computed and the probability of a bounce is shown to be unity .",
    "the probability of a singularity to occur is found to be zero .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in sec .  iv .",
    "a useful way to write the hadamard propagator is to express it as a sum of positive and negative frequency components , @xmath37\\ , e^{}_{k}(\\nu_f ) e^{}_{k}(\\nu_i)^ * \\\\ & = & \\nonumber g^+_{\\mathrm{h}}(\\nu_f,\\phi_f;\\nu_i,\\phi_i ) + g^-_{\\mathrm{h}}(\\nu_f,\\phi_f;\\nu_i,\\phi_i ) ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 are the eigenfunctions of the @xmath3 operator with eigenvalues @xmath39 . using the vertex expansion in eq.([gh_amp ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the path amplitude associated with the path @xmath41 with @xmath34 transitions , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , such that there are @xmath44 unique volumes @xmath45 is given by@xcite @xmath46 note that @xmath47 .",
    "the degeneracy of each volume @xmath48 in the given path is denoted by @xmath49 , hence @xmath50 .",
    "the amplitude over the sum of gauge histories obtained by treating @xmath0 as the hamiltonian can thus be obtained from the matrix elements @xmath51 .",
    "for a given family of volume histories @xmath52 associated with @xmath34 volume transitions for states with positive frequencies , the class operator is given by @xcite @xmath53 summing over all the families of histories , we obtain the hadamard propagator for positive frequency states , @xmath54    using the properties of the hadamard propagator , we are now equipped to answer questions about the probability of bounce ( or lack of it ) in this exactly solvable model of lqc .",
    "we start with picking a reference volume , labeled by @xmath55 , and classify paths according to whether @xmath56 is greater or less than @xmath55 at @xmath57 .",
    "that is , whether @xmath58 or @xmath59 ( and similarly for @xmath60 ) .",
    "the class operator for histories for which @xmath61 and @xmath62 is : @xmath63 thus , the class operator for a history which bounces is , @xmath64 on the other hand , the class operator for the alternative history that the universe is found at small volume at either or both of @xmath65 , @xmath66 is @xmath67    it is important to note that for _ any _ fixed volume @xmath60 , by the riemann - lebesgue lemma , since at fixed volume the factors in the integrand multiplying @xmath68 are integrable functions of @xmath69 , the propagators vanish in the limit @xmath70 . as a result , all the class operators appearing in @xmath71 are zero in the limits @xmath72 and @xmath73 for any finite @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 in contrast , the class operator corresponding to a bounce @xmath75 is not zero .",
    "therefore , _ all _ states are driven to infinite volume as @xmath76 .",
    "the probability for the bounce to occur , @xmath77 , is captured by the decoherence functional element @xmath78 : @xmath79 computation of the decoherence functional reveals that this probability is unity , @xcite whereas the elements @xmath80 and @xmath81 vanish . @xcite the probability that in any volume transition , a zero volume eigenvalue is reached is zero . in this sense ,",
    "the probability for a singularity to occur turns out to be vanishing .",
    "expressing lqc in the language of spin foams @xcite opens a new window to explore answers to questions about consistent histories in a covariant framework . given the rigorous detailed construction of the quantum theory available in slqc , @xcite the underlying task to define class operators and calculate the decoherence functional becomes tractable .",
    "the decoherence functional can be computed to find the histories which decohere and assign respective probabilities to such histories .",
    "this task has been accomplished for the first time in covariant formulation of slqc .",
    "@xcite using histories classified via number of volume transitions , we find the probability for a bounce to be unity .",
    "this confirms with our previous results on consistent histories in lqc using the canonical approach .",
