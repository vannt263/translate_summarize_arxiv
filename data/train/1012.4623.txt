    "over the past decade , there has been an explosion of interest in complex networks for describing structures and dynamics of complex systems . despite differences in their nature ,",
    "many networks may be characterized by similar topological properties .",
    "for instance , real networks display highly clustering than expected from classic random graphs @xcite .",
    "also , it has been widely observed that node - degree distributions of many large networks are heavy tailed @xcite , e.g. , exponential and power - law . to understand how these phenomena arise , research devoted to evolving networks",
    "has rapidly flourished @xcite .",
    "the basic premise is that the network will continue to grow at a constant rate and new nodes attach to old ones with some possibility .",
    "when the newly added nodes connect with equal probability to nodes already present in the network , the degree distribution of the nodes of the resulting network is exponential .",
    "whereas for newcomers connecting to old ones with linear preference of the node degree , barabsi and albert ( ba ) observed a power - law distribution of connectivity @xcite .    in the real world ,",
    "agents , represented by nodes , always age after growth . for instance , in scientific citation networks there is a half - life effect : old papers are rarely cited since they are no longer sufficiently topical ( or they are more often referenced through secondary literature ) . on the world wide web popular web sites ( for example , search engines )",
    "will often loose favor to newer alternatives . to study the effect of this phenomenon on network evolution ,",
    "the ba model has been modified by incorporating time dependence in the network @xcite .",
    "dorogovtsev and mendes studied the case when the connection probability of the new node with an old one is not only proportional to the degree @xmath2 but also to a power of its present age @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the age of a node ) @xcite .",
    "they found that the network shows scale - free ( sf ) behavior only in the region @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath7 , the distribution @xmath8 is exponential .",
    "yet , the gradual aging model show lower clustering than realistic networks . on the contrary , klemm and eguluz considered evolving networks based on the memory of nodes and proposed a degree - dependent deactivation network model @xcite which",
    "is highly clustered and retains the power - law distribution of the degree ( but no consideration of exponential degree distributions ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a simpler and more fundamental mechanism to build networks , including sf networks , while retaining the positive features of aforesaid models .",
    "the mechanism we propose simulates realistic networks , and can be understood analytically .",
    "it has been shown that in some networks , the popularity ( or activity ) of a node is essentially determined by the so - called fitness@xcite which is intrinsically related to the role played by each node , such as the innovation of a scientific paper or the content of a webpage .",
    "this allows us to represent the activities of individuals by intrinsic fitnesses and suggest a fitness - driven deactivation approach to build structured networks .",
    "compared with topological information , the intrinsic fitness provides a more natural and appropriate deactivation criterion for aging of nodes .",
    "we show that depending on the node - fitness distributions two topologically different networks can emerge , the connectivity distribution following either an exponential or a generalized power law . in both cases ,",
    "the networks are highly clustered .",
    "irrespective of the fitness distribution , we observe two scaling laws of the clustering coefficient , @xmath9 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the node degree and @xmath3 corresponds to the number of active individuals in the network .",
    "hence , this mechanism offers an explanation for the origin and ubiquity of such clustering in real networks .",
    "rather than connectivity - dependent deactivation dynamics of the nodes developed in @xcite , the present deactivation model is based on the individual fitnesses . for each node",
    "@xmath10 a fitness @xmath11 , the random number drawn from a given probability distribution function @xmath12 , is assigned to measure its popularity or activity .",
    "the deactivation mechanism is characterized by the transition of a node from the active to the inactive state interpreted as a collective forgetting of it .",
    "the network starts from an initial seed of @xmath3 nodes , totally connected by undirect edges , which are all active . then at each time",
    "step the dynamics runs as follows .",
    "\\(i ) add a new node @xmath10 , which connects to @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) nodes randomly chosen from the @xmath3 active ones .",
    "by @xmath15 we denote the in - degree of a node , i.e. , the number of edges pointing to it .",
    "the in - degree of the newcomer is @xmath16 at first .",
    "each selected active node @xmath17 receives exactly one incoming edge , thereby @xmath18 . since the out - degree of each node is @xmath13 always , the total degree of a node is @xmath19 .",
    "\\(ii ) activate the new node and deactivate one ( denoted by @xmath17 ) of the @xmath3 old active nodes with probability @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normalization factor .",
    "the summation runs over the set @xmath22 of the @xmath3 old active nodes .    during evolution ,",
    "a node might receive edges while it is active , and once inactive it will not receive edges any more . note that the fitter the individual is , the more difficult for it to be deactivated . for the case of the citation network , eq .",
    "( [ deactprob ] ) means that the famous paper with great innovation is less possibility to be forgotten .",
    "denoting by @xmath23 the probability of active nodes with degree @xmath2 and fitness @xmath24 at time @xmath25 , we can write out the master equation for network evolution @xmath26(1-\\frac{m}{n } ) + a(k , x , t)[1-\\pi(x)]\\frac{m}{n}. \\label{mastereq}\\ ] ] at each time step , an active node is deactivated and a newcomer joins the set @xmath22 to keep the number @xmath3 unchanged . according to eq .",
    "( [ deactprob ] ) , the normalization factor @xmath27 varies with time because of the change of the nodes in the active set .",
    "however , the fitness of each node is a random number taken from a given probability distribution @xmath12 , therefore the normalization @xmath27 fluctuates very slightly and can be treated as a constant . substituting eq .",
    "( [ deactprob ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) yields @xmath28 imposing the stationarity condition @xmath29 , we obtain the equation @xmath30^{k - m}a(m , x)\\ ] ] for the probability of active nodes with degree @xmath31 and fitness @xmath24 in the stationary state , where @xmath32 is the stationary probability of active nodes with degree @xmath13 and fitness @xmath24",

    "we assume that @xmath38^{-m } \\ln[f(x)]^{-1}\\rho(x ) .",

    "\\(i ) _ exponential degree distribution .",
    "_ we set @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are positive constants .",
    "consequently , the integral of eq .",
    "( [ integralpks ] ) is @xmath46 following an exponential . according to the definition of @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 the solution of which reads @xmath49 then the normalization factor becomes @xmath50^{-1 } \\right\\}^{-1},\\ ] ] yielding @xmath51 according to the definition of @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 which suggests @xmath54 according to the normalization",
    ", @xmath12 should satisfy @xmath55 .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ expressx ] ) and ( [ expressrho ] ) , we finally obtain the distribution of @xmath12 , @xmath56 that is to say , the fitness of each node is identical .",
    "considering the constant approximation of @xmath27 , the above result can be generalized to homogeneous distributions of fitnesses . here",
    ", homogeneity implies that the node fitnesses have small fluctuations around the mean @xmath57 , hence the small variance .",
    "we conclude that for any given @xmath12 distributing homogeneously , the fitness - driven deactivation generates structured exponential networks .",
    "\\(ii ) _ power - law degree distribution .",
    "_ we set @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are positive constants .",
    "accordingly , eq . ( [ integralpks ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath63 in the limit @xmath64 , one has @xmath65 . for any finite @xmath2 , the integral @xmath66 is convergent and smaller than @xmath67 .",
    "thus the connectivity distribution has a power - law form @xmath68 combining eqs .",
    "( [ deff ] ) and ( [ defg ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 this heavy tailed distribution implies large fluctuations of the node fitnesses , hence heterogeneity .",
    "we conclude that the fitness - driven deactivation can build structured sf networks if the node fitnesses are distributed heterogeneously .",

    "all the fitnesses have been normalized . for uniform and gaussian distributions with the same mean ( @xmath71 ) and",
    "small variances ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , the node fitnesses fluctuate slightly around the mean and can be regarded as the homogeneity ; whereas for exponential and power - law distributions , there are large fluctuations of the node fitnesses due to the right - skewed feature , resulting in the heterogeneity .",
    "the experiment networks start from the initial @xmath74 nodes and end with the total population @xmath75 . ]     on @xmath13 . in the inset ,",
    "the data reported on the log - log representation show a power law @xmath76 , and the best linear fit gives @xmath77 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we give the simulation results of degree distributions @xmath8 for four kinds of distribution functions @xmath12 of node fitnesses . in case that the distributions of fitnesses are homogeneous , e.g. , uniform ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) and gaussian ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) , the linear - log plots imply an exponential degree distribution .",
    "conversely , when the fitnesses distribute heterogeneously , the log - log plots of figs . [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) , corresponding to exponential and power - law cases respectively , predict a generalized power law .",
    "we obtain the slopes of the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by least squares fitting and plot them as a function of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for homogeneous fitnesses ,",
    "we notice a scaling relation between the slope and @xmath13 , whereas for heterogenous fitnesses , the slope shows independence on @xmath13 .",
    "in a network , if a node @xmath10 has @xmath78 edges , and among its @xmath78 nearest neighbors there are @xmath79 edges , then the clustering coefficient of @xmath10 is defined by @xmath80 in the deactivation model , new edges are created between the selected active nodes and the added one .",
    "let us first consider the case of @xmath81 .",
    "at each time step , the degree @xmath78 of the active node @xmath10 increases by @xmath82 and @xmath79 increase by @xmath83 until it is deactivated .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary dynamics of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given by @xmath84 integrating eq .",

    "the clustering coefficient @xmath91 of the whole network is the mean of @xmath89 with respect to the degree distribution @xmath8 , @xmath92 substituting eqs .",

    "it is worth noting that both the scaling laws are independent of fitness distribution functions .",
    "one obtains the same result for uniform , gaussian , exponential and power - law distributions of fitnesses .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an alternatively simple and intuitive model for a large and important class of networks widely observed in the real world .",
    "we defined the intrinsic fitness as the way of quantifying the popularity of individuals , i.e. , the fitter a node is , the higher possibility it is active .",
