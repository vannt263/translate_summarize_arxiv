    "the dual meissner effect due to condensation of color magnetic monopoles is conjectured to be the color confinement mechanism in qcd @xcite .",
    "the scenario is easily understood if we consider qcd after abelian projection @xcite .",
    "the abelian projection of qcd is to extract an abelian theory performing a partial gauge - fixing such that the maximal abelian torus group remains unbroken .",
    "after the abelian projection , @xmath5 qcd can be regarded as a @xmath6 abelian gauge theory with magnetic monopoles and electric charges .",
    "thooft conjectured that the condensation of the abelian monopoles is the confinement mechanism in qcd@xcite .",
    "there are , however , infinite ways of extracting such an abelian theory out of @xmath5 qcd .",
    "it seems important to find a good gauge in which the conjecture is seen clearly to be realized even on a small lattice .",
    "a gauge called maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge has been shown to be interesting @xcite .",
    "recently an effective @xmath7 monopole action is derived from vacuum configurations in @xmath0 qcd@xcite .",
    "entropy dominance over energy of the monopole loops , i.e. , condensation of the monopole loops is shown to occur always in the infinite volume limit if extended monopoles@xcite are considered@xcite .",
    "after the abelian projection in the ma gauge , infrared behaviors of @xmath0 qcd may be described by a compact - qed like @xmath7 theory with the running coupling constant instead of the bare one and with the monopole mass on a dual lattice .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the string tension which is a key quantity of confinement is explained by monopole contributions alone@xcite .",
    "this is realized also in compact qed @xcite .",
    "the aim of this note is 1 )  to show that the same thing happens also in finite - temperature @xmath0 qcd by means of evaluating monopole and photon contributions to abelian wilson loops , 2 )  to study what kind of monopole loops is responsible for the string tension and 3 )  to study the behaviors of another non - perturbative quantity , i.e. , the spacial string tension both in the confinement and the deconfinement phases .",
    "we adopt the usual @xmath0 wilson action . the maximally abelian gauge is given @xcite by performing a local gauge transformation @xmath8 such that    @xmath9 is maximized . here",
    "@xmath10 after the gauge fixing is over , there still remains a @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "we can extract an abelian gauge variable from the @xmath0 one as follows ; @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a diagonal abelian gauge field and @xmath13 has off - diagonal components corresponding to charged matters .",
    "it is to be noted that @xcite .",
    "after an abelian projection in ma gauge , it has been shown that an abelian wilson loop operator written in terms of @xmath12 alone reproduce the full string tension in ( @xmath14 ) @xmath0 qcd @xcite .",
    "hence we study here the abelian wilson loops to derive the string tension in finite - temperature @xmath0 qcd .",
    "an abelian wilson loop operator is given by a product of monopole and photon contributions@xcite .",
    "here we take into account only a simple wilson loop of size @xmath15 .",
    "then such an abelian wilson loop operator is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an external current taking @xmath18 along the wilson loop and @xmath19 is an angle variable defined from @xmath12 as follows : @xmath20 since @xmath17 is conserved , it is rewritten for such a simple wilson loop in terms of an antisymmetric variable @xmath21 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a backward derivative on a lattice .",
    "@xmath21 takes @xmath18 on a surface with the wilson loop boundary .",
    "we get @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a forward derivative on a lattice . using the decomposition of @xmath27 into a quantum fluctuation and the dirac string term , we get @xcite @xmath28 where a monopole current @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 following degrand - toussaint@xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is the lattice coulomb propagator . since @xmath32 corresponds to the photon field , @xmath33 is the photon ( the monopole ) contribution to the abelian wilson loop . to study the features of both contributions , we evaluate the expectation values @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath35 separately and compare them with those of @xmath36 .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations were performed on @xmath37 lattice from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "all measurements were done every 50 sweeps after a thermalization of 2000 sweeps .",
    "we took 50 configurations totally for measurements .",
    "the gauge - fixing criterion is the same as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . using gauge - fixed configurations , we derived monopole currents and obtained the ensemble of monopole currents .",
    "we evaluate the averages of @xmath40 using abelian link variables ( called abelian ) on the original lattice , of @xmath41 ( photon part ) , and @xmath42 ( monopole part ) on the lattice , separately .    assuming the static potential is given by linear + coulomb + constant terms",
    ", we try to determine the potential using the least square fit .",
    "there are various ways , but we adopt a method similar to that@xcite using the creutz ratios .",
    "first we have checked two points , i.e. , 1 ) if abelian wilson loop can reproduce the full string tension of @xmath0 qcd also in finite - temperature @xmath0 qcd and 2 ) if the photon contribution @xmath43 and the monopole contribution @xmath44 are uncorrelated , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "our data of the string tensions from abelian wilson loops are plotted in fig .",
    "we calculated the physical string tension and the spacial string tension .",
    "the spacial string tension is calculated by wilson loops composed of only spacial link variables . in the deep confinement region ,",
    "both string tensions show the same unique value as that in ( @xmath14 ) @xmath0 qcd , which is also the same as the full string tension@xcite .",
    "moreover , the physical string tension vanishes at the critical coupling @xmath46 .",
    "however , the spacial string tension does not vanish and remains finite even in the deconfinement phase .    to investigate the correlation of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we have calculated the following quantity @xmath47 they are less than several percent for each size of wilson loops at each @xmath48 .",
    "hence the correlation is negligible in the ma gauge .    the results of the monopole and the photon contributions to the string tension",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ mst ]  ( monopole ) and fig .",
    "[ pst ]  ( photon ) .",
    "the monopole contributions to wilson loops are obtained with relatively small errors .",
    "the creutz ratios of the monopole contributions having small errors are almost independent of the loop size .",
    "this means that the monopole contributions are composed only of an area , a perimeter and a constant terms without a coulomb term .",
    "we find both physical and spacial string tensions from the monopoles almost agree with those from the abelian wilson loops in the confinement phase . in the deconfinement phase ,",
    "the monopole contributions to the physical string tension vanish , whereas those to the spacial one remain non - vanishing .",
    "this is consistent with the data of the asymmetry of the monopole currents running in the timelike and the spacelike directions in the deconfinement region@xcite .",
    "the string tension in the photon part is negligibly small .",
    "but the photon spacial string tension seems to become finite as @xmath48 becomes larger .",
    "this may be due to that the linear + coulomb fit to the spacial wilson loops is not appropriate in the deconfinement phase .",
    "the features of the abelian monopole currents were studied in @xcite through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "they obtained the followings@xcite : 1 ) in the confinement phase , about half of the monopole currents are connected into one long loop although the link number occupied by monopole currents is less than 5 percent of the total link number . , some vacuum configurations have two ( or three ) long loops , the sum of whose lengths is about the same as that of one long - loop case . ]",
    "namely only one long monopole loop exists in one vacuum configuration in the confinement phase .",
    "all the other monopole loops are short .",
    "2 ) in the deconfinement phase , long monopole loops disappear .",
    "all monopole loops are short .",
    "these data are shown in table 1 .",
    "these results bring us an idea that the long monopole current plays an important role in the string tension , because the physical string tension exists only in the confinement phase and vanishes in the deconfinement phase .",
    "we have investigated the contributions from the longest monopole loops and from all other monopole loops to the string tension separately .",
    "the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ lloop ] . clearly , the contributions from the long loop alone reproduce almost the full value of the string tension . on the other hand ,",
    "the short loop contributions are almost zero .",
    "the small finite value of the short loop contribution near @xmath1 can be understood as the contribution from the next longest loop appearing in some vacuum configurations near @xmath1 .",
    "as shown in table 1 , only a few percent of the total links are occupied by monopole currents belonging to the long loop .",
    "nevertheless , it gives rise to the full value of the string tension which is a key quantity of confinement .",
    "this suggests there are monopoles of the two types , one of which is long and is responsible for the string tension and the others are short and have no contributions to the string tension .",
    "the latter may correspond to a lattice artifact which exists also in compact qed .",
    "the importance of long loops is consistent with the role played by extended monopoles in the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "as shown above , the spacial string tension remains non - vanishing in contrast with the physical one .",
    "it is shown that , at high temperature , four dimensional qcd can be regarded through dimensional reduction as an effective three dimensional qcd with @xmath50 as a higgs field@xcite .",
    "the effective gauge coupling constant @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 in terms of the temperature and the four dimensional coupling @xmath53 .",
    "if the temperature dependence of the pure gauge term of the effective theory dominates the string tension , the spacial string tension corresponding to that in the effective three dimensional theory is expected to obey @xmath54 where the temperature dependent running coupling constant is determined at high temperature by the @xmath48 function . up to the two loops",
    ", it is given by @xmath55 the scaling behavior of the spacial string tension ( [ sigmas ] ) derived from the usual full wilson loops is confirmed recently in monte - carlo simulations of @xmath0 qcd@xcite .",
    "let us here study the behavior of the spacial string tension derived from the abelian wilson loops .",
    "since the relation between the lattice spacing @xmath56 and the coupling @xmath48 is not known sufficiently well , we have performed additional monte - carlo simulations varying @xmath57 on @xmath58 lattices to get information at different temperatures following bali et al.@xcite .",
    "we have measured the string tension for @xmath59 at @xmath60 which are the critical points for @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ asst ] and fig .",
    "[ msst ] . in the case of string tension derived from abelian wilson loops ,",
    "we get almost the same behaviors as those of the normal ones denoted by cross points .",
    "the latter is cited from ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath62 is independent of @xmath48 and so the spacial string tension is expected to be a physical quantity remaining in the continuum limit .",
    "to study the scaling behavior ( [ sigmas ] ) in more details , we show in fig .",
    "[ agsc ] and fig .",
    "[ mgsc ] the data @xmath63 versus @xmath64 .",
    "both data seem to satisfy the scaling behavior .",
    "we get @xmath65 and @xmath66 which is almost equal to @xmath67 and @xmath68 obtained in @xcite .",
    "when we consider the spacial string tension derived from monopole wilson loops , we find the value is a little bit lower : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we have not yet known if the discrepancy between the abelian and the monopole spacial string tensions is real or due to systematic errors coming from the fitting .",
    "actually it is not certain whether the linear + coulomb fit to the spacial wilson loops adopted here is correct or not .",
    "hence we have not a definite conclusion whether monopoles alone can reproduce also the spacial string tension at high temperature or not .",
    "further studies are needed to clarify the point .",
