    "<S> in this article , we propose optimal discretization of analog filters ( or controllers ) based on the theory of sampled - data @xmath0 control . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the discretization problem as minimization of the @xmath0 norm of the error system between a ( delayed ) target analog filter and a digital system including an ideal sampler , a zero - order hold , and a digital filter . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is reduced to discrete - time @xmath0 optimization via the fast sample / hold approximation method . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend the proposed method to multirate systems . </S>",
    "<S> feedback controller discretization by the proposed method is discussed with respect to stability . </S>",
    "<S> numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method . </S>"
