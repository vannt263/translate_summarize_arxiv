    "string theory predicts the existence of various solitonic objects , so - called d - branes @xcite .",
    "if the d - branes contain enough energy , then they will form black objects called black - branes with a planar horizon and a singularity @xcite . if one regards the string theory as a good candidate of the theory of everything , then the detailed study of black objects are very worthwhile .",
    "moreover , there have been many recent works paying attention to the black - brane geometry for understanding strongly interacting systems . in the context of ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite , black - branes describe a bulk geometry dual to a quantum field theory of the dense medium",
    ". this will give fruitful results for application of conformal field theory , nuclear physics , condensed matter physics , and so on .",
    "however , up to now , there have been limitations on the study the black objects , since many people relied on analytic techniques .",
    "hence , what people usually have done has been to find static solutions study perturbations of it .",
    "of course , the perturbation method is powerful but not exact and for higher accuracy and deeper understanding of dynamical aspects of black - brane formation and evolution , a numerical approach is required .",
    "there are a lot of papers which study the dynamical formation of black holes and black - branes in order to understand its own gravitational features as well as the time evolution of the non - thermal state , following the spirit of the ads / cft correspondence .    in this paper",
    ", we study dynamical formation , evolution and response of scalar perturbations of black - branes , by using full numerical simulations employing double - null formalism @xcite .",
    "to do so , we consider an einstein - maxwell - scalar model in which the scalar field is complex and has an u(1 ) charge . a similar model , in which the mass square of a complex scalar given by @xmath0 , was taken into account studying the holographic superconductivity where only the static black - brane solution was considered @xcite . related to the stability of such a model",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate the time evolution of solutions which may give rise to some information for the stabilization of the black - brane corresponding to the thermalization of its dual theory .",
    "from this point on , we concentrate on the massless complex scalar case in which the complex scalar field describes the scalar operator with an u(1 ) global charge and conformal dimension @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the bulk gauge field is dual to the matter density operator @xcite .",
    "the thermalization of this system , even in the strong coupling regime , can be represented by the stabilization of the black - brane because the black - brane leads to a well - defined thermal system @xcite .",
    "due to the different topology of black - branes from black holes , the collision of planar / hyperbolic energy pulses in the asymptotically flat space time does not form black objects @xcite . however , this is not the case in the asymptotic anti de sitter background .",
    "since there already exist well - known black - brane solutions , the dynamical formation of such a black object should be allowed .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to apply the double - null formalism to black - brane formation in spacetimes with nontrivial asymptotic geometry . in this paper ,",
    "we especially focus on the inside and outside of black - branes . for the inside",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of singularities , cauchy horizon and the cosmic censorship issue @xcite . for the outside , we perturb the scalar field and observe the effects of it",

    ", we will take into account the @xmath11 case and investigate the dynamical formation , evolution and stabilization of a black - brane which , following the ads / cft correspondence , describes a thermalization process of the dual theory .",
    "we can derive einstein equations and scalar field equations : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14    in this paper , we assume the double - null metric ansatz @xcite : @xmath15 where we can impose symmetries as follows @xcite :    1 .",

    "thus , we can show that @xmath38 therefore , we can identify the local mass function as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a negative constant ( see subsequent sections ) . with this in mind , we need to specify initial conditions for all functions ( @xmath41 ) , on the initial @xmath42 and @xmath43 surfaces .    at the starting point of our computational domain ( @xmath44 ) ,",
    "we choose @xmath45 so that the line element at this point becomes trivial ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ds ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , at this initial point , we may choose @xmath46 as well as an initial mass of @xmath47 .",
    "in principle we are free to choose an arbitrary intial gauge and hence we may chose a linear gauge with @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 on the initial null surfaces .",

    "to    determine @xmath55 along this surface , we can now    integrate equation  ( [ eq : e1 ] ) to obtain @xmath56 .",
    "we    may now in principle integrate equation  ( [ eq : m3 ] ) to obtain    @xmath30 along the ingoing surface , however , since we choose    the scalar field to be trivial along this surface , as a consequence ,    @xmath57 becomes equally trivial ( also so for    @xmath58 ) .",
    "this provides us with values for all variables    along the initial ingoing null surface .",
    "out - going ( @xmath42 ) null surface : : :    on the outgoing null surface , we choose @xmath59    for @xmath60 , and otherwise ,    @xmath61 , @xmath62 is some amplitude .",

    "similarly , we may integrate equations  ( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) , to    determine values for @xmath64 and @xmath30 along the    initial outgoing null surface .",
    "this finishes the assignments of the    initial conditions .",
    "these initial conditions correspond to a situation where the initial background geometry is a pure anti de sitter space with an initial charged scalar pulse , which propagates to the center .",
    "the nontrivial charge and energy density of the initial pulse can disturb the initial geometry and deform it to another solution . here",
    ", by using numerical simulations , we will investigate the dynamical evolution of the anti de sitter space to a charged black - brane and the stabilization of it , which can be reinterpreted as a thermalization of the dual matter theory according to the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "in this section , we study the inside of black - branes during dynamical gravitational collapses .",

    "we vary the gauge coupling @xmath9 and the vacuum energy @xmath68 and compare the results .",
    "the left side of figure  [ fig : causal ] is the typical causal structure of a charged black - brane . here , we used @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "after the gravitational collapse , the apparent horizon @xmath71 grows in a space - like manner and quickly approaches an asymptote along the out - going null direction .",
    "deep inside the black - brane , we can see a space - like @xmath72 singularity .",
    "inside of the ( apparent ) horizon , as @xmath73 increases , one can see the fall - off of @xmath74 with @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig : g ] ) .",
    "this shows that in the @xmath76 limit , both @xmath77 and @xmath78 approaches a non - zero finite value .",
    "therefore , this becomes an inner null horizon , that is the same as a spherical charged black hole .",
    "this causal structure can be summarized in the right diagram of figure  [ fig : causal ] .",
    "this is quite consistent with black hole cases @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : causal ] , the black - brane is stabilized after the time @xmath79 , at which the value of @xmath78 indicates the event horizon . since @xmath80 and @xmath81 along the curve after this critical point , one can easily see from equations  ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) that there is no variation in the radial coordinate .",
    "this fact implies that the increase of @xmath73 along the curve is nothing but the time evolution of the fixed event horizon . as a result",
    ", an initial charged scalar pulse deforms the initial anti de sitter space to the black - brane geometry , which is stabilized after a finite time interval using equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) and it is approximately @xmath82 . ] .",
    "the resulting black - brane is charged due to the nontrivial distribution of the charge function ( see figure  [ fig : l0001_q ] ) . if applying the ads / cft correspondence , the stabilization of the black - brane represents the thermalization of the @xmath83-dimensional dual field theory with matter , where the bulk gauge field is dual to the density operator while the charged scalar field in the asymptotic anti de sitter space describes the condensate of the scalar operator with a global u(1 ) charge and a conformal dimension of @xmath1 .",

    "however , as @xmath9 increase , the asymptotic charge increase and the spatial distribution of charge changes .",
    "after sufficient time has passed ( large @xmath73 ) , the charge distribution approaches a stationary limit .",
    "however , before that happens , one can see interesting behavior .",
    "upper part of figure  [ fig : discharging ] shows a region in the vicinity of the horizon for a large gauge coupling limit ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the charge function at the horizon is initially positive but due to the field dynamics its sign changes , and eventually approaches a stationary value .",
    "if @xmath9 increases further , such charge oscillations become dominant .",
    "we can interpret this as follows ( lower part of figure  [ fig : discharging ] ) ; first , the gravitational collapse happens ( first figure ) .",
    "however , during the gravitational collapse , via large @xmath9 and large charge repulsion , locally some inside region becomes uncharged or even oppositely charged ( second figure ) .",
    "such an oppositely charged region can appear outside of the horizon .",

    "if the charge increase more than the extreme limit , then the solution will be a naked singularity and will violate the weak cosmic censorship .",
    "@xmath93 as function of by @xmath9 and @xmath68 . here , @xmath92 and @xmath94 are observed on the horizon for sufficiently large @xmath73 . ]",
    "let us find the condition for the extreme limit .",
    "the horizon @xmath95 for the extreme limit should satisfy two conditions : @xmath96 and @xmath97 . or , equivalently , @xmath98 then , the horizon @xmath95 in the extreme limit is @xmath99 and at the same time , the condition @xmath100 should be satisfied . therefore , to satisfy weak cosmic censorship , we require @xmath101    we wish to check whether such kind of weak cosmic censorship is satisfied in a _ dynamical way _ during gravitational collapse or not . in figure",
    "[ fig : q_m_e ] , we vary @xmath68 and @xmath9 and checked the ratio @xmath102 on the outer apparent horizon after the charge distribution approaches the stationary state .",
    "interestingly , if @xmath9 is too small or too large , then the ratio is quite small and hence it looks neutral . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath9 is too large , then the repulsion dominates and hence it repulses almost all charges ; this causes the large coupling limit to be neutral .",
    "in addition , we observe that as @xmath103 increases , the standard deviation and peak of @xmath102 increase .",
    "the most important thing is that @xmath102 always stay below a value of one , which confirms our expectation that the process of gravitational collapse , dynamically conserves the weak cosmic censorship of black - branes .",

    "we can re - write the metric in the following form : @xmath105 without loss of generality , one can ignore the symmetric part @xmath106 for the following calculations .    for in - falling matter along the in - going null direction ( for coordinates @xmath107 $ ] ) , the energy - momentum tensor components @xmath108 can be represented by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an arbitrary function that refers to the luminosity function @xcite . if there is an observer who moves along the out - going null direction and approaches the cauchy horizon @xmath111 , then for a null geodesic of the observer @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 near the @xmath76 limit , where @xmath115 is an affine parameter of the observer and @xmath116 is the surface gravity of the inner horizon . in conclusion , the out - going observer who approaches the cauchy horizon measures the energy density for the energy flow that flows along the cauchy horizon by @xcite : @xmath117 for four dimensions and spherical symmetry , for a realistic black hole the behavior of the luminosity function should be polynomial to @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that any small energy flow along the cauchy horizon is amplified for an observer who approaches to the cauchy horizon .",
    "this effect is known as _",
    "mass inflation_.    the previous description should be correct for general topologies , but the physical meaning is not entirely clear .",
    "for example , we do not have a general description of the luminosity function for the planar symmetry and hyperbolic symmetry in the anti de sitter background .",
    "also , if the topology is not spherical symmetry , then @xmath78 no longer represents the areal radius .",
    "however , it is fair to say that the assumptions of mass inflation for black hole cases are still reasonable .",
    "therefore , it seems that mass inflation should be observed even for black - brane cases .",
    "if it is true , then the inner horizon can not be stable and there should be strong back - reactions due to high energy density @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to use numerical techniques to study these structures .    if one observer can penetrate beyond the null cauchy horizon ( of figure  [ fig : causal ] ) , then the observer may violate the strong cosmic censorship , unless the inner horizon becomes a curvature singularity .",
    "we observed the mass function along some out - going and in - going null surfaces ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "schematic diagram of mass inflation for anti de sitter black - branes and black holes . for the black hole case , mass inflation",
    "is observed around the green - colored region and hence the cauchy horizon is covered @xcite . for the black - brane case , the only black - colored region",
    "is protected by mass inflation . ]",
    "the result is interesting ; along the out - going null direction , the mass function is quite stable .",
    "however , along the in - going null direction , the mass function becomes unstable once the coordinate @xmath119 increases beyond a critical limit .",
    "the critical @xmath119 corresponds to @xmath120 , where this is the approximate inner horizon radius of the static solution , equation  ( [ eq : staticsol ] ) .",
    "unless one observer approaches such a critical radius , the mass function is sufficiently small and no one can see mass inflation .    such a behavior ( when @xmath121 , the mass begins to inflate ) is consistent with the usual mass inflation @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that charged black - branes also have mass inflation as in black holes . however , there are quite distinct difference from the mass inflation of black holes ( figure  [ fig : minf ] ) . for the black hole case",
    ", the appearance of exponential mass increase appears relatively sooner than for the black - brane cases . for black holes ,",
    "once an observer falls beyond the event horizon , mass inflation is practically unavoidable for out - going observers .",
    "however , for black - brane cases , an observer inside of the event horizon can move along the out - going null direction and the observer can be safe without experiencing mass inflation .",
    "therefore , for black - branes , it is highly non - trivial whether strong cosmic censorship will be satisfied or mass inflation will create a curvature singularity along the inner cauchy horizon .",
    "we first see the scalar field dynamics around the apparent horizon .",
    "figure  [ fig : hair2 ] shows that as the gauge coupling increases , the scalar field decays more slowly and it seems to converge to a certain _ non - trivial value_. perhaps , this can present a dynamical formation of a scalar hair around the black - brane .",
    "second , to perturb this scalar field , we slightly modify the initial scalar field after @xmath122 as follows : @xmath123 this expression is designed to add a power - law tail to the primary scalar field pulse @xmath124 ( see equation  ( [ eq : s_pulse ] ) ) , after the main pulse .",
    "the constant @xmath125 marks the beginning of the added tail ( for @xmath126 , we set @xmath127 ) and @xmath128 marks the beginning of the power - law decay , we usually set @xmath125 to coincide with the beginning of the main pulse and set @xmath128 to be inside the main pulse .",
    "this ensures that after the main pulse , we obtain a nice tail which decays as a power - law of order @xmath129 .",
    "the expression is scaled so that the amplitude @xmath130 corresponds to the maximum of the added tail .",
    "we regard this as a scalar field perturbation from the boundary of the anti de sitter to the black - brane .",
    "we hope to see the response of the scalar perturbation after an interaction with the black - brane . as long as @xmath130 is sufficiently small",
    ", it will not modify the general causal structure .",

    "the typical behavior is that after a black - brane is formed , a part of the previous scalar field remnant is again absorbed into the black - brane , hence the black - brane slightly grows and then the horizon stabilizes after some oscillation . here",
    ", the oscillation for the scalar field amplitude can be understood as the competition of the attractive gravitational and repulsive electric forces .",

    "one interesting result is that there _ remains _ a non - trivial scalar field outside the event horizon ( figure  [ fig : hair2 ] ) . as in figure",
    "[ fig : interpretation ] , this means that there is a non - trivial response to the out - going direction . what will happen for this response ? will it eventually collapse to the black - brane and disappear , or remain outside and approaches a stationary combination ?",
    "it is not entirely clear for our simulations , since we could not observe the scattering of the scalar field from the boundary .",
    "however , we can interpret this way .",
    "initially , we gave an _ over - charged _ initial condition .",
    "due to weak cosmic censorship , some of charge should be scattered .",
    "then there will be an out - going scattered charge configuration .",
    "if the background is asymptotically de sitter or minkowski , then the scattered responses will disappear eventually and there will be no non - trivial scalar fields . on the other hand ,",
    "if the background is anti de sitter , then the response can not escape to infinity .",
    "hence , there should remain a _",
    "charge cloud _ between the event horizon and the boundary .",
    "this non - trivial scalar field configuration will remain forever , although we could not determine whether it approaches a stationary state or oscillates between the horizon and the boundary forever .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the dynamics of inside and outside of a black - brane in anti de sitter space , by numerical simulations using double - null formalism . in terms of numerical studies , it was interesting that a charged matter shell can form a black object without collision .",
    "this is due to the effect of anti de sitter space .",
    "we focused our attention to the inside and outside of black - branes .",
    "for the inside , we observed the causal structure : a space - like apparent horizon , a space - like singularity @xmath72 and a null - like cauchy horizon . even though we tune the gauge coupling parameter , the solution does not become a overcharged solution .",
    "therefore , automatically the weak cosmic censorship is safe . on the other hand",
    ", the strong cosmic censorship seems not to be safe .",
    "the cauchy horizon becomes singular due to the mass inflation , but the effect is much milder compared to the case of charged black hole .",
    "there may exist an observer inside the apparent horizon who is moving in the outgoing direction and that observer may not see the serious effects of mass inflation and can reach the cauchy horizon .",
    "this is a quite different phenomena compared to the black hole case .    for the outside",
    ", we observed the dynamics of scalar perturbations . by adding an artificial scalar hair",
    ", the scalar field around the horizon is perturbed .",
    "for some over - charged examples , there remains a non - trivial scalar responses outside the horizon and there are observable imprints along the out - going direction .",
    "this can be interpreted as a non - trivial black hole solution with a charge cloud and this can have some meaning in the boundary conformal field theory .    to our knowledge ,",
    "new observations in this paper are :    * we observed the _",
    "dynamical _ formation of black - branes .",
    "* we concisely investigated cosmic censorship of dynamical black - branes .",
    "* we see dynamics of scalar fields outside the black - brane with full back - reactions .",
    "we may extend this analysis to other symmetries ( topological black holes ) , other dimensions , or other theories ( different couplings or potentials ) .",
    "in this appendix , we demonstrate that our numerical code is converging ( to a physical solution ) when including the effects of nontrivial scalar field , @xmath40 and charge .",
    "the results presented here are very similar to those presented in @xcite as could be expected , since the codes in those papers and this one are essentially identical .",
    "for this reason we refer to those papers and references therein , for further details of the inner workings of the code .",
    "the initial conditions and computational domain for the tests in this appendix are similar to those used for making figure  [ fig : causal ] , i.e. the scalar pulse is between @xmath135 , @xmath136 and charge @xmath137 .",
    "this scenario is non - trivial and thus a good test for the general convergence properties of our code .",
    "our computational domain for this convergence tests is , as for figure  [ fig : causal ] , in the range @xmath138 $ ] and @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "this setup is one of the most complicated one that we have done in this paper in that it leaves no trivial terms left in the evolution equations and it is thus a good test for the convergence of our code .",
    "here we demonstrate the convergence of the code by comparing a series of simulations with varying numerical resolution .",
    "for the tests in this appendix , we do a total of 6 simulations , with each simulation changing the base resolution .    to limit the number of plots , we concentrate on displaying convergence results along the line @xmath140 , which ( as can be seen by figure  [ fig : causal ] ) is well inside the apparent horizon and quite close to the @xmath72 singularity .",
    "thus , if we see convergence here , it is a fair indication that convergence requirements are satisfied throughout the whole of the computational domain .    along this line ( @xmath140 ) , we calculate the relative convergence between two simulations ( one with a numerical resolution twice that of the other ) relative to a simulation with very high resolution : @xmath141 where @xmath142 denotes the dynamic variable @xmath143 at the @xmath144-th grid point of simulation with resolution @xmath145 and where @xmath146 denotes the dynamic variable of the same @xmath144th point for a simulation with the highest numerical resolution done by us .",
    "obviously , this expression only makes sense for those @xmath144 points that coincide in all simulations .",
    "the first four plots in figure [ fig : convergence ] show the relative convergence , @xmath147 , for the dynamic variables @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively .",
    "the lines in the figures are marked by their numerical resolution measured in terms of the most coarse resolution @xmath150 , the high resolution simulation used to calculate expression equation  ( [ eq : xidef ] ) , has a numerical resolution of @xmath151 times the base resolution , i.e. @xmath152 .    from these figures , it is clearly seen that the four dynamic variables are converging for simulations of increasing resolution .",
    "furthermore , since we plot the _ relative _ convergence of the dynamic variables , we see that the relative change between the two highest resolution simulations show that the variables change @xmath153 or less , which must be considered a quite acceptable convergence .",
    "we note that a closer analysis of the data in figures [ fig : convergence ] has revealed that the dynamic variables are indeed converging with second order accuracy as was expected based on analyses and tests performed in previous works @xcite .",
    "however , it is , of course , not enough to demonstrate that the simulations are converging , they must also converge to a physical solution , i.e. the residuals of the constraint equations must converge to zero . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we calculate the relative convergence of the constraint equation residuals , ( relative to the einstein - tensor ) in a similar way to equation  ( [ eq : xidef ] ) : @xmath154 where @xmath155 denotes the residual of the constraint equation , ( @xmath156 or @xmath157 ) , at the @xmath144th point for simulation with resolution @xmath145 and where @xmath158 denotes the corresponding einstein - tensor component ( @xmath159 or @xmath160 respectively ) at the same point .",
    "the relative convergence of the residuals of the constraint equations are demonstrated in the bottom two plots of figure  [ fig : convergence ] , where it is seen that they converge towards zero for higher resolution simulations .",
    "this indicates that not only are the numerical solutions converging for simulations of higher resolution , but that they are indeed converging towards a physical solution .",
    "finally it should be noted that the convergence results presented in this appendix are not the only convergence tests that we have performed , they merely represent typical results of the convergence behavior of the code .",
    "for all results presented in this paper , we have performed a large number of simulations with varying resolutions to ensure that the results had converged to their physical solution .",
