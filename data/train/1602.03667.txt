    "oscillations in red giants are driven by turbulent motions in the outermost layers of their convective envelopes ( for a review , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chaplin & miglio 2013 ) ) , this being the same mechanism responsible for the oscillations observed in the sun and other solar - type stars .",
    "but unlike main - sequence stars , red giants have an interior characterized by a high density contrast between core and envelope .",
    "this density contrast leads to mixed modes of oscillation that behave as gravity modes in the core and as acoustic modes in the envelope . over the 4-year nominal mission , _ kepler _ ( ( *",
    "* borucki et al .",
    "2010 ) ) detected oscillations in more than ten thousand red giants up to distances of @xmath0 , a fraction of which reside in open clusters .",
    "this is the case of ngc  6791 , which at roughly 8 billion years old ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brogaard et al .  2012 ) ) should be populated by a large number of degenerate stars and hence possible sources of gws .",
    "the development of high - precision asteroseismology has opened the possibility of using pulsating stars in the search for gws ( ( * ? ? ? * lopes & silk 2015 ) ) . just like with experimental spherical detectors ,",
    "the impact of a gw will produce a change in the star s size . as a consequence ,",
    "one or more modes of oscillation may be affected , resulting in tiny variations of their surface velocity amplitudes . by monitoring such variations",
    "it is in principle possible to measure the imprint of a gw on the stellar frequency - power spectrum .",
    "current models predict that , for the sun , the surface velocity amplitudes will vary from @xmath1 to @xmath2 for gws with local strains of @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lopes & silk 2014 ) ) , still below current detectability thresholds .",
    "we propose using red - giant stars in stellar clusters to search for gws .",
    "when such stars are located near gw sources ( e.g. , an ultra - compact binary a few au away ) , quadrupole mixed modes may be stimulated above the threshold of detectability .",
    "mode excitation by an external source depends on the internal structure of the star , and in particular on how modes are damped .",
    "mixed modes are characterized by smaller damping rates than those of purely acoustic modes observed in solar - type stars .",
    "moreover , the mean separation between red giants in clusters is small ( a few ly ) .",
    "this can be used to look for the same gw imprint on quadrupole modes of different stars .",
    "the time lag between the excitation of quadrupole modes of two different stars could be approximately determined from their plane - of - the - sky projected locations and the fact that gws propagate at the speed of light .",
    "finally , these stars can probe the @xmath1@xmath5 spectral window ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : strain ] ) , which can not be fully probed by conventional gw detectors such as the square kilometre array ( ska ) or the evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( _ elisa _ ) ."
