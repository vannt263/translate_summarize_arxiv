    "<S> recently , a set of experiments has been carried out on bacterial evolution which has given rise to a new sub - discipline in the area of evolutionary biology , namely , experimental evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the study , in the laboratory , of the fundamental processes of evolutionary change , namely , spontaneous mutation and adaptation by natural selection . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on evolutionary dynamics require passage through thousands of generations which is an impossibility for most living species . </S>",
    "<S> microorganisms like bacteria , yeast or viruses , however , have very short generation times ( bacteria like e.coli have about seven generations everyday in sugar solution ) . </S>",
    "<S> the short generation times make it possible to observe population dynamics over thousands of generations and thereby address a wide range of evolutionary questions . </S>",
    "<S> darwin laid the foundation of evolutionary biology by setting forth the principle of adaptation by species through natural selection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is now known that spontaneous mutation plays an important role in generating differences among individual organisms . </S>",
    "<S> a mutation involves a change in the base sequence of a dna and can occur with a certain probability during cell division . </S>",
    "<S> mutations are random events and may be harmful , neutral or beneficial as regards their effect on an organism . according to the modern version of darwin s theory , </S>",
    "<S> random mutations give rise to heritable differences among organisms whereas natural selection tends to increase the number of fitter variants . </S>",
    "<S> the processes of reproduction , mutation and natural selection are responsible for evolution of species or that of a single population .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a set of experiments carried out by lenski and co - workers @xcite on the bacteria e.coli . </S>",
    "<S> as pointed out by them @xcite , a large population size of e.coli ensures that a large number of mutations occur in every generation so that the origin and the fate of genetic variation can be well studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to store bacteria in suspended animation at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> one can then measure the relative fitness ( rf ) of descendant and ancestral populations by placing them in direct competition . </S>",
    "<S> the rf is expressed as the ratio of the realized growth rates of the two populations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the populations are easy to handle and propagate so that intensive replication of experiments is possible allowing subtle effects to be measured . in the first experiment @xcite , lenski and co - workers studied an evolving bacterial population for approximately 10,000 generations . </S>",
    "<S> the bacterial population was allowed to expand to @xmath2 cells in low sugar solution . at the end of the growth period ( one day ) , @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> th of the population was siphoned into a fresh flask of food to allow the population to evolve . since there was a 100-fold expansion of the bacterial population in a day , @xmath4 generations of binary fussion occurred during this time . </S>",
    "<S> every fifteen days , a sample of the population was frozen for later analysis giving rise to a ` frozen fossil record ' . </S>",
    "<S> since the population originated from a single cell , mutations , about @xmath5 everyday , provided the sole source of genetic variation . </S>",
    "<S> four years later , lenski et al had data for the evolving bacterial population over 10,000 generations . </S>",
    "<S> they measured two quantities , the average cell size which is preserved in fossil records , and the rf . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the average cell size and the rf grow in a punctuated manner , i.e. , in steps , as a function of time ( number of generations ) when the data are plotted every 100 generations ( inset of fig.1 ) . at a larger interval of 500 generations , </S>",
    "<S> the changes appear to be gradual ( inset of fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a major debate in evolutionary biology revolves around the question of whether evolution is best described as a gradual change or occurs in bursts . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> short periods of evolutionary activity are punctuated by long periods of stasis . </S>",
    "<S> this is the theory of punctuated equilibrium ( pe ) . </S>",
    "<S> lenski et al s data seem to support this theory though their interpretation is open to controversy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment , however , clearly demonstrates that both the average cell size and the rf of the evolving population grow over a certain time interval . in the first 2000 generations or so </S>",
    "<S> , there is a rapid growth followed by a period of slower growth till the growth is imperceptible . the bacteria , being in low sugar solution , have to compete for the food . </S>",
    "<S> natural selection favours the mutations that confer some competitive advantage in exploiting the experimental environment . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to adaptation of the bacterial population to the environment through the emergence of larger and fitter varients .    in the second experiment @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , twelve populations of e.coli were evolved over 10,000 generations in identical environments . </S>",
    "<S> each population was founded by a single cell from an asexual clone to eliminate genetic variation within and between populations . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the replicate populations , after 10,000 generations , differ considerably from one another in both the average cell size and the rf ( inset of fig.3 ) , even though the populations evolved in identical environments . in the third experiment @xcite , the relative contributions of adaptation , chance ( mutations ) and history to evolution were investigated . </S>",
    "<S> twelve replicate populations were founded from a single clone of e.coli and serially propagated for 2000 generations in glucose - limited medium . </S>",
    "<S> the 12 populations had similar fitness values when evolving in glucose medium but when put in a maltose - limited medium showed large differences in fitness values . </S>",
    "<S> some populations thrived while some others were found to languish . </S>",
    "<S> ancestral fitness values of the populations in maltose were thus very heterogeneous ( inset of fig.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one genotype from each of the 12 replicate populations was cloned and from this 3 new replicate populations were founded . </S>",
    "<S> the 36 populations were then evolved under ancestral conditions in the maltose medium . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig.4 shows the derived fitness in maltose the versus ancestrial fitness in maltose for 36 populations .    </S>",
    "<S> bak and sneppen ( bs ) @xcite have proposed a model to study the evolution of interacting species . </S>",
    "<S> the model self - organises into a critical state characterised by power - laws of various types . </S>",
    "<S> further , evolutionary activity in this state exhibits pe . </S>",
    "<S> boettcher and paczuski @xcite have proposed the m - trait bs model in which each biological species is characterised by m traits , instead of one trait ( fitness ) as in the original bs model . </S>",
    "<S> the major focus of these studies has been the self - organised critical ( soc ) state and its various features . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution leading to the soc state has not been studied in detail . in this letter , we show that , with some simple modifications of the m=2 bs model , many of the experimental results of lenski et al can be reproduced in a qualitative manner . </S>",
    "<S> our study highlights the significance of the dynamics in the bs - type models before the soc state is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the bs model gives a coarse - grained representation of real evolution but contains the essential elements to capture the course of evolution . in our modified m=2 bs model , </S>",
    "<S> the bacterial population is divided into n categories . </S>",
    "<S> each category contains bacteria of similar characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the n categories correspond to the n sites of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice with periodic boundary conditions . in the original bs model , </S>",
    "<S> each site represents a species . </S>",
    "<S> two traits , namely , cell size and fitness are associated with the population at each site i , i=1,2, ... ,n . </S>",
    "<S> one assigns a number ( between 0 and 1 ) to each of the traits at all the n sites . at each time step </S>",
    "<S> , the two sites with the minimum values for each of the two traits are identified . </S>",
    "<S> mutations occur to bring about changes in the traits . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum random numbers are replaced by new random numbers . in the original m=2 bs model , </S>",
    "<S> the minimum value , amongst all the 2n values of the two traits , is replaced by a new random number . </S>",
    "<S> the random numbers associated with any one of the traits of the neighbouring sites are also replaced by new random numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this is to take into account the linkage of neighbouring populations in food chain . </S>",
    "<S> the last two steps are repeated and averages are taken for both the traits locally ( over 40 sites ) and globally ( over 2000 sites ) . unlike in the original bs model , we calculate quantities from the very beginning and not after the soc state is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the soc state corresponds to the region in which evolutionary growth is imperceptible and fluctuates around an average value . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the variation of the rf versus time . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the averages are taken over 40 sites and every 100 time steps . </S>",
    "<S> the local averaging gives rise to an improved quality of data points . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the corresponding variation with averages taken every 500 time steps and over the whole lattice . for a very large lattice one </S>",
    "<S> needs to take only global averages . </S>",
    "<S> the rf is defined to be the ratio of the current fitness and the initial fitness at time t=0 . in the actual experiment </S>",
    "<S> , fitness is related to the growth rate of the bacterial population via replication . </S>",
    "<S> the rf increases rapidly during the first 2000 generations . </S>",
    "<S> after that the growth becomes slower till it becomes imperceptible . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid growths can be fit by an hyperbolic model @xmath6 for both the experimental and simulation data . during the periods of punctuation </S>",
    "<S> the beneficial mutations are few with no significant effect . </S>",
    "<S> when such mutations occur in quick succession , rapid evolutionary growth is observed . </S>",
    "<S> recent research findings @xcite have highlighted the importance of large beneficial mutations in the initial stages of evolutionary growth . </S>",
    "<S> organisms must adapt to the new conditions fairly quickly in order to survive . </S>",
    "<S> later , mutations with smaller effect fine - tune the adaptation . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows this clearly with a rapid evolutionary growth in the first 2000 generations brought about by beneficial mutations of large effect . </S>",
    "<S> the growths are imperceptible when the bacterial population gets adapted to its environment . </S>",
    "<S> the average cell size as a function of time has similar variations as in the case of the rf ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 shows a comparison of the simulation data for the rf with the data ( inset ) of the second experiment of lenski et al @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the plots show that the independent populations diverge significantly from one another . in the simulation , </S>",
    "<S> the initial random number seed was chosen to be different for the six populations . the average fitness at time @xmath7 does not vary noticably from one population to another . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4 shows the simulation results for the third experiment @xcite with @xmath8 populations rather than the @xmath9 populations in the actual experiment . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the populations growing in glucose- limited medium were transferred after 2000 generations to maltose - limited medium . in the latter medium </S>",
    "<S> , the average fitness values of the populations showed large differences . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the simulation for the maltose medium , one starts with widely different average fitness values for the populations . </S>",
    "<S> the populations are evolved for 1000 time steps . </S>",
    "<S> one finds , in agreement with the experimental results , that after 1000 generations , the average fitness values have similar magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that adaptation and chance ( effect of mutation ) have eliminated the initial heterogeneity in average fitness values to a great extent . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of history ( initial heterogeneity ) is reduced after several generations of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of adaptation is pronounced ( shown by the evolution of the data points above the isocline ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of chance is seen in the small dispersion in the average fitness values of the two populations corresponding to each genotype . </S>",
    "<S> lenski et al @xcite have given quantitative estimates of the relative contributions of adaptation , chance and history to average fitness and cell size before and after 1000 generations in maltose .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we have described a set of experiments by lenski et al on bacterial evolution and have shown that a m=2 bs - type model gives a satisfactory description of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> both simulation and experiments support the theory of pe in bacterial evolution . </S>",
    "<S> recent exhaustive studies of fossil beds lend support to this theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied to evolving bacterial populations rather than to interacting species as in the original bs model . </S>",
    "<S> also , as emphasized earlier , the bs - type models have so far been studied in the context of self - organised criticality . in this brief report </S>",
    "<S> , we highlight the significance of the temporal evolution of bs - type models before the self - organised critical state is reached . </S>",
    "<S> this temporal evolution needs to be characterised in greater detail to give a quantitative fit to the experimental data of lenski et al . </S>",
    "<S> for example , appropriate change in random number intervals may be necessary for a good fit . </S>",
    "<S> lenski et al @xcite have developed theories based on standard population - genetics approaches to explain some of their experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the bs - type model gives a coarse - grained description to bacterial evolution but , as shown in this letter , it captures the major features of the evolutionary growth of bacterial populations . </S>",
    "<S> experiments have recently been performed on the growth of rna virus fitness @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the adaptive evolutionary capacity in this case is overwhelming . </S>",
    "<S> the gain in fitness is nearly 5000 after 50 passages . in that time </S>",
    "<S> , the gain in e.coli fitness changes can be explained by an hyperbolic model whereas rna virus evolution follows exponential kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the rna virus evolution follows exponential kinetics whereas e.coli evolution corresponds to hyperbolic growth . </S>",
    "<S> a bs - type model can explain the hyperbolic growth but not the exponential one . for bacterial populations , lenski et al s remarkable experiments open up possibilities of a rich interplay between theory and experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the self - organised critical state in the experiment and simulation corresponds to the region in which growth is imperceptible . with appropriate designing of experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of self - organised criticality in an evolving bacterial population can be studied experimentally . </S>"
