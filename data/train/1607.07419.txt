    "since the discovery of topological insulators ( ti ) protected by time - reversal symmetry  @xcite , the extension of the topological classification to other discrete symmetry classes such as particle - hole and translation symmetries has been investigated .",
    "recently , this classification has been extended to topologically distinct classes of band structures which can not be smoothly deformed into each other without breaking certain crystal point group symmetries  @xcite .",
    "a hallmark of this new class , topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) , is the existence of the surface states on crystal faces which respect the corresponding crystal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy properties of the surface states are determined by the surface orientation .",
    "the dirac structure of the tci is quite distinct from that in the standard ti systems .",
    "the tci supports an even number of metallic dirac states on crystal surfaces , while it is an odd number of the most common ti systems .",
    "there are two types of the surface states  @xcite , which preserve the discrete rotational symmetries and support gapless surface states , in which type i refers to the ( 110 ) surface states and type ii denotes the states of ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "hsieh _ et al _ predicted @xcite that , using first - principles simulations , the iv - vi semiconductor snte as well as related alloys pb@xmath0sn@xmath1te and pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se belong to tcis class protected by mirror symmetry  @xcite which is characterized by robust surface states on the ( 001 ) plane .",
    "the inverted band ordering in snte , in which the valence band is originated from the @xmath2 orbitals of the cation sn and the conduction made by the band from te , relative to a trivial ionic insulator gives rise to the tcis phase in snte  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this prediction has been experimentally confirmed by the direct observation of topological surface states using the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite .",
    "signatures of surface states have also been observed in transport and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the remarkable properties of the tcis is that there emerge four topological protected surface dirac cones . alongside with theoretical studies stemming from first - principles simulations and a low - energy effective dirac theory , it has been verified experimentally @xcite that in the ( 001 ) surface states there are gapless dirac cones at the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points and at the @xmath5 and three @xmath6 points in the ( 111 ) surface  @xcite .",
    "the ( 001 ) surface states contain four dirac cones centered at mirror - symmetric - invariant momenta ( two along @xmath7 and two along @xmath8 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in the surface brillouin zone , while the ( 111 ) surface states consist of dirac cones centered at a time - reversal - invariant momenta , namely ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 points .",
    "the low - energy dirac points in the ( 001 ) surface centered away from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points are protected only by mirror symmetry , _ i.e. _ , the two degenerate states at each dirac point have different mirror eigenvalues , while the high - energy dirac points centered at the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) point are only protected by time - reversal symmetry . as the energy changes away from the low - energy dirac - point , the topology of the surface states band structures undergoes a lifshitz transition at a critical energy where the constant - energy contour changes from two separate charge pockets to two concentric pockets . at this transition point ,",
    "saddle points in the surface band structure lead to a van hove singularity in the density of states .",
    "a hallmark of the thermoelectric material study came actually from the pioneering works in ref .",
    "[ ] proposing that nanostructuring materials should most likely provide high thermoelectric efficiencies than with bulk materials . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no theoretical and experimental works have been carried out on the conductivity and thermoelectric properties of tcis .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies were mainly focused on the band structure calculations and @xmath9 hamiltonian for various types of tcis surface states .",
    "thermoelectric effects have received great attention in recent years owing to their crucial relevance in meso- and nanoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "the study of the thermoelectric is not only technologically helpful in managing the generated heat in nano - devices , but also the analysis of thermoelectric effects are of fundamental interest as it is very useful in elucidating some details of the electronic band structure of tcis surface states that can not be probed by conductance measurements alone due to a particular to the ambipolar nature of this gapless material .    in this paper , we investigate the combination of the charge and heat transport in tci ( 001 ) surface states as a system due to their peculiar features .",
    "we consider the system exposed by a thermal gradient and moreover bias voltages in diffusive regimes considering a short - range potential and long - range charge - charge coulomb potential with a thomas - fermi screening as the source of scattering .",
    "having employed the generalized boltzmann transport equation , we obtain the conductivity , the seebeck coefficient and the figure of merit which is a measure of thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "our findings show that when the fermi energy lies at the transition point , a local minimum of the conductivity emerges and on the other hand , when it lies at the high energy dirac points , the inter - band scattering is suppressed due to the vanishing density of states for one of the subband at that point . as a result , a maximum at a finite doping appears in the conductivity . in addition , the seebeck coefficient changes sign at the low- and high - energy dirac points as well as transition points , owing to the conversion of the charge carriers from electrons to holes and vice versa . taking into account the fact that electronic properties of tci surface states can be easily tuned in contrast to common materials due to the gapless excitation spectrum of tci surface states , these results propose that tcis could be a promising material for the caloritronic applications rather than common metals .",

    "@xcite predicted that @xmath58 can reach to unity at room temperature in phosphorene , a new atomistically thin two - dimensional materials , at low density .",
    "finally , we should like to comment on the possible influences of phonon in our results which we have not considered .",
    "the main effect of phonon is their contribution in the thermal conductivity @xmath152 and the thermopower are not affected with the presence of phonon .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the thermal conductivity of phonon @xmath153 can only affect the figure of merit in our results and since it does not depend on the chemical potential , it might only increase @xmath152 depending on the temperature values .",
    "this should decrease @xmath149 but dependence on the @xmath51 will not be changed qualitatively . at higher temperatures , phonon becomes important but as we mentioned before it only results in the overall decline of the predicted figures of merit , without affecting their qualitative behavior .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the effects of both sr and lr charge - impurity interactions on the electronic transport and thermoelectric effects of a surface states of topological crystalline insulators using the generalized semiclassical boltzmann theory for multiband anisotropic systems .",
    "taking into account both intra- and interband scattering processes , we have obtained that the doping dependence of the conductivity exhibits a local minimum at a transition point , originated from the van hove singularity in the density of states .",
    "the conductivity also illustrates a maximum owing to inter - band - induced transitions of electrons between subbands .",
    "this effect is the direct result of the gapless dirac spectrum of tcis in which the density of states declines linearly with varying the energy toward the dirac point with a vanishing the density of states .",
    "we also reveal that tcis could be very promising material for caloritronics  @xcite studies and applications .",
    "thermopower changes sign several times due to the conversion of electrons to holes and vice versa at each extremum of the conductivity .",
    "therefore , based on this study , we believe that tcis can be used as a base material to investigate thermoelectric phenomena .",
